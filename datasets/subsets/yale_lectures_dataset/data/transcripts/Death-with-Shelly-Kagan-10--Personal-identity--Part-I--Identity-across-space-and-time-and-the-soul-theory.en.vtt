00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.916
Professor Shelly Kagan:
At the end of last class,

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:08.901
I suggested that from here on
out I'm going to be assuming

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:13.024
that there is no soul.
I'm going to be discussing the

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:17.557
issues that we turn to hereafter
from the perspective of the

00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:20.159
physicalist,
the person who says that a

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.726
person is basically just a fancy
body--a body that can do certain

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.773
special tricks,
a body that can function in

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:30.710
certain ways that we associate
with being a person,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.880
a body that can P-function,
as we put it.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.030
Now, I've given you my reasons
for believing there are no

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.267
souls.
Basically, that the various

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:44.174
arguments that might be offered
for believing in souls don't

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:46.890
seem very compelling upon
examination,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.360
so there's no good reason to
posit this extra entity.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.305
For the most part,
then, I'm going to be putting

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:55.898
aside soul talk.
Periodically,

00:00:55.898 --> 00:00:59.490
I'll come back and talk about
how some issue that we are

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.603
considering might look from the
perspective of somebody who does

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.612
believe in souls.
But, as I say,

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:07.575
for the most part,
I'm going to be assuming there

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:09.936
are no souls.
For those of you who still do

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:13.350
believe in the existence of
souls, I suppose you could take

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.763
a great deal of the discussion
that follows as some form of

00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:19.000
large conditional or
subjunctive.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.065
If there were no souls,
then here's what we'd have to

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:26.174
say.
So although I'll be largely

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.828
talking from the perspective of
the physicalist,

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:32.159
if you haven't become convinced
of the truth of physicalism,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.660
so be it.
We'll at least explore what

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.145
will we say about death if we've
decided that people are

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.237
basically just bodies?
Now, you'll recall that at the

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:44.252
start of the semester I said,
in thinking about the question,

00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:47.183
could I survive my death?
there were two basic things we

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:51.067
had to get clear on.
First, we had to get clear on,

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.830
what am I?
What are my parts?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.315
That's why we spent the last
several weeks worrying about the

00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:01.407
question, am I just a body?
Am I a body and an immaterial

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:05.376
soul as well?
Or perhaps, strictly speaking,

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.452
just the soul?
Having looked at that question,

00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.257
we're now going to turn to the
second basic question,

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:15.580
what would it be to survive?
What would it be for a thing

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.523
like that to continue to exist?
Now, of course,

00:02:19.523 --> 00:02:21.714
we're going to ask most
particularly,

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:25.245
what would it be for a thing
like that to survive the death

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.650
of the body?
Could it even make sense for a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.889
person to survive the death of
his body?

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.320
You might think the answer to
that is no, if we are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.035
physicalists,
but in fact,

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:40.259
it's not so clear the answer to
that is no.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.457
But in order to address that
particular question--What is for

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:45.430
me to survive the death of my
body?

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.080
Is that even a possibility or
not?--we first have to get clear

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.731
about the more general question,
what is it for me to survive,

00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.995
period?
Take the more familiar hum-drum

00:02:55.995 --> 00:03:01.633
case.
Here I am lecturing to you

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:07.516
today, Thursday.
Somebody's going to be here,

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:12.210
no doubt, lecturing to you next
week, next Tuesday.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.624
The question of survival can be
asked about that very simple

00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:18.558
case.
Is the person who's going to be

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:23.532
lecturing to you on Tuesday the
very same person as the person

00:03:23.532 --> 00:03:28.099
who is standing in front of you
lecturing to you now?

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.590
Will that person survive the
weekend?

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.569
I certainly expect to survive
the weekend.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.130
But what is it to survive the
weekend?

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.617
What is it?
We might say,

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.460
look, we've already got the
beginnings of an answer.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.382
For me to survive until
Tuesday, presumably is for there

00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:51.409
to be somebody,
some person alive lecturing to

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.915
you on Tuesday,
and--here's the crucial

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:59.938
point--for that person lecturing
to you on Tuesday to be the very

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:04.020
same person as the person
lecturing to you today,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.383
on Thursday.
If I were to be killed in a

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:14.157
plane accident this weekend and
there was a guest lecturer for

00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:17.288
you on Tuesday,
there'd be somebody alive

00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:20.289
lecturing to you.
But, of course,

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.516
that wouldn't be me.
So the question we want to get

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:29.065
clear on is, what is it for
somebody on Tuesday to be the

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:34.019
same person as the person here
talking to you on Thursday?

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.329
We can ask the question more
grandly, about larger expanses

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:42.792
of time.
Suppose there's somebody alive

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:49.480
40-odd years from now,
in the year 2050.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.965
Could that be me?
To ask, have I survived until

00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:57.237
2050?
is to ask, is that person who's

00:04:57.237 --> 00:05:01.746
alive in 2050 the very same
person as the person who's

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:04.980
standing here now lecturing to
you?

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.239
What is it for somebody in the
future to be the very same

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:16.269
person as this person who's here
now today?

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:23.097
Now, in thinking about this
question, it's important not to

00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:29.590
misunderstand what we're asking.
Some of you may misunderstand

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.754
what I'm asking.
Some of you may want to say,

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:36.467
"Look, the person lecturing to
you now has at least a fair bit

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:39.560
of his hair.
He's got a beard.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.493
Let's suppose that the person
alive in 2050 is bald and bent

00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:47.282
over, has no beard.
How could they be the same

00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:48.870
person?
One's got hair, one doesn't.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.458
One's got a beard, one doesn't.
One stands straight,

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:54.129
one's crooked.
It can't be the same person."

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.926
That's the mistake that it's
important for us to get clear

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:03.118
about.
So I'm going to spend some time

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:07.109
talking about examples that I
think we would not find

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:10.274
puzzling,
and work our way back up to the

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:14.106
case of personal identity.
So first I'm going to say some

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:17.610
things about identity across
time--or indeed initially,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.821
identity across space--with
some familiar,

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:28.579
hum-drum, material objects.
So, let's start.

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:33.700
Suppose you and I are walking
along and we see a train.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.400
So let me draw the train first.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.660
I'm not a very good artist,
but all right.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.500
There's our train.
We start walking.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.325
I point to the caboose.
Let's make this look more like

00:07:08.325 --> 00:07:09.740
a caboose, slightly more like a
caboose.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.879
Just so it doesn't look too
much like the locomotive.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:19.579
I point to the caboose and I
say, "Look at that train."

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:23.199
And we're walking along,
we're walking along,

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.746
we're walking along.
We come to the end of the train

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.380
and I point to the locomotive
and I say, "Wow!

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.111
Look how long that train is!
That's the very same train I

00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:36.816
pointed to five minutes ago.
We've been walking along it all

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:39.852
this time."
Now, imagine that you say--you

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:44.796
wouldn't say anything as stupid
as this, but imagine that you

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:48.742
said this--you say,
"This isn't the same train as

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:51.829
the train we pointed to five
minutes ago.

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:56.665
After all, right now what
you're pointing to is a

00:07:56.665 --> 00:08:02.811
locomotive, whereas five minutes
ago what you pointed to was a

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:06.381
caboose.
A caboose isn't the same thing

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:09.217
as a locomotive.
How could you possibly say it's

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.217
the same thing?
Who could possibly make a

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:15.848
mistake like that?
The locomotive's got smoke

00:08:15.848 --> 00:08:19.360
coming out of it.
The caboose doesn't.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.441
And so forth and so on.
There's a lot of differences

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.363
between the two.
How could you make such a silly

00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:26.057
mistake?"
Well, of course,

00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:28.629
what I would then want to say
to you is, no,

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.800
actually, you're the one who's
making the mistake.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.062
I agree, of course,
that a locomotive is not the

00:08:36.062 --> 00:08:40.765
same thing as a caboose.
But I wasn't claiming that it

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:43.765
was.
Rather, initially when we

00:08:43.765 --> 00:08:47.917
started our walk,
I pointed to a caboose,

00:08:47.917 --> 00:08:53.730
but by pointing to the caboose,
I picked out a train.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.815
I said, "Look at that train."
And what I was referring to

00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:03.721
wasn't just the caboose,
but the whole,

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.730
long, extended-through-space
object,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.700
the train, of which the caboose
was just a part.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.173
And when--At the end of our
walk when I pointed to a

00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:19.169
locomotive and said,
"Look at that train,"

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:24.898
by pointing to the locomotive,
I was picking out a train,

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.857
an entire train.
This long,

00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:32.549
extended-through-space object,
the train.

00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:36.298
And when I said,
"This train that I'm pointing

00:09:36.298 --> 00:09:41.213
to now is the very same train as
the train I pointed to five

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:44.762
minutes ago,"
I'm not saying what is

00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:48.992
certainly false.
I'm not saying the locomotive

00:09:48.992 --> 00:09:52.019
is the same thing as the
caboose.

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:56.296
Rather, what I'm saying is,
the entire

00:09:56.296 --> 00:10:03.231
extended-through-space train
that I'm pointing out now is the

00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:09.241
same train as the entire
extended-through-space train

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:13.980
that I picked out five minutes
ago.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.775
And that claim,
far from being false,

00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:20.045
is true.
Now, as I say,

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:23.169
none of us would make that
mistake.

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:26.610
But it's a tempting mistake if
you're not being careful.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.901
And that mistake might mislead
us if we start thinking about

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:32.330
the personal identity case.
But let's continue with the

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.840
train for a bit.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:46.352
Suppose, as we're taking our
walk, part of the train isn't

00:10:46.352 --> 00:10:53.205
visible.
There's a large warehouse

00:10:53.205 --> 00:11:00.220
that's blocking the view.
We're walking along the way.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.559
We see a caboose.
I say, "Ha! There's a train."

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:08.608
Then for a while we're walking,
we don't see anything because

00:11:08.608 --> 00:11:10.970
all you can see is the
warehouse.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.923
And then after we get past the
warehouse, a very long,

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.709
block-long warehouse,
I see a locomotive and I say,

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:19.210
"Hey look.
There's a train."

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.594
And then I ask you,
"Do you think this is the same

00:11:24.594 --> 00:11:29.320
train as the train we pointed to
before?"

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.610
Now again, it's important not
to misunderstand that question.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.627
That question is not asking,
is the locomotive that we're

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:42.734
pointing to now the same as the
caboose that we pointed to

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:44.980
earlier?
No, of course not.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.850
The locomotive's not the same
as the caboose.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.091
But that's not what I'm asking.
What I'm asking rather is,

00:11:52.091 --> 00:11:56.409
remember earlier when I pointed
to the caboose?"

00:11:56.409 --> 00:12:00.449
In doing so,
and I started talking about a

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:06.164
train, I was picking out some
entire extended-through-space

00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:08.921
train.
Right now, in pointing to a

00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:12.399
locomotive, I'm picking out not
just the locomotive.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.370
I mean to be talking about an
entire train.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.679
Some entire
extended-through-space train.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:22.595
And I'm asking not about the
locomotive and the caboose,

00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:27.009
but rather I'm asking about the
trains that I pick out by means

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:32.710
of the locomotive and caboose.
Are they the same train?

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.450
And the answer is, "Don't know;
can't tell.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.289
The building's blocking the
view."

00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:48.730
Suppose we had x-ray vision and
could see through the building.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.549
Then the answer would be,
"Well look, if what we've got

00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:58.643
is something like this,
then of course,

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:04.005
we do have one single train."
The extended-through-space

00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:08.103
train I picked out at the end of
our walk is the same as the

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:11.714
extended-through-space train
that I picked out at the

00:13:11.714 --> 00:13:15.672
beginning of our walk.
But it might not turn out that

00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:17.147
way.
It might turn out if I had

00:13:17.147 --> 00:13:18.970
x-ray vision,
that what I'd see is this .

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.915
Then the answer would be,
"Ah, there's not one train

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:34.902
here, but two trains."
The extended-through-space

00:13:34.902 --> 00:13:39.152
train that I'm picking out when
I point to the locomotive turns

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:43.539
out to be a different train from
the extended-through-space train

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.830
I picked out when I pointed to
the caboose.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.277
I don't have x-ray vision.
I don't know which of these

00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:56.309
metaphysical hypotheses is the
correct one.

00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:59.539
All right, easy enough with
trains.

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:00.550
We know how it works with
trains.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:13.192
Now let's talk about something
not a whole lot more

00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:20.626
complicated--cars.
I used to have a car I bought

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:24.390
in 1990.
My ability to draw cars is even

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.370
worse than my ability to draw
trains.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:33.190
There's my car in 1990.
It was new.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.875
It was sparkly.
Then I drove it for some years

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:41.990
and I got some dents and so
forth and so on.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:47.432
Here's a smile.
By 1996 or 2000,

00:14:47.432 --> 00:14:49.410
it wasn't looking so good.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.700
The sparkle had gone.
It had a couple of dents.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:13.226
That was the car in 2000.
By 2006, it had a lot of dents,

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:23.056
2006, when it finally died.
All right, now we all

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:29.874
understand the claim that the
car I had in 2006 was the very

00:15:29.874 --> 00:15:34.149
same car as the car I had in
1990.

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:38.405
Of course, again,
you've got to be careful not to

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:44.035
misunderstand what's being said.
We all know that in 2006 the

00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:49.826
car had a lot of scratches and
had gotten banged in on one side

00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:54.964
and pretty sorry looking in
terms of the scrapes and the

00:15:54.964 --> 00:16:01.369
paint job and the rust.
Whereas, the car in 1990,

00:16:01.369 --> 00:16:09.619
new and shiny and smooth.
You might say the 2006 car

00:16:09.619 --> 00:16:19.730
stage is obviously not the same
thing as the 1990 car stage.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.668
That's like thinking that the
locomotive's the same thing as

00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:27.950
the caboose.
But when I say it's the same

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.720
car, I don't mean to be talking
about car stages.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:42.295
I mean to be talking about a
single thing that was extended

00:16:42.295 --> 00:16:47.849
through time.
There I am, proud owner of my

00:16:47.849 --> 00:16:52.029
new car in 1990 and I say,
"This is a car.

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:54.700
It's a car that will exist for
more than a few minutes.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.630
It's a car that will exist for
years and years and years,"

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.630
though at the time I didn't
realize it was going to last 16

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.336
years or longer.
When I refer to my car--as

00:17:06.336 --> 00:17:12.065
opposed to what we could dub the
car stage or the car slice--when

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:19.084
I refer to the car in 1990,
I mean to be talking about the

00:17:19.084 --> 00:17:24.430
entire extended-through-time
object.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.537
In 2006, when I point to that
sad heap and talk about,

00:17:29.537 --> 00:17:32.910
"I've had that car for 16
years."

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.809
Well, I haven't had that car
stage for 16 years.

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:40.331
That car stage or that car
slice, if we wanted to talk

00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:43.122
about it that way,
has only been around for

00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:44.916
however long,
months, years,

00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:46.788
a year.
It hasn't been around for 16

00:17:46.788 --> 00:17:49.771
years.
But when I talk about that car,

00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:54.352
I'm picking not just the
current slice or the current

00:17:54.352 --> 00:17:57.084
stage of the car,
but the entire

00:17:57.084 --> 00:18:02.750
extended-through-time object.
When I say, "That's the very

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:08.474
same car I've had for 16 years,"
I mean, "Think of the object

00:18:08.474 --> 00:18:14.197
extended through time that I'm
picking out by pointing to the

00:18:14.197 --> 00:18:17.511
current slice.
That's the very same

00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:21.866
extended-through-time object
that I picked out 16 years ago

00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:25.620
by pointing to what was then the
current slice.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.190
The slices aren't the same;
the car is the same.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.570
It's the very same car."

00:18:41.849 --> 00:18:48.640
Well, now let's imagine a
somewhat more difficult case.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.990
At the end of 2006,
my engine failed.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:57.109
I sold the car to a dealer,
junk dealer.

00:18:57.109 --> 00:19:08.922
Suppose that in 2010 I see a
car in the junk lot and it looks

00:19:08.922 --> 00:19:12.270
familiar to me.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.880
I say, "Whoa!
That's my car."

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:31.417
Is it or isn't it my car?
This is sort of like the case

00:19:31.417 --> 00:19:36.230
with the factory blocking the
view.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:42.678
1990 to 2006, very easy.
Saw the car every day in my

00:19:42.678 --> 00:19:44.658
garage.
But here is a

00:19:44.658 --> 00:19:48.974
four-year--Instead of a factory
blocking my view,

00:19:48.974 --> 00:19:52.840
it's the mists of time blocking
my view.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.538
And I ask, "Same car or not?"
Again, by this time,

00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:58.727
I imagine you don't need to be
warned, but let me just warn you

00:19:58.727 --> 00:20:01.547
a couple more times.
I'm not asking,

00:20:01.547 --> 00:20:05.586
"Is the car stage,
the 2010 car stage,

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:10.390
the same car stage as the 2006
car stage?

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.710
Maybe not.
Maybe obviously not.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.649
I'm asking rather,
in pointing to the 2010 car

00:20:18.649 --> 00:20:25.454
stage, I mean to be picking out
an entire extended-through-time

00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:28.512
entity, the car.
And I'm asking,

00:20:28.512 --> 00:20:31.559
"Is that the very same
extended-through-time entity as

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.780
the extended-through-time entity
that I used to own?"

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.359
I wonder.
And the answer is, "Don't know."

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:41.460
The mists of time are blocking
my view.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.693
I don't know the answer.
But we know what the

00:20:43.693 --> 00:20:44.960
possibilities are.

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:57.922
One possibility is that indeed
it's the very same--I won't draw

00:20:57.922 --> 00:21:05.480
it all, 2008 and so forth.
It could be the very same car.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.355
If we knew what it took to have
the various stages of a car add

00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:15.713
up to the very same car,
then that would be one

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:20.495
possibility.
But there might be a different

00:21:20.495 --> 00:21:24.315
possibility.
It could have been that after I

00:21:24.315 --> 00:21:27.496
sold it to the junk dealer,
he crushed it,

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:32.539
turned it into a heap of metal
and that was the end of my car.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:41.662
And the car I'm seeing on the
dealer's lot in 2010 might be

00:21:41.662 --> 00:21:47.640
some other car with its own
history.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.523
What we're wondering about is,
is there a single--well,

00:21:52.523 --> 00:21:57.948
here's a piece of jargon--is
there a single "space-time worm"

00:21:57.948 --> 00:22:02.819
here or are there two?
When I look at the car in 2010

00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:06.848
and say, "There's a car.
I wonder if it's the same car,"

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:10.019
I'm asking about this thing
that's extended--well,

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:13.786
obviously through space,
since cars take up some

00:22:13.786 --> 00:22:17.470
space--and through time.
Looks a bit like a worm.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.500
So philosophers call them
space-time worms.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.765
Is the space-time worm that
makes up this car the same

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:29.710
space-time worm as the one that
made up my car?

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:33.858
One worm there or two?
And the answer might be,

00:22:33.858 --> 00:22:36.519
"Don't know,
need to have more facts."

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:39.569
But at least that's what the
question is.

00:22:39.569 --> 00:22:44.841
Now metaphysically,
there's different ways of

00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:52.630
trying to pose the set of issues
that I've begun to talk about.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.728
Should we say,
as we might say with the train,

00:22:56.728 --> 00:23:00.736
the train is made up out of the
various cars,

00:23:00.736 --> 00:23:03.196
the locomotive,
the caboose,

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:08.061
and the intervening cars?
So the train--that's the way we

00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:11.684
normally think about trains,
at least the way I normally

00:23:11.684 --> 00:23:15.175
think about trains--the train's
a bit like a sandwich,

00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:17.365
right?
The metaphysically fundamental

00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:19.270
things are the caboose,
the locomotives,

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.965
the intervening trains.
If they're glued together in

00:23:22.965 --> 00:23:26.170
the right way,
they make up a train.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.900
What's the right kind of
metaphysical glue for trains?

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:35.309
Well, it's being connected with
those little locks.

00:23:35.309 --> 00:23:39.011
That may or may not be the
right way to think about what

00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:42.039
I've been calling car stages or
car slices.

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:44.392
On some metaphysical views,
you might say,

00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:46.400
just exactly like with the
train,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.201
the car stages are the
metaphysically fundamental

00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:53.607
things and a car,
something extended through

00:23:53.607 --> 00:23:58.297
time,
is glued together like a

00:23:58.297 --> 00:24:04.873
sandwich from the car stages.
And then, we might worry about

00:24:04.873 --> 00:24:07.440
what's the relevant metaphysical
glue for cars.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.863
On other metaphysical views,
no what's really prior is the

00:24:11.863 --> 00:24:15.898
car itself, and talking about
car stages is a certain

00:24:15.898 --> 00:24:19.352
convenience,
a kind of way of chopping up

00:24:19.352 --> 00:24:21.880
the fundamental thing,
the car.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.230
So, to use an analogy that I
think David Kaplan,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.277
a philosopher at UCLA offers,
it's as though you have to

00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:33.660
think of it more like a bologna
or salami that you can slice.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.995
If--For certain purposes you
can talk about slices,

00:24:36.995 --> 00:24:39.730
but the fundamental thing's the
salami.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.259
All right.
In thinking about cars,

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:46.977
should we say that the
fundamental thing is the car

00:24:46.977 --> 00:24:51.809
stages and they get put together
like a sandwich to make cars?

00:24:51.809 --> 00:24:54.627
Or should we think that the
fundamental thing is the car

00:24:54.627 --> 00:24:58.059
extended through time and it can
be sliced up to make car stages?

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:00.767
For our purposes,
I think we won't have to go

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:02.000
there.
It doesn't really matter.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.593
As long as we're comfortable
talking about entire space-time

00:25:06.593 --> 00:25:10.329
worms, the cars,
and the slices or the stages.

00:25:10.329 --> 00:25:13.150
We don't have to ask which is
metaphysically prior.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.703
You should also notice that- I
should also mention that there

00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:19.901
are other metaphysical views
about what goes on when an

00:25:19.901 --> 00:25:23.972
object exists over time.
I've been here helping myself

00:25:23.972 --> 00:25:29.212
to the suggestion that we should
think about extension over time

00:25:29.212 --> 00:25:34.369
analogously to the way we think
about extension over space.

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:37.345
That's why I started with a
spatial example,

00:25:37.345 --> 00:25:40.389
the train, and moved to the
temporal example,

00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:42.144
the car.
And there are those

00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:45.016
philosophers who think that's
exactly the right way to think

00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:47.205
about it and those philosophers
that think no,

00:25:47.205 --> 00:25:51.034
no, that's misleading.
When an object is extended over

00:25:51.034 --> 00:25:55.818
time, really the entire object's
right there at every single

00:25:55.818 --> 00:25:58.053
moment.
These are interesting and

00:25:58.053 --> 00:26:01.412
difficult questions.
But again, I think for our

00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:04.490
purposes, we don't have to go
there.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.943
So I will help myself to this
language of space-time worms,

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:15.680
objects that extend not only
over space but also over time.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.510
And distinguish the entire worm
from the various slices or

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.609
stages that either make up the
worm or that we could slice the

00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:26.545
worm into.
The point that I've been

00:26:26.545 --> 00:26:29.207
emphasizing is,
well first point,

00:26:29.207 --> 00:26:33.365
of course, has been,
"Don't confuse the stages with

00:26:33.365 --> 00:26:38.346
the entire space-time worm."
The stages can differ without

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:42.279
the entire space-time worm being
a different worm.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:45.608
Second question I've hinted at
that we're about to turn to,

00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:47.789
not literally turn to at the
moment,

00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:52.029
but shortly we'll turn to is,
"What's the relevant glue?"

00:26:52.029 --> 00:27:00.940
What makes two stages,
stages of the very same thing?

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.030
In the case of trains,
as I say, it's fairly obvious.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:11.670
What is it in the case of cars?
What makes the 1990 car stage a

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:19.613
stage in the very same car,
the extended through space and

00:27:19.613 --> 00:27:24.630
time worm car,
as the 2006 stage?

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.492
What's the metaphysical glue
that glues these stages

00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:29.308
together?
And the answer,

00:27:29.308 --> 00:27:33.781
not that there aren't puzzles
about it, but the answer is

00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:38.917
roughly,
"It's the very same car if it's

00:27:38.917 --> 00:27:46.060
the very same hunk of metal and
plastic and wires."

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:52.950
There was the car.
A car is just some metal and

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:58.292
plastic, rubber.
And that very same hunk

00:27:58.292 --> 00:28:03.890
continued into 2000 and it
continued into 2006.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:13.068
The glue, the key to identity
across time for cars,

00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:19.309
is being the same hunk of
stuff.

00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:26.840
Now, that doesn't mean it's got
to be the same atom for atom.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.639
We know that's not true.
Look, think about my steering

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:32.269
wheel.
Every time I grabbed the

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:37.540
steering wheel to drive,
I wore away thousands of atoms.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:49.458
You can lose some atoms and
still be the very same steering

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:52.271
wheel.
Every now and then,

00:28:52.271 --> 00:28:55.660
I'd replace the tires on my
car.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.319
But for all that,
it was the same hunk of stuff.

00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:03.869
Now this raises an interesting
issue.

00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:10.859
How many changes of the
constituent parts can you have

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:15.869
and still be the same hunk of
stuff?

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:20.822
If this was a class in which we
were going to worry about the

00:29:20.822 --> 00:29:24.289
general problem of identity
across time,

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:28.880
this would be a problem we'd
have to directly face.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.019
But since we are only looking
at enough of the problem of

00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:37.380
identity to get to the question
that we really want to think

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.002
about,
the nature of personal identity

00:29:41.002 --> 00:29:45.000
across time, I'm not going to
pursue that.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.652
I just want to flag the thought
that you can be the very same

00:29:49.652 --> 00:29:53.141
hunk of stuff,
even if some of the constituent

00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:56.010
atoms have changed along the
way.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.775
And even bigger parts.
You can replace the headlights

00:29:59.775 --> 00:30:02.839
and still be the same hunk of
stuff.

00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:06.153
At any rate,
that's what's gone on in the

00:30:06.153 --> 00:30:09.549
car case, same hunk of stuff
1900-2006.

00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:14.125
And when I see the car on the
junk dealer's yard in 2010 and

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:19.244
ask, "Is that my car or not?"
the answer lies in--if only we

00:30:19.244 --> 00:30:23.859
could know--is that the same
hunk of stuff or not?

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:28.069
That's what the key,
the metaphysical glue is,

00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:34.778
being the same hunk of stuff.
All right, let's turn now to

00:30:34.778 --> 00:30:41.850
the case we really wonder about,
personal identity.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:31:02.180
Here's somebody lecturing to
you in 2007, Shelly Kagan.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:10.686
We imagine there's somebody in
2050 and we ask,

00:31:10.686 --> 00:31:20.700
"Is that Shelly Kagan?"
We'll call him "Mr. X."

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.950
We ask, "Is that the same
person or not?"

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.030
Now again, at this point you're
not going to be tempted by the

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.103
mistake.
I'm not asking,

00:31:31.103 --> 00:31:39.757
"Is this person stage Mr.
X the same person stage as SK

00:31:39.757 --> 00:31:42.890
2007?"
Obviously not.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:47.116
SK 2007 has still got his hair,
has the beard,

00:31:47.116 --> 00:31:50.309
stands up more or less
straight.

00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:52.705
Mr.
X is bald, doesn't have a

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:56.654
beard.
I suppose I should have drawn

00:31:56.654 --> 00:31:59.350
him bent.
Can I do that?

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.325
A little cane.
I'm not asking,

00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:09.925
"Is the person stage Mr.
X the same as the person stage

00:32:09.925 --> 00:32:13.031
SK 2007?"
Sounds like a computer or

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:15.112
something.
Get the SK 2007!

00:32:15.112 --> 00:32:19.373
I'm not asking that.
I'm asking, I'm saying,

00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:24.013
"Look, when you look at the
current stage,

00:32:24.013 --> 00:32:29.672
the current person slice and
think about the entire

00:32:29.672 --> 00:32:37.357
extended-through-time entity,
the person that makes up Shelly

00:32:37.357 --> 00:32:45.033
Kagan, or that is Shelly Kagan,
is that the very same person as

00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:52.585
the extended-through-time person
that you got in mind when you

00:32:52.585 --> 00:32:56.299
point to the Mr.
X 2050?"

00:32:56.299 --> 00:32:58.869
The stages are obviously
different.

00:32:58.869 --> 00:33:04.956
But by looking at the stages,
we pick out a space-time worm

00:33:04.956 --> 00:33:08.933
that makes up a person.
And we're asking,

00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:12.994
"Is that the very same
space-time worm as the one we

00:33:12.994 --> 00:33:17.454
picked out previously or a
different space-time worm than

00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:20.559
the one we picked out
previously?"

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:24.659
And the answer,
presumably, is going to be,

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:30.319
"Well it depends on getting
clear on whether the stages are

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:35.200
glued together in the right
metaphysical way."

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:41.717
And so, what we'd like to know
is, well, what does it take for

00:33:41.717 --> 00:33:47.594
two person stages to make up or
be part of the very same

00:33:47.594 --> 00:33:53.541
extended-through-time person?
What's the metaphysical glue

00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:58.730
that underlies being a single
extended-through-time person?

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:04.990
What's the key to personal
identity?

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.355
If we could get clear about
what the answer to that

00:34:08.355 --> 00:34:11.989
metaphysical question,
the key to personal identity,

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:18.441
we'd at least know what we
needed to find out to answer the

00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:22.889
question, "Is this one person or
two?"

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:29.440
Are the pieces glued together
in the right way?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.066
Different question,
the question that we're

00:34:33.066 --> 00:34:36.520
ultimately hoping to get an
answer to.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.494
Could I survive my death?
Well look, think again about

00:34:40.494 --> 00:34:45.059
the question we started with.
Could I survive the weekend?

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:50.259
To survive the weekend,
there's got to be somebody

00:34:50.259 --> 00:34:56.519
who's alive, some person on
Tuesday and that person's got to

00:34:56.519 --> 00:35:03.310
be the very same person as the
person you're looking at now,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:09.532
you're thinking about now.
Or to put it in terms of

00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:15.199
stages, that person's got to
be--that stage,

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:20.602
that slice has to be part of
the very same

00:35:20.602 --> 00:35:28.510
extended-through-time space-time
worm as this stage is.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.550
They've got to be glued
together in the right way.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.605
We can't tell whether that's
true until we know what the glue

00:35:34.605 --> 00:35:36.649
is.
But at least we anticipate

00:35:36.649 --> 00:35:40.504
that, well, there will be
somebody here on Tuesday who is

00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:43.322
glued together in that way,
the right way,

00:35:43.322 --> 00:35:46.754
whatever that turns out to be.
The stages will be glued

00:35:46.754 --> 00:35:52.091
together in the right way.
Suppose I asked then,

00:35:52.091 --> 00:35:57.857
"Will I survive my death?"
All right, so I'm going to be

00:35:57.857 --> 00:36:01.177
optimistic.
I'm going to assume that I make

00:36:01.177 --> 00:36:04.670
it to 2040.
2040… I won't even be 90 yet.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.719
That's not too wildly
optimistic.

00:36:06.719 --> 00:36:10.780
It's optimistic,
but not wildly optimistic.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:19.045
So here's the SK 2040.
We know that there's an

00:36:19.045 --> 00:36:25.129
extended through space and time,
space-time worm,

00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:30.610
a person.
Then let's suppose,

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:38.615
sadly, 2041 my body dies.
And I ask, "Could I survive my

00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:42.579
death, that is to say,
the death of my body?"

00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:51.571
Well, we want to know,
after 2041, let's say 2045,

00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:59.829
is there somebody who's a
person, call him Mr.

00:36:59.829 --> 00:37:04.313
X.
Could it be the case that

00:37:04.313 --> 00:37:12.027
there'd be a person in 2045,
after the death of my body in

00:37:12.027 --> 00:37:15.711
2041,
could it be the case that

00:37:15.711 --> 00:37:21.956
there's a person who is part of
the very same space-time worm

00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:26.120
that you're thinking about right
now?

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:32.649
Could that be or not?
We can't answer that question

00:37:32.649 --> 00:37:38.937
until we are clearer about what
does it take to have identity

00:37:38.937 --> 00:37:42.416
across time.
What's the key to personal

00:37:42.416 --> 00:37:44.659
identity?
What's the metaphysical glue?

00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:48.197
Once we get clear about what
the relevant metaphysical glue

00:37:48.197 --> 00:37:50.759
is, we'll be in a position to
start asking,

00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:52.650
"Could this happen or not?"

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.534
All right, that's the question
I want to turn to,

00:38:05.534 --> 00:38:08.206
then.
What are the possible positions

00:38:08.206 --> 00:38:12.295
on this question?
What's the key to personal

00:38:12.295 --> 00:38:15.980
identity?
What's it to be the very same

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.444
person?
As we might put it somewhat

00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:23.814
misleadingly,
what is it for "two" people to

00:38:23.814 --> 00:38:29.710
really be the same single
extended-through-time person?

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:34.469
Suppose we believed in souls.
Then here would be a natural

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:38.075
proposal.
The metaphysical key to

00:38:38.075 --> 00:38:44.140
personal identity is having the
very same soul.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.223
So suppose I was a dualist.
I'd say, "Look,

00:38:47.223 --> 00:38:51.049
you're looking at a body,
but connected in this intimate

00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:53.762
way with this body is a
particular soul,

00:38:53.762 --> 00:38:58.289
the soul of Shelly Kagan.
What makes it true that the

00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:03.170
person lecturing to you next
Tuesday is Shelly Kagan,

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.782
the very same person,
what makes that true is that

00:39:07.782 --> 00:39:12.985
it's the very same soul.
As long as this soul is here

00:39:12.985 --> 00:39:17.019
again on Tuesday,
It'll be Shelly Kagan.

00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:20.600
If it's a different soul,
it's not Shelly Kagan."

00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:29.822
That's the natural thing to
suggest if we believe in the

00:39:29.822 --> 00:39:32.605
soul view.
The key to personal

00:39:32.605 --> 00:39:37.353
identity--not the only thing a
soul theorist can say,

00:39:37.353 --> 00:39:42.741
but the natural thing for a
soul theorist to say--the key to

00:39:42.741 --> 00:39:47.490
personal identity is having the
very same soul.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:53.448
Same soul, same person.
Different soul,

00:39:53.448 --> 00:39:59.802
different person.
Imagine that God or a demon or

00:39:59.802 --> 00:40:04.493
what have you,
for whatever perverse reason,

00:40:04.493 --> 00:40:11.148
severs the ordinary connection
between my body and my soul and

00:40:11.148 --> 00:40:17.817
then reconnects the wires,
as it were, so that there's a

00:40:17.817 --> 00:40:23.712
different soul animating and
controlling this body on

00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:26.540
Tuesday.
For whatever perverse reasons,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.070
maybe to make some sort of
philosophical point,

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:34.832
that person decides to come in
anyway on Tuesday and lecture to

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:39.020
you about philosophy.
According to the view that

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.331
we're taking,
which we'll now call the soul

00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:46.826
view, according to the soul
view, it won't be me lecturing

00:40:46.826 --> 00:40:49.500
to you on Tuesday.
Why not?

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.650
Because we've just stipulated
it's not the same soul.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:41:00.633
It's a different soul.
The key to personal identity,

00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:05.709
according to the soul theory of
personal identity,

00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:11.510
the key to personal identity is
having the same soul.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.070
When I ask myself,
"Will I survive the weekend?"

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.957
what I'm asking is,
"Will my soul still be around

00:41:18.957 --> 00:41:19.920
come Tuesday?"

00:41:23.929 --> 00:41:26.816
As long as my soul still exists
and is functioning,

00:41:26.816 --> 00:41:30.250
it's still me.
I'm still around.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.576
In fact--peeking ahead of
course, and this is why we are

00:41:34.576 --> 00:41:38.510
often drawn to soul views--even
if my body dies,

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:44.309
as long as my soul continues to
exist, I continue to exist.

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:47.144
The key to personal identity,
according to the soul view,

00:41:47.144 --> 00:41:50.279
is having the same soul.
As long as my soul continues to

00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:53.271
exist, it's still me,
whether or not my body's still

00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:53.800
alive.

00:41:59.739 --> 00:42:02.655
And it's precisely for this
reason that at least the soul,

00:42:02.655 --> 00:42:06.058
belief in the soul,
combined with the soul theory

00:42:06.058 --> 00:42:09.993
of personal identity,
holds out the possibility of

00:42:09.993 --> 00:42:13.594
surviving my death.
We may not know that the soul

00:42:13.594 --> 00:42:17.136
will continue to exist after the
destruction of the body,

00:42:17.136 --> 00:42:19.920
but at least it seems like a
possibility.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.419
Plato of course,
as we know, tried to argue that

00:42:22.419 --> 00:42:24.812
we could know,
that there was--there were good

00:42:24.812 --> 00:42:27.949
grounds for believing the soul
would continue to exist.

00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:31.869
I've said I don't find those
grounds so convincing.

00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:34.885
But even if we didn't think we
could show that the soul would

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:37.778
continue to exist,
at least it could,

00:42:37.778 --> 00:42:42.160
it would make perfect sense to
think about it continuing to

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.256
exist.
And so I could survive the

00:42:45.256 --> 00:42:47.971
death of my body.
In contrast,

00:42:47.971 --> 00:42:53.094
it looks--Prospects don't look
so promising for surviving my

00:42:53.094 --> 00:42:57.175
death of my body if we don't
believe in dualism,

00:42:57.175 --> 00:43:00.640
if we're physicalists.
If a person's just a

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.385
P-functioning body,
how could it be that after the

00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:05.570
death of his body he's still
around?

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.190
Well, we'll say more about that
a little bit later.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:16.673
Come back to the soul view.
It's me as long as it's the

00:43:16.673 --> 00:43:19.826
same soul.
It's not me if it's a different

00:43:19.826 --> 00:43:23.146
soul.
Now consider the following

00:43:23.146 --> 00:43:27.497
possibility.
Suppose that over the weekend,

00:43:27.497 --> 00:43:30.201
at 3:00 a.m.,
Saturday night,

00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:34.153
Sunday morning,
while I'm asleep,

00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:39.623
God replaces my soul with a
different soul,

00:43:39.623 --> 00:43:44.817
hooks it up to the body,
gives that soul,

00:43:44.817 --> 00:43:49.117
that replacement soul,
all of my memories,

00:43:49.117 --> 00:43:53.916
all of my beliefs,
all of my desires,

00:43:53.916 --> 00:43:59.344
all of my intentions.
Somebody wakes up Sunday

00:43:59.344 --> 00:44:03.290
morning and says,
"Hey, it's a great day.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.930
Wonderful to be alive.
I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.360
Got to get to work."
Whatever it is.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:14.010
Says "I'm Shelly Kagan";
but he's not.

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.539
According to the soul view,
he's not.

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:22.049
Because according to the soul
theory of personal identity,

00:44:22.049 --> 00:44:25.610
to be me that person's got to
have my soul.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.980
And in this story,
he doesn't have my soul.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.653
My soul got destroyed,
let's suppose,

00:44:32.653 --> 00:44:35.390
3:00 a.m.
Sunday morning.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:40.170
A new soul got created.
It's not me.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:43.250
There's a person there,
all right.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.730
It's a person that doesn't have
a very long history.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.360
Maybe he'll go on to have a
long history.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.900
But it's a different extended
through space and time person

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.579
than the one you're thinking
about right now.

00:44:57.579 --> 00:45:01.655
Because, according to the soul
view, to be me it's got to have

00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:05.530
the same soul and we just
stipulated, not the same soul.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:13.133
Think about what that means.
If God were to replace my soul

00:45:13.133 --> 00:45:17.000
Saturday night,
I die.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.810
And the thing that wakes up
Sunday isn't me.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:27.981
Of course, he'd think he was me.
He'd think to himself,

00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:33.565
"I'm the very same person who
was lecturing about philosophy

00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:39.329
last week."
But he'd be wrong.

00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:42.409
It isn't the same person,
because it's not the same soul.

00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:49.405
He'd be wrong and--notice
this--there'd be no way at all

00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:53.150
he could tell.
He could check his beliefs.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.900
He can check his desires.
He can check his memories.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.378
But that's not the key to
personal identity,

00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:02.699
according to the soul view.
The key to personal identity,

00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:06.000
according to the soul view,
is having the very same soul.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.398
You can't check that.
You can't see the soul to see

00:46:09.398 --> 00:46:10.770
if it's the same one.

00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:19.140
So if this were to happen to
him, he wouldn't be Shelly

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.059
Kagan, the person who'd been
lecturing last week.

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:28.610
But there'd be no way at all he
could know that.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:34.084
And now the question you would
need to ask yourself is,

00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:39.659
how do you know this didn't
happen to you last night?

00:46:39.659 --> 00:46:43.541
You woke up this morning
thinking, I'm the very same

00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:47.347
person--Joe, Linda,
Sally, whatever it is--the very

00:46:47.347 --> 00:46:50.620
same person who was in class
yesterday.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.679
How do you know?
How could you possibly know?

00:46:54.679 --> 00:46:57.613
If God replaced your soul with
a new one, destroyed the old

00:46:57.613 --> 00:46:59.889
one, gave the new one all the
old memories,

00:46:59.889 --> 00:47:03.030
beliefs, desires,
goals, and so forth,

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.510
that person who was in class
last week,

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:11.876
yesterday, died.
The person who's here now

00:47:11.876 --> 00:47:16.600
hasn't been around 10 years,
20 years, what have you.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:22.279
You were born a few hours ago.
And there'd be no way at all

00:47:22.279 --> 00:47:26.824
that you could possibly tell.
How do you know,

00:47:26.824 --> 00:47:30.948
not only that it didn't happen
to you last night,

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:36.274
how do you know something like
this doesn't happen every single

00:47:36.274 --> 00:47:39.605
night,
every hour on the hour,

00:47:39.605 --> 00:47:42.510
every minute,
every second?

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.805
God whips out the old soul,
destroys it,

00:47:45.805 --> 00:47:50.960
puts in a new one with--Maybe
souls only last for a minute and

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.677
a half.
If that was happening,

00:47:53.677 --> 00:47:56.440
then people don't last very
long.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.397
Bodies may last 20 years,
50 years, 80 years,

00:47:59.397 --> 00:48:02.623
100 years, but people would
only last an hour or,

00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:04.841
if it's every minute
substitution,

00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:09.979
a minute.
And you'd never possibly be

00:48:09.979 --> 00:48:15.031
able to tell.
Now these worries were raised

00:48:15.031 --> 00:48:19.448
by John Locke,
the great British philosopher,

00:48:19.448 --> 00:48:23.464
and he thought,
this is too big a pill to

00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:27.772
swallow.
This is too big a bullet to

00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:30.608
bite.
We can't take seriously the

00:48:30.608 --> 00:48:35.347
suggestion that there's no way
at all to tell whether it was

00:48:35.347 --> 00:48:38.639
still me from the one day to the
next,

00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:43.298
from one hour to the next,
from one minute to the next,

00:48:43.298 --> 00:48:46.785
just not plausible.
It's not that there's anything

00:48:46.785 --> 00:48:49.435
incoherent about this view.
It doesn't say anything

00:48:49.435 --> 00:48:51.369
logically contradictory about
this view.

00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:54.541
You just have to ask yourself,
"Could this really be what

00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:58.472
personal identity is all about?
That there'd be no way at all

00:48:58.472 --> 00:49:02.526
to tell whether I've survived
from one minute to the next,

00:49:02.526 --> 00:49:06.392
from one hour to the next?"
Locke thought no,

00:49:06.392 --> 00:49:12.506
you couldn't possibly take this
view seriously if you thought

00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:17.797
about what it meant.
Notice, this is not an argument

00:49:17.797 --> 00:49:22.001
that souls don't exist.
If you find this argument

00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:26.151
convincing, what it's an
argument for is the claim that

00:49:26.151 --> 00:49:30.669
even if souls do exist,
they may not be the key to

00:49:30.669 --> 00:49:34.155
personal identity.
And so what we have to ask

00:49:34.155 --> 00:49:36.559
ourselves is,
what's the alternative?

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:41.654
What better suggestion is there
for what we could point to as

00:49:41.654 --> 00:49:46.239
the metaphysical glue,
the key to personal identity?

00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:50.000
And that's the question that
we'll take up next time.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.229
Prof: The situation with
Paul's church in Corinth is very

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.390
different from the situation we
saw in 1 Thessalonians.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.120
1 Thessalonians shows us a
church that is new in its

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.460
infancy, it has just been
founded.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.560
1 Corinthians shows us a church
in its sort of adolescent

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.380
period.
 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.445
They've had some growing pains,
and they've got some problems,

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.510
but you can tell that they're
not all brand new Christians.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.733
Look at 1 Corinthians 15--take
your Bibles out,

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:44.040
remember you have to follow
along--1 Corinthians 15;

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.343
this is when Paul is addressing
the issue of the resurrection of

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:47.920
the body.
 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.091
Early Christian groups wrestled
with the kind of question that

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:56.125
people sometimes still do which
is, what happens to you when

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:57.220
you're dead?
 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.765
Are you dead like Rover and
dead all over or does your soul

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:04.171
go off to some other place,
or does some part of you get

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:06.420
reincarnated into somebody
else's body?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.230
In the orthodox Christian
confessions, you confess the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.686
resurrection of the body at the
end of time, at the end of this

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:15.909
worldly time.
 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.030
So Christians were dealing with
this stuff.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.412
Paul has to address this
question in 1 Corinthians 15

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.070
because there's some confusion
or some debate in the church

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.530
there.
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.680
Read along with me.
 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.581
1 Corinthians 15:20,
I'm going to skip around a bit

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.030
but I'm going to cover a lot of
ground in this lecture.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.694
You need to really follow along
in the text as best you can so

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:39.160
you don't get confused with
where I am.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.254
1 Corinthians 15:20:
But in fact Christ has been

00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:46.782
raised from the dead,
the first fruits of those who

00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:47.700
have died.
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.873
For since death came through a
human being, the resurrection of

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:53.280
the dead has also come through a
human being.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.759
For as all die in Adam,
so all will be made alive in

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.550
Christ.
 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.043
But each in his own order:
Christ the first fruits,

00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:05.400
then at his coming those who
belong to Christ.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.247
Then comes the end when he
hands over the kingdom to God

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:11.096
the Father, after he has
destroyed every ruler and every

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.650
authority and every power.
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.639
Notice the resurrection of
Jesus for Paul,

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.758
this is going to be very
important,

00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:20.526
the resurrection of Jesus for
Paul is not different in kind

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:23.840
from the resurrection that
Christians can expect.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.341
The resurrection of Christians'
bodies will be just like the

00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:31.240
resurrection of Jesus' body in
kind.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.080
That's important because a
whole lot of people think that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.580
what Jesus experienced,
what the early Christians

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.452
believe about Jesus,
was something very different

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:42.199
from what they confess about
Christians,

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.288
but for Paul they're the same
kind of resurrection.

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:46.859
That's why he just calls
Christ's resurrection "the

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.840
first fruits."
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.160
It's just the first apple on
the tree,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.360
it just lets you know that
harvest time is now here,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.937
but it's just the first apple,
you'll have lots of other

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:56.360
apples.
 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.265
Christ's resurrection is the
first fruits and then there's a

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:06.340
big war type thing and then
Christ defeats all the rulers,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.984
and the authorities,
and powers on earth and hands

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.008
over the kingdom.
 

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:12.502
Verse 25: "For he must
reign until he has put all his

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:14.771
enemies under his feet,
for the last enemy to be

00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.000
destroyed is death."
 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.669
That's good enough for that
point, but now skip down to

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:24.240
verse 35.
 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.051
What happens is that some
people in Corinth are

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.039
questioning this.
 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.080
Now what are they questioning?
 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.192
Are they saying that people
don't live forever at all or

00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:35.690
that there's no afterlife
experience?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.614
It looks like not,
it looks like what they're

00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:40.500
really questioning is simply the
resurrection of the body idea,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.364
because of course they're
saying--they might be thinking

00:03:42.364 --> 00:03:43.889
like a lot of people in the
ancient world,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.871
there were other--lots of Jews
believed in the resurrection of

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.803
the body and so it was an idea
that was not unknown to people

00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:52.735
but think if the people in the
ancient world also objected by

00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:54.930
saying,
but how is that possible?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.550
We all know the body rots when
you put it in the ground,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.725
it just decomposes and it just
becomes all little molecules of

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:03.862
other things,
and how did--then that grows

00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:07.991
into trees and other grass,
the molecules from a dead body

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:09.908
become recycled in the universe.
 

00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:11.848
The ancient people knew this,
they would even say,

00:04:11.848 --> 00:04:15.508
what about sailors who were
lost at sea and fish eat their

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:17.588
bodies,
and then other fish eat those

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:19.750
bodies of those fish,
and then other fish eat those

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.833
bodies of those fish,
and then maybe one of those

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.050
fish gets caught and you
eat that body.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.317
You have some of the little
pieces of Fred the sailor in

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:31.002
your body, how is God going to
pull all that stuff together and

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:32.430
resurrect that body?
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.139
This was a debate that people
in the ancient world had too.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.019
Apparently some of the people
in Corinth are having this same

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:37.490
kind of idea.
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.600
How is this possible?
 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.420
Paul addresses that.
 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.910
Someone will ask,
"How the dead are raised?

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.360
With what kind of body do they
come?"

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.190
Fool!
 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.060
[that's just what it says]
what you sow does not come to

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.810
life unless it dies.
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.165
And as for what you sow,
you do not sow the body that is

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:02.264
to be but a bare seed,
perhaps of wheat or of some

00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:02.949
other grain.
 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.490
But God gives it a body as he
has chosen and to each kind of

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.689
seed its own body.
 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.480
[Just like a seed goes into the
ground,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.949
what comes up is a flower or
plant,

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.466
it doesn't look like the seed,
it's not even necessarily all

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.463
the same complete stuff,
its new stuff,

00:05:16.463 --> 00:05:18.512
but it's still continuous with
it.]

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:21.286
Not all flesh is alike,
but there is one flesh for

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:23.014
human beings,
another for animals,

00:05:23.014 --> 00:05:25.319
another for birds,
and another for fish.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.209
Now notice that's in kind of a
hierarchy there of beings.

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:32.870
Humans are higher than animals,
animals are higher than birds,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.721
birds are higher than fish on
this kind of ontological scale

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:38.720
of different kinds of bodies
that Paul is working with here.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.449
This is a common assumption in
the ancient world also.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.310
There are heavenly bodies and
earthly bodies.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.819
What are earthly bodies?
 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.882
Ours, this, dogs,
cats, everything's a body

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:52.269
that's physical for these
people.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:54.160
What are the heavenly bodies?
 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.660
The sun, the moon,
and the stars;

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.420
all these things are themselves
in ancient ideas bodies that

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.310
simply actually are fixed into a
kind of a dome that's the sky

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.860
and they travel around on that
dome.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.350
The earth--all these things in
the sky are also bodies.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.666
The glory of the heavenly is
one thing that of the earthly is

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:14.220
another.
 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.776
There is one glory for the sun,
another glory for the moon,

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.100
another glory for the stars.
 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.577
Indeed star differs from star
in glory [again,

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:24.668
a hierarchy of different kinds
of bodies]

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:28.300
so it is with the resurrection
of the dead.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.350
What is sown is perishable,
what is raised is imperishable.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.199
It is sown in dishonor,
it is raised in glory.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.069
It is sown in weakness,
it is raised in power.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.819
[Now here you get into a
translation problem.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.119
My translation here says in
verse 44:]

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:49.470
It is sown a physical body,
it is raised a spiritual body.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.185
Does anybody's translation have
something different at that

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:52.560
verse?
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.500
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.432
Prof: "It is sown a
natural body and it is raised in

00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:58.620
a spiritual body,"
is that what it says?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.720
Anybody else have a different
translation for those?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.692
The problem is the word
translated "physical"

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.829
here is not really the Greek
word "physical".

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.310
There is a Greek word
"physical."

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.617
What they're talking about here
is what is sown is as psychic--a

00:07:14.617 --> 00:07:17.762
body made of psuchos,
the Greek word for

00:07:17.762 --> 00:07:19.199
"soul."
 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.911
What is sown as a "soulish
body" is what he's talking

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:23.389
about.
 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.959
It's a heavy--it's a denser
kind of body,

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:28.480
and what is raised is a
spiritual body,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.675
but whereas in the modern
world, we tend to think

00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:32.689
spiritual is something that's
immaterial,

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.629
spiritual means not matter,
it's invisible,

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:37.329
it's something that doesn't
exist as matter.

00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:40.139
That's not what pneuma
means in the ancient world.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:42.134
In the ancient world
pneuma is like--is a

00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:43.959
stuff, it's like what air is
made out of.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:47.060
When the wind blows around
that's pneuma,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.291
when you take in breath you're
taking in a form of

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.480
pneuma.
 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.672
That Greek word pneuma
does refer in the ancient world

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:55.949
to some kind of stuff.
 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:59.785
It doesn't refer to immaterial
substance as it does later in

00:07:59.785 --> 00:08:02.709
Christian theology or in some
philosophies.

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:05.992
The translation here is
misleading because what Paul

00:08:05.992 --> 00:08:08.238
says is,
when your body is put into the

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.627
ground,
when you're dead,

00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:12.250
what's put in there is sort of
a psychic body,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.009
it's a body that carries life,
sure,

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:15.620
because that's what psychic
means for--

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.341
in the ancient Greek world,
it's a living body but it is

00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.759
more like something--
it's a natural body.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.509
It's kind of the body that
you're just given naturally.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:26.192
When it's raised it's going to
be raised to say a pneumatic

00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:28.639
body,
but now a pneumatic body--so

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:32.379
it's not the same thing as it
was put in the ground,

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:36.553
it's raised a pneumatic body
but it's still some kind of

00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:37.158
stuff.
 

00:08:37.158 --> 00:08:39.743
If there is a physical body
there is also a spiritual body,

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:40.590
a pneumatic body.
 

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.202
Thus it is written,
"The first man,

00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:43.690
Adam, became a living
being";

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.730
the last Adam became a
life-giving pneuma.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.255
But it is not the pneuma
that is first but the

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:53.240
psychic and then the
pneuma.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.820
The first man was from the
earth, a man of dust;

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.759
the second man is from heaven.
 

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:00.565
Notice that he talked about
heavenly bodies earlier,

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:03.700
and he says the resurrected
body is going to be a heavenly

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.470
body also.
 

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.471
This indicates that in a lot of
ancient thought they thought

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.793
that the sun,
and the moon,

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:11.389
and the stars were themselves
pneumatic bodies.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.379
They were bodies made of the
stuff of pneuma.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:17.490
As was the man of dust,
so are those from the dust;

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.058
as was the man of heaven,
so are those from heaven.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.298
Just as we are born in the
image of the man of dust,

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:23.538
we will also bear the image of
the man of heaven.

00:09:23.538 --> 00:09:25.802
What I am saying,
brothers, is this:

00:09:25.802 --> 00:09:28.971
flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God,

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:32.399
nor does the perishable inherit
the imperishable.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:35.399
"Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.120
God."
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.875
Notice that what he is saying
is that the resurrected body

00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:43.370
that he is expecting is not a
flesh and blood body.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.643
When Paul's thinking about
however the resurrection of

00:09:47.643 --> 00:09:51.191
Christ happened,
he doesn't imagine it as the

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.610
very same flesh and blood.
 

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.458
It's not like it is in the
movies, where the very same

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.577
flesh and blood of the dead
Jesus body somehow resuscitates

00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.190
and walks out of the tomb.
 

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.711
That's how people popularly
imagine it, and that's how

00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:05.899
clearly some early Christians
thought of it.

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:08.884
Some early Christians thought
precisely that it was the flesh

00:10:08.884 --> 00:10:12.120
and blood body of Jesus that got
up and walked out of the tomb.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.269
Paul must not have thought that
because he says,

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:16.908
the body that we will as
Christians,

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.442
as followers of Christ,
have when we are resurrected is

00:10:19.442 --> 00:10:21.980
a pneumatic body,
not a flesh and blood body.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.153
It's still a physical body in
Paul's sense,

00:10:24.153 --> 00:10:26.431
but he believes that
pneuma is matter,

00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:29.019
so what will be raised is this
pneumatic body.

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:32.149
Why is Paul getting into all
this?

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:33.922
For one thing it shows,
like I said,

00:10:33.922 --> 00:10:36.909
this is a church that's not a
totally infant church but it's

00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:38.428
also an adolescent church.
 

00:10:38.428 --> 00:10:44.129
These are people who have much
more exposure to Paul's teaching

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:47.340
and to the Gospel,
and different Christian ideas

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.495
than,
say, the Thessalonian

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:49.139
Christians did.
 

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:52.788
But they're still very confused
about a lot of things that Paul

00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:54.788
seems to be quite certain about.
 

00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:56.928
Apparently some of these people
in this church,

00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:59.166
they had heard this teaching
about the resurrection of the

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:00.794
body,
so apparently they have heard

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.428
this already.
 

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:03.606
They're not like the
Thessalonians who just don't

00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:05.965
seem to know that anything's
going to happen to their

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.460
brothers and sisters after their
death so they're--

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.717
Paul has to say no,
no, no, no the dead in Christ

00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:12.475
will rise,
we'll go meet Jesus in the air,

00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:14.741
there will be a big party,
and if they're dead now they

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.019
won't miss out on the party.
 

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:17.798
The Corinthians don't have that
problem.

00:11:17.798 --> 00:11:20.168
They know that there's some
kind of afterlife preaching and

00:11:20.168 --> 00:11:22.232
teaching,
but some of them seem to be

00:11:22.232 --> 00:11:25.495
rejecting the most obvious crude
way of understanding the

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:28.700
resurrection of the body:
as if the very flesh and blood

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.730
will somehow resuscitate and
come back to life.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.683
And so Paul says no,
no that's not how it happens,

00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:35.038
it's more complicated than
that.

00:11:35.038 --> 00:11:37.783
There is a spiritual body and
then there's this natural body,

00:11:37.783 --> 00:11:40.620
and the spiritual body is the
one that's going to be raised.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.240
Now it's perfectly natural,
though,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.379
for people to have raised these
objections,

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:48.297
precisely because if they heard
Paul's preaching about the

00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:51.336
resurrection of the body,
they precisely would think,

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.240
well now how would that happen?
 

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.341
They would skeptical of it,
especially if they had any kind

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.590
of sort of more philosophical
education.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.937
They would think that's
superstition,

00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:04.261
the idea that body's
can--zombies can kind of get up

00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:08.110
of the grave and walk around,
that's just superstition.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.798
Simple people might believe
that, but we're more educated;

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:12.928
we don't believe that kind of
stuff.

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:15.571
This shows that this church is
in a bit of a different

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.168
situation.
 

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:19.407
There's going to be some cosmic
transformation that will happen

00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:22.750
at the end of time and this is
not an individual thing either.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.019
It's not like every individual
person sort of experiences your

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:29.236
afterlife experience and your
resurrection all at a different

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:29.720
time.
 

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.149
It's all the same time.
 

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:34.850
Paul seems to imagine that
people will sleep in the ground,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.820
and then, at the end of time,
the Messiah will come back,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.149
and this big resurrection of
pneumatic bodies will occur.

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:46.226
Notice though that this is the
issue he relates in just 1

00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:48.922
Corinthians 15,
and we're going to back up then

00:12:48.922 --> 00:12:50.945
and talk about how does that
issue about the resurrection of

00:12:50.945 --> 00:12:52.899
the body relate to other parts
of the letter and how--

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:54.658
what does that tell us about
this church.

00:12:54.658 --> 00:12:56.788
First a little background on
what this is.

00:12:56.788 --> 00:13:00.298
Corinth is a very important
city in the ancient Greek world.

00:13:00.298 --> 00:13:03.418
It's right on the isthmus of
Corinth,

00:13:03.418 --> 00:13:07.307
that little narrow strip of
land that connects the main part

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.799
of Greece where Athens is,
Achaea, to the southern part of

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:13.399
Greece called the Peloponnese or
the Peloponnesus.

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:18.320
It was an important throughway,
both by land,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.966
because all trade and travel
that went from northern Greece

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.821
to southern Greece,
or vice versa,

00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:26.412
had to go right through Corinth
so it was very important for

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:26.960
trade.
 

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.470
It was also,
though, where they didn't--

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.760
they have a canal there now so
that you don't have to sail

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.288
around the southern part of
Greece,

00:13:33.288 --> 00:13:35.720
you can just go through the
canal, but back then they didn't

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.149
have a canal so they had these
big tracks and so ships would

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:41.129
come up on Cenchrea,
one part on one side of Greece

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:43.730
and they would unload all their
stuff,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.245
put them on these big tracks,
and they would take it across

00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:48.460
the isthmus and then load it
back on other ships.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.480
So this is a hugely important
city as far as trade went.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.798
It was also important for Rome.
 

00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:56.582
Rome had destroyed Corinth
previously in the 140s BCE

00:13:56.582 --> 00:13:59.634
because Corinth was helping to
lead rebellions against the

00:13:59.634 --> 00:14:03.058
Romans who were increasing their
power in the eastern part of the

00:14:03.058 --> 00:14:04.129
Mediterranean.
 

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:07.610
The Romans destroyed Corinth
and then left if that way for

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.710
about 100 years.
 

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:13.809
It had been refounded again in
the 40s and then settled with

00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:15.278
Roman veterans.
 

00:14:15.278 --> 00:14:19.642
By the time that Paul writes
this letter, in say the middle

00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:23.477
of the first century CE,
our era, Corinth is still a

00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:25.960
very Romanized kind of place.
 

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.734
So it's got a blend of Greek
cultures and a blend of Roman

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:29.269
cultures.
 

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:33.414
In fact, the inscriptions in
Corinth up until the year 130 or

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:36.940
so were still predominantly in
Latin in Corinth,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.750
which was very unusual in the
ancient world,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.519
but it shows that the Romans
and Latin was very important.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:45.942
Corinth was a Roman colony
which made it both a Greek place

00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:47.360
and a Romanized place.
 

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.038
Paul founded the church there
himself,

00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:53.875
it talks about it in Acts
18:1-18, and in this case we

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:58.506
don't have a whole lot of way to
dispute a lot of what Acts tells

00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:01.972
us about Corinth,
although we can't take it as

00:15:01.972 --> 00:15:04.450
straightforward historically
either.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.490
Paul writes his letter to the
Corinthians from Ephesus,

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.009
as he says in chapter 16.
 

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:15.143
And Paul has gotten his
information about what's going

00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:18.750
on at the church in Corinth from
several different sources.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.450
We're going to flip around a
bit.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.320
Look at 1 Corinthians 1:11:
 

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.293
For it has been reported to me
by Chloe's people that there are

00:15:37.293 --> 00:15:38.889
quarrels among you.
 

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:40.432
Some people say,
"I belong to Paul,"

00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:41.596
or "I belong to
Apollos,"

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:42.727
or "I belong to
Cephas,"

00:15:42.727 --> 00:15:44.100
or "I belong to
Christ."

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.590
Chloe's people,
what does that mean?

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.220
Well Chloe's obviously a
woman's name,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.178
and when you hear this in
Greek, somebody's people,

00:15:51.178 --> 00:15:55.509
those--it has to be those
around Chloe,

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:58.250
this refers to probably members
of her own household.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.240
They could be slaves,
they could be her freed

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.535
persons,
they could be clients,

00:16:03.535 --> 00:16:06.490
it probably refers to clients
or slaves,

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.678
or freed men of Chloe of
herself.

00:16:08.678 --> 00:16:11.658
They're members of this
church--now it doesn't tell us

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:14.298
that Chloe herself is a member
of the church.

00:16:14.298 --> 00:16:17.200
She might be because Paul names
her out by name,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.986
but we don't know that for
sure, but at least some of the

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:23.049
members of her household are,
and they have gone to Paul and

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.620
told him stuff that's going on.
 

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.232
He gets some of his information
from Chloe's people,

00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:29.486
and, like I said,
those may well be slaves or

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:30.409
freed persons.
 

00:16:30.409 --> 00:16:31.960
Is that important?
 

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.288
Well at least it means they're
probably not members of the

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:39.100
upper class or high status
members.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.610
He also gets information from a
letter,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.835
so in 7:1 he says,
"Now concerning the

00:16:44.835 --> 00:16:49.289
matters about which you wrote:
'it is well for a man not to

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:53.283
touch a woman.'"
Then he gets into the issues of

00:16:53.283 --> 00:16:55.577
sexuality,
marriage, divorce,

00:16:55.577 --> 00:16:57.058
and those kinds of things.
 

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.701
He's also, though,
received a letter that--from at

00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:02.990
least other people in Corinth
that raises different issues.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.200
What do we do about divorce?
 

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.180
What do we do about marriage?
 

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.630
What do we do about sex?
 

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.269
So from chapter 7 on he raises
different issues that may have

00:17:10.269 --> 00:17:14.028
been raised in their letter to
him, so that's one place he gets

00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:15.000
information.
 

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.255
He also mentions in 16:12 that
Apollos has come and is with him

00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:22.548
in Ephesus, and Apollos has come
from Corinth.

00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:25.200
So he probably gets some
information from Apollos,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.538
who is not--Paul talks about
Apollos as a coworker,

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:31.460
not as his sort of servant,
or his assistant,

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.509
or anything like that.
 

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:35.344
In fact, when Paul talks about
Timothy it's clear that Timothy

00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:37.250
is Paul's assistant because Paul
says,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.740
"I sent Timothy"
someplace,

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.930
but when he talks about Apollos
he says,

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.680
"I have urged Apollos to
go,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.009
to come visit you."
 

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:47.101
In other words,
Paul doesn't say he sent

00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:48.118
Apollos anywhere.
 

00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:51.323
This indicates that Apollos is
on something more of an equal

00:17:51.323 --> 00:17:53.778
status with Paul,
maybe Apollos is considered

00:17:53.778 --> 00:17:55.248
another Apostle,
or a teacher,

00:17:55.248 --> 00:17:57.140
or something like that in the
early church.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.500
Paul may have gotten some of
the information there.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:07.038
Then in 16:17 he talks about,
"I rejoice at the coming

00:18:07.038 --> 00:18:11.741
of Stephanas and Fortunatus,
and Achaicus,

00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:14.328
because they have made up for
your absence."

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:17.708
Now there are a couple of
interesting things about these

00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:18.200
names.
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.146
Achaicus would mean--would be
sort of a name or a nickname for

00:18:22.146 --> 00:18:26.029
someone who's from Achaea,
the area just north of Corinth;

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:27.660
that means that area of Greece.
 

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.680
Stephanas is a very Greek word
meaning "a crown,"

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.920
and Fortunatus,
though, is not a Greek word,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.170
it's from the Latin.
 

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.854
Fortunatus means
"fortune,"

00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:40.806
someone who's fortunate or
lucky, like having a person

00:18:40.806 --> 00:18:42.000
named Lucky.
 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.788
Does this mean that this guy
was himself Roman or maybe was a

00:18:46.788 --> 00:18:51.420
freed person of a Roman,
therefore had a Latinized name?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.926
We don't know about that,
but Paul apparently has gotten

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:56.526
information from them also,
and he talks about a church in

00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:57.210
that house.
 

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.576
What's going on in Corinth is
there seem to be different house

00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:01.788
churches in Corinth.
 

00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:04.838
It's not all one group meeting
all the time in one place.

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:07.599
We can imagine different house
churches meeting in different

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:10.220
places and maybe made up of
different kinds of people.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.685
One of the ways we're going to
talk about this is to see what

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.940
was the social class of these
people.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:21.278
In 1 Corinthians 1:26 we get
our first major clue,

00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:24.065
"Consider your own call
brothers and sisters not many of

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.758
you," again the Greek
doesn't have "sisters"

00:19:26.758 --> 00:19:29.588
they've added into the English
to make it more inclusive.

00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:32.291
"Not many of you were wise
by human standards,

00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:34.724
not many were powerful,
not many were of noble

00:19:34.724 --> 00:19:35.588
birth."
 

00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:39.271
Now all three of those words in
the Greek are status symbol

00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:39.779
words.
 

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.695
"Wise"
doesn't mean just smart,

00:19:41.695 --> 00:19:43.230
it means "educated."
 

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.490
Not many of you are well
educated, not many of you are

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.667
powerful,
that is you're not people

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:52.233
occupying government positions
or anything like that and you're

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.500
not of noble birth.
 

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.160
But God chose what is foolish
in the world to shame the wise.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.808
God chose what is weak in the
world to shame the strong.

00:19:59.808 --> 00:20:02.190
God chose what is low and
despised in the world,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.570
things that are not,
to reduce to nothing things

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.230
that are.
 

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.613
Now at one point those verses
were taken to indicate that all

00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:11.940
of the Corinthian church were
just completely low class,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.990
that they were all either
slaves, or poor freed men,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.019
or lower class manual laborers.
 

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:19.728
This kind of went along with
the image that you saw a lot

00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:22.679
about Christianity in popular
movies like "Ben Hur,"

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:25.242
or "The Robe,"
or things like this which has

00:20:25.242 --> 00:20:28.241
the earliest Christians all kind
of hiding away from the Romans

00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:31.047
in little dark rooms and all
being very much laboring class

00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:31.868
people.
 

00:20:31.868 --> 00:20:34.502
More recently scholars have
said, yeah but that's not

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:37.087
exactly what Paul says,
he says "not many of

00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:40.430
you" were these things,
which at least implies that

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.338
some people in the Corinthian
church actually were wise,

00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:47.438
maybe educated,
of noble birth or having some

00:20:47.438 --> 00:20:49.269
kind of access to power.
 

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:53.808
This is one clue that's caused
scholars in the last thirty,

00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:56.868
forty years to reread the
Corinthian correspondence,

00:20:56.868 --> 00:20:58.769
both 1 Corinthians and 2
Corinthians,

00:20:58.769 --> 00:21:03.130
precisely by looking at what's
going on with regard to social

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.019
status and social class.
 

00:21:05.019 --> 00:21:08.590
And now it gets really
interesting because the typical

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.701
way to read the Bible that most
of us grew up with is you read

00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:14.048
it very piously.
 

00:21:14.048 --> 00:21:16.058
You read it as having something
to say about theology,

00:21:16.058 --> 00:21:17.980
you read it as having something
to say about God,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.385
and all those are obviously
important ways to read the

00:21:20.385 --> 00:21:20.750
Bible.
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.740
It's also when you add in
issues like,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.893
might this text not only have
something to say about theology

00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:29.680
but also about issues like
social class and power,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.538
and scholars have said it's
precisely in 1 Corinthians,

00:21:33.538 --> 00:21:35.618
it's one of the places we see
in the New Testament,

00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:39.178
the best evidence we have that
the early churches weren't all

00:21:39.178 --> 00:21:42.557
homogeneous when it comes to
their social status level and

00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:45.642
they may have actually
experienced conflicts in their

00:21:45.642 --> 00:21:48.904
groups due precisely to
differences in social status and

00:21:48.904 --> 00:21:50.150
social power.
 

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.940
That's the way I have
interpreted 1 Corinthians,

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.894
and it's debated by some
people, but it's much more the

00:21:57.894 --> 00:22:00.970
consensus view now among
scholars that--

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.845
especially the Corinthian
correspondence does have these

00:22:03.845 --> 00:22:05.308
evidences of class levels.
 

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:07.368
Let's see, how is this working
out,

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:11.700
I just read the first passage
where Paul seems to say,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.519
some of you are claiming I'm
for Paul,

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:15.759
I'm one of Paul's people,
I'm one of Apollos' people,

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:19.681
I'm one of the Cephas' people,
and of course Cephas is just

00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:22.519
the Aramaic name for Peter,
exactly.

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:25.287
Peter is the Greek name,
Cephas is the Aramaic name for

00:22:25.287 --> 00:22:27.848
"the rock,"
and some people in the church

00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:30.828
are saying,
I'm one of Christ's men.

00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:35.119
There are parties that seem to
have been developed or at least

00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:39.130
there are some kind of glomming
onto different leaders.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.878
Some people have said these may
actually represent four

00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:46.420
different specific delineable
parties in Corinth.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.060
I tend to doubt that because I
don't think you see any evidence

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.404
the rest of the way in the
correspondence that there are

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:52.470
four distinct groups.
 

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.011
I do think there are basically
two groups that are going on in

00:22:56.011 --> 00:22:59.438
opposition to one another in
Corinth and that's what I build

00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:00.890
my reconstruction on.
 

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.278
People are having their
favorite Apostles,

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:07.900
what are some of the other--the
resurrection of the body is one

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.345
thing but there are several
other issues and now that you've

00:23:11.345 --> 00:23:14.499
all read 1 Corinthians so
carefully in the last several

00:23:14.499 --> 00:23:16.848
days,
and read it over I'm sure three

00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:19.917
or four times each day,
you yourselves can tell me what

00:23:19.917 --> 00:23:23.338
are some of the other issues
that come out in 1 Corinthians.

00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:29.880
First, we have favorite
Apostles and we have differences

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.279
about the resurrection of the
body.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.826
Those are two of the issues
that Paul has to address in 1

00:23:41.826 --> 00:23:44.250
Corinthians, what are some of
the others?

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.470
Anybody?
 

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.200
Student: 
&gt;

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.340
Prof: Okay,
sexual conduct,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.960
and what kinds?
 

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.839
because there are actually
several different issues on

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:57.578
sexual conduct in Corinthians.
 

00:23:57.578 --> 00:24:00.630
Student: 
&gt;

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:06.020
Prof: Exactly,
a man is sleeping with his

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.068
stepmother and Paul says that's
a big no, no,

00:24:11.068 --> 00:24:16.236
even for the Greeks he says;
even the Greeks don't do that

00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:17.009
kind of stuff.
 

00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:21.528
What other sexual conduct
issues are going on?

00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:25.250
How about chapter 6 in
Corinthians--1 Corinthians?

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.470
Some men in a church are
visiting prostitutes,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.759
what it means in 1 Corinthians
6 when it says,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.996
"Do you not know that
whoever is united to a

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:54.182
prostitute becomes one body with
her," so some men in the

00:24:54.182 --> 00:24:56.997
church seem to think,
well what's the big deal,

00:24:56.997 --> 00:24:58.990
I'm in Christ,
I'm a Christian?

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.288
But what you do with your body
is not that important,

00:25:01.288 --> 00:25:05.325
so every guy's got needs,
so some of these Christian men

00:25:05.325 --> 00:25:08.522
are visiting prostitutes,
and Paul has to address that

00:25:08.522 --> 00:25:08.808
issue.
 

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:12.902
Any other issues of sexuality
that Paul has to address in 1

00:25:12.902 --> 00:25:13.890
Corinthians?
 

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.210
There's one more major one.
 

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:16.940
Student: 
&gt;

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.259
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:19.298
Student: 
&gt;

00:25:19.298 --> 00:25:20.211
Prof: Virginity.
 

00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:22.594
He does bring it up but that's
not as big an issue for him as

00:25:22.594 --> 00:25:24.380
simply the idea of should you
get married.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.500
Remember in 1 Corinthians 7:1
they seem to have asked him,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.394
this is actually put into
quotation marks in some of your

00:25:31.394 --> 00:25:34.595
Bibles,
"It is good for a man not

00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:36.598
to touch a woman."
 

00:25:36.598 --> 00:25:39.483
Now scholars debate,
is that Paul's view or is that

00:25:39.483 --> 00:25:42.829
a quotation of a slogan of
theirs that he's quoting back to

00:25:42.829 --> 00:25:43.348
them?
 

00:25:43.348 --> 00:25:45.269
So there's a debate about that
among some scholars,

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:48.006
but at least some people in
Corinth have written him asking

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:50.788
particularly about should we
have sex at all or should we be

00:25:50.788 --> 00:25:55.339
totally ascetic,
that is avoid sex and be

00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:58.160
totally continent.
 

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:05.589
Sex and asceticism,
which leads to also issues of

00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:13.486
marriage and divorce,
so what other issues are going

00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:14.568
on?
 

00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:18.480
What about the first part of 1
Corinthians 6?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.263
"When any of you has a
grievance against one another do

00:26:21.263 --> 00:26:24.095
you dare to take it to a court
before the unrighteous instead

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:26.028
of taking it before the
saints?"

00:26:26.028 --> 00:26:29.939
Now notice this is the part in
1 Corinthians that's before Paul

00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:32.933
mentions the letter,
so this seems to be part of the

00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:35.553
information he's gotten,
maybe from Chloe's people,

00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:38.150
that some people in the
Corinthian church are taking

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.950
other members of the church to
court and suing them;

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:48.019
so court cases is one issue.
 

00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:50.691
Right after that it's the one
about the prostitutes,

00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:52.838
then marriage and divorce in
chapter 7.

00:26:52.838 --> 00:26:58.467
And then chapters 8-11 are all
about one big complex issue,

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:01.960
and that is food offered to
idols.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.680
Now why is that a problem?
 

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.750
Well in the ancient world most
of the time--

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.868
I'll talk about this a little
bit further,

00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:17.078
most of the time meat was
expensive,

00:27:17.078 --> 00:27:19.490
and if you were not rich it was
hard to come by.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.737
The one place where most people
in the ancient world actually

00:27:22.737 --> 00:27:25.930
had any chance to eat meat was
in a sacrificial festival.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.587
What would happen in Greek
sacrifices is that somebody

00:27:28.587 --> 00:27:29.654
rich,
or the city,

00:27:29.654 --> 00:27:31.538
would pay for a bunch of
cattle,

00:27:31.538 --> 00:27:34.380
or different kinds of animals,
to all be slaughtered,

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.342
the blood would be poured out
and part of the animals would be

00:27:37.342 --> 00:27:39.430
put on an altar and burned for
the gods,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.160
but all the rest of the meat
would then be passed out,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.358
and different people who went
to the festival would eat it.

00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:48.332
You would go with your buds and
you would get a big hunk of meat

00:27:48.332 --> 00:27:50.859
from the sacrifice,
then you'd go off and barbeque

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:53.692
it, and have your own barbeque
as part of this sacrificial

00:27:53.692 --> 00:27:55.898
festival;
or you'd take it back to your

00:27:55.898 --> 00:27:58.008
family, store some it,
boil some of it,

00:27:58.008 --> 00:27:59.230
that sort of thing.
 

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.375
So the main place that most
people in the ancient world ate

00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:05.576
meat was connected to some kind
of sacrifice to some kind of

00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:06.009
god.
 

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:09.041
Now of course this is part of
the sacrificial cult,

00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:12.681
you're eating--you're sharing a
table with that god by eating

00:28:12.681 --> 00:28:14.440
that sacrificed material.
 

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.876
It's like you're sitting down
to dinner with Zeus when you do

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:18.680
this, right?
 

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.924
If you're a Jew in the ancient
world this causes problems

00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:24.940
because it means you don't
believe in these gods,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.308
you're supposed to avoid these
gods,

00:28:26.308 --> 00:28:29.263
you're supposed to avoid
idolatry, but if you eat that

00:28:29.263 --> 00:28:32.775
meat you're seen by many Jews as
participating in that cult with

00:28:32.775 --> 00:28:33.500
that god.
 

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.192
Also, some people believed,
some of the people thought this

00:28:36.192 --> 00:28:39.153
was kind of superstitious,
that if you ate that stuff then

00:28:39.153 --> 00:28:42.119
whatever the power that lie
behind that god could get into

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:43.890
your body by means of the food.
 

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.450
You can imagine how this
happened.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.661
A lot of Jews believed
that--they didn't believe that

00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:51.500
the idols were just nothing but
stone, or rock,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.858
or wood, or metal.
 

00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:55.086
They believed there was
something there that was causing

00:28:55.086 --> 00:28:56.790
that thing to have power,
because they looked around and

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.415
they said,
this person claimed to be

00:28:58.415 --> 00:28:59.588
healed by Asclepius.
 

00:28:59.588 --> 00:29:02.700
Well I can see he's now healed,
so who healed him?

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.980
I don't believe that Asclepius
is actually a god,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.740
but I believe Asclepius is a
demon.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.801
So a lot of Jews would go
around--and Christians later

00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:12.020
saying--
that the powers that lie behind

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.196
the gods of other nations are
not really gods but they may be

00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:17.102
demons,
and if you participated in

00:29:17.102 --> 00:29:20.920
eating their meat,
that demon could get in your

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.519
body.
 

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:26.259
Food offered to idols became a
big problem in the early church.

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:27.390
Should you eat it?
 

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.130
If so, would it hurt you?
 

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.490
Did it mean you were
participating in sacrifice?

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:39.823
In chapter 11 another issue:
women praying without veiling

00:29:39.823 --> 00:29:41.869
their heads;
 

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.568
Paul has to address that.
 

00:29:48.568 --> 00:29:51.250
Notice he doesn't say that
women can't pray in church,

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.029
but he says,
if they are going to pray in

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:55.744
church they need to put a veil
over their heads because of the

00:29:55.744 --> 00:29:58.568
angels,
whatever that means.

00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:01.652
There's been a lot of us who've
written a lot on that,

00:30:01.652 --> 00:30:04.965
and I have my own theories,
which most of my friends don't

00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:05.490
like.
 

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.271
In chapter 11 later he gets
into a big conversation about

00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:11.352
what they're supposed to do in
The Lord's Supper when they come

00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:13.288
together to eat the Lord's
Supper,

00:30:13.288 --> 00:30:15.380
and it's not turning out the
way it's supposed to be,

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:21.848
so that's another issue,
the Lord's Supper.

00:30:21.848 --> 00:30:26.099
In chapters 12-14,
nobody raised this issue,

00:30:26.099 --> 00:30:31.931
chapters 12-14 what's the big
issue that Paul has to address

00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:32.920
there?
 

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.348
Student: 
&gt;

00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:36.838
Prof: Speaking in
tongues,

00:30:36.838 --> 00:30:39.412
so the technical term for that
is often glossolalia,

00:30:39.412 --> 00:30:41.852
which comes from the Greek word
for "tongues,"

00:30:41.852 --> 00:30:43.048
so speaking in tongues.
 

00:30:43.048 --> 00:30:46.160
Some people in the church are
speaking in tongues.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.684
Speaking in tongues of course
just refers to speaking some

00:30:49.684 --> 00:30:53.147
kind of unknown esoteric
language that you'd only know by

00:30:53.147 --> 00:30:55.190
miracle, it's a special gift.
 

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.660
It's not a language you learn.
 

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.082
There's a debate among people
about when people talk about

00:30:59.082 --> 00:31:01.446
speaking in tongues,
are they talking about speaking

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:05.084
some other human language,
which is known but not learned

00:31:05.084 --> 00:31:05.720
by you?
 

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.519
That's what it sounds like in
Acts.

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.470
In Acts the tongues of fire
come down upon the Apostles,

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.528
and they all start speaking
these strange languages,

00:31:13.528 --> 00:31:16.022
and it says everybody who was
there visiting from around the

00:31:16.022 --> 00:31:18.390
world could understand the
Apostles speaking in their own

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:18.940
language.
 

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.814
So the writer of Acts seems to
think that speaking in tongues

00:31:21.814 --> 00:31:24.689
in the early church refers to
this speaking other known human

00:31:24.689 --> 00:31:25.358
languages.
 

00:31:25.358 --> 00:31:28.355
Other scholars think that at
other times it referred to just

00:31:28.355 --> 00:31:31.248
speaking some kind of unknown
language that would sound to

00:31:31.248 --> 00:31:34.431
anybody like gibberish,
and that's often how it happens

00:31:34.431 --> 00:31:35.000
nowadays.
 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.291
If you go to a church where
they're speaking in tongues,

00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:39.710
they're not speaking another
discernible human language.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.838
They're speaking something else.
 

00:31:40.838 --> 00:31:42.296
Paul calls it,
at one point,

00:31:42.296 --> 00:31:44.753
the language of angels,
so some of these early

00:31:44.753 --> 00:31:47.628
Christians seem to think that
when they spoke in tongues they

00:31:47.628 --> 00:31:50.313
were speaking the angelic
language and they were learning

00:31:50.313 --> 00:31:51.318
it miraculously.
 

00:31:51.318 --> 00:31:55.330
So speaking in tongues is an
issue, and Paul addresses that

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.960
in those chapters,
in 12 through 14.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.827
Then as we said,
the last major issue is the

00:31:59.827 --> 00:32:01.000
resurrection of the body.
 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.298
Now what holds these different
issues together?

00:32:07.298 --> 00:32:11.906
Are these just random sorts of
things that are splitting the

00:32:11.906 --> 00:32:12.608
church?
 

00:32:12.608 --> 00:32:16.169
Is it just because some people
like speaking in tongues and

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:17.088
others don't?
 

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:20.978
Some people are doing it and
others don't,

00:32:20.978 --> 00:32:26.288
is it just because the court
cases, it's just an isolated

00:32:26.288 --> 00:32:28.848
incident here or there?
 

00:32:28.848 --> 00:32:32.558
Is the issue of food offered to
idols,

00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:35.166
and their debate about that,
is that at all connected to

00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:37.868
their disagreements about the
resurrection of the body?

00:32:37.868 --> 00:32:41.000
Are those connected to their
disagreements about sexual

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.578
conduct?
 

00:32:41.578 --> 00:32:43.824
Because obviously they're
disagreeing about this,

00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:46.630
this is why Paul is getting
different reports from people.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.131
He's getting some reports from
Chloe's people and then some

00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:51.496
others write a letter,
and whoever wrote the letter is

00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:53.820
probably not the same people
that are giving him the oral

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.058
reports,
so Paul's getting information

00:32:56.058 --> 00:32:58.460
from different factions in this
church.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.818
The big question is:
do all of these issues just

00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:05.963
represent totally different
disparate arguments or is there

00:33:05.963 --> 00:33:10.181
some bigger reason that these
are a debate and is there some

00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:14.470
sort of major divide along which
people are lining up?

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:19.704
You get a really wonderful
brilliant book written by a

00:33:19.704 --> 00:33:25.038
famous New Testament scholar,
moi, called The

00:33:25.038 --> 00:33:27.410
Corinthian Body.
 

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.748
What I tried to do in that book
was precisely to take all of

00:33:30.748 --> 00:33:34.313
these different issues and show
how they could line up on one or

00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:37.029
two sides of what was a social
status issue.

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:40.701
I argued that--it wouldn't be
totally neatly but I tried to

00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:44.626
say is that in a bunch of these
different issues if you you had

00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:47.463
more money,
if you had more access to

00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:50.308
power, if you had a better
education,

00:33:50.308 --> 00:33:53.380
likely you would end up on one
side of these issues.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.147
If you didn't have money,
you didn't have power,

00:33:56.147 --> 00:33:59.740
and you didn't have education,
you were more likely to line up

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.980
on the other side of these
issues.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.470
I argued that the Corinthian
church,

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.488
which, remember,
was in different house

00:34:05.488 --> 00:34:07.061
churches,
and it may have been that one

00:34:07.061 --> 00:34:08.789
house church tended to be on one
side,

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:10.789
and another house church tended
to be on another,

00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:11.590
we don't know that.
 

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.007
We know that there were
different house churches being

00:34:14.007 --> 00:34:16.059
represented here in the church
in Corinth,

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.101
so when we talk about the
church in Corinth we're not just

00:34:18.101 --> 00:34:20.041
talking about one house church,
we're talking about the

00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:21.947
collection of them,
and apparently they may have

00:34:21.947 --> 00:34:24.579
all gotten together sometimes
for a special sort of festival

00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:27.349
for the Lord's Supper at times,
but they apparently would have

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:29.889
been meeting in other people's
houses at other kinds of times.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.369
Let's look at how this would
work.

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:35.050
First, the whole Lord's Supper
issue,

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.059
and here is something that I
didn't write about on my own,

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:41.210
this was by a famous scholar
named Gerd Theissen,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.190
a German scholar.
 

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.061
He published a series of
articles in the 70's and 80's in

00:34:45.061 --> 00:34:46.599
which he made this argument.
 

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:48.389
He pointed out just like I
already have,

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.590
that meat--the availability of
meat in the ancient world was

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.440
very much linked to sacrificial
cult,

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.969
the argument I just gave you.
 

00:34:57.969 --> 00:35:01.126
Even if you weren't going to
participate in the sacrifice

00:35:01.126 --> 00:35:03.378
itself,
chances are if you went to a

00:35:03.378 --> 00:35:05.670
butcher shop and wanted to buy
meat,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.179
and it would be expensive if it
was meat at all,

00:35:08.179 --> 00:35:11.960
the chances are that butcher
had gotten that meat from some

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.675
kind of sacrificial activity
because the priests sometimes

00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:18.789
would own the meat--
sometimes in order to make

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:22.369
money for themselves they would
sell meat to butcher shops.

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:24.934
It would be almost impossible,
it would be very difficult

00:35:24.934 --> 00:35:27.681
unless you yourself were wealthy
and you could raise your own

00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:29.597
meat,
have it slaughtered your way,

00:35:29.597 --> 00:35:32.563
and consume it yourself and
know that it wasn't connected to

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:35.043
the sacrifices at all,
but if you weren't wealthy and

00:35:35.043 --> 00:35:36.650
couldn't raise your own meat
like that,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:41.242
and you just depended upon
festivals or the butcher shop it

00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:45.518
would be very difficult to avoid
meat that had not been

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:47.420
sacrificed to idols.
 

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.110
So he argued about that.
 

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.000
He also pointed out that the
Lord's Supper,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.159
when we look at the Lord's
Supper, notice what is

00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:53.789
happening.
 

00:35:53.789 --> 00:36:08.190
This is in 1 Corinthians
chapter 11.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:14.313
Start reading at chapter 11:17:
Now in the following

00:36:14.313 --> 00:36:17.242
instructions I do not commend
you, because when you come

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:20.170
together it is not for the
better but for the worse.

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.231
For, to begin with,
when you come together as a

00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:24.425
church, I hear that there are
divisions among you,

00:36:24.425 --> 00:36:26.039
and to some extent I believe
it.

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:28.210
Indeed, there have to be
factions among you,

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.289
for only so will it become
clear who among you are genuine.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:34.175
[I think he's being ironic
there but it could be a debate.]

00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:36.961
When you come together it is
not really to eat the Lord's

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:37.510
Supper.
 

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.920
For when the time comes to eat,
each of you goes ahead with

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.416
your own supper,
and one goes hungry,

00:36:41.416 --> 00:36:42.539
and another goes drunk.
 

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:43.320
What!
 

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.802
Do you not have homes to eat
and drink in,

00:36:45.802 --> 00:36:49.315
or do you show contempt for the
church of God and humiliate

00:36:49.315 --> 00:36:50.949
those who have nothing?
 

00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:54.670
What's going on here
apparently, remember I said,

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.539
the early Christian Eucharist
service,

00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:58.983
the Lord's Supper wasn't simply
a little bit of wafer and a

00:36:58.983 --> 00:36:59.869
little bit of wine.
 

00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:03.394
It's a meal of which part of it
would be then the saying the

00:37:03.394 --> 00:37:06.266
consecration thing;
repeating what Paul says Jesus

00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:07.744
had said,
"This is my body,

00:37:07.744 --> 00:37:09.840
do this in remembrance of me,
this is my blood,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.239
do this in my memory."
 

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:13.856
That might be part of it but
it's clearly part of a wider

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:16.518
meal and it looks like it was
something like a potluck.

00:37:16.518 --> 00:37:19.092
Either the rich--the rich are
members of the church and I

00:37:19.092 --> 00:37:21.070
don't mean to imply that they're
really,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.786
really rich,
we don't think any of these

00:37:22.786 --> 00:37:25.338
members of Paul's churches were
actually members of the top

00:37:25.338 --> 00:37:26.659
elite of the Roman Empire.
 

00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:28.833
They weren't senators,
they weren't even equestrians

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.880
but some of them clearly had
their own homes,

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.449
some of them clearly had
slaves, some of them clearly had

00:37:33.449 --> 00:37:35.329
some kind of access to financial
power.

00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:38.260
If they show up at the dinner
first,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.780
chances are they've either paid
for it themselves,

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.862
because in the ancient world it
was typical for people who were

00:37:43.862 --> 00:37:46.349
wealthier to supply something
for the community.

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:49.271
The wealthy people provided the
sacrifices for town sacrifices

00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:51.139
if the town didn't buy it
themselves.

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:52.768
Usually the town didn't buy it
themselves;

00:37:52.768 --> 00:37:56.021
usually what the town did was
it expected wealthy people in

00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:59.159
the town to pay for big civic
festivities and sacrifices,

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:00.730
so that's what happened.
 

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.766
Usually the wealthier people
would provide the stuff for the

00:38:03.766 --> 00:38:06.751
festival or the supper by paying
for it, or they might have

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.090
brought it themselves.
 

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.329
Imagine what you have is a
potluck like this.

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:13.045
If you're fairly well off you
can show up at,

00:38:13.045 --> 00:38:14.280
say, five o'clock.
 

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.409
I'm going to show up at five
o'clock with my buds,

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:18.030
we're going to have a little
drink before dinner,

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.407
brought a bottle wine,
and then the other people will

00:38:21.407 --> 00:38:24.460
show up when they can when they
get off work.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.139
Well, when you get off work,
if you're a laboring person or

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:30.123
a slave in the ancient world,
and slaves didn't work at

00:38:30.123 --> 00:38:32.889
regular jobs so they would
follow a work day.

00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:34.420
You got off work at sundown.
 

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.320
If you're a working person or
especially a slave you can't go

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.309
to the church service until the
sun is down.

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:43.088
By that time,
apparently some of the better

00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:44.699
off people have already been
there,

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:48.239
and Paul seems to say they're
already drinking and eating,

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.715
and having a good time before
the rest of the people even show

00:38:50.715 --> 00:38:50.920
up.
 

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.077
What he says,
he talks about people who have

00:38:53.077 --> 00:38:55.686
nothing, and he says,
don't you have homes to eat and

00:38:55.686 --> 00:38:56.340
drink in?
 

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.639
Well a lot of people in the
church would have said,

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:02.268
no we don't have homes;
we're poor.

00:39:02.268 --> 00:39:05.300
The poor lived kind of anywhere
they could.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.313
Paul is addressing two
different kinds of people in

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:12.333
this very chapter,
some of them have--in fact he

00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:14.219
calls them the haves and the
have-nots,

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:16.190
that's the Greek he uses.
 

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.673
The Lord's Supper is splitting
the church along this social

00:39:20.673 --> 00:39:24.498
status line and Paul's solution,
Paul even says,

00:39:24.498 --> 00:39:28.969
if you take The Lord's Supper
without discerning the body,

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:31.197
and what I think he's talking
about is discerning the body of

00:39:31.197 --> 00:39:32.755
Christ,
that is the other people there,

00:39:32.755 --> 00:39:34.400
and discerning the body of your
neighbor,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.208
if you don't pay attention to
the needs of the other bodies

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.514
that are there,
and you take the Lord's Supper,

00:39:39.514 --> 00:39:41.690
it will turn into poison and it
will kill you.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.030
He says that's why some of you
are getting sick.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.239
Paul believes that some of the
Corinthians,

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:49.081
because they're not taking the
Lord's Supper with the proper

00:39:49.081 --> 00:39:51.010
ethical concerns for their
neighbors,

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.365
the other church members,
are actually getting sick off

00:39:54.365 --> 00:39:57.349
the Lord's Supper rather than it
helping them.

00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:59.050
What is Paul's solution?
 

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.369
Wait.
 

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:02.898
If you're that hungry,
eat at home before you get

00:40:02.898 --> 00:40:06.059
there so you can wait on the
other people to come who have to

00:40:06.059 --> 00:40:06.849
come later.
 

00:40:06.849 --> 00:40:10.965
Paul's solution is to alter the
behavior of the higher status

00:40:10.965 --> 00:40:14.534
members of the church to
accommodate the needs of the

00:40:14.534 --> 00:40:17.210
lower status members of the
church.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.288
If you see what's going on here
you can see that Paul does this

00:40:20.288 --> 00:40:22.969
over and over again with these
different activities.

00:40:22.969 --> 00:40:25.809
I can't go into much detail,
go out and buy the book,

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.813
The Corinthian Body,
you can get it on Amazon.com

00:40:28.813 --> 00:40:30.670
and you can read all about it.
 

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:34.175
On each of these things I tried
to argue there that food offered

00:40:34.175 --> 00:40:36.179
to idols, what is Paul's
solution?

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:39.925
Well he says it won't
actually--you don't really have

00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:43.244
to worry about it,
but those of you who think it's

00:40:43.244 --> 00:40:46.619
okay to eat food offered to
idols should give it up if it's

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:49.880
going to cause people who think
it's wrong to do it,

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.532
to do it anyway,
because that might hurt their

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:52.010
conscience.
 

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.706
In other words--and it's also
clear that the people who would

00:40:54.706 --> 00:40:56.460
have thought this whole thing
about--

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.708
worrying about demons getting
to you because you eat idol

00:40:58.708 --> 00:41:00.632
meat,
if they thought that was

00:41:00.632 --> 00:41:02.916
ridiculous,
chances are they had some kind

00:41:02.916 --> 00:41:05.938
of exposure to ancient education
because ancient education taught

00:41:05.938 --> 00:41:08.844
people that that was ridiculous,
gods don't do that sort of

00:41:08.844 --> 00:41:09.170
thing.
 

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.570
The food offered to idols,
again, looks like it split the

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.000
church along these social class
lines.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.240
The resurrection of the body,
I said who would have found the

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.050
resurrection of the body to be a
ridiculous idea,

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.268
people with more education,
people exposed to a little bit

00:41:24.268 --> 00:41:25.230
more education.
 

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.719
Who would have been taking
people to court?

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.353
If you were poor in the ancient
world you didn't take people to

00:41:30.353 --> 00:41:31.670
court because you would lose.
 

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.724
Roman law was even explicit,
telling judges if you have a

00:41:34.724 --> 00:41:37.559
rich man in your case and a poor
man in the case,

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:39.614
well of course you'll decide in
the favor of the rich man

00:41:39.614 --> 00:41:41.119
because he has less incentive to
cheat.

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:44.043
The poor are the ones who have
incentive to cheat,

00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:47.445
so Roman law was clearly biased
toward the wealthy and the

00:41:47.445 --> 00:41:48.760
people with power.
 

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.789
If anybody is taking other
Christians to court it would be

00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:54.659
people of higher status not
people of lower status,

00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:57.655
and it may have been that
people of higher status were

00:41:57.655 --> 00:42:00.820
taking their lower status
Christian brothers to court.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.539
Paul then tells them,
don't go to court.

00:42:03.539 --> 00:42:06.512
If you have a dispute let it be
handled within the church

00:42:06.512 --> 00:42:06.989
itself.
 

00:42:06.989 --> 00:42:09.213
Now notice again,
just like he talked about

00:42:09.213 --> 00:42:11.436
Philemon last time,
who would have been the

00:42:11.436 --> 00:42:14.240
majority in the Corinthian
church, rich people or poor

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:14.929
people?
 

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:16.440
Poor people.
 

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.208
There may have been some people
who were better off but they

00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:21.413
would have been vastly
outnumbered by the poorer

00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:21.929
people.
 

00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:24.929
By telling the rich people they
have to handle their problems

00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:27.670
within the whole church,
he's placing the rich in a

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.561
situation where they're the
minority and that therefore

00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:33.130
increases the power of those of
lower status.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.018
In each of these cases,
in other words,

00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:38.309
I've argued that the Corinthian
church's problems--

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:41.210
were they were coming to
different views about Christ,

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.648
about the body,
about sex, about women and

00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:47.277
covering their heads when they
pray and prophesy and that sort

00:42:47.277 --> 00:42:49.353
of thing,
they were coming to these

00:42:49.353 --> 00:42:52.340
different views because they had
different exposures to upper

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.480
class ideology or lower class
ideology,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.820
to different exposures of
levels of education.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.920
Now what happened?
 

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.487
Well apparently 1 Corinthians,
as a letter did some good,

00:43:02.487 --> 00:43:05.420
because we have fortunately
other materials.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.719
From most of Paul's letters we
don't know whether they

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:10.280
succeeded or not because we
don't have any other writing.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.335
We do have 2 Corinthians,
which is made up of at least

00:43:13.335 --> 00:43:14.489
two other letters.
 

00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:18.045
2 Corinthians is actually--the
first part of it is one letter

00:43:18.045 --> 00:43:21.719
and then chapters 10-13 of 2
Corinthians is another letter,

00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:24.574
and if you read them side by
side you can tell because Paul's

00:43:24.574 --> 00:43:27.097
tone changes radically when he
gets to chapter 10 in 2

00:43:27.097 --> 00:43:27.860
Corinthians.
 

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.659
In 2 Corinthians we have at
least two more letters that Paul

00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:31.039
wrote.
 

00:43:31.039 --> 00:43:33.572
And then Paul mentions in 1
Corinthians another letter he

00:43:33.572 --> 00:43:35.427
wrote to them,
so there was another letter

00:43:35.427 --> 00:43:37.989
going back and forth;
we don't have that one probably.

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:40.552
In 2 Corinthians Paul mentions
a tearful letter,

00:43:40.552 --> 00:43:43.605
a letter he sent but was very
difficult for him to write,

00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:44.750
he cried over it.
 

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.344
Is that referring to another
letter, or does that refer to 2

00:43:49.344 --> 00:43:53.239
Corinthians 10-13,
which is a very angry letter?

00:43:53.239 --> 00:43:54.780
We don't know and there's a
debate about that.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.838
What we can tell is that the
basic things about Paul that

00:43:57.838 --> 00:44:01.282
Paul addresses in 1 Corinthians
seem to have been settled by the

00:44:01.282 --> 00:44:04.469
time we get to 2 Corinthians,
although he has other problems.

00:44:04.469 --> 00:44:09.170
The biggest problem is in that
section 10-13 of 2 Corinthians,

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:13.179
because here we get Paul having
to defend himself.

00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:16.730
And this is very telling
because Paul says,

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.070
well you're talking about these
"super Apostles,"

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.411
some other people must have
come on the scene we don't know

00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:24.110
who they were,
but Paul ironically calls them

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.139
super Apostles.
 

00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:26.860
You talk about these super
Apostles,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.880
they're perfectly willing to
mistreat you,

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.884
they're arrogant,
they treat you as if they have

00:44:30.884 --> 00:44:34.211
all the power,
pardon me that I was too

00:44:34.211 --> 00:44:35.639
weak to do that.
 

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:39.333
I treated you well,
but maybe that's my weakness

00:44:39.333 --> 00:44:40.670
showing itself.
 

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.786
Somebody has said,
well he's very strong in his

00:44:44.786 --> 00:44:50.155
letters, but in person he's kind
of a wimp, he's very weak in

00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:51.139
person.
 

00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:55.820
His speaking style,
well this was a social status

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.599
thing.
 

00:44:56.599 --> 00:44:59.570
A man in the ancient world,
if he was upper class,

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.376
upper status he was supposed to
be able to talk powerfully in

00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:04.389
public and if he couldn't he was
servile.

00:45:04.389 --> 00:45:09.336
In 2 Corinthians Paul is forced
to defend himself from charges

00:45:09.336 --> 00:45:12.744
that he is uneducated,
weak, and powerless,

00:45:12.744 --> 00:45:16.070
and therefore not much of an
Apostle.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.494
Now that goes on in 2
Corinthians, eventually what

00:45:19.494 --> 00:45:22.219
happens, we don't know what
happened.

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:25.592
Did writing this really
scathing letter to them in 2

00:45:25.592 --> 00:45:28.699
Corinthians 10-13,
did that settle the issue?

00:45:28.699 --> 00:45:30.867
Did they all just say,
okay, we were wrong,

00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:32.934
you're our Apostle,
you're the big daddy,

00:45:32.934 --> 00:45:34.070
everything's fine?
 

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.429
We don't know.
 

00:45:35.429 --> 00:45:37.208
We do have a reference in 2
Clement [correction:

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:39.336
1 Clement],
which is a letter written in

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.789
Rome around the end of the first
century,

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:44.751
beginning of the second
century, in which an author

00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:48.068
talks about the Corinthians as
being an ancient and great

00:45:48.068 --> 00:45:48.719
church.
 

00:45:48.719 --> 00:45:52.434
So at least by the next
generation the church in Corinth

00:45:52.434 --> 00:45:56.282
is strong and powerful and
respected, so eventually Paul's

00:45:56.282 --> 00:45:58.309
work in Corinth succeeded.
 

00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:00.884
What we see by looking at 1
Corinthians and 2 Corinthians

00:46:00.884 --> 00:46:03.768
all together,
is the struggles it took for

00:46:03.768 --> 00:46:06.530
Paul to get that church from
this,

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.273
what I call an adolescent
phase, where they're arguing

00:46:09.273 --> 00:46:11.666
about everything,
they're really confused about

00:46:11.666 --> 00:46:14.239
what they think about basic
doctrinal or life issues,

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:18.750
and then to finally settle down
into some kind of coherence.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.014
That's what makes these letters
really fascinating for us is

00:46:22.014 --> 00:46:24.891
that they give us little
snapshots of one church that

00:46:24.891 --> 00:46:27.824
Paul founded at at least three
different stages of its

00:46:27.824 --> 00:46:28.820
development.
 

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.597
Those three stages being
represented by what we can read

00:46:31.597 --> 00:46:34.005
from 1 Corinthians,
which kind of gives us one

00:46:34.005 --> 00:46:36.099
snapshot of this problem they're
having,

00:46:36.099 --> 00:46:39.922
what we can read from 2
Corinthians the first nine

00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:42.599
chapters,
which sounds like they've made

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:45.916
up and things are okay,
and what we can read by 2

00:46:45.916 --> 00:46:48.673
Corinthians 10-13,
which we don't know whether

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:51.438
that written after the first
part of 2 Corinthians or before

00:46:51.438 --> 00:46:51.719
it.
 

00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:54.918
It's difficult to place these
things, but it shows Paul in a

00:46:54.918 --> 00:46:57.739
very defensive posture with
regard to this church.

00:46:57.739 --> 00:47:02.802
We get a very good idea of how
churches struggled to actually

00:47:02.802 --> 00:47:07.949
start becoming what we are
seeing will become Christianity.

00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:09.650
They've got a long way to go
yet.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.590
Any questions or comments?
 

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:16.083
I've covered a lot of area
today, you can go back and read

00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:16.389
it.
 

00:47:16.389 --> 00:47:19.568
And I haven't even talked about
Philippians because I wanted to

00:47:19.568 --> 00:47:22.594
make sure that you understood
what was going on in scholarly

00:47:22.594 --> 00:47:24.750
opinion about the Corinthian
epistles.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.639
Any questions,
comments, outbursts?

00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:29.690
Okay, I will see you on
Wednesday.

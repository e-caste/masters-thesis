00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.945
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We had gotten,

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.100
at the end of last time,
to the Big Rip.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.072
This is where the
ever-expanding Cosmological

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.314
Constant--which is,
of course, a contradiction in

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.727
terms.
If you imagine that dark energy

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:19.090
is not a Cosmological Constant,
that it's actually increasing

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.220
in time, rips everything to
shreds.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.285
The Universe becomes infinite
in size in a finite amount of

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.400
time and everything gets pulled
apart.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.600
What I want to start by doing
today is to go back and do that

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.420
again slowly,
okay?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.450
Because I think this is not a
simple line of reasoning that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.445
leads you to this.
So, let's go all the way back

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:46.615
to what we know about the
Universe from observing

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:49.390
galaxies, supernovas,
things like that.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.565
We know that the Universe is
expanding and that,

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:59.100
we know.
Hubble already figured that out.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.862
We know this from the Hubble
Law, and from other--just,

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:13.251
in general, from the study of
standard candles at relatively

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:18.140
low redshift.
So, distances out to,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.266
I don't know,
Z of less than 0.2,

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.419
or so.
You can't tell the difference

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.950
between an accelerating or a
decelerating Universe.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.382
All you know is that it's
expanding, and you can figure

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:38.232
out how fast it's expanding.
Now, the next question then

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:42.661
becomes the rate of expansion.
Is the rate of expansion

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:44.880
changing?
Is it accelerating?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780
Is it decelerating?
What's going on there?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.536
And so, you want to compare
acceleration versus

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:56.154
deceleration,
which is a fancy word,

00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:59.670
as you know,
for slowing down.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.607
And deceleration:
this is relatively easy to

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:07.940
grasp.
This is what happens because of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.939
matter.
Matter exists.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.440
It's got gravitational force,
and gravitational force tends

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.304
to hold things together.
So, if you've got something

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.702
that's moving apart,
and there's some gravitational

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:20.956
force, it'll tend to hold it
together, and thus,

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:23.342
slow it down.
Most of the matter,

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:26.468
it turns out,
is this weird dark matter,

00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:30.876
which we don't understand,
but that's what's responsible

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:34.324
for the deceleration.
If you're going to make it go

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:37.102
faster, you need something much
weirder that pushes outward,

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:39.775
that has repulsive force.
This, we believe,

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:45.569
actually exists.
This, we label dark energy.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.940
And so, the question of,
"is it accelerating or is it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.893
decelerating," is basically a
question of how much dark energy

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:55.810
is there versus how much matter
is there,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.394
because the more--if you have
more of this than this,

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:02.219
then it will accelerate and
vice versa.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.168
And what we have discovered by
supernovae observations with

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:14.450
redshifts of greater than 0.3,
and by now, out to about a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.527
redshift of 1,
or so, demonstrate that--well,

00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:24.189
what exactly does this say?
Let's go slowly.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.006
In the past,
the Universe was expanding more

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:39.408
slowly than it is now,
and therefore--those three dots

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:46.699
are the mathematical symbol for
therefore.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.626
Therefore, the Universe is
accelerating,

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:59.160
and therefore,
there's more dark energy than

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.119
there is matter.
And you'll recall,

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.317
we did the little pie chart of
the Universe,

00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:07.616
and it turns out,
it's 3/4 dark energy and 1/4

00:04:07.616 --> 00:04:10.988
matter.
And those proportions are

00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:17.829
determined by the rate at which
the Universe is accelerating.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.449
Not the rate at which it's
expanding, but the rate at which

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.527
it's accelerating,
because that's the change in

00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:27.076
the expansion.
Fine, so far--or maybe it isn't

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:28.915
fine.
I should pose that as a

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:32.810
question.
Fine?

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.777
This is the basic premise of
where we had gotten to about a

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.199
week ago.
Yes sir?

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.959
Student: How does dark
energy cause acceleration?

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:41.000
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Huh?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.888
Student: How dark energy
[inaudible]

00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:42.882
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How dark energy

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.279
causes acceleration?
Excellent question.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.957
I have no idea,
because we don't have any idea

00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:51.476
what it is.
And it shows up-- the reason we

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:55.754
have even a name for it,
you know, is that it showed up

00:04:55.754 --> 00:05:00.270
in Einstein's equations as a
potential contribution to the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.470
Universe that you could add,
but didn't have to.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.635
A constant of integration,
for those of you who like that

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:10.250
kind of thing.
What it is, physically?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.810
Very hard to understand.
The only physical explanation

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.310
that's been offered--well,
many have been offered.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.104
But the only one that connects
to anything else we know is the

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:25.209
idea that it's the vacuum energy
predicted by quantum mechanics.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:29.238
And it turns out that if that's
true, it ought to be 10^(120)

00:05:29.238 --> 00:05:31.738
times stronger.
And so, that's not a good

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:33.911
prediction.
And so, exactly how this

00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:37.589
works--what the mechanism is,
what the nature of this stuff

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.829
is?
Completely unknown.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.870
And the only reason we think
it's there is that we see its

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.540
effect.
We see the Universe getting

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.678
faster.
And so, it's just a name that's

00:05:48.678 --> 00:05:50.840
attached to whatever is causing
that effect.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.585
Okay. Yes?
Student: How do you know

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.430
the Universe is expanding more
slowly?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.065
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Was expanding more

00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:03.079
slowly than it is now,
right.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:08.414
So, that is this transformation
between these two different

00:06:08.414 --> 00:06:13.645
kinds of graphs,
one of which is the observed

00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:21.308
graph and one of which is the
plot of the scale factor versus

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:24.520
time.
Here's now.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.790
Here's 1.
We're at 1 and now.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.236
And so, if it were not
accelerating,

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:36.540
if it were just coasting along,
that would be a straight line.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.783
And what happens is,
we can look back into the past

00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:44.213
and what we see is this.
So, at this point,

00:06:44.213 --> 00:06:47.203
if you think about it--believe
me, for a sec,

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:50.360
that this is true.
Supposing you were sitting here.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.430
The rate of expansion is the
slope of this line.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.740
That's how much you're
expanding.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.379
And so, at this point,
the slope is shallower than it

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.587
is up here.
And so, one interpretation of

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:08.865
this line is that in the past,
it used to be expanding,

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:12.667
you know, like this,
and now, it's expanding like

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.973
this.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:16.935
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:19.850
how do you know it's doing that
particular shape?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.207
Well, you, of course,
observe points all along the

00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:28.423
way, here.
Now, we're about to get to the

00:07:28.423 --> 00:07:31.660
question of whether that shape
actually continues.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.402
If you asked,
how do you know that it would

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:36.621
continue this way,
that, of course,

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.826
you don't know for sure.
If you invent some piece of

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:45.931
magic whereby everything changes
right now for some obscure

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:50.420
reason, it could go off in some
other direction.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.786
But the assumption is that
whatever it is that's--that we

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:56.770
do not live at a special time,
and that, therefore,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.111
whatever it is that's doing the
accelerating is going to keep at

00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.914
it.
And indeed, the whole of the

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.194
Big Rip, which is where I'm
going with this,

00:08:04.194 --> 00:08:06.209
comes about by asking the
question,

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:09.336
supposing the acceleration rate
is changing in a different way

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:11.490
from the way we thought it was
going to.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.006
Just to complete the thought
here, the way this works out in

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:20.559
the observational plane,
you'll recall,

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:23.913
looks like this.
Here's the empty Universe in

00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:27.474
this set of units.
And you observe a bunch of

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:31.699
supernovae and they seem to be
doing that.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:34.420
And that line,
if you, then,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.356
transform redshift and
distance--this is kind of a

00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:45.200
weird measure of distance--into
scale factor and time.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.723
Let me make this line solid,
so that the two graphs

00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:52.951
correspond.
This line and that line

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:57.200
correspond with each other.
And so, as you observe many

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.183
points along here,
that's essentially observing

00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:01.870
many points along here.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:13.039
Okay, yes?
Student: Given the

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.491
empirical data that we know now,
if we were to extra--to improve

00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:19.433
to extrapolate that curve,
would it actually intersect

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.490
with the t-axis or would
we need to have [Inaudible]?

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.173
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:24.940
let me come back to that.
Let me come back to that.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.200
The answer is,
yes, it does go to zero.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.485
It doesn't keep going up like
this, but let me come back to

00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:37.040
that in a second,
and you'll see why.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.610
Okay.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:46.815
So, it's all a balance of dark
energy versus dark matter,

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:50.494
or matter, in general,
but the dark matter

00:09:50.494 --> 00:09:53.337
predominates.
And, at the moment,

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:57.220
it is true that the dark energy
is--there's more of it.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.239
It exerts more,
more of an influence on the

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.021
Universe;
therefore, the Universe is not

00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.610
just expanding,
but also accelerating.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.893
We know that because these
points are above the line,

00:10:08.893 --> 00:10:12.396
not below the line.
But this didn't always have to

00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:17.050
be true.
This balance changes with time.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.375
So, currently,
DE blows away the DM,

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:29.580
but this can change.
This changes.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:36.649
In fact, this is almost certain
to change with time.

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:40.193
And the reason is that the
energy density of the dark

00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:43.872
energy and the matter density of
the dark matter behave

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:47.620
differently as you change the
size of the Universe.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:56.499
It's all about the density
here, so, matter density in the

00:10:56.499 --> 00:11:01.295
past.
You have the same amount of

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:06.510
matter, but the Universe was
smaller.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.039
Density is equal to mass over
volume.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:18.889
So, if you have the same
M, but smaller V,

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:22.390
this would have to have been
bigger in the past.

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:28.764
And, in fact,
it goes as the scale factor

00:11:28.764 --> 00:11:31.500
cubed, or 1 over the scale
factor cubed.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.899
Just because volume goes as a
linear scale cubed.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.981
So, in the past,
there was--the matter density

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.720
was much greater than it is
right now,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.594
and therefore,
the gravitational force trying

00:11:44.594 --> 00:11:48.317
to hold the Universe together
was greater than it is right

00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:52.783
now.
But the Cosmological Constant

00:11:52.783 --> 00:12:01.760
is constant, and what that means
is that its density is constant.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:11.238
And what that means is that,
in the past,

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:18.270
the dark energy density was the
same as it is now.

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:27.394
That's just the way this
particular piece of Einstein's

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.649
equations works.
It's a constant.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:31.714
Now, if you're about to ask the
question, well,

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:34.361
how does anything behave that
way, I'm going to give you the

00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.480
same answer.
You know, they have this

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.921
wonderful thing in the British
Parliament where they ask the

00:12:39.921 --> 00:12:42.779
Prime Minister
questions--obnoxious questions.

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:45.987
And when they start getting too
many obnoxious questions in a

00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:48.722
row, what he'll do is,
he'll look at the camera and

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:51.680
say, "I refer the Honorable
Gentleman to the answer I gave

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.391
some moments ago."
So, if you're going to ask what

00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:57.478
this is and why it behaves that
way, I will refer you to the

00:12:57.478 --> 00:13:00.670
answer I gave to the Honorable
Gentleman some moments ago;

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.396
namely, I don't have a clue.
Something they don't generally

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:09.110
say in political situations.
All right.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.596
So, it's the same as now.
But look at the implication of

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:14.741
this.
If the matter density gets

00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:20.559
bigger and bigger and bigger as
you go into the past,

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:25.804
and the dark energy density
does not, then at some point in

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:30.777
the past, it must have been true
that the matter density

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:37.348
overwhelms the dark energy.
And then, at some point in the

00:13:37.348 --> 00:13:44.508
past, the dark energy and the
dark matter exert comparable

00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:50.746
effects on the Universe.
And before that,

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:59.463
dark matter wins--that is to
say, the Universe was

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:04.186
decelerating.
Now turn this around and go in

00:14:04.186 --> 00:14:10.792
chronological order.
From the start of the Universe

00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:18.730
until some moment,
the Universe decelerated.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:25.840
It was expanding,
but it kept getting slower.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:32.687
Then, after some moment--and we
know that this moment was in our

00:14:32.687 --> 00:14:39.100
past, because after this moment,
it starts to accelerate.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.500
And we know that it's
accelerating now.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.442
And so, at some point in the
past, there was a magic moment

00:14:45.442 --> 00:14:47.928
where everything balanced,
and then, it started to

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:50.078
accelerate.
So, now, what does this look

00:14:50.078 --> 00:14:51.070
like on our graphs?

00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:57.090
What does this look like on the
graphs, here?

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.416
Well, let's do the a
versus t thing,

00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:00.960
again.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.908
Here we are.
Here's our reference empty

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.528
Universe.
And so, recently,

00:15:11.528 --> 00:15:14.463
it's been accelerating.
So, you know,

00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:17.456
if we look into the past.
And then, the prediction is,

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:20.790
the extrapolation back to zero
looks kind of like this.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.458
And remember,
if it looks like this,

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:34.302
it's decelerating.
If it looks like this,

00:15:34.302 --> 00:15:39.924
it's accelerating.
And so, the dotted lines are

00:15:39.924 --> 00:15:45.688
extrapolations based on the idea
that the dark energy is the

00:15:45.688 --> 00:15:49.952
Cosmological Constant,
and the dark matter behaves

00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:53.540
like matter ought to behave.
And so, if you make those two

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.789
assumptions, this is the curve
you get.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:16:01.879
And so, this is what you expect
for Ω_matter = .25;

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:08.290
Ω_λ = .75 at
present.

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:17.796
And so, you can predict,
given these two quantities,

00:16:17.796 --> 00:16:22.060
and a measurement of
H_0 equals

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.104
about 70.
This gives you an age of the

00:16:25.104 --> 00:16:27.340
Universe.
That is to say,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:33.099
the time from when a = 0
to now--of the Universe,

00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:38.262
of something like 13 point;
I think it's actually,

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:41.297
at the moment,
13.4 billion years,

00:16:41.297 --> 00:16:44.055
plus or minus,
I don't know .4,

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:49.664
or something like that.
Under the assumption that λ

00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:56.059
equals--that the Cosmological
Constant really is constant,

00:16:56.059 --> 00:16:59.377
that you've got these kinds of
proportions, and this kind of

00:16:59.377 --> 00:17:02.151
current Hubble Constant.
And then, you can just

00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:05.609
extrapolate all these lines in
whatever direction you like,

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.233
and figure out where it crosses
a = 0.

00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:10.228
Yes?
Student: Can we see back

00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:12.344
to [Inaudible]
see it as deceleration or is it

00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:13.538
[Inaudible]?
Professor Charles

00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:15.111
Bailyn: Excellent question.
The question is,

00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.079
"Can we see far back in the
past to see this deceleration?"

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.983
The answer is,
just about yes,

00:17:19.983 --> 00:17:22.740
and I'll show you some data in
a second.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.343
Because this is a very strong
prediction of the model--that is

00:17:26.343 --> 00:17:28.470
to say that it should turn
around.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.475
If you're imagining that
there's something wacky about

00:17:31.475 --> 00:17:33.878
supernovae, and that,
as you go into the past,

00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:36.533
they look fainter or something,
as you were assuming on the

00:17:36.533 --> 00:17:38.662
problem set,
then you wouldn't necessarily

00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:41.648
predict that that would turn
around and do the other thing as

00:17:41.648 --> 00:17:44.731
you go further back in the past.
So, this is a very strong

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.362
prediction of what ought to
happen cosmologically,

00:17:47.362 --> 00:17:49.992
and so, of course,
people have been trying to test

00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:50.690
it.
Yes?

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.055
Student: If the density
of the Universe is changing,

00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:55.583
then wouldn't it indicate that
we're in some special time right

00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:57.082
now,
given the fact that the current

00:17:57.082 --> 00:17:59.124
density of the Universe is
really close to the critical

00:17:59.124 --> 00:17:59.924
density?
Professor Charles

00:17:59.924 --> 00:18:01.945
Bailyn: Yeah.
So, the question is about,

00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:05.684
if the density is changing,
why does the--what's so unusual

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:09.230
about now, that we're close to
the critical density?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.000
The thing you have to remember
is, the critical density also

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.321
changes with time.
It's based on--remember the

00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:18.263
critical density.
It's 3H^(2) over

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.971
something or other.
Well, H changes with

00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.864
time, because the velocity is
more or less the same,

00:18:23.864 --> 00:18:26.113
but the distances all change.
Student: So,

00:18:26.113 --> 00:18:27.369
it's always been pretty close
to the critical density?

00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:28.953
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:18:28.953 --> 00:18:30.880
what is true is that--the way
it works out,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.930
mathematically,
what's true is that the sum of

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.319
these two quantities has always
been close to 1.

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:42.871
The ratio changes,
but the sum of these two--if

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.940
the total Ω starts as 1,
it stays at 1.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.758
But, it turns out,
it's the total Ω that you

00:18:50.758 --> 00:18:56.536
can--that is conserved.
And we'll come back to that

00:18:56.536 --> 00:19:07.960
point a little later.
Okay, let's see.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.339
Right. Okay. So, yes.
Let's go there.

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:12.400
Let's go for the observational
evidence.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.320
What would you expect it to be?
Here we go.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.162
This one, again.
We keep going back and forth

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:21.849
between these two plots.
That's what it's all about.

00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:24.109
So, here's empty Universe,
as always.

00:19:24.109 --> 00:19:31.849
And then, in this plot,
acceleration means a positive

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:35.346
slope.
So, if you're moving up in this

00:19:35.346 --> 00:19:39.736
plot, the Universe has been
accelerating--is accelerating at

00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:43.845
that particular redshift,
at that particular time in the

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:44.988
past.
So, you know,

00:19:44.988 --> 00:19:48.567
the data we've looked at so far
kind of look like points along a

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:51.063
line like this.
That's the demonstration that

00:19:51.063 --> 00:19:52.790
the Universe is now
accelerating.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.440
So, here's the prediction.

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:01.903
And, you know,
here's a magic moment where,

00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:05.180
at that point,
this slope is flat,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.652
and so, on this side,
it's decelerating,

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:14.009
and on this side,
it's accelerating.

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.822
And the question is,
is it getting further away

00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:22.380
from--is it moving up compared
to the empty Universe,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.309
or is it moving down compared
to the empty Universe?

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:28.413
Because the empty Universe
neither accelerates nor

00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:30.536
decelerates.
That's the definition of an

00:20:30.536 --> 00:20:32.620
empty Universe.
It doesn't have any mass.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.890
It doesn't have any energy.
The expansion rate is constant

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.527
forever.
So, if you're going this way

00:20:39.527 --> 00:20:43.161
with respect to that line,
or going this way with respect

00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:45.248
to that line,
you're accelerating,

00:20:45.248 --> 00:20:48.133
and if you're coming back,
going in the other direction,

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:52.207
you're decelerating.
So, here's a closed Universe,

00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:55.430
right?
This is a Big Crunch Universe,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:00.407
which is going to re-collapse,
because it's decelerating all

00:21:00.407 --> 00:21:03.007
the time.
Now, interestingly,

00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:07.270
this turnaround point,
where you turn around between

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:12.034
accelerating and decelerating,
is not so far back into the

00:21:12.034 --> 00:21:14.880
past.
If you believe this set of

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.900
parameters, the standard model,
it's at around 0.8.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:24.873
We can see stuff at 0.8.
And you could hope to go and

00:21:24.873 --> 00:21:29.678
see things even further out.
Turns out, it's kind of--now,

00:21:29.678 --> 00:21:33.671
right at--if you only go out to
about 0.8, which is about as far

00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:36.460
out as they did for the first
time round,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.712
you're not going to see the
turnaround, because,

00:21:38.712 --> 00:21:40.630
you know, it's just more or
less flat.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.678
You've got a few points out
there, and you're going to have

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.621
a tough time telling the
difference between that and that

00:21:46.621 --> 00:21:49.792
at this point here.
But if you go out just a little

00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:53.527
bit further, you might really be
able to see this turnaround

00:21:53.527 --> 00:21:55.914
happening.
Unfortunately,

00:21:55.914 --> 00:22:00.829
that turns out to be hard,
observationally.

00:22:00.829 --> 00:22:07.706
It's hard to see supernovae
with redshifts greater than 1,

00:22:07.706 --> 00:22:12.050
for a number of different
reasons.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.794
First of all, they're faint.
The further away they are,

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:18.521
the fainter they are.
Second of all,

00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:23.734
they appear on top of galaxies.
Obviously, they live in

00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:26.522
galaxies.
The further away you look,

00:22:26.522 --> 00:22:31.220
the galaxies look smaller,
and so, the supernova appear to

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:37.085
be--the further away you look,
the more light from the galaxy

00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:40.650
the supernova is superimposed
on.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.229
And it becomes harder to
separate the light from the

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:48.369
supernova and the light from the
galaxy that it lives in.

00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:54.370
And the third part is that the
light is redshifted.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.619
Very redshifted.
Redshifted by a factor of two.

00:22:57.619 --> 00:23:00.945
So, supernovae give off most of
their light in optical light,

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:03.715
which we can observe.
But by the time they're at a

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.692
redshift of 1,
all the wavelengths are

00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:09.045
doubled.
And so, most of the radiation

00:23:09.045 --> 00:23:13.432
is in the infrared,
which is much harder to see

00:23:13.432 --> 00:23:17.914
from the ground,
because everything glows in the

00:23:17.914 --> 00:23:20.817
infrared.
And, as I said before,

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:23.240
it's like looking in the
daytime.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.839
The whole sky is glowing.
Your telescope is glowing.

00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:31.400
It's just really hard to make
those kinds of observations.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.216
It is possible,
however, to do--it's much

00:23:34.216 --> 00:23:36.400
easier to do this from space.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.229
Now, faint is faint.
It doesn't matter whether

00:23:43.229 --> 00:23:45.778
you're in orbit or not.
But the other two things are

00:23:45.778 --> 00:23:47.890
greatly aided by looking from
space.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:55.489
Point two.
You get much better images from

00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:57.539
space.
And you may recall,

00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:59.912
last time, I showed you a
picture of a supernova,

00:23:59.912 --> 00:24:02.966
and from the ground,
you know, it was a little extra

00:24:02.966 --> 00:24:06.734
light on top of some galaxy.
And then, when you looked from

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:09.500
space, the galaxy was clearly
delineated.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.619
And then, the supernova was a
tiny point in the outskirts of

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:15.172
that galaxy.
So, it makes it much,

00:24:15.172 --> 00:24:19.920
much easier to separate the
galaxy from the supernova.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.104
And it is also true that the
infrared background light is

00:24:26.104 --> 00:24:30.963
much fainter,
because you can keep stuff cold

00:24:30.963 --> 00:24:35.862
out there.
The infrared background light

00:24:35.862 --> 00:24:42.220
is much fainter and there's no
atmospheric absorption.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.287
The atmosphere actually absorbs
a large fraction of the infrared

00:24:48.287 --> 00:24:51.550
light that hits us.
That's actually why the

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.192
greenhouse effect works,
because light comes in as

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:57.049
optical light and it makes it
all the way through.

00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:58.980
Then, it heats up the surface
of the Earth.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.142
The Earth radiates heat,
which doesn't make it through

00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:04.349
the atmosphere and it gets
trapped.

00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:07.811
So, there's no atmospheric
absorption out there,

00:25:07.811 --> 00:25:12.230
and so, you have a much easier
time doing this from space.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.563
So, what they have been doing
is, recently,

00:25:15.563 --> 00:25:19.690
people, and in particular,
a guy named Adam Riess,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:26.582
have been using the space
telescope, the Hubble Space

00:25:26.582 --> 00:25:32.680
Telescope, to find high redshift
supernovae.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.710
There is a flaw in the way the
space telescope is designed from

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.089
the point of view of trying to
do this experiment.

00:25:40.089 --> 00:25:44.250
And the flaw is that it doesn't
look at very much of the sky at

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.920
once.
It only looks at a small field

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.580
of view.

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:58.616
So, you don't find many,
because you're just not looking

00:25:58.616 --> 00:26:04.737
at that big a part of the sky.
And so, you only look at a tiny

00:26:04.737 --> 00:26:08.130
piece of the sky at once.
However, they have

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.665
spent--because this is of some
clear importance,

00:26:10.665 --> 00:26:13.484
they have spent many,
many, many hundreds of

00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:17.782
observing hours with the space
telescope trying to track down a

00:26:17.782 --> 00:26:21.039
few supernovae at a redshift
greater than 1.

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:23.890
And they have now succeeded in
doing so.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.000
So, here's what the data look
like.

00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:32.839
This is from Adam's recent
paper, 2004.

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:34.990
I guess it's no longer quite so
recent.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:42.030
And this is the plot.
Let me see if I can focus this.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.974
It's actually the Xerox quality.
We have a joke in astronomy

00:26:46.974 --> 00:26:51.319
that many important objects turn
out to be LSXTS,

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:55.573
which stands for Low
Significant Xerox Transient

00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:58.099
Source.
That means you've made a Xerox

00:26:58.099 --> 00:27:00.834
and a little blip appears on
your graph and somebody says,

00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:03.329
what's that point in the upper
right-hand corner?

00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:04.990
And you say,
oh, that's the Xerox machine.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.960
All right.
So, I apologize for that.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.950
But look what's happening.
This is redshift.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.926
This is the plot we've been
looking at before,

00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:16.470
0, .5,1.0,1.5,
and 2.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.660
And this is the Delta (m
– M) axis.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:26.849
So, 0 is what you expect the
empty Universe to have.

00:27:26.849 --> 00:27:30.228
And he has marked on here a
different set of lines from the

00:27:30.228 --> 00:27:32.984
set of lines I've been drawing.
But, nevertheless,

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:36.346
you can see what's going on.
Here are--these are all

00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:40.029
supernovae--all the supernovae
they know.

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:42.806
These kinds of fuzzy gray
points are the ones they found

00:27:42.806 --> 00:27:46.058
with the space telescope.
The ones in here are the

00:27:46.058 --> 00:27:48.970
ground-based ones known at the
time.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.566
And what they've done is
they've averaged them together

00:27:52.566 --> 00:27:55.630
in groups of redshift,
grouping by redshift.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.190
That's the bottom thing.
So, each one of these points is

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.893
an average of many supernovae.
This point is an average of

00:28:02.893 --> 00:28:05.397
these two.
And then, as you get down to

00:28:05.397 --> 00:28:07.719
lower redshifts where they have
lots and lots of them,

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:10.421
the precision gets much better.
But you can definitely see

00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:12.783
what's happening.
Here, out to about,

00:28:12.783 --> 00:28:15.430
you know, .5,
.8, it's going up.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.160
And then, it does definitely
seem like it's going down.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.638
And so, there really is,
now, some evidence for this

00:28:23.638 --> 00:28:27.461
turnaround.
Now, it kind of all depends on

00:28:27.461 --> 00:28:31.019
these two points.
I have a rule of thumb.

00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:34.406
My rule of thumb is you can put
your thumb over any one point,

00:28:34.406 --> 00:28:37.627
because you never know what
screw up might have happened in

00:28:37.627 --> 00:28:41.257
any one measurement.
So, I can't really do that on

00:28:41.257 --> 00:28:43.763
the top.
But if I do this,

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:50.095
and I make that point go away,
you could still kind of draw a

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:55.143
line that keeps going up.
It would miss this point by a

00:28:55.143 --> 00:28:59.460
little, but not by a lot.
It's really this that does it.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.752
It's these last two individual
supernovae down there,

00:29:02.752 --> 00:29:06.550
which really make the case that
the thing is turning over and

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.181
coming back down.
Now, you have to worry a little

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:14.412
bit--and there's actually a good
reason to worry about the

00:29:14.412 --> 00:29:17.529
brightness of high redshift
supernovae.

00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:27.639
And let me give you one
particular reason to worry,

00:29:27.639 --> 00:29:36.970
namely, gravitational lensing.
Remember gravitational lensing?

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.116
You stick some mass in the
middle, between you and the

00:29:40.116 --> 00:29:43.000
object you're looking at.
It focuses the light.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.610
Gravitational lensing makes
things look brighter.

00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:54.823
The further away you look at
something, the more likely it is

00:29:54.823 --> 00:29:57.439
that there's something in
between that will do the

00:29:57.439 --> 00:30:01.012
lensing.
So, first of all,

00:30:01.012 --> 00:30:09.464
point one: more distant
objects, more likely to be

00:30:09.464 --> 00:30:11.190
lensed.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.544
Point two: if you're out
looking for very distant,

00:30:18.544 --> 00:30:22.160
very faint objects,
which are the ones you're going

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.420
to see first?
Student: The bright ones.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.335
Professor Charles
Bailyn: The bright ones,

00:30:27.335 --> 00:30:30.111
yes.
At the, sort of,

00:30:30.111 --> 00:30:35.688
faint limit,
you see abnormally bright

00:30:35.688 --> 00:30:40.734
things first.
I can't even spell

00:30:40.734 --> 00:30:47.760
that--abnormally bright things,
preferentially.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.280
So, you could imagine,
if you're basing your entire

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.750
cosmology on one or two high
redshift supernovae,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.353
you got to ask yourself the
question: supposing those happen

00:31:01.353 --> 00:31:04.994
to be lensed?
So, let me now go back to this

00:31:04.994 --> 00:31:08.180
plot.
Here's the plot.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.525
So, if they're lensed,
then they're brighter--then

00:31:11.525 --> 00:31:14.940
they seem to be brighter than
they actually are.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.420
They're actually fainter than
they look.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.787
That would have the effect that
this one actually ought to be up

00:31:21.787 --> 00:31:25.046
here, and this one actually
ought to be up here,

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:27.750
if they were lensed by some
amount.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.150
So, if these things are lenses,
then the true,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.190
correct position of these
points would be higher up in the

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.098
graph than it actually is.
So, this is the effect of

00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:37.930
lensing.

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:45.757
Now, when it was only one of
these points,

00:31:45.757 --> 00:31:48.349
people were very concerned
about this.

00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:51.193
Now that there's two,
people are a lot less

00:31:51.193 --> 00:31:54.376
concerned, because,
you know, it would be pretty

00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:58.303
bad luck to have both of the
supernovae that you know about

00:31:58.303 --> 00:32:01.349
at high redshift turn out to be
lensed.

00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:04.311
If they had twenty,
this whole problem would go

00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:08.238
away, because there would be no
possible way that you could be

00:32:08.238 --> 00:32:10.914
so unlucky--well,
you could calculate the

00:32:10.914 --> 00:32:14.369
probability that you would be so
unlucky as to have the first

00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:17.997
twenty high redshift supernovae
you know happen to line up right

00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:21.749
behind some massive object,
and it would be some incredibly

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.205
small probability.
So, each time you observe

00:32:24.205 --> 00:32:26.775
another one of these things out
there and it's low,

00:32:26.775 --> 00:32:28.779
you get around this lensing
problem.

00:32:28.779 --> 00:32:31.339
I should say this is only one
of a number of problems.

00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:33.180
These things are very hard to
observe.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.978
They're very faint objects.
But, nevertheless,

00:32:36.978 --> 00:32:42.082
I think, at the moment,
the evidence for this

00:32:42.082 --> 00:32:49.740
turnaround is highly suggestive,
but not yet wholly conclusive.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.394
All right.
But now, suppose you actually

00:32:53.394 --> 00:32:58.445
want to get higher accuracy than
just seeing the thing

00:32:58.445 --> 00:33:05.621
turnaround.
Because, suppose dark energy

00:33:05.621 --> 00:33:11.128
isn't constant.
Suppose the Big Rip really is

00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:19.714
going to happen.
Then, DE density increases with

00:33:19.714 --> 00:33:23.774
time.
This leads to the Big Rip,

00:33:23.774 --> 00:33:28.135
as we discussed last time.
And therefore,

00:33:28.135 --> 00:33:34.830
the dark energy density was
less in the past than in now.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:43.703
And therefore,
the deceleration,

00:33:43.703 --> 00:33:54.393
the moment of balance between
deceleration and acceleration

00:33:54.393 --> 00:34:00.021
was more recent.
Because, as you go back in the

00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:03.903
past under this new scenario
where the density of dark energy

00:34:03.903 --> 00:34:06.965
is increasing with time,
it's therefore decreasing as

00:34:06.965 --> 00:34:09.728
you go into the past.
So, as you go into the past,

00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:13.123
two things happen – the
density of matter gets bigger,

00:34:13.123 --> 00:34:15.840
and the density of dark energy
gets less.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.730
So, there's an additional
effect that will make that

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:24.868
crossover happen earlier.
And so, to summarize on these,

00:34:24.868 --> 00:34:31.320
by now, almost boring and
ubiquitous plots,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.980
here.
All right.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:39.122
So, here's the,
kind of, standard cosmological

00:34:39.122 --> 00:34:43.579
model, and if it's going to be
a--oh,

00:34:43.579 --> 00:34:46.240
and then, this predicts in the
future that it's going to go

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.655
something like,
if it's a Big Rip,

00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:52.015
then what happens is,
it's doing this,

00:34:52.015 --> 00:34:58.405
and it's going to do that.
Because the dark matter takes

00:34:58.405 --> 00:35:05.269
over from the dark energy more
recently in the past.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:08.138
Because you've also lost oomph
in your dark energy,

00:35:08.138 --> 00:35:11.579
but the dark energy's getting
bigger and bigger with time.

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:19.039
This, then, translates onto
this plot.

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:22.928
And here is what we expect,
and here's the kind of

00:35:22.928 --> 00:35:28.840
prediction into the future.
Future of observations.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.684
Further into the past in time.
And what you would expect is

00:35:32.684 --> 00:35:35.470
that this would sort of keel
over earlier.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:46.375
So, this is a Big Rip cosmology.
Big Rip cosmology has the

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:55.329
same--Big Rip would have the
same expansion rate now,

00:35:55.329 --> 00:36:02.096
the same acceleration now,
but more acceleration in the

00:36:02.096 --> 00:36:11.771
future than you'd expect,
and more deceleration in the

00:36:11.771 --> 00:36:13.120
past.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:22.191
And so, it's important,
not just to see this

00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:26.123
turnaround, but to actually
plot, in detail,

00:36:26.123 --> 00:36:30.206
where that line goes.
Because, if it turns out that

00:36:30.206 --> 00:36:33.179
your supernovae are kind of
lined up like this,

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:36.012
or they're kind of lined up
like this--you already know that

00:36:36.012 --> 00:36:38.845
there are a bunch of them like
this--or that they're kind of

00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:41.781
lined up like this,
makes a huge difference in how

00:36:41.781 --> 00:36:45.323
you understand the dark energy,
and tells you something new

00:36:45.323 --> 00:36:48.360
about the dark energy.
In fact, it tells you the first

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.992
thing you know about the dark
energy other than that it

00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:53.619
exists--namely,
that it would be getting bigger

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:57.005
or less big, or maybe staying
constant as a function of time.

00:36:57.005 --> 00:36:59.093
Yes?
Student: Well if the

00:36:59.093 --> 00:37:02.794
deceleration was earlier than
expected following the Big Bip

00:37:02.794 --> 00:37:05.289
cosmology,
wouldn't we have seen it

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:08.683
already since we [Inaudible]?
Professor Charles

00:37:08.683 --> 00:37:10.818
Bailyn: So,
these three lines,

00:37:10.818 --> 00:37:12.952
at about, you know,
0.8, are very,

00:37:12.952 --> 00:37:16.511
very close together.
They don't diverge all that

00:37:16.511 --> 00:37:21.043
much until a redshift--until the
turnaround, at about a redshift

00:37:21.043 --> 00:37:23.335
of .8 to 1.
Now, in principle,

00:37:23.335 --> 00:37:27.047
you could go out and make a
whole bunch of--you know,

00:37:27.047 --> 00:37:30.617
measure 10,000 of these things
at a redshift of .5,

00:37:30.617 --> 00:37:33.330
and try and distinguish that
way.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.735
Okay.
So, how are we going to figure

00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:36.940
this out?
The space telescope,

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.659
kind of, finds these things one
at a time.

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:41.150
It's going to be awfully tough
to make this distinction.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.729
But let me introduce you to two
projects currently underway,

00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:48.989
the goal of which is to figure
this out.

00:37:48.989 --> 00:37:52.349
They do the exact two things
that we've just been talking

00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:54.343
about.
One is designed to go

00:37:54.343 --> 00:37:58.164
deep-to-high redshift,
and the other is designed to do

00:37:58.164 --> 00:38:01.480
many, many, many,
at intermediate redshift.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:07.568
So, there is something called
the--so, there's a space

00:38:07.568 --> 00:38:15.042
mission, space telescope.
This is called JDEM,

00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:23.349
stands for Joint Dark Energy
Mission.

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:27.467
And the joint means joint
between NASA and the Department

00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:29.753
of Energy.
Whoever named this stuff dark

00:38:29.753 --> 00:38:32.463
energy gets a little prize,
because now we get money from

00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:34.400
the Department of Energy to
study it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.494
Let's see.
And the idea--of which an

00:38:39.494 --> 00:38:42.670
example is something called Snap
1 Proposal.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:52.090
That's the supernova
acceleration probe.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.809
Student: This is part of
the JDEM?

00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:56.373
Professor Charles
Bailyn: This is an example

00:38:56.373 --> 00:38:58.270
of one mission proposed to be
JDEM.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:03.612
This is an example.
And it's an example I'm

00:39:03.612 --> 00:39:05.376
familiar with,
because we have people here at

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.860
Yale who are working on it.
And there are competitors.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.590
They haven't actually selected
the thing yet.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.606
And what this is going to be
is, it's a space telescope that

00:39:15.606 --> 00:39:19.760
differs from the current space
telescope in two major ways.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:26.682
One is, it has a wide field of
view, dozens of times bigger

00:39:26.682 --> 00:39:30.860
than the current space
telescope.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.110
So, it can do twenty--let me
see if I can remember.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:38.126
It's like twenty--it's over 100
times bigger field of view than

00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:41.445
the current space telescope.
So, the discovery rate of

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:43.590
supernovae will be much,
much greater.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.960
And it's optimized for the
infrared.

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:56.854
And so, its goal is to find
many supernovae with redshift

00:39:56.854 --> 00:40:03.080
greater than 1,
perhaps out to a redshift of 2.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.608
That's its purpose in life.
And proposals are currently

00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:11.934
being evaluated for this.
Launch time is supposed to

00:40:11.934 --> 00:40:14.786
be–well, the optimists say
2013, but that means

00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:18.530
congressional funding this year,
which is actually unlikely.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:23.050
More likely 2016 or 2017,
and then, we'll know.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.764
Yes?
Student: Is optimization

00:40:24.764 --> 00:40:26.469
for infrared or are there any
other predicted,

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:27.670
sort of, benefits of having
[Inaudible]

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.869
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:32.816
it's very nice to look at the
infrared, because anything at

00:40:32.816 --> 00:40:35.469
high redshift shines in the
infrared.

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:38.076
And so, if you're looking at
high redshift galaxies,

00:40:38.076 --> 00:40:39.763
how galaxies evolve,
and so forth,

00:40:39.763 --> 00:40:40.989
this is useful,
too.

00:40:40.989 --> 00:40:44.118
There's actually a big debate
over whether you totally set the

00:40:44.118 --> 00:40:46.170
thing up to do nothing but
supernovae,

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.139
or whether you sort of
generalize it and spend half

00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:52.581
your time doing other things.
And there's one other project,

00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:55.731
at least, which I'll describe
next week, that these guys are

00:40:55.731 --> 00:40:58.483
interested in doing,
but there's a real tradeoff

00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:01.475
between making it a general
purpose telescope like the

00:41:01.475 --> 00:41:03.908
Hubble,
or doing this one thing

00:41:03.908 --> 00:41:06.215
especially well.
And that's, you know,

00:41:06.215 --> 00:41:08.550
the kind of thing that's
currently under discussion.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:13.572
So, SNAP is one example of
where people might go in the

00:41:13.572 --> 00:41:19.127
future.
Another is a ground-based

00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:28.940
project called the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.490
This is otherwise known as LSST.
LSST.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.445
The plan is this.
And this has a lot of other

00:41:36.445 --> 00:41:42.408
science besides this.
It's going to do a full survey

00:41:42.408 --> 00:41:48.000
of the sky every three days.
So, it's going to--every three

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.639
nights, it marches across the
entire sky, takes a really deep

00:41:50.639 --> 00:41:55.564
image of the sky.
And so, the consequence of this

00:41:55.564 --> 00:42:02.869
for cosmology is that you find
every low and intermediate

00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:09.468
redshift supernova.
That's tens to hundreds of

00:42:09.468 --> 00:42:17.500
thousands--tens of--maybe 10,000
a year, approximately.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.500
So, you find lots of these
things.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.938
So, first of all,
you build up incredible

00:42:21.938 --> 00:42:24.619
statistics out to a redshift of
about 1/2.

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:31.760
So, huge statistics to Z
of about 1/2.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.260
That's kind of where its limit
is going to kick in.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:43.647
And you also can study the
details of sub-classes of

00:42:43.647 --> 00:42:47.235
supernovae.
So, this is important,

00:42:47.235 --> 00:42:49.573
because you know if you're
fooling yourself,

00:42:49.573 --> 00:42:51.965
because the distant supernovae
are different,

00:42:51.965 --> 00:42:54.140
somehow, from the local
supernovae.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.270
They're fainter for some reason.
But in the local sample,

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.090
only one in 100 is of the faint
kind.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.763
If you've got 10,000,
that means you've got,

00:43:02.763 --> 00:43:06.057
you know, a sample of 100 of
the weird subclass that's

00:43:06.057 --> 00:43:08.755
causing you trouble.
So, this will be hugely

00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:11.848
helpful, not only in beating
down the statistics so that you

00:43:11.848 --> 00:43:14.889
can tell the difference between
lines that are really quite

00:43:14.889 --> 00:43:17.717
close to each other,
theoretical predictions that

00:43:17.717 --> 00:43:20.373
are close to each other,
but it also will test the

00:43:20.373 --> 00:43:23.462
systematic problems that you
might have different kinds of

00:43:23.462 --> 00:43:26.930
supernovae and generally enhance
your overall confidence that you

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:30.934
know what you're talking about.
Also, these kinds of sky

00:43:30.934 --> 00:43:36.199
surveys are of benefit for many,
many other fields of astronomy.

00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:40.130
The issue with this is the
following statistic.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:46.950
Thirty terabytes of data per
night, right?

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:53.369
That's 30,000 gig per night.
Thirty million megabytes every

00:43:53.369 --> 00:43:55.839
night.
And so, this is not something

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:58.772
that us normal astronomers can
handle, and so,

00:43:58.772 --> 00:44:02.552
the recent news from the LSST
project is, Google has joined

00:44:02.552 --> 00:44:05.811
the project.
And so, we're bringing in

00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:09.039
the--yeah, right.
We're bringing in the big boys

00:44:09.039 --> 00:44:11.447
for this.
And I think this is kind of

00:44:11.447 --> 00:44:13.090
Google Universe,
right?

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.943
Because it's a--you know,
you take all--you do this for a

00:44:16.943 --> 00:44:20.039
few years, and you've done 100
sky surveys.

00:44:20.039 --> 00:44:23.159
You can then add them all up
and get incredibly deep data.

00:44:23.159 --> 00:44:26.735
And so, I guess Google figured,
you know, if somebody's going

00:44:26.735 --> 00:44:29.953
to be piling up a catalog of the
entire known Universe,

00:44:29.953 --> 00:44:33.604
they'd better be a part of it.
And it's fortunate for us,

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:37.351
because they're probably the
only people in the world who can

00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:40.599
create a database of data coming
in at this rate.

00:44:40.599 --> 00:44:43.430
And, I should say,
keep in mind that you have to

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:47.165
actually, not just acquire this
data, you have to actually look

00:44:47.165 --> 00:44:50.022
at it each night.
Because you've got to actually

00:44:50.022 --> 00:44:53.207
discover these supernovae in
real time, because they're going

00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:56.179
to be gone three weeks from now,
or three months now.

00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:58.676
And so, you not only have to
pile up 30 terabytes of data

00:44:58.676 --> 00:45:01.261
every night, you've got to
actually look at it and find all

00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:03.594
the interesting objects.
So - Student:

00:45:03.594 --> 00:45:05.329
[Inaudible]
can they do it for?

00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:06.906
Professor Charles
Bailyn: The plan,

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:09.135
currently, is to operate for at
least five and probably ten

00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:10.900
years.
They have a site picked out.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.629
They're going to put it down in
Chile, actually,

00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:16.300
on the mountain where our tiny
telescope is.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.814
And so, we actually like this,
because they'll pay for some of

00:45:19.814 --> 00:45:22.465
the infrastructure costs down
there--hopefully,

00:45:22.465 --> 00:45:24.769
for all of the infrastructure
costs.

00:45:24.769 --> 00:45:27.280
But negotiation's still in
progress.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.610
And they have a whole design
planned for this.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.207
It's all ready to go,
but it's going to cost a fair

00:45:34.207 --> 00:45:37.322
amount of money to build.
And what's even more important:

00:45:37.322 --> 00:45:40.251
it's going to cost an enormous
amount of money to run,

00:45:40.251 --> 00:45:42.846
just on a night-to-night basis.
So, actually,

00:45:42.846 --> 00:45:46.099
the construction costs of the
telescope are not the dominant

00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:48.197
cost.
The dominant costs are building

00:45:48.197 --> 00:45:50.230
the software and running the
program.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.157
And it turns out,
that's harder to get some rich

00:45:54.157 --> 00:45:57.250
guy to give you a $100,000,000
for.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:01.034
And it's ground-based,
so it doesn't fall into the

00:46:01.034 --> 00:46:03.449
NASA category.
And so, it isn't clear where

00:46:03.449 --> 00:46:05.858
the money is going to come from.
They actually have a fair

00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:07.570
amount of private money already
piled up.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.719
And, as I say,
they have detailed,

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:13.409
elaborate plans for this thing.
You can look at their website.

00:46:13.409 --> 00:46:15.163
In fact, you will have to look
at their website,

00:46:15.163 --> 00:46:17.139
because that's going to be part
of the problem set.

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:22.871
And so, these are two of the
projects, which are currently

00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:27.900
being designed and hopefully
soon will be built,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.245
that are going to try and push
this a little further and try

00:46:32.245 --> 00:46:36.958
and find out more about the dark
energy than simply the fact that

00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:43.030
it exists.
Okay, let me put back up this

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:50.340

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.818
Professor Paul Bloom:
So what we're doing today is

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:17.440
continuing on the theme of
emotions.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.232
"Emotions" is a two-part
lecture and we're continuing

00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:25.155
along certain themes.
I want to begin by responding

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:29.645
to a question which was raised
in the last class concerning

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:33.560
smiling and nonhuman primates.
It was a very good question.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.031
The issue was:
we know that humans have

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.479
different sorts of smiles to
convey different sorts of

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.617
information.
The question was,

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:45.040
"do nonhuman primates,
like chimpanzees or gorillas or

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.140
gibbons, have the same many
sorts of smiles?"

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.927
So, I contacted the world's
expert on smiling,

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:54.782
who did not return my e-mails.
So, I contacted the second

00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:59.320
world's expert on smiling who
told me that the answer is "no,"

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.085
that primate--nonhuman primate
smiles actually correspond

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.490
almost entirely to appeasement
smiles.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.485
They're "don't hurt me" smiles.
They're equivalent to the "coy

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:15.909
smile" that we saw on humans.
But that nonhuman primates do

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.733
not use smiles for greetings;
there's no equivalent to the

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.500
"greeting smile" or "Pan Am
smile";

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.950
nor do they use them as genuine
expressions of happiness.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.140
There's no equivalent to the
"Duchenne smile."

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.325
That's as far as I know.
If the world's expert gets back

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:33.740
to me and says something
different, I'll keep you posted.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.098
Another thing.
Going back to the beginning

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:39.070
theme of the class,
what we started--just to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.959
review, we talked about the
different functions of emotions.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.959
And then we talked about
smiling and facial expressions.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.873
And then we turned to some--to
a nonsocial emotion,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.496
the case of fear.
And then we shifted to social

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:52.420
emotions.
And we talked about social

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.438
emotions towards kin and the
special evolutionary reasons

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:59.159
that would lead them to evolve.
And as we were ending,

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.882
we were talking about the
relationship between an animal

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:07.527
and its children,
particularly in cases like

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.900
humans and birds and mammals
where there tends to be a close

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.782
relationship with our children.
We invest in quality,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:18.866
not quantity.
I might produce very few

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:23.199
children in my life.
And my evolutionary trick then

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:28.220
is to focus very intently on
them and make sure they survive.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.730
If I were to produce 100
children, I could stand to lose

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.369
a few, but if I just produce
five in my lifetime or two or

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.690
one,
they become very precious to me.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.532
And so, the story of the
evolution of a species like us

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:44.734
involves a long period of
dependence and deep,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:48.150
deep bonds between the parent
and the child.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.743
And that's part of what I
talked about,

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.169
how parents respond to
children.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.205
And I want to begin this class
by giving an illustration from a

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:58.460
documentary about parental
response to children,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.540
but I want to give it in a
species that's not us.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.747
And here is why.
I'll explain why with an

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:07.995
analogy.
I have a friend of mine who

00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:10.150
studies the psychology of
religion.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.719
He studies why people hold
religious beliefs.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.523
And he tells me that when he's
talking to a non specialist,

00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:20.062
somebody not in the field,
he doesn't ever tell them,

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:24.122
"Yeah, I'm really interested in
why people believe in the Bible

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:28.116
or why people light the candles
on Sabbath or why people go to

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:31.586
church" because these are
religions that people around

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.146
here hold,
and if you tell people you

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:37.483
study them they'll sort of be
puzzled, "why would you want to

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.819
study something like that" or
offended.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.841
If you want to talk about the
psychology of religion to an

00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:45.384
audience like this,
what you do is you start with

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:48.081
the exotic.
So, you start by talking about

00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:50.490
people who put butter on their
heads.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.262
Dan Sperber talks about a
culture where the men put butter

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:56.559
on their heads in the summer.
And it kind of melts and that's

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.964
part of--one of the things that
they do or--you talk about a

00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:03.370
culture that believes in spirits
or that trees can talk.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.089
You say you're studying it and
they say, "Oh,

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:07.400
that's interesting.
I wonder why they believe that?"

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.319
And you use that as a way to
look at more general facts that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.338
exist even in our culture.
You use the fact that we don't

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:19.798
take the exotic for granted as a
way to motivate the scientific

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:22.819
study of things we do take for
granted.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.129
And this is,
of course, true more generally.

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.796
This was the point in the
William James quote when he

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:30.770
talked about things that are
natural to us and noticed that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.949
some very odd things are equally
natural to other species.

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.167
And it's true,
I think, in particular when we

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:39.139
talk about things like the love
we have for our children.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.347
So, one way to look at the love
we have for our children

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:45.029
scientifically,
isn't to look at it head-on,

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.036
because the love we feel
towards our own children feels

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:51.680
sacred, it feels special,
but look at it in other species.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.365
And so, one of the nicest
illustrations of this is the

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:58.077
Emperor penguin,
which was--which--whose

00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:02.249
childcare and mating practices
were dramatized in a wonderful

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.240
movie called "March of the
Penguins."

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.273
And this is interesting because
they had this incredibly

00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:13.746
elaborate and quite precarious
system of generating and taking

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.966
care of offspring.
So, I want to show you a brief

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.750
clip of the movie to illustrate
some parts of this.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.296
What they do at the beginning,
which is not--which leads up to

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:26.668
this, is they take a very long
trek from the water to their

00:05:26.668 --> 00:05:29.443
breeding grounds.
Their breeding grounds is--are

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:32.394
protected from the wind and
they're on a firm piece of ice

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.310
so they could hold the whole
pack.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.755
They do the breeding there and
it's there that the eggs are

00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:41.397
created.
So, this is where the movie

00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:46.148
begins at this point.
"March of the Penguins" was the

00:05:46.148 --> 00:05:50.245
second best--second most popular
documentary of all time,

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:52.879
beaten only by "Fahrenheit
9/11."

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.829
And people responded to it in
different ways,

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:59.851
which are informative when we
think about the generalizations

00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:03.740
you could make from animal
behavior to human behavior.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.954
Some conservative commentators
saw this as a celebration of

00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:12.551
family values,
such as love and trust and

00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:14.737
monogamy.
Some liberals,

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:18.444
who hate everything that's good
and true, [laughter]

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.770
responded by saying,
"Well, yeah,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.260
they're monogamous for one
breeding season.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.522
It's a year.
Then they go and find another

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:28.529
mate.
If you add it up,

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.480
it's pretty slutty."
[laughter]

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.514
I think more to the point,
people were impressed and

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:39.311
stunned by the rich and
articulate and systematic

00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:42.949
behavior that these animals were
showing.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.164
Plainly, they didn't pick it up
from television,

00:06:45.164 --> 00:06:46.860
movies, culture,
learning, schooling,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.451
and so on.
To some extent,

00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:51.930
this sort of complicated
behavior came natural to them.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.059
And it's understandable that
some proponents of intelligent

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:00.006
design, or creationism,
pointed to this as an example

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:04.564
of how God creates things that
are deeply, richly intricate so

00:07:04.564 --> 00:07:08.600
as to perpetrate the survival of
different animals.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.835
From a Darwinian standpoint,
the Darwinian would agree with

00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:14.624
the creationist that this
couldn't have happened by

00:07:14.624 --> 00:07:16.719
accident,
this is just far too

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.827
complicated, but would appeal to
the--to this as an exquisite

00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:23.430
example of a biological
adaptation,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.519
in particular a biological
adaptation regarding parental

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:31.831
care to children shaped by the
fact that children share the

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:35.771
parents' genes and so parents
will evolve in ways that

00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:39.339
perpetrate the survival of their
children.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:43.914
Then there's the other
direction, which is how children

00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:48.150
respond to parents,
how the young ones are wired up

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.725
to resonate and respond in
different ways to the adults

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.815
around them.
And we quickly talked about

00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:59.737
some different theories of this.
And I'll just review what we

00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:03.219
talked about last class.
Babies will develop an

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:05.829
attachment to whoever is
closest.

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:09.023
They'll usually prefer their
mothers because their mothers

00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:11.600
are typically those who are
closest to them.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.529
They'll prefer her voice,
her face, her smell.

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:18.212
It used to be thought that
there is some sort of magical

00:08:18.212 --> 00:08:21.560
moment of imprinting that when
the baby is born,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.065
the baby must see his or her
mother and "boom," a connection

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:26.646
is made.
If the baby doesn't,

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:29.310
terrible things will happen
with attachment later on.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.273
This is silly.
There is no reason to believe

00:08:32.273 --> 00:08:35.709
there's some special moment or
special five minutes or special

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.943
hour.
It's just in the fullness of

00:08:37.943 --> 00:08:41.637
time babies will develop an
attachment to the animal that's

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:44.369
closest to it.
They will recognize it as,

00:08:44.369 --> 00:08:47.224
at an implicit level,
at an unconscious level,

00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:50.789
as their kin.
Well, how does this work?

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:54.367
How does the baby's brain
develop--come to develop an

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.120
emotional attachment to that
creature?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.697
Well, you remember from Skinner
that operant conditioning could

00:09:01.697 --> 00:09:05.497
provide a good answer to this.
And this is known as the

00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:08.912
"Cupboard Theory," which is
babies love their moms because

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:12.230
their moms provide food.
It's the law of effect.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.998
It's operant conditioning.
They will approach their

00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:17.330
mothers to get the food from
them.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.405
And they will develop an
attachment because their mother

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:23.595
provides food.
And this is contrasted with a

00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:27.077
more nativist,
hard-wired theory developed by

00:09:27.077 --> 00:09:31.509
Bowlby which claims that there's
two things going on.

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:36.081
There is a draw to mom for
comfort and social interaction

00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:39.890
and fear of strangers.
Now, in the real world,

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.477
it's difficult to pull apart
these two means of attraction

00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:48.903
because the very same woman
who's giving you comfort and

00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:53.409
social interaction is also the
one giving you milk.

00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:56.870
But in the laboratory you can
pull them apart.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.046
And that's what Henry Harlow
did in the movies you saw last

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:02.501
week.
So, Harlow exposed primates to

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:06.010
two different mothers.
One is a wire mother.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.940
That's a Skinnerian mother.
That's a mother who gave food.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.735
The other is a cloth mother
set-up so that she'd be

00:10:12.735 --> 00:10:16.000
comfortable and give warmth and
cuddling.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.929
And the question is,
"Which one do babies go for?"

00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:21.823
And as you can remember from
the movies, the results are

00:10:21.823 --> 00:10:25.130
fairly decisive.
Babies go to the wire mother to

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.394
eat--as one of the characters
said, "You've got to eat to

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:32.914
live."
But they viewed the--they loved

00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:36.419
the cloth mother.
They developed an attachment to

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.484
the warm, cuddly mother.
That's the one they used as a

00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.843
base when they were threatened.
That's the one they used as a

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:48.279
base from which to explore.
Okay.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:52.379
And that actually--Oh,
that's just--I have a picture.

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:56.409
And that actually takes me to
the--Oh, except for one thing,

00:10:56.409 --> 00:11:00.507
it almost takes me to the end
of the question of our emotions

00:11:00.507 --> 00:11:03.520
towards kin.
One question you could ask is,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.889
"What if there's no contact at
all?"

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:11.433
Now, you could imagine the
effects of how--A lot of people

00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:17.171
are interested in the question
of the effects of the child's

00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:22.616
early relationship to adults
around him or her in how the

00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:27.341
child turns out later.
This becomes hugely relevant

00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:30.773
for social debates like daycare.
So for instance,

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:34.328
a lot of psychologists are
interested in the question,

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:37.950
"Is it better for a child to be
raised by a parent,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.897
usually a mother,
or does it make a difference if

00:11:41.897 --> 00:11:45.439
the child goes to daycare?
What if the child goes to

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.766
daycare at six months?
What if the child goes to

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:50.769
daycare at two years?
How does this affect the child?"

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:55.529
The short answer is,
nobody really knows.

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:58.554
There's a lot of debate over
whether or not there are subtle

00:11:58.554 --> 00:12:00.809
differences and it's deeply
controversial.

00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:04.220
But we do know that it doesn't
make a big difference.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.187
We do know that if you got
raised by mom,

00:12:07.187 --> 00:12:11.045
or perhaps mom and dad,
or maybe just dad all through

00:12:11.045 --> 00:12:15.422
your life until going off for
school and I--my parents threw

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:19.874
me in a daycare at age three
months--it's not going to make a

00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:23.246
big difference for us,
maybe a subtle difference

00:12:23.246 --> 00:12:25.309
though it's not clear which way
it would go.

00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:26.970
But it won't make a big
difference.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.340
But what if there's no contact
at all?

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.457
What if--What about terrible
circumstances where people get

00:12:34.457 --> 00:12:38.870
no cloth mother,
they get nobody for attachment?

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.504
This is a really--In the real
world, of course,

00:12:42.504 --> 00:12:45.269
you can't do experiments on
this.

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:48.807
And in the real world with
humans, this only happens in

00:12:48.807 --> 00:12:52.330
tragic cases.
But this has been studied.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.701
So Harlow, again,
raised monkeys in solitary

00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:05.445
confinement so they were raised
in steel cages with only a wire

00:13:05.445 --> 00:13:07.731
mother.
In other words,

00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:10.950
they got all the nutrition they
needed but they got no

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.994
mothering.
It turned out that you kind of

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:19.590
get monkey psychotics.
They're withdrawn.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.750
They don't play.
They bite themselves.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.320
They're incompetent sexually.
They're incompetent socially.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.007
They're incompetent maternally.
In one case,

00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:32.919
one of these monkeys raised in
solitary confinement was

00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:37.074
artificially inseminated.
When she had a child she banged

00:13:37.074 --> 00:13:41.169
its head on the floor and then
bit it to death.

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:46.058
So, you need to be--you
need--This shows--This is kind

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:51.039
of a stark demonstration that
some early connection,

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:55.095
some early attachment is
critical for the developing of a

00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:57.932
primate.
Obviously, you don't do these

00:13:57.932 --> 00:14:02.230
experiments with people but
there are natural experiments,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.324
humans raised in harsh
orphanages with little social

00:14:06.324 --> 00:14:10.659
contact, and these children--If
the--In other words,

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.449
they get fed,
barely, but nobody picks them

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:15.962
up and cuddles them.
These children,

00:14:15.962 --> 00:14:19.821
if this happens for long
enough, they end up with severe

00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:23.330
problems with social and
emotional development.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.500
From an emotional point of
view, they're often insatiable.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.336
They really need cuddling and
support or they're apathetic,

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:33.847
they don't care at all.
Now, there's some sort of good

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:37.561
news, which is if you get these
people or these monkeys early

00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:41.399
enough you can reverse the
effects of this bad development.

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:45.240
So, there's some research done
with monkey therapists.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.028
So then, what they do is they
take the monkey,

00:14:47.028 --> 00:14:49.330
they raise it in a steel cage,
the monkey comes out,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.274
the monkey is kind of psycho,
and then they send in a younger

00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:54.090
monkey who is just goofing
around,

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.950
jumping all around the place
and everything.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.936
And experience with this
younger monkey who just follows

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:05.429
them around and clings to them
leads to gradual improvement.

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:08.840
It makes the solitary monkey
become better.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.799
There might be a similar effect
with humans.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:15.559
So one story more about--of an
anecdote than an experiment was

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:18.580
a situation where at the age of
one and a half,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.789
children were taken away from a
really harsh orphanage where

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:26.714
they had no contact and brought
into a home for mentally

00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:31.209
retarded women where these women
gave them plenty of contact and

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:34.437
cuddling and apparently,
from what we know,

00:15:34.437 --> 00:15:38.111
brought them back to normal.
And this is all I want to talk

00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:41.250
about, about the emotions we
feel towards our kin,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.390
towards our children,
and towards our parents.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.700
Any questions or thoughts?

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.659
Yes.
Student: Do children in

00:15:56.659 --> 00:15:59.592
orphanages comfort each other?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:01.581
It's a good question.
Do children in orphanages

00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:04.269
comfort each other?
I don't know.

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:07.098
The situation probably wouldn't
be there--The problem is

00:16:07.098 --> 00:16:10.082
children in orphanages who are
in these terrible situations

00:16:10.082 --> 00:16:13.116
tend to be babies and very young
and they wouldn't be thrown

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:16.460
together in situations where
they could comfort each other.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.230
It's a really interesting
question.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.284
What if it was a situation
where children were raised

00:16:21.284 --> 00:16:23.809
without a supportive cloth
mother at all,

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:25.939
would not be able to pick them
up and hold them,

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:28.386
but they could play amongst
themselves and support each

00:16:28.386 --> 00:16:31.200
other?
I don't know the answer to that.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.973
Teaching Assistant: Yes.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:16:33.973 --> 00:16:35.379
Yes?
Is there evidence on that?

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:37.610
Teaching Assistant: Yes,
there is.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.343
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:40.294
Yes.
[laughter]

00:16:40.294 --> 00:16:43.031
The answer is there is
evidence, [laughs]

00:16:43.031 --> 00:16:45.015
as everybody knows,
[laughter]

00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:47.889
that this sort of--amongst the
young,

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:52.960
support can actually help the
monkey and the children.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.730
Somebody else had a question
here?

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.424
Yes.
Student: What does that

00:17:00.424 --> 00:17:03.876
tell us about the middle ground,
if the parent is comforting

00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:06.859
just a little bit and then not
that much [inaudible]

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.200
Professor Paul Bloom:
Right.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.436
So this is--The question is,
"What does that tell us about

00:17:11.436 --> 00:17:13.820
the middle ground?"
So this is an extreme case but

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.849
what do we know about the middle
case?

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.146
Say your parent--You're not
raised in a cage,

00:17:18.146 --> 00:17:21.069
you're not in a Romanian
orphanage, but your parents just

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.640
don't pick you up very much.
They don't love you very much.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.339
There's no good evidence that
that has any effect on a person.

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:31.516
The problem is,
and we're going to talk about

00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:33.890
this in much more detail in a
couple of weeks,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.979
is it's true that parents who
aren't affectionate have kids

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:42.069
that aren't affectionate but
it's not clear this is because

00:17:42.069 --> 00:17:46.230
of a genetic connection or an
environmental connection.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.312
The one thing we do know is
that in the middle ground,

00:17:49.312 --> 00:17:51.289
effects tend not to be
dramatic.

00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:53.727
So when you get away from
extreme cases,

00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:57.164
effects are hard to see and
require careful experimental

00:17:57.164 --> 00:18:00.489
research to tease out.
I think what it's safe to say

00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:03.772
for a lot--for everything but
the severe conditions is we

00:18:03.772 --> 00:18:06.410
don't know what kind of effects
there are.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.370
But if there are effects they
are not big and dramatic ones.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.757
Okay.
Animals' good feelings,

00:18:17.757 --> 00:18:20.748
animals' emotional attraction
to their kin,

00:18:20.748 --> 00:18:24.950
is not a huge puzzle from an
evolutionary point of view.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:30.911
Evolution is driven by forces
that operate on the fact of how

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:35.880
many genes get reproduced and
replicated among your

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.529
descendants.
So, it makes sense that animals

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:42.319
would be wired-up to care for
their kids.

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:45.879
It would make sense that kids
who are wired-up to survive

00:18:45.879 --> 00:18:48.740
would develop attachments to
their parents.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.504
What's more of a puzzle though
is that animals,

00:18:52.504 --> 00:18:55.860
including humans,
seem to have exquisitely

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.380
complicated relationships with
non-kin.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.640
In particular,
animals are nice to non-kin.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.029
You are nice to people that
you're not related to.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.490
There are a lot of examples of
this.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.194
Animals groom one another.
You go, you pick off the lice

00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:15.730
and the bugs off your friend;
they pick it off you.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:21.400
They give warning cries.
So, warning cries--All sorts of

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.650
animals give warning cries.
You are--I don't know.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.469
You're a little animal and a
big animal comes charging and

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:31.650
you say, "Hey!"
Oh.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.029
You may sort of cry and
everybody runs away.

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:37.244
And that's very risky for you
but you do it anyway,

00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:40.330
often to protect people you
aren't related to.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.754
Often animals share childcare.
And from a cold-blooded,

00:19:44.754 --> 00:19:47.545
natural selection,
survival-of-the-gene point of

00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:49.948
view,
you would imagine that if you

00:19:49.948 --> 00:19:53.871
lend me your kid for the day I
would eat him for the protein

00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:57.528
and "it's not my genes and
actually it gives more for my

00:19:57.528 --> 00:19:59.929
kids."
That's not quite how it works

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:03.670
though.
Animals share food.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.908
In fact, that animal,
hugely ugly,

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:11.890
the vampire bat,
shares food.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.213
What happens is the vampire
bat--vampire bats live in caves

00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:19.696
and they fly out.
And what they do is often a bat

00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:22.537
will strike it big.
She'll find a horse,

00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:24.648
for instance,
bite the horse,

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:27.890
pump in tons of blood and then
fly back.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.470
And what it does is it doesn't
keep it to itself.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.349
Rather, it goes around the
whole cave and vomits blood into

00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:37.760
the mouth of all the other
vampire bats so everybody

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.619
benefits.
Isn't that nice?

00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:45.506
[laughter]
Now, what you're tempted to say

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:49.591
is, "Well, that's really nice.
Everybody benefits," but this

00:20:49.591 --> 00:20:52.940
raises a puzzle from the
evolutionary point of view.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.346
Remember, animals benefit more,
and to this situation,

00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:02.750
animals benefit more by working
together than by working alone.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.917
The benefits outweigh the costs.
This is known as "reciprocal

00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:11.210
altruism" meaning my behavior to
you, my good behavior to you,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.241
my altruism for you,
is predicated on the idea of

00:21:14.241 --> 00:21:16.829
reciprocation,
"I'll benefit from you."

00:21:16.829 --> 00:21:19.456
And you imagine how vampire
bats, for instance,

00:21:19.456 --> 00:21:22.595
why this makes sense.
This is--If you're a vampire

00:21:22.595 --> 00:21:26.506
bat, it's a better system when
anybody strikes it big to feed

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:29.700
you rather than for anybody who
strike it big,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.460
use the blood and then spit out
all the rest of it.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.970
But here's the problem.
Here's why it's such a puzzle.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.259
The problem is the existence of
cheaters.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:43.607
And in economics and sociology
these are also known as

00:21:43.607 --> 00:21:47.160
"free-riders."
And what a cheater or

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.346
free-rider does is it takes the
benefits without paying the

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.089
cost.
Imagine two genes.

00:21:56.089 --> 00:22:00.625
Imagine one builds a vampire
bat that accepts blood from

00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:04.941
others and shares blood.
The other gene accepts blood

00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:07.809
from others and doesn't share
blood.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:11.856
In the long run,
"B" will actually out-produce

00:22:11.856 --> 00:22:16.892
gene "A" because in fact,
"B" will be healthy while other

00:22:16.892 --> 00:22:21.761
vampire bats get sick.
And then so the offspring will

00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:24.946
do better.
An even sharper example is an

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:28.508
example of warning cries.
So, gophers give warning cries

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:31.651
when there's a predator.
It is extremely adaptive to

00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:34.319
give a warning cry.
Sorry.

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:37.049
It's extremely adaptive to
respond to a warning cry.

00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:39.500
You hear a warning cry,
you-- "Oh, crap," you run away.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:45.680
It is not very adaptive to give
a warning cry.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.993
A really good solution then is
to listen to warning cries but

00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:53.911
not to give them.
Suppose we had a system--It is

00:22:53.911 --> 00:22:57.823
very adaptive when people are
going to the bar,

00:22:57.823 --> 00:23:01.819
when people buy drinks to
accept the drinks.

00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:05.696
It is not so adaptive,
from the standpoint of one's

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:09.150
wallet, to buy people drinks.
Here is a solution.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.089
Accept drinks but don't pay for
drinks.

00:23:12.089 --> 00:23:16.499
And if everybody fell to that
solution, the idea of buying a

00:23:16.499 --> 00:23:19.109
round would fade.
So, there is the puzzle.

00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:22.557
Since cheating--Since a
cheater, in the short run,

00:23:22.557 --> 00:23:26.076
can always out-win--does better
than a non-cheater,

00:23:26.076 --> 00:23:28.750
how could this cooperation
evolve?

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.559
How could it be an
evolutionarily stable strategy?

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:35.450
And the answer is "cheater
detection."

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.317
Reciprocal altruism can only
evolve if animals are wired up

00:23:40.317 --> 00:23:44.162
to punish cheaters.
Now, that requires a lot of

00:23:44.162 --> 00:23:46.951
mental apparatus.
You have to recognize cheaters,

00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:49.710
you have to remember cheaters,
and you have to be motivated to

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.372
punish cheaters.
And not every animal has this

00:23:53.372 --> 00:23:58.783
degree of complicated apparatus
but actually we know that

00:23:58.783 --> 00:24:02.689
vampire bats do.
So, in one clever study--So the

00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:05.960
theory says--the evolutionary
theory says "yeah,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.917
I see what these vampire bats
are doing," but you see--and

00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:11.926
this is a case where evolution
makes a nice prediction that

00:24:11.926 --> 00:24:14.519
couldn't evolve unless bats are
keeping track.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:18.054
If bats aren't keeping track,
then the system could never

00:24:18.054 --> 00:24:21.400
exist because the cheaters would
just take it over.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.450
They must be watching for
cheaters.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.493
So, the experiment which was
done is you--a vampire bat

00:24:27.493 --> 00:24:29.890
strikes it big,
it flies back,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.479
and then you keep it--as a
scientist you keep it from

00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:38.339
giving blood to anybody else.
Then what happens?

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:43.172
Well, what happens is when the
other bats strike it big they

00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:47.727
starve the selfish bat,
just as if we go to bars and

00:24:47.727 --> 00:24:51.130
everybody buys a round except
for me.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.670
And this happens over and over
and over again.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.125
Pretty soon you're going to buy
a round but you're not going to

00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:58.088
give me one.
And so, just as humans are

00:24:58.088 --> 00:25:00.852
keeping their eyes out for
people who are taking the

00:25:00.852 --> 00:25:04.049
benefits without paying the
costs, so are other animals.

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:09.856
And it is argued that this
sensitivity to cheating,

00:25:09.856 --> 00:25:15.512
this focus on reciprocation,
plays a powerful role in the

00:25:15.512 --> 00:25:19.779
evolution of social behavior and
the evolution of social

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:23.576
emotions.
And a classic illustration of

00:25:23.576 --> 00:25:27.551
this is The Prisoner's Dilemma.
Now, many of you,

00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:30.131
I think, have seen The
Prisoner's Dilemma in one course

00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:32.829
or another?
It shows up--It is one of the

00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:35.630
main constructs in the social
sciences.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.162
It shows up in cognitive
science, psychology,

00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:41.501
economics, that you could--The
teaching fellows are passing

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:45.069
around something which you're
not going to use right away.

00:25:45.069 --> 00:25:47.833
But for some of you this is the
first time you're going to be

00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:50.550
exposed to The Prisoner's
Dilemma so let me spell it out.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:56.680
Here's the idea.
You and a friend commit a crime.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.803
You rob a bank, for instance.
For the sake of this example,

00:26:00.803 --> 00:26:05.009
you are prisoner two.
You get caught.

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:08.860
The police put you in a little
room and they say,

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.390
"We want to know everything
that happened.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.978
In particular,
we want you to rat out your

00:26:14.978 --> 00:26:17.814
friend."
Now, here are the options,

00:26:17.814 --> 00:26:21.799
and one thing about this is
nothing is hidden.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:24.523
The police officer could
actually print out a copy of The

00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:27.150
Prisoner's Dilemma and put it
right in front of you.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.860
And what he could say is,
"Look."

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.292
You're prisoner two.
"You could cooperate--Well,

00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:37.859
you have two options.
You could either cooperate with

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:42.178
your friend, you could stay
silent, or you could defect or

00:26:42.178 --> 00:26:46.218
you could squeal."
But the police officer says,

00:26:46.218 --> 00:26:49.346
"Look.
If you--Let me tell you

00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:52.748
something.
If you cooperate with your

00:26:52.748 --> 00:26:57.569
friend and he squeals on you,
you'll go to prison for life

00:26:57.569 --> 00:27:02.528
and he'll walk out.
However, if you squeal on him

00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:06.054
and he cooperates,
he keeps quiet,

00:27:06.054 --> 00:27:11.610
he'll go to prison for life and
you'll walk out."

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.105
So, what do you do?
Now, on the nice side,

00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:17.260
what you can do is you could
say, "No.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.359
I'm going to be quiet.
I'm going to cooperate."

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:23.195
Now, if you could trust your
friend to cooperate,

00:27:23.195 --> 00:27:25.677
you're fine,
you each get a little stint in

00:27:25.677 --> 00:27:28.690
prison, but of course your
friend might defect.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:34.096
Your friend might squeal.
Here is the important structure

00:27:34.096 --> 00:27:38.779
of The Prisoner's Dilemma.
No matter what you--what your

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:43.070
friend chooses to do,
you're better off squealing.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.209
So, suppose you're prisoner two.
You believe your friend's going

00:27:47.209 --> 00:27:49.686
to cooperate with you.
He's not going to be--he's not

00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:51.140
going to give the information
out.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.220
Well, then your best thing to
do is squeal on him.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.130
What if you believe he's going
to squeal on you?

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.856
Well, your best thing to do is
squeal on him but if you could

00:28:04.856 --> 00:28:09.109
get your act together and you
could coordinate this,

00:28:09.109 --> 00:28:13.539
you would both be quiet and get
a fairly minor penalty.

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:16.558
And you could see this--This is
the standard origin of the

00:28:16.558 --> 00:28:19.042
prisoner's dilemma,
why it's called "The Prisoner's

00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:21.390
Dilemma," but you could see this
all over the place.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.458
So, here is the logic.
The best case for you is to

00:28:25.458 --> 00:28:28.799
defect while the other person
cooperates.

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:32.430
The worst case is to cooperate
while the other person defects.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.877
Back to the police thing.
The best case for you is to

00:28:34.877 --> 00:28:37.270
give up all the information;
the other guy stays silent;

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.380
you cut a deal;
you walk home that day.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.435
The worst case is you're quiet,
he cuts a deal,

00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:46.022
you go to prison for life,
but overall the best is that

00:28:46.022 --> 00:28:49.676
each cooperate and overall the
worst for both is if each

00:28:49.676 --> 00:28:52.353
defect.
And the reason that makes this

00:28:52.353 --> 00:28:55.160
tragic is this.
Regardless of what your

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.720
opponent does,
it pays to defect,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.559
but if both people defect both
are worse off.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.850
I'll give a couple of other
examples.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.612
No.
That's just to show that

00:29:05.612 --> 00:29:08.470
there's a cartoon corresponding
to The Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.440
It is that common.
Here's the idea.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.740
I am--I break up with my wife.
We've been married for a while.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.939
We've decided we're not going
to go through it together

00:29:19.939 --> 00:29:23.173
anymore and we break up.
We're living in separate houses

00:29:23.173 --> 00:29:25.140
and we're starting to talk
divorce.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.020
It occurs to me--Here's me.
I put that out there.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.769
"Should I get a divorce lawyer?"
I ask.

00:29:32.769 --> 00:29:36.910
Now, I know divorce lawyers are
really expensive.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.509
And it's kind of difficult to
get a divorce lawyer.

00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:44.055
But if I get a divorce
lawyer--And so neither one of us

00:29:44.055 --> 00:29:47.590
get a divorce lawyer we'll just
do okay.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.485
We'll get a mediator.
We'll split the money down the

00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:51.964
middle.
That'll be okay but I'm kind of

00:29:51.964 --> 00:29:55.087
tempted.
If I get a divorce lawyer and

00:29:55.087 --> 00:30:00.470
she doesn't, my divorce lawyer
will take everything she's got.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.320
I get everything,
she loses everything.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.359
Maybe I should be nice.
Hold it.

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:09.700
What if she gets a divorce
lawyer and I don't?

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.884
Well, then I'll lose
everything, she'll get

00:30:12.884 --> 00:30:16.010
everything.
Well, we should both get a

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:20.210
divorce lawyer then but we'd
both do pretty badly.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.620
Imagine we're two countries,
country "A" and country "B."

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.700
Should I do nuclear disarmament?
That's pretty good.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.580
We'd do okay if both countries
disarmed.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.540
We would live our lives;
we'll raise taxes;

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:37.323
we'll do whatever countries do.
But wouldn't it be cool if I

00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:40.380
build up my weaponry and they
don't?

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.830
I'll invade,
take everything they got.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.269
That's kind of tempting.
Uh oh.

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:47.791
Also, if I don't do anything
and they do it,

00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:50.430
they'll invade my country,
take everything.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.643
So, we both build up our
weaponry and we both do pretty

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.712
badly.
Once you start thinking about

00:30:55.712 --> 00:30:58.184
things this way,
there's no end to the sort of

00:30:58.184 --> 00:31:01.260
notions that could fall under
The Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.838
A good example is a drug deal.
Suppose I want to buy marijuana

00:31:06.838 --> 00:31:12.119
from you, or "reefer" as they
call it on the street.

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:18.385
[laughter]
So, I have $1,000 and from you

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:27.000
I'd like to buy a ton of reefer
so--I'm rounding off.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.231
[laughter]
So, you say,

00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:29.880
"Wonderful.
Wonderful.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.272
Let's meet behind the gym,
two in the morning on Friday,

00:31:33.272 --> 00:31:36.498
and we'll do the exchange.
You bring $1,000,

00:31:36.498 --> 00:31:39.390
I bring the reefer."
"Oh, cool.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.470
Okay.
Good."

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.780
And I think,
"that's pretty good,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.172
a thousand bucks,
I get the reefer,

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:45.064
you get a thousand bucks.
That's okay,

00:31:45.064 --> 00:31:48.880
that's the normal thing."
But now something occurs to me.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.019
"Nobody's going to go to the
cops if things go badly.

00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:56.316
So instead of doing--bringing
the money, why don't I just

00:31:56.316 --> 00:31:58.667
bring a gun?
You come with your reefer,

00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:00.780
I stick a gun in your face,
take the reefer,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.890
go home."
Maybe I won't do that,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.759
but now I worry because you're
thinking the same thing.

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:10.040
So, you could show up with a
gun, stick the gun in my face,

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.020
take the thousand bucks,
go home.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:17.769
I'll have no reefer.
What will I smoke?

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.230
[laughter]
So, we both think this way.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.451
So, we both show up behind the
gym, two in the morning,

00:32:23.451 --> 00:32:25.119
with guns.
[laughter]

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:28.623
Well, that's not as bad for
either one of us if I

00:32:28.623 --> 00:32:32.200
had--I--you had a gun and I
didn't have a gun.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.810
But still, we're both worse off
than if we could cooperate and

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.527
just do the damn trade.
And so that's the structure of

00:32:40.527 --> 00:32:43.816
The Prisoner's Dilemma.
You can only appreciate The

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:46.589
Prisoner's Dilemma by actually
doing it.

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:51.121
So, here's--here is a numerical
equivalent to The Prisoner's

00:32:51.121 --> 00:32:53.707
Dilemma.
Everybody should have a card in

00:32:53.707 --> 00:32:55.289
front of you,
a file card.

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:58.407
If you don't--If you didn't get
a card, a piece of paper will do

00:32:58.407 --> 00:33:02.222
just as well.
Please write on one side

00:33:02.222 --> 00:33:09.519
"cooperate" and on the other
side "defect" and then please

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:15.280
find a partner with whom to play
one game.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.510
This is a one-shot game.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.988
One of you is player one.
The player on the right-most

00:33:40.988 --> 00:33:43.400
side from my right could be
player one.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.819
The other one is player two.
Do you each have a partner?

00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:51.015
If you have three people,
you could cluster together and

00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:54.509
do two and then two and just
think.

00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:57.327
It is actually best if you've
never met or spoken to the

00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:59.119
person you're about to deal
with.

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:04.221
And the game is,
when I say "go," simply show

00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:07.826
the person your choice.
To be clear,

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:10.946
if you are player one and you
cooperate and player two

00:34:10.946 --> 00:34:13.889
cooperates as well,
you each get three dollars.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:18.440
If you are player one and you
cooperate while player two

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.322
defects, player two gets five
dollars and you get bupkis and

00:34:23.322 --> 00:34:27.495
so on.
On three, just show the card to

00:34:27.495 --> 00:34:32.136
your opponent,
to your person you're playing

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:35.520
with.
One, two, three.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:49.432
[laughter] Okay.
How many people in this room

00:34:49.432 --> 00:34:54.900
cooperated?
How many cooperated?

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.170
How many defected?
[laughter] Okay.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.250
How many people are now five
dollars richer?

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.670
Okay.
How many of you got nothing?

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.989
[laughter] Okay.
So, you're learning.

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:13.329
You're learning that the person
next to you is really an SOB.

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:16.869
[laughter]
Now, find the person next to

00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:21.650
you and you get to play again.
And you get to play five games

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:25.987
in a row.
Play five games in a row and

00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:29.631
keep score.
You just show it to each other,

00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:32.002
record the numbers,
show it, show it,

00:35:32.002 --> 00:35:36.679
show it, show it.
Go now.

00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:39.189
[laughter]
Anybody here win twenty-five

00:35:39.189 --> 00:35:42.860
dollars?
Yes, twenty-five?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.617
So you-- Student 1: He
cooperated four times and I

00:35:46.617 --> 00:35:50.173
defected-- Professor Paul
Bloom: That's twenty,

00:35:50.173 --> 00:35:52.270
twenty-one.
[laughter] Okay.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.030
That's good.
That's good.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.409
So, it really is a measure of
honesty.

00:35:56.409 --> 00:35:59.550
[laughs]
Anybody win twenty or more?

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:06.290
Fifteen or more.
Fourteen or less.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:11.820
Anybody do five or less?
You're a good person.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.680
It's good.
It's good.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.420
You played it with him?
Student 2: Yes.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.030
Professor Paul Bloom:
Bad person.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:23.443
[laughter]
It's not really about good or

00:36:23.443 --> 00:36:26.119
bad.
There was a great game once.

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:29.250
It's a simple game,
but it was a great game,

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.599
a great, famous competition a
long time ago,

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:36.652
about 20 years ago,
set up by the great computer

00:36:36.652 --> 00:36:40.323
scientist Robert Axelrod.
And he put together a

00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:44.161
competition where people brought
in computer programs to play

00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:47.039
this game, to play The
Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:48.960
And there were sixty-three
competitors.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.307
And these computer programs
were incredibly--Some of them

00:36:52.307 --> 00:36:54.220
were very simple,
always be nice,

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.030
always be--always cooperate,
always defect.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.452
Some were elegant,
prime number solutions and

00:37:00.452 --> 00:37:04.263
prototype responses,
genetic algorithms crafted to

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:09.320
figure out what the other person
was doing and suss them out.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:16.800
But the winner was developed by
Anatol Rappaport.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.573
And Anatol Rappaport actually
died about a month ago at quite

00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:26.407
an old age, a great scientist.
What was interesting about this

00:37:26.407 --> 00:37:30.982
was he was the winner with his
program but his program was also

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:34.551
one of the simplest.
It may well have been the

00:37:34.551 --> 00:37:37.228
simplest.
It was called "Tit-for-Tat" and

00:37:37.228 --> 00:37:41.376
it worked very simple.
It took four lines of basic

00:37:41.376 --> 00:37:44.205
code.
The first time you meet a new

00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:47.486
program, cooperate.
The first time you meet

00:37:47.486 --> 00:37:51.245
somebody, be nice.
After that, do on each trial

00:37:51.245 --> 00:37:55.380
what the other program did on
the previous trial.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.280
This beat sixty-two others.
And here is why.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.000
It had certain beautiful
features.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.337
It starts friendly.
Remember the best long-term

00:38:05.337 --> 00:38:08.230
solution is everybody's
be--everybody's nice.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.260
It starts off nice but you
can't--it's not a sucker.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.076
If you screw with it,
it will defect back on the next

00:38:16.076 --> 00:38:20.570
turn.
It is, however, forgiving.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.889
Do you want to get nice with it?
Be nice.

00:38:23.889 --> 00:38:26.397
If you're nice,
it'll be nice back at you later

00:38:26.397 --> 00:38:28.090
on.
It's also transparent,

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:32.030
nothing complicated about it,
and that's actually important.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.440
It's not merely that it's not a
sucker and forgiving.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.704
More to the point,
it is--you could tell it's not

00:38:41.704 --> 00:38:44.195
a sucker.
And you could tell it's

00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:46.296
forgiving.
And this very powerful

00:38:46.296 --> 00:38:50.360
algorithm learned to cooperate
even in the situation--and

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.569
helped--learned to make it out
the best even in a situation

00:38:54.569 --> 00:38:58.269
where there's a risk of cheating
and betrayal.

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:04.117
Some psychologists have argued
that our emotions correspond to

00:39:04.117 --> 00:39:09.389
the different permutations on
The Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:39:09.389 --> 00:39:11.989
We like people who cooperate
with us.

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:15.860
This motivates us to be nice to
them in the future much as the

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.286
Tit-for-Tat algorithm says,
"If you are nice to me now,

00:39:19.286 --> 00:39:23.382
I'll be nice to you back."
We don't like being screwed

00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:25.278
with.
We feel anger and distrust

00:39:25.278 --> 00:39:28.489
towards those who betray us.
That motivates us to betray or

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:31.824
avoid them in the future.
And we feel bad when we betray

00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:35.313
somebody who cooperates with us.
This motivates us to behave

00:39:35.313 --> 00:39:39.114
better in the future.
You can break down the cells of

00:39:39.114 --> 00:39:44.462
The Prisoner's Dilemma in terms
of emotions that they give rise

00:39:44.462 --> 00:39:46.784
to.
I did an experiment last night

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:49.429
with my seven-year-old and my
ten-year-old.

00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:53.039
I explained to them The
Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:56.626
I didn't give the divorce
lawyer example but-- [laughter]

00:39:56.626 --> 00:40:00.469
and we gave them a big thing of
chocolate chips and--the good

00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:03.292
chocolate chips.
We had the good chips and we

00:40:03.292 --> 00:40:05.329
had the matrix and we had them
play.

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:09.350
Now, what they did isn't so
interesting, but what's

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.289
interesting is they were furious
at each other.

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:15.020
One of them,
the younger boy,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.853
was--kept being betrayed by the
older boy including tricks like

00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:21.440
he'd say, "Okay.
Let's both cooperate."

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.840
"Yeah.
Okay."

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.780
Then he'd cooperate-- "defect!"
And [laughter]

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:33.048
the response was anger,
though not actually guilt on

00:40:33.048 --> 00:40:37.349
the part of the other boy
[laughter]

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:42.036
but rage.
And we see these sort of things

00:40:42.036 --> 00:40:45.710
all the time in real life.
You're familiar with The

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.663
Prisoner's Dilemma but there's
another game,

00:40:47.663 --> 00:40:49.480
which you might not be familiar
with.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.723
It's called The Ultimatum Game.
How many of you have

00:40:52.723 --> 00:40:56.110
encountered The Ultimatum Game?
Okay, some of you.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.040
Very simple.
Choose a partner.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.915
It's a very simple game.
When economists study this they

00:41:01.915 --> 00:41:04.050
actually do this with real
money.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.710
I do not have real money to let
you do this too.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.389
One of you is "A," one of you
is "B."

00:41:09.389 --> 00:41:13.240
The one on the right most from
this side is "A."

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.170
The other one is "B."
Here is a very simple rule.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.780
I'd like "A" to turn to "B" and
make an offer.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.996
"A" has ten dollars.
You can give "B" any amount you

00:41:25.996 --> 00:41:31.710
choose from that ten dollars,
from one dollar to ten dollars.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:36.530
"B" can do only one thing.
"B" can accept it;

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.186
if you accept it,
you agree to take home the

00:41:39.186 --> 00:41:42.460
money and "A" keeps what ever's
left--or reject it.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.150
If you reject it,
you get nothing.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.550
Nobody gets anything.
Is everybody clear?

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.608
So "A" is going to say,
"I'll give you so and so

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:51.925
dollars."
"B" would say,

00:41:51.925 --> 00:41:55.388
"Okay," in which case "B" walks
away with so and so dollars

00:41:55.388 --> 00:41:59.090
or--and "A" walks away with
whatever rest or "B" could say,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:04.010
"Reject," in which case nobody
gets anything.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.989
So, this game comes in two
steps.

00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:08.210
The first thing:
I would like "A" to turn to "B"

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.250
and make your offer.

00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:14.370
Don't--"B" doesn't do anything
yet.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.460
Make your offer.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.586
Your offer should be one word.
People are explaining their

00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:27.520
offer.
Make your offer.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.470
Okay.
Stage two.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.953
Do not negotiate.
[laughter]

00:42:34.953 --> 00:42:37.060
You're not--I see people waving
their hands and it's

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.774
complicated.
It should be a number from one

00:42:39.774 --> 00:42:44.308
to ten, a positive integer.
Now, "B" --I would like "B" to

00:42:44.308 --> 00:42:48.950
say one word and you can say it
really loud on three.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.820
Accept or reject.
One, two, three.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.270
[laughter] Wow.
How many people accepted?

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.920
Anybody reject it?
Good.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.837
Okay.
How many people offered ten

00:43:07.837 --> 00:43:10.043
dollars?
[laughter]

00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:12.410
How many people offered more
than five dollars?

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.796
Okay.
How many people offered one

00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:17.119
dollar?
Okay.

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:21.020
When you offered one dollar did
you accept?

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.583
Anybody else offer one dollar?
When you offered one dollar did

00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:27.130
your partner accept?
Okay.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:31.120
How many people offered either
four or five dollars?

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.613
Okay.
This is an interesting game

00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:39.201
because the person who
offered--who accepted one dollar

00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:43.491
was being rational.
One dollar is better than no

00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:46.291
dollars.
So, the psychology of human

00:43:46.291 --> 00:43:50.333
rationality is such that,
from a logical point of view,

00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:54.449
you should reason one dollar is
better than nothing.

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:57.130
A rational person should accept
one dollar.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.534
And because we're smart,
a--you should offer one dollar

00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:03.120
but not many of you offered one
dollar.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.799
Why?
Because you knew people are not

00:44:07.799 --> 00:44:11.331
purely rational.
People, even in a one-shot

00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:14.030
game, won't accept unfair
distributions.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.870
They'll reject them just out of
spite.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:22.775
And so, you need to offer more.
And this has been studied from

00:44:22.775 --> 00:44:26.487
a neuro-economic point of view,
which basically provides

00:44:26.487 --> 00:44:30.537
neuroanatomical evidence that
people--if you offered them one

00:44:30.537 --> 00:44:33.444
dollar they get really pissed.
[laughter]

00:44:33.444 --> 00:44:35.460
Nobody likes to be offered a
dollar.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.115
Now, there's a more general
moral here, which is actually an

00:44:39.115 --> 00:44:42.710
interesting surprise of some
relevance to everyday life.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.780
A rational person is easily
exploited.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.433
A rational person's responses
to provocations,

00:44:51.433 --> 00:44:56.809
to assaults will always be
measured inappropriate.

00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:00.102
If you know I'm rational and
you're in a sharing situation

00:45:00.102 --> 00:45:02.240
with me, you could say to me,
"Hey.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.559
Here's a dollar.
Hey, Mr.

00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:05.280
Rational, a dollar's better
than nothing."

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.150
"Well, okay," because I'm
rational.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:12.617
Similarly, you could mess with
me because you could harass me

00:45:12.617 --> 00:45:15.705
in all sorts of ways,
take things that I own,

00:45:15.705 --> 00:45:19.293
as long as you reason that a
rational person wouldn't start a

00:45:19.293 --> 00:45:23.082
fuss about this.
There is some advantage to

00:45:23.082 --> 00:45:26.960
being irrational,
to having a temper.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.090
Because if you have a temper
and you're known to be

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.847
irrational, people are forced,
by dint of your irrationality,

00:45:33.847 --> 00:45:37.719
to treat you better.
Who am I going to take from?

00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:41.497
The person who's extremely
reasonable or the person who has

00:45:41.497 --> 00:45:45.102
a hair-trigger temper?
Well, I'm going to pick on a

00:45:45.102 --> 00:45:49.261
reasonable person because the
unreasonable person might do

00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:52.440
unreasonable things.
And this is faintly

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.099
paradoxical, but often to be
irrational, or at least to have

00:45:57.099 --> 00:45:59.863
a reputation for mild
irrationality,

00:45:59.863 --> 00:46:03.115
gives you an edge.
Now, this isn't focus of

00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:06.704
provocation but this has also
been presented in the theory of

00:46:06.704 --> 00:46:10.502
why people fall in love.
Suppose you're choosing who to

00:46:10.502 --> 00:46:13.775
devote your life to,
and it's a matter of huge

00:46:13.775 --> 00:46:15.565
trust.
We're going to raise kids

00:46:15.565 --> 00:46:17.634
together.
It's very important for you

00:46:17.634 --> 00:46:20.806
that I don't leave.
And I am very rational so I say

00:46:20.806 --> 00:46:24.823
to you, "We should mate and have
children because I find you the

00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:28.776
most attractive of everybody who
was available that I've met so

00:46:28.776 --> 00:46:31.436
far.
I'm very rational and so long

00:46:31.436 --> 00:46:35.250
as this continues to be the case
we'll be together."

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.358
Well, that's reasonable and
rational but wouldn't you rather

00:46:39.358 --> 00:46:42.769
be with somebody who's head over
heels in love?

00:46:42.769 --> 00:46:46.217
Head over heels in love is
irrational but it's also,

00:46:46.217 --> 00:46:49.556
within certain parameters,
endearing because the

00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:53.551
irrationality of the person
means you could trust them more

00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:56.822
in the long run,
just like the irrationality of

00:46:56.822 --> 00:47:00.616
somebody who has a temper means
you don't mess with them as

00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:03.633
much.
The studies have been done more

00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:06.849
with regard to violence than
with love.

00:47:06.849 --> 00:47:11.282
And in fact,
the irrationality--the benefits

00:47:11.282 --> 00:47:17.878
of irrational violence have been
translated in terms of the study

00:47:17.878 --> 00:47:24.198
of homicide and other crimes.
Daly and Wilson describe the

00:47:24.198 --> 00:47:29.620
cause of murder.
Most murder is not caused by

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:35.170
reasonable provocation.
Most murder is not rational in

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.652
its response.
Most murder is generated by

00:47:38.652 --> 00:47:41.352
insult, curse,
petty infraction,

00:47:41.352 --> 00:47:44.750
but this is not crazy
irrationality.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.965
It's adaptive irrationality.
Daly and Wilson point out,

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:51.221
"in chronically feuding and
warring societies an essential

00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:54.250
manual--manly virtue is the
capacity for violence.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.640
To turn the other cheek is not
saintly, but stupid or

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.932
contemptibly weak."
If I show myself a rational

00:48:00.932 --> 00:48:04.491
person when picked on or
harassed, I'll be known as

00:48:04.491 --> 00:48:07.409
somebody you could pick on and
harass.

00:48:07.409 --> 00:48:10.255
And in fact,
it turns out even in the modern

00:48:10.255 --> 00:48:14.160
world--This is from a New
York Times I just picked up

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.462
a year ago today.
And the point is that the

00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:21.440
violence is due to people
disrespecting each other or

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.785
giving a dirty look.
And you might think "isn't that

00:48:24.785 --> 00:48:26.705
irrational?"
But it's not irrational in

00:48:26.705 --> 00:48:29.747
circumstances where people live
together in an environment where

00:48:29.747 --> 00:48:32.500
they have to deal with each
other over and over again,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.094
and often where there's not
much support by the police as

00:48:36.094 --> 00:48:38.469
indications they talked about
here.

00:48:38.469 --> 00:48:44.370
What's particularly interesting
is this sort of importance of a

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:49.889
reputation for violence differs
from culture to culture.

00:48:49.889 --> 00:48:53.949
And I've been talking so far in
this class--and in fact,

00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:57.050
so far in this course--about
universals,

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.614
about things that are built in,
things that show up across

00:48:59.614 --> 00:49:03.404
humans and other animals.
I want to turn now and end this

00:49:03.404 --> 00:49:08.469
lecture by talking a little bit
about a cultural difference.

00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:11.555
And it's a psychologically
interesting cultural difference

00:49:11.555 --> 00:49:15.119
with regard to the emotions.
And it's built around the

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:19.774
difference turning around what
sociologists call "cultures of

00:49:19.774 --> 00:49:23.142
honor."
A culture of honor has certain

00:49:23.142 --> 00:49:26.280
properties.
You can't rely on the law.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.980
And it has resources that are
easily taken.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.808
And sociologists have argued
that when those conditions are

00:49:34.808 --> 00:49:38.703
met it becomes important to
develop a reputation for violent

00:49:38.703 --> 00:49:42.349
retaliation.
That becomes important.

00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:45.965
Examples of culture of honors
include Scottish highlanders,

00:49:45.965 --> 00:49:48.210
Masai warriors,
Bedouin tradesmen,

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:51.890
and Western cowboys – all
cases where there's resources

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.440
such as cattle that are
vulnerable and easily taken,

00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.192
but you can't count on calling
911 and having people come help

00:50:00.192 --> 00:50:02.237
you.
But the culture of honor that's

00:50:02.237 --> 00:50:05.291
been studied the most by modern
psychologists is the American

00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:07.764
South.
This was settled by herdsmen

00:50:07.764 --> 00:50:11.650
and traditionally has less
centralized legal control.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:14.693
So, the sociologists say the
American South has more of a

00:50:14.693 --> 00:50:17.030
culture of honor than the
American North.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:19.820
But how do you know?
What does that do?

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:24.409
We're interested in this class
in claims about psychology.

00:50:24.409 --> 00:50:29.802
So, it took Richard Nisbett and
Dov Cohen to study cultures of

00:50:29.802 --> 00:50:34.065
honors and look at differences.
And they found some interesting

00:50:34.065 --> 00:50:36.285
differences.
Gun laws tend to be more

00:50:36.285 --> 00:50:40.218
permissive in the southern--in
the American South than the

00:50:40.218 --> 00:50:43.822
American North.
Corporal punishment and capital

00:50:43.822 --> 00:50:46.869
punishment tend to be more
approved of.

00:50:46.869 --> 00:50:49.500
Attitudes towards the military
are more positive.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.256
In questionnaire studies,
people are more forgiving

00:50:52.256 --> 00:50:55.832
towards cultures of honor.
Somebody insults my woman and I

00:50:55.832 --> 00:50:59.395
punch him in the face.
This is considered less bad in

00:50:59.395 --> 00:51:02.409
the American South than the
American North.

00:51:02.409 --> 00:51:05.904
There's a higher rate of
violence but only in certain

00:51:05.904 --> 00:51:08.436
circumstances.
The streets of the American

00:51:08.436 --> 00:51:11.404
South as a rule are not more
dangerous than the American

00:51:11.404 --> 00:51:13.468
North.
The difference is there's a

00:51:13.468 --> 00:51:16.624
higher rate of crimes that are
crimes of honor such as,

00:51:16.624 --> 00:51:18.963
for instance,
if somebody breaks in to my

00:51:18.963 --> 00:51:22.673
house, me shooting him.
Or if somebody insults me,

00:51:22.673 --> 00:51:25.937
me killing him.
Now, this is sort of survey

00:51:25.937 --> 00:51:28.429
studies.
So, Nisbett and Cohen did one

00:51:28.429 --> 00:51:31.647
of the more interesting
psychological studies I have

00:51:31.647 --> 00:51:34.510
ever heard of.
And they did this

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.639
at--This--Sorry.
This is Nisbett and Wilson.

00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:40.400
They did this with University
of Michigan undergraduates.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.242
They did a subject pool thing
like you're doing now,

00:51:44.242 --> 00:51:48.159
and on it your demographic
information was listed.

00:51:48.159 --> 00:51:53.444
And what they did was they took
white males who are not Hispanic

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:56.460
and not Jewish.
That was their sample.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.781
Culture of honor is a phenomena
limited to males and they wanted

00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:03.050
to make it sort of a clean study
so they wanted to focus--get a

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.080
homogenous sample.
So, not Hispanic, not Jewish.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.739
And they provoked them.
And the provocation was genius.

00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:14.141
What they did was they
said--they brought people in to

00:52:14.141 --> 00:52:16.659
the psychology building,
as you'd be brought in to

00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:19.875
Kirtland or SSS or Dunham and
they said--they had somebody go

00:52:19.875 --> 00:52:22.260
in to the desk and they said,
"Yeah.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.360
Go down the hall for the
experiment."

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.460
There was a hallway and then
you walked through the hallway.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.293
And walking in the other
direction at that moment a

00:52:30.293 --> 00:52:33.409
graduate student--a male
graduate student would start to

00:52:33.409 --> 00:52:35.309
walk.
And he's holding some files.

00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:39.905
And what he does is he bumps
the person, looks at him and

00:52:39.905 --> 00:52:43.679
says, "Asshole" [laughter]
and keep walking.

00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:47.672
Now, to be fair,
the graduate student survived

00:52:47.672 --> 00:52:52.230
bumping into hundreds of males,
calling them assholes and then

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.219
walking to--Fights did not break
out, nobody was shot.

00:52:55.219 --> 00:52:59.084
But then they brought the
men--now went in to a room and

00:52:59.084 --> 00:53:03.297
they were tested.
And it turned out that there

00:53:03.297 --> 00:53:07.510
were differences in the stress
response.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.163
On average, males from the
American South showed higher

00:53:11.163 --> 00:53:14.748
hormone response and stress
response than males in the

00:53:14.748 --> 00:53:18.739
American North--increases in
testosterone and cortisol.

00:53:18.739 --> 00:53:22.584
There's always differences in
later behavior,

00:53:22.584 --> 00:53:27.039
the people--suggesting that
they were made angry.

00:53:27.039 --> 00:53:30.361
They gave differences in
fill-in-the-blank questions,

00:53:30.361 --> 00:53:33.622
for instance.
I don't remember the examples

00:53:33.622 --> 00:53:38.228
but it's examples like "John
went to the store and bought a

00:53:38.228 --> 00:53:42.278
'blank'" and then the
northerners would say "and buy

00:53:42.278 --> 00:53:45.398
an apple."
And the southerners would say

00:53:45.398 --> 00:53:48.722
"an AK-47 [laughter]
to kill that freaking graduate

00:53:48.722 --> 00:53:50.145
student."
[laughter]

00:53:50.145 --> 00:53:53.460
Now, again, the American
South--people in the American

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.400
South were not overall more
violent than the American North,

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.929
but they were more sensitive to
provocations of honor.

00:54:00.929 --> 00:54:03.792
Now, when I gave this lecture a
few years ago,

00:54:03.792 --> 00:54:07.545
a southern student contacted me
afterwards and said that she

00:54:07.545 --> 00:54:11.171
felt that picking out the
southern minority at Yale was in

00:54:11.171 --> 00:54:15.052
some regard offensive and that
people say things at Yale about

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:18.105
southerners--American
southerners that they would

00:54:18.105 --> 00:54:21.349
never say about any other
minority group.

00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:23.389
So, there's two points I want
to make regarding this.

00:54:23.389 --> 00:54:26.719
One is, of course,
these are average differences.

00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:29.536
Not every northerner and
southerner would differ along

00:54:29.536 --> 00:54:32.043
these lines.
But another one is I think the

00:54:32.043 --> 00:54:34.512
effect is real,
but it's not entirely clear

00:54:34.512 --> 00:54:38.099
that it reflects poorly on the
cultures of honor as opposed to

00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:40.292
the other cultures.
So, Nisbett,

00:54:40.292 --> 00:54:43.098
for instance,
is himself a southerner and he

00:54:43.098 --> 00:54:47.078
points out that he went to the
North he was most astonished by

00:54:47.078 --> 00:54:49.828
how rude people are.
And this is because the

00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:53.039
North--the American North is not
particularly a culture of honor,

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:57.007
and so there's less proper
behavior towards other people

00:54:57.007 --> 00:55:00.829
because there's no fear of
retaliation or response.

00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:05.373
Moreover, the culture of honor
virtues like honor,

00:55:05.373 --> 00:55:08.525
loyalty, courage and
self-reliance,

00:55:08.525 --> 00:55:13.440
are on the face of it not
necessarily bad things.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.044
In any case,
this is an interesting example

00:55:17.044 --> 00:55:22.280
of how there's an evolutionary
background but culture modifies

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.367
and shifts it in different ways.
More generally,

00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:30.355
I've suggested over the last
couple of lectures that emotions

00:55:30.355 --> 00:55:32.604
like fear,
the love you have towards your

00:55:32.604 --> 00:55:34.680
children, anger,
gratitude are not aberrations

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.330
or noise in the system.
Rather, they're exquisitely

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:40.608
complicated motivational systems
that are crafted to deal with

00:55:40.608 --> 00:55:42.650
the natural and social
environment.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:47.181
And we know this only from an
analysis that starts from an

00:55:47.181 --> 00:55:50.820
evolutionary approach.
So, to bring us back to D'Arcy

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.570
Thompson, "everything is the way
it is because it got that way."

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:59.800
And your reading response for
this week is that.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:04.580
And I'll wish you good luck on
the exam on Wednesday.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.180
And I'll see you there.

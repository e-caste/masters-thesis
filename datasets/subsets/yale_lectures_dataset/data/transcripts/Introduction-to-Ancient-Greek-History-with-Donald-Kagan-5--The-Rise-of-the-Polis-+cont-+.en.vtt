00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.386
Professor Donald Kagan:
Okay, we were discussing

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:11.074
the rise of the polis and
I was into the subject of the

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:15.992
way the Greeks thought about the
significance and the function of

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:20.730
the polis,
which is really critical in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.890
distinguishing between the
polis example of a city

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.510
state and other city states in
history.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.039
It's the notion of what the
function of that state is,

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.759
I think, that is most striking.
I was about to tell you last

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:47.558
time about the poet Hesiod,
who lived in a little town in

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:53.004
Boeotia to the north of Attica.
He describes himself as a

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:57.469
farmer and in the Works and
Days, he talks about the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.318
quarrel that he had with his
brother and how he was

00:01:01.318 --> 00:01:03.842
mistreated,
in his opinion,

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:08.926
when his brother bribed the
barrens, the basileus, in

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:13.000
his area,
and cheated him of his birth

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.110
right.
He quotes a kind of a fable.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.860
He says that he is a fool;
I'm sorry, he tells this fable

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.901
of the hawk and the nightingale,
which illustrates really the

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:33.258
doctrine of might over right.
The hawk says he is a fool who

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:37.440
tries to match his strength with
the stronger.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.025
He will lose the battle and
with the shame will be hurt

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:46.264
also.
So, don't try to fight against

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:51.462
stronger people is what he said.
Hesiod says that this is

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:54.339
the wrong doctrine.
It is better,

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:58.459
he says, to go by the path
leading to justice.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.492
For when justice is outraged,
and by the way justice here is

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:08.610
personified in the form of the
goddess called Dike.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.118
She follows before us weeping
to the polis and the

00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:17.640
gatherings of people.
She puts a dark mist upon her

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.337
and brings a curse upon all
those who drive her out,

00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:26.389
who deal in her and twist her
in dealing.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.956
He speaks about the word
polis more than once in

00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:34.040
the same general context.
He draws a contrast between the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.270
men who give just decisions to
strangers and to natives,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.034
and who do not depart from what
is just, and those who practice

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:47.353
violence and cruel deeds.
In the case of the former,

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:51.840
the polis flourishes and
its people prosper.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.355
Peace reigns over their land
and Zeus keeps them free of

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.241
wars.
They don't suffer famines or

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:02.530
disasters.
Their flocks have thick wool.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.335
Their wives bear them children.
So fruitful is their land that

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:11.398
they are spared the evil
necessity of traveling on ships

00:03:11.398 --> 00:03:14.943
and there you have an
interesting point about the

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:17.574
Greeks.
Hesiod is not alone in saying,

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.946
for God's sake try not to take
a voyage at sea because your

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.330
chances of coming back are
really bad,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.594
which was a reality to a degree.
That's a very strange thing

00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:30.782
because the Greeks turn out to
be an enormously active

00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:33.970
seafaring people with tremendous
fear of the seas.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.819
I think that those things are
connected.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.028
What about those who don't
follow the path of

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:42.970
righteousness,
of justice, of Dike?

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.830
Zeus orders severe punishments
for them.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.377
Often, even a whole
polis,

00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:54.479
is paid punishment for one bad
man.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.257
His people are troubled by
disaster, plagues,

00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:02.120
famines, the men die,
the women are barren.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.033
At another time,
Zeus destroys the wide camped

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:10.382
army of people or wrecks their
city with its walls,

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:13.599
or their ships on the open
water.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.479
Well, one thing that emerges
from these lines of Hesiod is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.990
that the polis is already
there.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.903
There is no way to talk about
what he's talking about in the

00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:29.617
kinds of settlements that
existed before the invention of

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:32.219
the polis,
and that I think is worth

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.551
mentioning.
If our date for him,

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:38.490
which is very problematical,
is right roughly,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.855
then by certainly 700 B.C.
there are people who know what

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:45.290
poleis are,
poleis exist.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.924
But beyond that,
there is the fact that for the

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:55.300
Greeks that early and always--by
the way it remained so,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.731
the notion of justice is
directly connected with a

00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:05.704
polis.
The only place where justice

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:08.709
exists or can exist is in a
polis.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.546
The only way you can lead a
good life is if you live in a

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.150
polis,
and when you do live in a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.052
polis of course,
you will have to behave justly

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:22.129
because--and this is
tremendously important,

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.773
your behavior doesn't affect
just you and your family,

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:29.839
it involves the entire
community.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.759
Remember, even one bad man can
ruin a polis.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.219
That is a very strong statement
about the priority of community

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.237
and it's very different from the
values that we saw in the

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:48.759
Iliad and the
Odyssey.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.097
You cannot imagine,
it seems to me,

00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:54.810
in the world that Hesiod
describes, Achilles or anybody

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.770
else saying,
"Well, you insulted me and so

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.170
I'm not going to fight anymore
for my polis."

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.040
That would have been
inconceivable in this world.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.279
Now, given this
information, we are onto the

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.692
problem that will be a problem
for the Greek polis for

00:06:13.692 --> 00:06:19.194
the rest of its history and it's
really a problem to this very

00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:24.066
day for all people who live in
some sort of a civilized

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:27.818
community.
How do you reconcile the

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:31.630
interests and desires,
and well being of the

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.241
individual and his immediate
family with those of the

00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:39.487
community at large?
They may seem,

00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:43.560
and probably might even be said
to be, different and

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.031
antagonistic at some point,
and when they are what should

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.594
you do?
For the Greeks the answer was

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:57.353
pretty clear hereafter.
One ought to be interested and

00:06:57.353 --> 00:07:02.879
to take action on behalf of the
polis.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.861
We'll be seeing this kind of
argument and people presenting

00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:10.019
positions about it going on into
the future.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.138
But nobody is going to be very
comfortable, if comfortable at

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:15.937
all.
It would be a very oddball

00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:18.500
position to take for the rest of
Greek history.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.001
No, the right thing to do is to
take care of yourself and the

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:23.818
hell with the polis.
That's not what you're going to

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.996
hear.
What you're going to hear is to

00:07:25.996 --> 00:07:28.010
the contrary.
Little bit later,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.004
when we get to talking about
Sparta, you'll see a beautiful

00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:35.860
example of that in the form of
the poems of Tyrtaeus,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.565
who is a poet in Sparta,
and whose poetry became so

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:44.161
central to their way of thinking
and living that they were used

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:48.459
as marching songs for the
Spartan army as they walked,

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:52.149
and they make the same point,
but I'll come back to that.

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:55.468
Now, here's another
document that you want to be

00:07:55.468 --> 00:07:59.241
aware of that gives you some
idea of what the Greeks fairly

00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.689
early thought the polis
was for and about,

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:05.175
and what the relationship
between individual and

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:10.421
polis was.
In this case I'm talking about

00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:19.185
Herodotus, who very early in his
history tells the story really

00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:26.424
of his visit to Lydia,
to the land of the great Tyrant

00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:32.519
Croesus, who is also the richest
man in the world.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:35.552
It's not clear that this event
ever really took place,

00:08:35.552 --> 00:08:37.669
but it's really not very
important,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.202
because what Herodotus is doing
is telling how he,

00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:47.845
I think, and how the Greeks in
general viewed the questions at

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:51.110
issue.
So on goes the visit to Croesus.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.283
Croesus asked Solon to tell him
who is the happiest,

00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:59.865
the most fortunate--both of
those things contained in the

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:03.220
words he uses--that he had ever
seen.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.319
Solon was now a man of full
years, he was a man greatly

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:11.875
respected, and he turns out to
be one of the seven sages that

00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:16.809
the ancient Greeks selected for
the wisest men who ever were.

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:22.419
So, it would be interesting to
know what he thought about that.

00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:25.768
Of course,
Croesus had shown his

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:30.981
great wealth already to Solon.
In my view, he put the question

00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:34.251
this way.
Solon, as he looked around at

00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:37.744
his fabulous wealth and great
good fortune,

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:42.318
who do you think is the
happiest, fortunate man you ever

00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.201
knew?
You know what the answer was

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.701
that he expected.
Solon answered,

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:53.496
Tellus of Athens.
I'll bet you never heard of

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:57.042
Tellus of Athens,
neither had Croesus,

00:09:57.042 --> 00:10:00.750
neither had anybody else
outside of Athens.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.774
Croesus was astonished
and he asked Solon why did he

00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:10.532
select Tellus?
Here's what Herodotus says:

00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:16.901
First, because his city was
flourishing, that is his

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:22.022
polis,
and he himself had sons both

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:26.736
beautiful and good.
The words in Greek are kalos

00:10:26.736 --> 00:10:29.780
kagathos for the singular,
kaloi kagathoi for

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.940
plural and it's a kind of a
formula.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:37.939
It means a gentleman;
it means the best kind of

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:40.280
person.
If a person kalos

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.636
kagathos,
it means he is good to look at

00:10:43.636 --> 00:10:48.163
and his soul is excellent -- all
that you could expect of a

00:10:48.163 --> 00:10:50.872
person.
So, he had sons,

00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:56.077
beautiful and good,
and he lived to see children

00:10:56.077 --> 00:11:01.837
born to each of them,
and these children all grew up,

00:11:01.837 --> 00:11:06.809
and further.
After a life spent in what our

00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:12.164
people look upon as comfort,
his end was surpassingly

00:11:12.164 --> 00:11:14.897
glorious.
In a battle between the

00:11:14.897 --> 00:11:18.004
Athenians and their neighbors
near Eleusis he came to the

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:22.745
assistance of his countrymen,
routed the foe and died upon

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:27.790
the field most gallantly.
The Athenians gave him a public

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.001
funeral on the spot where he
fell and paid him the highest

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:34.431
honors.
So, to summarize,

00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:38.411
the happiest,
the most fortunate man that

00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:44.083
Solon ever knew was a dead
Athenian that nobody ever heard

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:45.980
of.
Why?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.989
What does this say?
Right, we see in this passage

00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:53.756
something that reveals so much
about what the Greek values were

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:57.754
and you'll see how closely they
were tied up with the

00:11:57.754 --> 00:12:03.060
polis and the primacy of
the polis in their lives.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.248
Well, why are things good?
Well, his city,

00:12:05.248 --> 00:12:07.049
his polis was going
well.

00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:09.895
A man who is living in a
polis not doing well,

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.790
how can he be happy?
There's just no way.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.673
Secondly, he had sons.
Now, this has to do with the

00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:21.669
Greek idea about immortality and
mortality.

00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:26.283
Since, the Greeks really didn't
believe in personal immortality,

00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:29.140
how do you find what everybody
wants?

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.980
Immortality.
One way is through your family

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.584
and its sons who carry forward
the family name,

00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:39.348
so to speak.
So if you have sons and they

00:12:39.348 --> 00:12:42.470
are healthy, and they do well,
and they have children,

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.806
that means your name will be
carried into the future,

00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:52.059
your memory will persist and
that is one form of immortality.

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:54.732
Then, of course,
the greatest form of

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:59.007
immorality--and think of it when
you compare it with what was the

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:03.549
form of immortality available to
Achilles and his fellow heroes.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:09.413
You fought for your
polis and when you died

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:14.080
fighting nobly for your
polis,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.362
you will be - and were then -
honored extraordinarily by that

00:13:19.362 --> 00:13:24.820
polis and what everybody
knew was that your memory would

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.750
last thereafter so long as your
polis lasted,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.751
and the proof of it is that
Herodotus knows that story and

00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:36.910
is telling it,
as will other story tellers,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.691
and in fact, it worked.
Here we are talking about

00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:44.700
Tellus all these many years
later thanks to Herodotus.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.794
But the point is that this form
of immortality is available to

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:55.789
Tellus because of his place in
the polis,

00:13:55.789 --> 00:14:00.145
because of the deeds he does
for the polis,

00:14:00.145 --> 00:14:04.856
and that is the greatest
possible payoff.I've been

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:09.212
making the case that a
polis is a different

00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:15.250
thing from any other city state.
I'm not aware that any other

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:21.142
culture that had city states had
ideas of this kind that helped

00:14:21.142 --> 00:14:26.940
explain why one was associated
with it and cared about it.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.421
The final document I want to
use to make the point here comes

00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:35.710
from precisely the poems of
Solon.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.555
As we shall see later,
Solon will be a very important

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:43.742
political figure in Athens,
and at a critical moment in

00:14:43.742 --> 00:14:47.373
Athenian history,
the Athenians will give him the

00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:51.988
honor and the responsibility of
being the sole public official

00:14:51.988 --> 00:14:56.300
and to draw up a new
constitutional laws for Athens,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:02.443
an enormously important job.
And in the course of doing

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:06.512
that, and in the course of
defending himself against the

00:15:06.512 --> 00:15:11.906
attacks after he had done it,
he wrote what really amount to

00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:18.061
political pamphlets to defend
his actions and to set forth the

00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:23.206
ideas that lay under the actual
laws that he had put

00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:28.802
forward.But as you may know,
in writing, the earliest kinds

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:32.404
of writing among the Greeks
anyway, but I think this is not

00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:35.485
atypical,
come not in the form of prose

00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:40.236
but in the form of poetry and
that's because people are used

00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:43.228
to,
before they used writing,

00:15:43.228 --> 00:15:47.768
remember things through verse.
I don't know if that's true of

00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:50.529
you, but it certainly is true of
people of my generation.

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:54.959
The things that they taught us
in school, when they required us

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:57.726
to remember poetry,
no matter how we try,

00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:00.560
we can't forget it,
and the stuff that we had to

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.192
remember that was in prose,
no matter how we try we can't

00:16:04.192 --> 00:16:06.330
remember it.
It's the rhythm.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.300
I'll bet even all of you can
remember songs that you have

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.420
known all your life,
but not other things.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.738
So it's a great mnemonic device.
But in any case,

00:16:16.738 --> 00:16:22.498
that's why Solon's pamphlets
are written in poetry and

00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:26.410
apparently in really good
poetry.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:32.542
So, we have his very words.
Here is a fragment from one

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:37.654
of his poems:
"So the public ruin invades the

00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:42.528
house of each citizen,
and the courtyard doors no

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:47.298
longer have strength to keep it
away, but it overleaps the lofty

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:51.538
wall and though a man runs in
and tries to hide it in his

00:16:51.538 --> 00:16:55.650
chamber or closet,
it ferrets him out.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:01.827
So, my spirit dictates to me.
I must tell the Athenians how

00:17:01.827 --> 00:17:05.960
many evils a city suffers from
bad government."

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.544
The Greek word for that is
dysnomia and how good

00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:17.750
government eunomia
displays all neatness and order,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:23.094
and many times she must be
shackles on the breakers of

00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:27.028
laws.
Now, get this eunomia

00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:31.755
levels rough places,
stops glut and greed,

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:37.592
takes the force from violence,
she dries up the growing

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:42.589
flowers of despair as they grow,
she straightens out crooked

00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:44.992
judgments,
remember those crooked

00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:47.359
judgments that Hesiod complained
about.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:51.934
Well, the polis
straightens out crooked

00:17:51.934 --> 00:17:57.830
judgments, gentles the swollen
ambitions and puts an end to

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:03.222
acts of divisional strife.
She stills the gall of

00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:09.609
wearisome hate and under her
influence all life among mankind

00:18:09.609 --> 00:18:15.018
is harmonious and does well.
Wonderful, where do all these

00:18:15.018 --> 00:18:18.089
good things come from?
From God?

00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:23.383
No, they come from the
polis when its laws are

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:28.880
good and therefore when what the
government provides is

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.359
eunomia rather than the
opposite.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:36.844
He is making a claim here
which is a very strong,

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:39.791
powerful one,
but which was characteristic of

00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:43.410
the Greeks and I want you to
take note of it here.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:48.789
He is giving the law and the
polis that gives law.

00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:53.067
It's not merely a negative
thing the way I think modern

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:55.839
ideas about law,
as for instance,

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:59.670
represented in the American
Constitution are,

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.327
which is to say,
its function is to prevent

00:19:03.327 --> 00:19:08.759
wrong doing,
to punish wrong doing.

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:11.469
It doesn't really--well,
let me just say what the

00:19:11.469 --> 00:19:13.839
polis claims to do here
in Homer.

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:20.369
It claims actually to shape the
character of mankind.

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:23.950
The polis makes,
a good polis,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.029
following good laws,
makes its citizens better.

00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:33.790
It not only defeats wrong,
but it creates right and it

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.920
creates citizens who behave
rightly.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.038
This is tremendously important
because every Greek state that

00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:47.730
we know about made the claim
that that's what it did.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.135
No matter what its constitution
was, no matter how these

00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:53.692
differed from one another,
the idea was that the state has

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:57.380
to make good men and that for a
city to be good,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.049
the men must be good.
This is very different.

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:04.640
If you think about the American
idea as an example of the modern

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.888
way of thinking about these
things, the notion is we can't

00:20:07.888 --> 00:20:10.377
do anything.
The laws can't do anything

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:14.080
about making people better or
worse, it takes them as they are

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.690
and then it deals with them
accordingly.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.600
But for the ancient Greeks that
was not enough.

00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:26.159
If you even think about the
founding fathers Madison,

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:29.637
Federalist ten,
based upon the principle that

00:20:29.637 --> 00:20:33.509
you can expect that men will do
wrong things,

00:20:33.509 --> 00:20:39.203
and that a good constitution
has the role of balancing the

00:20:39.203 --> 00:20:44.653
wrongs off against each other,
so as to produce the closest

00:20:44.653 --> 00:20:47.470
approximation possible to
justice.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.299
You can only do that by
balancing competitive desires

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:55.137
that can be thought of as evil;
faction was what they were

00:20:55.137 --> 00:20:57.897
talking about and everybody
thought faction was bad,

00:20:57.897 --> 00:21:00.937
but it was inevitable.
You couldn't get rid of faction

00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:03.441
by saying to men,
it's not good to be factious,

00:21:03.441 --> 00:21:06.490
you should think of the whole
community at all times.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.339
That's not what the American
constitution is about,

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:12.359
but it was what the Greek
constitutions were about.

00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:14.944
A polis ought to make
men like that,

00:21:14.944 --> 00:21:17.467
and in fact,
there's a great revolution in

00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:21.220
the political theory presented
by the American constitution in

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.990
that it's not the first thing to
do it,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.684
but it was the first one that
was really applied,

00:21:27.684 --> 00:21:31.224
in turning away,
rejecting the possibility that

00:21:31.224 --> 00:21:34.380
a constitution could make men
better.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.828
It accepted the premise that
men were what they were and that

00:21:38.828 --> 00:21:42.609
the state had to control that by
various devices.

00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:46.659
So, it's very important to
see how different from that the

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:50.177
Greek idea was and what an
enormous responsibility the

00:21:50.177 --> 00:21:52.700
polis was supposed to
have,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.638
and of course with that,
there had to be an enormous

00:21:57.638 --> 00:22:02.480
amount of support for the state
by the citizens.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.380
That's another thing I want to
emphasize before I leave this

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.430
subject -- the word,
citizen.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.660
We should not take that for
granted.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.708
By the way, in Greek the word
citizen is politas,

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:18.156
derives from polis.
He's somebody who lives in a

00:22:18.156 --> 00:22:21.000
polis;
he's a citizen.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.233
Well, there never was a citizen
in the world before the

00:22:25.233 --> 00:22:28.590
polis.
There are only subjects,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.680
people who are subject either
to a god, or to the king,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.984
or to a representative of the
god, or to a chieftain or

00:22:37.984 --> 00:22:41.890
whoever, but somebody in a sense
owns them all,

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.107
but nobody owns a citizen.
This is something brand new in

00:22:46.107 --> 00:22:50.402
the world and we shall see how
it crops up in different forms

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:53.910
and how it shapes the course of
Greek history.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.982
Well, this whole business
presents the problem I mentioned

00:22:58.982 --> 00:23:02.167
a moment ago.
All of us have this natural

00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:06.318
selfishness when we are born.
We all seek our own interests

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:10.038
and soon we join up with a
family, we want the family's

00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:13.746
interest up to a point,
but how is this fit together

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:16.619
with the needs of the community
at large?

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:18.855
A problem the Greeks always
wrestled with,

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.309
but when you get down to the
fifth century,

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:24.181
and indeed the latter part of
the fifth century,

00:23:24.181 --> 00:23:27.603
there is a marvelous document
that you will be reading in

00:23:27.603 --> 00:23:31.087
Thucydides,
the famous funeral oration of

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:35.690
Pericles delivered in the winter
of 431 - 430 B.C.,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.983
where one of the,
in my judgment,

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:42.354
great things about Pericles was
that he had given a great deal

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:46.653
of thought to this problem and
presented the best argument he

00:23:46.653 --> 00:23:49.950
could think of for solving that
problem,

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:55.333
which was to claim that the
individual's highest needs and

00:23:55.333 --> 00:24:00.906
greatest personal and family
goals could be met only through

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:05.464
the polis,
that his well being was tied up

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:09.950
inextricably with the well being
of the polis.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.123
Now, you don't have to buy
that and individuals undoubtedly

00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:17.220
found the strain too much from
time to time,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.217
but what's interesting,
is rather the ideal,

00:24:20.217 --> 00:24:24.619
the claim, the theory.
You cannot truly achieve what

00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:29.985
you want and need as a human
being without being an active

00:24:29.985 --> 00:24:35.445
and loyal citizen of this great
community which you need to

00:24:35.445 --> 00:24:40.248
achieve what you want in life.
It is a claim already,

00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:43.677
and as you've seen in
Aristotle, towards the end of

00:24:43.677 --> 00:24:46.420
the history of the free
polis,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.170
it is something necessary for
mankind.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.623
It is the center of his life
and it explains the Greeks

00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:59.128
devotion to the independence,
to the autonomy of the

00:24:59.128 --> 00:25:02.759
polis,
and their desire to beautify

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:07.009
and make it as great as it could
possibly be.

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:10.847
All of that sounds very nice
and it certainly had very nice

00:25:10.847 --> 00:25:13.758
aspects to it,
but there was of course a down

00:25:13.758 --> 00:25:17.213
side to it as well,
which is every polis

00:25:17.213 --> 00:25:20.794
wanted to be great,
and being Greeks they wanted to

00:25:20.794 --> 00:25:24.947
be greater than their neighbors
and sometimes that involved

00:25:24.947 --> 00:25:28.597
conflict,
and it often among the Greeks

00:25:28.597 --> 00:25:32.325
did involve war.
Now, the Greeks were not

00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:35.900
unique in history in constantly
being at war.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.703
That is, if you just examine
the history of the human race,

00:25:39.703 --> 00:25:42.981
so soon as they were
sufficiently organized to wage

00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:45.670
war they began doing it all the
time,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.309
but it is true that the life of
the Greek world was much more

00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:55.104
filled with war throughout the
history of the polis than

00:25:55.104 --> 00:25:59.392
other civilizations,
because other civilizations

00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:03.086
after a time,
had one great power that was

00:26:03.086 --> 00:26:06.509
able to dominate the entire
region.

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:10.681
Egypt being the best example,
so that no longer was war

00:26:10.681 --> 00:26:15.392
possible, but the flip side of
that is, there was also another

00:26:15.392 --> 00:26:19.440
thing that was impossible;
freedom.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.730
In Greece you have a lot of war
and you have a lot of freedom,

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.223
and all of that is tied up,
I think very much,

00:26:27.223 --> 00:26:31.827
with the development of this
very special thing called the

00:26:31.827 --> 00:26:35.027
polis.
Now, let's take a look at

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:37.329
other aspects of the
polis;

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:42.466
not ideas, but rather how it
functioned, how its function

00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:48.152
developed and how that helped to
shape the characteristics that

00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:51.730
it showed in its full blown
period,

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.470
that is to say,
the Classical Period.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:01.645
I want to talk about--there
were really three things that

00:27:01.645 --> 00:27:06.133
come together.
One of them is how the Greeks

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:12.142
in the late Dark Ages and in the
period in which the polis

00:27:12.142 --> 00:27:17.355
emerges, made their living.
The second has to do with how

00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:18.430
they fought.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.814
The third is,
and these are not necessarily

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:33.996
in any particular order,
how they were governed or

00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:37.410
rather how they governed
themselves.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.868
All of these three things,
in my judgment,

00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:45.676
are necessary to understand how
the polis came into

00:27:45.676 --> 00:27:48.924
being,
how it came to be what it was,

00:27:48.924 --> 00:27:53.654
and how it came to fulfill and
believe in these ideas that I

00:27:53.654 --> 00:27:56.539
have just been telling you
about.

00:27:56.539 --> 00:28:00.793
I should say it once,
that this is now a very

00:28:00.793 --> 00:28:03.670
controversial subject.
Let me just back up a second.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.707
Along the way I'm attempting to
also to answer the question that

00:28:09.707 --> 00:28:12.677
people always ask me when they
understand I'm a historian about

00:28:12.677 --> 00:28:15.359
Greece and if they have any
interest in the subject.

00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:17.748
They say, "yeah,
yeah the Greeks were terrific,

00:28:17.748 --> 00:28:20.396
they achieved wonderful things,
they were a miracle,

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:22.110
the golden age,
and all that.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:25.540
But tell me how did that happen?
Why did they do that?

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.018
Why them and not somebody else?"
Until I came upon a brilliant

00:28:31.018 --> 00:28:35.476
solution that another scholar
presents to us,

00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:40.122
all I could do was tell jokes.
I remember,

00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:45.331
way before you guys were born,
there was a TV show run by Sid

00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.923
Caesar,
and one of the characters that

00:28:48.923 --> 00:28:53.917
repeatedly showed up on this
thing was a kind of a comic

00:28:53.917 --> 00:28:58.730
German/Austrian professor of
seemingly everything,

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:03.896
and then Carl Reiner would
interview him on the topic that

00:29:03.896 --> 00:29:07.250
was allegedly the topic of the
day,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.946
and the one I remember best was
he was a great aeronautical

00:29:10.946 --> 00:29:13.559
expert and here he was landing
briefly.

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:17.157
He was being interviewed by
Carl Reiner, and he would ask

00:29:17.157 --> 00:29:19.984
him questions,
and in his comic German accent

00:29:19.984 --> 00:29:22.618
he would give silly answers.
But finally,

00:29:22.618 --> 00:29:24.548
Reiner says,
well, thank you for visiting

00:29:24.548 --> 00:29:27.394
us, it's all very wonderful,
but you know our audience would

00:29:27.394 --> 00:29:29.596
really like to know;
it seems like a simple question

00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:31.460
but it's awfully hard to
understand, but how can a great,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.804
big, enormous,
heavy thing like this airplane

00:29:34.804 --> 00:29:38.005
get off the ground?
He says, oh it's a very simple

00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:39.809
question;
it's not difficult to answer.

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:42.654
I mean, you know the wings go,
and the air runs,

00:29:42.654 --> 00:29:46.104
and then the motor on the
engine and it's a miracle how it

00:29:46.104 --> 00:29:49.373
gets up there and that is the
way I used to explain the

00:29:49.373 --> 00:29:53.740
Greeks,
because I had no better idea.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.039
I could bumble around about
geography and this and that,

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:00.944
but nothing.
Then there came a great

00:30:00.944 --> 00:30:05.483
voice from the west,
Victor Davis Hanson,

00:30:05.483 --> 00:30:09.910
who was a professor at Fresno
State,

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:15.087
California and he thought about
this and he brought to it,

00:30:15.087 --> 00:30:20.538
in addition to extraordinary
intelligence and remarkably good

00:30:20.538 --> 00:30:23.990
knowledge of Greek and the
Greeks,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:30.128
a magical additional element,
and that was the fact that he

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:34.291
was a farmer and he was,
I think, in the fifth

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:37.988
generation that had farmed the
same piece of farmland in

00:30:37.988 --> 00:30:40.565
California,
in the Central Valley of

00:30:40.565 --> 00:30:43.700
California ever since the
nineteenth century.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:49.392
And that climate by the way and
that whole scene is very similar

00:30:49.392 --> 00:30:54.632
to the Mediterranean kind of
climate that the Greek farmers

00:30:54.632 --> 00:30:58.809
were engaged in,
and so it had potentially,

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:02.453
Hanson thought,
and I think he was right,

00:31:02.453 --> 00:31:07.829
proper analogous possibilities
and he came to the conclusion

00:31:07.829 --> 00:31:12.750
that much could be learned about
the development of the

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:18.308
polis if one looked at
the business of how one farms in

00:31:18.308 --> 00:31:23.373
these kinds of environments.
And I think that turns out to

00:31:23.373 --> 00:31:26.176
be a great key to understanding
what's happening,

00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:29.739
and everything you hear from me
on this subject I learned from

00:31:29.739 --> 00:31:31.968
Hanson.
It is, needless to say,

00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:34.347
being a bright,
brilliant idea that one guy

00:31:34.347 --> 00:31:37.521
thought of,
it has been assaulted on all

00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:41.859
sides and there is plenty of
controversy about it.

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:46.429
You start with the Dark Ages
and there is general agreement,

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:51.154
I think, that the population of
Greece had become much smaller

00:31:51.154 --> 00:31:54.640
than it had been in the
Mycenaean Period,

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.531
and that from the standpoint of
the population it could sustain,

00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:05.509
it was under populated.
If you start with a look at

00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:11.474
what was the way in which the
land was worked for the purposes

00:32:11.474 --> 00:32:17.036
of feeding the population,
it would be okay to take a look

00:32:17.036 --> 00:32:22.490
at the Homeric poems as some
kind of evidence to help us out,

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:27.294
and Hanson focused on this,
what was really obviously the

00:32:27.294 --> 00:32:31.069
units that mattered in the world
of Homer,

00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:36.588
call it the family--the Greek
word is oikos,

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:42.220
and it really means household.
But it comes to mean the land

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.117
that the family works,
the family itself,

00:32:45.117 --> 00:32:48.505
and what does it look like?
Well, in the

00:32:48.505 --> 00:32:51.999
Odyssey,
there is a very fine example of

00:32:51.999 --> 00:32:56.859
such a place in the form of the
oikos of King Laertes,

00:32:56.859 --> 00:32:59.891
the father of Odysseus,
who somehow is still alive when

00:32:59.891 --> 00:33:02.361
Odysseus is king,
but he is in retirement and

00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:06.173
there he is.
We see him, a nobleman that he

00:33:06.173 --> 00:33:11.417
is, former king that he is,
working the soil and how he

00:33:11.417 --> 00:33:16.369
does this is very illuminating,
because he is clearly,

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:19.966
according to Hanson,
involved in the period after

00:33:19.966 --> 00:33:23.339
the transition away from an
earlier style.

00:33:23.339 --> 00:33:29.492
The earlier style pictures
rather large estates by Greek

00:33:29.492 --> 00:33:36.315
standards, with raiding warrior
groups going out to steal what

00:33:36.315 --> 00:33:40.259
they can.
They are engaged in raising

00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:45.423
livestock, which in Greece is
more likely to be sheep and

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:49.352
goats than cattle,
but also breeding horses,

00:33:49.352 --> 00:33:53.975
which is very important for the
aristocracy for carrying on

00:33:53.975 --> 00:33:58.598
warfare.Let's flip back a
step beyond that to Mycenaean

00:33:58.598 --> 00:34:03.620
civilization for the purpose of
noting the great contrast,

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.209
the great change.
Remember the ancient near

00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:12.369
eastern kingdoms and their
collectivized agriculture,

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:16.803
control from the center,
the individuals who carry out

00:34:16.803 --> 00:34:20.985
the farming or the grazing.
They are not permitted

00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:24.539
individual initiative;
they are controlled.

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:27.460
This civilization,
like these other ancient

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:30.659
Mediterranean kingdoms,
was rather advanced.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:35.719
They knew how to cultivate the
grape to make excellent wine;

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.664
they knew how to cultivate
olives to be able to make superb

00:34:40.664 --> 00:34:45.610
olive oil and how to process
them to produce the result.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.829
They were engaged in arbor
culture;

00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:52.320
they had fruit trees that
produced very well.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.939
It was a civilization that was
rather advanced in terms of its

00:34:56.939 --> 00:35:00.730
agricultural skill.
They knew the techniques for

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.738
grafting and improving,
and domesticating species of

00:35:04.738 --> 00:35:09.093
grapes and olives particularly.
You can't go out there and just

00:35:09.093 --> 00:35:12.699
plant these things.
What comes out is inedible,

00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:17.273
unusable until you
finally--what's the word that I

00:35:17.273 --> 00:35:18.020
want?

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:27.110
What do you get when you mix
two agricultural things?

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.830
You have to--what do you get?

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.960
You need hybrids,
in order to improve the

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.057
category of what you're doing.
Well, they could do all that

00:35:36.057 --> 00:35:40.560
and that's the knowledge that
was in the palace that allowed

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.300
the kings and his people to send
out messages,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.719
orders to everybody to do what
they did.

00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:50.398
Now, when the palace
civilization collapses,

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:53.896
the whole system collapses.
That explains,

00:35:53.896 --> 00:35:57.161
in large part,
why there was such a decline in

00:35:57.161 --> 00:36:00.500
population, why the Dark Ages
were so dark,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.634
lots of poverty,
lots of starvation,

00:36:02.634 --> 00:36:06.050
but also, as I suggested when I
spoke of this earlier,

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:11.465
also the freedom if you could
make it, to learn and also to

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:15.255
grow stronger.
Now, in some time in that

00:36:15.255 --> 00:36:19.133
period of the Dark Ages,
and Hanson would suggest,

00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:23.723
I think, probably around the
eighth century is the greatest

00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:27.964
transition.
Somehow the oikos

00:36:27.964 --> 00:36:35.400
obtains a chunk of land that is
understood to belong to it.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.133
The Greek word for that is a
kleros,

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:46.445
and what happens is now the
family knows that it has this

00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:48.454
land,
it has it now,

00:36:48.454 --> 00:36:52.501
it will have it next year,
the family will be able to pass

00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:57.099
it on from father to son,
so that he can inherit it,

00:36:57.099 --> 00:37:02.468
and that changes everything.
That kind of stability gives

00:37:02.468 --> 00:37:07.384
promise and is a basis for
making every kind of necessary

00:37:07.384 --> 00:37:12.828
investment in the soil that you
are working in order to make it

00:37:12.828 --> 00:37:16.340
better and more profitable for
you,

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.088
and it's worth it because
you'll be, you and your

00:37:19.088 --> 00:37:22.251
children, there to collect it.
As Hanson says,

00:37:22.251 --> 00:37:27.577
thus arose the kleros,
or the idea of a privately held

00:37:27.577 --> 00:37:31.039
plot attached not to any one
person,

00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:36.078
but rather in perpetuity to a
single farm family or

00:37:36.078 --> 00:37:39.132
oikos.
As Hanson points out,

00:37:39.132 --> 00:37:42.525
look at the difference between
this and previous ways of

00:37:42.525 --> 00:37:46.507
working the soil.
People either rented the land

00:37:46.507 --> 00:37:52.287
from a large landowner or they
were hired help who got nothing

00:37:52.287 --> 00:37:56.739
except a salary or a piece of
what they did.

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:01.303
Serfs who are compelled to work
the land, or in some places even

00:38:01.303 --> 00:38:04.192
slaves, well,
they have no incentive,

00:38:04.192 --> 00:38:08.971
put aside the question even of
capacity, to invest capital for

00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:13.438
the purpose of improving the
size and quality of the their

00:38:13.438 --> 00:38:16.510
crops,
their trees, their vines.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:21.247
They would not be willing to
take the risk without clear

00:38:21.247 --> 00:38:25.239
title to the land.
That is the critical thing.

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:29.184
Once they have it,
and they plant permanent crops,

00:38:29.184 --> 00:38:33.531
that changes the whole basis of
society and the values,

00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:36.590
and the attitudes that go with
it.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:42.174
In short, according to Hanson,
it is the invention of the

00:38:42.174 --> 00:38:47.659
family farm that is the critical
moment in this very,

00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:52.038
very important moment in the
history of the human race and

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:56.110
there certainly is no example of
it that I know of,

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.366
apart from Greece,
when it happens right about

00:38:59.366 --> 00:39:01.824
this period.
You can imagine that this can

00:39:01.824 --> 00:39:05.699
only happen gradually;
none of this happens overnight.

00:39:05.699 --> 00:39:09.373
But if you think of the
time span about 900 to 700 B.C.,

00:39:09.373 --> 00:39:12.300
that is, when these changes are
taking place.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.978
I would have guessed at an
increasing pace as you go

00:39:16.978 --> 00:39:21.230
further down the road.
Then what happens is the

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:25.332
population grows,
and for this the archaeological

00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:29.581
evidence is very strong.
There are getting to be more

00:39:29.581 --> 00:39:32.770
and more people living on the
land of Greece.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.225
What do they do?
One of the problems that it

00:39:36.225 --> 00:39:40.500
produces is the more people you
have, up to a point that's good.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.898
There are more people who can
work to increase the production,

00:39:44.898 --> 00:39:49.153
but beyond that point there are
more people to feed than the

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:53.703
production can produce,
and that leads to a desire for

00:39:53.703 --> 00:39:58.650
expansion of the land available
for cultivation.Now,

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.820
there are a couple of ways that
can go;

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.927
one that was certainly
important and again it's for

00:40:03.927 --> 00:40:06.973
something that Hanson
emphasizes, is what he calls

00:40:06.973 --> 00:40:10.251
internal colonization.
The way these things work,

00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:13.703
when you are engaged in
agriculture, it's natural to go

00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:17.297
first to that soil,
to that patch of land which is

00:40:17.297 --> 00:40:20.579
known to be likely to produce
the best land,

00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:22.696
the most fertile,
the best product,

00:40:22.696 --> 00:40:28.309
the most fertile land there is.
So, that is where they start.

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:31.229
But now, when you need more,
you can't just say I only want

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:34.417
the best bottom land there is.
You move out to someplace that

00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:37.521
nobody bothered to farm before,
because it wasn't profitable

00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:39.519
enough, because you need more
land.

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:43.714
So, marginal land is brought
into play with hard work and

00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:47.533
ingenuity, and this is one of
the things that Hanson

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:51.835
emphasizes that is so helpful.
You got to be a farmer to

00:40:51.835 --> 00:40:56.050
understand these things--not
everything that you try works.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.914
I think the picture he paints
of farming reminds us of the

00:41:00.914 --> 00:41:06.119
picture that Homer pays of human
condition as explained in the

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:10.579
pot--the two jars of Zeus.
Most of the luck is bad;

00:41:10.579 --> 00:41:14.073
it's hard to succeed,
and with some combination of

00:41:14.073 --> 00:41:18.066
luck, skill, determination and
hard work all of that will

00:41:18.066 --> 00:41:22.130
decide which of these farmers
will be successful and which

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.491
will not.
And that's an important thing

00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:26.743
to remember.
There will be success and

00:41:26.743 --> 00:41:29.944
there will be failure.
Hanson says and I'm quoting

00:41:29.944 --> 00:41:33.971
him, "the real beginning in the
West of individual property

00:41:33.971 --> 00:41:37.720
holding on a large scale is what
he is describing."

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:46.815
Hanson himself has a farm that
specializes in grapes for the

00:41:46.815 --> 00:41:50.463
purpose of producing raisins.
I guess all the raisins in the

00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:52.390
world are produced near Fresno,
isn't that right Curtis?

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.615
He points out that the
knowledge of how to do this,

00:42:01.615 --> 00:42:05.320
of how to grow the kind of
grapes you want,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.493
viticulture,
and also arboriculture,

00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:12.030
both of these,
are learned from Asia.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.967
The Asians were ahead and the
end of the isolation of Greece

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:19.862
made possible communication,
and it allowed this kind of

00:42:19.862 --> 00:42:23.997
learning and so you got this
picture of some people learning

00:42:23.997 --> 00:42:27.400
how to do these things very,
very well.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.504
Everything is farmed in a
new way and let me just give you

00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:37.860
a picture of what this new farm
that Hanson describes is like.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.887
There is intensive farming.
It's not extensive in the sense

00:42:42.887 --> 00:42:47.260
that you just have to scatter
your stuff over wide fields;

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.633
that's not what it is.
Every piece of that soil is

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:53.523
necessary.
A lot of it can't produce the

00:42:53.523 --> 00:42:55.849
crop you would most like to
grow.

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:59.434
So, you find another crop that
will grow there that can be

00:42:59.434 --> 00:43:01.579
useful;
that's the picture.

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:05.239
So, you have varied crops,
among them.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:09.261
These are the ones that are
typical of a Mediterranean

00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:11.440
climate.
Everybody needs grain;

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.019
bread is the stuff of life as
you have been rightly told.

00:43:15.019 --> 00:43:18.619
So you try, if you can grow
grain on your land or you grow

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:21.335
it where you can,
if not, you have to get it

00:43:21.335 --> 00:43:25.026
elsewhere.
Olives, for the purposes that I

00:43:25.026 --> 00:43:30.550
mentioned to you the other day
that is a very important one.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:36.829
Vegetables can be grown many
times in places where you could

00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:41.974
never grow wheat or grain.
Fruits from the trees--what

00:43:41.974 --> 00:43:44.699
have I left out Curtis,
anything?

00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:47.470
Have we left out any other
crops?

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.041
That's about it.
Those are the things that you

00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:52.845
do.
Now, observe several things

00:43:52.845 --> 00:43:56.257
about them.
They together will make up

00:43:56.257 --> 00:44:00.847
everything you need to live.
All the food groups are

00:44:00.847 --> 00:44:05.199
represented there.
I have left out meat and fish,

00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:10.442
of course, neither of them very
common in this part of the

00:44:10.442 --> 00:44:12.977
world,
but meat was common enough,

00:44:12.977 --> 00:44:15.824
because there were sheep and
there were goats,

00:44:15.824 --> 00:44:19.050
even when beef would have been
very hard to get.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.652
But what you need to understand
about the Greeks is that they

00:44:21.652 --> 00:44:23.997
don't eat a lot of meat.
Now, you might say,

00:44:23.997 --> 00:44:26.216
how come no fish?
I mean, they're surrounded by

00:44:26.216 --> 00:44:28.172
water everywhere you look.
Well, guess what,

00:44:28.172 --> 00:44:31.571
it turns out fish don't live
everywhere in the water and they

00:44:31.571 --> 00:44:34.630
don't live very much around
Greece as it turns out.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.411
I don't mean no fish,
but no sort of major schools of

00:44:38.411 --> 00:44:40.489
fish.
This is not the banks of

00:44:40.489 --> 00:44:44.150
Newfoundland and the Greeks do
eat fish, but not a lot.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:48.492
So, their diet is a little bit
of that--some of their protein

00:44:48.492 --> 00:44:51.959
from that, then bread,
olive oil, fruit,

00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:56.638
vegetables, cheese,
milk, those kinds of things

00:44:56.638 --> 00:45:01.281
they can do.Well,
now one of the things farmers

00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:05.761
in history discovered is that
it's very hard to do well as a

00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:08.949
farmer if all you do is grow the
crops,

00:45:08.949 --> 00:45:12.730
because people normally don't
use what you grow in the form in

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.440
which you grow it.
I'm thinking again of grapes

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.128
and olives;
they made mostly olive oil and

00:45:19.128 --> 00:45:20.780
wine.
So, what do you do?

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.019
Well, if you're a poor farmer,
you don't know what else to do.

00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:26.331
So, you send it off to a
middleman who does the turning

00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:29.581
of the grapes and the olives
into the liquids that are

00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:32.026
necessary,
and he takes a good bit of the

00:45:32.026 --> 00:45:35.485
profit.
But these farmers didn't do

00:45:35.485 --> 00:45:38.526
that.
They acquired the equipment

00:45:38.526 --> 00:45:42.534
necessary;
grape and olive presses which

00:45:42.534 --> 00:45:48.519
allowed them to purify and to
produce the final product,

00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:51.744
and that made them more
successful than they otherwise

00:45:51.744 --> 00:45:54.420
would have been,
and also another great thing

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.940
that you have to be able to do,
if you're going to succeed as a

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.226
farmer, if you have to have
places to store what you

00:46:00.226 --> 00:46:02.275
produce,
so that you will have it for

00:46:02.275 --> 00:46:06.933
next year when you need it.
And also if you have a surplus,

00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:12.239
and that's a desirable thing to
do, you can sell it.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:15.962
Probably in the early days,
this was largely a question of

00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:18.437
barter.
You could trade it in for those

00:46:18.437 --> 00:46:21.420
things that you didn't make
yourself and needed.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.178
But in any case,
it is a profit,

00:46:23.178 --> 00:46:25.559
but it's no good if it's going
to spoil.

00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:31.300
So it's important to realize
the role of ceramics;

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.671
they need to make storage jars
that could be sealed very well

00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:38.804
and preserve the stuff for a
very long time,

00:46:38.804 --> 00:46:42.621
and indeed, they did that.
Another thing that you need

00:46:42.621 --> 00:46:45.885
to understand about these farms,
if you're going to grasp their

00:46:45.885 --> 00:46:48.360
significance for the society
that will come,

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.070
is that they are small,
really small.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.028
Maybe a typical farm,
you might imagine,

00:46:57.028 --> 00:47:01.329
is maybe ten acres;
that is a very small farm.

00:47:01.329 --> 00:47:02.739
Some of them,
of course, were bigger.

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:07.591
There was no regulation about
it, but we are talking not about

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:11.329
the emergence of an agricultural
aristocracy,

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:15.623
but we are talking about the
emergence of an agricultural

00:47:15.623 --> 00:47:18.230
community of small family farms.

00:47:22.019 --> 00:47:26.454
One of the things that come
with the development of this

00:47:26.454 --> 00:47:30.726
kind of agriculture as the
polis is coming into

00:47:30.726 --> 00:47:33.686
being is slavery.
Now, of course,

00:47:33.686 --> 00:47:39.007
slavery is as old almost as the
human race, and it certainly was

00:47:39.007 --> 00:47:42.469
already present in the world of
Homer,

00:47:42.469 --> 00:47:48.357
but it looks like in the Dark
Ages there were very few slaves

00:47:48.357 --> 00:47:53.460
around just because owning
slaves requires wealth.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.975
You can't have slaves without
wealth, because you got to feed

00:47:56.975 --> 00:48:00.161
them at the very least,
and no matter how wicked a

00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:03.340
master you are,
dead slaves are no good to you.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.350
Chances are you had to pay
something for them;

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:09.743
they are like a machine.
If a slave dies you got to buy

00:48:09.743 --> 00:48:12.282
a new machine,
and while he's alive you got to

00:48:12.282 --> 00:48:14.453
feed him.
So, when you're talking about a

00:48:14.453 --> 00:48:16.670
very poor society,
you're not going to see much

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.609
slavery,
but it is true,

00:48:18.609 --> 00:48:23.684
that as the family farm I've
been describing comes into

00:48:23.684 --> 00:48:26.920
being,
a way is found to use slaves in

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.924
a productive,
positive way,

00:48:28.924 --> 00:48:32.240
positive from the standpoint of
profits.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.262
The reason for that is,
if you are just engaged in a

00:48:40.262 --> 00:48:43.530
single crop farming,
well you plant it,

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:46.781
you take care of it,
and then when the times comes

00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:49.490
you reap it.
What do you do in between?

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:53.035
Well, there's not much to do.
So, you have to feed the slave

00:48:53.035 --> 00:48:56.114
all year round to work only a
small part of the time,

00:48:56.114 --> 00:48:59.553
that's not very profitable.
But Hanson's farm,

00:48:59.553 --> 00:49:04.358
as I like to think of it,
there's work to do all year

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.793
round,
because these different crops

00:49:06.793 --> 00:49:09.943
need attention at different
times, and they need different

00:49:09.943 --> 00:49:13.054
kinds of attention,
and some of them need all kinds

00:49:13.054 --> 00:49:16.844
of very hard work to keep them
going, so that there's plenty of

00:49:16.844 --> 00:49:19.840
work to be done that is useful
and profitable.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.696
Therefore, you will produce
enough profit to make it

00:49:23.696 --> 00:49:26.570
possible, so that these small
farms,

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:32.490
you should imagine had one or
two slaves playing a part in

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.360
this experience.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.675
I mean, you should not
imagine when I say slaves--just

00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:47.889
take out of your mind the
plantations of the old South,

00:49:47.889 --> 00:49:50.821
because when you only have one
or two slaves,

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.820
the master is working right
alongside them,

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.495
doing exactly the same work
that they are doing,

00:49:56.495 --> 00:49:59.739
and also instructing them and
telling them what's what.

00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:03.581
If you want to really
understand this in a practical

00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:07.800
sense, it's more as though these
guys are hired hands.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.375
I mean, they live in the house,
they get fed,

00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:13.769
probably with everybody else,
they work with the master;

00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:17.490
the difference being that they
are slaves rather than free men.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:26.208
One of the funny things is that
the emergence of this family

00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:30.529
farm gives rise to the
polis' character as a

00:50:30.529 --> 00:50:33.900
land in which there is a
citizenry,

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.000
which is to say free men who
rule themselves.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.286
So, the polis will see
the invention of freedom in this

00:50:41.286 --> 00:50:45.011
way, and oddly enough,
it is accompanied by the growth

00:50:45.011 --> 00:50:50.325
of slavery at the same time.
Both slavery and freedom come

00:50:50.325 --> 00:50:54.869
along at the same time in the
Greek world.

00:50:54.869 --> 00:50:59.510
One of the interesting
documents we have is a

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.440
fragmentary inscription from the
Island of Chios.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.524
I think it's in the eighth
century that Hanson points out

00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:13.479
is relevant here.
On it there is little language

00:51:13.479 --> 00:51:17.492
and it's obvious it's talking
about some kind of a town

00:51:17.492 --> 00:51:19.747
council.
This is the first time we have

00:51:19.747 --> 00:51:22.441
such a reference.
The Greek words are,

00:51:22.441 --> 00:51:27.201
boule he demosia;
the best translation I can come

00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:30.309
up with is the council for the
people.

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:33.607
It doesn't mean the council of
the people necessarily,

00:51:33.607 --> 00:51:36.219
that would suggest something
democratic.

00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:39.717
It's probably more oligarchic
or aristocratic,

00:51:39.717 --> 00:51:43.836
but the point is this is
something we haven't heard of

00:51:43.836 --> 00:51:47.320
ever before.
There is clearly some kind of

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:52.111
an official group that has some
sort of political role to play,

00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:54.969
which is popular in its
character.

00:51:54.969 --> 00:51:58.684
It's the word demos
that's at the root of

00:51:58.684 --> 00:52:02.478
demosia and demos
means the people,

00:52:02.478 --> 00:52:05.780
all the people.
That's one of its meanings and

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.599
I think it's the meaning that's
relevant here.

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:12.922
As Hanson points out,
only in early Greece did

00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:18.110
independent agrarians have free
title to their land,

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:24.210
own slaves, and ultimately out
of this council that I told you

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:29.500
about, ultimately,
came to have control of their

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.147
own communities.
Although the political

00:52:33.147 --> 00:52:37.130
development came late in the
process, it did come.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:41.023
As Hanson says,
the new farmer is not just a

00:52:41.023 --> 00:52:45.909
different kind of farmer,
but a different kind of person.

00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:49.924
He is a citizen in his
political role,

00:52:49.924 --> 00:52:56.001
he is a soldier but he is a
soldier not in the pay or the

00:52:56.001 --> 00:53:00.449
hire of a king,
or of an aristocracy;

00:53:00.449 --> 00:53:06.067
he is a citizen soldier who has
participated in the decision

00:53:06.067 --> 00:53:11.780
that says it is time to go to
war and who will play an active

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:18.159
role in making decisions about
his state's policy and behavior.

00:53:18.159 --> 00:53:23.455
He is independent in a way that
nobody who was not a king or an

00:53:23.455 --> 00:53:28.409
aristocrat in the past has ever
been--a new kind of man,

00:53:28.409 --> 00:53:32.910
the backbone of the
polis as it emerges.

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:37.088
I don't want to overstate this.
There is still an aristocracy

00:53:37.088 --> 00:53:42.087
made up of the old guys and they
don't just disappear and there

00:53:42.087 --> 00:53:46.844
will be a long stretch in which
there will be some degree of

00:53:46.844 --> 00:53:51.440
conflict between these new
independent farmers and the old

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.431
established aristocracy,
and never does that aristocracy

00:53:56.431 --> 00:54:00.539
go away, that's old.
I'm simply emphasizing what's

00:54:00.539 --> 00:54:04.460
new in the situation and it's
very new indeed.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:09.400
I might just say a little
bit more.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.676
Hanson has a marvelous
situation in which he's the

00:54:13.676 --> 00:54:18.738
scholar telling us about these
developments in the world of

00:54:18.738 --> 00:54:23.921
ancient agriculture and farming,
but he's also an active farmer

00:54:23.921 --> 00:54:27.119
and reacting to what happens to
farmers today,

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:30.838
and he's written a book,
a wonderful book called,

00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:35.170
Fields Without Dreams,
which is the story of modern

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.463
farming in America.
But this is also true of all of

00:54:38.463 --> 00:54:41.056
Western Europe,
which has to do pretty much

00:54:41.056 --> 00:54:44.512
with the abolition of farmers
and I just don't think it's

00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:48.340
right for me to pass without
mentioning the significance.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:53.813
Nobody knows anything about it.
What percentage of Americans do

00:54:53.813 --> 00:54:57.600
you think worked on farms at the
end of the nineteenth century?

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:05.262
Twenty, thirty percent?
You better believe it's sixty

00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:07.817
to seventy percent,
and the further back you go in

00:55:07.817 --> 00:55:10.842
American history the closer it
is to ninety and ninety-five

00:55:10.842 --> 00:55:13.559
percent.
That's the history of the world;

00:55:13.559 --> 00:55:20.960
the whole human race has spent
the bulk of its time farming.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.202
What percentages of
Americans are engaged in farming

00:55:25.202 --> 00:55:28.452
today?
Well, the figure I saw last was

00:55:28.452 --> 00:55:31.510
a number too small to be
mentioned;

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.757
I mean, to say you just can't
really say how much it is,

00:55:34.757 --> 00:55:36.470
but all right,
two percent.

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:42.050
Does anybody know a farmer?
How, how come?

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.870
Just by accident;
still farming?

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:50.340
God bless him.
Is his son farming?

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:56.036
No kidding, where is this?
Fantastic, that's a marvelous

00:55:56.036 --> 00:55:59.950
thing;
please give him my greetings.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:04.050
But it's kind of a miracle;
I don't know any farmers.

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.320
Oh yeah, I know Hanson,
but if I didn't know him,

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.354
I wouldn't know any farmers.
So, now I don't want to go too

00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:11.721
deeply into this,
but if you're interested in

00:56:11.721 --> 00:56:13.820
this subject get a hold of his
book.

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:22.836
What is inescapable is farmers
are a sociological category of

00:56:22.836 --> 00:56:27.088
people, different from
non-farmers in all kinds of

00:56:27.088 --> 00:56:31.206
critical ways,
and it is just an example of

00:56:31.206 --> 00:56:34.949
how this whole business has
disappeared.

00:56:34.949 --> 00:56:36.820
Nobody even thinks about it
anymore.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.842
If you were to say to me,
what do you think is the most

00:56:40.842 --> 00:56:44.119
important thing,
however you define thing,

00:56:44.119 --> 00:56:48.813
that has changed the character
of life in the United States in

00:56:48.813 --> 00:56:53.821
the twentieth century,
I would say the disappearance

00:56:53.821 --> 00:56:57.654
of farmers.
There are so many ways in which

00:56:57.654 --> 00:57:02.132
that has changed the world,
but I can't do justice to it

00:57:02.132 --> 00:57:05.141
but Hanson does,
so if you want to read,

00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:08.954
Fields Without Dreams,
you can ponder the significance

00:57:08.954 --> 00:57:12.617
of this great change.
Now, I've talked to you

00:57:12.617 --> 00:57:17.287
essentially about the economic
aspect of this phenomenon and

00:57:17.287 --> 00:57:22.273
I'd like to turn next--give me a
second here I just want to find

00:57:22.273 --> 00:57:24.490
out where I am in this.

00:57:34.809 --> 00:57:37.529
These are all my proofs to
support all the things that I've

00:57:37.529 --> 00:57:39.591
already told you,
but I'm not going to bother

00:57:39.591 --> 00:57:41.420
proving it, it would take too
long.

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:54.588
Well, I guess the next thing I
might mention is in the area of

00:57:54.588 --> 00:57:58.117
politics.
If you look at the world of

00:57:58.117 --> 00:58:01.188
Mycenae once again,
we've already seen this,

00:58:01.188 --> 00:58:03.829
you have a despotism of some
kind.

00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:06.905
You have some kind of a lord,
I mean a king,

00:58:06.905 --> 00:58:10.696
for lack of a better name,
a monarch who fundamentally

00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:13.699
rules and everybody is subject
to him.

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:17.457
He has an aristocracy around
him, he has a lot of helpers,

00:58:17.457 --> 00:58:20.951
but he's the boss and that's
what you see in the world

00:58:20.951 --> 00:58:25.349
everywhere else.
After that, if you examine as

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:31.613
best we can the cities of the
Dark Ages and ask what kind of

00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:35.256
government,
if you want to use that word,

00:58:35.256 --> 00:58:39.495
would these communities have
had, you probably wouldn't do

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:43.436
badly if you looked at the
Odyssey for the best

00:58:43.436 --> 00:58:46.578
clues you could find.
Of course, they won't be

00:58:46.578 --> 00:58:49.500
perfect, there's a mixed
character of the world of Homer,

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:54.730
but still, if you look at the
world of Odysseus,

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:58.960
his home, what's going on in
Ithaca,

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.559
there are some valuable clues.
There is somebody in that

00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:10.699
world called a basileus,
who is a single individual who

00:59:10.699 --> 00:59:16.940
is understood to be superior in
some way to everybody else.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.500
However, he's not very superior
to everybody else.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.738
He has all of these noblemen
around him, all of whom claim to

00:59:25.738 --> 00:59:28.051
be basileis,
as you recall,

00:59:28.051 --> 00:59:31.757
and a fairer way to put this
would be that this is largely an

00:59:31.757 --> 00:59:35.027
aristocratic society,
that was our conclusion after

00:59:35.027 --> 00:59:38.418
we looked at the poems of Homer,
and I think that's what

00:59:38.418 --> 00:59:44.349
continues,
even after the world of Mycenae.

00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:48.177
People who had power by virtue
of their wealth,

00:59:48.177 --> 00:59:52.670
by virtue of their personal
physical strength maybe,

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:55.996
by virtue of their descent
because people always have

00:59:55.996 --> 00:59:58.940
theories about individuals in
their society,

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.605
I mean early societies,
who were born to the purple so

01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:05.579
to speak, but whatever the
criteria were,

01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:10.237
and birth always was a critical
criterion in the days of the

01:00:10.237 --> 01:00:13.621
aristocracies,
you would have aristocracies

01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:18.092
who would have the practical,
the de facto control of

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.378
things.
Well, by definition,

01:00:20.378 --> 01:00:23.945
an aristocracy is plural not
singular, so how do you make

01:00:23.945 --> 01:00:27.545
decisions in an aristocracy?
The answer, typically,

01:00:27.545 --> 01:00:30.517
is a council.
I use the word council,

01:00:30.517 --> 01:00:33.465
the Greek word is
boulē,

01:00:33.465 --> 01:00:37.831
and not assembly,
which in Greek comes to be

01:00:37.831 --> 01:00:43.195
called ecclesia,
because an ecclesia is

01:00:43.195 --> 01:00:48.559
understood to be a gathering of
the entire adult male

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:52.235
population,
and a boulē is

01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:55.741
understood to be not a gathering
of the whole,

01:00:55.741 --> 01:01:00.650
but rather a smaller group who
has some degree of authority,

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.530
and I would have suggested that
in the earliest days they had

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.902
all the authority that mattered.
However, it's interesting that

01:01:08.902 --> 01:01:13.103
these Greek communities from a
very early time seem to have

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:16.797
been different from the
Mycenaean kinds of things by

01:01:16.797 --> 01:01:21.143
virtue of the fact that the men
who fought in the army always

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:24.837
seemed to have had to be
consulted when it came to a

01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:28.735
question of fighting,
and so you always had an

01:01:28.735 --> 01:01:31.539
assembly, even in an
aristocratic state,

01:01:31.539 --> 01:01:35.349
but decisions in general were
made by aristocrats.

01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:39.547
Moreover, the law was
interpreted, spoken,

01:01:39.547 --> 01:01:45.383
and to the degree it had to be
enforced by the aristocrats

01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:50.400
working through a council in
their community,

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.745
and these councils might have
been elective from within the

01:01:55.745 --> 01:02:00.445
aristocracy or they could have
been simply the whole

01:02:00.445 --> 01:02:03.746
aristocracy,
depending really on the size of

01:02:03.746 --> 01:02:05.985
the community,
because you can't have a

01:02:05.985 --> 01:02:09.344
council functioning to any
useful purpose if it gets to be

01:02:09.344 --> 01:02:12.370
too big;
it just becomes something else.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:14.730
That's where you start;
that's the Dark Ages.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:19.614
Now, what we shall see as the
polis grows and develops,

01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:24.018
and as these changes in the
economic situation that I've

01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:28.765
described are happening,
is that these successful

01:02:28.765 --> 01:02:33.255
farmers, as I will be telling
you next time,

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:38.684
who also will be the fighting
men who fight for their

01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:44.531
polis as infantrymen when
the infantry becomes the

01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:49.230
critically important part of the
army.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.930
These men, the combination of
their independence,

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.362
their wealth--when I say wealth
I don't mean great wealth--but

01:02:55.362 --> 01:02:57.500
the fact that they do have
wealth,

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.792
that they amount to something,
and their role as soldiers

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:09.030
makes them demand a larger voice
in the government of the state,

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:13.050
in the decisions that affect
them so closely.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:16.352
So, there will be a whole--I'm
looking ahead now,

01:03:16.352 --> 01:03:20.342
projecting into some topics
that we'll explore more closely

01:03:20.342 --> 01:03:23.966
later.
They will be finding different

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:29.155
ways to insist on their
inclusion and the results will

01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:34.144
be different in every state.
Sometimes the old

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:39.914
aristocracy will be able to hold
on for a very long time and to

01:03:39.914 --> 01:03:43.730
suppress any attempt to change
things.

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:46.922
Other times,
and this will be widespread in

01:03:46.922 --> 01:03:50.420
certain places and will be very
significant,

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:54.856
the dissatisfied people in the
society, mainly these farmers

01:03:54.856 --> 01:03:58.426
I'm talking about,
will get together and perhaps

01:03:58.426 --> 01:04:02.059
fix on some discontented
aristocratic individuals,

01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:06.279
and most particularly pick some
aristocrat who has distinguished

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:09.976
himself typically as a soldier,
as a leader of troops,

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:13.150
and engage really in what
amounts to a kind of a

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:18.159
revolution or at least a coup,
and bring about a different

01:04:18.159 --> 01:04:23.719
kind of a monarchy which the
Greeks called a tyranny.

01:04:23.719 --> 01:04:27.486
When these tyrannies take
place, they last for different

01:04:27.486 --> 01:04:30.909
periods of time,
but when the tyrant is removed,

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:34.914
what follows after that is,
there is never again in that

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:39.881
town a one-man rule of any kind.
Either what is established

01:04:39.881 --> 01:04:44.961
after the tyranny is an
oligarchy, but notice I didn't

01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:49.183
say an aristocracy.
An oligarchy just means rule of

01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:52.320
the few, but as we shall see
what changes is,

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.802
is it is no longer the rule of
those few who are born in the

01:04:57.802 --> 01:05:03.377
right place, it will be based
upon the wealth of those people

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:07.280
and that means that the newly
wealthy,

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.501
or the newly well,
that is, the reasonably

01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:15.216
well-off will participate in
their government and the form of

01:05:15.216 --> 01:05:20.009
government which is oligarchy
will be throughout the classical

01:05:20.009 --> 01:05:24.881
period the most characteristic
form of government in Greek city

01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.022
states.
When democracy is invented it

01:05:28.022 --> 01:05:31.879
will have its moment and it will
spread, and there will be

01:05:31.879 --> 01:05:35.803
numerous democracies but they
will never be the majority of

01:05:35.803 --> 01:05:41.037
the poleis.
Your typical polis will

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:48.148
be a kind of a Hanson farmer
outfit, where people from that

01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:52.542
class and up,
will participate in politics,

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:57.576
will be the governing bodies in
their state, they will be the

01:05:57.576 --> 01:06:02.526
ones who continue to fight in
that infantry that is decisive

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:06.571
for the state,
and they will be the ones who

01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:10.459
make decisions,
and the people poorer than them

01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:14.291
will be excluded.
So, it's very important to

01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:18.655
realize that these family
farmers, who are successful,

01:06:18.655 --> 01:06:21.949
do not necessarily lead to
democracy.

01:06:21.949 --> 01:06:25.751
Indeed, I want to emphasize
again, it is an unusual outcome

01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:29.565
when they end up with democracy.
So now we've said something

01:06:29.565 --> 01:06:32.972
about the economic change and
something about the political

01:06:32.972 --> 01:06:34.615
change,
and next hour,

01:06:34.615 --> 01:06:39.062
I'll start with the story of
the military change that has so

01:06:39.062 --> 01:06:42.000
many significant consequences.
Okay.

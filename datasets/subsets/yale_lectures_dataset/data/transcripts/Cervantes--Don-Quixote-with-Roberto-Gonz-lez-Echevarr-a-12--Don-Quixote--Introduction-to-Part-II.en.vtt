00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.167
Prof: Today,
I'm going to talk about the

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.970
transition from Part I to Part
II of the Quixote;

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.140
our transition,
not Cervantes's transition.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.418
Remember that he didn't know
for sure that he was going to

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.070
write a second part.
 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.890
Of course, when he wrote the
second part,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.397
he knew for sure that he had
written Part I and it is a

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:31.698
transition for us,
and also a transition in his

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:36.976
life, but not one that was
envisioned when Part I was being

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.160
conceived.
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.747
I underline that fact;
I have said it several times,

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:45.419
because the illusion is created
that it is one book by the fact

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:47.670
that this it is all bound
together.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.482
You will see today that they
are quite different as books,

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:54.960
because we will be seeing the
title pages of them.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.110
I will begin by reviewing what
I call the grand themes of

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.390
criticism regarding Part I
before moving on to Part II.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.129
Now, the first of those grand
themes, number one,

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.390
is ambiguity and perspectivism.
 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.870
This is a review session as it
were.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.080
Leo Spitzer,
whom you will be meeting in a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.995
week or so when you read his
very fine piece in the

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:32.069
Casebook called
"Linguistic Perspectivism

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.750
in Don Quixote"
says the following--

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.730
I'm only going to talk about
his conclusions,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.349
we will talk more about how he
comes to those conclusion after

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.733
you have read his piece;
but I need to go over his

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.470
conclusions.
 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.030
He says: "This means that,
in our novel,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.653
[meaning the Quixote]
things are represented not for

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:59.140
what they are in themselves,
but only as things spoken about

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.040
or thought about;
and this involves breaking the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.239
narrative presentation into two
points of view.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.969
There can be no certainty about
the 'unbroken' reality of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.572
events;
the only unquestionable truth

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:15.645
on which the reader may depend
is the will of the artist who

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:19.306
chose to break up a multivalent
reality into different

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.550
perspectives.
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.613
In other words,
perspectivism suggests an

00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:27.060
Archimedean principle outside of
the plot--

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.613
and the Archimedes must be
Cervantes himself [meaning the

00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:34.025
Archimedean principle,
the focus, the center,

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.930
the fulcrum is Cervantes
himself,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.008
who has created this
perspective.]"

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.651
Spitzer adds:
"And we may see in

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:46.272
Cervantes' two-fold treatment of
the problem of nicknames [which

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:49.281
he studies in great detail in
his article]

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:53.537
another example of his baroque
attitude [we will be talking

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:57.498
about the Baroque extensively in
the next few lectures]

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:00.520
what is true,
what is a dream?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.599
[this is one of the topics of
the baroque]--this time,

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.810
[continues Spitzer]
toward language.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.644
Is not human language,
also, vanitas vanitatum,

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:13.117
the vanity of vanities [he is
quoting, of course,

00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:17.042
scripture.]"
That's the end of Spitzer,

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:21.884
and we saw that Ciriaco
Morón Arroyo--whose name

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:26.460
you have heard before--what he
said about irony.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.250
I'm repeating a quote that you
heard in a previous lecture.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.882
He says: "I agree with
Spitzer's definition of

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:33.620
Cervantean perspectivism."
 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.706
And now he quotes Spitzer,
who says: "In terms of

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:41.639
morals Cervantes is no way a
perspectivist."

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.549
That's the end of the Spitzer
quote within the Morón

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.560
Arroyo quote.
 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.217
In a note, Morón Arroyo
continues: "He adds:

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:52.878
'Perhaps we ought to point out
here'--

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.220
[this is Ciriaco Morón
Arroyo]--

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.444
'perhaps we ought to point out
here that perspectivism is

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.860
inherent to Christian thought.
 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.085
Perspectivism is in the sense
of a form of modesty that

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:10.780
recognizes the limits of all
judgment and human knowledge;

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.936
is indeed a Christian humility
and intelligence in the

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:18.387
strictest sense,
the capacity to perceive the

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:21.290
limit of our own
creations."

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.149
And then he uses the Greek word
for irony, ironea.

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:28.072
So perspectivism,
this partial view that creates

00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:31.490
this irony and so forth,
Morón Arroyo underlines,

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.730
is a very Christian
perspective.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.459
I would add that the
self-assurance of the

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:43.190
Renaissance is being eroded and
the ordered cosmos of the Middle

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.920
Ages has long disappeared.
 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.668
Now, that is the first of the
grand themes:

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:53.240
ambiguity, perspectivism and so
forth.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.096
The second of the grand themes
is that the self can impose its

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:03.819
will on reality,
but only to a certain extent,

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.810
and the self is defined--
that self is defined--by the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.850
agonistic struggle to do so to
impose its will on reality.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:23.358
Captain Ahab in Melville's Moby
Dick is the most obvious modern

00:05:23.358 --> 00:05:27.524
example in fiction;
also, of course,

00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:30.062
an heir of Don
Quixote--Melville was a great

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:31.420
reader of Cervantes.
 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.889
Remember, in this context of
imposing our will on reality,

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.839
what I said about how we invent
our beloveds when in love,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.653
that is part of this willful
imposition of ourselves on

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:49.730
reality.
 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.091
Now, why is doubt such an
integral part of what we could

00:05:56.091 --> 00:06:01.180
call the aesthetics of the
Quixote?

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.459
How can doubt be a positive
value?

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:09.730
The book gives a substance to
the sense of doubt brought about

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.829
by the scientific discoveries
and philosophical ideas of the

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:15.778
period.
 

00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:18.670
It enacts doubts,
the Quixote.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.339
It dramatizes it.
 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:25.079
It is the modern condition.
 

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:29.958
Remember what I mentioned about
Copernicus, Galileo,

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:35.122
the fact that mankind is no
longer at the center of the

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:38.374
world;
the earth is no longer at the

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:42.646
center of the universe,
and this has brought about this

00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:44.069
sense of doubt.
 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.889
There is doubt--continuing with
this second grand theme--

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.160
there is doubt about the
veracity of texts,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.529
the capacity of texts to convey
the truth,

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.930
including, and most
prominently, the Bible,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.512
or the Bible as
interpreted by the Catholic

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:05.170
Church.
 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.596
Such doubt was not only
prevalent among protestant

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:15.649
thinkers but also among catholic
ones, like Erasmus of Rotterdam.

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:21.266
Erasmus is one of these great
Renaissance figures that I have

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:26.040
mentioned as being important for
Cervantes' time.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.961
The humanists,
and Erasmus was one,

00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.269
were philologists.
 

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.180
Philologist means,
'lover of language,'

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.940
'philo-logos,' lover of
language,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.271
students of language,
particularly classical

00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:45.250
languages,
like Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.293
Chairs for the study of these
languages were created in Spain

00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:53.490
at the University of
Alcalá,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.684
for instance,
that town where Cervantes

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.470
happens to have been born,
by the way.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.754
Humanists, like Erasmus,
wanted to read scripture in the

00:08:04.754 --> 00:08:09.639
original Hebrew and Greek,
Hebrew, the Old Testament,

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:12.761
Greek, the New Testament,
and challenge St.

00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:16.634
Jerome's official Latin Bible;
they wanted to do their own

00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:18.089
translations of the
Bible.

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:24.711
The Church didn't like this at
all, and the erasmians in Spain

00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.269
were persecuted,
but there is an underlying

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:33.830
erasmian subtext in most of
Cervantes.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.572
The humanists,
like Erasmus,

00:08:37.572 --> 00:08:42.346
wanted to say,
the reading of this word in

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:47.720
Saint Jerome's Latin version of
the Bible is wrong,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.916
it should be this,
and, of course,

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:53.509
changing that word changes the
meaning of the text,

00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:58.577
so there was doubt about the
sacred texts which spills over

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:01.808
into doubt about texts in
general,

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:06.485
and about language,
and we certainly have echoes of

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:09.759
this throughout Cervantes's
work.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.701
There is also,
continuing with the second

00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:17.840
grand theme of doubt,
ontological doubt;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.527
doubt about who one is,
which is an encouragement to

00:09:22.527 --> 00:09:25.794
self creation,
to self fashioning,

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:30.231
to self invention,
as Stephen Greenblatt calls it

00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:34.460
in his book Renaissance Self
Fashioning.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.759
In the Quixote there are
many characters,

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.399
we have seen,
who invent themselves,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:44.009
not just Don Quixote:
Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:47.570
Marcela, Dorotea as Princess
Micomicona,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.168
and so forth.
 

00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:52.629
Doubt leads to
pondering--pondering comes from

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:55.320
pondus,
in Latin, 'weigh';

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.864
so pondering is to weigh the
difference possibilities,

00:10:00.864 --> 00:10:05.990
the different alternatives to
being, to action.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.289
Self-doubt is the precondition
to inventiveness,

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:13.308
to the play of the imagination.
 

00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:17.034
It is the gateway to freedom,
which is one of the main themes

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:20.077
of the Quixote,
as I have been pointing out

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.009
throughout.
 

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:27.980
Doubt leads to vicarious lives
lived through literature,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
as in the cases of Don Quixote
and Marcela,

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.519
for instance and many others
that you will meet in Part II.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:38.383
This is, again,
I underline,

00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:40.659
the freedom of the imagination.
 

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.840
Why do we want to become others?
 

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.298
In the age of myths we wanted
to be gods;

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:52.740
in the modern age,
we want to be heroes,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.168
like Don Quixote wanted to be
one of the chivalric heroes and

00:10:58.168 --> 00:11:03.144
like people today want to be
James Bond or such a modern

00:11:03.144 --> 00:11:03.960
hero.
 

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.448
Dissatisfaction with the world,
the world that is unstable

00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:12.702
leads to a desire to make it
other and to make one self

00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:15.229
other,
and this very much at the core

00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:17.830
of the Quixote from the
very beginning.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:25.307
Now, the third of the grand
themes that I'm reviewing as we

00:11:25.307 --> 00:11:28.788
conclude Part I;
reading.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:31.734
The Quixote is a book
about reading,

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:35.450
and its protagonist is first
and foremost a reader.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.288
But there are many readers in
the book,

00:11:38.288 --> 00:11:40.190
like Marcela,
Grisóstomo,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.136
Cardenio, and even the poor
trooper who has trouble reading

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:48.996
the order of arrest,
as we saw in that hilarious

00:11:48.996 --> 00:11:49.490
scene.
 

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.129
The Quixote,
the book, the Quixote,

00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:58.009
encourages the reader to look
for stories not told,

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:03.149
or told indirectly by means of
other stories,

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:05.009
or imbedded in other stories.
 

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:08.086
It is a book,
the Quixote,

00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:12.317
that is a lesson in reading,
in interpreting,

00:12:12.317 --> 00:12:14.528
in the broad sense.
 

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:18.386
There are so many scenes in
which interpretations are

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:22.690
challenged, interpretations by
various characters clash.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.330
The pleasure of reading
involves the discovery,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.340
the teasing out of these
sub-textual stories,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.139
as we saw when we talked about
Cardenio's story,

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:40.490
and as we saw when talked about
Princess Micomicona's story.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.184
This is also a lesson for life
that one can learn in the

00:12:46.184 --> 00:12:47.558
Quixote.
 

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:53.441
The fourth of the grand themes
is that characters are

00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:59.322
relational, not static,
that they develop in relation

00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:01.360
to each other.
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.986
A given to us today,
this was an innovation in

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:10.297
the Quixote,
an innovation developed from

00:13:10.297 --> 00:13:13.259
the picaresque,
where there is character

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.340
development in fiction for the
first time.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.090
In the Celestina there
is some of that already,

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:26.220
1499, but this begins to
develop with the picaresque,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.942
Lazarillo,
1554, the

00:13:27.942 --> 00:13:30.860
Guzmán, and
so forth.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.580
Characters influence each other.
 

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.541
The mutual influence and
transformation take place by

00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:42.503
virtue of the dialogue,
which posits that the self is

00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:45.779
relational and dependent on the
others.

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:49.668
This is evident in one of the
truly grand themes about the

00:13:49.668 --> 00:13:52.779
Quixote started by Salvador
de Madariaga,

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:57.208
which is the theme of the
quixotization of Sancho and the

00:13:57.208 --> 00:14:01.966
sanchification of Don Quixote,
meaning that Sancho is

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:06.186
influenced by his master,
and that Don Quixote is

00:14:06.186 --> 00:14:07.980
influenced by his squire.
 

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:16.538
The most obvious modern example
of this for me is a book and a

00:14:16.538 --> 00:14:24.533
film called The Kiss of the
Spider Woman, by

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:29.714
Manuel Puig,
the Argentine writer,

00:14:29.714 --> 00:14:36.500
where there are two fellows in
jail in Argentina,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.639
one a political activist and
the other a homosexual,

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:43.304
and the whole story is how the
homosexual transforms the

00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:48.308
political activist by telling
him the stories of movies,

00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:57.558
and it's a very moving film
with a very quixotic structure

00:14:57.558 --> 00:15:00.285
to it,
these two characters talking

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:00.918
and so forth.
 

00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:03.610
Now, Don Fernando's
transformation,

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.514
as well as that of Dorotea is a
prime example of this evolution

00:15:08.514 --> 00:15:09.940
of characters.
 

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.677
In addition,
we have seen that characters

00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:16.385
can invent themselves,
identities, and have adventures

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:19.668
in their new roles and within
those new fictions,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.940
as in the case of Princess
Micomicona;

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.778
we will meet others who do the
same in Part II.

00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:31.821
The fifth of the grand themes
of criticism--and this is mostly

00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:38.158
my own grand theme about the
Quixote--is improvisation.

00:15:38.158 --> 00:15:42.368
I have talked several times
about improvisation in the

00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:43.418
Quixote.
 

00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:50.259
My Random House gives
two meanings to 'improvise.'

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:53.903
One: "to prepare or
provide offhand or hastily,

00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:57.190
extemporize [Well,
actually, four meanings];

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:03.365
to compose verse,
music, on the spur of the

00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:05.094
moment;
[three]

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.058
to recite, sing
extemporaneously;

00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:09.539
[and four]
to compose utter or execute

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:11.820
anything extemporaneously."
 

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.220
The Dictionary of the
Spanish Academy says

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.480
tersely: "hacer una cosa
de pronto,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.481
sin estudio ni
preparación alguna

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.903
[to make or do something
suddenly without study or

00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:28.931
preparation.]"
Improvisation has something to

00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:33.211
do with bricoler,
a concept that was very popular

00:16:33.211 --> 00:16:35.889
during the heyday of
structuralism,

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:39.023
and that means,
according to my Robert:

00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:42.210
"Installer,
aménager en amateur et

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.720
avec ingeniosité...
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.779
Arranger, réparer tant
bien que mal,

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:47.298
de façon provisoire...
 

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.841
Arranger pour falsifier [To
install something,

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:52.722
to provide or arrange for
something amateurishly and

00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:53.740
ingeniously...
 

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.870
To fix or repair something more
or less in a provisional way...

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.268
To fix something up to falsify
it or pass it off for something

00:17:01.268 --> 00:17:03.792
else.]"
To improvise has,

00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:06.597
on the one hand,
a positive side:

00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:11.230
it is a boast of skill to be
able to do something without a

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.202
model or plan,
but it also has a negative

00:17:14.202 --> 00:17:17.920
side, because the product of
improvisation is usually shoddy,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.028
imperfect, fragile and
provisional.

00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:24.453
We have seen that there is a
great deal of implicit

00:17:24.453 --> 00:17:28.700
improvisation in Part I of
the Quixote thematically,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.819
as it were, meaning that things
and actions are described which

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:33.950
are improvised.
 

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.354
I gave Juan Palomeque's inn as
an example of this because it is

00:17:38.354 --> 00:17:41.710
made up of patchwork,
carried out over time

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:46.663
haphazardly, but I also pointed
out features of the novel itself

00:17:46.663 --> 00:17:50.828
that seem to betray their
improvised construction.

00:17:50.828 --> 00:17:54.679
They are notorious cervantine
oversights, such as the

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:58.454
disappearance of Sancho's
donkey, but there are many

00:17:58.454 --> 00:17:59.269
others.
 

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:01.108
For instance,
I don't know if you noticed,

00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:05.808
that Cervantes pulls out of his
hat at the end,

00:18:05.808 --> 00:18:08.920
that the innkeeper,
that Juan Palomeque,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.009
was a trooper of the Holy
Brotherhood,

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:16.589
something that goes unmentioned
during the earlier episode in

00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:19.566
the inn,
when Juan Palomeque puts out a

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:24.054
candle to prevent a trooper from
finding out what is going on in

00:18:24.054 --> 00:18:25.548
his establishment.
 

00:18:25.548 --> 00:18:28.838
How come, if was a trooper
himself?

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:33.348
Are these lapses on the part of
Cervantes or part of the

00:18:33.348 --> 00:18:35.400
aesthetics of the book?
 

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.980
I would like to think that it
is part of the aesthetics of the

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.737
book,
and that the air of

00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:44.599
improvisation is very much
inline with the book's informal

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:47.878
tone,
with the fact that its origin

00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:53.680
is presumably a found manuscript
whose discovery is episodic,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.358
and whose redaction seems to be
concomitant with the action,

00:18:59.358 --> 00:19:01.951
and the reading,
most notoriously,

00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:03.130
the prologue.
 

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:08.550
The prologue dramatizes the
process of improvisation because

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.868
it tells how it is being
laboriously written;

00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:18.674
the prologue sets the tone for
the book, and it is also its

00:19:18.674 --> 00:19:22.578
defining epilogue,
as I said earlier.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:26.233
It is an ode to improvisation,
to an imperfection,

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:29.890
qualities, to which the author
resigns himself.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.798
Remember that Menéndez
Pidal,

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.670
in the piece that you read,
attributes improvisation to the

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.150
Spanish character--
he says this with resignation;

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.054
he is a Spaniard,
since he was a Spaniard

00:19:42.054 --> 00:19:44.108
himself;
and E.C. Riley,

00:19:44.108 --> 00:19:48.318
a British Hispanist who loved
Spain,

00:19:48.318 --> 00:19:51.944
admiringly compares the
improvisation in the

00:19:51.944 --> 00:19:56.279
Quixote to bullfighting and
to flamenco dancing,

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.382
which are activities in which
improvisation is the order of

00:20:00.382 --> 00:20:01.088
the day.
 

00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:04.010
I believe that it is a
theoretical statement on the

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.288
part of Cervantes which he
proposes,

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:10.730
again, in chapter V of the 1615
Quixote--

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.038
the second part--when he has
the translator apologize,

00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:18.321
and you will get to that
chapter, for transcribing a text

00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:21.839
in which Sancho does not sound
like himself;

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:24.068
he sounds too learned.
 

00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:28.608
This is a text that undoes
itself as it is being read;

00:20:28.608 --> 00:20:32.400
it is also a critique of
mimesis, of representation;

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.623
it is an improvisation made
from what there is,

00:20:35.623 --> 00:20:39.617
and that the translator and
transcriber passed on resigned

00:20:39.617 --> 00:20:41.160
its imperfections.
 

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.227
All of this is connected to the
themes that I mentioned before

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:52.500
about doubt, self doubt and
linguistic uncertainty.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.721
How can my poor self create
something perfect and enduring

00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:04.180
in language given what I have
said about doubt,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.109
self doubt and the instability
of language as conceived by the

00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:10.078
humanists?
 

00:21:10.078 --> 00:21:18.278
The whole thing also opens the
question of temporality,

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:22.057
about this text that says,
well, it doesn't sound like

00:21:22.057 --> 00:21:24.268
Sancho,
I transcribe it because it is

00:21:24.268 --> 00:21:25.868
my duty to do so and so forth.
 

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:28.615
In what moment,
or at what moment,

00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:33.777
does the text exist in relation
to the originals in which it is

00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:34.608
based?
 

00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:38.732
One solution,
perhaps the only solution is to

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:44.170
say that the text exists only at
the moment of reading,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.185
of each reading,
and that is a very modern

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:53.867
current conception of textuality
that is already present in

00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:55.240
Cervantes.
 

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.263
So these are the grand themes
that I wanted to review with you

00:22:00.263 --> 00:22:01.500
about Part I.
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.420
And now, we move to Part II.
 

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.190
1615, ten years,
a whole decade has elapsed.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:16.932
Cervantes was an instant
success with Don Quixote,

00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:20.798
and he moved to Madrid in 1616.
 

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:24.961
Publishers become interested in
his work and he brings out the

00:22:24.961 --> 00:22:28.496
Novelas ejemplares,
The Exemplary Stories

00:22:28.496 --> 00:22:31.940
that you have in 1613,
and Ocho comedias y ocho

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.282
entremeses,
Eight Plays and Eight

00:22:35.282 --> 00:22:38.973
Interludes in 1615,
the same year that the second

00:22:38.973 --> 00:22:42.700
Quixote appears,
and I have a page here that you

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.377
have read,
but I want to read again,

00:22:45.377 --> 00:22:48.490
from Durán's book
Cervantes,

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.775
and from the little
biographical chapter at the

00:22:52.775 --> 00:22:58.270
beginning that I reproduced in
my Casebook so that we

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.598
have a synoptic view.
 

00:23:00.598 --> 00:23:02.788
"In 1606 [Durán
goes]

00:23:02.788 --> 00:23:06.278
the Court settled again in
Madrid [and you have been

00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:09.633
following in Elliott the
migrations of the Spanish

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:13.259
Court]: Cervantes and his family
moved with it.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.473
Cervantes wanted to be in touch
with other writers and was

00:23:16.473 --> 00:23:19.894
looking for new publishers;
the women in his household,

00:23:19.894 --> 00:23:22.737
busy with fashion,
designing and sewing were

00:23:22.737 --> 00:23:24.390
looking for customers.
 

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.430
Miguel's last years in Madrid
were relatively serene.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.538
He overcame through patience
and wisdom all of his

00:23:31.538 --> 00:23:34.730
adversities,
the neglect of famous writers

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.574
such as Lope de Vega--
who seldom had a good word for

00:23:38.574 --> 00:23:41.400
his works--
and the sadness of family

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.875
crises;
his daughter married but soon

00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:50.548
became the mistress of a wealthy
middle-aged businessman;

00:23:50.548 --> 00:23:54.026
when Cervantes intervened in
the interest of preventing

00:23:54.026 --> 00:23:57.890
scandal, she became estranged
and never again visited him.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.828
Cervantes immersed himself in
his work.

00:24:00.828 --> 00:24:05.769
It was harvest season for him:
late in life,

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:09.076
yet in full command of his
talent, he produced in quick

00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:11.650
succession his Exemplary
Novels,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.900
1613, the second part of Don
Quixote 1615,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.848
and finally Persiles y
Sigismunda,

00:24:16.848 --> 00:24:22.250
a novel which his imagination
and his love for adventure found

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.259
almost limitless in scope."
 

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:28.491
And he adds,
quoting Ángel del

00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:31.961
Río,
a great Hispanist who was a

00:24:31.961 --> 00:24:36.058
professor at Columbia University
for many years,

00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.834
and who in the forties
published a great history of

00:24:38.834 --> 00:24:40.000
Spanish literature.
 

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.316
Durán goes:
"Objectively,

00:24:42.316 --> 00:24:45.019
Cervantes' life was not a
success story.

00:24:45.019 --> 00:24:48.700
He was seldom in full control:
he was too poor;

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.450
for many years he lacked public
recognition.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.545
Yet, as Ángel del
Río points out [and here

00:24:54.545 --> 00:24:56.910
he quotes Ángel del
Río],

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.494
'there is no reason to lament
Cervantes' misfortunes nor the

00:25:00.494 --> 00:25:02.380
mediocrity of his daily life.
 

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.855
He could thus,
through an experience which is

00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:08.288
seldom obtained when the writer
is successful and wealthy,

00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:12.431
know, observe and feel the beat
of Spanish life in its greatness

00:25:12.431 --> 00:25:15.544
and its poverty,
in its heroic fantasy and in

00:25:15.544 --> 00:25:18.338
the sad reality of an imminent
decadence.

00:25:18.338 --> 00:25:22.047
He was to leave in his books
the most faithful image of this

00:25:22.047 --> 00:25:23.633
life,
reflected in multiple

00:25:23.633 --> 00:25:26.211
perspectives with bittersweet
irony and penetrating

00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:29.967
humor.'"
So this moment,

00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:40.519
where the beginning of the
decline of the Spanish empire

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:45.414
begins,
and so to also have a very

00:25:45.414 --> 00:25:51.317
clear vision of this moment,
I want to read a text that

00:25:51.317 --> 00:25:57.519
presumably you have also ready
from Imperial Spain,

00:25:57.519 --> 00:26:02.278
Elliott's marvelous book which
I do,

00:26:02.278 --> 00:26:08.842
do hope that you read,
and he goes as follows on

00:26:08.842 --> 00:26:12.297
page--
this is 319,320 of your Penguin

00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:16.952
Classics edition--
He has been talking about how

00:26:16.952 --> 00:26:22.400
the writers could find sponsors
for their work,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.597
and so forth:
"At the same time,

00:26:25.597 --> 00:26:29.394
the moral and emotional
involvement of the intellectuals

00:26:29.394 --> 00:26:32.986
in the tragic fate of their
native land seems to have

00:26:32.986 --> 00:26:37.051
provided an additional stimulus,
given an extra degree of

00:26:37.051 --> 00:26:40.718
intensity to their imagination
and diverting it into rewarding

00:26:40.718 --> 00:26:41.980
creative channels.
 

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.118
[Ironically,
a moment of crisis can create a

00:26:45.118 --> 00:26:48.404
great literature.]
This was especially true of

00:26:48.404 --> 00:26:51.009
Cervantes,
[says Elliot]

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:58.368
whose life--from 1547 to 1616--
spans the two ages of imperial

00:26:58.368 --> 00:27:02.009
triumph and imperial retreat.
 

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:05.375
[This is the important
sentence, spans the two ages of

00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:07.788
imperial triumph and imperial
retreat.]

00:27:07.788 --> 00:27:11.090
The crisis of the late
sixteenth century cuts through

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.220
the life of Cervantes as it cut
through the life of Spain,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.400
separating the days of heroism
from the days of

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.756
desengaño [this is
a word that we will be visiting

00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:27.607
again during the semester,
'to be undeceived'.]

00:27:27.607 --> 00:27:34.512
Somehow Cervantes magically
held the balance between

00:27:34.512 --> 00:27:39.605
optimism and pessimism,
enthusiasm and irony,

00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:43.022
but he illustrates what was to
be the most striking

00:27:43.022 --> 00:27:46.372
characteristic of
seventeenth-century literary and

00:27:46.372 --> 00:27:50.009
artistic production--
that deep cleavage between the

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:52.548
two worlds of the spirit and the
flesh,

00:27:52.548 --> 00:27:57.900
which co-exist and yet are
forever separate.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.528
This constant dualism between
the spirit and the flesh,

00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:04.230
the dream and the reality
belonged very much to

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.519
seventeenth century European
civilization as a whole,

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:12.118
but it seems to have attained
an intensity in Spain that it

00:28:12.118 --> 00:28:14.338
rarely achieved elsewhere.
 

00:28:14.338 --> 00:28:21.528
It is apparent in the writings
of Calderón [de la Barca,

00:28:21.528 --> 00:28:23.080
whose name I have mentioned
before]

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.406
and the portraits of
Velázquez [whose work we

00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:29.276
have seen and continue to see],
and it prompted the bitter

00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:32.960
satires of Quevedo [Francisco de
Quevedo,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:40.450
one of the great writers of the
Spanish seventeenth century.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:45.348
He is quoting here Quevedo.]
'There are many things here

00:28:45.348 --> 00:28:49.180
that seem to exist and have
their being,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.810
and yet they are nothing more
than a name and an appearance,'

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.900
Quevedo wrote at the end of this
life.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.178
[...]
Was the reality of Spanish

00:28:59.178 --> 00:29:03.587
experience to be found in the
heroic imperialism of Charles V

00:29:03.587 --> 00:29:07.190
or in the humiliating pacifism
of Philip III?

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.470
In the world of Don Quixote,
or the world of Sancho Panza?

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.940
Confused at once by its own
past and its own present,

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.548
the Castile of Philip III--the
land of arbitristas--

00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:25.680
sought desperately for an
answer."

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.968
Arbitristas,
you will meet in the first

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:36.502
chapters of Part II--
from arbitrio,

00:29:36.502 --> 00:29:44.190
which was an opinion--
Arbitristas were people

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:49.366
who offered advice to the
government on matters of the

00:29:49.366 --> 00:29:52.848
economy,
on military matters;

00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:54.460
some of their advice was really
outlandish.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.000
These are the people who
developed into today's

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.069
economists,
the ones who have brought us to

00:30:01.069 --> 00:30:04.859
the present crisis-is what I
always think of when I think of

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:06.528
the arbitristas.
 

00:30:06.528 --> 00:30:09.798
You will be meeting them,
as I said,

00:30:09.798 --> 00:30:13.654
at the beginning of Part II,
when the characters discuss

00:30:13.654 --> 00:30:16.880
them and discus some of this
advice to the--

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.993
and Don Quixote himself act as
an arbitrista by giving

00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:27.278
some advice on how to take care
of the threat of the Turks,

00:30:27.278 --> 00:30:33.358
coming down again after the
defeat in Lepanto.

00:30:33.358 --> 00:30:39.686
So we are not responsible for
answering the question of what

00:30:39.686 --> 00:30:43.736
happened in Spain,
why was it different,

00:30:43.736 --> 00:30:48.184
but we are responsible for
seeing the effects of this

00:30:48.184 --> 00:30:51.950
crisis as reflected in
Cervantes's work,

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:58.832
and I wanted you to have a
clear view of these two ages of

00:30:58.832 --> 00:31:05.107
empire,
one of triumph and one of

00:31:05.107 --> 00:31:06.730
defeat.
 

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:19.715
Now, the second part,
let us look at the various

00:31:19.715 --> 00:31:25.885
titles,
the title page that we saw of

00:31:25.885 --> 00:31:31.069
the 1605 Quixote,
the title page of the 1615

00:31:31.069 --> 00:31:35.824
Quixote, and the
title page of the Avellaneda

00:31:35.824 --> 00:31:37.298
Quixote.
 

00:31:37.298 --> 00:31:40.594
He's known by his second last
name, as some people are,

00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:42.788
and you have to remember his
name;

00:31:42.788 --> 00:31:46.039
you will see it complete now on
the screen...

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:53.298
Avellaneda.
 

00:31:53.298 --> 00:31:57.450
Because the two things that
have happened to Cervantes since

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.368
the publication of 1605,
the most important things is

00:32:00.368 --> 00:32:01.680
the success of the
Quixote,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.430
and in 1614 the appearance of
an apocryphal Quixote

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.118
published by Avellaneda.
 

00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:13.771
Now, this is the title page of
the 1605 Quixote,

00:32:13.771 --> 00:32:18.077
the one we have just finished;
Part I, as is known:

00:32:18.077 --> 00:32:21.641
"El ingenioso hidalgo
don Quixote de la

00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:23.190
Mancha."
 

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.969
Remember we went over each one
of those words in one of my

00:32:25.969 --> 00:32:26.750
first classes.
 

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:34.068
Now, we go to the title page of
the 1615 Quixote,

00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:37.788
and you see:
"Segunda parte

00:32:37.788 --> 00:32:44.049
del ingenioso caballero don
Quixote de la Mancha."

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:48.577
There has been a major change;
he's no longer an

00:32:48.577 --> 00:32:53.384
hidalgo,
now he is a caballero:

00:32:53.384 --> 00:32:58.410
"Por Miguel de
Cervantes Saavedra,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.970
autor de la primera
parte:"

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.529
By Miguel de Cervantes
Saavedra,

00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:04.200
author of the first part.
 

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.000
It is being underlined because
Avellaneda,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.973
in 1614, there had appeared an
apocryphal Quixote:

00:33:11.973 --> 00:33:16.948
"Segundo tomo del
ingensio hidalgo Don Quixote de

00:33:16.948 --> 00:33:21.744
la Mancha que contiene la
tercera salida [the third

00:33:21.744 --> 00:33:26.932
sally,
it will be the third sally]

00:33:26.932 --> 00:33:32.910
y es la quinta [the
fifth part,

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.121
because, remember,
the first part is divided in

00:33:36.121 --> 00:33:38.365
four,
so this is the fifth part,

00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:41.176
and so forth,
by: "Alonso

00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:46.204
Fernández de Avellaneda,
natural de la villa de

00:33:46.204 --> 00:33:50.544
Tordesillas [born in the
village of Tordesillas.]

00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:55.549
Tordesillas is a very famous
little town near Valladolid.

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:57.279
Why?
 

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.559
Does anyone remember why?
 

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.160
No one remembers why.
 

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.618
Student:
The treaties of Tordesillas

00:34:01.618 --> 00:34:03.558
Prof: The Treaties of
Tordesillas,

00:34:03.558 --> 00:34:06.470
you're all very learned Yalies,
the Treaties of Tordesillas,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:11.378
whereby the Pope in 1494
divided up the New World between

00:34:11.378 --> 00:34:13.219
Portugal and Spain.
 

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:17.503
Francois I, Francis the First
of France later complained in

00:34:17.503 --> 00:34:21.275
the sixteenth century,
he says he wanted to see Adam's

00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:23.469
will,
where Adam had bequeathed all

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:25.289
of this world to the Spanish.
 

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:28.289
So Tordesillas,
so you remember Tordesillas.

00:34:28.289 --> 00:34:33.891
Now, so he is a
caballero,

00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:38.969
not only an hidalgo.
 

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:43.481
Is it because Cervantes felt
that his "deeds,"

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:47.090
quote/unquote,
in the first part elevated him

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.239
to knight?
 

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:54.320
Some believe that the change
was made at the printers,

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.960
and not by Cervantes.
 

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.813
In part, to distinguish this
book from Avellaneda's which

00:35:01.813 --> 00:35:05.592
still called it hidalgo,
so you call it

00:35:05.592 --> 00:35:07.199
caballero,
knight,

00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:10.840
to distinguish it from the
apocryphal.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.039
Also, some have said that the
printers felt--

00:35:14.039 --> 00:35:15.980
you see the Quixote,
as you have learned,

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.480
was immediately translated into
several languages,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.211
English, French and so forth,
and the printers felt that

00:35:23.211 --> 00:35:26.179
caballero,
knight, was easier to translate

00:35:26.179 --> 00:35:28.360
into other languages than
hidalgo.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:34.775
Editors tend to make such
changes in the interest of

00:35:34.775 --> 00:35:38.112
profits,
but we don't know exactly,

00:35:38.112 --> 00:35:41.869
but the fact is that the title
has been changed,

00:35:41.869 --> 00:35:45.875
and this is a good way of
remembering that this is a

00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:47.210
different book.
 

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:54.641
Now, the second part was
finished in a hurry by Cervantes

00:35:54.641 --> 00:36:01.541
due, in large measure,
to the publication of the 1614

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:06.320
Avellaneda spurious second part.
 

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.715
Second parts had appeared of
Lazarillo,

00:36:10.715 --> 00:36:15.699
of Guzmán,
of La Celestina,

00:36:15.699 --> 00:36:19.045
not to mention those of
romances of chivalry as we saw

00:36:19.045 --> 00:36:21.949
in the episode of the scrutiny
of the books;

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:24.623
there were whole cycles,
second, third,

00:36:24.623 --> 00:36:25.679
fourth parts.
 

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:28.289
Why?
 

00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:33.943
William Henricks has recently
finished a doctoral dissertation

00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:37.929
about sequels,
and demonstrated that sequels

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:42.099
dominated the sixteenth century
in Spain;

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:48.206
were among the most popular of
books and that the whole poetics

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.570
of the sequel emerged.
 

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.815
It's not the same thing to
write a book from scratch than

00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:57.409
to write a book that is the
continuation of a previous book.

00:36:57.409 --> 00:37:03.579
Why did this happen?
 

00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:09.226
Well, it happened because with
the advent of printing it was

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:14.873
easier to produce these books
and to disseminate them and to

00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:21.139
make a profit from them,
so second parts proliferated.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:25.210
So in writing a second part of
the Quixote,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:30.159
Cervantes is following this
trend most recently,

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:31.876
the second part of the
Guzmán de

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:34.590
Alfarache,
which had been published right

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.590
before the first part of the
Quixote.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:46.797
Now, why was he so upset at the
appearance of the Avellaneda

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:49.449
Quixote?
 

00:37:49.449 --> 00:37:54.731
Because these novels and these
characters were becoming

00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:59.230
commodities over which people
would quarrel.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.030
Remember that we're talking
about authors,

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.768
as I have mentioned in earlier
classes,

00:38:03.768 --> 00:38:05.599
who are the first professional
authors,

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:09.909
who are trying to make a living
from their writing,

00:38:09.909 --> 00:38:13.722
so the Quixote was a
commodity for Cervantes

00:38:13.722 --> 00:38:18.068
particularly because this was
not a character derived from

00:38:18.068 --> 00:38:22.110
classical mythology to which
anyone had a right,

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:27.054
or from one of those cycles of
chivalric romances which had

00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:30.586
been used and reused,
this is a character that he

00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:32.570
invented so he felt it was his
own.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:37.103
Of course, the character would
become a literary myth and then

00:38:37.103 --> 00:38:41.626
taken up by others,
but at this juncture Cervantes

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:45.670
was very jealously guarding his
creation.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.003
He is very much aware of the
value of his invention because

00:38:51.003 --> 00:38:55.693
it brought him fame,
and also because it brought him

00:38:55.693 --> 00:38:56.889
a profit.
 

00:38:56.889 --> 00:39:01.525
In fact, you will get to an
episode in Part II that is a

00:39:01.525 --> 00:39:05.990
brilliant satire of the
relationship between money and

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.664
literary creation,
something that we take for

00:39:09.664 --> 00:39:12.318
granted now,
and it is the episode when Don

00:39:12.318 --> 00:39:15.701
Quixote smashes a puppet show
that was brought by none other

00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:19.139
than Ginés de Pasamonte
disguised as Maese Pedro,

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:22.018
and he breaks up all of the
figurines,

00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:26.320
and after the episode Don
Quixote has to pay for each one

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.590
of those figurines,
each one of those characters

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.920
depending on the importance of
the character in the story.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.268
So you can see that it is a
satire of the value of literary

00:39:37.268 --> 00:39:38.170
invention.
 

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:43.869
It is as if Ian Fleming said my
James Bond is worth so much and

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:47.594
Pussy Galore,
this woman who appears in one

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:51.210
of his movies,
outrageously named Pussy

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:56.179
Galore, is worth so much,
and so forth and so on.

00:39:56.179 --> 00:40:06.018
So the second part was written
in a hurry,

00:40:06.018 --> 00:40:11.405
and let me show in how much of
a hurry in detail by quoting one

00:40:11.405 --> 00:40:14.914
Henry Sullivan,
who in a book called

00:40:14.914 --> 00:40:19.780
Grotesque Purgatory
writes the following,

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.409
and I'm quoting--and follow
this closely.

00:40:23.409 --> 00:40:26.967
He says:
"Part II of the

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:32.230
Quixote was begun in 1612
[seven years after],

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:40.980
on the stocks and well on its
way by July 1613,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.190
about half complete by
twentieth of July 1614,

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:51.849
then continued at breakneck
speed in fall 1614,

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:58.018
and finally completed by
January or February 1615,

00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:01.856
a period of about
two-and-a-half years in

00:41:01.856 --> 00:41:03.869
all." Unquote.
 

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:07.802
I will return to this by using
a quote from Manual

00:41:07.802 --> 00:41:10.853
Durán,
but you can see--how does

00:41:10.853 --> 00:41:12.699
Sullivan know this?
 

00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:15.971
From evidence and documents and
statements by Cervantes and

00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:19.130
others and so forth about how
the novel was developed;

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.690
you will see that Part II is
quite long.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:33.306
Now, one of the best critics of
Avellaneda's Quixote was

00:41:33.306 --> 00:41:37.579
Stephen Gilman,
who was for many years a

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:41.846
professor at Harvard,
and he wrote an essay called

00:41:41.846 --> 00:41:48.119
The Apocryphal Quixote,
very much worth reading,

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:52.170
in which he has a memorable
phrase.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.144
Gilman says that Cervantes,
rather than confront

00:41:56.144 --> 00:41:58.967
Avellaneda,
which he does to a certain

00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:01.739
extent, quote:
"prefers to encompass him

00:42:01.739 --> 00:42:03.440
in a web of irony."
 

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.114
This is Cervantes through a net
of irony, a web of irony over

00:42:09.114 --> 00:42:10.250
his rival.
 

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.864
You will see how he does that,
because actually Avellaneda's

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:16.945
greatest triumph--
his book didn't have much

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:20.730
success--was to wind up as a
character within Don

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:24.280
Quixote's fiction,
and having his characters

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.460
incorporated into Don
Quixote's fiction,

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.987
to add to the game of mirrors
that the Quixote already

00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:31.340
was.
 

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:39.637
In fact, a critic--and with
enough time in their hands

00:42:39.637 --> 00:42:47.309
critics and scholars will almost
say anything--

00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:53.541
a critic claimed in 1915 that
the apocryphal Quixote

00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:57.840
had been written by Cervantes
himself.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.195
That's absurd,
but at some level it makes

00:43:03.195 --> 00:43:06.514
sense,
because if Avellaneda hadn't

00:43:06.514 --> 00:43:08.641
existed,
Cervantes would have had to

00:43:08.641 --> 00:43:11.588
invent him in the way that he
uses him in Part II of the

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:12.349
Quixote.
 

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:19.652
Now, if you want to read the
most outlandish take on all of

00:43:19.652 --> 00:43:23.019
this,
you must read a story by the

00:43:23.019 --> 00:43:26.139
Argentine master Jorge Luis
Borges,

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:29.739
who wrote a story called
"Pierre Menard,

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:32.438
Author of the
Quixote"

00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:36.405
in which a French poet,
minor scholar and so forth

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:39.239
decides to write the
Quixote again,

00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:41.179
but not a different
Quixote,

00:43:41.179 --> 00:43:44.998
but the same Quixote
word-for-word as Cervantes had

00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:45.869
written it.
 

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:51.103
It is a dizzying theoretical
meditation on all of these games

00:43:51.103 --> 00:43:56.163
of authorship that Cervantes
initiates himself in Part I of

00:43:56.163 --> 00:44:00.349
the Quixote and continues
in Part II.

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:03.514
In a sense, the appearance of
Avellaneda is like a

00:44:03.514 --> 00:44:05.260
self-fulfilling prophecy.
 

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.880
If there was a Cide Hamete
Benengeli who was supposed to

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.239
have been the real author of
the Quixote--

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:13.800
and is, of course,
a fictional author--

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.713
suddenly Cervantes finds
himself with a real false author

00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:23.195
of the Quixote;
so this is what the Avellaneda

00:44:23.195 --> 00:44:25.809
book adds to the Quixote.
 

00:44:25.809 --> 00:44:33.630
Now, the Avellaneda book is
tremendously boring.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:37.489
It is conceived within
scholastic philosophy,

00:44:37.489 --> 00:44:42.554
the characters instead of
engaging dialogue have long

00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:46.449
monologues that are really
obnoxious,

00:44:46.449 --> 00:44:50.590
Don Quixote is not in love with
Dulcinea,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.989
he is the "unloving
knight,"

00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:58.518
Sancho is a bit pornographic,
it is, in fact,

00:44:58.518 --> 00:45:04.659
a very dull book that only
those of us who are cervantistas

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:08.260
and cannot avoid doing so read.
 

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:19.891
So much about Avellaneda,
and now let's move on to Part

00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:20.969
II.
 

00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:24.929
You have a treat in store
because, in my view,

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:28.610
Part II is better than Part I,
if that is possible,

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.780
although scholars argue back
and forth about this,

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:35.204
but I think there's no question
Part II is a superior book and

00:45:35.204 --> 00:45:39.740
is even much more complicated,
and complicated by the fact

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.389
that characters in Part II have
read Part I,

00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:49.001
adding to the game of mirrors,
and you will find this in the

00:45:49.001 --> 00:45:52.139
very early chapters of Part II.
 

00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:55.380
I'm going to read you now a few
quotes,

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:01.231
again, from Durán's
"Cervantes,"

00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:08.059
because they serve as a good
introduction to Part II,

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:12.271
because it is kind of a
synthesis of what Durán

00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:17.039
thinks or thought about the
Quixote at this point,

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:22.121
and you have some general ideas
before embarking on reading Part

00:46:22.121 --> 00:46:24.300
II of the Quixote.
 

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.523
These are quotes.
 

00:46:25.523 --> 00:46:29.409
He says: "The art of
dialogue in Cervantes reaches

00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:33.010
its peak in the second half of
his novel."

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.829
It is true, the second part
there is much more dialogue,

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:39.059
and not just between Sancho and
Don Quixote--

00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:41.530
those dialogues that we enjoy
so much and there are more

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.726
here--
but among many different

00:46:43.726 --> 00:46:47.018
characters with different points
of view,

00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:51.420
different ways of speaking and
so forth.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.070
Again, Durán:
"It is also in the second

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.639
part when the interaction of the
two main characters,

00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:00.963
the knight and his squire,
reaches a climax:

00:47:00.963 --> 00:47:04.983
Sancho Panza becomes
increasingly quixotized and even

00:47:04.983 --> 00:47:09.389
at certain moments occupies the
center of the stage,

00:47:09.389 --> 00:47:12.889
having become temporarily the
novel's central character.

00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:14.949
It is an impressive trick.
 

00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:18.463
It is not done with mirrors,
it is achieved through

00:47:18.463 --> 00:47:19.516
dialogue."
 

00:47:19.516 --> 00:47:20.289
Unquote.
 

00:47:20.289 --> 00:47:21.869
And this is true.
 

00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:25.110
You will see that Sancho,
in various chapters that I'm

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.800
not going to anticipate and ruin
for you,

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.429
becomes the protagonist of the
novel,

00:47:31.429 --> 00:47:35.670
and there is a back and forth
between Don Quixote and Sancho.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.840
Again, Durán:
"Human memory,

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.557
the memory of the squire and
his master, ruminates upon the

00:47:43.557 --> 00:47:44.289
past.
 

00:47:44.289 --> 00:47:50.090
Nothing that occurs in their
travels is entirely finished.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:54.105
They will talk about what has
happened to them and try to find

00:47:54.105 --> 00:47:57.989
a meaning to every obscure
detail etched in their memory.

00:47:57.989 --> 00:48:02.052
Every possibility the future
holds open will influence their

00:48:02.052 --> 00:48:05.344
present attitudes,
since the past keeps on echoing

00:48:05.344 --> 00:48:09.036
upon the present and the future
keeps on working its magic upon

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:13.579
the minds of the two characters,
each moment of the present is

00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:18.130
made richer and more subtle by
the interplay of past,

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:20.150
present and future."
 

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.150
Unquote.
 

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:28.250
To this I might add that the
presence of Part I,

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:35.268
as a memory,
is an important one in Part II,

00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:43.603
and a device of Part II is that
many episodes are in some way a

00:48:43.603 --> 00:48:50.282
rewriting of episodes of Part I,
a rewriting that is usually

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:53.059
much more complicated and
elaborate,

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:57.684
but you can see the kernel of
the episode from Part I in the

00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.329
episode in Part II.
 

00:48:59.329 --> 00:49:03.168
This raises,
of course, philosophical issues

00:49:03.168 --> 00:49:07.900
about memory and about the
repetition of the past,

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.771
and all of that,
that we will be talking about

00:49:10.771 --> 00:49:12.750
when we reach those episodes.
 

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.664
The interaction between the
individual and his environment

00:49:17.664 --> 00:49:21.788
is shown to be unique,
it escapes logic and language

00:49:21.788 --> 00:49:25.860
because logic and language are
systems of labels superimposed

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.342
upon our experience,
and Cervantes wants to free us

00:49:29.342 --> 00:49:33.106
from all labels by showing how
much each individual is capable

00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:36.750
of interpreting his own facet of
a multifaceted reality.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:43.280
The presence of reality in its
multifaceted ways,

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.190
and the way of interpreting
becomes much more complicated in

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.699
Part II,
because disguises proliferate

00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:56.739
and a lot more of the action
takes place not in the open air,

00:49:56.739 --> 00:50:02.603
but indoors,
where charades can be organized

00:50:02.603 --> 00:50:04.650
and so forth.
 

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:11.889
Now, the following quote which
is a little long,

00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:17.530
but takes us back to the
composition of Part II,

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.927
and I think will,
I hope, round out your

00:50:20.927 --> 00:50:24.849
knowledge of it as you approach
reading it.

00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:27.327
Durán goes:
"The sense of unreality is

00:50:27.327 --> 00:50:30.414
heightened throughout Part II
when Don Quixote and Sancho have

00:50:30.414 --> 00:50:34.159
to face their doubles,
their reflection in the mirror.

00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:38.130
They meet people who have read
Part I or have heard about it,

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:41.902
they have to react to what
these readers of their previous

00:50:41.902 --> 00:50:44.018
adventures think about them.
 

00:50:44.018 --> 00:50:49.434
Even worse, after chapter XXXVI
[which is when Cervantes finds

00:50:49.434 --> 00:50:53.340
out about the existence of
Avellaneda's book]

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.362
after chapters XXXVI,
they have to fight off another

00:50:57.362 --> 00:51:00.436
image of themselves,
the bogus image in the crooked

00:51:00.436 --> 00:51:02.980
mirror of Avellaneda's fake
second part,

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.010
the false Quixote.
 

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:09.192
Towards the end of 1614
Cervantes was working [this is

00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:12.909
what we went over,
but now I'm going to repeat in

00:51:12.909 --> 00:51:16.070
a different key]
on chapter XXXVI of his second

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.619
part.
 

00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:20.268
Avellaneda's book appeared in
October of the same year.

00:51:20.268 --> 00:51:24.764
Cervantes reacted by writing
thirty-eight chapters in seven

00:51:24.764 --> 00:51:29.726
months, a strenuous effort which
may have exhausted what was left

00:51:29.726 --> 00:51:31.820
of a precarious health.
 

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.061
The spurious second part was
the work of an unknown author

00:51:36.061 --> 00:51:39.039
[Avellaneda is obviously a
pseudonym,

00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:41.663
it's a pen name,
we don't know who really

00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:44.675
Avellaneda was],
but Cervantes's hard won

00:51:44.675 --> 00:51:49.014
reputation was in danger until
he could refute the piracy by

00:51:49.014 --> 00:51:51.000
issuing his own Part II.
 

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.443
He was also indignant at the
lack of intelligence and

00:51:54.443 --> 00:51:56.429
sensitivity of his imitator.
 

00:51:56.429 --> 00:52:00.905
[He was even a bad imitator,
if he had been a good imitator

00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:05.380
he may have been flattered.]
His anger is expressed through

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.773
his main characters,
Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:52:08.773 --> 00:52:10.809
have to face their ugly ghosts.
 

00:52:10.809 --> 00:52:15.342
They must convince the readers
of Avellaneda's book that they

00:52:15.342 --> 00:52:19.572
are real and Avellaneda's
characters are intruders trying

00:52:19.572 --> 00:52:22.762
to usurp their personality,
their selves,

00:52:22.762 --> 00:52:24.905
their reality,
it is a situation only

00:52:24.905 --> 00:52:28.000
Cervantes or Pirandello could
have devised."

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.840
The allusion here is to Luigi
Pirandello,

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.673
a great Italian playwright of
the twentieth century who wrote

00:52:34.673 --> 00:52:38.061
a famous play called Six
Characters in Search of an

00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:42.601
Author;
so Cervantes' characters are

00:52:42.601 --> 00:52:50.150
disputing other characters,
their reality or fictionality.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.849
In a way, having read Part I
yourselves,

00:52:53.849 --> 00:52:58.052
you are like some of the
characters in Part II of the

00:52:58.052 --> 00:53:01.585
Quixote,
and you are in a very similar

00:53:01.585 --> 00:53:05.369
situation as you go through that
second part.

00:53:05.369 --> 00:53:07.139
Okay.
 

00:53:07.139 --> 00:53:07.889
Leave it there.
 

00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:13.000

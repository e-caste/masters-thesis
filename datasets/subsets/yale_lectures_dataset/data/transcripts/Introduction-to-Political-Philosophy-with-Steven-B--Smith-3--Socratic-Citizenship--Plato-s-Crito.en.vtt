00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.998
Professor Steven Smith:
Okay I want to begin with a

00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:04.510
question today,
I have a question for you;

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.842
well you've been reading the
Apology,

00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.987
you've now read the--you've
read the Apology and the

00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:12.864
Crito;
you've had a little chance to

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:17.205
think about these works.
I'd just like to do a piece of

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.037
survey research,
how many of you,

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:23.400
just a show of hands is all I
need;

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.446
how many of you believe
Socrates is innocent and should

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:28.570
be acquitted?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.830
Okay and how many of you
believe he is guilty and more or

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.070
less got what he deserved?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.449
Higher please, okay.
Not exactly the same

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.272
proportion, I think,
somewhat a greater number

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:04.709
believe in his innocence than in
the Athenian jury obviously.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.691
But let me just ask you in the
brown shirt, just curious,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:14.849
why do you think he is innocent
and should be acquitted?

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.563
Student: Well I felt
that he [inaudible]

00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:27.254
and it seemed to me that the
[inaudible]

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:32.070
more on personal views
[inaudible]

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.200
and not exactly by concrete
charges.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.642
Professor Steven Smith:
And I noticed you had your,

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:47.629
yes why do you believe he was
guilty and got what he deserved?

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:54.046
Student: [Inaudible]
what is just isn't somehow

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.767
[inaudible]
what is just is what society

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:04.699
agrees [inaudible]
and I mean he was going against

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:12.326
people who had the authority to
define words like in [inaudible]

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:19.226
what is just is what society
says is just and society says

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:23.943
[inaudible].
Professor Steven Smith:

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.777
Okay so as Lincoln once said,
both of you can't be right,

00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:32.090
neither of you may be right,
but both of you can't be right.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.562
So this is a question that I
want to continue today,

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:41.562
to consider what the trial of
Socrates means and I want to

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:46.911
begin by going back to a problem
or a paradox that I ended the

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:51.625
class with last time.
That is to say that Socrates

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:55.478
proposes, right,
a new conception of what it is

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:59.119
to be a citizen,
he opposes, we have seen,

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.152
the traditional,
you might say Homeric

00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:05.081
conception,
of the citizen,

00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:10.903
certain notions of citizen
loyalty and patriotism,

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:14.433
created,
shaped by the poetic tradition

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:18.467
going back to Homer.
He wants to replace that with a

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:22.542
new kind of, I want to call it
rational citizenship,

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:27.605
philosophical citizenship.
A view of citizenship that,

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:33.503
again, relies on one's own
powers of independent reason and

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:39.808
judgment and argument and in the
course of defending this point

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:42.583
of view,
Socrates says,

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:48.189
in an interesting passage,
that he has spent his entire

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:54.417
life pursuing private matters
rather than public ones and has

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:58.569
deliberately avoided public
issues,

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.889
issues of politics and that
raises a question.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.600
How can a citizen,
how can this new kind of

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.860
citizenship that he is
proposing,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.717
how can any kind of citizenship
be devoted just to private

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:15.337
matters and not public?
Citizenship seems to require

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:19.730
even the public sphere,
the public realm.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.105
What does Socrates mean when he
says his way of life has been

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:28.334
devoted almost exclusively to
private rather than to public

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:31.389
matters?
Well, the first thing we might

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.512
think about is whether that's
entirely true,

00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:38.579
whether he's being entirely
candid with his audience;

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.457
after all, the kind of
investigations,

00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:46.356
the kind of interrogations that
he has been pursuing since going

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:50.400
to the Delphic Oracle and then
following at least his

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.011
interpretation of its mandate,
these investigations of the

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:58.500
politicians, the poets,
the craftsman and the like.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.769
He says these have been carried
out in public,

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.692
he has gone around in the
market and in the open and in

00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:10.571
the public forum questioning,
interrogating and obviously

00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:14.339
making a variety of people look
foolish.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.380
So this is hardly simply a
private question or a private

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.605
way of life but perhaps he means
simply that by pursuing a

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:30.104
private life that again he's
going to rely almost exclusively

00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:35.420
on his own individual powers of
reason and judgment,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.928
not to defer or rely on such
public goods as custom,

00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:44.060
as authority,
as tradition,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.981
things of this sort.
But I think Socrates means more

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.508
than that, more than simply he
wishes to rely on the powers of

00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:57.405
private individual judgment.
When he says that his way of

00:05:57.405 --> 00:06:02.225
life has been private,
he means that he has pursued a

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:06.271
policy of,
let's call it "the principled

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:12.172
abstinence from public life."
Socrates is a great abstainer,

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:17.308
he has abstained from
participation in the collective

00:06:17.308 --> 00:06:23.133
actions of the city,
actions that he believes could

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:29.529
only entail a complicity in acts
of public injustice.

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.489
His own motto,
if you want to ascribe him a

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:36.153
motto, seems to be a variety of
the Hippocratic Oath,

00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:40.100
you know, that doctors are
famous for: "do no harm."

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.636
And to do no harm he has
required of himself a kind of

00:06:45.636 --> 00:06:49.920
principled abstention from
public life.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.601
If George Bush described
himself not long ago as the

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:59.100
decider, you might call Socrates
the abstainer.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.982
But what does he mean by or
what do I mean by referring to

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:08.180
his policies of abstention from
political life?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:16.279
Do you remember he gives a
couple of examples of this sort?

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.513
One of them,
remember, concerned his refusal

00:07:20.513 --> 00:07:25.732
to join in the judgment to
condemn and execute the ten

00:07:25.732 --> 00:07:31.639
Athenian generals who had failed
to collect the corpses,

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.425
the bodies, of the men lost in
a particular battle during the

00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:41.074
Peloponnesian War?
This was a mark of great shame

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:44.680
and disgrace.
This was an actual event.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.404
There was a kind of judgment of
collective guilt and they were

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:54.901
all executed there,
the leaders,

00:07:54.901 --> 00:08:01.102
the generals of this particular
battle and Socrates tells how he

00:08:01.102 --> 00:08:06.812
refused to engage in that kind
of--to join the court in the

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:10.750
judgment of their collective
guilt,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.900
a true incident.
And the second story you

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.550
remember from your reading of
the book was his telling,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.990
reminding the jury how he
refused to participate.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.487
He was ordered by the Thirty,
the hated Tyranny of the

00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:36.832
Thirty, he was ordered to assist
in the arrest of a man known as

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:41.516
Leon of Salamis,
an arrest that would have and

00:08:41.516 --> 00:08:47.490
did in fact lead to Leon's
execution and Socrates tells how

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:53.257
he at considerable risk to
himself refused to participate

00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:58.992
in the arrest of this man.
In both of these cases,

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:05.404
I take it, Socrates' point is
that his own individual moral

00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:10.379
integrity stands as a kind of
litmus test,

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:14.028
you might say,
for whether to engage or

00:09:14.028 --> 00:09:18.886
disengage from political life.
"I was the sort of man," he

00:09:18.886 --> 00:09:21.600
tells the jury,
"I was the sort of man who

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.041
never conceded anything to
anyone contrary to what is

00:09:25.041 --> 00:09:29.393
just,"
no doubt also reminding them of

00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:36.173
his, again, his refusal to bow
to the Thirty Tyrants in the

00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:40.579
case of Leon of Salamis.
But this raises,

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:44.720
I think, the central or a
central point about Socratic

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.470
citizenship or Socrates' view of
citizenship,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.953
this kind of principled
disobedience to the law,

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:58.200
something like Thoreau's model
of civil disobedience.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.200
Does this policy of principled
disobedience,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.595
you might say vindicate or
indict Socrates of the charge of

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:13.269
corruption and impiety that has
been brought against him?

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:17.663
Can a citizen he affirms,
I will ask though,

00:10:17.663 --> 00:10:22.975
can a citizen put his own
conscience above the law as

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:27.803
Socrates seems to do?
This is a problem that we will

00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:32.425
see considerably later in the
term that vexes a very important

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:36.592
political thinker by the name of
Hobbes about whether an

00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:41.442
individual can somehow put their
own sense of conscience or moral

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:46.237
integrity even above the law.
What would a community of

00:10:46.237 --> 00:10:51.200
Socratic citizens look like,
each one picking and choosing,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.746
you might say,
the laws or the rules to obey

00:10:55.746 --> 00:11:01.072
or to follow or not to follow.
Socrates is so concerned,

00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:05.502
it seems, with his individual,
his private moral integrity

00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:09.309
that he says in a sense to the
city of Athens,

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:11.086
to the court,
to the Athens,

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:15.100
to the Assembly or the courts
that he will not dirty his hands

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.114
with public life and again this
is a question that we will see

00:11:19.114 --> 00:11:23.194
later on that Machiavelli takes
very seriously--the question of

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:28.014
whether or not politics,
political life requires one to

00:11:28.014 --> 00:11:33.047
dirty one's hands in the world.
What kind of citizen is it,

00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:37.006
is he or she who abstains from,
maybe even rejects,

00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:41.519
the harsh necessities,
requirements of political life?

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:45.804
Socrates seems to be in some
respects an example of what

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:50.789
Hegel in the nineteenth century
described as a beautiful soul,

00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:56.092
you know, someone who and he
used that term ironically I

00:11:56.092 --> 00:12:01.008
should say, someone who puts
their own private moral

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:07.082
incorruptibility above all else
and we all probably know or have

00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:12.981
read about people like this.
How does Socrates answer these

00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:18.138
charges of, in a way being not
just an abstainer but he kept

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:23.469
putting his own private moral
conscience or integrity over and

00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:27.794
above the law?
He tries to defend his point of

00:12:27.794 --> 00:12:32.350
view by arguing in a famous
passage that his policy of

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.679
abstinence actually carries
important benefits to the city.

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:40.546
He brings with it important
benefits and in the passage that

00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:43.560
I'm referring to,
he defines himself as a gadfly,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.269
everyone will remember that,
the gadfly who improves the

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:50.565
quality of life in the city.
In section 30d,

00:12:50.565 --> 00:12:53.940
Socrates writes,
let me read the passage.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.172
"So I, men of Athens are now
too far from making a defense

00:12:58.172 --> 00:13:01.810
speech on my own behalf,
I do it rather," he says,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.098
" on your behalf.
What I say, I say for you," he

00:13:05.098 --> 00:13:07.231
appears to say,
"so that you do not do

00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:10.169
something wrong concerning the
gift of the god,"

00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:13.975
referring to himself,
"the gift of the god by voting

00:13:13.975 --> 00:13:16.997
to condemn me.
For if you kill me," he

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:21.924
continues, "you will not easily
discover another of my sort who

00:13:21.924 --> 00:13:25.500
even if it is rather ridiculous
to say so,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.737
has simply been set upon the
city by the god as though upon a

00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:34.115
great and well-born horse who is
rather sluggish because of his

00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:38.000
great size and needs to be
awakened by some gadfly.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.057
Just so in fact the god seems
to me to have set me upon the

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:47.988
city as someone of this sort.
I awaken and persuade and

00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:52.892
reproach each one of you and I
do not stop settling down

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:56.279
everywhere upon you the whole
day."

00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:00.398
So here we have the example of
Socrates telling us not only

00:14:00.398 --> 00:14:04.942
declaring himself to be the gift
of the god who is brought but he

00:14:04.942 --> 00:14:07.639
is a great benefactor of the
city,

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:14.475
that his example of the man,
of individual moral conscience,

00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:20.210
brings with it great,
as it were, public benefits.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.898
It is not on his behalf,
he tells the audience,

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:28.710
but yours, his fellow citizens'
that he does what he does.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.614
"You may not like me," he says
to the jury, "but I am good for

00:14:33.614 --> 00:14:38.679
you and furthermore he claims in
this what can only be described

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:43.182
as sort of quasi-religious
language that he has no choice

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:46.850
in the matter.
This is not something he has

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.882
chosen to do.
He is, as he says a gift from

00:14:49.882 --> 00:14:53.679
the god, he has been commanded,
he argues, to do this.

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:57.119
"Men of Athens," he says,
"I will obey the god rather

00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:00.889
than you and as long as I
breathe and am able to do so,

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:04.120
I will certainly not stop
philosophizing."

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.984
He seems to envelope himself
and his way of life with a kind

00:15:09.984 --> 00:15:13.768
of religious imagery,
the Delphic Oracle,

00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:18.184
the gift of the god image,
he envelopes his conception of

00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:22.522
citizenship within this
religious language and this will

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:27.569
or should lead any reader of the
Apology and any reader of

00:15:27.569 --> 00:15:31.986
Plato to ask an important
question about Socrates' use of

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:34.771
this language.
We will see it again in

00:15:34.771 --> 00:15:36.419
different ways in the
Republic.

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:41.767
Is he sincere in saying this,
in making this point or his he

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:47.295
somehow being ironical in his
use of the religious tone or the

00:15:47.295 --> 00:15:50.732
religious register?
He is, after all,

00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:54.710
on trial for his life,
for the charge of impiety.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:00.193
Would it not seem that in order
to rebut the charge of impiety

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:05.496
that he would use or adopt a
kind of religious language that

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:10.710
would resonate with the jury and
rebut the accusation,

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:15.308
perhaps even suggesting that he
is the truly religious and pious

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:19.688
one and not the ones like Anytus
and Meletus who are bringing

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:22.586
charges against him?
Socrates seems,

00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:25.645
or could be seen,
to be speaking not just

00:16:25.645 --> 00:16:30.385
ironically but provocatively in
describing himself as a gift of

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:33.873
the god.
In a sense, you might ask what

00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:38.279
could be more ludicrous,
Socrates declaring himself or

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:43.100
anyone declaring themselves to
be a gift of the divine.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:51.820
But, right, who would make such
a claim?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.277
But in another respect he seems
to take the divine calling very

00:16:57.277 --> 00:17:00.710
seriously, right,
I mean does he not?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.225
It was only when the Delphic
Oracle replied to Charephon,

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:08.958
he tells that story,
that no one was wiser than

00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:13.101
Socrates, that Socrates
undertook this second sailing as

00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:16.063
it were,
his turn away from the

00:17:16.063 --> 00:17:21.881
investigation of purely natural
phenomena to the study of the

00:17:21.881 --> 00:17:25.470
world of moral virtue and
justice.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:30.633
He repeatedly maintains that
the path he has taken is not of

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:35.359
his own choosing but the result
of a divine command.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:40.019
He is under some kind of divine
edict and it is precisely

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:42.829
his devotion to this divine
command,

00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:47.319
to this particular kind of
calling that has led him to

00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:52.612
neglect his worldly affairs.
He reminds, at various points,

00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:57.565
the audience of his extreme
poverty, his neglect of his

00:17:57.565 --> 00:18:03.161
family and his obligations to
his wife and children as well as

00:18:03.161 --> 00:18:08.665
to suffer the disgrace and the
abuse that is directed against

00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:13.130
him by various public figures,
he tells us.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.956
All of this is the result of
his devotion to the divine

00:18:17.956 --> 00:18:20.320
command.
He presents himself,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.819
in other words,
as a human being of

00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:27.450
unparalleled piety and devotion
who will risk life itself rather

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.200
than quit the post that has been
given to him.

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:38.339
It's a very tall order that he
claims for himself.

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:41.502
Do we believe him in this
respect, I mean an important

00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:43.650
question, do we believe him
again,

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:50.150
is he being sincere in this or
is he using this as it were a

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:55.660
kind of rhetoric with which to
envelope himself?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.546
What is this peculiar kind of
piety that he claims to

00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:02.856
practice?
In many ways,

00:19:02.856 --> 00:19:08.255
in replying to the jury's
verdict in the request that he

00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:13.065
cease philosophizing,
Socrates explains himself in

00:19:13.065 --> 00:19:18.165
the following terms.
Let me just quote one other

00:19:18.165 --> 00:19:24.338
passage briefly from the second
speech that he gives to the jury

00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:28.836
after his conviction.
"It is hardest of all to

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:32.592
persuade you,
to persuade some of you about

00:19:32.592 --> 00:19:36.259
this," he says,
about his way of life.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:40.596
"For if I say that this is to
disobey the god and because of

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.390
this it is impossible to keep
quiet,

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:48.365
you will not be persuaded by me
on the grounds that I am being

00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:50.506
ironic.
And on the other hand," he

00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:53.805
says, "if I say that this even
happens to be a very great good

00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:56.887
for a human being that is to
make speeches every day about

00:19:56.887 --> 00:20:00.132
virtue and that the unexamined
life is not worth living for a

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:03.756
human being,
you will still less be

00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:07.256
persuaded by me."
In other words,

00:20:07.256 --> 00:20:12.853
what he seems to be saying in
that passage at around 37c and d

00:20:12.853 --> 00:20:17.900
is that he realizes he is on the
horns of a dilemma.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.934
On the one hand,
he says, his reference to a

00:20:20.934 --> 00:20:23.970
divine mission,
he explicitly says there,

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:29.770
will be taken by his audience
as being just another instance

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.309
of Socratic irony and
insincerity.

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:36.750
But, he says,
if he tries to persuade people

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.470
of the goodness and the justice
of his way of life on simply

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.837
rational grounds alone,
to persuade them that the

00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:50.960
examined life alone is worth
living, he says he will not be

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.252
believed.
So, what you might say is a

00:20:54.252 --> 00:20:58.468
Socratic citizen to do,
he will either be accused of

00:20:58.468 --> 00:21:03.759
being ironic and not be believed
or he will simply be disbelieved

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:08.719
if he attempts to defend himself
on rational or philosophical

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:12.166
grounds.
That raises the question,

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:16.049
I think, that I began the class
with today.

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:21.698
Should Socrates be tolerated,
would a good society tolerate

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.804
Socrates?
This is the question raised by

00:21:24.804 --> 00:21:27.720
this dialogue in the
Crito as well.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:33.182
How far should freedom of
speech and that is to say speech

00:21:33.182 --> 00:21:36.345
that borders on,
even verges into,

00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:40.466
civic impiety,
how far should such speech be

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:44.297
tolerated?
It's been an assumption of

00:21:44.297 --> 00:21:49.599
readers of Plato over the years
that the trial of Socrates,

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:55.265
that the execution of Socrates,
presents the case for the

00:21:55.265 --> 00:22:01.032
fullest liberty or freedom of
thought in discussion in the

00:22:01.032 --> 00:22:06.597
evils or the dangers to a
society of trying to persecute

00:22:06.597 --> 00:22:11.680
or suppress freedom of speech.
But is this right,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.640
in other words,
is that really Plato's

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.956
teaching?
Among the things Socrates says

00:22:17.956 --> 00:22:22.119
he cares deeply about is his
calling, as he puts it,

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:26.574
to do nothing but persuade you
both younger and older not to

00:22:26.574 --> 00:22:31.255
care for your bodies and money
but how your soul will be in the

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.370
best possible condition.

00:22:54.039 --> 00:23:01.505
How are we to understand this
case about toleration and

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:06.460
freedom of speech?
The Apology presents

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.491
Socrates right as presenting the
most intransigent case for the

00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:16.359
philosopher as a radical critic
or questioner of society.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:22.094
Socrates demands that the
Athenians change not simply this

00:23:22.094 --> 00:23:28.331
or that aspect of their policy
but he demands nothing less than

00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:32.415
a drastic,
I would even say revolutionary,

00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:37.420
change in Athenian civic life,
in Athenian civic culture.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.513
He tells his fellows citizens,
right, that their lives are not

00:23:41.513 --> 00:23:45.379
worth living,
only the examined life is worth

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:50.729
living and you are not living
examined lives therefore your

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:54.880
life cannot possibly have any
value to it.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.251
Even when presented with the
option to cease philosophizing,

00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:02.289
he refuses to do so on the
ground that,

00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:05.842
again, he is acting under a
command, divine command and

00:24:05.842 --> 00:24:09.792
cannot do otherwise.
Is Plato asking us to regard

00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:14.797
Socrates as a man of high
principle, standing up for what

00:24:14.797 --> 00:24:20.250
he believes in the face of death
or as a kind of revolutionary

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:25.523
agitator who cannot and should
not be tolerated by a society

00:24:25.523 --> 00:24:30.349
whose basic laws and values he
will not accept?

00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:35.304
To some degree,
I am inclined to answer that

00:24:35.304 --> 00:24:40.950
both of those questions have
something to them.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.812
Maybe the answer,
or an answer,

00:24:42.812 --> 00:24:45.980
to this question is revealed in
the Crito,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:52.059
the companion dialogue,
the companion speech that goes

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:58.275
along with the Apology,
although it typically gets much

00:24:58.275 --> 00:25:01.559
less attention than the
Apology.

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:05.240
In part, because I think the
dialogue presents,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.655
as it were, the city's case,
the case of the city against

00:25:09.655 --> 00:25:13.400
Socrates, I mean to consider
some of the following.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.692
If the Apology presents
the philosopher's case against

00:25:17.692 --> 00:25:20.839
the city, Socrates' case against
the city,

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:24.803
the Crito presents the
city's case against the

00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:28.539
philosopher.
Here, Socrates makes the case

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:32.866
against himself,
you might say he makes the case

00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:38.849
against himself better than his
accusers in the courtroom did.

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:43.439
So in the Apology,
the speech between Socrates and

00:25:43.439 --> 00:25:47.626
the laws that form,
as it were the kind of central

00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:51.984
action of the dialogue,
presents the case that Meletus

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:55.519
and Anytus should have made
against him.

00:25:55.519 --> 00:26:00.056
While the Apology seems
to denigrate the political life

00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:04.220
as requiring complicity in
injustice and Socrates says he

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.980
will have no part of laws or
policies that entail injustice,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.456
the Crito makes the case
for the dignity of the laws,

00:26:13.456 --> 00:26:17.250
the dignity or majesty of the
city and its laws.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.661
While the Apology
defends, again,

00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:25.298
a politics of principled
abstinence or disobedience to

00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:30.072
the political life,
the Crito makes the most

00:26:30.072 --> 00:26:35.508
complete and far-reaching case
for obligation and obedience to

00:26:35.508 --> 00:26:39.339
the law that has perhaps ever
been made.

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:43.934
So how do we reconcile,
if we can, these two apparently

00:26:43.934 --> 00:26:48.530
contradictory points of view in
these two dialogues?

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:56.984
These two dialogues,
it should be evident,

00:26:56.984 --> 00:27:02.316
I mean, differ not only in
content but in their dramatic

00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:03.480
context.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.630
Just consider,
again, some of the following.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:15.505
The Apology is a speech
given before a large and largely

00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:20.433
anonymous audience of over 500
persons, the Assembly,

00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:24.494
the Court.
We see Socrates addressing,

00:27:24.494 --> 00:27:30.369
the only time in any platonic
dialogue, an audience of this

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:32.469
size.
The Crito,

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:35.730
on the other hand,
is a conversation between

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.750
Socrates and a single
individual, only one person.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.456
The Apology takes place
in the Court of Athens,

00:27:44.456 --> 00:27:50.446
the most public of settings,
while the Crito occurs

00:27:50.446 --> 00:27:56.640
within the darkness and
confinement of a prison cell.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.378
The Apology shows
Socrates defending himself and

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:04.325
his life as a gift of the god
that most truly benefits the

00:28:04.325 --> 00:28:08.876
city but in the Crito,
we see him bow down to the

00:28:08.876 --> 00:28:13.498
authority of the laws that he
seems to have previously

00:28:13.498 --> 00:28:18.642
rejected and finally if the
Apology presents Socrates

00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:22.130
as the first martyr for
philosophy,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.730
the first person to die for the
cause of philosophy,

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.471
the Crito shows
Socrates' trial and sentence as

00:28:29.471 --> 00:28:31.730
a case of justice delivered.

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:38.408
These huge contrasts,
again, they force us to ask a

00:28:38.408 --> 00:28:42.498
question, what is Plato doing in
presenting these two very

00:28:42.498 --> 00:28:47.512
different points of view,
what is his point in presenting

00:28:47.512 --> 00:28:53.282
these two works with two such
sharply contrasting perspectives

00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:57.350
on the relation of Socrates to
the city?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.328
Was Plato confused,
was he contradicting himself,

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:08.900
was he--what was he doing?

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:14.230
Big question.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.280
I hope I have time to answer it.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.069
So let's look into the
Crito just a little bit.

00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:35.229
Crito is named for a
friend and disciple of Socrates

00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:39.499
who at the outset of the
dialogue is sitting as a

00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:42.880
watchful guardian over his
mentor.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.930
He urges Socrates to allow him
to help him escape.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:53.022
The jailers have been bribed
and escape would be made easy

00:29:53.022 --> 00:29:57.400
but rather than trying to
convince Crito directly,

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.008
Socrates creates a dialogue;
actually, you might say a

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:05.785
dialogue within the larger
dialogue, a dialogue between

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:09.981
himself and the laws of Athens
where he puts forward the case

00:30:09.981 --> 00:30:14.414
against escape,
that is to say the case against

00:30:14.414 --> 00:30:20.483
disobedience to the law and the
argument could be summarized as

00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:24.829
follows.
No state can exist without

00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:28.023
rules.
The first rule of any state is

00:30:28.023 --> 00:30:32.496
the rule that citizens are not
free to set aside the rules,

00:30:32.496 --> 00:30:36.970
to choose among them which ones
to obey and to disobey.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.168
To engage in civil disobedience
of any kind is not only to call

00:30:42.168 --> 00:30:47.366
this or that rule into question
but it is to call into question

00:30:47.366 --> 00:30:51.750
the very nature of law,
the very question of the rules.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.905
To question or disobey the law
is tantamount to destroying the

00:30:56.905 --> 00:31:01.523
authority of the law.
The breaking of so much as a

00:31:01.523 --> 00:31:05.819
single law constitutes the
essence of anarchy,

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:09.829
constitutes the essence of
lawlessness,

00:31:09.829 --> 00:31:15.799
it is a far-reaching argument
for obedience to the law.

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:20.603
The breaking of even a single
law calls into question the

00:31:20.603 --> 00:31:25.478
authority of law as such.
It's a very powerful argument

00:31:25.478 --> 00:31:29.535
that, in a way,
Socrates makes against himself,

00:31:29.535 --> 00:31:33.769
putting that speech in the
mouth of the laws.

00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:36.829
But he goes even further than
this.

00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:39.086
The citizen,
he says, owes his very

00:31:39.086 --> 00:31:43.287
existence to the laws.
We are what we are because of

00:31:43.287 --> 00:31:47.603
the power and authority of the
laws, the customs,

00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:52.099
the traditions,
the culture that has shaped us.

00:31:52.099 --> 00:31:56.017
The laws, he says,
have begat us and the use of

00:31:56.017 --> 00:32:00.615
the term "begat" in our
translation is clearly intended

00:32:00.615 --> 00:32:05.724
to resonate with something you
might say we might think of as

00:32:05.724 --> 00:32:10.583
something biblical about it.
The citizen is,

00:32:10.583 --> 00:32:16.865
in a word, created,
begat by the laws themselves,

00:32:16.865 --> 00:32:23.933
they exercise a kind of
paternal authority over us such

00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:31.786
that disobedience to any law
constitutes an act of impiety or

00:32:31.786 --> 00:32:38.200
disrespect of the oldest things
around us.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.207
The laws are not only like our
parents, they are like our

00:32:43.207 --> 00:32:47.500
ancestors, the founding fathers,
as we might say,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.840
who are owed respect and piety.
In many ways,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.914
the Crito,
in some respect,

00:32:54.914 --> 00:32:58.640
is the platonic dialogue about
piety.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.760
Socrates seems to accept here
entirely the authority of the

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.649
law;
he does not offer arguments for

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:10.380
non compliance as he does in the
Apology,

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.334
so what happened all of a
sudden to Socrates,

00:33:14.334 --> 00:33:17.569
the apostle of civil
disobedience,

00:33:17.569 --> 00:33:21.460
Socrates the apostle of
principled abstention?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.627
He accepts entirely,
or the laws force him to accept

00:33:25.627 --> 00:33:30.367
entirely, the covenant that
every citizen has with the laws

00:33:30.367 --> 00:33:33.799
that binds them to absolute
obedience.

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:37.814
The question is,
why does Socrates exhibit such

00:33:37.814 --> 00:33:42.091
proud defiance and independence
of the laws in the

00:33:42.091 --> 00:33:45.515
Apology,
and such total,

00:33:45.515 --> 00:33:51.987
even kind of mouse-like,
acquiescence to the laws in the

00:33:51.987 --> 00:33:56.336
Crito?
What happened to him,

00:33:56.336 --> 00:34:02.678
I mean why does he all of a
sudden become so humble and

00:34:02.678 --> 00:34:05.890
acquiescent?
What happened to his language

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.540
about being the gift of the god?

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:14.084
Well, that's something I want
you to think about and maybe I'm

00:34:14.084 --> 00:34:16.940
sure you'll want to talk about
in your sections,

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.799
but let me propose something
like the following to answer or

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:24.930
at least to respond to this
paradox,

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:25.670
this question.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:35.797
The Apology and the
Crito represent a

00:34:35.797 --> 00:34:41.932
tension, they represent even a
conflict between two more or

00:34:41.932 --> 00:34:47.219
less permanent and
irreconcilable moral codes.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.997
The one represented by Socrates
regards reason,

00:34:50.997 --> 00:34:54.446
that is to say,
the sovereign reason of the

00:34:54.446 --> 00:34:58.469
individual as the highest
possible authority.

00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:02.696
It is the philosopher's
reliance on his own reason that

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:06.923
frees him from the dangerous
authority of the state and

00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:11.698
safeguards the individual from
complicity in the injustice and

00:35:11.698 --> 00:35:15.612
evils that seem to be a
necessary part of political

00:35:15.612 --> 00:35:17.989
life.
Here is Socrates,

00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:22.150
the principled abstainer,
but the other moral code is

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:27.269
represented by the speech of the
laws where it is the laws of the

00:35:27.269 --> 00:35:30.818
community,
its oldest and deepest beliefs

00:35:30.818 --> 00:35:33.481
and institutions,
its constitution,

00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:37.635
its regime as we would say,
its politea,

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:42.768
that are fundamentally
obligatory on the individual and

00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:46.760
even take priority over the
individual.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.663
The one point of view takes the
philosophic life,

00:35:49.663 --> 00:35:52.204
the examined life,
to be the one most worth

00:35:52.204 --> 00:35:54.659
living;
the other takes the political

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:58.052
life, the life of the citizen
engaged in the business of

00:35:58.052 --> 00:36:00.201
deliberating,
legislating,

00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:05.428
making war and peace as the
highest calling for a human

00:36:05.428 --> 00:36:07.993
being.
These constitute two

00:36:07.993 --> 00:36:12.310
irreconcilable alternatives,
two different callings,

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.009
so to speak,
and any attempt,

00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:20.013
I think, to reconcile or to
synthesize these two can only

00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:23.230
lead to a deep injustice to
each.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:28.103
Plato seems to believe that
each of us must choose somehow,

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:33.060
must choose between one or the
other of these two contenders

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.429
for the most serious and
worthwhile way of life.

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:41.500
Which do we take,
which is the matter of ultimate

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.620
concern or care for us?

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.489
Which?
But we cannot have both and I

00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:53.988
think that distinction to some
degree captures the differences

00:36:53.988 --> 00:36:58.341
set out when I asked at the
beginning of the class about who

00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:02.767
believes Socrates is innocent
and should be acquitted and who

00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:06.750
believes he is guilty and should
be condemned between a

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.659
philosophical and a political
point of view.

00:37:10.659 --> 00:37:14.499
And, in a sense,
one could say maybe this is not

00:37:14.499 --> 00:37:18.502
Plato's last word,
I mean why does Socrates choose

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:23.850
to stay and drink the hemlock?
After all, if he is committed

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.369
fundamentally to the principles
of his own reason,

00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:33.236
still why should he care that
much about the laws of the city,

00:37:33.236 --> 00:37:37.783
why not let Crito help him
escape and go to Crete where he

00:37:37.783 --> 00:37:42.489
can drink the good wine of Crete
and enjoy his old age?

00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:44.993
And in fact,
Plato wrote another dialogue,

00:37:44.993 --> 00:37:48.289
his largest dialogue,
a book called The Laws,

00:37:48.289 --> 00:37:53.704
where you see a man simply
designated as the Athenian

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:59.847
stranger living in Crete and
carrying on a conversation with

00:37:59.847 --> 00:38:05.469
representatives of that society
and that might be,

00:38:05.469 --> 00:38:08.808
although he is not identified
as Socrates, it is sometimes

00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:12.088
thought here is the kind of
speech or discussion Socrates

00:38:12.088 --> 00:38:15.340
would be having,
had he escaped.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.786
But it gets back to the
question, are the reasons

00:38:18.786 --> 00:38:22.090
Socrates gives Crito for
refusing to escape,

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.661
the reasons he puts in the
mouth of the laws of the city of

00:38:25.661 --> 00:38:28.309
Athens, are those Socrates' true
reasons?

00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:32.396
Does Socrates believe that
speech that he constructs

00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:37.284
between himself and the laws or
is it simply a fiction that he

00:38:37.284 --> 00:38:41.291
creates for the sake of
relieving his friend of the

00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:46.500
guilt he evidently feels for
being unable to help Socrates?

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.187
Crito is, of course,
very concerned with what people

00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:56.702
will think of him if it becomes
known that he has somehow not

00:38:56.702 --> 00:39:02.002
helped Socrates to escape.
Is that speech for the law,

00:39:02.002 --> 00:39:06.239
with the laws,
really intended for the benefit

00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:09.569
of Crito,
rather than an expression of

00:39:09.569 --> 00:39:14.518
Socrates' deepest opinions about
the questions of obligation and

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:17.906
obedience?
Is he, in that speech,

00:39:17.906 --> 00:39:24.253
bestowing as it were a kind of
justice to Crito to reconcile

00:39:24.253 --> 00:39:30.170
him to the laws of the city and
to give him reasons,

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:34.155
you might say rational
considerations,

00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:38.139
for continued obedience to the
law?

00:39:38.139 --> 00:39:42.434
In many ways that would seem to
make a certain sense of the

00:39:42.434 --> 00:39:46.210
apparent discrepancy between
these two dialogues.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:50.187
It demonstrates not only
Socrates' sense of his

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:53.300
superiority to the laws of
Athens.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.708
In the first speech of the
Apology,

00:39:56.708 --> 00:40:00.947
he defies the city to put him
to death by expressing

00:40:00.947 --> 00:40:05.519
indifference to death and then
in the Crito,

00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:09.626
he very much expresses that
indifference to death by

00:40:09.626 --> 00:40:13.170
refusing to allow Crito to let
him escape.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.395
Socrates seems to remain,
even until the end,

00:40:16.395 --> 00:40:20.940
very much a kind of law unto
himself while at the same time,

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:26.532
again, providing Crito and
others like him an example of

00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:31.210
rational and dignified obedience
to the law.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.710
When we look at the death of
Socrates, do we think of it as a

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:41.934
tragedy, as a moral tragedy,
a just man sentenced to death

00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:47.030
by an unjust law?
I don't think so.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:51.295
Far from it.
Socrates' death at the age of

00:40:51.295 --> 00:40:56.501
70 was intended by him as an act
of philosophical martyrdom that

00:40:56.501 --> 00:41:01.458
would allow future philosophy to
be favorably recognized as a

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:07.214
source of courage and justice.
In one of his later letters,

00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:12.944
Plato refers to his depiction
of Socrates, as he says his

00:41:12.944 --> 00:41:18.059
attempt to render Socrates young
and beautiful,

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:22.337
that is he consciously set out
to beautify Socrates,

00:41:22.337 --> 00:41:25.860
presenting a man,
fearless before death,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.024
refusing to participate in any
active injustice while

00:41:30.024 --> 00:41:34.590
dispensing wisdom and justice to
those who will listen.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.497
We don't know the real
Socrates, all we know of

00:41:38.497 --> 00:41:43.169
Socrates is what we read in
Plato and Aristophanes and a

00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:48.011
small number of others who have
sketched various different

00:41:48.011 --> 00:41:51.576
pictures of him.
But Plato's Socrates is

00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:56.001
necessarily poles apart from
Aristophanes' Socrates depiction

00:41:56.001 --> 00:42:00.427
of him as a sort of sophist who
makes the weaker argument the

00:42:00.427 --> 00:42:02.548
stronger.
Plato's dialogues,

00:42:02.548 --> 00:42:05.934
the Apology as well as
the Republic and the

00:42:05.934 --> 00:42:09.199
Crito are in the broadest
sense of the term,

00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:15.061
an attempt not only to answer
the charge against Aristophanes

00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:20.922
but also defend the cause of
philosophy as something of value

00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:25.060
and merit.
Where does that leave us today?

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:30.327
What are we to make of all this?
We, who live in a very

00:42:30.327 --> 00:42:33.564
different kind of world from
that of, you know,

00:42:33.564 --> 00:42:36.941
fourth-century Athens,
what can we learn from the

00:42:36.941 --> 00:42:41.069
example of Socrates?
Most of us like most of you

00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:45.897
earlier, find ourselves
instinctively taking the side of

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.320
Socrates against the city of
Athens.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.250
Those who might defend the city
of Athens against Socrates,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:59.094
those who believe in the value
of civic piety are very few

00:42:59.094 --> 00:43:02.775
among us.
Perhaps only those of you who

00:43:02.775 --> 00:43:08.280
might come from a small town in
the south or from certain areas

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.164
of Brooklyn would understand
something about the supreme

00:43:13.164 --> 00:43:18.668
value of piety as a way of life.
We, by and large,

00:43:18.668 --> 00:43:25.453
tend to accept the picture of
Socrates as a victim of

00:43:25.453 --> 00:43:28.030
injustice.
We overlook,

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.847
we conveniently overlook a
number of facts about him,

00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:34.794
his hostility to democracy,
we'll see that in the

00:43:34.794 --> 00:43:36.991
Republic but we've seen
it already to some degree in the

00:43:36.991 --> 00:43:39.920
Apology.
His claim that the lives of his

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.206
fellow citizens are not worth
living and his claim that his

00:43:44.206 --> 00:43:48.566
way of life has been commanded
by a god that no one else has

00:43:48.566 --> 00:43:52.183
ever heard or seen.
None of these seem to make any

00:43:52.183 --> 00:43:55.010
difference to us and yet I think
they should.

00:43:58.199 --> 00:44:01.867
Given Socrates' claims,
ask yourself what would a

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:06.375
responsible body of citizens
have done, how should they have

00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:09.190
acted?
One answer might be to extend

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.010
greater toleration to civil
dissidents like Socrates.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.055
Individuals of heterodox belief
but whose own views may

00:44:17.055 --> 00:44:21.250
stimulate others to question and
think for themselves,

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.749
all to the good,
Milton, John Locke,

00:44:23.749 --> 00:44:27.320
people like Voltaire argued
something like this.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.070
But is that to do justice to
Socrates?

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:34.607
The one thing that Plato does
not argue is that Socrates

00:44:34.607 --> 00:44:39.050
should simply be tolerated.
To tolerate his teaching would

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:43.150
seem to trivialize it in some
sense, to render it harmless.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:47.737
The Athenians at least pay
Socrates the tribute of taking

00:44:47.737 --> 00:44:51.260
him seriously,
which is exactly why he is on

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.643
trial.
The Athenians refuse to

00:44:53.643 --> 00:44:57.449
tolerate Socrates because they
know he is not harmless,

00:44:57.449 --> 00:45:01.141
that he poses a challenge,
a fundamental challenge to

00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:05.045
their way of life and all that
they hold to be noble and

00:45:05.045 --> 00:45:07.968
worthwhile.
Socrates is not harmless

00:45:07.968 --> 00:45:12.382
because of his own professed
ability to attract followers,

00:45:12.382 --> 00:45:15.170
a few today,
a few more tomorrow.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.870
Who knows?
To tolerate Socrates would be

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.635
to say to him that we care
little for our way of life and

00:45:21.635 --> 00:45:25.804
that we are willing to let you
challenge it and impugn it every

00:45:25.804 --> 00:45:29.090
day.
Is that good, is that right?

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:34.549
The trial of Socrates asks us
to think about the limits of

00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:39.147
toleration, what views,
if any, do we find simply

00:45:39.147 --> 00:45:43.223
intolerable?
Is a healthy society one that

00:45:43.223 --> 00:45:48.573
is literally open to every point
of view, freedom of speech is

00:45:48.573 --> 00:45:53.309
naturally a cherished good,
is it the supreme good?

00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:58.652
Should it trump all other goods
or does toleration reach a point

00:45:58.652 --> 00:46:03.740
when it ceases to be toleration
and becomes in fact a kind of

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:08.829
soft nihilism that can extend
liberty to everything precisely

00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:12.730
because it takes nothing very
seriously.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.391
And by nihilism,
I mean the view that every

00:46:16.391 --> 00:46:20.139
preference, however squalid,
base or sordid,

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:25.369
must be regarded as the
legitimate equal of every other.

00:46:25.369 --> 00:46:29.884
Is this really tolerance or is
it rather a form of moral decay

00:46:29.884 --> 00:46:34.175
that has simply decided to
abandon the search for truth and

00:46:34.175 --> 00:46:37.288
standards of judgment?
There's a danger,

00:46:37.288 --> 00:46:41.624
I think, that endless tolerance
leads to intellectual passivity

00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:45.330
and the kind of uncritical
acceptance of all points of

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:49.719
view.
Well so much for that.

00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:52.640
What I want to do,
I see we're running out of

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.230
time, is if you could think
about it,

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.830
maybe hold that thought in your
mind once in a while between now

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:04.787
and Wednesday and on Wednesday,
we will begin reading what is

00:47:04.787 --> 00:47:09.883
arguably, some people believe,
the most important book ever

00:47:09.883 --> 00:47:13.110
written,
Plato's Republic.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.576
See you on Wednesday.

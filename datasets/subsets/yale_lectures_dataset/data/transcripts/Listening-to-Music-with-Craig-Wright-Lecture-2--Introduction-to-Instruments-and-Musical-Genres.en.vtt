00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.010
Prof: Okay. Good morning.
 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.376
Over the weekend,
you were assigned material from

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:12.584
chapter one of the text and it
dealt really with three famous

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:15.670
beginnings of pieces of
classical music.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.956
Somebody tell me at the outset:
what were those three famous

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:20.610
pieces?
 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.570
Young lady down here.
 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.720
Student: The first was
Beethoven's.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.580
Prof: Okay,
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.540
What was the second one?
 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.244
Student: I believe it
was Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:32.830
Number One.
 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.182
Prof: Yeah,
Piano Concerto Number One of

00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:36.870
Tchaikovsky, and the third one?
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.920
Student:
&gt;

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.559
Prof: Yeah,
this piece by Richard Strauss

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.920
with this funny sounding German
name.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.065
We'll just call it
Zarathustra, this

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.240
prophet, Zarathustra.
 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.551
So those are the three pieces
and the issues there had to do

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:51.919
with musical genre that we're
going to talk a little bit more

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:56.210
about in a moment,
and the instruments.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.994
And you went ahead and worked
with the Listening Exercises

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:04.045
nine through eleven to engage
the musical instruments a bit in

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.311
those particular exercises,
and we have performers here

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.594
today that are going to,
as you can see,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:13.230
demonstrate some of these
instruments for us.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.010
Let's make one point very clear
at the outset.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.598
Oftentimes I get student papers
that refer to "Beethoven's

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.144
fifth song"
or "Tchaikovsky's first

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.360
piano song."
 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.569
Is that right?
 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.930
No, that's not good at all.
 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.840
Are these songs?
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.000
What do you have to have to
make something a song?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.959
Student: Lyrics.
 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.102
Prof: Lyrics.
 

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.300
You've got to have a text and
so we don't have--in eighty

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.269
percent of classical music--we
don't have lyrics;

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:46.610
we don't have a text.
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.266
Well, yes, with opera of
course, but the other eighty

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.010
percent is purely instrumental
music.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.077
It works its magic,
again, through purely

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.557
instrumental means,
so we can't really call those

00:01:57.557 --> 00:01:59.160
songs, and this puzzled me.
 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.619
One day I was sitting there at
iTunes and I wanted to buy an

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.927
interior movement of a Mozart
serenade so I was all set to

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:13.159
purchase this and it said,
"Buy song."

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.110
Boom.
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.669
That told me the answer.
 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.129
That's where this terminology
comes in to play because on

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.490
iTunes we buy songs.
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.155
It could be purely instrumental
but it's called "buy a

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:28.008
song," but we don't want to
use that sort of parlance.

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.030
We want to be more--a bit more
sophisticated than that,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.888
if you will,
and use other terms,

00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:36.081
so we'll talk generally about
Beethoven's composition or

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:39.449
Beethoven's piece or Beethoven's
work or his master work or

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.400
chef d'oeuvre or however
fancy you want to get with it.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.193
We could also go on and be a
little more precise and say it

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:50.840
belongs to a particular genre.
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.913
We could use the name of a
genre, and I'll be talking a lot

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.449
about genre in this course.
 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.360
"Genre"
is simply a fancy word for

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.729
"type"
or "kind"

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.979
so what genre of piece is this
by Beethoven?

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:04.990
Well, it's a symphony.
 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.979
Symphonies generally have four
movements.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.479
What's a movement?
 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.108
Well, a movement is simply an
independent piece that works

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.597
oftentimes--
if there are multiple movements

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.580
in a symphony or concerto--
works with other movements.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.568
They are independent yet they
are complementary.

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.199
Think of, for example,
a sculpture garden.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.913
You might have four independent
sculptures in there,

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:34.785
but they relate one to another;
they make some sort of special

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:37.068
sense one to another.
 

00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:40.756
So symphonies have these four
movements and they usually

00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:44.508
operate in the following way:
A fast opening movement;

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:47.280
a slower, more lyrical second
movement;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.318
then a third movement that's
derived from dance;

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:54.422
and then a fourth movement
that's sort of again "up

00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:57.479
tempo," fast,
emphatic conclusion.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.570
Let's see how these play out by
means of a quick review of

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.733
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony so
all we're going to do here is

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:09.752
going to go from the beginning
of the track for the first

00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:13.270
movement to the second movement
and so on,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.669
and well, let's just start here.
 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.829
Let's just, by way of
refreshing our memory,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.209
the beginning of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony.

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:40.720
&gt;
 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.507
Let's pause it there,
and as we said last time,

00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:48.050
it operates &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.718
in that fashion,
and that beginning gives us a

00:04:50.718 --> 00:04:54.158
good opportunity to make a
distinction between two types of

00:04:54.158 --> 00:04:57.658
melody,
between this idea of a motive

00:04:57.658 --> 00:04:58.910
and a theme.
 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.740
Both are sort of subsets of
melody, if you will.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.194
As I say in the textbook there,
the beginning of the Beethoven

00:05:07.194 --> 00:05:10.084
Fifth is something like a
musical punch in the nose.

00:05:10.084 --> 00:05:10.423
Right?
 

00:05:10.423 --> 00:05:11.838
&gt;
 

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:13.963
Sort of grabbing you here,
hitting you in the face,

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:14.899
whatever, musically.
 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.040
It's not a very long idea.
 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.740
How many notes is in this
opening gambit here?

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.519
How many pitches?
 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.060
Four, &gt;
 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.189
short, short, short, long.
 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.605
Okay.
 

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:28.009
So that's a classic example of
a motive.

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.523
A motive is just a little cell,
a germ, out of which the

00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:32.579
composer will build other
musical material.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:36.262
Now let's contrast that with
what happens in the second

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:39.877
movement of Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony where we have a

00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:42.129
lyrical, long,
flowing theme.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.949
Okay?
 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:06:00.850
&gt;
 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.240
Okay. We'll stop there.
 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.069
All right?
 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.225
So that went on--If we heard
the whole thing,

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:10.386
it actually goes on for 32
notes as opposed to just four so

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:12.610
motive versus longer theme.
 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.319
Themes tend maybe a little bit
more lyrical.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.589
Now let's go on to the third
movement.

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.502
We said the third movement was
dance derived,

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:24.608
but in this case with Beethoven
it's a very strange dance if it

00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:26.000
is dance derived.
 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.259
It's just a little bit
different than most of these

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.389
third movements,
but let's listen to it anyway

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.319
because I'd like you to--
when the brasses come in--think

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.422
about what you're hearing and
think about that

00:06:34.422 --> 00:06:36.620
vis-Ã -vis the
first movement,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.629
so let's hear the third
movement now.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:07:15.810
&gt;
 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.000
Okay.
 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.879
So what happened there when the
brasses came in?

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.170
How did that relate to the
first movement?

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.920
Yes? Student: Four notes?
 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.189
Prof: Four notes,
something as simple as that,

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:26.062
&gt;
 

00:07:26.062 --> 00:07:28.244
, same rhythmic idea,
so that's the use of a motive

00:07:28.244 --> 00:07:30.644
there and that's how these
movements are tied together a

00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:31.430
little bit.
 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.254
Let's go on to the finale now,
and as we listen to the finale

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:37.221
let's think about what we heard
at the very beginning and talked

00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:40.980
about last time,
&gt;

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.178
about the mood that the
beginning of the Fifth Symphony

00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:43.870
created for it.
 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.040
We have these adjectives up
here, "negative,"

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.850
"anxious,"
"unsettled."

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.050
Well, how do we feel now about
the finale and why?

00:07:52.050 --> 00:08:27.759
&gt;
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.250
So why do we feel differently
about that?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.629
I think we do.
 

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:32.639
What do we feel there?
 

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.610
Well, sort of upbeat, positive.
 

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.620
What's turned all of this
around, what specifically?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.767
Well, with the first movement
we said he's generally going

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:43.480
&gt;
 

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.366
and that kind of idea,
but now it's &lt;&lt;music

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:47.389
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:49.460
and we'll explore this when we
get to harmony,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.034
this idea of major and minor so
we're going &lt;&lt;music

00:08:52.034 --> 00:08:52.908
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:55.029
and now &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:57.460
and that's a change from the
dark minor to the brighter

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:57.820
major.
 

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.288
We were going down in the first
movement.

00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:03.710
Now we're going-- &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.465
It's going up and instead of
having just the violins playing

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:11.769
we have the trumpets,
the heroic trumpets,

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:14.428
so it sounds very triumphant.
 

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:17.809
So in this 40-minute interval
we've gone sort of through an

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:20.548
emotional musical journey here
from despair,

00:09:20.548 --> 00:09:21.889
despondency,
uncertainty,

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.899
to whatever- to personal
triumph,

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:27.952
and in a way that mirrors some
of the things that were going on

00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:29.389
in Beethoven's life.
 

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.962
Okay.
 

00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:35.009
Let's go on to talk about the
second piece.

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:36.431
We finished with this idea of
the genre, of the four

00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:37.907
movements, so then let's go on
to talk about the piano

00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:38.269
concerto.
 

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:40.279
Concertos are generally in
three movements.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.360
The concerto is another genre.
 

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.798
It's a genre in which a soloist
will confront the orchestra and

00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:51.738
there'll be a kind of give and
take--a spirited give and

00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:53.600
take--between the two.
 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.022
So now we are going to listen
to the beginning of the first

00:09:57.022 --> 00:09:59.558
movement of Tchaikovsky's Piano
Concerto.

00:09:59.558 --> 00:10:02.495
You've worked with this already
so you're a little bit familiar

00:10:02.495 --> 00:10:05.480
with it, and at the outset here
I have two questions for you.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:12.850
Is the beginning here played by
the brasses or the strings?

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.970
In other words,
what--or the woodwinds--

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.953
what family of instruments is
playing here and is Tchaikovsky

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:23.004
using a motive or is he using a
theme at the very beginning of

00:10:23.004 --> 00:10:24.200
this concerto?
 

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:58.610
&gt;
 

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.899
So what about that?
 

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:02.210
Theme or motive at the
beginning?

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.950
Student: Motive.
 

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.500
Prof: Motive. All right.
 

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.919
So here it was I think.
 

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:06.570
&gt;
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.398
How many notes in our motive?
 

00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:10.289
&gt;
 

00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:11.429
Same as in the Beethoven.
 

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:13.090
Why isn't it the same?
 

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.998
Well, we've got a skippy
Beethoven &lt;&lt;music

00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:17.048
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:20.556
but here with Tchaikovsky he's
coming down, just straight down,

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:22.308
&gt;
 

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:25.558
down consecutive intervals
there for the most part.

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:28.176
And both of them are,
however, minor.

00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:30.428
&gt;
 

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:33.850
With the Tchaikovsky they--all
the intervals are the--the

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.658
durations are the same,
&gt;

00:11:36.658 --> 00:11:39.960
but with the Beethoven,
&gt;

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.389
short, short, short, long.
 

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:45.371
So Tchaikovsky is a little bit
more neutral in terms of the

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:45.990
rhythm.
 

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.350
Okay.
 

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.159
So then we go on and the piano
enters.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:50.908
What is the piano doing?
 

00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:53.779
So let's hear the piano come in
just a bit.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:59.590
&gt;
 

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.668
So what's the piano up to?
 

00:12:01.668 --> 00:12:07.638
Well, the piano is just playing
chords, &lt;&lt;music

00:12:07.638 --> 00:12:09.590
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.908
playing them in octave
successions, and we'll talk

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:15.278
about that a little bit more
too.

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:20.009
So what do we have here in this
next section?

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:22.759
Do we have a theme or do we
have a motive and which do

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:24.418
this--are the violins playing?
 

00:12:24.418 --> 00:12:27.658
Are they--Do they have the
theme or the motive or does the

00:12:27.658 --> 00:12:29.759
piano have the theme or the
motive?

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:40.936
Let's listen.
 

00:12:40.936 --> 00:13:06.730
&gt;
 

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.769
So was--what the--what were the
violins playing?

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:13.110
Theme or motive?
 

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.070
Theme. What was the piano doing?
 

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.613
Student:
*.

00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:26.462
Prof: Yeah,
just the same chords

00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:30.928
&gt;
 

00:13:30.928 --> 00:13:34.008
&gt;
 

00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:37.549
in that fashion.
 

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:38.558
I'm singing the melody.
 

00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:41.509
They're playing a chordal
accompaniment against it.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:42.336
All right.
 

00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:46.470
Let's listen to the next
iteration of this theme.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.710
We've identified this as a
theme.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.190
Who's got the theme now?
 

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.389
Is it exactly the same?
 

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:53.860
And what are the strings up to
in terms of string technique

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.279
here?
 

00:13:54.279 --> 00:14:25.600
&gt;
 

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.820
So who had the theme?
 

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.120
The piano now,
but was it exactly the same?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.769
Not really.
 

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:33.763
It was kind of noodling around
with it, varying it a little

00:14:33.763 --> 00:14:33.970
bit.
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.000
What were the strings doing?
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.178
They were playing the
accompaniment,

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:39.658
and what string technique were
they using?

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:42.289
I think we mentioned that in
the first chapter of the book

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:42.659
there.
 

00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:43.590
Yeah, you've got it.
 

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.658
Nice and loud please?
 

00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:45.105
Student: Pizzicato..
 

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:45.486
Prof: Pizzicato.
 

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:45.620
Good.
 

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.720
Okay, pizzicato.
 

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.889
We could write that--Did we
write that as a term up--Yeah.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:49.097
Okay.
 

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.519
We've got it up there,
pizzicato.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.509
That's a help.
 

00:14:51.509 --> 00:15:00.509
So in that particular case
we've switched the roles around.

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:03.620
We're going to move this along
just a little bit here.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.995
As we come back in to this,
I think we've got a situation

00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:10.009
where the piano keeps playing
the four-note motive,

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:12.000
&gt;
 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.668
the part like he was building
it up for tension.

00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:16.070
Then there's a cascade and then
the theme comes back.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.700
Let's see what happens here,
&gt;

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.518
just the motif,
one, two, three,

00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:24.804
four, three four,
one two, &lt;&lt;music

00:15:24.804 --> 00:15:25.918
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:33.298
and then the theme.
 

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:44.950
&gt;
 

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.860
The piano is playing
&gt;

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.750
, ornamenting.
 

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.484
All right.
 

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:57.038
So that's an introduction to a
three-movement piano concerto.

00:15:57.038 --> 00:15:59.461
It happens to be the first of
these three movements and it's

00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:00.570
pretty spectacular music.
 

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.048
I hope you like that music.
 

00:16:03.048 --> 00:16:04.658
It's one of the great melodies
of all time.

00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:08.899
It's a wonderful example of a
theme.

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.102
Having talked just a little bit
about genres,

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:16.325
we could conclude by saying
there are other kinds of genres

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:18.000
in music of course.
 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.548
We've been introduced to this
idea of the tone poem.

00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:25.019
The Strauss Zarathustra
is a tone poem.

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:29.272
That's a one-movement work in
which the composer tries to tell

00:16:29.272 --> 00:16:32.340
a story or play out an historic
event or,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.727
in the case of the Strauss,
to give us the beginning of the

00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:38.649
contents of a philosophical
novel through music.

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:41.118
So tone poems are one in
movement, and we have got other

00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:42.330
kinds of genres in music.
 

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.379
We've got opera.
 

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:45.576
We've got cantatas,
sonatas, ballets,

00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:48.626
things such as this,
and we'll get to each of those

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:49.360
in turn.
 

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.009
So that's the end of the
discussion of genre.

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:56.662
Let's go on now to talk about
instruments and how instruments

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:57.370
produce sound.
 

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.899
Eva Heater, come on up.
 

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:02.009
This is my friend,
long-time colleague,

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:04.038
music librarian extraordinaire
and professional French horn

00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:05.784
player,
Eva Heater, who will

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:08.586
demonstrate here--
Come on over here right in the

00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:08.980
center.
 

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.259
Gene Kimball is in the basement
somewhere recording all of this.

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:12.834
Eva Heater:
Oh, my..

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:13.298
Prof: Oh,
yeah.

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:13.940
It's very exciting here.
 

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.279
What a time to be alive, huh?
 

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:17.598
Eva Heater: Yeah.
 

00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:21.260
Prof: So Eva is going to
just demonstrate the physical

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.519
process of playing the French
horn.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:25.676
Eva Heater:
The horn obviously is a

00:17:25.676 --> 00:17:28.941
brass instrument and what makes
the sound is a vibrating column

00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:29.519
of air.
 

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:31.930
In this case,
the basic column of air is

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.453
twelve and a half feet long and
there are something called

00:17:35.453 --> 00:17:37.988
"partials"
or the "harmonic

00:17:37.988 --> 00:17:40.769
series" that happens in
anything,

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:44.038
on a string instrument or
whatever,

00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:45.625
but on the horn it's very
distinct and that's what makes

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:46.259
the different notes.
 

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:50.160
Let me demonstrate to you the
harmonic series.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:18:07.038
&gt;
 

00:18:07.038 --> 00:18:10.654
Now I didn't use--no
hands--that was just the notes

00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:14.778
that are naturally on the twelve
and a half-foot length of

00:18:14.778 --> 00:18:16.078
vibrating air.
 

00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:19.730
That's the harmonic series
that's on that,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.621
and what the valves do is they
shorten and lengthen that

00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:27.653
vibrating column of air very
much like the cello string on

00:18:27.653 --> 00:18:29.068
the fingerboard.
 

00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:33.779
A cellist is always shortening
and lengthening the strings.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.308
I'm doing the same thing.
 

00:18:35.308 --> 00:18:38.556
I'm just doing it with a series
of switches instead of a

00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:41.328
fingerboard, which we obviously
don't have--

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.246
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:43.246 --> 00:18:44.522
That's fine.
 

00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:46.118
That's great.
 

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:47.578
That's the principle,
and when she said she was

00:18:47.578 --> 00:18:49.038
"overblowing"
what that means is,

00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:52.400
and we'll keep emphasizing this
point today--

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.097
these partials--that when a
sound is made you have not just

00:18:56.097 --> 00:18:59.670
one sound but that tube is
dividing up into sections,

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.853
and all kinds of little
sections of that one tube are

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.907
sounding,
not just the big sound but the

00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:10.084
partials or the overtones,
the intervals in the harmonic

00:19:10.084 --> 00:19:10.740
series.
 

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.913
So it's a whole series--when we
listen to a single tone it's a

00:19:14.913 --> 00:19:17.338
whole series,
and what Eva was doing there is

00:19:17.338 --> 00:19:19.569
playing out the notes in that
series successively,

00:19:19.569 --> 00:19:21.180
and we'll keep banging on that.
 

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.498
Now if you would,
Eva, play just the beginning of

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.609
the Zarathustra or the
trumpet part.

00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:30.289
Can you do that?
 

00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:52.319
&gt;
 

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:54.089
Go, Eva. Go.
 

00:19:54.089 --> 00:20:07.430
&gt;
 

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.509
One more time.
 

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:19.940
&gt;
 

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.630
Okay, and that's another note.
 

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.740
Thank you very much.
 

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.339
Thank you. Thank you.
 

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:27.068
Okay.
 

00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:30.363
Now Eva has another gig out in
Gilford this morning so she's

00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:32.878
going to run off,
and I'm going to show you,

00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:34.869
maybe, if we can get our slides
up,

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.579
this overtone series stuff.
 

00:20:36.579 --> 00:20:37.598
Okay?
 

00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:50.979
Eva Heater:
Okay.

00:20:50.979 --> 00:21:08.430
It's a mathematical thing too.
 

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:18.318
It's all math.
 

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:19.460
Prof: What we've got
here is the following,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.098
this idea of partials that Eva
was talking about with ratios,

00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:26.038
two to one, three to two,
four to three,

00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:29.088
five to four,
six to five and so on,

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:34.189
and the point here is that the
way we differentiate between

00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:35.420
instruments.
 

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.720
Can anybody tell me this,
why--You tell me this.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.578
It's always better when
students answer.

00:21:39.578 --> 00:21:43.324
Why does a trumpet--If I asked
a trumpet to play this pitch,

00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:46.116
a trumpet played,
and then I asked an oboe to

00:21:46.116 --> 00:21:49.099
play it, the sound would be very
different.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.470
Why is that the case?
 

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.890
Gentleman here?
 

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:54.970
Student: Different
overtones?

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.368
Prof: Different
overtones.

00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:59.539
Well, actually they all have
the same overtones in a way,

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:02.144
the same frequencies will
sound, but you've got

00:22:02.144 --> 00:22:04.068
it--ninety-nine percent of it.
 

00:22:04.068 --> 00:22:07.588
It's which partials are
particularly prominent,

00:22:07.588 --> 00:22:10.880
have extra punch or extra
volume to them.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.772
The oboe may have the seventh
partial very strong and the

00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:18.180
third partial very strong
whereas the trumpet--

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.950
I'm just making all of this up
of course--

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.869
the trumpet may have the second
partial and the fourth partial

00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:24.019
and the sixth partial.
 

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:27.127
So it's which of these partials
are sounding within each of

00:22:27.127 --> 00:22:29.701
these instruments,
and the physical properties of

00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:32.059
each of these instruments are
different.

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.990
It's the particular blend.
 

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.980
Here's a really dumb analogy.
 

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.349
Any Scotch drinkers in here?
 

00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:38.318
No, of course not.
 

00:22:38.318 --> 00:22:41.005
You're way too young to do
that, but think about a blended

00:22:41.005 --> 00:22:41.430
Scotch.
 

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.788
You've got a little of this,
a little of this,

00:22:42.788 --> 00:22:45.239
a little of this,
and it makes up whatever it is

00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:48.345
that you end up with,
the particular recipe for that

00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:48.838
liquid.
 

00:22:48.838 --> 00:22:53.333
Well, we have a particular
recipe for instrumental timbre

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:58.146
or instrumental color and it's
the intensity of the overtones

00:22:58.146 --> 00:23:00.412
with--
or partials--within each

00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:02.910
particular instrument that
creates that.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.148
Okay.
 

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:06.028
Now we're going to go on and
talk about a woodwind instrument

00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:07.420
here so Lynda,
come on up.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.538
Lynda is a bassoonist.
 

00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:14.900
This is Lynda Paul who will be
one of our principal TAs here.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.710
She is a PhD candidate in the
department of music,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.730
just passed her qualifying exam
with flying colors,

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.608
so here she is to demonstrate
the bassoon for us,

00:23:24.608 --> 00:23:27.200
lowest member of the woodwind
family.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.542
Lynda Paul:
All right.

00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:31.086
So you probably read in the
book that the bassoon is a

00:23:31.086 --> 00:23:33.311
double reed instrument,
and so just to show you what

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:35.644
that looks like--
You've probably seen it but if

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:37.965
you haven't,
two pieces of wood vibrate

00:23:37.965 --> 00:23:39.980
together when I blow through
them.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.640
&gt;
 

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.588
I always check it out before I
play any notes.

00:23:47.588 --> 00:23:52.799
And, as you will probably
suspect, by the length of the

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:57.336
bassoon it can play very low
notes &lt;&lt;music

00:23:57.336 --> 00:23:59.170
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.627
and if I put a little rag in
the top I can get it even a

00:24:01.627 --> 00:24:04.599
little bit lower than that--
I didn't bring one--but

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:07.212
actually, amazingly,
it's a very versatile

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:09.519
instrument and can also play
very high notes.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:12.490
As you can see,
there are a lot of keys in it.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.255
There are nine keys for my left
thumb alone so I'm kind of

00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:20.220
switching between these on the
back here and many others,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.711
and because of that I can go
very high and I'll just

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:23.640
demonstrate that.
 

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:41.838
&gt;
 

00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:44.578
So that's just to give you a
sense of the range.

00:24:44.578 --> 00:24:47.460
Because of the sort of
particular character of the

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.105
bassoon sound,
it's often used to play sort of

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:53.338
funny, little low-note
characters in the orchestra.

00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:54.661
For example,
if you're familiar with

00:24:54.661 --> 00:24:56.776
Peter and the Wolf,
the different instruments play

00:24:56.776 --> 00:24:57.720
different characters.
 

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.829
The bassoon is the grandfather.
 

00:25:01.829 --> 00:25:25.269
&gt;
 

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.778
Prof: Cool. Okay. Great.
 

00:25:25.778 --> 00:25:26.528
Thanks so much.
 

00:25:26.528 --> 00:25:27.778
That--That's really fun.
 

00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:32.432
Now Jacob Adams is a
professional violist here in New

00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:33.150
Haven.
 

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.890
What's the name of your
quartet, Jacob?

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:35.863
Jacob Adams:
I'm a member of the

00:25:35.863 --> 00:25:36.759
"Vinca String
Quartet."

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:37.934
Prof: The "Vinca
String Quartet"

00:25:37.934 --> 00:25:38.670
so keep an eye out for them.
 

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.509
They're based here in New Haven.
 

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:41.390
So come on out, Jacob.
 

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.502
And he is a violist,
not a violinist,

00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:46.202
but the principle here is
pretty much the same,

00:25:46.202 --> 00:25:49.490
so tell us about the
construction of the instrument.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.397
Jacob Adams:
Okay.

00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:52.632
So obviously we've now seen a
little bit of the brass family

00:25:52.632 --> 00:25:55.531
and the woodwind family,
and the other principal section

00:25:55.531 --> 00:25:58.730
of the orchestra would obviously
be the string family.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.779
The viola is very similar to
the violin so anything I say

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:04.450
about the viola applies to the
violin as well,

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.837
and of course you all are
probably familiar with violins

00:26:06.837 --> 00:26:07.490
and the size.
 

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.009
The violas are a little bit
bigger.

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:15.680
This particular one is about 16
inches long.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.019
Violins are--maybe--go up about
to twelve inches.

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:22.419
They have a slightly smaller
body to them but violins and

00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:25.088
violas have the same general
construction.

00:26:25.088 --> 00:26:29.473
All of the sounds are produced
by the strings on the instrument

00:26:29.473 --> 00:26:33.009
and how the bow is pulled across
the instrument.

00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:36.338
The bow is made out of,
typically, horse hair from the

00:26:36.338 --> 00:26:37.470
tails of horses.
 

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.281
The strings are now metallic
but sixteenth,

00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:43.829
seventeenth to eighteenth
century they would have been

00:26:43.829 --> 00:26:46.038
made out of cat or sheep gut.
 

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:47.680
That was much more common,
and still some people--

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.220
Prof: Okay. So I'm sorry.
 

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.710
We've got lots of things going
on here this morning so just

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:59.278
play a scale quickly and then
vibrato, pizzicato and tremolo

00:26:59.278 --> 00:27:00.130
for us.
 

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.766
Jacob Adams:
So again this is on a viola

00:27:01.766 --> 00:27:03.544
so it has a deeper,
darker timbre than a violin but

00:27:03.544 --> 00:27:04.220
here's a scale.
 

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:11.220
&gt;
 

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:11.778
Prof: Wow.
 

00:27:11.778 --> 00:27:12.960
You did something there at the
end.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.548
Did you have too much coffee
this morning?

00:27:14.548 --> 00:27:15.614
You started shaking over there.
 

00:27:15.614 --> 00:27:15.818
Yeah.
 

00:27:15.818 --> 00:27:18.150
So tell us about what you were
doing there at the end.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.942
Jacob Adams:
So there are all sorts of

00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.104
different little technique
things you can do to create

00:27:22.104 --> 00:27:24.509
different colors and sounds on
all string instruments,

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:25.940
so this applies to any of them.
 

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.946
One of them is the technique
you saw me do with my left hand

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.680
where I wiggled it a little bit.
 

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.788
It's called vibrato.
 

00:27:31.788 --> 00:27:35.009
You hear it in human voices as
well.

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:37.400
You can do it on other
instruments but on a string

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.009
instrument it's the difference.
 

00:27:39.009 --> 00:27:40.983
I'll play a melody without
vibrato and with vibrato so you

00:27:40.983 --> 00:27:41.849
can see the difference.
 

00:27:41.849 --> 00:27:53.598
&gt;
 

00:27:53.598 --> 00:27:56.751
So that's without vibrato,
not that interesting in my

00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:58.390
opinion, so with vibrato.
 

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:11.608
&gt;
 

00:28:11.608 --> 00:28:14.048
And you can vary the width and
the speed and the length.

00:28:14.048 --> 00:28:16.058
There's a lot of varieties
which--

00:28:16.058 --> 00:28:16.859
Prof: Okay.
 

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:18.950
And then just quickly play a
pizzicato for us?

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.179
Jacob Adams:
Sure.

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:26.348
&gt;
 

00:28:26.348 --> 00:28:29.170
Prof: Okay,
and then finally tremolo.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.981
Jacob Adams:
Tremolo,

00:28:30.981 --> 00:28:31.250
yes.
 

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.400
&gt;
 

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.912
Prof: So adds a little
excitement or a little filler to

00:28:35.912 --> 00:28:36.734
the music sometimes.
 

00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:37.846
Jacob Adams:
Uh huh..

00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:38.794
Prof: All right.
 

00:28:38.794 --> 00:28:39.329
Great.
 

00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:46.740
Thank you, Jacob, very much.
 

00:28:46.740 --> 00:29:14.680
 
 

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.780
What I wanted to show you was a
clip that actually my daughter

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.880
brought to my attention just
this past weekend.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.568
She was watching television,
"America Has Talent."

00:29:26.568 --> 00:29:29.759
Does anybody watch this,
"America Has Talent"?

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:31.375
And she said,
"Dad, you've got to watch

00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:31.640
this.
 

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.048
This is the most amazing thing.
 

00:29:33.048 --> 00:29:35.748
They've got these two guys on
here called Nuttin' But

00:29:35.748 --> 00:29:36.730
Strings."
 

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.920
So I did.
 

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:45.579
I--And I went to--She sent me
the link to YouTube here.

00:29:45.579 --> 00:30:35.599
&gt;
 

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:37.848
All right.
 

00:30:37.848 --> 00:30:40.628
So obviously the violin is not
just this stodgy old thing from

00:30:40.628 --> 00:30:41.450
the Renaissance.
 

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.568
It has some legs today,
used in folk music.

00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:47.488
Sometimes you see it in
Nashville playing with country

00:30:47.488 --> 00:30:49.029
music, that kind of thing.
 

00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:52.880
Is this a travesty to use a
violin with hip-hop here?

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.819
I guess this is hip-hop.
 

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:54.690
Of course not.
 

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.009
This is wonderful.
 

00:30:57.009 --> 00:30:58.832
This is the best thing that has
happened to the violin in the

00:30:58.832 --> 00:30:59.470
last hundred years.
 

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.567
There will be millions of kids
out there now that say

00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:03.990
"Gee, I'd like to learn to
play the violin too."

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.694
So this is wonderful,
this sort of cross-semination

00:31:07.694 --> 00:31:10.001
of genres here,
bringing this particular

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.218
instrument,
the traditional classical

00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:14.380
violin, into the popular realm.
 

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:14.902
All right.
 

00:31:14.902 --> 00:31:16.210
So let's put that aside.
 

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.038
We've talked a little bit about
sound production here.

00:31:20.038 --> 00:31:22.942
I've got two pieces I'm going
to work with here for the end of

00:31:22.942 --> 00:31:23.608
our session.
 

00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:29.009
We have 15 minutes left and
here are these two pieces.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:31.788
The first, you can see on the
board up there,

00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:35.009
is by another Russian composer,
Modest Musorgsky.

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:37.451
It's called "Polish
Oxcart" from his work

00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:39.160
Pictures at an
Exhibition.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.730
What happened was he had a
friend.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.690
The friend died.
 

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.568
The friend was an artist.
 

00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:47.184
The friend left these pictures
as an homage to the

00:31:47.184 --> 00:31:48.009
painter.
 

00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:50.694
Mussorgsky sat down and tried
to come up with,

00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:54.036
create a musical response to
each of these paintings that

00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:55.230
were on display.
 

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.698
Now this is a piece that's
always interested me because the

00:31:59.698 --> 00:32:02.009
painting is very pedestrian.
 

00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:05.807
It's of an old Polish oxcart
sitting on some godforsaken road

00:32:05.807 --> 00:32:07.578
in rural Russia somewhere.
 

00:32:07.578 --> 00:32:10.730
So how do you make that work as
music?

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.880
How do you turn that visual
image into music?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.778
How do you turn that into a
sort of live sonic-scape?

00:32:19.778 --> 00:32:21.843
And I should say at the
outset--I'm going to prejudice

00:32:21.843 --> 00:32:23.400
your listening here just a
little bit.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.990
I hear this as me being in the
center and this oxcart

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.890
starting--It could start at
either side.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:30.730
It doesn't matter.
 

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.680
Every written thing usually
moves left to right so I'm going

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.868
to hear this moving left to
right.

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:37.890
It comes in front of me,
almost rolls over top of me,

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.810
runs me down,
and then disappears to my

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.038
right,
so as we listen to this,

00:32:45.038 --> 00:32:50.496
you think about what are the
techniques by which Musorgsky

00:32:50.496 --> 00:32:54.038
creates this musical action
scene.

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.989
You should be able to come up
with two pretty good ideas here,

00:32:55.989 --> 00:32:56.819
two pretty good answers.
 

00:32:56.819 --> 00:32:58.480
All right. Here we go.
 

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:18.368
&gt;
 

00:33:18.368 --> 00:33:25.633
Now the instrument is--that
is--playing is a low tuba,

00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:29.058
a low brass instrument.
 

00:33:29.058 --> 00:33:31.663
It doesn't sound much like a
tuba because it's actually

00:33:31.663 --> 00:33:33.977
playing in the higher register
of the instrument,

00:33:33.977 --> 00:33:34.990
but it is a tuba.
 

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:55.400
&gt;
 

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.598
Okay. Now the strings.
 

00:33:56.598 --> 00:33:59.020
The strings come in with a
counter-idea,

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.450
a complementary idea.
 

00:34:00.450 --> 00:35:58.199
&gt;
 

00:35:58.199 --> 00:35:58.605
Okay.
 

00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:02.007
Give me one pretty
straightforward way this

00:36:02.007 --> 00:36:02.980
happened.
 

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:08.380
What did he do there?
 

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.210
Yes, young lady out here please.
 

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.079
Student: Crescendo?
 

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:12.436
Prof: Okay,
crescendo.

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:13.599
From beginning to end?
 

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.920
Student: Got louder,
then softer.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.224
Prof: Yeah,
so like a giant wedge,

00:36:18.224 --> 00:36:21.280
that's why the cart seems to
move in front of you,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.010
so we're talking about musical
volume here.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.695
It started very quietly,
it built up to this huge center

00:36:28.695 --> 00:36:31.429
in which we had the bass drum
pounding away there and the

00:36:31.429 --> 00:36:34.507
snare drum coming in to give the
effect that the entire earth is

00:36:34.507 --> 00:36:36.510
rattling at that particular
point,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:41.800
and then as it passed by
you--the thunder passed by you--

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.447
and off it went into the
distance, quietly into the

00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:45.030
distance.
 

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:51.820
We'll come back to that,
but how did that happen?

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.639
We'll listen to the end of that
in just one moment.

00:36:53.639 --> 00:37:00.949
It's kind of a disintegration
of the sound at the end.

00:37:00.949 --> 00:37:04.900
So that's one big way this
happened.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.110
That's probably the big-ticket
item here.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.679
There's another way,
a more subtle way.

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:13.969
Any thoughts about that?
 

00:37:13.969 --> 00:37:14.800
Yes?
 

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.639
Student: The
instrumentation?

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:19.780
Prof: Yes,
the instrumentation.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.400
Can you elaborate on that?
 

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.757
Student: Yeah.
 

00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:26.635
It starts with low instruments
and then moves to higher ones,

00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:28.510
and then back to low ones.
 

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.880
Prof: Great. Right.
 

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.673
So there's a kind of wedge
shape with regard to the

00:37:35.673 --> 00:37:37.039
instruments too.
 

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:40.893
He started with the lowest
instruments and then goes to the

00:37:40.893 --> 00:37:45.079
high instruments and then back
to low instruments at the end.

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:48.610
Let's just review--Well,
no, we won't review this.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.579
Let's not review that. Okay?
 

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:55.043
We don't have time to review
that, but let's go on to say the

00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:57.871
following,
that what Musorgsky knew there

00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:00.480
was a very basic principle of
acoustics,

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.239
and what is that principle?
 

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:03.829
Yeah?
 

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:04.400
Student: Doppler
principle..

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.903
Prof: I beg your
pardon?

00:38:04.903 --> 00:38:05.559
Student: Doppler
principle.

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:06.800
Prof: Well,
to some extent.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.201
I'm going to give an example
or--example of that--of the

00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:11.601
train kind of going by you,
and the sound heading off in

00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:12.650
the other direction.
 

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.559
Yes, to some extent it is that,
yes,

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:20.822
but what I was thinking about
here is this idea that the

00:38:20.822 --> 00:38:26.289
lowest sounds create the longest
sound waves,

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:28.389
and they last the longest.
 

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:31.831
The lowest sounds create the
largest sound waves and they

00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:33.000
last the longest.
 

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.650
The lowest sounds last the
longest.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.599
Why might this be the case?
 

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:41.369
If we're not having too much
luck with our slides this

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:45.780
morning, I went ahead and put
this one up on the board here.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.010
Here is one pitch.
 

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.813
Here is the pitch in--of--a
string an octave higher so you

00:38:50.813 --> 00:38:51.510
can see it this way.
 

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.655
As you probably know,
if you take a long string and

00:38:54.655 --> 00:38:57.280
pluck it,
it's going to take that long

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.489
string a long time to pass that
sort of cycle,

00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:02.248
if you will,
just one pass through that

00:39:02.248 --> 00:39:02.619
cycle.
 

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:07.034
The string half a length will
pass through that cycle two

00:39:07.034 --> 00:39:12.159
times so that you can kind of
graph these up here as one long,

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:16.885
low sound or one faster
vibrating sound an octave

00:39:16.885 --> 00:39:20.994
higher,
so again low sounds or low

00:39:20.994 --> 00:39:24.360
frequencies travel farther.
 

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.619
Now you've experienced this in
your own life.

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:28.699
You're standing on a street
corner here in New Haven.

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.510
In the distance what do you
hear?

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.960
An automobile approaching with
a souped-up audio system in it,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.389
and what sound do you hear at
the very first?

00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:42.579
&gt;
 

00:39:42.579 --> 00:39:43.518
That kind of thing.
 

00:39:43.518 --> 00:39:48.170
Then maybe &lt;&lt;d- d- d- d-
d&gt;&gt;

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.699
and then maybe some kind of
melody will come in and then

00:39:50.699 --> 00:39:53.550
it'll all come together right in
front of you and it'll kind of

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.929
disappear in the distance.
 

00:39:54.929 --> 00:39:55.829
You're at a football game.
 

00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:57.360
You've probably experienced
this too.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.039
The band is marching on the
field.

00:40:01.039 --> 00:40:03.949
Suddenly they do the Doppler
effect where they turn their

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:06.182
backs to you,
in a way, and they're marching

00:40:06.182 --> 00:40:08.730
away from you and you hear very
little sound.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.409
What instrumental sound do you
hear?

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.980
&gt;
 

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.592
The bass drum and the tuba or
in the marching band it would be

00:40:18.592 --> 00:40:22.030
a sousaphone they would call it,
the bass drum and tuba.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.949
So Musorgsky knew this law of
acoustics because he was a

00:40:24.949 --> 00:40:28.186
professional musician and was
playing off of it to create this

00:40:28.186 --> 00:40:31.320
rather unusual and remarkable
musical sound-scape here.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.159
Okay. I have five minutes left.
 

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:34.570
I'd like to do one last piece.
 

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.500
It's another piece by Richard
Strauss.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.750
It kind of brings us to the end
of Richard Strauss,

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.369
our discussion of Richard
Strauss.

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:43.869
We'll say good-bye to him here
in our course.

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:48.043
It's called Death and
Transfiguration,

00:40:48.043 --> 00:40:53.827
and I hear this as a companion
piece, a kind of pendant to the

00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:56.010
Zarathustra.
 

00:40:56.010 --> 00:41:00.893
One sort of opens up the
beginning of life here and the

00:41:00.893 --> 00:41:05.780
other closes it down through a
referencing of death.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.300
There's an interesting anecdote
about Strauss,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.789
and that is that on his
deathbed he said to his

00:41:11.789 --> 00:41:14.889
daughter,
Alice--He said, "Alice,

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.099
it's the funniest thing.
 

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:21.047
Dying is exactly as I composed
it in Death and

00:41:21.047 --> 00:41:23.349
Transfiguration."
 

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:25.871
What an odd thing to say,
but in any event

00:41:25.871 --> 00:41:27.469
&gt;
 

00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:29.889
here is how this works.
 

00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:31.759
We've been talking about this
overtone series with

00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:32.559
Zarathustra.
 

00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:34.210
Eva played this overtone series.
 

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.989
He's basically working up to
the upper partials.

00:41:36.989 --> 00:41:40.670
Now he's going to work down the
partials.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.052
He's going to close it back
down here with death and he's

00:41:44.052 --> 00:41:47.074
going to close it back down
using a process that we

00:41:47.074 --> 00:41:51.041
frequently encounter in music,
and that is this idea of

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:53.820
dissonance resolving to
consonance.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.460
Here is a dissonance.
 

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.650
&gt;
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.094
Here is a consonance.
 

00:41:59.094 --> 00:42:01.090
&gt;
 

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.195
There are precise technical
reasons why these are the way

00:42:05.195 --> 00:42:09.010
they are, but let me try to cut
to the chase here.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.657
With dissonant intervals they
tend to be frequencies that are

00:42:11.657 --> 00:42:13.733
sounding right next to each
other, very close-by

00:42:13.733 --> 00:42:14.440
frequencies.
 

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.739
They sound dissonant.
 

00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:18.159
If you allow a little bit of
spacing,

00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:20.820
a little more space between
your frequencies,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.460
they're a little bit farther
apart,

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.242
then you can move from
closeness &lt;&lt;plays

00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:24.757
chord&gt;&gt;
 

00:42:24.757 --> 00:42:25.945
to &gt;
 

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:27.489
spacing and you get the
consonance.

00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:30.438
Generally speaking,
dissonant intervals have ratios

00:42:30.438 --> 00:42:33.681
such as nine to eight for the
whole step or seventeen to

00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:35.449
sixteen for the half step.
 

00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:39.922
They're irrational numbers and
these irrational numbers like to

00:42:39.922 --> 00:42:43.773
move to rational numbers;
they like to move to

00:42:43.773 --> 00:42:46.009
consonances;
they like to move to intervals

00:42:46.009 --> 00:42:48.074
that are based on things such as
two to one and three to two or

00:42:48.074 --> 00:42:48.840
maybe four to three.
 

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.791
So that's the principle of this
idea of dissonance resolving to

00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:56.039
consonance.
 

00:42:56.039 --> 00:42:58.605
So we're going to listen now to
the end of Strauss's Death

00:42:58.605 --> 00:43:03.521
and Transfiguration,
and again we've got the idea of

00:43:03.521 --> 00:43:07.030
the octave,
then the fifth, then the fourth.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.541
We're working up farther and
farther in these partials and

00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:14.052
we've got some of these notes
right next to each other and

00:43:14.052 --> 00:43:17.563
they want to move to the stable
notes so we're going to be

00:43:17.563 --> 00:43:21.257
hearing a lot of a note right
above the tonic wanting to pull

00:43:21.257 --> 00:43:23.230
down to that tonic note.
 

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.577
We're going to hear a lot of
the note right above the

00:43:26.577 --> 00:43:29.670
dominant wanting to pull down to
the dominant.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.849
So let's listen to this.
 

00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:32.360
We have about three minutes I
think.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.739
We'll hear it and I'll comment
a bit as we go.

00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:39.619
&gt;
 

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:40.242
Okay.
 

00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:45.849
First question:
What string technique is being

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:47.469
used here?
 

00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:49.269
Tremolo.
 

00:43:49.269 --> 00:43:50.960
Just sawing away there.
 

00:43:50.960 --> 00:44:44.550
&gt;
 

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.404
Now just working with the
four-note motive here--

00:44:49.404 --> 00:44:52.539
&gt;
 

00:44:52.539 --> 00:44:52.951
Whoah.
 

00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:56.380
A strange little dissonant
chord there resolving to

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.340
consonance.
 

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:31.849
&gt;
 

00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:56.840
&gt;
 

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:05.269
And here it's all just tonic,
just the basic primordial note

00:46:05.269 --> 00:46:11.699
upon which all these other tones
are built.

00:46:11.699 --> 00:46:26.579
&gt;
 

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:26.864
Okay.
 

00:46:26.864 --> 00:46:29.610
So that's Richard Strauss's
approach to death,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.644
not particularly relevant to
you young people but for older

00:46:32.644 --> 00:46:35.628
gentlemen such as Professor
Kagan and myself we're getting

00:46:35.628 --> 00:46:36.570
close to that.
 

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:37.275
Right, Don?
 

00:46:37.275 --> 00:46:38.750
&gt;
 

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.000
So thank you all for staying
with this this morning.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.289
I hope you enjoyed that music.
 

00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:46.460
We'll see you in section
starting this Thursday.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.233
If you have any questions,
come up and see me or send me

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:49.840
an e-mail.
 

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:56.000

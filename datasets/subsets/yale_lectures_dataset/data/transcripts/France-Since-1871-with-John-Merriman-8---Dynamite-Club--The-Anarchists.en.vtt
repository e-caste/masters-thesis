00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.926
Professor John
Merriman: I'm going to talk

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:06.373
about anarchism today,
and especially I'm going to

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.670
talk about the life and death of
one guy,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570
somebody I don't admire,
Émile Henry;

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.148
but, in a way he represents
some aspects of the origin of

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:20.400
modern terrorism in late
nineteenth-century Paris.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.972
And, I guess if you're going to
write a book about somebody it's

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.177
not a bad idea to pick someone
who only lived to be age

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:27.698
twenty-one,
because it makes for a shorter

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:31.611
book;
because he was guillotined,

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.750
as you'll see,
in 1894.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.007
So, there we go.
First of all,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.690
anarchists, unlike socialists,
did not want to capture the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.730
State, seize control of the
State.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.382
They wanted to destroy the
State, they wanted to abolish

00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:53.731
the State.
They viewed political

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.796
participation--and in this way
they were rather like the

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:02.229
syndicalists--as for propping up
capitalism and its army,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.060
defending the interests of
wealthy people.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.906
The first anarchist was a man
called Proudhon,

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:15.400
whose influence really is in
the 1850s and 1860s.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.144
And Proudhon is from the east
of France, he was from

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:21.420
Besançon,
in the east.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.120
And he once wrote a pamphlet
called "Property is Theft," in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.658
1841--he meant too much property
or unearned property was

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:34.709
theft--but it was a provocative
kind of title,

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.399
and he once wrote the
following: "To be governed is to

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.845
be watched, inspected,
spied upon, directed,

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:45.312
law-driven, numbered,
regulated, enrolled,

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:47.503
indoctrinated,
preached at,

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:49.891
controlled, checked,
estimated, valued,

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:53.158
censored, commanded by
creatures who have neither the

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:55.016
right,
nor the wisdom,

00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:58.715
nor the virtue to do so.
To be governed is to be at

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:01.212
every operation,
at every transaction,

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:03.636
noted, registered,
counted, taxed,

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:06.119
stamped, measured,
numbered, assessed,

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.079
licensed, authorized,
admonished, prevented,

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.531
forbidden, reformed,
corrected, punished,

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.088
and on the pretext of public
utility and in the name of the

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:18.400
general interest to be placed
under contribution,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.560
drilled, fleeced,
exploited, monopolized,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.010
extorted from,
squeezed, hoaxed,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.164
robbed;
and then, at the slightest

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:29.129
resistance, the first word of
complaint could be repressed,

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.503
fired upon, vilified,
harassed, hunted down,

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:35.250
abused, clubbed,
disarmed, bound,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.430
checked, imprisoned,
judged, condemned,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.949
shot, deported,
sacrificed, sold,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.798
betrayed and,
to crown all,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.506
mocked, ridiculed,
derided, outraged,

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:51.167
dishonored.
That is government,

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:54.889
that is its justice,
that is its morality."

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.462
Now, Proudhon was followed by
two important Russian

00:02:58.462 --> 00:03:01.750
anarchists, both of whom I won't
talk about,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.718
but who are extremely
interesting, and both of whom

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:08.281
were nobles, one the guy called
Peter Kropotkin and the other

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.820
the terrifying,
quite terrifying Mikhail

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.039
Bakunin, and they become quite
important.

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:21.279
Kropotkin, who was a gentleman
geographer and once toasted by

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.638
the King of England,
and in the end was horrified by

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:29.965
the Bolshevik Revolution,
he was among those who came up

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:33.270
with the term "propaganda by the
deed";

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.001
that is, the belief that the
masses were potentially

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.220
revolutionary,
and it took a single spark,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.726
a single assassination,
a single bomb to start

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:48.405
revolution rolling.
Anarchists assassinated,

00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:51.228
depending on how you count it,
five, or six,

00:03:51.228 --> 00:03:55.166
or seven heads of state in the
late decades of the nineteenth

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.198
century,
including President McKinley of

00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:01.289
the United States,
who was shot or stabbed,

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:07.930
I can't remember which,
in Buffalo, New York in 1901.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.423
That number included,
as we'll see in awhile,

00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:14.873
Sadi Carnot,
c-a-r-n-o-t,

00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:18.550
who was the president of
France.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.611
So, I want to begin with a bomb.
And I've had,

00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:26.775
because of this bomb,
years and years afterward--I've

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:30.061
had the rather odd feeling of
twice having eaten in the

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:33.529
café restaurant that my
book subject blew up,

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.561
the Café
Terminus--and it is the turning

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:41.329
point in the origins of modern
terrorism.

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:46.518
On February 12th,^( )1894,
a pale, thin young man called

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:51.990
Émile Henry prepared a
bomb in his room in Paris.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.470
He hid it in his clothing along
with a loaded pistol and a

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.012
knife, and he headed toward the
elegant boulevards near the

00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:02.004
Paris Opera,
which had been completed twenty

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:05.179
years earlier.
He wanted to throw the bomb and

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.620
kill as many people as possible.
Henry stopped before the Opera

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.649
itself, which,
as you can see,

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.519
resembles a giant gilded
wedding cake.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.898
There was a fancy ball going
on, and he knew he could not get

00:05:17.898 --> 00:05:21.220
past the guards to get close
enough to claim any victims.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.310
He then checked out the
Restaurant Bignon,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.300
followed by the Café
American,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.281
and then the most chic of them
all, the Café

00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:31.759
de la Paix in the Grand Hotel,
which is still there.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.238
He was in some way a
flâneur,

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:37.985
an intellectual who had briefly
in his life been something of a

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:39.613
dandy,
but if so he was an

00:05:39.613 --> 00:05:41.875
impoverished
flâneur who lived

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.945
on the margins of urban life and
who now came to the Grand

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:48.069
Boulevard not just to observe
with detached distance,

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.058
as the flâneur
did, but to hate,

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:54.828
and now to kill.
He moved on,

00:05:54.828 --> 00:05:58.910
finding each place was not
crowded enough.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.832
At eight p.m.
he reached the Café

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:05.004
Terminus, right next to the
Gare Saint-Lazare,

00:06:05.004 --> 00:06:08.670
around the corner from the Gare
Saint-Lazare and,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.131
as the café
was slowly filling up,

00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:13.470
he ordered a beer,
and soon another,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.449
and then a cigar,
and in a rather

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.639
un-anarchist-like gesture he
paid for them,

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.060
as the small orchestra played
on.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.920
About an hour later he walked
to the doorway,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.259
turned, lit the fuse with a
cigar.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.539
He threw the bomb back into the
café, which was now very

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.735
crowded.
Already famous for its great

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:38.369
expositions, Paris,
more than ever identified with

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:41.426
leisure and with consumerism,
had become a permanent

00:06:41.426 --> 00:06:44.282
exposition in itself,
its boulevards the staging

00:06:44.282 --> 00:06:46.318
ground,
as you shall see later in the

00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:48.139
course, for the Belle
Époque.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.263
Department stores welcomed
clients with dazzling electric

00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:54.832
lights and arranged shop windows
inspiring Zola to call them 'the

00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:58.274
cathedrals of modernity."
The aisles of the department

00:06:58.274 --> 00:07:02.120
stores were, as has been argued,
a continuation of the great

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.492
boulevards themselves.
In contrast,

00:07:04.492 --> 00:07:08.083
the poor workers lived along
the narrow grey streets of the

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:10.621
quartiers
populaires--this is not a

00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:14.514
quartier populaire,
this is the Terminus--the

00:07:14.514 --> 00:07:17.594
plebeian neighborhoods of
eastern Paris,

00:07:17.594 --> 00:07:21.069
where cholera had killed as
late as 1884.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.040
The rebuilding of Paris by
Haussmann in the fifties and

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.790
sixties had chased thousands of
ordinary people,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.448
by higher rents,
to the exterior neighborhoods

00:07:30.448 --> 00:07:33.699
of northern Paris,
northeastern Paris,

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.790
and to the working class
suburbs.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.624
But the capital of the world,
that is, Paris,

00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:42.329
was no longer the capital of
revolution.

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.832
Soldiers in Paris seemed to
be--police and soldiers seemed

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.782
to be everywhere,
and there were indeed many more

00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:50.449
of them.
For that matter,

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.529
Haussmann's boulevards were too
wide for barricades.

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:57.257
To Auguste Renoir,
the Impressionist painting,

00:07:57.257 --> 00:08:01.149
the buildings that lined the
boulevards were,

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.766
"cold and lined up like
soldiers at review," a nice

00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:08.310
description of the consolidation
of State power in

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.596
nineteenth-century France.
On May Day 1891,

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:15.714
troops fired on demonstrators,
killing women and children in

00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:19.204
the small industrial town in the
north of Fourmies,

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:22.325
a woolens town.
France may not then have had

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:25.282
strong executive authority
because of the fear of

00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:28.732
Caesarism, after two Napoleons,
but no other state was so

00:08:28.732 --> 00:08:32.970
centralized.
And, so, in the early 1890s did

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.909
anarchists begin to create small
organizations,

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.186
along La Mouffe,
which is the Rue Mouffetard,

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:44.977
between the Pantheon where a
guy called Jean Grave published

00:08:44.977 --> 00:08:48.190
one of the anarchist newspapers
at number 140,

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.104
here and there in the Latin
Quarter, but above all in

00:08:52.104 --> 00:08:56.170
Montmartre and in these northern
industrial regions,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.827
and beyond in suburbs.
Now, the 1880s and '90s will,

00:09:01.827 --> 00:09:05.692
as you may already know,
will be remembered as a time of

00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:10.399
scandal--the sleazy Panama Canal
scandal and lots of other ones;

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.639
the president's son-in-law
selling the Légion

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:16.939
d'Honneur, et cetera.
And the memory of the Paris

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:19.460
Commune loomed large for
anarchists.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.754
More than 25,000 people had
been gunned down,

00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:23.840
and now from the heights of
Montmartr,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.619
e and from Belleville,
another peripheral

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:29.537
neighborhood,
anarchists looked down on the

00:09:29.537 --> 00:09:33.539
flashing lights of the capital,
and they hate it.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:37.836
Many admired the Russian
anarchist Michael Bakunin for

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:42.863
whom destruction was "a creative
passion that would bring about

00:09:42.863 --> 00:09:47.345
the end of the State,
capitalism, and private

00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:49.877
property."
"The modern state," Bakunin

00:09:49.877 --> 00:09:52.943
wrote, "with all its terrible
means of action given to them by

00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:56.427
modern centralization,
was becoming an immense,

00:09:56.427 --> 00:10:02.182
crushing, threatening reality,"
as those slaughtered communards

00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:07.378
saw up close in May of 1871.
And, so, a wave of anarchist

00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:11.519
bombings swept the capital
between 1892 and 1894.

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:16.128
They ended with the
assassination of Sadi Carnot in

00:10:16.128 --> 00:10:21.184
June of that year in Lyon.
After two attempts on his life,

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:25.574
King Humberto I of Italy noted
that assassination was "a

00:10:25.574 --> 00:10:28.241
professional risk,"
and, indeed,

00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:30.899
he was later assassinated
himself.

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.318
Yet, many of the anarchists
were people of peace,

00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:40.382
indeed, and women of peace in
the case of Louise Michel,

00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:45.034
about whom you can read.
For Kropotkin and before him

00:10:45.034 --> 00:10:49.256
Proudhon, the goal was the
primitive, the goal was sort of

00:10:49.256 --> 00:10:52.960
communities that would exist
without the state.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.608
Kropotkin had lived in the
French Jura mountains,

00:10:55.608 --> 00:10:57.759
in the east,
and also in Switzerland,

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:02.785
and their watchmakers seemed to
get along fine without the

00:11:02.785 --> 00:11:06.745
intrusion of the state.
But yet, as I said before,

00:11:06.745 --> 00:11:11.000
it was Kropotkin who accepted
and may have created the phrase,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.964
"propaganda by the deed,"
sometimes attributed to the

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:22.170
Italian anarchist Malatesta who
had lots of influence in Spain,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.228
in Italy and in Argentina;
who doesn't look like such a

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:29.090
terrifying guy himself,
when you see him there,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.470
but again the belief that a
single act of violence would be

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.210
the spark that would bring
social revolution.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.237
Now, Kropotkin later had doubts
about this, and he said,

00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:40.330
"personally I hate these
explosions,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.051
but I cannot stand as a judge
to condemn those who are driven

00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:46.214
to despair."
He had, after all,

00:11:46.214 --> 00:11:49.953
in 1880, described the
importance of permanent revolt

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:53.116
by oral and written propaganda,
by the knife,

00:11:53.116 --> 00:11:58.011
the rifle and dynamite.
"Everything that is not legal

00:11:58.011 --> 00:12:02.986
is good for us."
Now, dynamite was invented by

00:12:02.986 --> 00:12:07.633
that man of the Peace Prize,
Alfred Nobel,

00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:11.130
in 1868.
And what it seemed to do was

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.161
level the playing field.
It seemed to represent a modern

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.553
revolutionary alchemy,
and as a compensation for many

00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:21.196
evils,
for humiliation and weakness,

00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:24.742
for discrimination and
frustration, anger at social

00:12:24.742 --> 00:12:28.152
exploitation and injustice.
The German anarchist,

00:12:28.152 --> 00:12:30.657
Johan Most, who came to the
United States,

00:12:30.657 --> 00:12:34.139
he had written in his newspaper
Freedom that it was

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.559
within the power of dynamite to
destroy capitalism,

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:41.200
just as it had been within the
power of gunpowder and the rifle

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.960
to wipe feudalism from the face
of the earth.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.183
And American anarchists crowed,
before being hung in Chicago,

00:12:49.183 --> 00:12:53.134
Haymarket, 1886,
"in giving dynamite to the

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:58.269
downtrodden millions of the
globe, science has truly done

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:02.143
its best work."
The famous Ravachol,

00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:07.480
Francois Claudius Ravachol,
took this to heart.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.856
He had been born in gnawing
poverty near Saint-Etienne in

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:14.414
'59, his father a Dutch mill
hand who abandoned his wife and

00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:17.286
four children.
In primary school and at Mass

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:20.674
he was embarrassed by having
clothes so shabby that they

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:24.267
resembled those worn by beggars.
He worked here and there,

00:13:24.267 --> 00:13:26.740
but periods of unemployment
became longer.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.346
He turned toward anarchism,
also to grave robbing,

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:33.070
counterfeiting,
and finally murder,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:38.112
strangling a strange old hermit
who had a lot of money stashed

00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:42.470
away in his house in the hills,
near Saint-Etienne.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.299
He was arrested,
managed to escape the police

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:48.899
wagon, and went to Paris living
under an assumed name.

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:53.026
In 1891 police fired on
demonstrators on the Boulevard

00:13:53.026 --> 00:13:56.139
Clichy in Paris,
on the edge of Paris.

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:59.722
Three were hauled to the Police
Station and they were beaten up,

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:03.020
put on trial and two condemned
to long prison sentences.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.770
Ravachol's two deeds followed.
He bombed the houses of two of

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.220
the magistrates on the Boulevard
Saint-Germain,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.435
a very elegant neighborhood,
and on the Rue du Clichy,

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.969
voilà.
On the way home he stopped in a

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:19.878
restaurant called Le
Véry, v-e-r-y,

00:14:19.878 --> 00:14:23.000
with an accent,
on the Boulevard Magenta.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.580
A waiter remembered a scar he
had on his left hand.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.732
Three days later he went back
to the same place to eat,

00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:33.876
because he'd eaten well.
It took ten policemen to subdue

00:14:33.876 --> 00:14:36.949
him.
"See this hand," he told judge

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:41.630
and jurors, "it has killed as
many bourgeois as it has

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.535
fingers."
He was guillotined on the 11th

00:14:45.535 --> 00:14:49.519
of July 1892 in the Loire,
in Montbrison.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:53.497
Several days later a bomb
destroyed the restaurant,

00:14:53.497 --> 00:14:56.440
Le Véry,
killing the patron,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.075
the owner, leading to the
ghoulish pun that served as an

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:04.000
anarchist signature,
vérification.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.276
Ravachol so terrified
contemporaries that for a time

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:12.183
his name became a French verb;
to ravacholiser

00:15:12.183 --> 00:15:15.379
quelqu'un,
somebody, was to dynamite them.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:18.914
And after his death the
anarchists of Paris and their

00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:22.336
exiled friends in London,
from all over the continent,

00:15:22.336 --> 00:15:25.509
debated long into the night the
wisdom of such attacks.

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:28.889
A wood print--here you can see
it--by the artist Charlotte

00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:32.269
Morin, reproduced in a widely
read anarchist newspaper,

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.038
portrayed Ravachol as a martyr,
his defiant,

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:38.450
heroic face set within the
frame of the guillotine.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.775
Some sympathizers began to
compare their martyr,

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:45.029
Ravachol, to sort of a violent
Jesus Christ.

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:50.212
Both Christ and Ravachol were
thirty-three when they were

00:15:50.212 --> 00:15:52.972
executed.
And anarchists sang a song

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:56.860
called La Ravachol,
that is, The Song of Ravachol,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.735
to the tune of Ça
Ira, a song from the French

00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:04.477
Revolution: "In the great city
of Paris live the well-fed

00:16:04.477 --> 00:16:08.220
bourgeois and the destitute who
have empty stomachs,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.504
but they have long teeth.
Long live Ravachol,

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:15.737
let's dance the Ravachol;
long live the sound of

00:16:15.737 --> 00:16:18.318
explosions.
So it will be,

00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:22.250
so it will be,
ça ira."

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.682
In his eulogy for Ravachol,
an anarchist critic,

00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:28.750
art critic, and literary
critic, Paul Adam,

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.840
warned that the murder of
Ravachol will open an era;

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.160
and it did.
An anarchist writer outraged

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.747
public opinion by provocatively
stating, "what do the victims

00:16:40.747 --> 00:16:44.493
matter if the gesture is
beautiful?"-- the beau

00:16:44.493 --> 00:16:47.703
geste.
A veritable psychosis took hold

00:16:47.703 --> 00:16:51.763
of Paris with people of means
afraid to go to good restaurants

00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:55.556
or the theater and in nice
neighborhoods people fearing to

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:59.550
rent to magistrates for fear of
les dynamiteurs,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.056
the dynamiters.
Nearly twenty Parisian dailies

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.900
carried each installment of
anarchist attack-- this is a

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.994
bomb,
this is called a marmite,

00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:14.759
it's a pan, it's a casserole,
but it's a bomb.

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:17.890
Hundreds of scrawled--and
here's the first,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.660
they invented at this time the
wagons that'd come to detonate,

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.021
and to make safe as best they
can these objects,

00:17:26.021 --> 00:17:29.670
and they kept finding joke
bombs in sardine cans,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.941
and stuff like that.
And, so, here's the municipal

00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:36.700
chemist, a guy called Girard,
who's checking this out.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.797
Hundreds of scrawled threats,
which I read,

00:17:39.797 --> 00:17:44.222
they're in the Archives there,
arrived to property owners and

00:17:44.222 --> 00:17:47.712
to concierges,
to people of means,

00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:51.809
signed by the Avengers of
Ravachol;

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.203
or an anarchist from the
neighborhood addressed to an

00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:58.923
exploiter of the proletarian,
"finally the day when social

00:17:58.923 --> 00:18:01.210
justice will arrive;
next Sunday,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.490
the First of May,
you'll be blown up;

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.891
signed, La Dynamite."
And in Montmartre,

00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:11.188
a benefit dance for anarchists
played the dynamite polka,

00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:15.910
as one of the dances.
The well-known next act.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.986
On the ninth of December,
1893, Auguste Vaillant,

00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:22.704
an unemployed worker distraught
at being unable to feed his

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:25.587
family,
tossed a small bomb filled with

00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:29.099
tacks, thumb tacks,
into the Chamber of Deputies.

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:32.256
His goal was not to kill--there
were several scratches on the

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:35.517
deputies--but to call attention
to the plight of the poor whose

00:18:35.517 --> 00:18:38.200
situation seemed to be getting
worse and worse.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.139
He was captured on the spot.
The guillotine immediately,

00:18:42.139 --> 00:18:44.951
instantaneously,
after a brief trial,

00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:48.309
severed his head as he
defiantly shouted the

00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:53.283
obligatory, "long live anarchy."
Émile Henry's father,

00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:56.184
a militant republican,
who wrote poetry,

00:18:56.184 --> 00:19:01.019
had been elected to the Commune
from the tenth arrondissement,

00:19:01.019 --> 00:19:03.960
and was a member of the Central
Committee of the Federated

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.920
National Guard in the Paris
Commune.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.589
He fled under a sentence of
death to Spain.

00:19:10.589 --> 00:19:15.263
And in Catalonia he worked in
the mines, turning from

00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:18.769
socialism to anarchism;
because the anarchists were

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:21.613
terribly influential in Spain,
right through the Spanish Civil

00:19:21.613 --> 00:19:24.124
War,
particularly in Barcelona and

00:19:24.124 --> 00:19:26.609
also in Andalusia,
in the south.

00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:31.244
Émile was born in 1872
in a suburb of Barcelona,

00:19:31.244 --> 00:19:34.420
dominated by the textile
factories.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.146
He had two brothers,
Fortuné,

00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:40.418
who was older,
who had the same name as his

00:19:40.418 --> 00:19:44.079
father, and Jules,
who was fifteen in 1894.

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:48.321
Following his father's death in
1882, from what appeared to be

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:51.658
mercury poisoning,
Madame Henry returned to Paris

00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:54.440
with her children,
or to the region.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.756
Émile became a pupil of
the City of Paris,

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:04.151
receiving the equivalent of a
scholarship to a school outside

00:20:04.151 --> 00:20:07.336
of Paris.
His mother bought or had a

00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:12.298
little bit of land that had been
in the family and found--started

00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:15.552
up an auberge,
right down the street from

00:20:15.552 --> 00:20:18.371
this, it was actually an inn.
I was actually able to find it,

00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:20.170
to go out to this place called
Brévon,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.534
which now, sort of strangely
enough, is not all that far from

00:20:24.534 --> 00:20:28.390
Euro Disney, but then was truly
in the countryside.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.759
So, Émile Henry becomes
a scholarship student.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:35.711
He's very smart,
he gets certificates of merit

00:20:35.711 --> 00:20:39.449
in all the schools he goes to,
and he gets his bac,

00:20:39.449 --> 00:20:43.213
his baccalaureate exam;
he passes it at age sixteen,

00:20:43.213 --> 00:20:47.637
which was pretty tough to do.
He was examined in physics,

00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:51.619
math and chemistry,
and he would put some of the

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:54.500
latter to use,
as we shall see.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.376
The last report on his
scholarship read,

00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:58.973
"he will begin studies next
year at the école

00:20:58.973 --> 00:21:01.458
polytechnique,"
which is one of the grands

00:21:01.458 --> 00:21:03.644
écoles,
the big military engineering

00:21:03.644 --> 00:21:05.690
school,
extraordinarily hard to get in.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.644
He was classified as
admissible,

00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:11.113
that is, he could be admitted.
But after passing one part of

00:21:11.113 --> 00:21:14.824
the exam he failed the oral
exam, but he could have taken it

00:21:14.824 --> 00:21:16.811
again.
He claimed that one of his

00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:20.202
friends threw a stink bomb into
the room when he was taking the

00:21:20.202 --> 00:21:22.600
exam.
And it was said later that he

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.250
vowed vengeance on bourgeois
society, blah-blah-blah.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.064
That wasn't the case.
He took a position with an

00:21:29.064 --> 00:21:32.586
uncle, an engineer working on a
water project in Venice,

00:21:32.586 --> 00:21:35.339
but he precipitously returned
to France.

00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:38.904
He dabbled in spiritism,
trying to contact the soul of

00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:42.804
his dead father--that's where
you try to move tables around

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:45.440
and all of that.
His anarchist friend Charles

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.342
Malato claimed that he lost his
footing, and fell into the abyss

00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:50.944
of spiritism,
even becoming a medium of

00:21:50.944 --> 00:21:54.823
incarnation, and wasted his
health in such exhausting

00:21:54.823 --> 00:21:58.329
experiments because he longed
for knowledge.

00:21:58.329 --> 00:22:02.647
But he left it all behind and,
in Paris, he worked here and

00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:06.369
there while living on the
margins of urban life.

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:08.533
His brother,
Fortuné,

00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:13.420
became an anarchist and was a
prominent orator at the meetings

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.388
and debates held in smoky halls
and cafés on the edge of

00:22:18.388 --> 00:22:21.133
Paris,
principally Montmartre,

00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:25.319
and the Faubourg du Temple,
and in the Latin Quarter,

00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:29.829
and he went to jail in 1894 for
things that he'd written.

00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:32.948
Émile,
now twenty years of age--et

00:22:32.948 --> 00:22:35.849
vous voilà,
pas mal,

00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:39.611
parmi vous--he was
called microbe by his

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:43.160
classmates because of his
relatively small size.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.082
He was pale,
deep-set black eyes,

00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:48.566
as you saw, and sported the
beginnings of a blonde beard on

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:50.910
his chin, to go with chestnut
hair.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.040
He was devoted to his mother
and would walk,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.034
or take the train out to not a
really nearby station,

00:23:00.034 --> 00:23:03.698
to go and visit her.
And there was a bar,

00:23:03.698 --> 00:23:06.483
several tables with workers
drinking wine,

00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:09.200
the inevitable checkered
tablecloths,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.512
green shutters and a red brick
roof, and chickens poking around

00:23:14.512 --> 00:23:20.339
and laundry hanging out to dry.
As I said, it was a village.

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:25.531
And of the 120 francs that
Émile Henry earned a

00:23:25.531 --> 00:23:29.940
month, he gave about a third to
his mother.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.918
Here she is down below,
and there she is up above,

00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:39.706
on the left--prematurely aged.
And that is one of the places

00:23:39.706 --> 00:23:42.886
that he lived that we'll see
later, and where I--I've been to

00:23:42.886 --> 00:23:45.422
everywhere that he lived.
I've managed to get into the

00:23:45.422 --> 00:23:46.700
buildings of everywhere he
lived;

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.279
sort of, you kind of walk
around and follow him.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:51.983
I don't admire him,
but it's interesting to try to

00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:54.466
see what he saw,
and that's what I really love

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:57.437
about history.
Anyway, so he began meeting

00:23:57.437 --> 00:24:00.000
with some of the anarchist
groups.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.909
He read Kropotkin's great book,
The Conquest of Bread,

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:08.079
as well as works by Malatesta
and various French counterparts.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:11.372
His two targets were private
property and authority,

00:24:11.372 --> 00:24:14.019
"two vicious germs," as he
called them,

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:16.720
that formed the base of
contemporary societies that,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.520
he wrote, "have to be
destroyed,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.178
eradicated from social life."
He remained an intellectual,

00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:25.907
somewhat detached,
arguably, from those people who

00:24:25.907 --> 00:24:28.190
crowded into these anarchist
meetings,

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.241
or who came to get,
for once, a bite to eat in the

00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:37.450
various lectures where soup was
served to the poor afterward.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.005
In contrast to Vaillant,
who loved the people--Vaillant

00:24:41.005 --> 00:24:44.559
was the guy executed for
throwing the tack bomb--Malato

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.720
remembered Émile only
loved the idea;

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.682
he felt a marked estrangement
from the ignorant and servile

00:24:51.682 --> 00:24:54.945
plebs, plebeians,
a feeling distinctive,

00:24:54.945 --> 00:24:59.859
also, of a number of literary
and artistic anarchists,

00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:06.550
by whom he met no less a
painter than Camille Pissarro,

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.202
who was an anarchist.
And Montmartre also was the

00:25:11.202 --> 00:25:14.940
center of this sort of literary
and cultural anarchism,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.807
the anarchism of this sort of
the intellectual elite who lived

00:25:18.807 --> 00:25:21.279
in Montmartre because it was
cheaper,

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:23.848
and they're the next generation
removed down to

00:25:23.848 --> 00:25:26.808
Montparnasse--and then
Montmartre would already become

00:25:26.808 --> 00:25:29.210
the sort of the tourist trap it
is now,

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:35.279
though it still has its charms.
Émile Henry was a loner.

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:38.611
He never spoke in public,
as far as we know,

00:25:38.611 --> 00:25:42.950
though he did shout out some
things at a meeting once.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.780
He was described later,
after his death,

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.787
as the Saint-Just of anarchy.
Saint-Just was one of the--was

00:25:49.787 --> 00:25:53.067
a cold, steely guy who had
ripped off his mother's silver

00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:55.410
during--before the French
Revolution,

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.031
who became a member of the
Committee of Public Safety,

00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:02.721
and he and Robespierre were the
sort of main men of the

00:26:02.721 --> 00:26:06.150
Committee of Public Safety.
So, he didn't speak like

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.769
Fortuné,
who was a really gifted orator.

00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:11.387
And in March 1893,
Fortuné

00:26:11.387 --> 00:26:16.212
gave a speech at this one place
where they met over and over

00:26:16.212 --> 00:26:19.128
again,
denouncing the government class

00:26:19.128 --> 00:26:22.173
and the bourgeoisie,
and he appeared to pull a

00:26:22.173 --> 00:26:24.609
dynamite cartridge from--he
said,

00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:27.528
"this is our arms,
these are our arms," and he

00:26:27.528 --> 00:26:31.160
appeared to pull a dynamite
cartridge from his pocket.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.106
It actually was nothing but a
pen, or a pen case,

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:38.970
but he was arrested,
and so was Émile.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:44.764
And Émile lost his job,
at that point he worked in the

00:26:44.764 --> 00:26:48.326
garment industry.
I love this because here's the

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:51.952
Rue du Sentier in the center of
Paris and that's still--the sign

00:26:51.952 --> 00:26:55.289
is so beautiful from the 1890s
that they left it there;

00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:57.190
that company hasn't been there
since World War I.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.567
But that's where Émile
worked, but he lost his job

00:27:01.567 --> 00:27:04.849
after he was arrested and then
released.

00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:09.776
He bounced between bad jobs,
once working as an apprentice

00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:14.529
and unpaid watchmaker in order
to perhaps work on timing

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:18.597
mechanisms for bombs.
In 1892--and he always got very

00:27:18.597 --> 00:27:21.859
good--employers loved him
because he was very smart.

00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:25.163
He served as an accountant,
he penned letters and that kind

00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:27.797
of stuff.
But in 1892 he briefly served

00:27:27.797 --> 00:27:31.121
as the manager for the
Anarchist Literary,

00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:33.631
a newspaper.
In the meantime he was

00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:37.109
gathering materials to make
bombs and learning how to

00:27:37.109 --> 00:27:40.216
prepare them.
That July he and his brother

00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:44.071
may have gone to Saint-Etienne
and Montbrison with the

00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:47.926
intention of blowing up the
house of the magistrate in

00:27:47.926 --> 00:27:52.218
Ravachol's trial down there
but--and I went to Saint-Etienne

00:27:52.218 --> 00:27:55.710
to try to find if he actually
went there,

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.297
and the police think he did but
I have no positive proof of

00:27:58.297 --> 00:28:00.516
that.
Anyway, he--the police

00:28:00.516 --> 00:28:04.329
informants, and the police were
everywhere.

00:28:04.329 --> 00:28:07.137
If you want to see this,
Joseph Conrad has a wonderful

00:28:07.137 --> 00:28:09.520
novel called The Secret
Agent, and G.K.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.487
Chesterton has another one
called The Man Who Would be

00:28:12.487 --> 00:28:14.711
Thursday,
in which all seven anarchists

00:28:14.711 --> 00:28:17.890
in this anarchist group turn out
to be police spies;

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.719
and London was just riddled
with police spies,

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:22.669
watching the Dutch,
and Spanish,

00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:25.499
and French, and Russian,
and Czech anarchists,

00:28:25.499 --> 00:28:27.899
and all of the others.
But, anyway,

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:30.776
he was overheard telling
somebody, "I didn't put enough

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:33.440
nitroglycerin into this one and
it didn't work,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.745
but I'm going to put a little
more acid next time and we'll

00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:38.231
see what happens."
And the police report,

00:28:38.231 --> 00:28:41.230
which I've seen,
assigned him the number

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.844
318,532, and so he had a police
existence, which was good for

00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:48.359
me.
The police, as I said,

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:53.525
had infiltrated these groups.
One of the police spies,

00:28:53.525 --> 00:28:59.641
who was known as X number 4,
reported that the old ways of

00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:04.900
the anarchists no longer seemed
to be in play,

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.196
that where anarchists had used
to go to these big halls where

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:10.119
the police were scribbling
notes,

00:29:10.119 --> 00:29:13.283
and identifying everybody who
was there, that the ones you had

00:29:13.283 --> 00:29:16.342
to worry about were not the ones
who were in the hall giving

00:29:16.342 --> 00:29:19.349
speeches but the ones who were
lurking in the shadows,

00:29:19.349 --> 00:29:24.719
looking for other people,
with evil deeds,

00:29:24.719 --> 00:29:29.195
as it were, in mind.
They were the ones who would

00:29:29.195 --> 00:29:33.008
show up and then leave quickly.
These were the most violent

00:29:33.008 --> 00:29:37.426
ones, the ones who were capable
of carrying out propaganda by

00:29:37.426 --> 00:29:40.031
the deed.
They were not the

00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:44.690
halbeurs,
the posers, or the boasters;

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:49.754
they were off by themselves.
And they reflected a debate

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:53.019
within anarchist circles between
the associationalists,

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:56.250
who would end up being
syndicalists,

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.680
and those who believed in
individual autonomy,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.783
the single anarchist making his
decision to go out and

00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:10.675
kill--individual autonomy.
And, thus, I use the

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:16.384
description of this lecture,
for better or for worse,

00:30:16.384 --> 00:30:20.481
as dynamite club;
but dynamite club was the

00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:23.599
perception of,
not the police because they

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:26.230
knew better,
but of the public,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:31.279
that imagined that behind every
incident, every sardine can,

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:36.750
was a nefarious plot to destroy
organized society.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.110
There was no club,
but there were some violent

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.397
individuals capable
of--minorities within the

00:30:43.397 --> 00:30:46.309
anarchist movement--of doing
deeds.

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:50.868
On the eleventh--backing up one
year, for reasons we'll see--the

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:54.485
eleventh of November,
1892, an employee of the mine

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:57.958
company of Carmaux,
those mining strikes that had

00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:00.779
catapulted Jaurès to
fame,

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:05.354
found a suspicious looking
package on the floor outside the

00:31:05.354 --> 00:31:09.850
company door at eleven Avenue de
L'Opéra--there,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.930
eleven, up on the left.
This is 1900, this picture.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.199
I've gotten in that building
too, my son and I did,

00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:17.059
and I showed him where he put
the bomb;

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:20.670
it's still a very elegant
building.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.715
And they carried it downstairs
rather stupidly,

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.960
placed it on the sidewalk at
the back entrance,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.169
and a policeman came along and
said, "well you better take it

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:32.392
to the police station,"
not noticing that there were

00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:37.410
little powders that seemed to be
coming out of this machine,

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.349
as they used to call them in
those days.

00:31:39.349 --> 00:31:43.131
It was a reversible bomb,
it was a bomb not made by a

00:31:43.131 --> 00:31:47.421
fuse but by chemicals and when
they came together would blow

00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:49.750
up.
And so these poor policemen are

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.159
carrying it to the nearest
police station,

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:54.920
which is there--no,
that's the building now;

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.089
you can get into it,
it's on the first floor.

00:31:57.089 --> 00:31:59.109
I love stuff like that,
just love it.

00:31:59.109 --> 00:32:01.339
That's the police station,
which is still there also.

00:32:01.339 --> 00:32:05.589
And, so, they carry it through
the first courtyard.

00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:07.260
One guy says,
"hurry up, it's heavy."

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.961
It was a heavy thing.
They put it in,

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:14.112
put it down on the table and
boom, arms, legs everywhere,

00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:18.039
gone, five people killed in the
most horrible way.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:23.536
The bomb had been wrapped in a
newspaper, the issue of Le

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:28.753
Temps, from June first,
1892, which related the story

00:32:28.753 --> 00:32:33.970
of the arrest of Émile
Henry and his brother.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.773
Émile Henry left Paris
the next day for London,

00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:40.410
sending along his apologies.
He was on a list of one hundred

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.185
and thirty suspects.
He hangs around Fitzroy

00:32:43.185 --> 00:32:45.414
Square--which now is so
expensive, so,

00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:48.180
with Charlotte Street,
just full of one fancy

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.504
unaffordable restaurant after
another--he hangs around with

00:32:51.504 --> 00:32:54.684
the anarchists there.
A friend of Oscar Wilde's

00:32:54.684 --> 00:32:58.243
remembered meeting him there.
He spoke some English,

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:00.784
but not terribly well.
Once he told people,

00:33:00.784 --> 00:33:04.037
"today is the anniversary of
the dancing lesson," by which he

00:33:04.037 --> 00:33:05.990
meant bodies jumping up and
down,

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.670
in their last final agony,
in the police station.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.978
He was proud,
he had exterminated six

00:33:12.978 --> 00:33:14.371
enemies.
Malato said,

00:33:14.371 --> 00:33:18.293
"he grew in his own eyes.
He said to himself that his

00:33:18.293 --> 00:33:22.029
role as a destroying angel had
just begun."

00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:25.069
But, why didn't they think he
was a serious suspect?

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:29.025
Well, because a policeman that
particular day,

00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:33.508
that day, November 8th,
1892, he'd gone to work near

00:33:33.508 --> 00:33:37.640
the Gare du Nord,
the Station of the North.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.775
He had two errands to do;
one was near the Church of the

00:33:40.775 --> 00:33:44.690
Madeline, the second was way up
by--near the Arc d'Triomphe.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.769
His boss gave him some money to
do these errands.

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:51.665
And a policeman tried to do the
same thing, and said that he

00:33:51.665 --> 00:33:55.230
could not have gone back to his
house in Montmartre,

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.198
to the fifth floor,
Rue Veron--it doesn't matter,

00:33:59.198 --> 00:34:02.339
I love this stuff--and got the
bomb,

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:04.719
gone all the way back down to
the Avenue de l'Opèra,

00:34:04.719 --> 00:34:07.098
and then finished his errands
and got back in two hours and

00:34:07.098 --> 00:34:08.780
fifteen minutes--pas
possible.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.929
So, I did it.
I replaced tramway and omnibus

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:18.077
with buses and metros,
and I replaced a carriage--I

00:34:18.077 --> 00:34:22.128
never take cabs--with a cab,
and my cab couldn't turn left

00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:25.239
on the Avenue de l'Opèra,
so I subtracted 11 minutes.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:28.622
I paused--I couldn't get that
day into one of his houses where

00:34:28.622 --> 00:34:31.635
he put the bomb.
And I came back in about two

00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:34.369
hours and fifteen or sixteen
minutes.

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:38.798
Somebody did the same thing in
1894, and said he certainly

00:34:38.798 --> 00:34:43.544
could have done it.
Anyway, old Émile is off

00:34:43.544 --> 00:34:47.273
in London.
Now, I'm just trying now to

00:34:47.273 --> 00:34:51.846
imagine what he imagined.
What converts him to anarchism

00:34:51.846 --> 00:34:55.667
was the appalling gap between
the wealthy and the poor in

00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:59.299
Paris, and other places.
The heritage of the father,

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:01.949
of course, had something to do
with it.

00:35:01.949 --> 00:35:05.002
Never had people lived it up in
such flamboyant,

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:07.340
one could even say egregious
ways,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.479
as in Paris in the Belle
Époque,

00:35:10.479 --> 00:35:14.794
the so-called Gay â€˜90s.
Now, the nostalgia for that is

00:35:14.794 --> 00:35:17.719
a creation, really,
of how horrible things would be

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:20.315
later with World War I,
but still--and the Belle

00:35:20.315 --> 00:35:22.421
Époque was not
belle for very many

00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:26.210
people.
But what leads him to anarchism

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.451
is that.
Everywhere he lived--that was

00:35:28.451 --> 00:35:30.293
the only place,
the exception a minute ago,

00:35:30.293 --> 00:35:32.354
which was near the
Bastille--everywhere he lived

00:35:32.354 --> 00:35:34.929
was on the edge of Paris,
and everywhere he lived,

00:35:34.929 --> 00:35:37.500
the facades of the buildings
are still the same.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.219
This is one that's near
Montmartre--and they're building

00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:44.599
Sacré-Coeur,
this is from that same time.

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:49.195
It hadn't been completed yet
but--and its big bell drowning

00:35:49.195 --> 00:35:52.733
out the whole city,
hadn't been put in there,

00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:57.155
but this--Sacré-Coeur
was built where the Commune had

00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:59.899
started,
and it was seen as a monument

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:03.210
of penance for the Government of
the Moral Order.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:07.260
And, so, they hated this and
they refer constantly to this.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.123
They have fantasies.
Zola wrote a novel called

00:36:10.123 --> 00:36:12.796
Paris in 1898,
which is modeled after

00:36:12.796 --> 00:36:16.090
Émile Henry and some of
these other people.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.869
And the brother of this priest
who, like the REM record,

00:36:19.869 --> 00:36:23.373
is losing his religion,
he has these fantasies about

00:36:23.373 --> 00:36:27.101
blowing up Sacré-Coeur.
And Émile Henry lived

00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:29.288
near there, he lived on the Rue
Véron,

00:36:29.288 --> 00:36:32.224
which is now fairly chic.
He lived on the top floor up

00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:34.193
there.
That's where he went to get the

00:36:34.193 --> 00:36:36.262
bomb.
And then he moves into this

00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:38.334
place.
It says Villa Faucheur,

00:36:38.334 --> 00:36:41.987
and that's not fancy at all.
And this is the same

00:36:41.987 --> 00:36:46.232
façade.
He lived on the inside there in

00:36:46.232 --> 00:36:48.523
1894.
And I went up there because I

00:36:48.523 --> 00:36:51.443
got to see, I got to see.
And this is a pretty sketchy

00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:54.030
neighborhood and there are a lot
of dealers,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.752
drug deals going on here,
and I didn't want to look like

00:36:56.752 --> 00:36:59.113
a flic en civil,
a plain- clothes cop,

00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:02.111
and I don't want--I don't want
to look like I'm a wealthy

00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:03.679
tourist,
either.

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:06.789
And, so, I kind of hid behind a
truck and took pictures and then

00:37:06.789 --> 00:37:09.900
I walked in and said something
like, "salut les gars."

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.718
And I had to see.
But, when you walk out of

00:37:14.718 --> 00:37:19.274
this-- that's how you got in,
that's 1894-- when you walk out

00:37:19.274 --> 00:37:22.190
of this,
you turn right and there is the

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.478
Park of Belleville,
and down below the Place de la

00:37:25.478 --> 00:37:28.230
Roquette where he would lose his
head,

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.181
and he looked out--he was
lucky, he couldn't see the Tour

00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:33.289
Montparnasse,
which didn't then exist,

00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:35.230
but he could see symbols that
he hated.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.645
There was the Tour Eiffel that
had only been there--the Eiffel

00:37:37.645 --> 00:37:39.150
Tower had been there for five
years.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.420
There was the Pantheon,
where the State commemorated

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.460
its heroes, and there was Notre
Dame, which he hated as well.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.818
And, so, he once wrote that
love can lead you to hate--he

00:37:51.818 --> 00:37:56.889
wrote that before he was
guillotined, and he hated;

00:37:56.889 --> 00:37:58.950
he loved humanity in the
abstract.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:04.309
He loved his mom too.
But he loved humanity and he

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:09.369
hated the State,
and so he set out to kill.

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:12.672
So, these are sort of visual
signifiers, I guess in the new

00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:14.949
cultural history they would call
them,

00:38:14.949 --> 00:38:19.555
these buildings upon which--or
these monuments that he looked

00:38:19.555 --> 00:38:22.827
down and hated.
If you've read Balzac's Old

00:38:22.827 --> 00:38:26.826
Goriot ever in your reading
career, at the very end of the

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:30.630
story Rastignac is up at
Père Lachaise Cemetery,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.356
and he--and poor--Père
Lachaise is not poor,

00:38:33.356 --> 00:38:36.464
but the area around it is--and
he gestures down to western

00:38:36.464 --> 00:38:37.725
Paris,
the fancy Paris,

00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:40.317
and he says the equivalent of,
"it's war between you and me

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:41.949
now,
baby."

00:38:41.949 --> 00:38:45.247
But he wanted to make the big
time, he wanted to sleep with

00:38:45.247 --> 00:38:47.975
the right people,
he wanted to just do better and

00:38:47.975 --> 00:38:50.661
better, for himself.
And Émile Henry says,

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.266
points down in those
neighborhoods,

00:38:52.266 --> 00:38:54.154
and he says,
"it's war between you and me

00:38:54.154 --> 00:38:56.260
now, baby."
And he meant it.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:02.937
And he built bombs and he went
out to kill, at a time when

00:39:02.937 --> 00:39:09.849
anarchist deeds were being
celebrated by some anarchists.

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:13.697
The explosive device that he
threw into the Café

00:39:13.697 --> 00:39:16.662
Terminus, February 1894,
hit a chandelier,

00:39:16.662 --> 00:39:19.409
then a marble table,
and fell to the ground

00:39:19.409 --> 00:39:22.261
exploding.
Twenty people were wounded,

00:39:22.261 --> 00:39:25.033
of whom one later died.
Broken glass,

00:39:25.033 --> 00:39:29.082
pieces of tables and chairs,
blood and injured people,

00:39:29.082 --> 00:39:33.739
fear was everywhere.
An architect had five wounds,

00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:38.706
a draftsman seventeen.
Henry had seen--had been seen,

00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:43.239
he'd after all sipped his
second beer, first also,

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:45.994
and at one point,
not so he wouldn't be

00:39:45.994 --> 00:39:49.329
caught--so we can rule out
indirect suicide,

00:39:49.329 --> 00:39:51.863
which I'll talk about just
briefly in a minute--he said,

00:39:51.863 --> 00:39:53.890
"oh, where's the scoundrel that
did this?"

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.053
and runs away.
And he's chased by policemen,

00:39:58.053 --> 00:40:01.467
by an apprentice barber,
by a contrôleur

00:40:01.467 --> 00:40:04.889
from the tramway,
and they finally catch him

00:40:04.889 --> 00:40:08.459
around the corner from the Gare
Saint-Lazare,

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:12.030
and he fires point blank with
his pistol.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.998
He also had--his knife had
poison on it,

00:40:14.998 --> 00:40:18.461
as well.
One policeman called Poisson

00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:22.706
was very lucky to have escaped
with his life,

00:40:22.706 --> 00:40:28.110
because his big wallet was hit
by one of these shots.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.108
And, so, he's put in prison
here, in the

00:40:31.108 --> 00:40:35.029
Conciergerie--and that
cell no longer exists,

00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:38.331
that he was in.
Danton, and Robespierre,

00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:42.322
and Marie Antoinette,
and Louis XVI were also in this

00:40:42.322 --> 00:40:44.408
prison.
And one of the great sources

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.433
about this guy's life was the
prison guards,

00:40:46.433 --> 00:40:49.070
because they're trying to get
information out of him,

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.687
and he tries to convert them to
anarchism, and they have a very

00:40:52.687 --> 00:40:54.730
interesting kind of
relationship.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.731
The first night he was in
prison, friends of his broke

00:40:58.731 --> 00:41:03.111
into his room and took out
enough dynamite to make fourteen

00:41:03.111 --> 00:41:06.501
or fifteen other bombs,
and so Paris is,

00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:09.289
to say the least,
on high alert.

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:17.243
And, so, Émile Henry was
put on trial and,

00:41:17.243 --> 00:41:23.539
in a flourish,
he saluted anarchism,

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:28.743
and gave a declaration for
anarchism that was read,

00:41:28.743 --> 00:41:32.433
and is still read today,
where he says,

00:41:32.433 --> 00:41:36.719
"you have garroted us in Spain,
you have hung us in Germany,

00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:41.541
you have shot us here and
there, you have guillotined us

00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:46.890
in France, but what you can
never do is extinguish anarchy,

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:54.948
because its roots are too deep."
Not surprisingly,

00:41:54.948 --> 00:41:59.650
he was condemned to be
executed, and he was,

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.039
on the^( )21st of May,
1894.

00:42:03.039 --> 00:42:06.830
And it's in early morning,
at four in the morning,

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.929
and the executioners all come
from the same family,

00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:14.210
and this guy called Diebler was
the executioner.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.039
I got to go back to that woman
in a minute.

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:19.108
This is Dibler,
who was called Monsieur Paris,

00:42:19.108 --> 00:42:21.972
who was the chief executioner
and, for him,

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:25.449
one more execution was just one
more execution.

00:42:25.449 --> 00:42:28.789
The last public execution in
France was 1936.

00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:32.333
The last execution in France
using a guillotine,

00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:34.896
of course, comme
d'habitude,

00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:38.449
was 1972 or 1973;
I can't remember what date.

00:42:38.449 --> 00:42:42.328
And the chill of that morning,
where people paid for seats on

00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:46.207
the roof, and there were little
children whose parents bought

00:42:46.207 --> 00:42:50.215
them seats as if they were--on
the roof as if they were outside

00:42:50.215 --> 00:42:54.030
Wrigley Field watching the Cubs
from a roof far away.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:58.386
Executions were festive events
for those people,

00:42:58.386 --> 00:43:02.830
also, finishing their nights.
And there was always sort of

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.802
some speculation about,
"when this is going to happen,

00:43:05.802 --> 00:43:08.269
when is he finally going to be
executed?"

00:43:08.269 --> 00:43:10.720
And the scene,
which I've tried to recreate in

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.497
this book, of Dibler,
of the wagons with the wood of

00:43:13.497 --> 00:43:16.899
justice showing up,
and with the apprentices doing

00:43:16.899 --> 00:43:21.341
their work and putting up this
guillotine, as if you're putting

00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:26.070
together this basically perfect
toy that didn't need any nails,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.179
because everything fit together
so well.

00:43:28.179 --> 00:43:31.206
Really, these guillotine scenes
were so important for

00:43:31.206 --> 00:43:33.884
anarchists, also,
because it's part of the idea

00:43:33.884 --> 00:43:36.619
of martyrdom,
of revolutionary immortality.

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.360
This comes from a Christian
religion also,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.699
doesn't it, the execution
scenes.

00:43:41.699 --> 00:43:48.276
Again, you see what I'm saying
in that, but these scenes of the

00:43:48.276 --> 00:43:54.322
martyrdom and the use the
anarchists put to this are still

00:43:54.322 --> 00:43:58.474
rather important.
Now, was this a form of

00:43:58.474 --> 00:44:01.234
indirect suicide?
He'd fallen in love with the

00:44:01.234 --> 00:44:03.896
wife of an anarchist;
and her building is still there

00:44:03.896 --> 00:44:06.871
too, ironically not far away
from the place where he was

00:44:06.871 --> 00:44:08.768
executed.
And he hit on her,

00:44:08.768 --> 00:44:12.930
and they would go out with the
husband to his auberge,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.370
and he would proclaim his love,
and she kind of blew him off.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.595
Was it indirect suicide?
No, obviously not,

00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:23.275
because he tries to escape at
the end, and then she,

00:44:23.275 --> 00:44:25.639
in a real anticipation of the
modern life,

00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:29.485
she is out giving interviews to
the journalists after his

00:44:29.485 --> 00:44:31.072
execution.
She's saying,

00:44:31.072 --> 00:44:34.180
"oh he loved me so much,
and one could well understand

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.896
why."
And the whole thing was just

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:40.602
incredible.
But it was not any kind of

00:44:40.602 --> 00:44:44.800
indirect suicide at all.
But, what do I mean about the

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.330
origins of modern terrorism?
What was new about it?

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:53.921
Well, a couple of things.
Ravachol, Vaillant were very

00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:56.280
poor.
Ravachol was a pauvre

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.393
type, a sad sack;
Vaillant was not,

00:44:58.393 --> 00:45:02.084
he was a very honorable person.
Most of the people in Western

00:45:02.084 --> 00:45:06.400
Europe--there were some
exceptions in the Russian case,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.789
but these weren't anarchists,
it's a group called People's

00:45:10.789 --> 00:45:14.324
Will--were ordinary workers.
Émile Henry was an

00:45:14.324 --> 00:45:16.559
intellectual;
he was an intellectual.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:20.489
That's new, but that's not as
important as what else was new.

00:45:20.489 --> 00:45:25.347
Instead of targeting a head of
state, or a uniformed person,

00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:29.654
as other anarchists had done,
he just picked people who were

00:45:29.654 --> 00:45:32.168
having a beer,
petty bourgeois that he hated

00:45:32.168 --> 00:45:34.389
because they propped up
capitalism,

00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:36.493
and threw the bomb at them,
knowing he was going to kill a

00:45:36.493 --> 00:45:38.265
lot of them.
He sat there and looked at

00:45:38.265 --> 00:45:40.825
them--there's a very amazing
scene in The Battle of

00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:42.478
Algiers,
in the movie The Battle of

00:45:42.478 --> 00:45:44.239
Algiers, where this woman's
going to place a bomb,

00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:47.406
and she's looking at people
that are going to die because of

00:45:47.406 --> 00:45:50.626
what she is doing there--and he
looked at these people and he

00:45:50.626 --> 00:45:53.465
said,
"I'm going to kill you,

00:45:53.465 --> 00:45:58.380
I'm going to kill you,
because I love--I hate."

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.432
And that's really new about it.
Is it worth at all musing about

00:46:04.432 --> 00:46:09.789
what this has to do with modern
terrorism?

00:46:09.789 --> 00:46:14.239
I don't know,
just a few reflections;

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:17.514
there's no doubt about that,
that there are some

00:46:17.514 --> 00:46:19.905
connections.
If you take Osama bin Laden,

00:46:19.905 --> 00:46:21.169
for example,
he announced,

00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:23.697
as everybody knows,
in the late nineties that he'll

00:46:23.697 --> 00:46:25.994
attack civilians,
American civilians,

00:46:25.994 --> 00:46:29.234
just like American military
people-- that's perfectly

00:46:29.234 --> 00:46:32.165
obvious.
Another connection is within

00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:36.496
modern terrorism you have this
sort of alliance between

00:46:36.496 --> 00:46:39.864
intellectuals,
students, and people who are

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:43.610
simply down and out.
There are big differences also.

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.531
The suicide bomber is
something--no,

00:46:45.531 --> 00:46:47.674
it's very different.
But, still, there are things

00:46:47.674 --> 00:46:50.199
that are worth thinking about.
Third, the whole idea of

00:46:50.199 --> 00:46:53.115
revolutionary immortality,
that you kill people,

00:46:53.115 --> 00:46:56.280
you die, and you have
revolutionary immortality.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.760
For many fundamentalist
terrorists you pass immediately

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.029
into this nirvana.
Fourth, both sets of terrorists

00:47:05.029 --> 00:47:09.322
target a powerful enemy,
a structure they set out to

00:47:09.322 --> 00:47:14.886
destroy and try to--"kill one,
warn a thousand," goes an old

00:47:14.886 --> 00:47:18.075
Chinese proverb.
And they want to attack the

00:47:18.075 --> 00:47:21.130
State and capitalism,
in the case of the anarchists,

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.664
and the targets are perfectly
obvious in the case of

00:47:24.664 --> 00:47:28.401
contemporary terrorists as well.
Fifth, dynamite,

00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:32.201
like roadside bombs,
are seen as leveling the

00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:35.598
playing field.
You attack, you can prove that

00:47:35.598 --> 00:47:38.619
you are strong when,
in reality, you are weak.

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:42.708
They demonstrate that powerful
states are vulnerable even to

00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:45.480
small groups of determined
anarchists.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.101
Next, also these groups,
as I said, their tendency is

00:47:49.101 --> 00:47:53.139
always to try to find one person
running the whole show.

00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:56.482
That's absolutely not the case
in the case of the anarchists,

00:47:56.482 --> 00:47:59.380
as I already said,
nor is it the case now as well.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.597
So, the French government then,
and officials now,

00:48:01.597 --> 00:48:03.860
have a tendency to look for
centrally organized,

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.015
massive conspiracy,
instead of acknowledging the

00:48:07.015 --> 00:48:10.305
role of small groups,
or even isolated individuals

00:48:10.305 --> 00:48:14.199
undertaking locally organized or
freelance operations.

00:48:14.199 --> 00:48:17.180
Anarchists, to repeat,
always emphasize the full

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.769
autonomy of the individual;
indeed, the potentially

00:48:20.769 --> 00:48:24.420
murderous individual as the
case, as I've said.

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.387
And I obviously detest
everything that Émile

00:48:28.387 --> 00:48:31.879
Henry stood for,
but I've tried to understand

00:48:31.879 --> 00:48:35.263
his hatred.
Yet, there's one more thing

00:48:35.263 --> 00:48:39.567
that could be added too,
is that when you think of the

00:48:39.567 --> 00:48:42.758
word terrorism,
the word terrorism was

00:48:42.758 --> 00:48:47.710
originally applied to actions
taken by the State to terrorize.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:51.885
"The Terror" was terrorizing
opponents in the French

00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:55.200
Revolution.
And it's often forgotten that

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.701
the vast majority of victims of
terror are victims of State

00:48:59.701 --> 00:49:02.382
terrorism.
And the anarchists hated the

00:49:02.382 --> 00:49:05.847
State because they'd seen up
close what State terrorism did

00:49:05.847 --> 00:49:09.723
in the wake of the Commune,
and the beating of the police

00:49:09.723 --> 00:49:13.889
at Clichy, the massacre of the
innocents, of these women,

00:49:13.889 --> 00:49:17.789
young women gunned down during
the strike in the north,

00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:20.750
or demonstrations in the north
in 1891,

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.898
must be remembered.
During the 1890s the anarchist

00:49:24.898 --> 00:49:27.972
attacks, which were terrible,
killed a maximum of sixty

00:49:27.972 --> 00:49:30.820
people--tragic--wounding more
than two hundred.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.679
But, if you look at State
terrorism, the ratio somebody

00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:40.000
has figured out stands at
approximately 260:1;

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.892
two hundred and sixty victims
of State terrorism as opposed to

00:49:43.892 --> 00:49:46.190
one victim of this horrible
thing.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.277
Terrorism has thus become part
of the political process,

00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:51.860
but it's been called a danse
macabre,

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.888
or sort of a macabre dance
between states and their

00:49:55.888 --> 00:49:59.374
fiercest opponents.
The two interact dynamically

00:49:59.374 --> 00:50:02.487
and need each other.
The hatred of dissidents is

00:50:02.487 --> 00:50:06.220
only further stoked by the
over-reaction of authorities;

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.886
it simply encourages attack.
And, certainly,

00:50:10.886 --> 00:50:13.119
this is not a course in
political science,

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:16.223
but the reaction of the United
States government and other

00:50:16.223 --> 00:50:20.172
governments to the horrible,
horrible attacks on September^(

00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:23.019
)11th are a pretty good example
of that.

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:28.004
When states take tactics that
swell the hatred of their

00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:32.824
opponents by abusing prisoners,
by torturing prisoners and by

00:50:32.824 --> 00:50:35.884
that sort of thing,
that line between that goes all

00:50:35.884 --> 00:50:38.210
the way back to Spain of the
1890s,

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.081
the first decade of the
twentieth century,

00:50:40.081 --> 00:50:42.090
back to the Paris Commune
before that and,

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:47.659
unfortunately, to our very day.
That is the story of

00:50:47.659 --> 00:50:51.000
Émile Henry.
See you on Wednesday.

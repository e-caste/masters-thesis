00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.340
Courtney has just pointed out
that today is November 17^(th),

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.060
the significance of which had
evaded me,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.440
but it's the accession day of
Elizabeth I,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.320
&gt;
 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.279
which would have been greeted
in the sixteenth and seventeenth

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.070
centuries with bell ringing and
so forth.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.645
It's no longer kept as a
national holiday but it used to

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:21.970
be.
 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.675
Okay, but today we have other
business, the Restoration and

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:35.380
the run-up to the so-called
Glorious Revolution of 1688.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.996
So to start,
the Restoration of May 1660

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:43.817
clearly represented a fresh
start for the monarchy in

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:44.930
England.
 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.846
But it was a fresh start that
has to be understood against the

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:52.571
background of past events which
could not be forgotten even

00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:55.910
though people tried hard not to
talk about them.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.520
The constitutional crisis of
1640 had of course arisen from a

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.900
functional breakdown in the
relationship between the crown

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.671
and the political nation;
a breakdown traceable

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:12.783
ultimately to their loss of
confidence in the purposes of

00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:16.581
royal government and the fear,
in particular,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:21.784
that royal policy was favoring
"popery and arbitrary

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:23.180
power."
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.471
Initially, that crisis of 1640
to '41 had led to the successful

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.509
efforts of the Long Parliament
to reverse the trend in royal

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.290
policy and to put limits on the
King for the future.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.402
A civil war of course had to be
fought to try to preserve those

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.724
gains,
and in the course of the war

00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:47.560
further dimensions of the
situation emerged,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.906
notably the demand for
"liberty of

00:01:50.906 --> 00:01:52.580
conscience."
 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.110
So, in all of that,
as I described last week,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.254
the one political moment which
might have produced a broadly

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:03.609
acceptable settlement had been
in 1647 when Cromwell and Ireton

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.825
offered Charles the Heads of the
Proposals as the basis for a

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:09.020
settlement.
 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.021
But as you know,
that moment was lost with

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.830
disastrous consequences for the
King.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.382
Well, the Restoration has to be
seen in this context of

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:23.490
well-remembered events.
 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.038
It was intended to restore the
situation to what it had been in

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:34.410
1641 after the reforming
statutes of the Long Parliament,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.209
with the addition of the
granting of some liberty of

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.348
conscience to Protestant
dissenters,

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:43.780
which Charles II had promised
in his Declaration of Breda.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.488
And if this had happened it
might indeed have provided a

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:53.197
lasting settlement--but
unfortunately it didn't work out

00:02:53.197 --> 00:02:54.310
that way.
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.765
The architect of the
Restoration settlement was

00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:01.747
Edward Hyde, the Earl of
Clarendon, Charles II's chief

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:04.979
minister at the beginning of his
reign;

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.536
a man who'd served his father
and advised the young King

00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.669
throughout his period of exile.
 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.848
Now Clarendon was very much a
constitutional royalist.

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:21.168
His essential idea was a return
to the constitutional situation

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:25.560
of 1641 including the reforms,
which he had supported at the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.804
time before the outbreak of war,
with just some modifications

00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:31.270
where necessary.
 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.074
In the Convention Parliament
which began the Restoration in

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:37.803
1660,
all of the acts of parliament

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:42.361
which had been signed by Charles
I before the outbreak of war

00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:43.729
were confirmed.
 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.063
That included all the reforms
and it included the Triennial

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:52.025
Act laying down that a
parliament should meet at least

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:53.669
every three years.
 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.877
In addition,
royal land which had been

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:59.098
confiscated during the Republic
was restored to it,

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.359
church land which had been
confiscated was restored to the

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.932
Church of England,
an indemnity was granted to the

00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:09.378
army for all acts committed
during the war,

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.607
they were paid,
and they were disbanded except

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:16.264
for a number of guard's
regiments which were kept in

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:18.129
London about the King.
 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.665
In addition,
Parliament passed a general Act

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:26.930
of Indemnity and Oblivion to
cover both sides during the war,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.540
excepting from it only the
surviving regicides.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.014
Eleven of those who had signed
Charles' death warrant were

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:37.978
executed and,
as you know,

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:41.824
the corpses of Cromwell and
Ireton were dug up and

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:43.160
desecrated.
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.120
Okay;
so far, so good.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.730
But the so-called Cavalier
Parliament,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.519
which was elected in 1661 to
replace the Convention

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:56.670
Parliament,
continued the process of the

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.701
Restoration in a manner which
turned out to be far more

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:05.107
generous to the crown and far
more vindictive to the crown's

00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:06.750
former opponents.
 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.449
All military authority was
vested in the King.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.721
The crown was granted a regular
income of over a million pounds

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:18.579
a year from the customs and a
new tax, the Hearth Tax.

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:23.163
In 1662, a Licensing Act
re-imposed control of the press

00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:27.579
which had been free for the
previous twenty years,

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:29.800
and above all two further steps
were taken.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.220
First of all,
the Triennial Act was weakened.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.644
It was altered to lay down that
the parliamentary sessions

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:42.759
should take place at least once
every three years,

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.875
but there were no mandatory new
elections as had originally been

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:48.769
intended.
 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.435
In other words,
this gave the King the

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:55.543
opportunity to prolong an
existing parliament which was to

00:05:55.543 --> 00:06:00.011
his taste by simply proroguing
it and then having it reassemble

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:04.692
at least once every three years;
and Charles took advantage of

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:05.899
that opportunity.
 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:10.636
The Cavalier Parliament,
very favorable to the King,

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.815
elected in 1661,
was in fact continued without

00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:17.509
new elections until 1668.
 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.574
A second major change was that
the Cavalier Parliament showed

00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:27.723
no willingness to grant liberty
of conscience to dissenters as

00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:29.579
had been promised.
 

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:32.990
In 1662, the Church of England
was reestablished,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.398
the prayer book was
reintroduced--very little

00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:37.644
altered--
an Act of Uniformity was

00:06:37.644 --> 00:06:39.699
imposed on the whole kingdom.
 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.882
All clergy were required to
subscribe to the Act of

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:45.940
Uniformity or to be deprived of
their livings.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.009
As a result,
hundreds who couldn't in

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.250
conscience subscribe,
were deprived.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.091
And a number of additional acts
were introduced against

00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:00.230
dissenters between 1661 and
1665.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.230
They were banned from holding
office in any urban corporation.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.028
In 1664, they were banned from
holding religious services.

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:13.740
Only services of the Church of
England were permitted.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.218
A year later the Five Mile Act
banned dissenting clergymen from

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:21.759
living within five miles of any
corporate city;

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.879
places where traditionally they
had had a good deal of strength.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:32.315
Now this was not what Charles
II wanted, it wasn't what the

00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:36.910
Earl of Clarendon wanted,
but they accepted it.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.983
As a result,
a large minority of the

00:07:39.983 --> 00:07:45.519
population were forced in to the
position of being either active

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:50.000
or potential dissidents in
matters of religion.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.365
Surveys that have been done
suggest that Protestant

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:56.663
dissenters made up about ten
percent of the entire

00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:59.444
population,
though their strength varied a

00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:01.149
great deal from area to area.
 

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:03.824
In some parts of the kingdom
they were very thin on the

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.403
ground,
the county of Shropshire,

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:07.504
for example,
on the Welsh border,

00:08:07.504 --> 00:08:11.088
a survey done in 1672 reveals
very few of them.

00:08:11.088 --> 00:08:13.389
On the other hand,
in the town of Colchester in

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:16.497
Essex on the east coast,
it's thought that as much as a

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:18.959
third of the population were
dissenters,

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.129
many of them Quakers.
 

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:25.879
And then, if we turn to London,
London appears to have had

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:30.129
about a fifth of its population
favoring dissent.

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:35.154
A minority, only a fifth,
but remember in a city the size

00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:39.548
of London that meant a hundred
thousand people.

00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:44.659
So, the Restoration had
restored too much.

00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:46.658
It had gone back too far.
 

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:50.692
It restored not only the
consensual constitutional

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:55.677
position of 1641,
but also some of the tensions

00:08:55.677 --> 00:09:00.278
and some of the stresses of the
1640s,

00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:03.791
and it had weakened the
position of parliament in one

00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:10.700
important respect,
by modifying the Triennial Act.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.365
Well, obviously enough
religious dissenters had good

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:18.320
reason to be very quickly
disappointed and disillusioned

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.815
with the Restoration settlement,
but more broadly it took some

00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:28.408
time before tensions began to
re-emerge fully.

00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:32.370
Charles II was welcomed back as
the restorer of order.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.759
He was young;
he was only thirty.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.830
He was tall and handsome.
 

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.453
He was a man who was energetic
only in his sports and his

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:43.658
pleasures.
 

00:09:43.658 --> 00:09:47.658
The fact that he has had many
mistresses is very well known.

00:09:47.658 --> 00:09:51.009
He managed to father thirteen
illegitimate children,

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:52.879
all of whom were given the
surname Fitzroy,

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:56.253
"son of the king"--
Fitzrovia in the west end of

00:09:56.253 --> 00:09:58.879
London is named after one of
them--

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:01.279
but he never managed to have a
legitimate heir.

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.559
He was happy to be king though.
 

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:04.909
He played the part well.
 

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:05.919
He was intelligent.
 

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.970
He was shrewd. He was affable.
 

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.509
He swanned around St.
 

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:13.178
James' Park with his spaniels
and his mistresses.

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:16.038
He attended meetings of the
Royal Society.

00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:19.904
He showed his courage during
the great fire of London in 1666

00:10:19.904 --> 00:10:22.288
when he joined in the
firefighting.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.029
He knew he looked good in a wet
shirt.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:27.379
&gt;
 

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:30.865
But despite all of these
qualities Charles had no

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:35.225
particular political vision or
strategy, and perhaps that was

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:36.460
just as well.
 

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.089
He knew that beneath the public
celebrations of his restoration

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:44.796
the Restoration had been,
and in a very real sense

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:47.220
remained, essentially
conditional,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.269
and he had no desire,
as he put it himself,

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:52.870
"to go on my travels
again."

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.408
He was happy to be back.
 

00:10:55.408 --> 00:10:59.033
Nevertheless,
if he had no particular vision,

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:04.058
he did have his preferences and
from time to time they got him

00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:05.460
into trouble.
 

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.000
Principal amongst them were
first of all his admiration for

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.085
the monarchy of his cousin,
King Louis XIV of France,

00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:19.663
the so-called Sun King,
the absolute monarch of

00:11:19.663 --> 00:11:23.673
Europe's emergent great power
and the very model of

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:28.716
monarchical magnificence,
displayed in his palace at

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:29.970
Versailles.
 

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.740
Secondly, there was Charles'
sympathy,

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.830
to put it no stronger,
for Roman Catholicism,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.833
the religion of his mother,
as a religion which he regarded

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.509
as more suitable to monarchy.
 

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:47.702
And these preferences led him
into interconnected initiatives

00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:51.476
in foreign policy and in matters
of religion which were

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:55.038
potentially alienating to some
of his subjects;

00:11:55.038 --> 00:12:02.393
far more alienating than his
raffish court or his personal

00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:04.070
debauchery.
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.582
In 1665 to '7,
England fought a brief and

00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:12.765
unsuccessful naval war with the
Dutch, the Second Dutch War,

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:16.278
triggered off by commercial
rivalry.

00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:21.076
It was a deeply humiliating
episode and especially so since

00:12:21.076 --> 00:12:25.624
everyone remembered very well
Oliver Cromwell's military

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:31.000
strength and the triumph in the
First Dutch War in the 1650s.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.436
Samuel Pepys,
Secretary of the Navy at this

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:35.268
time,
confided to his diary

00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:39.306
repeatedly his dissatisfaction
with the manner in which the war

00:12:39.306 --> 00:12:42.711
had been conducted;
his dissatisfaction with the

00:12:42.711 --> 00:12:46.655
way in which the King and his
council would not attend to

00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:50.529
business as had been done under
the previous regime.

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:53.750
As a result of the failures of
the Second Dutch War,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.363
the Earl of Clarendon was
sacrificed as a scapegoat and he

00:12:57.363 --> 00:13:00.849
was replaced with a ministry
which is known as the Cabal

00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:04.144
after the initial letters of the
principal ministers:

00:13:04.144 --> 00:13:07.028
Clifford,
Arlington, Buckingham,

00:13:07.028 --> 00:13:11.548
Ashley Cooper,
and Lauderdale.

00:13:11.548 --> 00:13:16.678
In 1670, under the Cabal
ministry Charles concluded the

00:13:16.678 --> 00:13:19.528
Treaty of Dover with France.
 

00:13:19.528 --> 00:13:26.212
In it he agreed to ally with
France in any future war against

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:27.548
the Dutch.
 

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:32.169
It was not popular with those
in the kingdom who saw France as

00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:35.200
the truly rising threat of the
1660s,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.288
potentially a new Spain aiming
at European dominance;

00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:45.265
people who also saw the Dutch
as the principal opponents of

00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.240
that French hegemony.
 

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.187
And the treaty would have been
even less popular if people had

00:13:51.187 --> 00:13:54.100
known that it contained two
secret clauses.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.000
First of all,
Charles had agreed secretly

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.350
that at an appropriate moment he
would suspend the penal laws

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.379
against Roman Catholics.
 

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:08.330
Secondly, he had agreed with
Louis that he would himself

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.649
convert to Catholicism at a
propitious moment.

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:16.427
In return for this he received,
again in secret,

00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:21.168
a quarter of a million pounds a
year pension from France.

00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:25.115
Well, in the aftermath of the
Treaty of Dover,

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:30.730
in 1672 Louis XIV declared war
on the Netherlands and invaded.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.649
Charles issued a Declaration of
Indulgence in which he used his

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:40.408
power as supreme head of the
church to suspend the penal laws

00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:45.168
against both Protestant
dissenters and Roman Catholics,

00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:48.191
and indeed he allowed
dissenters to publicly worship

00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:49.908
in licensed meeting houses.
 

00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:53.908
Two days later England also
declared war on the Dutch,

00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:56.850
the beginning of the Third
Dutch War.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.320
This war proved again to be
very unpopular,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.596
notably because it was highly
unsuccessful militarily and

00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:07.871
there was a growing sympathy
amongst the political public

00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:11.690
with the plucky Dutch and their
young leader,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.360
William of Orange,
standing up against the French.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.219
The Declaration of Indulgence
with its granting of a degree of

00:15:21.219 --> 00:15:26.077
religious liberty to those other
than members of the Church of

00:15:26.077 --> 00:15:30.697
England was even more unpopular
with the Anglican-dominated

00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:32.769
Cavalier Parliament.
 

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:37.552
It met again in 1673 for a new
session and almost immediately

00:15:37.552 --> 00:15:40.899
attacked the Declaration of
Indulgence,

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.289
declaring that "penal
statutes in matters

00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:48.057
ecclesiastical cannot be
suspended but by an act of

00:15:48.057 --> 00:15:51.448
parliament"
and that the suspending power

00:15:51.448 --> 00:15:54.840
which the King had used was
innovatory.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.687
"No such power,"
said the House of Commons,

00:15:58.687 --> 00:16:02.980
"was ever claimed or
executed by his predecessors;.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.380
Faced with this kind of
opposition from people who had

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.490
previously been his strongest
supporters, Charles backed down.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.524
He showed his characteristic
unwillingness to push his own

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:18.490
preferences beyond the bounds of
political expediency.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:23.375
The Declaration of Indulgence
was withdrawn and under the

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:28.874
threat of withholding supply for
the war effort he agreed to the

00:16:28.874 --> 00:16:32.538
passage by parliament of the
Test Act.

00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:36.832
The Test Act was an act laying
down that all officers of the

00:16:36.832 --> 00:16:40.908
crown must swear the oath of
supremacy and allegiance and

00:16:40.908 --> 00:16:44.548
take a declaration against the
Catholic doctrine of

00:16:44.548 --> 00:16:48.404
transubstantiation and take
communion in the Church of

00:16:48.404 --> 00:16:52.801
England;
so it was a test of Anglican

00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:55.340
religious conformity.
 

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.692
Prominent amongst its early
victims were first of all Lord

00:16:58.692 --> 00:17:01.153
Clifford,
one of Charles' chief ministers

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.607
who was a secret Catholic,
and secondly,

00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:07.212
and even more importantly,
James, Duke of York,

00:17:07.212 --> 00:17:11.460
Charles' younger brother who at
this point was,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.884
of course, also the heir to the
throne since Charles and his

00:17:15.884 --> 00:17:19.667
Portuguese wife,
Catherine of Braganza,

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:21.920
had had no children.
 

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.372
James had declared in 1673,
most un-propitiously,

00:17:26.372 --> 00:17:29.338
his conversion to Catholicism.
 

00:17:29.338 --> 00:17:34.068
Under the Test Act he was
excluded from high office.

00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:38.310
Well, this debacle led to the
collapse of the Cabal ministry

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.690
and the appointment of a new
chief minister,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.893
Thomas Osborne,
the Earl of Danby,

00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:47.342
who was fiercely Anglican--
that satisfied the Cavalier

00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:50.140
Parliament--
and who was also,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.430
as it happened,
pro-Dutch.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.682
But Charles was still secretly
getting a pension from the

00:17:57.682 --> 00:18:01.934
French in return for keeping
parliament out of session as

00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:03.528
much as possible.
 

00:18:03.528 --> 00:18:06.440
In 1677, when he had to call it
again,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.301
it met and tried to make the
voting of further taxes

00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:14.997
conditional upon Charles joining
the Dutch-led alliance against

00:18:14.997 --> 00:18:15.828
France.
 

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:19.058
And at this point the King
resisted successfully,

00:18:19.058 --> 00:18:22.953
arguing that if he allowed
parliament to prescribe his

00:18:22.953 --> 00:18:27.215
foreign policy "it is plain
that no prince or state in

00:18:27.215 --> 00:18:31.771
Europe would any longer believe
that the sovereignty of England

00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:34.048
rests in the crown."
 

00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:36.788
So Charles took a stand on that
point,

00:18:36.788 --> 00:18:41.217
but Danby nonetheless succeeded
in building at least one bridge

00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:46.384
with the Dutch when,
in 1677, he was able to arrange

00:18:46.384 --> 00:18:51.164
the marriage of Mary,
the daughter of James by an

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:54.940
earlier marriage,
Charles' niece and a Protestant

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.029
by upbringing.
 

00:18:56.029 --> 00:19:00.553
Her marriage was arranged to
William of Orange,

00:19:00.553 --> 00:19:05.567
an event which was to prove to
be of profound future

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:07.240
significance.
 

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.913
So, at this point Charles,
like his shrewd grandfather,

00:19:11.913 --> 00:19:16.326
James I, had proved himself
flexible enough to avoid

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:19.009
provoking political crisis.
 

00:19:19.009 --> 00:19:24.298
He knew when to give way as
well as when to stand.

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:29.613
But by the late 1670s anxieties
were growing about the threat of

00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:34.420
'popery and arbitrary power' at
home as well as abroad.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.328
It was made worse in 1674 when
the Duke of York,

00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:40.058
now a declared--an openly
declared--

00:19:40.058 --> 00:19:43.848
Catholic, married the Catholic
princess Mary of Modena,

00:19:43.848 --> 00:19:49.286
which posed the risk that there
might be the birth of a future

00:19:49.286 --> 00:19:55.078
heir to the throne who would be
brought up as a Roman Catholic.

00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:59.125
There was also a growing sense
of distance between the court

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:02.691
and the country and a growing
suspicion of the King's

00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:03.720
intentions.
 

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.078
It was in 1677 that Andrew
Marvell,

00:20:07.078 --> 00:20:10.200
best known today as a poet but
at that time member of

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.078
parliament for the town of Hull
in Yorkshire,

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:16.390
published, without putting his
name on it,

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:19.912
"An Account of the Growth
of Popery and Arbitrary

00:20:19.912 --> 00:20:23.834
Power" in which he argued
in his pamphlet that he could

00:20:23.834 --> 00:20:26.558
discern a plot to introduce what
we--

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.336
what he--described as
"absolute tyranny,"

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:31.723
"French slavery,"
and "Popish

00:20:31.723 --> 00:20:32.779
Idolatry."
 

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:37.371
These were the fears that were
circulating amongst Charles'

00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:39.430
opponents in parliament.
 

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.630
Clearly, we've been here before.
 

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.872
The highly combustible elements
of seventeenth-century English

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:51.740
political paranoia were being
mixed again,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.955
and the spark which was needed
to cause a near explosion was

00:20:56.955 --> 00:21:01.817
provided in the autumn of 1678
when one Titus Oates laid

00:21:01.817 --> 00:21:07.298
allegations of a Jesuit plot to
murder King Charles in order to

00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:11.190
hasten the succession of his
brother,

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.858
James, to the throne.
 

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:21.848
This was the beginning of the
so-called Popish Plot affair.

00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:25.461
That Titus Oates' wild
allegations were seriously

00:21:25.461 --> 00:21:30.202
listened to by parliament and by
the political public in general

00:21:30.202 --> 00:21:34.266
can be explained only by the
pre-existing atmosphere of

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:38.480
suspicion which had been
building up in the 1670s.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.460
But the allegations soon
acquired greater credibility.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.907
Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey,
the London magistrate who had

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:53.650
taken Oates' allegations,
was found murdered.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.650
Then a search of the house of
Prince James' former secretary,

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.007
Edward Coleman,
revealed real correspondence

00:22:02.007 --> 00:22:05.990
between the Duke of York's
secretary and Jesuits.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.210
Then there was the revelation
in December 1678 in parliament,

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.990
by an aggrieved former
ambassador, of the secret

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.369
clauses of the Treaty of Dover
of 1670,

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.088
which caused uproar.
 

00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:24.823
Parliament attempted to impeach
the Earl of Danby for his share

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:30.278
of responsibility for royal
policy and Charles was forced at

00:22:30.278 --> 00:22:35.920
last to dissolve the Cavalier
Parliament in January 1679.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.374
The Popish Plot precipitated
what Jonathan Scott has

00:22:40.374 --> 00:22:45.178
described as the second great
"crisis of popery and

00:22:45.178 --> 00:22:49.432
arbitrary power";
the Exclusion Crisis as it's

00:22:49.432 --> 00:22:52.666
called,
running from 1679 to 1681:

00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:58.461
Exclusion Crisis because it
involved attempts by parliament

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:02.471
to exclude James,
Duke of York,

00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:08.500
heir to the throne,
from the succession.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:15.710
The first Exclusion Parliament
met between March and May 1679.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.679
Elections to this new
parliament, the first elections

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:23.191
held since 1661,
took place in an atmosphere of

00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:25.940
tremendous political excitement.
 

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.816
When it met the Earl of Danby
was sent to the Tower of London

00:23:29.816 --> 00:23:32.660
where he remained for the next
five years.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.368
Parliament then proposed a bill
to exclude James,

00:23:36.368 --> 00:23:38.875
Duke of York,
from the succession and

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:42.982
persisted in demanding this
despite King Charles' offer that

00:23:42.982 --> 00:23:47.230
he would have limits put upon
the powers of appointment of any

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.108
future Catholic king.
 

00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:52.868
He was willing to give way to
some degree.

00:23:52.868 --> 00:23:56.207
Beyond that,
however, Charles was ready to

00:23:56.207 --> 00:23:56.940
resist.
 

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.482
Defending the legitimate
succession to the throne was one

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:04.078
issue that he would fight for.
 

00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:09.608
Parliament was dissolved and
James was sent off to Scotland

00:24:09.608 --> 00:24:12.660
to keep him out of harm's way.
 

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.406
This crisis now unleashed
political agitation and popular

00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:22.240
involvement in politics of a
kind which really hadn't been

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.358
seen since the 1640s.
 

00:24:24.358 --> 00:24:28.637
There was tremendous debate
over the exclusion issue in the

00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:32.548
coffeehouses and taverns of
London and the other major

00:24:32.548 --> 00:24:35.183
cities;
this debate fueled by an

00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:39.440
outbreak of pamphleteering which
was possible because the

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.848
Licensing Act controlling the
press had actually expired in

00:24:43.848 --> 00:24:48.333
1679 and parliament had been
dissolved before it had time to

00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:49.548
renew it.
 

00:24:49.548 --> 00:24:54.170
Temporarily,
the press was free again.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.443
Mass demonstrations took place
in London calling for a new

00:24:58.443 --> 00:24:59.420
parliament.
 

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.338
These street demonstrations
were orchestrated by a former

00:25:02.338 --> 00:25:06.031
member of Charles' government,
the Earl of Shaftesbury,

00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:10.390
and his friends in the
so-called Green Ribbon Club,

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.838
but they also demonstrated
genuine popular concern.

00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:16.942
There was a real basis of
popular concern which

00:25:16.942 --> 00:25:20.519
Shaftesbury and his friends
successfully mobilized.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:24.940
But the agitation wasn't all
one way.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.267
As the crisis deepened,
the emergence of two new terms

00:25:29.267 --> 00:25:33.051
in politics took place,
Whigs and Tories,

00:25:33.051 --> 00:25:38.429
terms which were adopted to
describe different political

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:43.512
positions both inside and
outside parliament over the

00:25:43.512 --> 00:25:45.858
issue of exclusion.
 

00:25:45.858 --> 00:25:50.140
The so-called Whigs specialized
in mounting processions through

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.212
London at which--which tended to
culminate in the burning of

00:25:54.212 --> 00:25:55.940
effigies of the pope.
 

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.259
They placed great emphasis upon
the threat of popery.

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:03.505
They placed a great deal of
emphasis also on the threat of

00:26:03.505 --> 00:26:04.528
arbitrary power.
 

00:26:04.528 --> 00:26:07.378
They talked a lot about the
need to defend England's

00:26:07.378 --> 00:26:09.619
religion,
liberties and property,

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:14.059
and called for a new parliament
which alone could save the day,

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:16.140
in their view.
 

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.261
The Tories on the other hand
placed their confidence in the

00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:20.759
King.
 

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:24.883
They branded the Whigs as being
predominantly dissenters in

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:28.336
sympathy religiously,
as closet Presbyterians,

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:31.828
as fomenters of insurrection
against the King,

00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:35.867
as secret Republicans,
as a threat to the Church of

00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:39.259
England and to England's true
liberties.

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:44.671
They repeatedly played upon the
threat of a new 1641,

00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:47.690
a new slide into civil war.
 

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.798
Behind these insulting labels
Whig and Tory,

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:57.645
then, lay emerging political
alignments rooted in differences

00:26:57.645 --> 00:27:01.483
of political principle,
and these divisions,

00:27:01.483 --> 00:27:03.962
as I've said,
were to be found not only

00:27:03.962 --> 00:27:07.810
amongst members of parliament
but also permeated deeply down

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.398
through society beyond the
political elite to the middle

00:27:11.398 --> 00:27:15.162
sort of people,
those who supported the

00:27:15.162 --> 00:27:19.000
demonstrations of one side or
another.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.424
Okay.
 

00:27:19.424 --> 00:27:24.186
Well, this fevered atmosphere
in the late 1670s and early

00:27:24.186 --> 00:27:29.374
1680s provided the background to
the parliamentary politics of

00:27:29.374 --> 00:27:30.818
those years.
 

00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:34.548
In October 1680,
another new parliament met.

00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:38.710
This one's usually known as the
Second Exclusion Parliament.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.128
Again the House of Commons
declared that it would grant

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:47.384
supply of money to the crown
only in return for a new

00:27:47.384 --> 00:27:48.940
exclusion bill.
 

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.616
Charles promptly dissolved it
in January 1681 and called for

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:58.690
yet another parliament this time
to meet not in London but in the

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:02.568
friendly city of Oxford,
two months later.

00:28:02.568 --> 00:28:07.180
The King was clearly playing
for time.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.395
In March 1681,
the Oxford Parliament met,

00:28:10.395 --> 00:28:14.900
again in an atmosphere of
tremendous public agitation.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.842
It was in the course of the
Oxford parliament that the

00:28:17.842 --> 00:28:20.730
incident took place in which the
King's mistress,

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.705
Nell Gwyn, the actress,
proceeding to Oxford in her

00:28:24.705 --> 00:28:29.029
coach in order to join the King,
found herself surrounded by an

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:32.009
angry mob who thought she was
the Duchess of Portsmouth,

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:35.529
another of Charles' mistresses
who happened to be a Catholic.

00:28:35.529 --> 00:28:38.122
Nell Gwyn was able to get the
crowd to leave her alone by

00:28:38.122 --> 00:28:40.157
opening the door,
showing herself and crying,

00:28:40.157 --> 00:28:41.640
"Be still,
good people.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.519
I am the Protestant whore."
 

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:47.798
&gt;
 

00:28:47.798 --> 00:28:51.473
Meanwhile, in Oxford,
the House of Commons still

00:28:51.473 --> 00:28:54.992
demanded the exclusion of James,
Duke of York,

00:28:54.992 --> 00:28:56.868
from the succession.
 

00:28:56.868 --> 00:29:02.773
Charles roundly declared that
he would not have it and he

00:29:02.773 --> 00:29:05.200
dissolved them again.
 

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.038
So what next?
 

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:12.576
Charles couldn't face another
parliament, but he decided to

00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:17.193
call the Whigs' bluff and to
brazen it out in the absence of

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:19.150
a sitting parliament.
 

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.580
He trusted in the possibility
that he might be able to rally

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.140
support in the political nation
at large,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.060
largely by appealing to Tory
sympathizers and partly by

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.636
playing on the widespread fears
that if this agitation continued

00:29:33.636 --> 00:29:36.470
it might lead to another
breakdown;

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.798
another '41.
 

00:29:39.798 --> 00:29:43.262
In April of 1681,
he issued a studiously moderate

00:29:43.262 --> 00:29:47.663
declaration of his position and
ordered that it should be read

00:29:47.663 --> 00:29:51.849
out from the pulpit of every
parish church in England;

00:29:51.849 --> 00:29:53.490
and so it was.
 

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.634
In his declaration the King
explained the basis of his

00:29:57.634 --> 00:30:02.558
principled conduct in defending
the legitimate succession to the

00:30:02.558 --> 00:30:03.420
throne.
 

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.124
He revived memories of the
breakdown in to civil war and

00:30:07.124 --> 00:30:10.693
how that war had led to the
abolition of the Church of

00:30:10.693 --> 00:30:14.848
England,
to military rulership and the

00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:21.410
subjugation of English liberties
and threats to property.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.538
And it worked.
 

00:30:23.538 --> 00:30:29.009
No parliament was sitting to
focus opposition to the King.

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:34.262
Agitation was gradually dying
down and Charles pressed his

00:30:34.262 --> 00:30:35.828
advantage hard.
 

00:30:35.828 --> 00:30:39.592
Titus Oates was arrested and
tried for perjury,

00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:43.190
found guilty,
his allegations declared false,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.380
and he was punished in the
pillory.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.888
The Earl of Shaftesbury,
leader of the Whigs,

00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:50.430
was indicted for treason.
 

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.380
He fled abroad where he shortly
died.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.789
Charles then began a systematic
program of calling in and

00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:03.201
remodeling the charters of
England's cities as a means of

00:31:03.201 --> 00:31:07.690
purging the corporations which
supported Whigs in national

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:12.574
politics and thereby rendering
the cities which elected members

00:31:12.574 --> 00:31:16.670
of parliament more politically
controllable.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.009
Between 1681 and 1685,
fifty-one cities had their

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:24.115
charters remodeled in this way
to make them more politically

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:28.436
manipulable;
forty-seven more were still in

00:31:28.436 --> 00:31:30.788
the pipeline in 1685.
 

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:34.714
Charles also permitted the
intensified prosecution of

00:31:34.714 --> 00:31:39.244
dissenters in order to satisfy
Anglican prejudices and to cow

00:31:39.244 --> 00:31:41.509
the dissenters themselves.
 

00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:46.670
The Quakers suffered especially
severely during the persecutions

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.390
of the early 1680s.
 

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:53.413
In 1683, with the discovery of
an alleged plot against the

00:31:53.413 --> 00:31:55.763
king,
the Rye House Plot,

00:31:55.763 --> 00:32:00.868
Whig radicals were arrested and
two leading Whig leaders,

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:04.509
Lord Russell and Algernon
Sidney, were brought to trial,

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:07.759
found guilty and executed.
 

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:12.106
Finally, in 1684 Charles
further consolidated his

00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:15.730
position by defying the
Triennial Act.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.038
Under the Triennial Act he
should have called a new

00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:20.559
parliament that year.
 

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.838
He didn't.
 

00:32:23.838 --> 00:32:29.874
So, Charles II had faced the
crisis of his reign at last,

00:32:29.874 --> 00:32:36.231
proven himself when stirred to
be politically pretty astute,

00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:38.279
and he had won.
 

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:42.130
In February 1685,
when the King was suddenly

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:47.593
incapacitated by a stroke and
then died after a short illness,

00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:50.368
he had never been stronger.
 

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:55.752
And it was on his death bed
that at last he found the

00:32:55.752 --> 00:33:01.653
propitious moment he had been
waiting for and converted to

00:33:01.653 --> 00:33:03.308
Catholicism.
 

00:33:03.308 --> 00:33:07.148
Well, Charles had won by
gambling that in the absence of

00:33:07.148 --> 00:33:10.848
a sitting parliament which could
focus opposition,

00:33:10.848 --> 00:33:15.910
no one could face the prospect
of armed rebellion against him;

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.028
no one could face a renewal of
civil war.

00:33:20.028 --> 00:33:23.769
He had consolidated his
position by appealing to the

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:28.242
fears and the prejudices of the
Tory-Anglican majority amongst

00:33:28.242 --> 00:33:33.134
the political nation at large,
and he had demonstrated that a

00:33:33.134 --> 00:33:37.940
Protestant authoritarianism was
not necessarily unacceptable to

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.180
those people.
 

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.483
It's interesting indeed to
speculate as to whether if James

00:33:43.483 --> 00:33:45.837
II,
Charles' successor,

00:33:45.837 --> 00:33:51.464
had continued to build up an
enhanced royal power on that

00:33:51.464 --> 00:33:54.791
basis,
whether England might have

00:33:54.791 --> 00:34:00.240
become a Protestant absolutist
state like Sweden or Denmark.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.288
Not impossible,
but we'll never know,

00:34:04.288 --> 00:34:07.281
because if Charles II had had a
lot in common with his

00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:10.358
grandfather,
James I, James II proved to be

00:34:10.358 --> 00:34:13.699
rather closer in temperament to
his father,

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.900
Charles I.
 

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.152
In a sense he was a better man
morally than his brother

00:34:20.152 --> 00:34:23.813
Charles,
but he also suffered far too

00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:28.090
much from energy,
coupled with a catastrophic

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.559
lack of political judgment.
 

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:34.610
James couldn't leave well alone.
 

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.929
Initially, his position was
very strong.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:42.717
His first parliament was Tory
dominated and it was willing to

00:34:42.717 --> 00:34:45.369
trust him despite his Roman
Catholicism.

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:48.940
Parliament was generous to him
indeed in its financial grants.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.291
And then in the summer of 1685
when Charles II's illegitimate

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:55.510
son,
the Duke of Monmouth,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.182
landed in the west of England,
raised a small army and claimed

00:35:00.182 --> 00:35:02.980
to be the legitimate heir to the
throne,

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.505
parliament quickly granted
James the resources for more

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:12.030
troops to head west and crush
the rebellion swiftly.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.239
And yet, despite this strength
in the first year of his reign,

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:22.342
in less than three years James
managed to undermine his own

00:35:22.342 --> 00:35:27.920
position with a quite staggering
comprehensiveness.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.820
The problem was,
of course, James' religion.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.300
It need not have been a
problem, but he made it one.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.422
He was a deeply sincere
Catholic with all of the zeal of

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:42.539
a convert.
 

00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:47.210
He probably didn't intend to
impose his religion coercively

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.702
upon the nation,
but he was certainly determined

00:35:50.702 --> 00:35:54.186
to remove the disabilities of
his co-religionists and to

00:35:54.186 --> 00:35:58.394
promote their interests,
and he doubtless hoped that

00:35:58.394 --> 00:36:03.896
with more widespread conversions
to Catholicism eventually the

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:09.309
nation would move back gradually
in a Catholic direction.

00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:13.440
These were not ignoble aims
from James' point of view,

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.030
but of course in the conditions
of late seventeenth-century

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.989
England they constituted gross
political folly,

00:36:21.989 --> 00:36:27.114
especially in the 1680s at a
time when King Louis XIV of

00:36:27.114 --> 00:36:32.704
France had recently revoked the
toleration previously granted

00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:37.550
under Richelieu to French
Protestants and England was

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:42.489
receiving thousands of
Protestant refugees from Louis'

00:36:42.489 --> 00:36:46.030
brutal persecutions in France.
 

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:51.342
What James needed if he was to
proceed with his intentions was

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:54.130
to get the Test Acts repealed.
 

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.909
Parliament clearly was not
willing to grant that,

00:36:57.909 --> 00:37:02.994
so James turned instead to his
use of his prerogative powers

00:37:02.994 --> 00:37:06.960
and in particular to his
'dispensing power'.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.938
Theoretically,
the king was permitted to

00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:14.748
dispense particular individuals
from the penalties of the law in

00:37:14.748 --> 00:37:19.101
special cases where rigid
enforcement of the letter of the

00:37:19.101 --> 00:37:22.079
law might result in an
injustice.

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:25.751
This prerogative power,
however, did not extend to

00:37:25.751 --> 00:37:29.875
authorizing acts which were
contrary to the law pure and

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:30.699
simple.
 

00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:35.699
It was meant for occasional use
in special cases.

00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:40.266
James' use of the dispensing
power showed a lack of respect

00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:45.070
for that distinction in the law
and was deeply provocative.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.563
Indeed, the manner in which it
was used was so provocative as

00:37:49.563 --> 00:37:52.409
to be almost farcical in
retrospect.

00:37:52.409 --> 00:37:56.373
One almost imagines that James
and his cabinet were meeting

00:37:56.373 --> 00:37:59.039
every morning and asking
themselves,

00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:01.666
"what can we do today
which will really upset

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:02.469
people?"
 

00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:04.820
&gt;
 

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.079
Let's have some Catholics in
the privy council;

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:09.510
four of them. Okay. Great.
 

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:13.353
How about making your Jesuit
confessor a member of the

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:14.079
cabinet?
 

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:15.130
Sweet.
 

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.400
&gt;
 

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.873
Let's make 250 Catholics
justices of the peace in the

00:38:20.873 --> 00:38:24.480
counties and displace their
Protestant predecessors.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.389
Wonderful idea.
 

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:30.840
Let's appoint Catholic officers
in the militia and the army.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.786
Let's appoint a Catholic Lord
Deputy of Ireland and allow him

00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:37.090
to re-catholicize the army
there.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.250
Let's make an Oxford College a
Catholic seminary.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:46.099
Wonderful ideas;
and he did it all.

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:50.407
Now James was not so stupid as
not to realize that this policy

00:38:50.407 --> 00:38:53.940
would be deeply alienating to
Anglican support,

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.923
but he thought that he could
counterbalance that by wooing

00:38:57.923 --> 00:39:00.719
support amongst Protestant
dissenters.

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:05.103
In April 1687,
he himself issued a Declaration

00:39:05.103 --> 00:39:08.121
of Indulgence,
like his brother,

00:39:08.121 --> 00:39:13.186
suspending the penal laws
against both dissenters and

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:15.329
Roman Catholics.
 

00:39:15.329 --> 00:39:18.547
In sum then,
the king's dispensing power was

00:39:18.547 --> 00:39:23.186
being exercised with a freedom
that was clearly turning it into

00:39:23.186 --> 00:39:26.030
an illegal suspension of the
law,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:31.239
the very thing which parliament
had declared against in 1673.

00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:36.619
And James appeared to be
forcing his base of support,

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:41.119
his natural allies amongst
Tories and staunch Anglicans,

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:47.092
he was forcing them to choose
between their loyalty to their

00:39:47.092 --> 00:39:51.039
church and their loyalty to the
King.

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:54.307
To make matters worse,
in 1687 James embarked upon

00:39:54.307 --> 00:39:57.842
what appeared to be a blatant
attempt to pack a future

00:39:57.842 --> 00:40:01.846
parliament for the purpose of
securing the repeal of the Test

00:40:01.846 --> 00:40:02.579
Acts.
 

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:06.804
All justices of peace in the
counties and members of urban

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:11.400
corporations for parliamentary
constituencies were asked by the

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.922
King to answer three questions
relating to whether or not they

00:40:15.922 --> 00:40:20.739
would support repeal of the Test
Acts in a new parliament,

00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:25.677
whether or not they would vote
for those who would support such

00:40:25.677 --> 00:40:29.420
a repeal if they were elected to
parliament,

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.507
and whether they would support
the new Declaration of

00:40:33.507 --> 00:40:34.530
Indulgence.
 

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.715
James could hardly have
signaled his intentions more

00:40:38.715 --> 00:40:41.873
clearly,
and by doing so he occasioned

00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:45.215
widespread alarm,
not just among Anglicans but

00:40:45.215 --> 00:40:49.146
also amongst the majority of the
dissenters whom he had been

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.280
trying to woo.
 

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:56.449
They were not disposed to trust
the King's good intentions.

00:40:56.449 --> 00:41:01.007
At this point anxieties was
perhaps only contained by

00:41:01.007 --> 00:41:06.179
expectations that this situation
might not last too long.

00:41:06.179 --> 00:41:10.353
King James was now fifty-five
years old, quite a good age for

00:41:10.353 --> 00:41:11.119
the time.
 

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:13.449
He still had no son.
 

00:41:13.449 --> 00:41:16.054
His eldest daughter,
Mary, his heir,

00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:20.150
was a Protestant and was
married to William of Orange in

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.639
the Netherlands.
 

00:41:21.639 --> 00:41:26.628
If the King were to die soon,
then they would surely succeed

00:41:26.628 --> 00:41:31.110
and it might well be the case
that toleration would be

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.505
achieved for Protestant
dissenters without empowering

00:41:35.505 --> 00:41:39.650
Roman Catholics in the way James
was doing.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.894
That may have been many
people's hope,

00:41:42.894 --> 00:41:47.367
but in the winter of 1687 and
the spring of 1688 two

00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:51.139
precipitants transformed the
situation.

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:53.891
First of all,
in November 1687,

00:41:53.891 --> 00:41:59.029
it became known that Queen Mary
was pregnant and that the

00:41:59.029 --> 00:42:01.690
pregnancy was going well.
 

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:06.570
James might then have a
Catholic heir if a son was born.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:12.003
Secondly, in April 1688 James
ordered his Declaration of

00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:17.239
Indulgence to be read out in all
Anglican churches.

00:42:17.239 --> 00:42:20.438
Seven bishops of the Church of
England, including the

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:23.882
Archbishop of Canterbury
himself, petitioned against this

00:42:23.882 --> 00:42:24.559
action.
 

00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:30.250
In reply they were indicted and
tried for sedition.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.492
The case of the Seven Bishops
turned on the legality of the

00:42:34.492 --> 00:42:38.880
use of the dispensing power by
the King and when it was heard

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.320
they were acquitted,
to widespread public rejoicing.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:51.054
And then, in June 1688 Queen
Mary was delivered of a child,

00:42:51.054 --> 00:42:55.119
a prince, the young Prince
James.

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:59.719
Rumors immediately began to
circulate that in fact the child

00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:04.632
was not the King's child but had
been smuggled in to the Queen's

00:43:04.632 --> 00:43:09.000
bedchamber secretly in a warming
pan in order to give the

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.289
appearance of the birth of an
heir to the throne.

00:43:13.289 --> 00:43:16.525
People were now so desperate
they were willing to believe

00:43:16.525 --> 00:43:19.070
stories of this kind,
or pretend they did.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.289
All of this persuaded seven
leading politicians,

00:43:22.289 --> 00:43:24.460
five of them Whigs,
two of them Tories,

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.400
including the Earl of Danby,
Charles' former chief minister,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.449
that it was time to do
something.

00:43:31.449 --> 00:43:36.177
This was the third "crisis
of popery and arbitrary

00:43:36.177 --> 00:43:40.820
power," and in June 1688
these seven leaders,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.190
who later became known as the
'Immortal Seven',

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.092
sent a letter to William of
Orange expressing their fear for

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:50.800
their liberties,
their religion,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.505
and their property and inviting
him to intervene to secure a

00:43:56.505 --> 00:44:01.148
free Parliament and to
investigate the suspicious

00:44:01.148 --> 00:44:05.210
circumstances of Prince James'
birth.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:10.585
William had in fact already
been anticipating the likelihood

00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:16.143
of renewed war with France in
1688 and he had made contingency

00:44:16.143 --> 00:44:20.789
plans for the possible invasion
of England if,

00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:26.748
as he expected,
James II supported Louis XIV of

00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:29.469
France against him.
 

00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:33.465
Louis was indeed ready to
support James in such an

00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:37.248
eventuality,
but the autumn of 1688 came and

00:44:37.248 --> 00:44:41.952
no one expected an invasion
later than that because of the

00:44:41.952 --> 00:44:46.409
prevalence of adverse winds in
the English Channel.

00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:50.699
By September 1688 then,
Louis of France considered

00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:55.777
himself free of that threat and
obligation and he moved his

00:44:55.777 --> 00:45:01.730
troops south in order to invade
the Palatinate in south Germany;

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.900
the first steps in a renewed
war.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:09.012
This freed William of Orange
from fear of an immediate French

00:45:09.012 --> 00:45:11.070
attack upon the Netherlands.
 

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.693
In October 1688,
he issued a declaration that he

00:45:14.693 --> 00:45:18.855
was coming over in order
"to preserve and maintain

00:45:18.855 --> 00:45:22.963
the established laws,
liberties and customs"

00:45:22.963 --> 00:45:27.250
of England and to investigate
the birth of the prince.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.710
On the 1^(st) of November,
he sailed and was carried down

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.293
the Channel by what was later
known as the "Protestant

00:45:34.293 --> 00:45:37.878
wind," a wind blowing
unusually in the right direction

00:45:37.878 --> 00:45:39.300
for his purposes.
 

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.503
He was carried down the channel
to land at Torbay in the west of

00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:47.641
England on the 5^(th) of
November 1688,

00:45:47.641 --> 00:45:49.789
a very propitious day.
 

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:54.791
Faced with this invasion,
King James initially joined his

00:45:54.791 --> 00:45:59.974
army at Salisbury in the West
Country but inexplicably lost

00:45:59.974 --> 00:46:03.280
his nerve and withdrew to
London.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.335
James was no coward,
he'd fought very bravely in his

00:46:06.335 --> 00:46:09.929
youth, but for some reason he
lost his nerve and withdrew.

00:46:09.929 --> 00:46:15.219
His army's leaders went over to
William and joined him.

00:46:15.219 --> 00:46:19.289
Risings also began to take
place in some provincial cities.

00:46:19.289 --> 00:46:25.525
The Earl of Danby for example
seized York with parties of the

00:46:25.525 --> 00:46:27.500
Yorkshire gentry.
 

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:32.588
At this point King James sent
his family abroad for safety and

00:46:32.588 --> 00:46:37.260
on the 11^(th) of December
himself attempted to flee,

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.182
throwing the great seal of
England into the river Thames

00:46:41.182 --> 00:46:45.461
before doing so in an effort to
paralyze the government which

00:46:45.461 --> 00:46:48.530
needed the great seal for
various acts.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.760
James was captured by a fishing
boat on his way out of England

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.920
and returned to London where he
was held in custody until the

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.179
20^(th) of December when he
again escaped,

00:47:00.179 --> 00:47:04.289
probably by collusion on the
part of William's supporters,

00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:07.409
who allowed him to escape.
 

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:09.619
Indeed his escape was vital.
 

00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:13.659
What would they have done if
James had stayed?

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:18.490
They'd have been back in the
position of 1648 of negotiations

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.860
with Charles I.
 

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:25.996
But with James gone the
political process could proceed

00:47:25.996 --> 00:47:27.929
in his absence.
 

00:47:27.929 --> 00:47:31.510
He was allowed to escape to
France,

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:37.090
and on the 24^(th) of December
1688 an assembly of the nobility

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:42.489
asked William and Mary to take
up the reins of government.

00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:46.902
The way was prepared for a
refashioning of government which

00:47:46.902 --> 00:47:51.161
was to proceed over the next two
decades and which was to

00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:54.130
transform the British
constitution.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:58.420
But I'll return to that after
the break.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.181
Next time we need to look at
some other developments which

00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:03.750
were taking place in the late
seventeenth century,

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.500
the extraordinary economic
growth of that period.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:13.000

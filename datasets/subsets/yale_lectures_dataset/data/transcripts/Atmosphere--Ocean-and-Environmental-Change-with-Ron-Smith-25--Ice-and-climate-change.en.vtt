00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.133
RONALD SMITH: I put the
word--

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.833
the number seven billion
there because

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:06.800
according to what I read in the
newspaper, this was the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.900
weekend where the world's
population just increased past

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.967
seven billion.

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:16.733
So it's kind of an important
day in terms of world

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.900
population.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.367
I'm going to talk about
population a little bit a week

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.033
or two from now when we're
talking about global warming

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.933
issues and environmental
issues.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:32.167
But every scientist who's looked
at this issue would

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:39.767
probably define the holding
capacity of the planet, in

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.233
other words the number of people
that could live here

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.033
sustainably.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.200
Everyone would define it
differently depending on how

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.333
they do the calculation.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.067
My guess would be that the
holding capacity of the

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.967
planet's probably about
half that number.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.767
Probably about three
or four billion.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:03.433
Now, I may be way off on that,
but by my estimate we've long

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:08.000
since shot past the holding
capacity, which means that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.533
we're basically using
up resources

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.533
that cannot be renewed.

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:19.200
So eventually something will
have to adjust either a very

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.267
different kind of living or
come down to a different

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:24.633
population.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:29.767
Anyway, it's a troublesome
number.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:30.600
What else?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.167
Ah well we got to experience
our first nor'easter.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.800
It was quite exciting.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.667
Of course, one of the remarkable
things about these

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:43.133
storms, they come up the coast,
but they end up mixing

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.867
warm and cold air.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:48.900
So you get the warm air coming
from the south with lots of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.233
water vapor being lifted,
producing lots of

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.033
precipitation.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:56.200
And yet the cold air comes down
from the north, from the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.733
west side of the storm, wraps
around, and allows you to keep

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:04.000
that snow, which was formed
aloft by the ice phase

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.200
mechanism, allows you to
keep it as snow all

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.267
the way to the ground.

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:10.900
So even in this time of the
season, which is generally not

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.733
so cold, we had pretty good
snowfalls because the cold air

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.500
down from Canada allowed that
snow to keep as snow as it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.367
fell all the way
to the ground.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:23.500
The unusual thing about it was
it was a little bit earlier

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.867
than we typically have
nor'easters.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.500
And that combined with the fact
that as the last 20 or 30

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.167
years have gone by, we've gotten
warming in New England,

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:38.300
which has kept the leaves
on the trees later

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300
and later in later.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.533
So in my recollection, this was
the first real nor'easter

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.800
that's come while all of the,
or most of the leaves were

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.900
still on the trees.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.133
20 years ago, the leaves
were off the trees

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.367
easily two weeks ago.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:59.000
Mid-October everything was down,
and now we still have

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.567
the leaves and now we get
our first nor'easter.

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:06.633
So it's a subtle indication,
maybe not so subtle, that

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.867
things are changing when you
can get a nor'easter coming

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:12.167
while the leaves are
still on the trees.

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:12.800
Interesting.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.667
Any comments on that?

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.600
Anybody get out and try
skiing in the snow?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.567
It was very wet, wasn't it?

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:24.967
So more of a sloppy snow
than anything else.

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:30.367
Any questions before we
get started today?

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.000
OK.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.833
Well we had a little bit
to finish up on our

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:39.000
discussion of ice.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.467
We hadn't quite finished the
mountain glacier section, so

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:43.567
I've gone going back
to this first

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:47.000
diagram from that section.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.733
I wanted to remind you
about the definition

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:51.867
of a tidewater glacier.

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:57.433
That's when a glacier comes down
to the sea so that pieces

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:02.033
can break off and
form icebergs.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.367
And some, of course, don't
get down that far.

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:08.633
Maybe I'll get the lights
off for this.

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:19.967
An interesting set of glaciers
is the North and South

00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:24.667
Patagonian Icefields down
in the Southern Andes.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.200
The North Patagonian Ice Sheet
is here, the Southern one is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.900
here, it's larger.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.000
And many of them actually calve
off their glaciers in

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.933
these big lakes to the
east into Argentina.

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:40.233
So if you were to go down there
and sign on to a tourist

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:43.867
boat that would take you up to
the calving glaciers, they

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:47.400
would be in these lakes for the
most part, rather than in

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.933
the fjords coming in from
the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:52.700
So that's kind of an
interesting place.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.900
But remember, they're calving
in fresh water there.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.433
They're not really-so I guess
I wouldn't really call them

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:02.600
tidewater glaciers, although you
could argue it either way.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.300
They're calving into water,
but it's fresh water lakes

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.933
rather than seawater
with tides.

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:15.800
Flying over it, you get to see
these snow-covered mountains,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.800
you get to see some of the ice
breaking up into crevasses as

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.433
they begin to flow
over a bend.

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:27.400
Wherever they've got a drop
over a sudden break in the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.200
slope, they often break up into
these deep crevasses.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.967
And of course, they're covered
with snow, but if you were to

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:41.000
fall into that, you fall down 50
or 100 meters and be lost.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.533
But you can see the flow
streaks, these medial moraines

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:48.533
follow it down to where
the calving occurs.

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:50.633
It's a bad picture
from an aircraft.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:53.133
There's a lake there and
the icebergs are

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:54.367
calving into the lake.

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:58.533
You see it here as well.

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:03.433
You see these various moraines,
medial moraines

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:05.867
going down and then they
break off into the

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.667
little lake down there.

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:16.133
Now, there's been a trend in the
amount of ice in mountain

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:19.100
glaciers, and it's negative
most places.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.833
This shows a number of different
parts around the

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.267
world where you've got mountain
glaciers, and it's

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:29.800
kept track of their
mass since 1960.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.333
The units here are meters
of water equivalent.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:37.300
So it's not how deep the snow or
the ice is on the glacier,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.100
but if you were to melt
it into liquid how

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.700
deep it would be.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.533
That's a convenient reference
because snow can be of

00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:49.100
different densities, and even
compacted snow, depending on

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.933
how tight it's been compacted,
may not reach the

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.267
full density of ice.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:57.000
So for this kind of mass balance
calculation, it's more

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.200
convenient to, in the end,
describe it as a loss in a

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.733
depth of water equivalent.

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:08.167
A little bit hard to follow the
colors, but in Patagonia

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:11.633
where I was just pointing, we've
had some of the largest

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:17.000
drops, 35 meters of water
equivalent, a decrease in the

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.233
thickness of those mountain
glaciers.

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:21.800
Alaska and the coast
mountains have

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.500
decreased rapidly as well.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.200
And the Northwestern USA, for
example, Glacier National

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.167
Park, named after its glaciers,
is having one of the

00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:36.067
most rapid decreases.

00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:39.167
The word there is if you want to
see the glaciers in Glacier

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.333
National Park you better go
there in the next five years

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:46.867
because they're diminishing
pretty rapidly.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.467
However, there are some
glaciers that are not

00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:50.200
changing very much.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.633
For example, in the arctic, and
again, I'm not sure of the

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:57.333
color codes here, but it looks
like Europe and the Andean

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:02.733
glaciers this would be the
Southern Andes, this would be

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:06.433
the rest of the Central Andes
they are not changing so

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:10.333
dramatically, at least not
until the last few years.

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:15.433
So it's a mixed story, but
mostly strongly negative for

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:18.667
the trends on those
mountain glaciers.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:21.400
To wrap-up I wanted to go back
and look at Greenland.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.500
We've already talked about it
a little bit, but just to

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.767
summarize some of the
changes that are

00:08:25.767 --> 00:08:27.233
occurring in Greenland.

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:31.067
Here are some of the glaciers
coming off of the main

00:08:31.067 --> 00:08:34.933
Greenland Ice sheet as a
function of time from 2000

00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:37.700
till almost the present day.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.467
We looked at the Jakobshaven
one.

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:43.100
We've spent some time
talking about those.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.333
I haven't shown you
the other ones.

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.633
Oh, I did show you the
Petermann up in the

00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:49.900
northwestern part.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.567
For the most part these
are negative.

00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:54.667
Some very strongly negative,
some not so strongly.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.867
But generally the glaciers
are retreating.

00:08:58.867 --> 00:09:01.900
This is in units of
square kilometers.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.900
So the base of it, it's not
keeping track of thickness

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.700
now, but the area
as it decreases.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.000
Generally negative.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.667
And we saw Petermann's
glacier.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:17.400
So when that drops off, they
decrease the area estimate of

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.800
the Petermann glacier.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.333
And some would argue well that's
not a significant loss

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.600
because that'll refill
eventually, but that's how

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.000
they've done the calculation.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.200
And then we looked at
Jakobshaven before and saw

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.733
that its calving front was
retreating with time as well,

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:36.967
and that shows up on
the time plot also.

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:39.233
Now, there's another thing
we can investigate about

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:43.900
Greenland, and that is the
amount of surface area up on

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.300
the ice sheet that has
meltwater in the

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.533
middle of the summer.

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:53.733
And what's shown--so you can
fly a satellite over, look

00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:57.700
down, and by the way light
reflects off the ice sheet,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.667
you could determine whether or
not the snow is wet whether

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:07.400
it's got meltwater mixed
in with the snow.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:18.733
And in 1992 the pale area was
shown to have melt water in

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:19.567
the warm season.

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:23.333
And now, 2005, even this
deeper red area.

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:26.500
It's only the diminishing white
area that is free of

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.767
melt water, and that's an
indication that the climate is

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.500
changing as well.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.967
What happens to that melt water,
some of it just stays

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.900
there and refreezes
the next winter.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:42.800
Some of it runs off in this
rather remarkable called a

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.500
moulin, which is basically a
hole that develops in the ice

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.433
sheet that allows surface waters
that are melting in the

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:56.500
summer to drain and fall
a distance of perhaps a

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.633
kilometer or so down to the
base of the glacier.

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:02.300
And then it'll flow along
the base of the

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.800
glacier out to the sea.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.000
So this is an example of
one of those moulins.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.100
Up on the Greenland ice sheet,
water then draining down into

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.700
this hole that takes it down to
the bottom of the glacier.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.233
Any questions on that?

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:20.100
It's a summertime, of course.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.600
Recently we've got a new
technology to keep track of

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.800
what's happening to Greenland
and other

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.033
things around the world.

00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:34.567
It's called the GRACE satellite,
and maybe you can

00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:36.167
make out the acronym here.

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:38.867
Gravity Recovery And
Climate Experiment.

00:11:38.867 --> 00:11:41.067
That's GRACE.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:47.200
And it consists of two
satellites moving around the

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.533
planet very close to each other
with a laser beam going

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:57.100
from one to the other doing
accurate laser ranging.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.667
So you know within a millimeter
or so the distance

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:05.767
between those two satellites
as they move.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:12.067
Well, as the Earth is not
uniform in its density, the

00:12:12.067 --> 00:12:16.200
continents have mass, other
things have mass

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.333
concentrations that make the
gravity field of the planet a

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.533
little bit irregular.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:25.133
And by sending a satellite
around that feels that

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:28.600
gravity, and keeping track of
how the distance between the

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.700
two satellites varies during
the orbit, they can map out

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.067
these gravitational anomalies
around the

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:37.200
surface of the Earth.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.733
And this is an exaggerated what
they've done is take a

00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:48.700
globe, and in three dimensions
kind of made it nobly so that

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.767
it shows you where the higher
mass concentrations are.

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:57.467
So this kind of irregular
gravity field is what GRACE

00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:59.733
can detect as it goes around.

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:02.300
Now that satellit's all that's
been in orbit for a few years

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.400
now, and one of the applications
of it is to look

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.167
at not just the gravity
concentrations near Greenland,

00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:12.067
but how they've been
changing in time.

00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:14.833
That's what shown
in this diagram.

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:18.533
So two plots are shown, one for
Southeast Greenland, that

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.700
would be this area here.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.833
The other for Northwest
Greenland up here.

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:28.567
The time runs from 2002 to
2010, and this is the

00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:35.033
centimeter of water equivalent
thickness removed from,

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:38.000
ormissing from that part
of Greenland over

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.400
that period of time.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.967
And for Southeast Greenland,
putting a straight line

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.167
through there, you get about
minus eight centimeters per

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:48.900
year of water equivalent loss.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.233
And for Northwest Greenland
it's about minus seven

00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:53.200
centimeters per year.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.133
So the two values are
roughly consistent.

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.900
That tells you that the overall
mass of the Greenland

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.500
ice sheet is decreasing.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.833
You can do calculations with
these numbers and figure out

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.700
how long it would take before it
would all be lost. It'd be

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.800
quite a number of years because
these ice layers are

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.900
quite thick, a kilometer
or more.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.000
But nevertheless, it
represents quite

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.067
a bit of mass loss.

00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:21.133
And when that water melts and
goes into the sea, of course,

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:24.833
that raises sea level
a little bit.

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:27.633
And that's a calculation
you can do as well.

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:31.600
If you know the area of
Greenland and how much this is

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.267
decreasing per unit time, you
can use the surface area of

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:38.800
the oceans to compute how
much that is going

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.833
to raise sea level.

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:42.067
Any questions on that?

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.367
Well that's the end of the story
on modern ice, current

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:51.100
ice on the planet.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.133
We could take a few minutes if
there are any questions about

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:57.267
any of the things that I've
covered with regards to ice in

00:14:57.267 --> 00:14:58.500
the climate system.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:01.600
Anything?

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.133
Yeah, Julia.

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:03.400
Student: So glaciers are always

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.100
associated with mountains?

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.700
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.700
I would say the word glacier
usually implies moving ice.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.233
Moving gravitationally.

00:15:13.233 --> 00:15:18.767
So if you've got an ice sheet
like Greenland, and through

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:23.700
the gaps, like here and here,
where the ice can squeeze out

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.700
and come down to sea level,
that would be a glacier.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.467
You wouldn't refer to
this as a glacier.

00:15:29.467 --> 00:15:30.933
This is an ice sheet.

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:33.600
But where it's squeezing and
flowing down to sea level,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.433
that would be a glacier.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:38.267
Or if you have a mountain
glacier, a small mountain

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:41.400
glacier with sliding
gravitationally, that would be

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.633
a glacier as well.

00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:47.100
So just don't use it with
respect to a large ice sheet

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.533
and you'll be safe on the
terminology side of things.

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:52.800
Other questions on this?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:06.400
Well we're going to shift
gears a little bit.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.267
We're going to talk about
how climate has been

00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:40.033
changing with time.

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.300
And for this you should
be reading

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.233
Chapter 13 in your book.

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:47.033
The author of the textbook has
done a good job with 13.

00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:50.300
He's made a little different set
of choices than I've made

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.133
about what to emphasize.

00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:56.333
But I think the combination of
the two, Chapter 13 in Ahrens,

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:59.633
and my presentation here today,
and this'll spill over

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:04.267
into Wednesday, will give you a
good introduction to how the

00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:07.967
climate is changing
on the Earth.

00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:10.033
I've made a decision to
focus on the last

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:13.333
five million years.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:14.900
And the reason for that
well there are really

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.867
three reasons for that.

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:20.833
One is the continents have
pretty much been in their

00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:24.533
present position for the last
five million years.

00:17:24.533 --> 00:17:26.933
So we don't have to
worry about the

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:28.367
continents moving around.

00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:34.400
Second of all, this has been
the period of time in our

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.500
planet when humans have been
evolving to our current form.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.833
So it's not so distant in the
past that we're not engaged in

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.700
it as a species.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.967
This is a period of time when
we have been coming on to,

00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:55.033
evolving to our present form.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:18:00.933
And I guess third, we're
looking for a period of

00:18:00.933 --> 00:18:04.300
geologic history where there's
been significant change in

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.800
climate in order to make the
subject interesting.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.733
But also, one of the reasons for
studying past climates is

00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:17.867
to provide a context for
future climate change.

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:20.933
And to provide a good context
for future climate change, you

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.300
would like to look at a period
of Earth history that had

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.500
significant climate change.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.533
And we certainly have it over
the last five million years.

00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:33.100
So that's the reason why I've
decided to focus just on the

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.700
last five million years.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.067
There's a number of
subcategories or subjects I'm

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:41.733
going to be treating
today and tomorrow.

00:18:41.733 --> 00:18:46.300
Today we'll probably only get
through maybe the first two or

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.033
three of these.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:53.200
We're going to start with a
brief overview of the climate

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.067
of the last five
million years.

00:18:57.067 --> 00:18:57.767
How many of you--remind
me, how many have

00:18:57.767 --> 00:19:01.200
had a geology course?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.567
Just a few of you.

00:19:02.567 --> 00:19:05.200
So you know something about
this time scale, and I've

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.967
mentioned it once or twice
before as well.

00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:11.067
This is the geologic
time scale.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:15.867
The Earth is something like five
or six billion years old.

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:17.800
This goes almost back
to that level.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.700
The Precambrian is where we
didn't have life in the form

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.200
that would leave a
fossil record.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.267
Nothing with bones or shells
or anything like that.

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:32.733
There was life there, and
there's certain types of

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:35.733
physical fossils that are
left, but not the actual

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:37.500
remains of the organisms.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.767
Then you go through a series of
rapid evolution as you come

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:43.100
up through to the
present time.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.867
We're not going to talk
about dinosaurs.

00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:47.133
The dinosaurs died out
right about there.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.967
Probably with an impact from
a large meteorite.

00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:56.700
Instead we're going
to focus just on

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.100
these last three periods.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.067
The Pliocene, the Pleistocene,
and Holocene, taking us from

00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:06.000
approximately five million
years up to the present.

00:20:08.867 --> 00:20:13.000
I showed you this plate
tectonics diagram once before,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.567
coming up in time newer, newer,
newer, and newer.

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:20.833
This takes us to the Cretaceous,
which is here, 65

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:22.133
million years ago.

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:25.667
We're jumping up now factor
of 10 younger than that.

00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:28.333
So pretty much the continents
are going to be in their

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:32.500
current state for this last
five million years.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.933
So we don't have to worry
about any of this.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:38.233
If a continent has a record of
a different climate, it's not

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:41.133
because it was at a different
latitude.

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:44.600
It's because the climate was
actually different on Earth at

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.800
that time, not just the
continents sliding around

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.067
under the climate zones.

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:54.133
Questions there?

00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:54.567
All right.

00:20:54.567 --> 00:21:00.400
So just a few words about
these three periods.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:06.667
The mid-Pliocene, 3.3 to three
million years before present,

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:10.900
similar common locations today,
but a significantly

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.567
higher global temperature, maybe
two to three degrees

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:18.300
Celsius for the average
global temperature.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.067
Much more remarkable than that,
though, was that the

00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:25.700
high latitudes were much warmer
than they are today.

00:21:30.733 --> 00:21:33.600
There was a little bit of
ice on Greenland, but

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.933
not a real ice sheet.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.500
Because of that lack of ice, sea
level was about 25 meters

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.500
higher than it is today.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.067
And for these reasons, there is
quite a flurry of research

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:56.200
going on right now about the
Pliocene, because it's a

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.467
possible analog for what the
Earth will be like about 100

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:04.533
years from now with
global warming.

00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:06.133
I'm going to talk about global
warming next week.

00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:10.233
But this has really excited a
lot of interest, this idea

00:22:10.233 --> 00:22:15.100
that maybe there was a period
in the past we could look at

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.667
to see our future in a sense.

00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:22.067
Now whether that turns out to be
an accurate analog, I would

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:24.633
say remains to be seen.

00:22:24.633 --> 00:22:26.900
But that's one of the reasons
why there's so much current

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.467
activity about the Pliocene.

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:30.800
Yes?

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.100
Student: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.867
PROFESSOR: So a million years
before present.

00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:38.567
A million years before
present.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:48.767
These are some of the mammals
we had in the Pliocene era.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:56.133
Saber-toothed tiger and
the woolly mammoth.

00:22:56.133 --> 00:22:57.433
As I say, no dinosaurs.

00:22:57.433 --> 00:23:01.100
That was 60 million years ago.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.433
The Pliocene vegetation now,
there's no legend on this

00:23:03.433 --> 00:23:08.100
diagram, but the author wanted
to make the point that the

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.467
normal forests that we have here
at mid-latitudes, at that

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:14.800
time extended all the way up
into the Canadian archipelago

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.167
up into Alaska.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:21.633
Areas that are now tundra had
forests very much like the

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:24.833
ones we have here
in Connecticut.

00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:27.700
So it really was a period of
time when temperatures were

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.567
much warmer at the higher
latitudes than they are today.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.033
Then we'll jump to the
Pleistocene, which is 2.6

00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:49.567
million years ago up to
just 12,000 years ago.

00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:51.800
One of the problems with
Paleoclimatology is we've got

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.900
to deal with these vast
stretches of time.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.633
It's a little bit hard sometimes
to conceive of how

00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:03.300
long ago that was and
how recent this was.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.533
But we'll be working on that
today and next time trying to

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:09.800
give you all a better
understanding on how these

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.400
time scales work.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.433
The Pleistocene was possibly
the coldest period in Earth

00:24:16.433 --> 00:24:21.300
history, although there have
been discussions of periods of

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.833
time hundreds of millions
of years ago that

00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:26.867
may have been colder.

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:31.167
But at least in recent Earth
history, in the last, say, 100

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:35.467
million years or even 200
million years, probably this

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:41.033
was the coldest period in that
part of Earth history.

00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:44.867
As we'll see, there were lower
carbon dioxide concentrations

00:24:44.867 --> 00:24:48.400
in the atmosphere than
there are today.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.000
And throughout this two and a
half million year period,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.533
there were periodic advances and
retreats of ice sheets and

00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:58.200
mountain glaciers.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:05.500
So it wasn't a single ice age,
in a sense it was a large

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.467
number of ice ages with warm--

00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:13.100
brief warm spells in between.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.267
If you averaged, however, it
certainly was a very cold

00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:18.567
period of time.

00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:22.200
Surprising, because we just
came out of the Pliocene,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.900
which was warmer than
it is today.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.900
Then we go into the Pleistocene,
which was much

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.733
colder, and then we're going
to bounce back out and talk

00:25:29.733 --> 00:25:31.433
about modern climate.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.333
I've written here Milankovitch
pacing because the advance and

00:25:37.333 --> 00:25:43.333
retreat of these ice sheets
seems to have been controlled

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.433
by slight adjustments in the
Earth's orbital parameters.

00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:51.467
The so-called Milankovitch
theory of climate change, and

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:54.467
I'll talk about that.

00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:58.033
And this period of time, 2.6 to
the present, includes most

00:25:58.033 --> 00:26:05.200
of human evolution, at least the
species that have homo in

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.600
front of them, as I'll show
you in just a minute.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.733
And the Last Glacial Maximum,
the last of these ice sheet

00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:17.600
advances, was about 14,000
years before present.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.700
And it was just after that that
I'll take the official

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.233
end of the Pleistocene period.

00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:29.167
So I'm kind of defining the end
of it as being the end of

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:31.567
the last glacial advance.

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:39.033
Here is a diagram showing
human evolution.

00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:42.300
There's a time scale up there
in millions of years ago.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.067
So here is today, one million,
two million, three

00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:47.467
million years ago.

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:54.400
The prefix A, Australopithecus
is on these brown species

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.367
indicators.

00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:59.033
And then you get to the homo
prefix, and that really takes

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:01.400
you from two million years
up to the present.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.133
Homosapiens, however, are only
in the last couple of hundred

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:07.900
thousand years.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:14.033
So climatologically then, the
Pleistocene goes from about

00:27:14.033 --> 00:27:22.967
here to about there, getting a
little bit of Homosapiens in

00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:30.000
it, and most of the other
ancestors of modern man.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.333
So be sure you have some
understanding of this when

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:36.167
we're thinking about
paleoclimate so you can make

00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:39.833
the necessary connections
between human evolution and

00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:41.933
the change in climate.

00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:43.167
Any questions on that?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.600
If there's any anthropology
majors or people who have had

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.433
an anthropology course, keep
me honest on these things.

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:57.367
I'm not much of an expert on
human evolution, but don't

00:27:57.367 --> 00:27:59.733
feel afraid to speak
out if I say

00:27:59.733 --> 00:28:01.100
something wrong about that.

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.800
I'm going to come back to this
diagram later on, but it suits

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.067
the present purpose as well.

00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:14.800
It happens to be data from a
Vostok ice core, and I will

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.633
describe later how this data is
gathered and interpreted.

00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:24.100
But for the time being let's
take it at face value.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.500
Here's a plot of temperature
change from present, from the

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.167
present day back to
400,000 years ago.

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:40.500
So here is today, and of course
by definition, present

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.733
change--temperature change from
present, that's right

00:28:42.733 --> 00:28:46.467
about zero, because here's
the present day.

00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:50.167
About 10,000 years ago and
earlier, we were in a much

00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:51.733
colder period of time.

00:28:51.733 --> 00:28:54.867
That's the last glacial
period.

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:58.000
Then there was another brief
interglacial period, about

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.933
130,000 years ago.

00:28:59.933 --> 00:29:03.367
Then a long glacial period,
another brief

00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:05.633
interglacial, and so on.

00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:10.000
So when I talk about the
Pleistocene as being a period

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.733
of ice advances and retreats
and significant climate

00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:16.800
change, this is what
I'm talking about.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.933
On average it was much colder
than the present day.

00:29:19.933 --> 00:29:25.400
Typically four or five or six
degrees Celsius colder than

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.000
the present day.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.767
But there were other
interglacials.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.933
There are other brief
periods of warmth.

00:29:31.933 --> 00:29:36.400
We're in one today, and about
every 100,000, 125,000

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.700
thousand years back through this
record, there was another

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.667
brief interglacial.

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:44.700
That will give you a sense for
what I mean by this great

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.933
variability that occurred within
the Pleistocene period.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.933
At the Last Glacial Maximum,
in other words, right about

00:29:55.933 --> 00:30:00.600
here, about 20,000 years ago,
although you could take it a

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.267
little more recent than that,
LGM, is the abbreviation for

00:30:06.267 --> 00:30:09.700
Last Glacial Maximum, this
was the distribution of

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.167
continental ice sheets.

00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:15.000
It doesn't show Antarctica, but
Antarctica still had its

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.967
full ice sheet at that
time, and Greenland.

00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:23.000
But now look, in addition,
you've got an even larger ice

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.933
sheet over North America
called the

00:30:24.933 --> 00:30:27.833
Laurentide ice sheet.

00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:30.967
And then a large one up over
Scandinavia and Northern

00:30:30.967 --> 00:30:32.433
Russia as well.

00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:39.367
So the number, or the aerial
extent of large continental

00:30:39.367 --> 00:30:45.167
ice sheets was much larger
14,000, 15,000, 20,000 years

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:48.167
ago than it is today
at the end of the

00:30:48.167 --> 00:30:51.300
Last Glacial Maximum.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.033
So really a dramatically
different climate

00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:55.233
then we have today.

00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:57.667
This has been one of the biggest
paradigm shifts in the

00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:02.333
Earth sciences in the last
200 years was to convince

00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:04.833
ourselves, other scientists,
and finally the general

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:09.233
public, that this recent
period was so different

00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:11.667
climatologically than
the one today.

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:14.367
If you go back and read the
scientific literature from the

00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:18.900
period 1900, 1910, 1920, there
were violent arguments in the

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.233
scientific literature about
whether this could really be

00:31:21.233 --> 00:31:25.100
true, that this short time ago
there could have been massive

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.200
ice sheets over the
continents.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.800
Now we're certain it's true.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.967
We have many, many lines of
evidence that convinced us of

00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:37.267
that, but it was quite a
big deal at the time.

00:31:37.267 --> 00:31:40.700
Then the third geologic period
that I want you to be familiar

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.100
with is the Holocene.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.300
This is defined as a period
from 12,000 years before

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.467
present to the present day.

00:31:51.933 --> 00:31:54.367
It is a current interglacial
period.

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:59.567
In other words, the current
non-glacial period.

00:31:59.567 --> 00:32:02.633
It has modern humans, so
development of agriculture, a

00:32:02.633 --> 00:32:07.167
nearly constant climate, and
nearly steady sea level during

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:08.767
that period of time.

00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:13.800
So if you're looking for a
reference point from which to

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.633
consider or compute climate
change, this

00:32:18.633 --> 00:32:20.867
is a possible candidate.

00:32:20.867 --> 00:32:24.900
Now, it's only 12,000 years,
but still, that's quite a

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.633
large time.

00:32:25.633 --> 00:32:29.100
And for some purposes, that
might be a good reference

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.000
point for defining
climate change.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.933
But be careful, not everyone
will agree with you on that.

00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:39.867
Some people might say no, you
want to, perhaps, go back a

00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:43.400
much longer period of time and
integrate over all of those

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.000
fluctuations in the Pleistocene,
or maybe even

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.500
include part of the
Pliocene in your

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.233
definition of a normal climate.

00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:56.600
This will haunt us, this idea of
what would be the usual or

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.733
the normal climate.

00:32:57.733 --> 00:33:00.933
It's almost an unanswerable
question.

00:33:00.933 --> 00:33:05.000
Climate has changed so
dramatically over geologic

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.800
history that it's real hard to
find the time that you could

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.867
consider normal.

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:14.067
This might be the best
chance for that.

00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:15.300
Questions there?

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:21.567
OK so there we have the
Pliocene, the Pleistocene, and

00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:25.833
the Holocene, at least a brief
introduction to those.

00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:29.233
Oh, here's a plot of the
Holocene temperatures.

00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:31.667
This is thousands of years
before present, so this goes

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:34.733
back to 12,000 years, which is
the beginning of the Holocene.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.133
Temperature--there's a lot of
different proxies that are

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:43.100
considered here, and they all
give somewhat different

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.767
interpretations of
past climates.

00:33:45.767 --> 00:33:48.367
But if we take a look at the
thick black curve, which is

00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:51.400
the average of all of the
different proxies, here we are

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.433
coming out of the last ice age,
reaching a value about

00:33:55.433 --> 00:33:58.533
10,000 years ago, which remains
roughly constant till

00:33:58.533 --> 00:34:00.600
the present day.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.167
However, these fluctuations
have excited a lot of

00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:04.267
discussion.

00:34:04.267 --> 00:34:07.233
For example, this slightly
warmer period here is often

00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:11.600
referred to as the Climatic
Optimum between about 8,000

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.433
and 5,000 years ago.

00:34:15.433 --> 00:34:19.633
So some would argue when I say
that the the Holocene climate

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:20.700
was constant.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.733
It wasn't exactly constant.

00:34:22.733 --> 00:34:25.033
There were some fluctuations
within it.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.333
So that's step one, getting
those three time periods out

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.633
on the table.

00:34:35.633 --> 00:34:37.933
There's lots of paleoclimate
methods.

00:34:37.933 --> 00:34:40.300
We're not going to have time
to talk about these.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.000
But I want to spend the rest
of the period today talking

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.667
about geomorphology.

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:47.533
That is looking at
the landscape

00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:50.733
to deduce past climates.

00:34:50.733 --> 00:34:52.533
In a way this is the
most fun because

00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:54.167
we can do it ourselves.

00:34:54.167 --> 00:34:57.067
As we drive around the country,
look out the car

00:34:57.067 --> 00:35:02.600
window, we can begin to see
these landscape features that

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.100
can be interpreted as evidence
of climate change.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.567
So I want to spend quite a bit
of time on this because it's

00:35:08.567 --> 00:35:10.533
the one that we can
really have fun

00:35:10.533 --> 00:35:13.133
with and do it ourselves.

00:35:13.133 --> 00:35:15.900
I'm going to focus on surface
evidence of the Pleistocene

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.833
ice ages, and look particularly
at these five

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:21.067
geomorphologic features.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:30.967
A terminal moraine is that pile
of debris that marks the

00:35:30.967 --> 00:35:33.367
end of a glacier.

00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:37.333
Remember, a glacier is moving,
carrying material along

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.033
underneath it, melting
at the front.

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:43.600
So it's like a conveyor belt.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.900
It's bringing material and then
the glacier leaves, but

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.333
the material piles up.

00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:57.333
So if a glacier has a fixed
terminus for a number of

00:35:57.333 --> 00:36:04.100
decades, it will build up a pile
of rubble, rock, and soil

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.133
at the end of it.

00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:10.567
And then if that glacier were
to retreat, you'd have no

00:36:10.567 --> 00:36:14.233
glacier here, but you would
have that terminal moraine

00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:18.400
left as a marker, as evidence
of where that glacier was.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.267
So that's the importance of
the terminal moraine.

00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:24.967
It shows you where the previous
end of a glacier was,

00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:27.900
if it was there at least for
several decades or a few

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.600
hundred years.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.967
Here's one, here's a mountain
glacier coming down into a

00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:38.200
lake, and here at the other end
is the terminal moraine.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.267
So at an earlier time, this
glacier filled in the lake and

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:45.800
ended right there, and the
debris it was carrying

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.867
underneath it piled up
to form that moraine.

00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:53.233
So we see it today, we can say
ah, that glacier has retreated

00:36:53.233 --> 00:36:57.133
because it's snout used to be
right there at that location.

00:36:57.133 --> 00:36:59.800
That's the beauty of the
terminal moraine.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.100
It gives you this recent history
of how far the glacier

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.367
had extended.

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.633
For scale, here's a fellow
standing on top of a pile of

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:13.500
rubber--of rubble, rather.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.400
The glacier's nowhere
to be seen, it's

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.767
retreated up the valley.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:22.900
But this is where the snout
of that the glacier was.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.433
Now, there's some other things
that happens underneath a

00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:28.833
large ice sheet that get
revealed when the ice finally

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.400
melts and moves back.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.167
Well, OK, I've said it
wrong, didn't I?

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.900
Moved back.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.033
A glacier never moves back.

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:45.800
It's terminus may retreat, but
the glacier, the ice itself,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.100
is either stationary or
is moving forward.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.567
When you go into a warm period
and the glaciers retreat, they

00:37:53.567 --> 00:37:57.533
never do it by sliding that
glacier back up the valley.

00:37:57.533 --> 00:37:59.233
Be very clear on that.

00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:03.633
It's only that the apparent
end of it may

00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:04.867
seem to move back.

00:38:04.867 --> 00:38:08.333
But the ice will continue to be
flowing from left to right

00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:13.400
here as the terminus moves
from right to left.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.500
So be very careful about your
terminology on this.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.133
Here's a terminal moraine
left behind by that.

00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:23.267
There's an esker, that I'll
define in just a moment, and

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:29.500
there are some drumlins that I
will define in just a moment.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.400
An esker is a river flowing
underneath the ice, underneath

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.467
the ice sheet, that gets partly
filled up with debris.

00:38:41.467 --> 00:38:44.867
And then when the ice sheet
melts, you're left with this

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:49.633
little pile of debris
where the river was.

00:38:49.633 --> 00:38:53.400
So the river, instead of being
a depression in this case as

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.733
we're used to seeing, because
there was a river up inside a

00:38:56.733 --> 00:39:02.167
glacier, actually leaves an
elevated tongue marking where

00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:05.100
that river was.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:11.233
Here's a nice example of one
up in Manitoba of an esker.

00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:14.933
So an ice sheet covered this,
there was a river underneath

00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:20.267
the ice, and the debris that
collected in that sub-ice

00:39:20.267 --> 00:39:24.167
river, then when the ice
melted away left

00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:25.433
you with that esker.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.500
Glacial striations, you can see
them here in New England,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:40.900
scrapes on bedrock indicating
that a glacier has slid over

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.100
that particular part of rock.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.000
Usually underneath the ice
there are chunks of rock

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.800
embedded in the ice.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.667
And so you're scraping these
embedded chunks over the

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:54.767
bedrock, leaving a
scraping mark.

00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:58.200
You can tell what direction
the glacier was moving.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:03.633
Well it's hard to distinguish
that from that, but at least

00:40:03.633 --> 00:40:05.800
you know it was either moving
in that direction or in that

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.267
direction from the direction of
those glacial striations.

00:40:12.167 --> 00:40:16.533
Sometimes they can be deeper
grooves, as you see in this

00:40:16.533 --> 00:40:18.133
piece of rock here.

00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:19.567
So that tells you that
a glacier has

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:24.167
scraped over this terrain.

00:40:24.167 --> 00:40:26.700
The glacial erratic
are easy to spot.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.000
A very large boulder sitting
on a bedrock that doesn't

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.867
match it in terms
of rock type.

00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:34.767
So it's foreign.

00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:36.000
It didn't come from here.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.400
It's been moved from
some other place.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.767
Now, if it was a small rock, you
could say well maybe water

00:40:42.767 --> 00:40:45.033
could have moved that.

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:47.033
But if it gets to be this size
there's nothing there for

00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:50.433
scale, but that's two or three
meters in height water could

00:40:50.433 --> 00:40:52.833
not have moved that
large rock.

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:55.700
So that had to be a glacier
that moved it.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:01.167
The word erratic means it's a
large boulder in a place that

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:04.933
has different rock type than
the boulder itself.

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:07.100
So it didn't come from there,
it was carried in

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.567
by somewhere else.

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:10.900
Sometimes you can trace these
back and find out

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.500
where they came from.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.000
That will give you a direction
of ice motion.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.300
Here's another in Denali
National Park and in Calgary,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.867
examples of glacial erratics.

00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:27.100
You can spot these pretty
easily up in Canada.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:34.633
A drumlin is a hill that has
been shaped by a glacier

00:41:34.633 --> 00:41:35.900
sliding over it.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:43.300
It's got usually a steep end,
and a less steep end,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.233
indicating the ice flow,
in this case, goes

00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.900
from left to right.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.100
So it scrapes off material here,
and then deposits it on

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.800
this long tail back here.

00:41:56.767 --> 00:42:01.167
Here's a drumlin seen
from the air.

00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:03.067
So the glacier was flowing
from left to

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:04.300
right in this case.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.333
Here's a bunch of them, I guess
the farmers had planted

00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:16.433
fields in the flat terrain, but
they've left forests on

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:17.700
some of these drumlins.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.867
And then here's a field of
drumlins up in Canada seen

00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:26.567
from a satellite.

00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:29.700
And it's pretty easy to guess
which way the ice flow was.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.333
It was from upper left to lower
right forming all of

00:42:33.333 --> 00:42:34.600
those drumlins.

00:42:38.667 --> 00:42:44.100
So that's a little bit of what
you can look for as you drive

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.733
around to convince yourselves
that there was big ice on the

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:50.600
landscape not too long ago.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.367
And this is what
it looked like.

00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:54.067
So I want to spend a few slides
just describing what

00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:57.733
the Earth was like during this
Last Glacial Maximum.

00:42:57.733 --> 00:43:02.833
Roughly 20,000 to 14,000
years before present.

00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:06.067
In addition to Greenland and
Antarctica, there was this

00:43:06.067 --> 00:43:08.467
giant Laurentide ice sheet.

00:43:08.467 --> 00:43:10.033
An ice sheet on the West
Coast called the

00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:11.600
Cordilleran ice sheet.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.700
But look, Alaska was, at least
Northern Alaska was

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.100
still free of ice.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.300
That's a bit of a surprise.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.933
However, there are also large
ice sheets in Scandinavia and

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.833
Northern Russia as well.

00:43:27.367 --> 00:43:32.067
When you look at the drumlins
and the glacial striations,

00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:36.867
and the glacial erratics for the
Laurentide ice sheet, you

00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:40.500
can work out a sense of motion,
how the ice was

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.533
moving, and this is what
you come up with.

00:43:43.533 --> 00:43:46.967
The little arrows indicate what
local evidence tells us

00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:50.200
about the direction of motion
of the ice sheet.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.833
Down in our part of the
country, it was

00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:55.033
from north to south.

00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:59.467
But up in Northern Canada
actually, south to north.

00:43:59.467 --> 00:44:03.867
So it seemed like there's a dome
of ice here with a center

00:44:03.867 --> 00:44:07.633
somewhere around here, and the
ice is then spreading out

00:44:07.633 --> 00:44:10.100
gravitationally away
from that center.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.933
That's the view or that's the
vision you get when you see a

00:44:13.933 --> 00:44:15.167
map like this.

00:44:15.167 --> 00:44:18.867
Gravity is doing the spreading,
and the high point

00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:21.733
must have been somewhere in
the middle here with ice

00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:25.133
moving out in the different
directions.

00:44:25.133 --> 00:44:27.967
One of the reasons they put
a different name on the

00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:31.300
Cordilleran ice sheet is because
you see some eastern

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.033
movement here, which conflicts
with what the Laurentide ice

00:44:34.033 --> 00:44:35.433
sheet movement has been.

00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:39.100
So there must have been a seam
here along the Rockies where

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.500
those two ice sheets were
kind of butting up

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.767
against each other.

00:44:46.167 --> 00:44:48.233
Questions on that?

00:44:48.233 --> 00:44:50.633
That's the Laurentide
ice sheet.

00:44:50.633 --> 00:44:54.433
Now, down here in New England,
we've got this remarkable

00:44:54.433 --> 00:45:00.133
feature called Long Island to
look at, as well as a Martha's

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:02.467
Vineyard and Nantucket.

00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:07.100
When the ice sheet came down
here, it moved offshore and

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.167
spent a long enough period
of time to build

00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:11.233
up a terminal moraine.

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:13.700
Then retreated slightly
and built up

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:14.667
another terminal moraine.

00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:19.800
So there are two terminal
moraines that now make up Long

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.967
Island, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket, as

00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:27.300
well as Cape Cod.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.333
Those are both--all those
features are basically

00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:33.367
terminal moraines left over from
the Last Glacial Maximum.

00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:37.567
So over New Haven here, we
probably still had several

00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:43.233
hundred meters of ice sliding
southwards, but then it

00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:48.300
tapered off, and the terminus
was roughly here, for a long

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.067
enough period of time to have
built up two substantial

00:45:52.067 --> 00:45:55.933
terminal moraines at
those locations.

00:45:55.933 --> 00:45:59.233
So we've got evidence right
outside our front door that

00:45:59.233 --> 00:46:02.267
this ice sheet was overhead
not that many years ago.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.267
Questions on that?

00:46:11.767 --> 00:46:16.167
Well now, we need to get a
little more quantitative about

00:46:16.167 --> 00:46:18.800
climate change.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.900
I won't be able to finish this,
but let me say a few

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.600
words about it and then we'll
cut until Wednesday.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.633
But we have to get
more quantitative

00:46:25.633 --> 00:46:26.300
about climate change.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.733
We have to have records that
we can go back uniformly in

00:46:30.733 --> 00:46:33.167
time to see how things are
changing quantitatively.

00:46:35.833 --> 00:46:38.767
One of the best ways to do
this is by looking at the

00:46:38.767 --> 00:46:42.567
stable isotopes of water.

00:46:42.567 --> 00:46:46.233
And I wanted to remind you about
what I mean by isotopes

00:46:46.233 --> 00:46:48.900
and how we're going to use
them climatologically.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:54.000
You remember that an isotope
of a chemical element is

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.367
defined as an analog to that
element that has an extra

00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:08.033
neutron or more in the nucleus
to give it an added mass, but

00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:12.567
without any change in its
electrical charge.

00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:22.267
So for example, hydrogen is
normally one proton with

00:47:22.267 --> 00:47:26.000
electrons going around it.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.767
The most common isotope of
hydrogen is called deuterium.

00:47:30.767 --> 00:47:35.067
It has a proton and a neutron
in its nucleus, so it's got

00:47:35.067 --> 00:47:38.300
double the mass, but
the same charge.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.933
The same charge means
it behaves

00:47:39.933 --> 00:47:43.833
chemically like its parent.

00:47:43.833 --> 00:47:46.100
But that extra mass makes
it behave a little bit

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.167
differently when it comes
to changing phase.

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:56.167
With oxygen, the dominant, let's
say the parent isotope

00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:58.867
of oxygen has a mass of 16.

00:47:58.867 --> 00:48:03.533
Eight protons, eight neutrons
in the nucleus.

00:48:03.533 --> 00:48:06.867
However, it's still oxygen
if I add two more

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:10.100
neutrons to the nucleus.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.500
Now it becomes oxygen 18.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.200
These are the particular
isotopes I'm going to be

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.700
talking about next time with
respect to using--

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.700
looking for clues for climate
change, particularly deuterium

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.500
versus hydrogen, and oxygen
18 versus oxygen 16.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.767
So I can make up new water
vapor molecules now.

00:48:31.767 --> 00:48:35.800
If I make water from a
normal--two normal hydrogens

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.700
and a normal oxygen, it's going
to have a mass of 18 16

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.800
plus 1 plus 1, that's 18.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.867
If I replace one of the
hydrogens with deuterium,

00:48:45.867 --> 00:48:49.200
that's going to give water
with a mass of 19.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.533
If instead, I keep the two
hydrogens as hydrogen, but

00:48:52.533 --> 00:49:01.500
replace the oxygen 16 with
oxygen 18, I get a mass of 20.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.200
Turns out that these heavier
isotopes of water have a

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.933
slightly lower vapor pressure.

00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:12.100
This means they evaporate
more slowly and they

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.367
condense more readily.

00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:20.700
And this is what gives
them--what provides to us

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.167
information about how the
hydrological cycle was working

00:49:24.167 --> 00:49:29.000
in the past by looking at the
ratio of these two isotopes.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.833
I'm out of time today, but
before Wednesday if you could

00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:35.400
spend a few minutes reviewing
your high school and college

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.800
chemistry about the nature of
these isotopes, that'll put

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.233
you in a good position
to understand

00:49:40.233 --> 00:49:41.467
the lecture on Wednesday.

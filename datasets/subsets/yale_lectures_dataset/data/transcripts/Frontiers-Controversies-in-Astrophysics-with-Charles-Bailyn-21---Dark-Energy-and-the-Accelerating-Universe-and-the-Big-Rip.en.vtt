00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.262
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Welcome to prefrosh

00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:01.751
[newly admitted students
visiting during Yale's "Bulldog

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:03.499
Days" program].
I'm talking about black holes

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.042
at 8 o'clock this evening.
Come listen to that,

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.991
too, and in the meantime,
we'll talk about the future of

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:12.420
the Universe.
Okay.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.190
Logistical questions?
Anything?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.500
All right.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.280
Where were we?
We were here.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.327
This is the data that
demonstrate that the Universe is

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:33.452
filled with dark energy,
a kind of anti-gravity that is

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:37.568
pushing the Universe apart.
And what this is--this is the

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:40.825
same data on both of these
plots, just plotted slightly

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:42.738
differently.
On the top plot,

00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:46.393
what they've done is they've
plotted the apparent magnitude

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:49.230
of these supernovae versus their
redshift.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.652
And so, apparent
magnitude--because the absolute

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:56.400
magnitude is always the same.
These are standard candles.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.060
So, from the apparent
magnitude, you can figure out

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.829
what the distance modulus is.
That gives you a measure of the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.541
distance.
So, this is just distance

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.027
versus velocity.
Now, we've plotted distance

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:08.060
versus velocity of bunch of
times.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.811
That's the Hubble Diagram.
Most of the times we've plotted

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:12.909
it, it's come out on a straight
line.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.400
Do you understand why this plot
isn't on a straight line?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.992
The top one,
I'm talking about,

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:21.930
now--why those lines are
curved?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.319
What's the y-axis?
The y-axis is--yes?

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.189
Student: It's
logarithmic.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.120
Professor Charles
Bailyn: It's logarithmic.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.209
Thank you very much.
Yes, it's magnitude.

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.569
Magnitudes are upside down and
logarithmic, right?

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.580
That's why faint stars have
high numbers up at the top.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.996
And because one axis is
logarithmic and the other axis

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:42.930
isn't, of course,
it curves.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.086
You could--the way--if you want
a nice straight line,

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:48.940
you just make this axis
logarithmic, as well.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.207
What we've done down on the
bottom is just subtracted off

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:57.855
the empty Universe--a Universe
with no matter and no energy in

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:02.046
it--so that you can see more
clearly the way these three

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:06.016
lines diverge.
And these three lines are three

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.699
different models of the
Universe.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.439
And they're denoted by these Ω
factors.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.860
Ω _matter,
that's the density of matter

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.845
divided by the critical density.
Ω_λ,

00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:22.659
that's the energy density of
the dark energy divided by that

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.675
same critical density.
And down here is an Ω

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:30.105
_matter of 1.
That's the dividing line

00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:33.029
between a Universe that
re-collapses and a Universe that

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.507
expands forever.
So, if the Universe were--if

00:02:35.507 --> 00:02:38.653
the points that we studied were
down here, the Universe would

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:41.129
re-collapse.
If they're up here, it wouldn't.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.500
This dotted line here is 1/4
and 0.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.662
1/4 in Ω_matter is
the amount of matter that we

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:54.919
actually observe in dark matter
and galaxies.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.699
If you go out and count up all
the dark matter in the galaxies,

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.538
add it all up,
you get to about 1/4 of the

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:02.624
critical density.
So, what people were kind of

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:06.759
expecting to see was something
between here and here.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.685
And, of course,
that wasn't what happened,

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:11.994
as we discussed last time.
Turns out, all the points are

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:15.501
too high, and therefore,
you end with a current best

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:19.628
fit--the best guess for the way
of the Universe is this solid

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:22.826
line here.
This is called the standard

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:27.722
model or the concordance model,
where you've got a 1/4 of--the

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:31.728
Ω_matter is 1/4,
but there's a whole bunch of

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:34.040
dark energy.
3/4 of the Universe is in this

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.025
mysterious form of dark energy,
which tends to push things

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:39.120
apart rather than pull them
together.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.726
That's why these points are
above the 0 line,

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:45.092
instead of below it.
And that's the current best

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:49.791
idea for what the Universe is.
So, by virtue of the fact that

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:54.298
these points lie on the solid
line rather than on somewhere

00:03:54.298 --> 00:03:58.261
between these two dotted lines,
or perhaps even below,

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.565
we make this remarkable
conclusion: that the Universe is

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.930
3/4 full of something we
absolutely don't understand,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.967
called dark energy,
which has the effect of an

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.705
anti-gravity.
And then, it turns out that

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.710
Einstein's biggest mistake is
right after all.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.789
Pretty hefty conclusion to lay
on the basis of two dozen points

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.886
with, let it be said,
pretty sizeable error bars on

00:04:22.886 --> 00:04:26.364
any one of those points.
And so, I thought,

00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:29.719
at the start of today,
I would talk about what these

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.831
points are,
how they are measured,

00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:34.810
and what could go wrong with
this kind of measurement.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.237
Because, you know,
we've transformed what we think

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.399
about the Universe based on
this.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:47.774
And so, it behooves one to
actually try and understand

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:51.497
what's going on.
I'll come back to that in a

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:53.980
minute.
So, what are these points?

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.073
What are we measuring?
And why do we think it might

00:04:59.073 --> 00:05:02.457
even work?
What we are measuring is Type

00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:03.980
Ia Supernovae.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.273
So, this is typically
astronomical nomenclature,

00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:12.870
right?
We go out.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.750
We find a bunch of things.
We divide them into categories.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.298
We call them Type I, Type 2.
It then turns out that each of

00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:22.723
those categories has
sub-categories,

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:26.645
Type Ia.
The joke is when astronomers

00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:31.137
find three objects,
that's two categories and an

00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:34.004
exception.
Type Ia Supernovae,

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:37.067
though, are by now a fairly
well-defined category,

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.379
and here's what we think they
are.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.687
Think back to the middle part
of the class--to the black hole

00:05:42.687 --> 00:05:45.332
section of the class,
where we were talking about

00:05:45.332 --> 00:05:47.187
x-ray binaries.
X-ray binary,

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:49.980
you'll recall,
is a black hole in orbit around

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.339
something--some other kind of
star,

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.050
and it pulls material from that
other star onto itself.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.504
So, Type I Supernovae come from
a very similar category of

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:01.465
objects.
Here's a normal star,

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:04.306
except it's pulled out of shape
a little bit,

00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:06.630
and it's in a double star
system.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.649
Here's something else.
This is a white dwarf.

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:13.383
In this case,
you will remember,

00:06:13.383 --> 00:06:16.348
white dwarfs are these very
compact stars--not compact

00:06:16.348 --> 00:06:19.926
enough to be black holes,
but fairly compact--that are

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:23.980
created at the end of the
lifetime of stars like the Sun.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.876
So, a fairly dense object.
And just as in the x-ray

00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:31.026
binaries, stuff is being pulled
off of the normal star onto the

00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:33.765
white dwarf.
So, then, what happens to this

00:06:33.765 --> 00:06:35.043
stuff?
First of all,

00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:38.804
the white dwarf has had all its
hydrogen and helium fused

00:06:38.804 --> 00:06:42.230
together, so there's no hydrogen
or helium left.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.413
So, this white dwarf is
composed of elements like carbon

00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:49.683
and oxygen and nitrogen and
neon, and so on,

00:06:49.683 --> 00:06:53.029
up the line,
but no hydrogen and helium.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.350
So, the material that comes
from the normal stars,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.623
full of hydrogen and
helium--it's pretty much all

00:06:57.623 --> 00:07:01.366
hydrogen and helium.
So, the accreted material,

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:10.360
what does it do?
Lands on the white dwarf.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.329
And as it lands, it heats up.
It falls down.

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:14.570
It heats up,
gets very hot,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.436
gets very dense.
And so, it undergoes nuclear

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:21.736
fusion, just like the material
in the middle of the Sun or in

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:24.818
the middle, presumably,
of this normal star,

00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:26.808
as well.
So, there's all this fusion

00:07:26.808 --> 00:07:29.349
going on.
One of the features of the way

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:33.504
this works on a white dwarf is
it is usually true that what

00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:37.157
happens is hydrogen and helium
piles up for a while,

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.879
and then, it has a big
explosion.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:42.649
It doesn't usually burn
steadily.

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:50.420
And so, what actually happens
is, you have occasional

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:58.190
thermonuclear explosions of the
accreted material.

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:06.000
And so, you pile up all this
hydrogen and you wait some

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.545
amount of time,
somewhere between 10 days and

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:12.930
10^(5) years,
depending on the object.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.931
You pile up all this hydrogen
and helium and finally it gets

00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:18.932
dense and hot enough to explode,
and then it explodes all at

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.727
once.
Huge hydrogen bomb on the

00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:24.111
surface of this white dwarf.
And that makes the system much,

00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.711
much brighter,
because there's all this stuff

00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:29.841
exploding.
This is the phenomenon we call

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.644
a nova, because it looked to the
ancients as if a new star had

00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:39.290
appeared, because the thing had
gotten so much brighter.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.380
Okay.
So, stuff piles up.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.590
Novae occur.
More stuff piles up.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.136
More novae occur.
And one of the things that's

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:51.921
happening while this is going on
is that the white dwarf is

00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.672
gradually getting more massive,
because it's piling up all this

00:08:56.672 --> 00:08:59.986
extra material.
Oh, the consequence of the nova

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:03.740
is that all the hydrogen and
helium gets fused into carbon,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.330
oxygen, nitrogen,
neon, and so forth.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.431
So then, it looks just like the
rest of the white dwarf,

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:12.984
gets assimilated into the white
dwarf, except the white dwarf is

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:16.607
bigger now.
So, the white dwarf gets more

00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:21.970
massive and gradually more,
and more, and more massive.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.533
But, you may recall,
there's a limit to how this

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:27.931
long could go on.
The reason there's a limit to

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:32.491
how long this can go on is
because of something we talked

00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:35.830
about before that Chandrasekhar
Limit,

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:41.689
which says that white dwarfs
cannot be more massive than 1.4

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:46.323
times the mass of the Sun.
So, what happens when this

00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:50.884
white dwarf, which starts out at
some perfectly respectable mass,

00:09:50.884 --> 00:09:51.953
0.
6 of the Sun,

00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:55.246
or 1 solar mass.
And it's piling up all this

00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:58.905
material from its friend,
and gradually getting more and

00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:01.211
more massive,
and then, it reaches this

00:10:01.211 --> 00:10:03.799
limit, this Chandrasekhar limit.
So then, what happens?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.509
What happens--remember what the
Chandrasekhar limit is.

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.820
If you've got a white dwarf
that's bigger than the

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.995
Chandrasekhar limit,
then the white dwarf cannot

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:17.049
hold itself up against gravity,
and so, the whole thing

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.740
collapses all at once.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.593
And, as is generally the case,
when it collapses,

00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:27.679
it gets hot.
It gets dense.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:30.960
That's what generally happens
in a collapse.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.207
And so, the carbon,
in particular,

00:10:35.207 --> 00:10:42.287
but all the other elements as
well--so, carbon and other

00:10:42.287 --> 00:10:47.050
elements in the white dwarf
fuse,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:53.286
and that generates energy.
And they fuse together to form

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:58.696
heavy elements such as iron,
and heavier than that,

00:10:58.696 --> 00:11:00.320
all at once.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:07.214
So what happens is,
every time this occurs,

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:10.299
you have exactly the same
amount of stuff.

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:13.769
This always happens when you
have 1.4 solar mass white

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:16.059
dwarfs, because that's the
limit.

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:18.529
You've gradually built up to
that limit.

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:23.350
And so, you have what you might
refer to as a standard bomb.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.500
We've talked about standard
candles.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:35.970
This is a standard bomb.
You always have the same amount

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:43.550
of material and it all explodes
at once.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.908
Well, actually,
it takes about,

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.809
what?
A hundred milliseconds,

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.877
something like that,
but basically,

00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:55.280
all at once.
So, you blow up 1.4 solar

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.383
masses of carbon all at once.
Now, the advantage of standard

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:00.791
things is that if you have a
standard bomb with the same

00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.120
amount of fuel,
every one of them should be

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.715
exactly as bright as every other
one, and that's what we need to

00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:08.770
make these distance
measurements.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.187
Remember?
So, if you look at these

00:12:12.187 --> 00:12:18.118
things, you see that they're
always the same brightness,

00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:22.539
so, they're terrific standard
candles.

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:26.087
And so, one of the things that
happens is that you look at

00:12:26.087 --> 00:12:29.573
these things and you can tell,
from how bright they look,

00:12:29.573 --> 00:12:34.736
exactly how far away they are.
You also measure their redshift

00:12:34.736 --> 00:12:40.535
when they blow up in this way,
and you get to put a point on

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:44.270
that redshift versus distance
plot.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.220
And they're stupendously bright.
These things have an absolute

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.869
magnitude of -19.5.
They outshine whole galaxies,

00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:55.940
for about a week or two,
until they go away.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.940
And so, you can see them at
enormous distances.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.285
So, they're just about the
perfect thing for exploring

00:13:02.285 --> 00:13:05.235
cosmology.
But we were only really able to

00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:09.166
do this in the--starting in the
early 1990s, because there were

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:12.210
two key advances that were made
at that time.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:18.904
One is that the Hubble Space
Telescope measured things like

00:13:18.904 --> 00:13:23.059
Cepheids and other kinds of
stars,

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:27.512
other kinds of distance
measurements,

00:13:27.512 --> 00:13:35.179
in galaxies that historically
had Type Ia Supernovae.

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:39.197
These things don't occur very
often, once every couple of 100

00:13:39.197 --> 00:13:42.094
years per galaxy.
There hasn't been one in our

00:13:42.094 --> 00:13:45.170
own galaxy since before they
invented the telescope.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.747
We're kind of overdue, actually.
One of the worrying things–

00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:51.685
You know, it would be great to
have one of these supernovae in

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:53.716
our galaxy.
We could study it enormously

00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:55.143
carefully.
The problem is,

00:13:55.143 --> 00:13:58.719
all the telescopes are too big
and--because it would burn out

00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:01.094
all the instruments.
You put one of these big

00:14:01.094 --> 00:14:02.600
research telescopes pointing to
it.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.439
So, one of the things that we
have, just in case,

00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:09.048
sort of, for emergencies in the
telescopes I've worked with in

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.139
Chile,
is we have a big thing you can

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:13.840
put over the front of the
telescope and stop it down to

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.071
about a couple of inches across,
just in case there's a Type

00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:20.309
Ia super--any kind of
supernovae in our own galaxy.

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:23.532
But when these--we do have
supernovae in the historical

00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:26.559
record.
Kepler and Tycho saw one.

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:30.039
And then, back in the eleventh
century, there was a famous one

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.720
observed by the Chinese and Arab
astronomers.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.994
The Europeans were,
of course, in barbarity at the

00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:39.073
time and didn't even notice.
And--which, now,

00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:42.497
we see the Crab Nebula,
which is a big outward-going

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:44.648
explosion.
And these things become the

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:47.129
brightest objects in the sky.
You can see them in the daytime.

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:49.950
Pretty amazing,
but it hasn't happened for 400

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.269
years, at least,
in our own galaxy.

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:53.820
Student: How long did
you say they lasted?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.713
Professor Charles
Bailyn: They last--well,

00:14:55.713 --> 00:14:58.080
I'll show you in a minute what
the light curve looks like.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.652
They take a couple weeks to
rise to their maximum

00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:03.440
brightness, and then they decay
over a few months.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.360
So, you can see them for a
little while.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.625
So, it just--measured Cepheids.
This meant that we could

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.120
calibrate them.
Remember the distance ladder?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.220
So, you could calibrate these
things – calibration.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.596
And this, in particular,
meant that we know the absolute

00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:29.529
magnitude, which is crucial for
determining these distances.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:33.020
What, then, came out of that
and other things,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.046
mostly, actually,
done with ground-based

00:15:36.046 --> 00:15:41.232
telescopes--so,
ground-based telescopes

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:48.333
discovered and compared many of
these things,

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:54.768
many of these Type Ias,
and discovered that,

00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:58.038
you know, it isn't actually
quite true that they all look to

00:15:58.038 --> 00:16:01.378
be the same brightness.
Because, it would be true,

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:05.759
if you could measure all of the
energy that came out of these

00:16:05.759 --> 00:16:08.033
things.
But that isn't actually what

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.965
you measure.
What you measure is all of the

00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:14.215
photons in a certain
range--depending on your

00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:18.721
detector and how you set your
telescope up--all photons within

00:16:18.721 --> 00:16:22.710
a certain range of wavelengths
at a certain time.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.518
And that is not the same thing
as measuring all the energy that

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:32.518
the thing gives out.
And so, it turns out that if

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:42.812
you measure all photons in some
wavelength region at some time,

00:16:42.812 --> 00:16:51.279
that actually varies from one
object to another.

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:54.005
This can vary by,
oh, I don't know,

00:16:54.005 --> 00:16:58.815
15 - 20%, but that's enough to
cause you some real trouble in

00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:02.577
making these measurements.
But what they discovered was

00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:04.080
that you can correct for this.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:14.837
If you measure the color and
the decay rate--that is to say,

00:17:14.837 --> 00:17:19.038
how fast it gets fainter.
So, your question turns out to

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.479
be very important.
These things behave differently

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:25.579
depending on how fast they go
away.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:30.085
If you measure the color and
the decay rate,

00:17:30.085 --> 00:17:35.848
you can correct for some of
these deviations and turn it

00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:40.039
back it into a good standard
candle.

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:44.788
And I'll show you how this is
done in just a second,

00:17:44.788 --> 00:17:49.640
okay?
How we doing?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:57.320
Okay, let me turn this off for
a second and go back to here.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.285
All right.
This is the key thing that was

00:18:01.285 --> 00:18:05.198
found out in the early 1990s.
Up on the top,

00:18:05.198 --> 00:18:10.150
you have observations from a
whole bunch of supernovae.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.204
This is time.
So, this is 0,20 days,

00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:15.668
40 days, 60 days.
So, this is time,

00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:17.599
counting from the peak
brightness.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.950
And most of the time you can
observe these things before they

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.237
get to peak brightness.
You watch them get brighter and

00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:25.142
then you watch them get fainter.
In the top plot there,

00:18:25.142 --> 00:18:27.067
we're plotting,
more or less,

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:29.940
absolute magnitude.
Think of it--it's a complicated

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.960
thing, but think of it as
absolute magnitude.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.625
So -19.5, as I said,
is a typical

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:39.182
magnitude--absolute magnitude.
And each color is a different

00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:41.259
supernova.
So, they've made repeated

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:43.759
observations of a large number
of supernovae.

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:46.622
And then, the line is just
connecting the dots,

00:18:46.622 --> 00:18:50.396
connecting the observations.
And you can see from that top

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:53.879
plot that it is not true,
that every supernova has the

00:18:53.879 --> 00:18:57.099
same brightness,
at peak or at any other time.

00:18:57.099 --> 00:19:01.637
And so, the green supernova on
the bottom there gets up to

00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:05.697
about -18.8, whereas,
the orange one on the top gets

00:19:05.697 --> 00:19:09.390
up to about -20.
That's almost a factor of 3 in

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.660
difference of peak brightness.
But then you can make this

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.859
correction.
They measure the color of the

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:18.150
thing, which is not apparent on
this particular plot.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.019
They measure the rate of decay,
and that is apparent.

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:23.630
You can tell the green ones,
the ones at the bottom,

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.240
tend to fall off faster than
the ones at the top.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.927
And they came up with a
correction formula that allows

00:19:29.927 --> 00:19:33.754
the absolute magnitudes of these
things to be corrected,

00:19:33.754 --> 00:19:38.556
and that's what they plot here.
These are these same exact data

00:19:38.556 --> 00:19:43.137
points as they have on the top
line, except corrected for the

00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:47.490
differences in observed color
and observed decay rate.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.920
And you can see,
now, you've got a very

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.693
beautiful combined light curve
where everything does exactly

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.059
the same thing as all the
others.

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:59.469
And, in particular,
the maximum brightness of these

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:02.470
things is always the same at
around -19.5.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.960
So, you have to make this
correction in order to be able

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.369
to use these things effectively
as standard candles.

00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:14.411
And so, when that was done,
and we had calibrated this,

00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:15.819
and they thought,
well,

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.478
now we know,
every time we see one of these

00:20:18.478 --> 00:20:21.817
things, we'll just follow it up,
follow it down,

00:20:21.817 --> 00:20:25.854
make this correction,
and then we have--we know what

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:29.239
the absolute magnitude is.
We measure the apparent

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:30.950
magnitude.
We determine the distance.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.539
We get a spectrum along the way
so that we can get a redshift.

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:38.509
And then, we can make these
plots for distant objects.

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:41.461
These guys aren't particularly
distant, because you want to be

00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:43.930
able to get really accurate
measurements of them.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.778
And so, if this set were the
ones that were observed so close

00:20:47.778 --> 00:20:51.625
to us at such low redshifts that
you can't tell the different

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:56.002
cosmological models apart.
So then, people got very fired

00:20:56.002 --> 00:20:56.910
up.
They said, aha,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.079
we're going to figure out
everything that is happening in

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.900
the Universe by looking at these
supernovae.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.713
And they started up big
observational projects to find

00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:10.411
many high redshift supernovae.
So, these things are going to

00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:13.942
be quite faint.
They're going to be--they have

00:21:13.942 --> 00:21:18.773
distance moduluses of close to
45, and so, they'll have an

00:21:18.773 --> 00:21:23.623
apparent magnitude as low as 25,
which is really very hard to

00:21:23.623 --> 00:21:26.019
see.
So here's what they do.

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:28.600
First of all,
let me just show you this

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.070
picture.
This is just fun.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.591
Let's see, here.
If I do this,

00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:40.910
that will be good,
except I think I want this.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.471
There we go--all right.
This is a photograph from the

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.579
Hubble Space Telescope of empty
space.

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:52.710
They picked a part of the sky
in which there was nothing.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.862
Actually, that's not true.
There was one star,

00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:59.460
one faint star that they knew
about, and nothing else.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.079
And they took the space
telescope and they looked at it

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:06.242
for about three weeks in a row.
And this is the picture they

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.946
got.
You can see two or three stars

00:22:08.946 --> 00:22:10.947
in this picture.
This is one,

00:22:10.947 --> 00:22:14.039
and there are a couple of
others scattered around.

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:16.352
You can tell they're stars
because they have this,

00:22:16.352 --> 00:22:19.089
sort of, spike pattern from the
optics of the telescope.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:23.789
Everything else that you see in
this picture is a galaxy.

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:27.317
There's a whole galaxy,
each one of them with billions

00:22:27.317 --> 00:22:29.390
of stars.
There are, I think,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.289
13,000 of them?
8,000?

00:22:31.289 --> 00:22:32.610
How many in the ultra deep
field?

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.349
I don't remember.
Huh?

00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:37.329
Student: Are any of them
lensed?

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:38.902
Professor Charles
Bailyn: A couple of them are

00:22:38.902 --> 00:22:39.869
lensed, but most of them,
not.

00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.950
So, most of them are just
straight-up images of galaxies.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.249
You could see,
in the bigger ones,

00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:50.500
some nice spirals and all the
usual kinds of galaxy shapes.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.240
This is a really small piece of
the sky.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.281
This is a piece of the sky
about 1% of the area of the full

00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:00.644
Moon.
So, if you looked at the whole

00:23:00.644 --> 00:23:03.802
area covered by the full
Moon--picture the full Moon up

00:23:03.802 --> 00:23:06.609
in the sky--and you did this
kind of picture,

00:23:06.609 --> 00:23:09.960
you would discover literally
millions of different galaxies.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.333
So, this means that you can
discover supernovae in the--so,

00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:17.349
there are thousands of
galaxies, here.

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:21.730
And if supernovae occur once
per every 100 years per galaxy,

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.184
there ought to be about ten or
twenty supernovae going off in

00:23:26.184 --> 00:23:29.079
this tiny piece of space right
now.

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:32.339
Or any other such tiny piece of
space.

00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:35.654
And so, if you're looking for
high redshift supernovae,

00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:38.990
you don't care where you point.
They're everywhere.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.330
And so, you just pick out some
nice blank piece of space,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.312
take really deep pictures of
them, and wait for the

00:23:45.312 --> 00:23:51.262
supernovae to start showing up.
And this is what people have

00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:54.541
done.
So, here's a little bit of data

00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:58.969
from the Supernova Cosmology
Project, which is one of the

00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:03.240
groups that was attempting to do
this in the 1990s.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.235
So, in the background,
here, is just a huge field of

00:24:06.235 --> 00:24:08.819
stars that they happened to be
looking at.

00:24:08.819 --> 00:24:14.840
Then, they've taken this tiny
piece of the sky and blown it

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.971
up.
So, here's their first image of

00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:17.991
it.
By the way, this,

00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:20.903
and this, and this--these are
galaxies, but they're taken from

00:24:20.903 --> 00:24:23.289
the ground instead of with the
space telescope.

00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:24.950
And so, they look like blobby
things.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.599
You can't see any of the
structure.

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:30.015
And then, three weeks later
they take another picture,

00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:33.109
and it turns out,
there's a little extra light on

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:37.537
the side of one of the galaxies.
Now, imagine taking something

00:24:37.537 --> 00:24:41.897
maybe 100 times bigger than this
whole background picture and

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:46.413
looking for that difference.
You would make your graduate

00:24:46.413 --> 00:24:49.890
students completely cross-eyed
doing this.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.480
And so, they do it digitally.
They do it differently.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.761
What you do is you take this
picture, each one of these

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:58.375
pixels, you know,
tells you exactly how many

00:24:58.375 --> 00:25:00.910
photons hit it.
So, it's all digitized.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.308
Each one of these is a number.
And you just take this number

00:25:04.308 --> 00:25:07.755
and subtract this number.
And you take the number from

00:25:07.755 --> 00:25:11.602
each pixel, subtract the number
that you got in the previous

00:25:11.602 --> 00:25:15.710
thing and get a subtracted image
of how much light there is,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.890
minus the light there was the
last time you looked at it.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.032
Here's the subtracted picture.
Now this, even a blind old

00:25:23.032 --> 00:25:27.164
professor can see,
has something interesting going

00:25:27.164 --> 00:25:29.386
on.
There's a new object that has

00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:32.880
appeared between the first
picture and the second picture.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.695
Now, up at the top,
in the upper right-hand corner

00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:39.028
there, that's a Hubble Space
Telescope picture taken of the

00:25:39.028 --> 00:25:41.601
same field,
while the supernova was in

00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:43.855
outburst.
And you can see,

00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:45.750
this galaxy,
here.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.599
That's the galaxy,
you know, below the arrow

00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:51.432
there.
And then, those two arrows are

00:25:51.432 --> 00:25:55.729
placed in exactly the same
relative position in these two

00:25:55.729 --> 00:25:58.314
pictures.
And so, in the Hubble Space

00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:01.334
Telescope picture,
you can see that the additional

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:04.910
light comes from a particular
point in the outskirts of the

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.161
galaxy.
But it wasn't discovered with

00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:10.078
the Hubble Space Telescope,
because the HST doesn't cover

00:26:10.078 --> 00:26:13.369
enough of the sky at once.
So, you try and discover these

00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:16.453
things from the ground,
because you can cover so much

00:26:16.453 --> 00:26:18.914
more of the sky.
And so, this is a discovery

00:26:18.914 --> 00:26:20.929
image.
And then, if you want more

00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:23.818
precise imaging,
then you have to tell Hubble,

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:26.579
or go and look at this
particular place.

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:29.010
Anyway, what they do is they
keep at it.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.236
They keep at it.
Every three days,

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:32.569
they make one of these
pictures.

00:26:32.569 --> 00:26:34.686
They make these difference
pictures, and they get these

00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:36.974
nice light curves.
And out of those light curves,

00:26:36.974 --> 00:26:38.980
they can then do the correction
factor.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.791
And then, once you've done
that--you also take a spectrum

00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:45.786
along the way for two purposes:
first of all,

00:26:45.786 --> 00:26:48.272
to get the redshift;
second of all,

00:26:48.272 --> 00:26:51.254
to make sure that it's a Type
Ia Supernova,

00:26:51.254 --> 00:26:54.480
rather than any of the other
five or six subtypes.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.252
And then, you put them on this
plot and you plot their apparent

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:04.442
magnitude, corrected by these
various factors,

00:27:04.442 --> 00:27:09.858
against the redshift.
And that's how you come up with

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:14.554
these kinds of data.
So, that's where this

00:27:14.554 --> 00:27:17.530
information comes from.

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:27.990
And there is,
as you see, a kind of

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.649
theoretical--both a theoretical
reason and an observational

00:27:32.649 --> 00:27:40.006
reason to trust these results.
So, there is a theoretical

00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:51.039
basis for thinking these things
are standard candles--namely,

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:53.684
that it's the same amount of
fuel each time one of these

00:27:53.684 --> 00:27:59.090
things goes off.
And there's also an empirical

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:08.328
basis, which is that after some
corrections, the nearby ones

00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:13.203
line up beautifully.
The nearby ones,

00:28:13.203 --> 00:28:17.900
for which you know the answer
in advance by other means--the

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.646
nearby ones line up well.
And where by "well",

00:28:21.646 --> 00:28:25.059
I mean less than 5% difference
between them.

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:30.700
And there still is about a few
percent difference.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.102
But if we observe enough of
them, we can average over that

00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:36.369
and we think we're going to be
okay.

00:28:36.369 --> 00:28:40.395
So, if you want to come up with
some kind of explanation for

00:28:40.395 --> 00:28:44.694
this that does not involve dark
energy, you've got to get around

00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:48.305
both of these points;
namely, the fact that we expect

00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:51.932
them to look like each other,
and the fact that they do look

00:28:51.932 --> 00:28:54.741
like each other.
Now, it's possible to do that

00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:56.949
and, in fact,
one of the problems on the

00:28:56.949 --> 00:28:59.269
problem set addresses just this
issue.

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:04.485
If you can invent some way that
all of the supernovae at a

00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:08.420
redshift of .8,
high redshifts like that,

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.177
are all systematically fainter
than otherwise identical-looking

00:29:13.177 --> 00:29:15.940
supernovae in the nearby
Universe,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.089
then you can get around this
problem.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.639
But they have to be
identical-looking in the sense

00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:22.929
that they have the same color
and decay rate,

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:26.392
but are fainter.
We don't see that in the local

00:29:26.392 --> 00:29:28.858
Universe.
We don't see a category of

00:29:28.858 --> 00:29:31.920
things, which have the same
color and decay rate,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.280
but one is fainter than the
other.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.469
But, who knows?
The Universe was,

00:29:37.469 --> 00:29:39.589
you know, half its size back
then.

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:40.759
All sorts of things were
different.

00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:44.015
Maybe there's some way that
supernovae then were

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:47.410
systematically different from
how they are now,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.250
except that they don't show it
in these particular ways.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.230
They only show it in the
overall brightness.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.800
That's tough.
That's tough, theoretically.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.526
It's tough empirically.
You know, you would expect that

00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:01.192
if that were true,
then there would be

00:30:01.192 --> 00:30:04.029
intermediate cases that we could
see, and we don't see them.

00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:06.580
But, you know,
shortly after this result was

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.140
announced, I used to--when I was
at conferences and stuff,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.469
I would try and take the
supernovae people off in a

00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.240
corner and give them beer and
stuff,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.858
until they would,
you know--and then,

00:30:15.858 --> 00:30:18.330
after you give them four beers,
you ask the question,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:22.512
what could be going wrong?
Do you really believe in dark

00:30:22.512 --> 00:30:25.057
energy?
And then, they start mumbling

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:28.585
stuff about all the different
weirdnesses that supernovae

00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:29.804
have.
And, of course,

00:30:29.804 --> 00:30:32.423
these are people who have
devoted their life to studying

00:30:32.423 --> 00:30:35.933
the weirdness of supernovae,
and so, they have many things

00:30:35.933 --> 00:30:39.369
that they will tell you under
cover of darkness.

00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:43.738
Which, of course,
then, everybody went out to try

00:30:43.738 --> 00:30:46.707
and check.
And none of these things have

00:30:46.707 --> 00:30:50.722
turned out to be able to provide
a satisfactory explanation for

00:30:50.722 --> 00:30:53.548
the data,
except the idea that there's

00:30:53.548 --> 00:30:56.621
something very significant,
cosmologically,

00:30:56.621 --> 00:31:00.921
going on.
Okay, so, from that point of

00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:06.663
view, it's kind of hard to avoid
believing this,

00:31:06.663 --> 00:31:10.940
which disturbed a lot of
people.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.104
And, in fact,
one of the reasons people

00:31:14.104 --> 00:31:19.100
believed this as quickly as they
did was that in the late--in

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.593
1998,
when this was first announced,

00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:24.907
it was not announced by one
group, it was announced by two

00:31:24.907 --> 00:31:29.778
different groups.
There were two groups trying to

00:31:29.778 --> 00:31:36.000
do the same thing--doing the
same thing and theyso,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.109
they were sort of spying on
each other, because this was an

00:31:38.109 --> 00:31:40.235
important result.
And they both found out,

00:31:40.235 --> 00:31:43.046
at a certain point,
that the other guys had been

00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:46.156
spending a year driving
themselves crazy because they

00:31:46.156 --> 00:31:48.800
didn't believe their results.
They were saying,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.379
look at this,
these things are getting--these

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:52.210
things are going totally in the
wrong direction.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.079
We must be wrong somehow.
And it turned out that both of

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:58.039
these groups had been spending
the past year trying to figure

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:00.210
out why their results were so
screwed up.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.547
But then, they spied on each
other and they found out that

00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:04.680
the other guys were having the
exact same problem,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.808
having taken their data and
dealt with it in quite a

00:32:07.808 --> 00:32:09.695
different way.
And so, then,

00:32:09.695 --> 00:32:13.037
miraculously enough,
they kind of submitted their

00:32:13.037 --> 00:32:16.170
papers within twenty-four hours
of each other,

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:20.863
so they both got credit.
And so, the two groups doing

00:32:20.863 --> 00:32:25.160
the same things,
but doing them differently.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.537
Different approaches,
in some ways,

00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:33.310
got the same result.
And in particular,

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.238
one group were a bunch of
particle physicists led by Saul

00:32:36.238 --> 00:32:38.622
Perlmutter,
who had gotten depressed by the

00:32:38.622 --> 00:32:41.980
fact that the Super Collider was
cancelled in the early 1990s,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.680
and had decided--somebody
described this as "adult onset

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.119
cosmology," where you used to be
interested in particle physics,

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:52.071
but then, they didn't build
your machine,

00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:54.170
so now you're interested in
astrophysics.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:33:00.420
And those guys took a very
particle physics approach to it.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.065
They had a big team,
with a team leader and a whole

00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:06.826
hierarchy.
The other guys were a bunch of

00:33:06.826 --> 00:33:10.601
supernova--and they were very
expert in the cosmology side of

00:33:10.601 --> 00:33:12.445
things,
and in the dark energy

00:33:12.445 --> 00:33:14.380
explanations,
and stuff like that.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.950
The supernova experts,
the sort of guys who knew all

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.319
the weirdnesses about
supernovae, formed another

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:21.940
group, but it was totally
differently organized.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.892
It was kind of a loose
confederation of small research

00:33:24.892 --> 00:33:28.451
groups here and there.
They had done this interesting

00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:33.339
work with the correction factors
on supernovae some years before,

00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:37.329
and they approached it as,
you know, my group will do this

00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:39.466
little piece.
My group will do this other

00:33:39.466 --> 00:33:41.186
little piece.
We'll get together over lunch

00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:43.299
and we'll figure out what's
going on, kind of thing.

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:45.829
And they both got the same
kinds of answers.

00:33:45.829 --> 00:33:48.049
They both basically got the
same answers.

00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:51.470
And so, this is one of the
fables.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.800
So, fable: discovery of dark
energy.

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:06.142
And I would say that the moral
here is that replicating

00:34:06.142 --> 00:34:13.233
important results is one of the
things that leads people to

00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:19.591
actually believe what you're
saying--leads to greater

00:34:19.591 --> 00:34:23.494
acceptance.
And it was particularly nice in

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:26.379
this particular case,
because neither of them were

00:34:26.379 --> 00:34:29.768
replicating the others.
They both made the discovery

00:34:29.768 --> 00:34:31.825
independently,
at the same time,

00:34:31.825 --> 00:34:35.806
using a very different kind of
organizational structure and a

00:34:35.806 --> 00:34:38.660
very different approach to their
data.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.860
So, this was kind of compelling.
Okay.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.970
So, here we are,
Δ (m – M),

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:55.190
versus redshift.
Here's Ω _matter = 0.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.284
Ω_λ = 0,
except that,

00:34:58.284 --> 00:35:03.989
in fact, the data--you know,
they kind of look like this.

00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:10.051
So, this is Ω
_matter = 1/4 and

00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:15.173
Ω_λ = 3/4.
And, as you will recall,

00:35:15.173 --> 00:35:19.041
the explanation for this--or,
the first explanation that was

00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:22.581
offered was the fact that
Einstein had this figured out

00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:26.250
eighty years before,
except he decided he was wrong.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:32.430
And so, the first explanation
of this was Einstein's

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:38.975
Cosmological Constant--that's
this symbol, lambda [λ],

00:35:38.975 --> 00:35:44.086
that I keep writing down.
And so, once people believed

00:35:44.086 --> 00:35:47.337
this result, you had to start
worrying about what the heck

00:35:47.337 --> 00:35:52.890
this actually is in real life.
And it has some very peculiar

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.382
properties.
In particular,

00:35:55.382 --> 00:35:59.133
there is the issue of what is
constant about Einstein's

00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:02.260
Cosmological Constant?
So, let me first tell you what

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.160
it is, and then,
I'll tell you why it's so

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.435
bizarre.
The energy density –

00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:18.362
remember, that's the crucial
quantity--of λ is constant as

00:36:18.362 --> 00:36:24.134
the Universe expands.
So, if you take 1 cubic meter

00:36:24.134 --> 00:36:27.062
of space, and you say,
how much dark energy is there

00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:30.527
in this cubic meter of space?
We take an average cubic meter

00:36:30.527 --> 00:36:33.004
of space.
You figure that out by how fast

00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:35.250
the Universe is being pushed
apart.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.352
And then, you know,
you wait 10 billion years,

00:36:37.352 --> 00:36:39.876
or something like that,
until the Universe is very much

00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:42.154
bigger.
And then, you take a cubic

00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:45.140
meter of space,
and you ask yourself how much

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.719
dark energy is in this cubic
meter,

00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:50.880
and you get the same answer,
10 billion years later.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.646
And you got the same answer
now, and you would have gotten

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.540
the same answer 10 billion years
ago.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.930
Very peculiar, right?
Do you see why?

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.829
Think about matter.
You know, the Universe also has

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:06.784
a bunch of matter in it.
All right, so I measure the

00:37:06.784 --> 00:37:10.895
average density of the Universe
in the way we've discussed,

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:15.091
and you get some answer.
So, for matter,

00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:22.090
you can get some density to the
Universe now.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.877
And then, supposing you imagine
in your mind,

00:37:24.877 --> 00:37:28.552
you go back in time when--to
the time when the scale factor

00:37:28.552 --> 00:37:34.543
of the Universe,
when a was half its

00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:40.719
present size,
its present amount.

00:37:40.719 --> 00:37:42.519
But, of course,
you have the same amount of

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:44.573
matter in the Universe.
Matter doesn't--you know,

00:37:44.573 --> 00:37:45.989
in general, it doesn't get
created.

00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:47.557
Or, at least,
you have the same amount of

00:37:47.557 --> 00:37:50.625
matter plus energy.
So, you go back to when you

00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:55.366
have the same amount of matter,
but it's in half the size,

00:37:55.366 --> 00:37:57.945
by which I mean,
1/8 the volume,

00:37:57.945 --> 00:38:02.670
right?
Half squared--half cubed is 1/8.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.562
And so, if I reduce the linear
scale of the Universe by a

00:38:06.562 --> 00:38:09.064
factor of two,
I have 1/8 the volume,

00:38:09.064 --> 00:38:11.150
but same amount of matter.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.690
So rho_then,
which is equal to mass,

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:25.007
which doesn't change,
because there's the same amount

00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:30.646
of mass in the Universe,
which doesn't change,

00:38:30.646 --> 00:38:35.670
divided by volume,
which does change.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:41.269
So, it has to equal eight times
the density_now.

00:38:41.269 --> 00:38:42.889
We've talked about this before,
right?

00:38:42.889 --> 00:38:45.701
The whole deal with the Big
Bang is that if you go back into

00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.179
the past, things were denser
than they were today.

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:52.835
Also hotter,
which is a by-product of the

00:38:52.835 --> 00:38:55.824
density.
You take a big balloon full of

00:38:55.824 --> 00:38:57.320
stuff.
You make it smaller.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.820
The same amount of stuff is in
there.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.229
It's got to be denser inside
the balloon after you've

00:39:01.229 --> 00:39:03.391
squashed it down.
You take a balloon and you

00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:05.974
stretch it out.
If you don't let stuff come in

00:39:05.974 --> 00:39:09.205
or out, then it has to be less
dense--the stuff inside,

00:39:09.205 --> 00:39:12.288
after you've stretched it out.
And then, you get into all

00:39:12.288 --> 00:39:14.760
these nice little thermodynamics
problems where you have,

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.553
pressure is equal to density
times temperature,

00:39:17.553 --> 00:39:22.566
and things like that.
So, all of familiar gas physics

00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:26.108
comes into play.
And so, you expect that the

00:39:26.108 --> 00:39:29.166
density of the Universe is
constantly getting smaller,

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.590
because the Universe is getting
bigger.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.478
And, in fact,
there's extremely good

00:39:33.478 --> 00:39:36.499
empirical evidence of that,
because you look back in time

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:39.264
by looking at distant things.
Sure enough,

00:39:39.264 --> 00:39:44.869
it's denser back then.
But not the dark energy.

00:39:44.869 --> 00:39:51.330
Dark energy density,
at least in Einstein's

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:57.248
conception, is constant.
So, a cubic meter of the

00:39:57.248 --> 00:40:02.284
Universe has the same amount of
dark energy in it now as a cubic

00:40:02.284 --> 00:40:07.001
meter of the Universe did when
the Universe was only a cubic

00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:09.000
meter across,
right?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.680
Where the whole observable
Universe was packed down into a

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.554
cubic meter, that cubic meter
had only as much dark energy in

00:40:16.554 --> 00:40:18.916
it as,
you know, this part of the

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.307
Universe does now.
Very odd behavior,

00:40:22.307 --> 00:40:27.889
but this is what Einstein's
equations predict.

00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:32.418
Now, the thing is,
we don't know that Einstein

00:40:32.418 --> 00:40:35.836
really was right.
We don't, because we don't have

00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:37.829
a clue what the dark energy
actually is.

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:46.568
So let me--so,
λ, the Cosmological Constant,

00:40:46.568 --> 00:40:56.300
suggests that dark energy has
constant density.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.491
But, since we don't know what
the heck this stuff is,

00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:03.460
maybe that's wrong.
Or maybe not.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:10.019
If it's not,
we don't call it λ anymore.

00:41:10.019 --> 00:41:15.420
But if you allow for changes in
the density, you can get very

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.571
interesting potential effects.
And let me--we'll talk about

00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:21.886
this more next time,
but let me just describe one of

00:41:21.886 --> 00:41:23.929
the very strange things that
could happen.

00:41:23.929 --> 00:41:28.536
Suppose it is true--and this is
not ruled out by the data we

00:41:28.536 --> 00:41:36.529
have so far.
Suppose the dark energy density

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:45.210
increases as the Universe gets
bigger.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.599
And since we don't have any
idea what this stuff is,

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:49.661
it might do that,
and we can't rule it out by

00:41:49.661 --> 00:41:52.505
observations just yet.
And so, the Universe gets

00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:55.343
bigger and bigger.
The density of the matter is

00:41:55.343 --> 00:41:58.663
going down, because you have the
same amount of matter in a

00:41:58.663 --> 00:42:01.169
bigger space.
But, supposing we invent some

00:42:01.169 --> 00:42:04.456
kind of dark energy where the
density actually gets bigger as

00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:11.356
the Universe increases in size.
Then, a cubic meter of volume

00:42:11.356 --> 00:42:19.519
has increasing dark energy as
time goes along.

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:25.041
That, of course,
pushes the Universe out faster,

00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:33.217
so the acceleration increases.
That makes the size increase

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:43.000
and you get a feedback as the
Universe exponentially expands.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.400
You get an exponential
expansion.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.174
And as that exponential
expansion increases,

00:42:55.174 --> 00:43:01.724
the amount of dark energy in
any particular cubic meter gets

00:43:01.724 --> 00:43:04.670
bigger too.
And so, what happens?

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.539
After a while,
the dark energy in any cubic

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:11.570
galaxy has become so much that
it blows the galaxy apart.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.119
Gravity can't hold the galaxy
together.

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:16.360
And then, the expansion
continues.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.100
And then, after a while,
the amount of dark energy in

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.050
one cubic star,
if I can use that term,

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.322
in one star becomes so great
that it overcomes the gravity of

00:43:26.322 --> 00:43:28.449
the star and it blows the star
apart.

00:43:28.449 --> 00:43:30.860
And then, the expansion
continues even faster.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.394
And after a while,
the amount of dark energy in a

00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:37.559
cubic meter--that would be a
human being.

00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:42.051
Remember, human beings are
exactly a cubic meter and

00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:46.519
exactly 100 kilograms in mass.
The amount of dark energy in a

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:49.489
human being overcomes the
chemical bonds that hold your

00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:52.239
body together and human beings
get blown apart.

00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:54.534
And eventually,
you have so much dark matter

00:43:54.534 --> 00:43:57.150
that whole atoms--that atoms get
blown to bits,

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.582
and even the sub-atomic
particles that are within them

00:44:00.582 --> 00:44:05.559
eventually get blown to bits.
And so, dark energy conquers

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:08.950
all.
This is described as the Big

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:14.570
Rip, and it is kind of an
alternative hypothesis of what

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:20.002
might happen to the Universe,
that stems from an alternative

00:44:20.002 --> 00:44:23.823
hypothesis of what the dark
energy is, that there's no

00:44:23.823 --> 00:44:28.150
particular reason to believe,
but that hasn't been disproved.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.143
And since there's no particular
reason to believe anything else,

00:44:31.143 --> 00:44:33.519
you can amuse your students by
talking about it.

00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:38.782
So, to summarize this,
here is--it's all a question of

00:44:38.782 --> 00:44:43.040
the scale factor versus time.
Here is now.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.829
Here is 1.
Here is an empty Universe.

00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:49.944
We thought that what would
happen is that it would look

00:44:49.944 --> 00:44:52.309
like this, and either collapse,
or not.

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:57.342
What actually happened is,
it turns out,

00:44:57.342 --> 00:45:01.682
things look like this.
We only really observe it in

00:45:01.682 --> 00:45:04.344
the past, so there's a whole
bunch of supernovae proving that

00:45:04.344 --> 00:45:06.797
that's true.
And you can extrapolate a kind

00:45:06.797 --> 00:45:09.300
of gentle expansion that looks
like this.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:17.590
This is the standard model with
a Cosmological Constant.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:22.298
But if you assume that things
get even bigger--that the dark

00:45:22.298 --> 00:45:25.489
energy increases per volume with
time,

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:29.165
then you asymptotically go to
infinity at some time in the

00:45:29.165 --> 00:45:31.680
future and you blow everything
apart.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.295
Not ruled out.
And so, people are anxious to

00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:39.498
discover whether that,
or some other set of crazy

00:45:39.498 --> 00:45:43.303
ideas, might be true.
And we'll talk about how people

00:45:43.303 --> 00:45:47.000
are going about trying to nail
this down next time.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.167
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: We're
talking about nucleophilic 

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.167
substitution reactions. 

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:10.233
And today we're going to talk,
in the next lecture as well, 

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.900
about mechanistic tools. 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.333
How you find out what the
mechanism is. 

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.767
You can talk about plausible
mechanism, but whether that's 

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.167
really it or not, and almost
always there are several, 

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.867
requires experimentation. 

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:26.600
So we're going to look at
experimental tools you can use 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.433
to decide what the mechanism of
the reaction is. 

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:33.067
So last time we saw a whole
bunch of examples of 

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.833
nucleophilic substitution
reactions, where a nucleophile 

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:42.100
approaches a compound that has a
low LUMO, the substrate. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.800
It reacts in a particular
solvent to give the product in 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.900
which the nucleophile has
replaced the leaving group. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.867
So now we're interested in what
the mechanism of that is. 

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:57.100
We talked last semester about
the possibility of attacking 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.633
on the carbon of the sigma-star,
and the leaving 

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.900
group leaving with the electrons
that were formerly 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.333
in the R-L bond. 

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.333
That's certainly plausible, the
question is 

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.300
whether it's true. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.467
Because as you'll see, there are
other 

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.300
possibilities as well. 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.733
So there are many different
mechanisms. In fact they're 

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.233
not all the same. 

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.733
But many of them fall in the
same two 

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.767
classes as you'll see. 

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:25.200
And the one we're going to talk
about first is called 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.400
nucleophilic substitution, SN. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.267
Substitution, nucleophilic 2
means second order in 

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.033
kinetics, and you'll see what
that means. 

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.100
So SN2, nucleophilic
substitution. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.667
And we're interested, as I said
in the pragmatic logic of 

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.667
proving a mechanism with
experiment and theory. 

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.833
Now this kind of logic isn't
like the logic they teach you 

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.500
in philosophy or mathematics. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.000
Things are rarely 100% proven. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.133
But there's a practical use to
know how these things work, 

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:02.200
because they can help you in
designing new reactions, or 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.467
changing the conditions to make
a reaction work better. 

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.733
So you'll see what it means to
prove a 

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.367
mechanism in organic chemistry.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:14.400
And actually, mostly it involves
disproving all the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.067
alternative mechanisms. You
remember Sherlock Holmes in 

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:21.333
The Adventure of the Beryl
Coronet, said "It's an old 

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.800
maxim of mine, that when you
have excluded the impossible, 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.900
truth." That's generally the
logic of how you prove things 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.367
in chemistry. 

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:38.600
But the problem is you have to
disprove "all the alternative 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.500
mechanisms, which means you have
to imagine all the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.900
alternative mechanisms in
disprovement. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.533
Of course it's always a
possibility that there's one 

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:52.100
you haven't thought of that's
the real McCoy. 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.867
Now let's just look at what has
to happen. 

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:57.300
You have to break the R-L bond,
leaving group has to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.433
leave, and you have to make the
new bond. 

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:02.867
So there has to be a
dissociation and there has to 

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.500
be an association. 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.900
And you could classify the
possible mechanisms in the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.000
sequence that's involved in
these two processes. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.567
You could first have
dissociation, and then 

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:15.933
association. 

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:18.067
And we'll see that actually
happens-- 

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:20.767
that's called the SN1 reaction.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.933
You can have association
followed by dissociation, 

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:28.767
which happens, but not with
carbon. 

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:32.333
And you'll see also the
possibility of a simultaneous 

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.300
or a concerted reaction as you
call it, where you make the 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.400
new bond at the same time you
break the old one, so that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.833
they come at the same time. 

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:44.433
That seems to pretty much cover
the territory of 

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.600
how you can do it. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.700
So you can have concerted, where
they both happen at the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.667
same time,
association/dissociation, or 

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:54.300
dissociation followed by
association. 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.100
And we can imagine
reaction-coordinate diagrams

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.367
for these, and geometries.

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:02.367
So in the concerted, the
nucleophile is coming in and 

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.133
attacking the carbon at the same
time the leaving group is 

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.367
leaving, and that's a transition
state. 

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.367
You can have a pentavalent
carbon intermediate. 

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.700
So you first make the new bond,
and only subsequently do 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.267
you break the old bond. 

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:19.600
Or you could break the old bond,
and get a trivalent 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.500
intermediate, and then
subsequently 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
make the new bond. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.533
So if we look at the reaction
coordinate diagram, the first 

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.700
one just has a transition state,
but the other two have 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.000
intermediates. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.400
Either a pentavalent
intermediate of pentavalent 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.967
carbon, or a trivalent carbon
intermediate. 

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.933
As I've drawn it there, the
first step is rate limiting. 

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:47.300
We talked about the complex
reaction of two steps, where 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.233
either the first or the second
step would be rate limiting. 

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:52.767
It would be possible to imagine
the second step to be 

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:54.967
rate limiting as well. 

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:58.133
However, that might not be so
common. 

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:02.800
We will ask what's normally the
case in a reaction. 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300
These ones where the second step
has a higher barrier are 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.300
not so common if you have an
exothermic process because 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.467
it's against the Hammond
postulate. 

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.367
Not that it couldn't be, because
you have the 

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:22.467
intermediate, and you can go
either to the product or back 

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.700
to the starting material. 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.600
But if the second step is rate
limiting, it implies that you 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.433
have a higher barrier going to
the lower energy product, 

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.500
which could be, but it's not so
likely. 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.233
So it's much more likely to have
these up at the top in a 

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:39.967
reaction that's exothermic. 

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:44.200
Of course the same reaction run
backwards would retrace 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.300
the same path, and running this
backwards would have the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.867
second step rate limiting. 

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:51.000
But generally we're going to
talk about cases where the 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.267
first step is rate limiting,
because we're interested in 

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:56.333
reactions that go to give a
product, not the ones that 

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.833
come back from the product and
the starting material so much. 

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:04.633
Now if you have three different
other substituents 

00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:07.367
on the carbon that's being
attacked, other than the 

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:11.567
leaving group that's leaving,
then you have the possibility 

00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:13.167
of chirality. 

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:16.767
So that the first transition
state and the pentavalent 

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:18.300
intermediate are chiral. 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.800
But the trivalent intermediate,
if it's planar, 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.667
is achiral. 

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:28.233
And that means that there are
stereochemical implications. 

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:32.433
Because in the first two cases
the nucleophile comes on the 

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.000
opposite face from where the
leaving group is leaving. 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.367
But in the third case when you
have the trivalent 

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.933
intermediate it could do that,
but it could also come in from 

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:43.400
the other side. 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.900
So you would get two
enantiomers. 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.700
So the stereochemical
consequences, the 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.933
stereochemistry of the product,
whether it's inverted 

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:57.200
from the starting material, or
whether it's racemic, you 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.200
attack both sides, will tell you

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.567
something about the mechanism. 

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:04.667
I suppose if we want to be
complete in our thinking about 

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.967
this, we could also imagine that
there would be a 

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:10.533
frontside attack where the
nucleophile would come in on 

00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:15.733
the same face that the leaving
group is leaving, either in a 

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:20.500
concerted process, or in a
process with a pentavalent 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.067
intermediate, where nucleophile
and leaving group 

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.533
are on the same side. 

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:27.833
That's a possibility, which
isn't shown here. 

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:31.667
But whichever it is, whether
it's the same side or the 

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:34.100
opposite side, the first two
cases are going to give a 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.267
single chirality to the product,
where the trivalent 

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:41.100
intermediate will give both. 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.467
There are tools for testing,
that is for excluding 

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:49.200
mechanisms. They can involve
stereochemistry, rate law, 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.800
rate constant, and structure
(X-ray work and quantum 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.367
mechanics). 

00:07:55.367 --> 00:07:59.133
In the particular book that you
might be using, the Jones 

00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:01.700
book, these are in the sections
indicated there, and 

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.567
I'll indicate those as we go
along. 

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:06.300
But these things will be covered
in all the texts, so 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.833
you'll see a good treatment
almost anywhere. 

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.300
We're first going to look at
stereochemistry, what we were 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.000
just talking about. 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.500
So when you have nucleophilic
substitution, where the 

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.933
nucleophile comes in place of
the leaving group, it could 

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.867
either do exactly that-- 

00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:28.700
it could REplace the leaving
group, so the nucleophile is 

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.567
on the right in the product, the
same way that the leaving 

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:34.233
group was on the right in the
starting material, so they 

00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:36.567
just change positions. 

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:41.633
Or it could be a DISplacement,
where the nucleophile comes in 

00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:44.833
on the opposite side, and the
things that make 

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:47.300
it chiral are inverted. 

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.233
You could imagine either way. 

00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:53.567
If you were naive and in the
nineteenth century, which do 

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.900
you think you would think more
likely? 

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.300
That it would actually replace
the thing that it was 

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.700
exchanging with, or that it
would come in and invert 

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.433
everything? 

00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:07.767
Which do you think you would
have thought was more likely? 

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:09.733
How many would think it more
likely if you're going to 

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:12.533
replace something, you replace
it? 

00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.367
How many think it would displace
it? 

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:18.300
That's exactly what they thought
in the 19th century, 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.000
that it should be replacement
not displacement. 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.533
So when it was found in 1898
that there was an example, 

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:31.233
where it inverted the
configuration, Emil Fischer, 

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:34.367
the guy who invented the Fischer
projection after all, 

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:37.833
who was a big expert on
stereochemistry at the turn of 

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:42.000
the century, said this was "the
most astounding discovery in 

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.433
stereochemistry since the
groundbreaking work of van 't 

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:49.433
Hoff." which was a quarter
century earlier. 

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.600
So it was really astounding to
these people that it could 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.300
invert the stereochemistry. 

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.300
They thought this weird case
that showed that, was just 

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.333
that-- a weird case. 

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:02.167
But the normal case must be
replacement. 

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.967
So the goal then was to find out
which one was normal. 

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:12.200
The first really good evidence
on this, and a beautiful 

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.900
experiment, was done in England
by Kenyon 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.600
and Phillips in 1923. 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.567
And it involved this alcohol,
and they resolved it, and got 

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:25.433
a single enantiomer which
rotated light 33 degrees plus, 

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.800
to the right. 

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.967
Now they want to do a
substitution reaction, replace 

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:36.600
the OH by something else, and
see whether the configuration 

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.333
is the same or whether it's been
inverted. 

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:45.267
Notice incidentally that if in
doing the process you do two 

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:48.900
steps you'll get the same
ultimate product, whether it's 

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.200
two inversions, or two
retentions of configuration. 

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.400
They'll both give the same
product. 

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.100
So you have to have just one
step that involves the 

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.867
nucleophilic substitution
reaction. 

00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:06.033
So now in the first place, OH
minus, as we'll see later in 

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:07.800
the lecture is a crummy leaving
group. 

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.300
You can't undergo the
replacement 

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.400
reaction easily with OH. 

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.900
So what they did first, was to
react it with this 

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.700
chlorosulfonic acid. 

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.700
And this is indeed a
nucleophilic substitution, 

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.233
where O attacks sulfur this
time, not carbon, 

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:28.133
and chloride leaves. 

00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:31.300
So now you have a product where
the group attached to 

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.733
the chiral carbon, is not OH but
O with sulfur on it. 

00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:40.400
Notice incidentally that nothing
happened to the chiral 

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.767
carbon at this stage. 

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.633
The reaction was at the oxygen.

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:46.067
So whatever configuration of the
carbon you had in the 

00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:47.933
starting material, you have in
the product. 

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:52.100
This is not an interesting
reaction stereochemically. 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.267
It's just the way to get there
to be a group that'll leave. 

00:11:56.267 --> 00:12:00.800
And notice that this mechanism
is A/D. It's first 

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.167
association, attack the sulfur,
and then dissociation, 

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.600
lose the chloride. 

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.700
And the reason you could do that
is that there's a vacant 

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.100
d orbital on the sulfur. 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.633
So there's a way that you can
form a new bond without 

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:15.600
breaking the old one. 

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.100
You don't have to attack
sigma-star. 

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.000
And once you have this product,
that now is a good 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.967
leaving group, because if you
break the bond between carbon 

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:29.467
and oxygen, now the anion you
get is not OH minus, but an 

00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:36.633
anion analogous to the anion of
sulfuric acid, OSO2 Now 

00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:40.467
that has a rotation of +31
degrees, and the starting 

00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:44.400
material was +33 degrees, so
that confirms what we were 

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.367
saying, that the configuration
hasn't changed 

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.800
at the chiral carbon. 

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.067
Am I right? 

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:51.300
Is that a good inference? 

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:56.900
That it's + at the product and +
at the starting material? 

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.467
Does that prove that the carbon
didn't turn inside out? 

00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:06.533
How many think it proved it, or
at least supported it? 

00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:09.067
How many think it had nothing to
do with it? 

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:09.467
Right. 

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.900
Because they're different
compounds and who knows how 

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.633
they're going to rotate light,
so that 

00:13:13.633 --> 00:13:15.467
doesn't prove anything. 

00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:17.867
Now we're going to do the
nucleophilic substitution 

00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:21.900
reaction where the anion is
acetate. 

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.100
And it's going to attack the
carbon, and break the bond 

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.300
from carbon. So the nucleophile
attacks, the 

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.633
leaving group leaves. 

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.767
This is the reaction we're
interested in, whether it 

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:32.600
inverts the configuration. 

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.400
And we find out that we get that
product, and that's the 

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.567
nucleophilic substitution at
saturated carbon. 

00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:43.167
And the rotation of that product
is -7 degrees. 

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.467
So it was an inversion right? 

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:48.133
It shows that the carbon turned
inside out, because 

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:51.733
it's opposite the starting
material, right? 

00:13:51.733 --> 00:13:54.200
I hear you say-- 

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.867
wrong! 

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:57.000
Because it has nothing to do
with it. 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.267
Same as the first step. 

00:13:58.267 --> 00:13:59.333
So we don't really know. 

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:01.567
That proves nothing. 

00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:06.300
The only way we're going to
prove is to get a product 

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.133
that's exactly the same as the
starting material, except for 

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.333
the possibility of
configuration. 

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:14.700
Then we'll know if it's the
mirror image, but we can't use 

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.100
any derivative. 

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.800
So what we needed to do is
change that OCOCH3 into OH. 

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.167
And you can do that. 

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:28.700
You can bring in hydroxide,
attack the carbonyl carbon, 

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:35.600
which generates this
intermediate, and then that 

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.133
can do this reaction, breaking
the CO bond and 

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:41.100
generate that anion. 

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.800
Now there's another product, of
course. 

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.800
The top right of the molecule is
this. 

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.267
It's got OHCCH3, and then that
becomes a double bond. 

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.100
So it's acetic acid. 

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.167
Incidentally, notice this is a
substitution reaction too. 

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:01.267
The reaction across the top was
a substitution. 

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.600
The reaction coming down was a
substitution. 

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.767
The reaction going at the bottom
is a substitution. 

00:15:07.767 --> 00:15:11.200
But the top was a substitution
at sulfur. 

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.333
The coming down was the one
we're interested in, 

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:15.600
substitution at a saturated
carbon. 

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.000
The one going across is
substitution 

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.467
at a carbonyl carbon. 

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:21.567
That one. 

00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:26.433
So OH minus comes in, and this
anion comes off. 

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:30.867
But again it's possible to do
that by association first, and 

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:34.467
then dissociation, because
there's that vacant pi-star 

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:36.133
orbital that you can go in
without 

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.967
breaking anything away. 

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:41.333
So we're not interested in the
one on the top and the one on 

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:43.367
the bottom, we're interested in
that one that 

00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:44.733
comes down the side. 

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:46.567
That's the reaction were
interested in. 

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:51.367
Nucleophilic substitution at
saturated carbon. 

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.800
Now notice the product. 

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.500
Remember that was an acid and
this was an anion. 

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.700
But of course this is a stronger
acid than hydroxide, 

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.133
so the proton will be
transferred in this direction. 

00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:05.000
And now we have a product which
is the same as the 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.267
starting material, except
possibly for its 

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.167
configuration. 

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:14.233
So the question is, "Is it the
same as the starting material?"

00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:19.567
Is the normal course of the
reaction a replacement or a 

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:21.933
displacement? 

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:26.833
And the rotation is -32, where
it was +33 before. 

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:29.500
That's experimental error in the
difference. 

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.633
So it's a displacement. 

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:33.767
It inverted the configuration. 

00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:37.700
And so we know that in this kind
of reaction, backside 

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.500
attack on the carbon, the kind
we anticipated, although 

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.167
nobody could have thought about
it in 1923, on the basis 

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:50.433
of a sigma-star orbital being
attacked where it's big. 

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:53.033
So backside attack in
nucleophilic substitution at 

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:54.267
saturated carbon. 

00:16:54.267 --> 00:16:57.667
And notice in this scheme that's
the only case where you 

00:16:57.667 --> 00:16:59.233
broke a bond to that carbon. 

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:01.867
That's the beauty and the design
of this scheme. 

00:17:01.867 --> 00:17:03.967
Now there's another nice feature
in the 

00:17:03.967 --> 00:17:04.767
design of this scheme. 

00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:07.367
It looks a little clunky,
actually to have to do all 

00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:08.500
those things. 

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.233
And you might wonder. "Why not
avoid all that stuff going 

00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:17.800
around the bottom by just doing
hydroxide attacking this 

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.700
sulfonate ester?" 

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.233
Because if you brought hydroxide
in there you'd get 

00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:27.433
this product, and you'd do it
without all this stuff. 

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:29.300
But there was a reason in the
experimental 

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.767
design they did that. 

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:35.033
Because if you use hydroxide, a
much stronger base than 

00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:39.400
acetate is, then it turns out it
attacks that hydrogen, and 

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.433
pulls it off, when the leaving
group leaves. 

00:17:42.433 --> 00:17:45.267
So you generate a double bond
there. 

00:17:45.267 --> 00:17:46.933
So you don't get the product. 

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:49.067
And of course that stuff is
achiral, not 

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:51.433
that you really care. 

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:54.300
But you don't do the reaction if
you use hydroxide, so they 

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.733
had to use acetate. 

00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:58.300
So this was a very clever
experimental design, and 

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.600
proved that inversion is the
normal course, backside attack 

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.300
on the carbon. 

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.533
So inversion. 

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:13.300
The trivalent intermediate could
have been attacked from 

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.633
either face, and would have
given racemic product. 

00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:19.067
So we can be confident that in
this case 

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:21.467
that's not the mechanism. 

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.333
That doesn't mean there couldn't
be a case where it's 

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:26.133
the mechanism, but it's not the
mechanism in this kind of 

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:29.933
case, and things that are
related to it. 

00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:33.000
So stereochemistry is a good
tool, and it shows inversion. 

00:18:35.867 --> 00:18:42.967
Which means that it's not a
concerted frontside attack, 

00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:46.200
not a pentavalent intermediate
where the nucleophile came in 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.933
on the same side the leaving
group was leaving. 

00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:51.400
And it also means that you can't
have had the trivalent 

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.333
intermediate. 

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:55.733
Now let's look at the rate law,
and what it can tell us. 

00:18:55.733 --> 00:18:58.333
How the rate depends on
concentration. 

00:18:58.333 --> 00:19:03.333
So this reaction I'm showing
here is ethoxide anion attacking

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.333
ethyl bromide. 

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.533
So the ethoxide replaces bromide
as the leaving group. 

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:10.367
And we're looking at the rate of
forming the product or 

00:19:10.367 --> 00:19:14.700
losing the starting material as
a function of how much the 

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.967
concentration of ethoxide is. 

00:19:16.967 --> 00:19:18.067
And we're going to fix the 

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:20.100
concentration of ethyl bromide.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.067
It's assumed that ethyl bromide,
which is the subject 

00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:25.000
of this whole thing, that rate's
going to be 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.367
proportional to it. 

00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:29.833
The question is, is the rate
proportional to ethoxide? 

00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:33.000
So you plot the rate as a
function of ethoxide, and you 

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.367
get a line that looks like that.

00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:37.267
So it's a second order rate law.

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:40.100
It's proportional to how much
ethyl bromide you have, and 

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.300
it's proportional how much
ethoxide you have. So both of 

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.733
those things must be in the rate

00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:46.467
determining transition state. 

00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:49.633
Both the ethoxide and the ethyl
bromide. 

00:19:49.633 --> 00:19:53.867
Now there's something funny
about this plot. 

00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:55.100
Do you see what it is? 

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.933
It's nice and linear, so it's
first order in ethoxide. 

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:05.033
But what else? 

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:05.300
Ayesha? 

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.567
STUDENT: It doesn't start from
zero. 

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:09.167
PROFESSOR: It doesn't start at
zero. 

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.033
If you don't have any 

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:13.667
ethoxide, you get the reaction.

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:16.933
How can that be? 

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:20.467
It's because, although it's
second order-- 

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.300
Wait a second. 

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.000
What just happened? 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.667
Did I press the wrong button? 

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:28.767
This was just to say about the
second order. 

00:20:28.767 --> 00:20:31.100
Sorry I got out of whack here. 

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.900
So the initial rate-limiting
dissociation in the 

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.800
dissocation/association would
give a rate independent of 

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.033
nucleophile, this one. 

00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:42.733
Because the first step doesn't
involve the nucleophile. 

00:20:42.733 --> 00:20:44.533
Only the second step. 

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:47.933
So if the rate-limiting step
depends on nucleophile, it 

00:20:47.933 --> 00:20:49.233
can't be this mechanism. 

00:20:49.233 --> 00:20:52.033
So we could exclude it on this
basis, as well as on the 

00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:53.300
stereochemistry. 

00:20:56.867 --> 00:20:59.300
Back to this, we have the
problem that 

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.533
Ayesha brought up. 

00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:03.467
How can you get the product if
there's no ethoxide? 

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:10.433
So there must be a reaction
that's going on all the time, 

00:21:10.433 --> 00:21:12.567
whether you have ethoxide or
not. 

00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.633
And then another reaction that
depends on ethoxide. 

00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:16.867
What's that first reaction? 

00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:22.600
It doesn't depend on the
concentration of ethoxide, so 

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.100
it seems to be a first order
process. 

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.333
It's constant. 

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.733
First order could be
dissociation followed by 

00:21:31.733 --> 00:21:34.967
association, so there could be
some of that 

00:21:34.967 --> 00:21:37.000
going on all the time. 

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.200
And then a little bit of this
where the ethoxide attacks, 

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.000
getting more and more as you
have a higher 

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.900
concentration of ethoxide. 

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.100
But that's not what it is. 

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.933
This is done in ethanol solvent.

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:53.133
So the unshared pair on the
oxygen of the solvent can 

00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:57.133
attack, the same way the
unshared pair on ethoxide can. 

00:21:57.133 --> 00:22:00.767
Of course the ethoxide has a
much higher HOMO because of 

00:22:00.767 --> 00:22:04.300
its negative charge, so it will
react faster. 

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.133
But there's a lot of the ethanol
there compared to how 

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:09.867
much ethoxide, especially here
at the beginning when you 

00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:13.267
don't have any ethoxide at all.

00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:17.567
So actually that second process
is a pseudo first 

00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:18.933
order reaction. 

00:22:18.933 --> 00:22:21.667
It depends on the concentration
of ethanol. 

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:26.067
But ethanol solvent's
concentration is constant. 

00:22:26.067 --> 00:22:29.167
So it appears to be first order.

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:34.333
But it's actually a pseudo first
order process where the 

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:38.333
first order rate constant is
k-pseudo times the 

00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:43.233
concentration of ethanol, which
is not changing. 

00:22:43.233 --> 00:22:46.500
So now we have these two
possible reactions, ethoxide 

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.533
or ethanol, unshared pair,
attacking the sigma-star of 

00:22:50.533 --> 00:22:51.767
ethyl bromide. 

00:22:53.567 --> 00:22:59.033
We can tell at this point here,
when it's half and half, 

00:22:59.033 --> 00:23:02.933
half the mechanism is pseudo
first order, half the rate is 

00:23:02.933 --> 00:23:04.400
the second order. 

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.100
Then we know that whatever the
difference in these rate 

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.467
constants is, is made up by the
difference in 

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:15.533
concentration, so that they have
the same rate. 

00:23:15.533 --> 00:23:18.667
That is, there's enough
ethoxide, a small amount of 

00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:22.133
ethoxide with a much higher rate
constant, so it has the 

00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:24.933
same overall rate as the pseudo
first order rate 

00:23:24.933 --> 00:23:26.000
constant does. 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.533
And from that you can figure out
that the second order rate 

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:32.800
constant is 20,000 times faster
than 

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.500
first order rate constant. 

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.833
So this is 20,000 times faster
than that. 

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:40.533
Now does that make sense to you?

00:23:40.533 --> 00:23:41.433
Yeah, it does. 

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:46.233
Because you'd expect the much
higher HOMO of the anion to 

00:23:46.233 --> 00:23:47.833
attack more rapidly. 

00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:49.667
How much more rapidly? 

00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:53.067
Do you have any way of measuring
how reactive these 

00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:55.433
two things should be? 

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:56.900
These two HOMOs? 

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.300
Any way of measuring how high
the relative height of those 

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.333
two HOMOs, and their ability to
form a bond. 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.267
Hint it's what we talked about
in the last lecture. 

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600
Debby? 

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.567
STUDENT: pKa. 

00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:15.600
PROFESSOR: pKa. 

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.833
How different are they in
attacking a proton. 

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:26.400
So, the analogy to that is
attacking protons. 

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.167
And that's an equilibrium that's
easy to measure by the 

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.500
way we did last time. 

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:39.900
We find out that their pKa's
differ by 17.5 powers of ten. 

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.900
Here they differ by only a
little more 

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.167
than 4 powers of ten. 

00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:49.233
So you might expect it to be
even bigger, the difference. 

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:53.400
But in fact this is measured in
equilibrium. 

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.667
When you've completely formed
the bond. 

00:24:56.667 --> 00:25:00.133
Whereas in the nucleophilic
substitution, we're only at a 

00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:01.233
transition state. 

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:03.900
We haven't completely formed the
bond. 

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.467
So you don't expect it to be as
big a difference by the 

00:25:07.467 --> 00:25:08.933
Hammond postulate kind of thing.

00:25:08.933 --> 00:25:10.500
You're only part of the way
across. 

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.500
Not all the way. 

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:18.000
So it's maybe not surprising
that seems a plausible rate 

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.633
constant ratio. 

00:25:20.633 --> 00:25:21.767
So that makes sense. 

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:26.567
So the rate law then, shows that
it can't be dissociation 

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:30.767
first, because that wouldn't
depend on how much nucleophile 

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:31.700
you have there. 

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.500
Nor can it be frontside attack,
either concerted or 

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.867
pentavalent intermediate and
then lose the leaving group. 

00:25:38.867 --> 00:25:44.200
It has to be from the backside.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.233
Another thing you can test, is
not just how it depends on 

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:51.400
concentration, but what the rate
constant is. 

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.300
In fact we just looked in the
last slide at whether these 

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.100
rate constants were plausible
for a higher 

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.800
HOMO and a lower HOMO. 

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.300
So the rate constant will
depend, certainly on what the 

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.067
nucleophile is, ethoxide versus
ethanol. 

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.900
But it will also depend on what
R is, what the leaving 

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.700
group is, what the solvent is. 

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.200
It also may be on the nature of
the product. 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.267
For example whether the product
is charged or not. 

00:26:21.267 --> 00:26:25.133
So all of these things will
influence the rate constant, 

00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:28.433
and we're going to look at the
whole set of them, one at a 

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:32.433
time, and see whether these tell
us something about the 

00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:34.133
mechanism of the reaction. 

00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:37.300
First let's look at the
substrate, the R group. 

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.733
Here are different R's, and the
relative rate constant for 

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:51.500
how fast they get attacked by
iodide in acetone solvent at 

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.867
room temperature, when bromide
is the leaving group. 

00:26:54.867 --> 00:27:01.067
So this is how the relative
rates as we change R. We'll 

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:04.767
call ethyl 1. 

00:27:04.767 --> 00:27:06.733
Then, methyl is much faster. 

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.800
But propyl is about the same
rate. 

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.367
Isopropyl is ever so much
slower. 

00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:26.667
The isobutyl is faster again. 

00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:29.367
t-butyl is very slow. 

00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:32.333
In fact, you don't know how slow
it is. 

00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:34.333
It's got to be slower than that.

00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:37.467
Because something else happens
other than the reaction we're 

00:27:37.467 --> 00:27:37.800
talking about. 

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.667
So all you know is it can't be
any faster than that. 

00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:48.167
And neopentyl is really, really
slow. 

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:52.000
Now, do these make sense? 

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.967
Let's look at it in two ways. 

00:27:53.967 --> 00:27:57.033
First we could have substituents
on the alpha 

00:27:57.033 --> 00:28:00.067
carbon, the carbon that has the
leaving group on it. 

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:04.300
And notice here we add one
methyl group to that carbon. 

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.433
Here we've added two methyl
groups to that carbon. 

00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:08.967
Here we've added three methyl
groups to that carbon. 

00:28:08.967 --> 00:28:11.433
So we can have
alpha-substitution. 

00:28:11.433 --> 00:28:13.667
But we can also have
beta-substitution. 

00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:15.733
We can add methyls to this
carbon. 

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:17.767
Here we put one methyl on that
carbon. 

00:28:17.767 --> 00:28:20.467
Here we put two methyls on that
second carbon. 

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:23.233
Here we put three methyls on
that second carbon. 

00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:26.733
So we can try to classify it as
we put extra methyls on a 

00:28:26.733 --> 00:28:28.400
particular carbon. 

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.633
So those are the
beta-substituents, for 

00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:33.767
example, one, two, or three
methyl groups on that 

00:28:33.767 --> 00:28:35.000
beta-carbon. 

00:28:36.633 --> 00:28:41.400
Now notice that as we put a
methyl group on the 

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.500
alpha-carbon, the first carbon,
we add a methyl group 

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.767
to it in place of hydrogen. 

00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:54.967
As we add it, it decreases the
rate by 145 times. 

00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:57.533
So there's a higher activation
energy, enough to 

00:28:57.533 --> 00:29:01.233
slow it by 145 fold. 

00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:03.500
Now let's put a second one on. 

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.567
That slows it down by 128. 

00:29:06.567 --> 00:29:08.533
Another factor of 128. 

00:29:08.533 --> 00:29:09.633
About the same. 

00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:13.433
So the influence of the first
methyl group in slowing it 

00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:16.200
down is about the same as the
influence of the 

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.467
second methyl group. 

00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:19.233
How about the third methyl
group? 

00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:20.500
Do you see what it does? 

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:27.633
So that means it's raising the
activation energy by about the 

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.067
same amount each time you do
that. 

00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:32.433
So you might think that the
third one would do it by that 

00:29:32.433 --> 00:29:39.233
amount, but in fact all you know
is that it's 

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:41.267
greater than 15 times. 

00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:43.567
You can't really measure it
because 

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:45.567
something else happens. 

00:29:45.567 --> 00:29:47.600
Now let's look at the same thing
with respect to the 

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.200
beta-hydrogen. 

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.000
The first one slows it down
almost not at all. 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.367
From 1 to 0.82. 

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:56.667
Only by a factor of 1.2. 

00:29:56.667 --> 00:30:00.367
The second one slows it down by
a factor of twenty three. 

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:03.200
But how about the third one? 

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.367
Slows it by 3,000 fold! 

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:10.200
Why does the third one make so
much difference, where the 

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.733
first two don't make much
difference of adding those 

00:30:12.733 --> 00:30:14.767
methyl groups? 

00:30:14.767 --> 00:30:19.200
Well here's the case in methyl
with bromide ready to leave, 

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.367
and we have to attack the
backside. 

00:30:21.367 --> 00:30:23.800
Or let us suppose we're
attacking the backside, which 

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.567
seems plausible on the basis of
the stereochemistry and the 

00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:29.300
rate constant. 

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.533
That means we're attacking that
LUMO. 

00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:35.667
Now let's look at that same
thing in the case of the 

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.533
alpha-substitution. 

00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:41.000
There's that-- between the red
and the second blue is the 

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.567
anti-bonding node that's going
to break. 

00:30:44.567 --> 00:30:47.767
Here's the surface potential. 

00:30:47.767 --> 00:30:51.033
The blue area is a good place to
put an anion, 

00:30:51.033 --> 00:30:53.233
so that makes sense. 

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:58.767
So we have methyl, ethyl,
isopropyl, and t-butyl. 

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:01.400
Let's look at the total electron
densities. 

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.267
Notice methyl, the arrow, gets
there OK. 

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:05.633
Ethyl gets there OK. 

00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:08.100
Although it's bumping into this
thing at the back a 

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.100
little bit, but it could lean
forward just a little bit to 

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.367
avoid that. 

00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:15.233
Here it's getting in trouble. 

00:31:15.233 --> 00:31:19.900
That slows it down by a factor
of 23. 

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.433
Oh. 

00:31:20.433 --> 00:31:20.767
Let's see. 

00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:22.067
I've got the wrong one. 

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:25.033
This was 100, that's another
factor of a hundred-- 

00:31:25.033 --> 00:31:29.367
But this one is a much bigger
factor because you just can't 

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:30.833
get there now when you have
three. 

00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:34.767
So the third one is what really
stops it. 

00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:36.700
And this is called steric
hindrance. 

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.033
The space gets in the way. 

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:42.800
So that's the effect of
alpha-methylation. 

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.367
Let's look at the LUMO. 

00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:47.267
It looks pretty complicated. 

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:49.833
The reason I put it up is not to
look at that, but to look 

00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:53.200
at that one orbital in the
context of the total 

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.900
electronic density. 

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.567
So there it is at 0.06 contour.

00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:00.567
And now I'll put the total
electron density there, and 

00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:03.900
look through that to see how
much we can see of that LUMO 

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.600
that we need to attack. 

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.800
So you see, you can really see
it here. 

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.167
You could see it a little bit
here, and a little bit here, 

00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:14.033
but you can't see it at all from
the backside here. 

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:16.233
So this one is going to be shut
down. 

00:32:18.733 --> 00:32:22.367
And there's the surface
potential, and you see even 

00:32:22.367 --> 00:32:25.300
the surface potential isn't as
good here as it is in the 

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.633
other ones for the anion to come
in and attack. 

00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:31.967
Now let's look at the
beta-methylation, where we 

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:39.100
have this carbon, and we start
putting one, two or 

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.800
three on that one. 

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.900
And here are the rates remember.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.967
One, 0.82, 0.036, and then
0.000012. 

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.500
Why is the third one so bad? 

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.367
Well you see this one can get in
there. 

00:32:55.367 --> 00:32:57.667
That one can get in there just
as well, because this methyl 

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:00.700
group, the substituent is out of
the way. 

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.167
You can put two of them out of
the way, but the third one you 

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:05.267
can't get out of the way. 

00:33:05.267 --> 00:33:07.767
Once you have three, there's no
way to avoid it. 

00:33:07.767 --> 00:33:10.633
So that one gets slowed way
down. 

00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:13.867
No way to avoid the third
beta-methyl group. 

00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:17.167
There you can see that you can't
get any place near the 

00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:20.367
really good blue areas. 

00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:25.633
So this is consistent with the
idea that you have a 

00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:29.100
transition state that involves
backside attack. 

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.000
Not the planar intermediate. 

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.233
Now there's a question. 

00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:37.267
Might it be possible to have
frontside attack. 

00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:41.333
Might it be just easier to do
backside, but you could do 

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:45.500
frontside attack if the other
one weren't faster? 

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.733
How hard is it to do frontside
attack? 

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:52.667
So is this possible? 

00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:59.800
Or is it possible to form a
cation that's not planar? 

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.333
So could you have it bent, and
not planar, so that the 

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.633
stereochemical consequences
would not 

00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:08.433
necessarily be inversion. 

00:34:08.433 --> 00:34:11.800
Might it be possible to have a
non-planar cation as an 

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.467
intermediate? 

00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:16.367
But remember that BH3, which has
the same 

00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:20.967
electrons that CH3+ does. 

00:34:20.967 --> 00:34:23.833
Remember we talked last semester
about XH3, that when 

00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:28.333
that's a cation, or in BH3, you
expect it to be planar, 

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:33.567
but still might not be too bad
to have bent. 

00:34:33.567 --> 00:34:38.600
This was the subject of a second
really classic 

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.867
experiment in the twentieth
century. 

00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:43.233
The first one I talked about,
which I really love, is that 

00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:45.100
Kenyon and Phillips that proves
that 

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.533
it must be an inversion. 

00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:49.433
But there's another one that
shows that it's not possible 

00:34:49.433 --> 00:34:50.667
to have frontside attack. 

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:53.533
At least it's very, very hard. 

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:56.400
And it's not possible to have a
non-planar cation. 

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.067
At least it's very, very hard. 

00:34:59.067 --> 00:35:03.433
That was in this paper published
in 1939, 

00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:06.067
which if you click there you can
download a copy of the 

00:35:06.067 --> 00:35:08.433
paper, by Bartlett and Knox. 

00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:13.233
So this is your chemical
grandfather, P.D. Bartlett, 

00:35:13.233 --> 00:35:15.067
who was a young man at that
time. 

00:35:15.067 --> 00:35:19.600
He was 32-years-old, and Knox,
who was his graduate student, 

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.233
who was almost the same age,
because he was an African 

00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:25.967
American, one of the first
African Americans to get a 

00:35:25.967 --> 00:35:30.333
Ph.D. in chemistry. 

00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:35.300
And if you click on that
asterisk, you can download an 

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.500
account of his life, which is
fascinating. 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.567
He's the grandson of a slave,
and he has a lot of trouble. 

00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:43.967
And that's why he was old at the
time he got his Ph.D. But 

00:35:43.967 --> 00:35:46.167
you can read about it there if
you want to. 

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:51.400
At any rate, they specifically
designed and prepared this 

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.833
molecule to test the mechanistic
questions. 

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:58.033
This is rather different than
just taking things, reacting 

00:35:58.033 --> 00:36:01.200
them, messing around, observing
what happens, and 

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.733
then trying to interpret it. 

00:36:02.733 --> 00:36:06.900
They specifically designed a
molecule that would test these 

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.567
questions about whether you
could have frontside attack, 

00:36:10.567 --> 00:36:13.367
whether you could have a
nonplanar cation. 

00:36:13.367 --> 00:36:16.733
And one that wouldn't be
complicated by other problems. 

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:18.900
So they thought through very
carefully to design it. 

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.200
And then Knox had to prepare it
and study it. 

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.267
Now this is a comment about that
paper. 

00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:30.467
"In 1939 Bartlett and Knox
published the account of their 

00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:33.133
work on the bridge-head
chloride, apocamphyl 

00:36:33.133 --> 00:36:35.967
chloride." That's where X equals
Cl. 

00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:39.167
"I believed then, and I believe
now, that this was a 

00:36:39.167 --> 00:36:41.800
fantastically influential paper.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.200
For thirty years afterwards, no
one really accepted any 

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.800
mechanism unless it had been
tested out on 

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.033
a bridgehead case. 

00:36:50.033 --> 00:36:53.767
Indeed, the Bartlett-Knox paper
shaped the interests and 

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:56.467
viewpoint of many chemists about
the kind of physical 

00:36:56.467 --> 00:36:58.167
organic they wanted to do. " 

00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.467
And that's a quote from John D.
Roberts, who is an 

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:04.033
Institute Professor at Caltech,
and one of the real 

00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:07.767
leaders of organic chemistry
through the twentieth century. 

00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:09.233
And he's still living now. 

00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:13.033
He said that in 1975. 

00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:15.933
This is the structure of that
molecule 

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.600
with balls and sticks. 

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:23.800
And it became so important, this
kind of structure, that 

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.800
people who are in the field know
how to draw it quickly. 

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.700
And I'll show you how to draw
it. 

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.133
It has that stick structure. 

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:33.333
And here's how you draw it. 

00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:36.733
You first form, or I do any how,
different people draw it 

00:37:36.733 --> 00:37:37.333
different ways. 

00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:41.767
But you draw this sort of a
distorted W. And then you 

00:37:41.767 --> 00:37:44.267
start at the nearest carbon, and
draw up and 

00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:46.433
down, and to the right. 

00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:50.367
And then you draw the last bond,
and you draw it last, 

00:37:50.367 --> 00:37:52.100
because it goes behind that one.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.267
So you make it broken, so it has
a sort of a 

00:37:54.267 --> 00:37:57.467
3D aspect to it. 

00:37:57.467 --> 00:38:00.067
That's this case. 

00:38:00.067 --> 00:38:01.067
And notice what it is. 

00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:02.300
It's a boat cyclohexane. 

00:38:04.967 --> 00:38:07.800
It has a bridge across the top.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.733
So it's a bridged compound. 

00:38:09.733 --> 00:38:13.167
And formally it's called a
bicycloheptane. 

00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:16.733
It's got seven carbons, the six
of the cyclohexane plus 

00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:18.700
the bridge. 

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.933
And you give numbers in brackets
in the middle of 

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:24.967
bicyclo to say how many carbons

00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:26.533
there are in each bridge. 

00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:30.900
So there's a two carbon bridge,
between these two, and 

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.167
a one carbon bridge. 

00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:37.567
And those two positions are
called bridgeheads. 

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:40.100
So this is a bridgehead chloride
that we have in the 

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:45.233
molecule of the apocamphyl
chloride that they designed 

00:38:45.233 --> 00:38:48.000
and then prepared to study. 

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.300
Now here's a space filling model
of it, and there's where 

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.000
you would have to attack to get
in the backside of 

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.267
sigma-star. 

00:38:55.267 --> 00:38:57.733
So that's obviously out of the
question, that you 

00:38:57.733 --> 00:38:58.767
could get in there. 

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:02.100
So the molecule was designed so
you can't do backside 

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:02.800
displacement. 

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.600
The question is if you can't do
backside, can you do 

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.667
frontside displacement? 

00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.133
So the attack would have to be
frontside. 

00:39:11.133 --> 00:39:14.500
Now notice something else about
this structure. 

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.533
That if you were to flatten that
carbon, if you were to 

00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:22.500
lose the chloride without
attacking it, and generate a 

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.667
flat cation, that would require
generating really 

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:30.133
strongly-strained angles here,
and here, and here. 

00:39:30.133 --> 00:39:32.800
And it was estimated by Bartlett
and Knox that that 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.133
would cost more than 23
kilocalories per mole. 

00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:38.667
Which 3/4 of that is 16. 

00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:42.567
So it would be 10^-16 factor in
rate. 

00:39:42.567 --> 00:39:44.867
Forget that. 

00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:47.167
So they've designed the molecule
so it can't undergo 

00:39:47.167 --> 00:39:51.400
backside displacement, and it
can't give the cation either, 

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.067
lose the chloride to generate
the cation. 

00:39:55.067 --> 00:39:58.500
If you were to get a cation, it
would have to not be 

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.733
planar, otherwise it would be
slowed down by 10^16 fold. 

00:40:03.733 --> 00:40:07.833
So they set up to answer those
two questions. 

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:10.200
But there's another possible
competition. 

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.200
Remember in Kenyon and Phillips,
they couldn't use 

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.267
hydroxide, they had to use
acetate, because the reaction 

00:40:16.267 --> 00:40:19.000
would go otherwise if they used
the 

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.233
strong base, hydroxide. 

00:40:21.233 --> 00:40:25.233
So might competition from loss
of HCl to generate a double 

00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:27.500
bond be a problem here? 

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.133
Well, although there are
hydrogens on the carbon 

00:40:31.133 --> 00:40:34.433
adjacent to the carbon bearing
the chloride, there are 

00:40:34.433 --> 00:40:35.833
beta-hydrogens. 

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:38.467
But they're not in the position
you would need in 

00:40:38.467 --> 00:40:40.400
order to get elimination. 

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.000
Notice that if you had hydrogens
here, here, and 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.067
here, then you could do the
elimination. 

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:49.133
This is anti to the leaving
group, so you to do that, and 

00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:50.833
make a double bond there. 

00:40:50.833 --> 00:40:56.833
But there are not hydrogens
here, or here, or here. 

00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:59.600
So you can't do the elimination.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.600
Those are gauche, not anti to
the chloride 

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.500
that going to be leaving. 

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.200
And even if you could break off
H and Cl, this would be 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.967
the double bond you would
generate. 

00:41:11.967 --> 00:41:15.433
Now think about that double
bond. 

00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:18.333
Here's the p orbital on the
carbon that used to have the 

00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:21.567
chlorine in it. 

00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:24.500
But here's the p orbital on the
carbon that now has only 

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.733
one hydrogen. 

00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:28.800
What's wrong? 

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.633
They don't overlap. 

00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:33.333
There's horrid overlap. 

00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:37.933
So in fact, there's a rule
called Bredt's rule that 

00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:40.967
a carbon-carbon double bond
cannot originate from such a 

00:41:40.967 --> 00:41:42.533
bridgehead. 

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:45.700
Incidently, I looked up Bredt's
paper yesterday, and 

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.833
it's interesting that Bredt
himself calls it Bredt's rule. 

00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:52.967
Usually somebody else names it
in honor of the inventor, but 

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:54.400
Bredt didn't wait around. 

00:41:56.933 --> 00:41:59.800
Would competition from loss of
HCl make it hard to do? 

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.533
No. 

00:42:00.533 --> 00:42:03.567
So here's the beauty of the
design of this molecule. 

00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:06.033
It can't do backside
displacement. 

00:42:06.033 --> 00:42:09.967
If it forms a cation, it has to
be a non-planar cation, and 

00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:13.100
it can't do elimination, so how
reactive is it? 

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.700
Well here's the part of the
paper that discusses that. 

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.500
It says "all attempts to replace
the chlorine failed." 

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.900
You can't do displacement on
this bridgehead chloride. 

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.000
They refluxed it "for twenty-one
hours with 30% 

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.800
potassium hydroxide in 80%
ethanol." And they didn't get 

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.167
any reaction. 

00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:35.767
Notice they said it was a little
hard to do because 

00:42:35.767 --> 00:42:39.700
these vigorous conditions
attacked the glass, but they 

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.033
didn't attack this molecule. 

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:48.067
So that frontside attack, where
you can't come at the 

00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:51.167
backside, you have to come in
from the front, must be at 

00:42:51.167 --> 00:42:54.167
least a million times slower
than the 

00:42:54.167 --> 00:42:55.633
typical backside attacks. 

00:42:55.633 --> 00:42:59.733
So probably much, much slower
than that. 

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:03.267
Now how about the possibility of
forming the cation. 

00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:06.100
They said they refluxed it with
silver nitrate in aqueous 

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.200
ethanol solution for two days. 

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.300
What's the idea of the silver? 

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.600
Because silver can attack the
unshared pair on chlorine, and 

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.100
form a bond, and break the bond
from the R, to leave a 

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.300
cation of R. So instead of
pushing by attacking the 

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.800
backside, you pull the chloride

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.300
off leaving the cation. 

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.400
So that's a good way to generate
cations, except in 

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.833
this case it didn't work. 

00:43:37.833 --> 00:43:40.700
There was no opalescence. 

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.367
The solution remained clear. 

00:43:42.367 --> 00:43:44.067
Why opalescence? 

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:47.367
Because if you get this
reaction, the sodium chloride, 

00:43:47.367 --> 00:43:48.667
makes a precipitate. 

00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:51.433
If you get just a little bit of
it, you can see a little 

00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:52.900
bit of cloudiness there. 

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.000
But they saw none, and in fact
as you can read here, "the 

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.933
reaction of silver nitrate with
1-chloroapocamphane is 

00:43:59.933 --> 00:44:05.867
least 2 x 10^-10 at about 85
degrees." 

00:44:05.867 --> 00:44:14.400
Now the reaction in this
compound, so it's carbon that 

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.067
has two methyls and an ethyl on
it. 

00:44:19.067 --> 00:44:21.967
This one here is at least a
billion 

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:23.733
times slower than that. 

00:44:23.733 --> 00:44:26.700
And when this one was measured,
it was done 60 

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:31.200
degrees cooler, and without the
silver pulling on it. 

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.067
So it's many, many, many powers
of 10 more difficult to 

00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:39.267
form this cation when it's bent.

00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:43.867
So it's very hard to form bent
cations. 

00:44:43.867 --> 00:44:47.467
And it's very hard to do
frontside attack. 

00:44:47.467 --> 00:44:52.033
So this was a beautiful
experiment where they 

00:44:52.033 --> 00:44:53.900
specifically designed a molecule
to 

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.300
answer these questions. 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.800
And it succeeded, and it became
the model for many 

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.700
kinds of mechanistic studies
that were done over the next 

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.767
thirty years. 

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:07.467
Now there are also interesting
cases when the R 

00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:09.133
group is in a ring. 

00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:12.900
So here's no ring at all, just
two methyl groups, then three, 

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.833
four, five, and six membered
rings. 

00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:18.567
And we're going to displace the
bromide. 

00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:22.033
Now cyclopentyl bromide is
almost exactly the same rate 

00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:25.300
as isopropyl bromide, which
we're taking to be 1 for 

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.333
relative purposes. 

00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:35.300
But cyclobutyl is very much
slower, 200 times slower. 

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.667
And cyclopropyl is very, very
much slower than that. 

00:45:40.667 --> 00:45:44.833
Now any ideas about why there's
no problem with 

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:48.300
cyclopentane, but cyclobutyl and
cyclopropyl are bad. 

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.600
What do you think about when you
compare those rings? 

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.067
Chris? 

00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:57.000
STUDENT: Strain. 

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.733
PROFESSOR: Strain. 

00:45:57.733 --> 00:45:59.467
Right, exactly. 

00:45:59.467 --> 00:46:02.567
That one has 109 degree bond
angle, and so does 

00:46:02.567 --> 00:46:06.233
cyclopentane, but the others
have very small bond angles. 

00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.000
Now wait a second. 

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.567
This strain is in the starting
material. 

00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:15.200
If you destabilize the starting
material, you should 

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.233
make a reaction faster, not
slower. 

00:46:19.767 --> 00:46:23.133
So that in itself seems to be
backwards. 

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:29.433
What the heck is going on? 

00:46:29.433 --> 00:46:31.067
Let's think about the transition

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:32.133
state for the reaction. 

00:46:32.133 --> 00:46:34.567
How hard does it get from the
starting material to the 

00:46:34.567 --> 00:46:35.567
transition state? 

00:46:35.567 --> 00:46:38.167
That's what determines the rate.

00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:41.100
So the transition state looks
like this. 

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.100
And it wants-- it's sp2
hybridized to make those bonds 

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.767
to the original substituents. 

00:46:47.767 --> 00:46:51.067
So it wants to have 120 degree
bond angle. 

00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:54.367
Beforehand, it wanted to have
109 degree bond angle. 

00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:58.333
Now it wants the bond angle to
be even bigger. 

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:00.733
So if you have a 60 degree bond
angle and it wants to be 

00:47:00.733 --> 00:47:05.867
120, that's worse than having 60
when it wants to be 109. 

00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:09.700
So indeed the starting material
is strained. 

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.000
But the transition state is even
more strained. 

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.233
So you always have to compare
the starting material and the 

00:47:15.233 --> 00:47:17.567
transition state in a situation
like this. 

00:47:17.567 --> 00:47:20.933
So the increased strain in the
transition state is 

00:47:20.933 --> 00:47:22.333
what slows it down. 

00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:24.267
Now how about cyclohexane? 

00:47:24.267 --> 00:47:30.433
It has 109 degree bond angle
here, but it's slowed down. 

00:47:30.433 --> 00:47:31.800
It can't be this kind of thing.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.233
It could go to 120 no problem. 

00:47:34.233 --> 00:47:38.500
No problem with making 120
degree bond angle here. 

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.433
Can you see what the problem is
in the six member ring? 

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:46.300
Why is it slower than five? 

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.767
Remember the shape of the five
member ring? 

00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:49.800
It's almost flat. 

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.867
A little bit puckered. 

00:47:51.867 --> 00:47:57.833
But cyclohexane is the chair,
which means that chloride is 

00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:03.267
running into these two CH2
groups right here. 

00:48:03.267 --> 00:48:05.500
In cyclopentane, those other
groups would be out 

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.533
here, not up here. 

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:13.367
And you notice that it's
strained because the line 

00:48:13.367 --> 00:48:16.733
between the leaving group and
the nucleophile is bent here. 

00:48:16.733 --> 00:48:19.333
This thing is being pushed back.

00:48:19.333 --> 00:48:22.500
So there's a different kind of
strain in this case that slows 

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.900
it down by a factor of 200,
compared to that one. 

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:35.967
So we've seen the rate constant
dependence on R. Now 

00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:37.833
we're going to look at it just
really quickly on the 

00:48:37.833 --> 00:48:39.833
nucleophile. 

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:42.400
So here are a bunch of
nucleophiles, and they get 

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.600
faster, and faster, and faster.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.133
Now, is it the same with the
proton? 

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:51.233
How about the pKa's? 

00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:54.833
If we look at this, water as a

00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:56.367
leaving group[correction; as a
nucleophile],flouride, and

00:48:56.367 --> 00:49:05.300
hydroxide, you see that indeed,
as it gets to be a 

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:10.933
stronger acid, it's slow. 

00:49:10.933 --> 00:49:11.600
Is that right? 

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.933
A weak acid is fast. Is that 

00:49:14.933 --> 00:49:16.800
reasonable, or is that
backwards? 

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.500
STUDENT: It seems like it would
be backwards. 

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.133
PROFESSOR: A weak acid means it
holds 

00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:21.400
on to a proton tightly. 

00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:26.833
But it also is holding onto-- 

00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:28.967
attacking a carbon well. 

00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:31.100
So that makes sense. 

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.167
That makes a lot of sense. 

00:49:33.167 --> 00:49:36.533
So for first row elements, the
nucleophilicty attack on 

00:49:36.533 --> 00:49:40.167
sigma-star, parallels basicity
attack on H+. 

00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:42.467
Both require a higher HOMO,
which'll 

00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:43.833
make it more reactive. 

00:49:43.833 --> 00:49:45.400
So far, so good. 

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.200
Now let's look at the halides. 

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.267
Fluoride, chloride, bromide,
iodide. 

00:49:50.267 --> 00:49:56.967
Notice that as the acid get
stronger, it speeds up. 

00:49:56.967 --> 00:49:59.333
Now it's backwards. 

00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.467
The halides are going backwards.

00:50:01.467 --> 00:50:06.300
The better they are at attacking
a proton, the worse 

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.767
they are at attacking carbon. 

00:50:07.767 --> 00:50:09.667
That doesn't make sense. 

00:50:09.667 --> 00:50:13.533
And we see the same thing here
for oxygen and sulfur. 

00:50:13.533 --> 00:50:18.533
Sulfur is a stronger acid, but
it's better 

00:50:18.533 --> 00:50:20.867
at attacking carbon. 

00:50:20.867 --> 00:50:22.100
This seems nuts. 

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.433
Now this is actually tied into
the effect of solvent. 

00:50:29.433 --> 00:50:33.533
Because if you look at the
relative rates in water for 

00:50:33.533 --> 00:50:36.833
attacking methyl iodide with
these different nucleophiles, 

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:40.267
you see this which is
essentially what we see here. 

00:50:40.267 --> 00:50:43.733
This is 14 times faster, here's
10,000. 

00:50:43.733 --> 00:50:47.600
This is 160 times faster, here
it's 80 times faster. 

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.633
These are generic numbers, and
these are specific ones for a 

00:50:50.633 --> 00:50:52.833
particular case. 

00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:54.767
But look what happens if you do
it in acetone. 

00:50:57.267 --> 00:50:59.733
It turns around. 

00:50:59.733 --> 00:51:02.933
So it's what you expect in
acetone, but it's 

00:51:02.933 --> 00:51:04.567
backwards in water. 

00:51:04.567 --> 00:51:08.067
What's special about water? 

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:10.200
Why are things backwards in
water? 

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.767
What's different about water and
acetone? 

00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:13.600
STUDENT: Water is polar. 

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.633
PROFESSOR: Water forms hydrogen
bonds. 

00:51:16.633 --> 00:51:21.100
And when you form hydrogen bond
to an anion, you 

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.033
deactivate it. 

00:51:22.033 --> 00:51:24.900
You have to break the hydrogen
bond in order for it to attack 

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.867
something else. 

00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:32.133
So you can see that this is
sensible in acetone, but it's 

00:51:32.133 --> 00:51:35.900
backwards in water, because it's
harder to break hydrogen 

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.733
bonds to the smaller ions. 

00:51:38.733 --> 00:51:42.967
So as the ions get big, like
iodide, then they're not very 

00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:45.500
much hydrogen bonded, and even
though they're not so good at 

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.500
attacking protons, they're in
fact better at attacking 

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.833
carbons because you don't have
to break the water away. 

00:51:51.833 --> 00:51:54.200
OK, will continue with this
stuff next time. 

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.467
Thanks.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.800
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK.
I want to start with a

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.133
question that was asked 

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:10.433
by Ayesha after the last lecture
regarding fractional-order 

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.900
of kinetics. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.800
You remember that in the
reaction of methyllithium 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.333
there was a pre-equilibrium
between the tetramer and the 

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.667
monomer so that tetramer is
dominant, but 

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.033
the monomer is reactive. 

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:28.867
So remember what that meant was
that in this 

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.800
pre-equilibrium the rate of
association equals the rate of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.300
disassociation. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.167
So the concentration of monomer
to the fourth power is 

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.333
proportional to that of the
tetramer. 

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.467
Or if you take the fourth roots
on each side it says 

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:49.700
that the concentration of the
reactive species is one-fourth 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.900
power in the amount of material
you actually add, 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.867
which is the dominant tetramer.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:58.300
What Ayesha pointed out is this
seemed to be similar to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.367
the case of a radical-chain
initiator, which also had a 

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.800
fractional order. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Remember the idea was that the
initiator breaks to give two 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.100
radicals, then the radical
abstracts a hydrogen to give 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700
the radical, which is part of
the cyclic mechanism in the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.567
radical-chain, the propagation
steps of the 

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.300
free-radical reaction. 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.367
But ultimately the machines are
destroyed by two radicals 

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.533
getting together in the
termination process, either 

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:32.100
forming X-X or X with R or R
with R. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
So at first glance this doesn't
look very similar to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.467
the equilibrium on the top. 

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:39.333
This isn't an equilibrium at
all. 

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.500
You're not going back to the
starting material, you're not 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.467
getting back to the peroxide. 

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:50.167
So this one is an example of a
steady state instead of an 

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:51.433
equilibrium. 

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:57.200
So when the initiation is
constantly going on, the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.100
machine gets into a steady state
of how fast it's going 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.267
around and disappearing at the
same time, then you have the 

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:09.100
amount of termination equals the
amount of initiation. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.733
So you have a steady amount of
this, which is going to 

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:14.733
determine the rate of the
reaction of the machine. 

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.200
And since the termination is
proportional to the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.033
concentration of radical
squared, the radical could be 

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:25.300
in the form either of X atom or
in the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.800
form of the R radical'. 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.033
But whatever it is, when two of
them get 

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.533
together that does it. 

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:35.100
So the radical's concentration
squared, how much machine 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.233
there is squared, is
proportional to the 

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.600
initiation, to the concentration
of this. 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.900
So this isn't an equilibrium, as
it was in the top. 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.333
But really it's the same deal. 

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.167
The number of machines then is
proportional to the square 

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:54.400
root of the amount of the
initiator. 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.767
And notice that this is the
same-- association equals 

00:02:56.767 --> 00:03:00.433
disassociation implies this
relationship, termination 

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.000
equals initiation implies this
relationship. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.633
So really they are the same
thing, even though when she 

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.300
asked me the question I thought
they 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.367
were completely different. 

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:11.733
So I've been teaching this for
45 years or something like 

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.600
that, and it never occurred to
me that these fundamentally 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.000
were the same thing, the reason
you have this 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.533
fractional-order kinetics. 

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:22.667
So this was a simplification and
generalization that Ayesha 

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.600
came up with, and that's what
constitutes progress in 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.167
science is when instead of
having to memorize a zillion 

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.700
things, you find out they're all
the same and you 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.200
just know that one. 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.133
So congratulations to Ayesha,
and keep up the good work all 

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:37.633
you people. 

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.133
That's what makes it fun to
teach you. 

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:44.967
After x years of teaching this
I'm still learning. 

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:46.367
And I also ask questions. 

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:51.133
So on the 2009 exam I asked
consider this chlorination 

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.667
reaction-- the one we talked
about at 

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.200
the end of last lecture-- 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.433
and certain bond dissociation
energies, and then you're 

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.233
supposed to figure out various
things. 

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:04.700
But part G of this many-part
question was why should the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.600
bond disassociation energies of
N-Cl and R-Cl be so 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.133
different, when those of N-H and
R-H are so similar? 

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:22.000
So N-Cl is 46, N-H is 92, twice
as big. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
R-Cl and R-H are about the same
energy. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.667
Why is that? 

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:32.333
Well, the answer I expected was
based on this-

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.733
lone-pair repulsion. 

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:39.567
So here on the left we have
peroxide and ethane. 

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.867
They have the same number of
electrons. 

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.900
And on the right we have N-Cl
and methyl-Cl, the same number 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.233
of electrons on the right. 

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:55.033
Now if you look at the bond
disassociation energies, this 

00:04:55.033 --> 00:05:00.467
one is twice as strong as that
one, and this one is nearly 

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.467
twice as strong as that one. 

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:06.500
So what makes the ones on the
top so weak when really it's 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.400
the same number of electrons
involved up and down? 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.667
Well, what you notice is that on
top you have lone pairs on 

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:15.400
the atoms that are being bonded,
which 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.167
will repel one another. 

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.867
So the idea I expected was that
that 

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:21.367
would weaken the bond. 

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:22.633
Now is this plausible? 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.733
Could the electron-pair
repulsion explain the 

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.700
difference in bond
disassociation energies 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.100
between the top and bottom? 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.500
Well, we can look at how the
electrons actually are 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.100
arranged, as we calculate it by
quantum mechanics. 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.400
And, of course, what it looks
like depends on 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.133
what contour we draw. 

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:49.033
This contour at 0.002 electrons
per cubic Bohr 

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:51.633
radius is not very informative.

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:56.433
But if we go in further to
higher densities to 0.01 to 

00:05:56.433 --> 00:06:02.267
0.05 to 0.25, now we see
something different in these 

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:02.867
two things. 

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:09.067
You notice that in the bottom,
the protons that are out here, 

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.467
the proton on the carbon, as
opposed to where there is no 

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:17.400
proton on the oxygen, draws
these electrons out. 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.967
And the same thing here. 

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:23.033
The hydrogen that's pulled out
of the nitrogen nucleus and 

00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:27.700
put out here to become CH3, that
draws these electrons out 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.100
so that they don't repel one
another as much. 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.400
So that seems a plausible
explanation, although it's not 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.967
quantitative. 

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:40.300
So we would say then that the
repulsion between the 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.333
electrons, which is less in the
case where they've been 

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:48.067
drawn out might be an important
factor in 

00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:52.133
stabilizing the ones where the
electrons are drawn out. 

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:54.600
That was the answer I expected
on the exam because we had 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.200
talked about lone- pair
repulsion. 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.633
So that seems a plausible
explanation for weakening O-O 

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:06.000
versus C-C or N-Cl versus C-Cl.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.833
But that wasn't the answer I got
on a lot of the-- 

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.833
some people gave that answer,
but a lot of them appealed to 

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.733
the difference of
electronegativity, so that 

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:18.933
C-Cl has a big difference in the
electronegativity, 

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:22.200
according to the Pauling scale
of electronegativity. 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.200
So carbon has 2.55, chlorine
3.16-- 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.400
they're quite different in their
electronegativity, 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.533
whereas nitrogen at 3.04 is
rather similar to the 3.16. 

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.500
So what people had in mind then
was there'd be an 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.333
important resonance structure
for C-Cl that would be C+ 

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:45.433
Cl-, and that would be-- we
associate the existence of 

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:48.733
resonance structures with
stabilization. 

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:52.800
Now we've seen that we can
understand that thing in terms 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.533
of the energies of orbitals, the
concept that 

00:07:56.533 --> 00:07:58.600
was involved there. 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.267
We start with a bond either with
nitrogen to chlorine, 

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:05.867
which would have its electrons
there or carbon to chlorine, 

00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:08.100
which would have its electrons
down there. 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.667
And then if we're going to break
the bond, those 

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:15.067
electrons, if we're going to go
to ions, like N+ or C+ 

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:18.800
and Cl-, these electron pairs
would have to 

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.133
go onto the chlorine. 

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.100
And they have to go farther when
they're on the nitrogen. 

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.300
So that mismatch in energies
aids breaking them 

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.633
heterolytically for the carbon
case. 

00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.633
Where the carbon is mismatched,
you don't have to go up as 

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:38.900
much, so it's easier to ionize.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.700
But that's not what we're
talking about in bond 

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.300
dissociation energy. 

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.700
In bond dissociation energy
we're talking about breaking 

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.300
to two free radicals where one
goes on one atom, one electron 

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.000
goes on the other from the pair.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.933
And now, as we talked about
early last semester in terms 

00:08:56.933 --> 00:09:00.900
of bond disassociation energy or
homolysis, it's the 

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.900
carbon-chlorine bond is
stronger. 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:11.300
'So this is putting slightly
more quantitative ideas to 

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.333
bear on the idea of why you have
that 

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.000
difference in bond strength. 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.867
But the idea of
electronegativity being 

00:09:20.867 --> 00:09:23.767
associated with bond strength is
an interesting one that's 

00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:25.933
worth tracing down a little bit.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:29.200
So I'm going to talk just a
little bit today about 

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.300
electronegativity and bond
strength. 

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.067
The first use-- 

00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:35.800
I mentioned this last semester
in English-- 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.400
of the word electronegativity
was in 1837 in System of 

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.100
Mineralogy by James Dwight Dana.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.133
And we mentioned that James
Dwight Dana was a professor 

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:53.233
here at Yale in the nineteenth
century. 

00:09:53.233 --> 00:10:00.033
He lived in this house that
you've walked by, which is now 

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.167
a national historical monument.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:06.033
And he lived in the house with
his wife, Henrietta Dana. 

00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:08.433
Actually, it was Henrietta
Silliman Dana 

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:10.767
was her maiden name. 

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:13.567
And she was the daughter of
Benjamin Silliman, whose 

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:19.267
statue is just down past Nate
out there, as you see him on 

00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:20.433
the way up. 

00:10:20.433 --> 00:10:25.833
I think his snow necklace is
gone this week. 

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.133
So Dana was well married. 

00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:31.900
That's just to give you a little
local color. 

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.733
But electronegativity in the
sense we use it. 

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:38.533
What sense would Dana have been
involved in 

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:40.133
electronegativity? 

00:10:40.133 --> 00:10:45.300
In 1837 what idea was going
around where the negativity or 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.200
positivity of atoms would be
important? 

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.400
STUDENT: Dualism. 

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.167
PROFESSOR: Dualism, right. 

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:53.633
The idea of what held things
together. 

00:10:53.633 --> 00:10:55.933
He thought if you could
understand what was negative 

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:57.767
and what was positive then you
could understand 

00:10:57.767 --> 00:10:59.167
minerals in that case. 

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:02.233
But electronegativity in the
sense of organic chemistry, or 

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:05.600
inorganic chemistry for that
matter, was popularized by 

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.667
Linus Pauling, beginning with
this paper in 1933-- 

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.100
or 1932 it was published. 

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.600
So this is a key passage in that
paper. 

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.767
And remember that Pauling was
pushing this idea of 

00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:23.400
resonance-- 

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.333
that you get stabilization when
you can draw different 

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.100
resonance structures. 

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.867
So he's talking about the
additivity of the energies of 

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:33.367
normal covalent bonds. 

00:11:33.367 --> 00:11:36.633
He says, "There's empirical
evidence in support of the 

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:40.767
postulate that the energies of
normal covalent bonds are 

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:44.000
additive." Now what does he mean
by additive? 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.033
That is, that if you have atoms
A and B, you could have 

00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:54.167
AA, you could have AB, BB, and
you could have AB. 

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:57.833
And his idea is that the bond
strength in AB should be the 

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:02.500
average of what you have in AA
and what you have in BB. 

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.367
So he was a little confusing
about that, because in some 

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:10.967
papers he used this concept
using the arithmetic mean, but 

00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:13.800
in others he talked about the
geometric mean where it was 

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.533
the square root of the product
instead of half the sum. 

00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:22.700
But at any rate, the idea was
that normal covalent bonds 

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.400
should be the average of the
homonuclear bonds. 

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.367
So he uses, then, this plot
where he's measuring the 

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.667
energies of the bonds, bond
disassociation energies, in 

00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:38.700
unusual units for us, electron
volts. 

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.633
You multiply by 23 to get
kilocalories per mole. 

00:12:42.633 --> 00:12:48.033
So here are H-X bonds that are
normal, that is, calculated if 

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.133
they were normal. 

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.833
They're the average of the H-H
and the X-X for the different 

00:12:52.833 --> 00:12:55.867
halogens, as you see, fluorine,
chlorine, bromine 

00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:57.133
and iodine. 

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.700
Now incidentally, there's a
little problem here because he 

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.400
was using the wrong value for
the fluorine-fluorine bond 

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.233
energy in all of this work. 

00:13:08.233 --> 00:13:11.033
He thought it was 65
kilocalories per mole; 

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:12.800
actually it's 38. 

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.700
It's a rather weak bond because
of all these electron-pair 

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.567
repulsions that we talked about.

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:22.900
So his numbers are a little bit
skewed, but at any rate, 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.100
that was what he was doing. 

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.400
So this is theoretical. 

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.267
To get these red numbers he used
H-H and X-X and just took 

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:33.500
their average. 

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.300
Now observed values are this;
the bonds are actually 

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.433
stronger than you expect. 

00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:41.967
But they're not all stronger by
the same amount. 

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.233
And the reason is in Pauling's
theory, this resonance theory, 

00:13:48.233 --> 00:13:50.833
that you could have the polar
resonance structure, which 

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.033
makes it more stable. 

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.733
What this suggests is that
there's this difference, 

00:13:56.733 --> 00:14:00.133
delta, between what you would
expect if it were normal, the 

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:02.833
average, and what you observe,
which is what you have when 

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.600
you have this polar resonance
structure. 

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.633
And what he says here, the
greater the ionic character of 

00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:13.867
the bond the greater will be the
value of delta. 

00:14:13.867 --> 00:14:18.500
So the neat idea now is we could
use delta, which is 

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.567
based on experimental numbers,
as a way to measure how 

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:23.833
important resonance is. 

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:32.567
So you could measure resonance
stabilization by delta, if you 

00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:37.433
adopt his assumptions that
normal bonds are the average, 

00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:40.567
and now you measure these and
the difference tells you how 

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.800
important resonance
stabilization is. 

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.400
And then you try to see if
there's something you can 

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.067
correlate to predict how
important resonance 

00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:52.133
stabilization should be. 

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:55.333
So he has his rather complicated
Table 2 in the 

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:59.500
paper, which has observed bond
energies, normal bond 

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.467
energies, delta, and the square
root of delta. 

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:06.733
Now let's show how that works by
taking one 

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:08.633
particular block here. 

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:12.700
So we're comparing oxygen and
fluorine. 

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.933
So here on the table we look at
oxygen-oxygen, and its bond 

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:21.633
dissociation energy is 1.49
electron volts. 

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:26.400
Or you can look over here and
fluorine-fluorine is 2.80. 

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.200
So if the bond were normal the
oxygen-fluorine bond would be 

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200
the average of those. 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.633
Although remember, actually this
is 1.65, it's not 2.80. 

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:42.200
But put that aside for now. 

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.033
Then if you look at oxygen with
fluorine, the bond 

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:50.500
disassociation energy observed
is 2.48. 

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.367
Now we could compare that. 

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:57.800
Notice it's not the average of
1.49 and 2.80. 

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.767
It's too high. 

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:04.167
So we could calculate what the
normal would be, what the 

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.533
average is of O-O and F-F. 

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:10.033
And then we can take the
difference. 

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.433
The difference is 0.33-- 

00:16:12.433 --> 00:16:13.833
that's delta. 

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:18.933
That's how much, in his view,
the O-F bond has been 

00:16:18.933 --> 00:16:23.767
stabilized because of the
resonance structure. 

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:28.700
Now is there a way to predict
how big that delta should be? 

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.933
Well, here's the same deal with
carbon and fluorine. 

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:37.067
And notice that the delta for
carbon and fluorine is 2.20-- 

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:39.533
much bigger than between oxygen
and fluorine, 

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:41.767
which was only 0.33. 

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:44.567
Or you could look in a different
block and see what 

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:48.300
it is for carbon and oxygen,
it's 1.0. 

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.433
So we know carbon to oxygen how
much it is, we know carbon 

00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:55.533
to fluorine how much it is, and
we know oxygen to fluorine 

00:16:55.533 --> 00:16:56.533
how big it is. 

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.667
Is there some relationship among
these that we could-- 

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:02.667
knowing two of them we could
have predicted the third. 

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:08.267
Well, not really, because the
difference between C and F and 

00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:11.400
minus difference between C and O
is not the difference 

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.000
between O and F. It doesn't
work. 

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.600
You can't add up the polarity
differences that way. 

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.167
But then he tried something
else. 

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:23.133
He tried taking the square root
of delta. 

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:24.933
That's the brown numbers here. 

00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:28.333
So this is a square root of
those stabilizations. 

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:31.033
And now you see something
interesting. 

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:37.667
That the difference between C-O
and C-F is the difference 

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:42.167
between O and F, pretty close. 

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:45.433
So the square roots are about
additive. 

00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:49.667
Now I don't think he had any
good reason theoretically to 

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:51.600
say it should be the square
root. 

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.067
But he fiddled with the numbers
and he 

00:17:53.067 --> 00:17:54.333
noticed that worked. 

00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:00.267
So the question is does it work
for all the elements? 

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:05.100
If so, then from some you can
predict the others. 

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:10.667
So here he has the square roots
of delta for carbon 

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:11.733
versus other things. 

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:15.967
That is, how important is the
resonance structure, the 

00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:19.267
square root of the stabilization
of the bond. 

00:18:19.267 --> 00:18:26.067
How important is that for C-H,
for C-N, for C-O, for C-F, for 

00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:28.467
C-Cl, for C-Br? 

00:18:28.467 --> 00:18:32.000
And can we use that to establish
a scale of how 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.100
different the polarities are
among those different atoms? 

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.067
So here he has carbon, and
here's hydrogen on one side, 

00:18:42.067 --> 00:18:46.200
then bromine, chlorine and
nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.100
on the other side. 

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.533
And the distances there are
those numbers we just saw on 

00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:51.367
the previous slide. 

00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:55.667
How important after taking the
square root is that energy 

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:58.900
difference, that stabilization.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.867
So we did it with carbon. 

00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:03.200
So you get some values. 

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.867
But if those values are
fundamental, then you should 

00:19:06.867 --> 00:19:09.867
get the same scale no matter
what atom you used. 

00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:13.600
You don't have to do carbon-X,
you could do nitrogen-X or 

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.533
oxygen-X or anything else X, and
you should always get the 

00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:19.433
same scale, if this system is
going to work. 

00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:22.200
So that's these other horizontal
lines. 

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.500
Notice that in the case of
carbon the difference between 

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.267
carbon and oxygen is 1, the
difference between carbon and 

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:32.333
fluorine is 1.48, and then the
difference between oxygen and 

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.000
fluorine is 0.48. 

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.767
And experimentally, if you
measure relative to oxygen, 

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:42.033
oxygen to fluorine is 0.58, not
bad. 

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:45.800
So here are the others compared
to oxygen for the O-X 

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.233
bonds, and here they are
relative to hydrogen. 

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:53.700
And notice that as you come down
with oxygen, fluorine, 

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.000
chlorine, nitrogen, bromine,
carbon, 

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.200
they're sort of the same. 

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.200
It's the same order and they're
about the same. 

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.200
So this isn't the last word in
theory. 

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.533
But it looks like something
pretty fundamental. 

00:20:06.533 --> 00:20:09.633
And then here he used relative
to both H on one end 

00:20:09.633 --> 00:20:11.833
and F on the other. 

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:16.000
So he called these things, this
scale, electronegativity. 

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.367
And here he gives the increasing
electronegativity, 

00:20:19.367 --> 00:20:22.233
which is just those numbers, the
square root of the 

00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:26.000
stabilization of the bond from
the previous slide, and here 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.067
are the values for hydrogen,
phosphorous, iodine, sulfur, 

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:29.900
carbon and so on. 

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.967
And these were the days when
they still did hand-written 

00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:35.600
figures in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society, 

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.567
which was a long time ago. 

00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:42.467
And then below that, he looks
at-- 

00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:44.767
I couldn't figure out for a long
time what the heck this 

00:20:44.767 --> 00:20:46.400
was, but finally I figured out--
he 

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.833
doesn't say in the paper-- 

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:51.500
but it's a picture of the
periodic table, which has been 

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.967
distorted so that it shows every
atom at its proper 

00:20:54.967 --> 00:20:56.200
electronegativity. 

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.367
So here are the halogens, here
are the chalcogenides, 

00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:01.500
nitrogen, phosphorous, carbon
and so on. 

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.800
In other words, he's taken the
periodic table and he's 

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.833
distorted it like that so that
the numbers go from red to 

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:12.233
yellow, as you go from left to
right. 

00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:14.433
So that's where
electronegativity in the 

00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:16.233
current sense-- 

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:19.000
the Pauling scale of
electronegativity, that's 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
where it came from. 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.633
And notice that what it really
depends on, is what the 

00:21:24.633 --> 00:21:29.233
periodic table depends on, is
that as you go across here, you

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:32.567
have the nuclear charge is
increasing. 

00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:34.467
The screened nuclear charge-- we
talked 

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:36.000
about that last semester. 

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And as you go down, the number
of nodes in the valence shell 

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.033
is increasing. 

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:44.033
That's what gives the periodic
table its character, that's 

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:45.567
what explains
electronegativities. 

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:53.433
So the idea of this was to push
the concept of resonance. 

00:21:53.433 --> 00:21:58.133
Now is it surprising that we
find that bond strength 

00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:01.633
correlates with differences in
Pauling's electronegativities? 

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:04.600
Remember, the chi-sub-P' is
Pauling's 

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.567
electronegativity values. 

00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:08.400
Remember how we got into this
question? 

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.767
We said why are these polar
bonds like N-Cl unusually weak 

00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:17.367
compared to bonds that don't
have that difference in 

00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:18.733
electronegativity? 

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:21.400
And we said it was repulsion of
electron pairs, but some 

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.400
people said it's
electronegativity. 

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.933
Now I ask you, is it surprising
here that bond 

00:22:26.933 --> 00:22:29.267
strength correlates with
Pauling's 

00:22:29.267 --> 00:22:32.333
electronegativity scale? 

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:37.567
Has anybody have an opinion on
that after 

00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:39.567
what I have been saying? 

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.800
I've gone through this pretty
fast, so I don't expect you 

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.267
to, but I was impressed by the
question I got after last 

00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:49.567
lecture, so I thought I'd give
it a try here. 

00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:49.900
Nate? 

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.200
STUDENT: No, because you used
the bond strengths to 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.433
determine-- 

00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:56.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no. 

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.933
Because that's where the
electronegativities came from 

00:22:58.933 --> 00:23:00.933
in Pauling. 

00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:04.667
Remember, it's the square root
of the bond strength 

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:06.567
stabilization that he used to
get the 

00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:08.300
electronegativity scale. 

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.100
So it's not surprising at all
Nate, you're exactly right. 

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.100
The Pauling electronegativity
scale was defined by the 

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.067
differences in bond strengths
from the averages. 

00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:25.633
Now in the first issue of Nature
this year--this year 

00:23:25.633 --> 00:23:27.967
has been proclaimed the
International Year of 

00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:31.800
Chemistry, so you're sitting in
the right class here. 

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.900
So the first issue of Nature was
celebrating chemistry and 

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.433
they had a bunch of essays. 

00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:42.000
And one of them on pages 26 to
28 was by Philip Ball, and it 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.333
was called "Beyond The Bond" 

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:47.833
Have we moved beyond bonds now--
can we just use quantum 

00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:49.433
mechanics to talk about things?

00:23:49.433 --> 00:23:51.367
Remember, this was the question
we asked at the end 

00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:53.600
of last semester. 

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.267
If the history of chemistry
hadn't developed the way that 

00:23:57.267 --> 00:24:01.933
it did in terms of bonds, and we
just had quantum mechanics, 

00:24:01.933 --> 00:24:04.867
would anybody ever have talked
about bonds, if you could just 

00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:07.033
calculate all these numbers? 

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:12.633
And the little squib about this
article said, "More than 

00:24:12.633 --> 00:24:16.200
ever before, new techniques show
the bonds to be a 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.767
convenient fiction, albeit one
that holds the field of 

00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:26.100
chemistry together, finds Philip
Ball." 

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.500
But one passage in that I
thought was 

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.433
particularly timely. 

00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:36.167
He said, "By the 1960s, for all
Pauling's salesmanship, MO 

00:24:36.167 --> 00:24:39.567
theory was generally agreed to
be more convenient than his 

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:41.967
resonance theory for most
purposes." 

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:45.300
So when I was a student,
resonance theory was a really 

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.133
big thing and molecular orbital
theory 

00:24:47.133 --> 00:24:48.633
was just coming on. 

00:24:48.633 --> 00:24:50.133
But it's really different now. 

00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:53.267
Now molecular orbital theory is
what people mostly focus 

00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:55.667
on, and only certain communities
tend 

00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.133
to talk about resonance. 

00:24:57.133 --> 00:25:03.200
But elementary teaching tends to
lag behind 

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.133
where people are. 

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:07.800
So resonance is still a big
thing in AP courses I 

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.033
suspect, and so on. 

00:25:10.033 --> 00:25:14.000
But any rate, it's not
surprising really. 

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.900
Certainly it's not surprising as
you correlate with 

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.700
Pauling's scale, because that's
what he used to define 

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.833
bond strengths. 

00:25:19.833 --> 00:25:26.200
But the idea of polar bonds
having high bond dissociation 

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.800
energy in terms of what we
talked about first, how far 

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.933
the electrons have to go up when
you break the bond to get 

00:25:31.933 --> 00:25:37.033
two free radicals, we expect
that energy mismatch will 

00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:38.000
strengthen bonds. 

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.367
So accrued correlation of the
Pauling electronegativity 

00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:45.467
scale plotted vertically with
other measures of how tightly 

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:48.667
electrons are held, the orbital
energy. 

00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:51.400
For example, how much energy it
takes to pull an electron 

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.867
away from an atom. 

00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:58.100
Or how much energy does it take
to pull an electron away 

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.567
from a charged ion. 

00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:05.067
Both of those things are
measures of orbital energy. 

00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:07.767
And that's what's called
Mulliken's electronegativity 

00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:12.133
scale, which he published two
years later in 1934, the 

00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:14.133
average of ionization potential

00:26:14.133 --> 00:26:15.733
and electron affinity. 

00:26:15.733 --> 00:26:21.067
So this one, Mulliken was one of
the chief originators of 

00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:23.600
molecular orbital theory, which
in the middle of the 

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.300
century was in real competition.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.600
It was a little bit like radical
theory and type theory 

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.433
100 years earlier. 

00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:33.567
There was a lot of competition
between them. 

00:26:33.567 --> 00:26:37.367
But Mulliken's theory, which has
to do with orbital energy 

00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:40.167
we can understand, and we see
that it correlates more or 

00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:42.800
less well with Pauling's
electronegativity scale. 

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.767
So fine. 

00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:46.967
So electronegativity does have
something to do with it, but 

00:26:46.967 --> 00:26:49.600
electronegativity really is not
sort of 

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.833
a fundamental property. 

00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:54.433
It was measured in terms of
these bond stabilizations. 

00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:58.667
OK, that's just a little bit of
a sidelight to what we're 

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:00.100
actually talking about. 

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.300
The chemistry and physics of
alkyl halides we're going to 

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.967
talk about now. 

00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:08.567
Free-radical halogenation
introduces a functional group 

00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:09.433
into alkanes. 

00:27:09.433 --> 00:27:13.067
Normal alkanes don't have a
functional group, unusually 

00:27:13.067 --> 00:27:14.800
high HOMO or low LUMO. 

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.167
Once you've done a free-radical
reaction on 

00:27:17.167 --> 00:27:21.267
those, now you have this
unusually low LUMO, 

00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:24.733
sigma*, so you could begin doing
things with it. 

00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:27.300
So what we're going to talk
about now, having talked about 

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.500
free-radical reactions, is the
ionic chemistry involving that 

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.233
sigma*. 

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:34.600
So we're going to talk about the
alkyl halides, which now 

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.067
we know how to prepare. 

00:27:36.067 --> 00:27:39.933
So these are nucleophilic
substitution, and acidity is 

00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:41.100
much the same thing. 

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.667
We mentioned this preliminarily
last semester. 

00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:49.333
So there are non-bonded
interactions and solvation, 

00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:52.033
which is key for ionic
reactions. 

00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:54.867
And I just noticed that all the
work I did since last 

00:27:54.867 --> 00:28:00.533
night is not in here because
I've re-done that slide. 

00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:03.900
So the question is am I going to
put that in here or not? 

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.967
It would take about two
seconds-- 

00:28:05.967 --> 00:28:10.500
well, it'll take about a minute
to break here and start 

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.233
again with the most recent
version, which I can't 

00:28:14.233 --> 00:28:16.533
sacrifice all the work I did
since last night. 

00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:18.200
I stayed up late. 

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.333
So I'm going to save this. 

00:28:25.733 --> 00:28:26.967
Pardon me. 

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.233
Because by mistake this morning
I loaded the version 

00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:38.500
that was on the web. 

00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:46.400
OK, I've got that saved now,
nearly. 

00:28:53.133 --> 00:28:55.367
Oh, it's saving it over the web,
that's the problem. 

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.700
I hadn't reckoned on that one. 

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.900
Are there any questions while
we're pausing for this? 

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.733
Just incidentally, how much did
you learn about 

00:29:12.733 --> 00:29:14.300
electronegativity in high
school? 

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.100
Was this a big focus of your AP
course? 

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.233
STUDENT: Yeah. 

00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:20.100
PROFESSOR: So now you know where
it came from-- it came 

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.600
from Dana down the hill, and
then Pauling. 

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.900
There we go now. 

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:32.467
I want the other version that's
here I think. 

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:48.000
So I'm going to do that last
slide again because that's 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.200
where I noticed things were bad.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.733
So free-radical halogenation
introduces a functional group. 

00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:56.800
And we're going to now be
looking at that functional 

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.267
group, the chemical and physical
properties of alkyl 

00:29:59.267 --> 00:30:02.367
halides, which involve sigma*,
the functional 

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:04.067
group we've been able to put in.

00:30:04.067 --> 00:30:08.600
So we have SN1 reactions at
which those electrons go onto 

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.733
X in order to break the bond. 

00:30:10.733 --> 00:30:15.800
And we have those in which the
new electrons have gone into 

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.400
sigma* in order to help the X
leave, and that's the 

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.433
SN2' reaction. 

00:30:21.433 --> 00:30:26.367
And if the atom in the middle is
H instead of R, then this 

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:29.100
same thing is acidity. 

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.433
We introduced this concept last
semester, but we're going 

00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:35.533
to talk about it in more detail
in terms of reaction 

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:38.067
mechanisms now. 

00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:46.400
Now in the process, this makes
ions. 

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.100
So we have to go beyond the
molecules themselves in 

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.967
thinking about this reaction. 

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:55.733
Because non-bonded interactions
and solvation 

00:30:55.733 --> 00:30:59.200
turns out to be key for ionic
reactions. 

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.600
You can't just look at the
reacting species, you have to 

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.233
look at the surroundings, which
makes everything ever so 

00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:07.000
much more complicated. 

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.967
Now this Henri Victor Regnault,
who lived, as you 

00:31:10.967 --> 00:31:12.900
see, in the middle of nineteenth
century. 

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.067
And you know the first letter of
his last name because it 

00:31:17.067 --> 00:31:20.667
said that that's where they R
comes from, it stands for 

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:24.033
Regnault because he did a lot of
thermodynamic stuff. 

00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:26.933
So PV equals nRT is this man. 

00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:29.867
Now in 1850 he wrote a book, The
First Elements of 

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:32.933
Chemistry, and there's one
passage about chemical 

00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.567
affinity here that I think is
worth looking at. 

00:31:35.567 --> 00:31:38.700
He says, "For chemical affinity
to act freely, 

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.600
substances must be dispersed." 

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.133
Now this was, of course, writing
in 1850 this was 

00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:45.800
before bonds or anything. 

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.667
But they knew you don't you just
mix solids together; you 

00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:49.833
have to disperse them. 

00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:52.133
And you can't just grind them. 

00:31:52.133 --> 00:31:54.967
"Since dispersion by mechanical
pulverization is 

00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:58.833
incomplete," the molecules have
to touch molecules, not 

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.767
just particles of stuff touch
particles. 

00:32:01.767 --> 00:32:04.933
"They must be taken into the
liquid or gaseous state. 

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:09.433
Previous chemists expressed this
fact by saying, 'Corpera 

00:32:09.433 --> 00:32:14.600
non agunt, nisi soluta.'"
Substances do not react unless 

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.167
they're dissolved. 

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:20.200
So this dissolution, the fact of
what's around the things is 

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.700
what's going to be important in
understanding reactions. 

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.967
So the theory of organic
chemistry became manageable in 

00:32:26.967 --> 00:32:30.167
the first place when people
started studying 

00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:31.900
gases, as you remember. 

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.033
Because it's often possible to
focus on the simple unit with 

00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:38.833
strong interactions, that's
molecules are the individual 

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:42.033
units, and bonds within them are
the strong interactions 

00:32:42.033 --> 00:32:45.300
with well-defined geometries and
energies, as we discussed 

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.600
last semester. 

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.833
And you neglect the much more
numerous and complex 

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:54.567
intermolecular interactions with
the solvent. 

00:32:54.567 --> 00:32:57.167
But actually we're going to have
to consider those, 

00:32:57.167 --> 00:32:59.000
because we're interested not
just in the gas 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.567
phase but in solution. 

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:03.200
So it was essential to go into
the gas phase in order to get 

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.467
a toe-hold on understanding
chemistry in the first place. 

00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:09.000
But if you want to understand
real practical chemistry you 

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.967
have to understand solutions. 

00:33:10.967 --> 00:33:14.800
So these weak intermolecular
interactions give organic 

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.133
materials many of their most
valuable properties. 

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:21.567
Most of the properties of what's
important in your 

00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:24.800
bodies are not things that
involve making and breaking 

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.900
bonds, but changing non-bonded
interactions between things. 

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.600
And that's what we're going to
be looking at for a 

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.833
little while now. 

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:36.100
So non-bonded classical
energies. 

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.733
Now suppose you have just
Coulomb's law, charge-charge 

00:33:41.733 --> 00:33:42.267
interaction-- 

00:33:42.267 --> 00:33:44.467
that's where we started last
semester. 

00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:47.533
That's, as you know, the only
true source of chemical 

00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:49.333
potential energy. 

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:54.100
There's gravity and physics of
magnetism, but those are tiny. 

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.300
They're nothing compared to
Coulomb's law. 

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.867
There's the strong force-- 

00:33:57.867 --> 00:34:00.200
that's for physicists, that's
way above what we 

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.633
deal with in chemistry. 

00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:04.500
The Coulomb's law is where we
live. 

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.900
And it's proportional to 1 over
R as we know. 

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:13.133
And the constant for the
proportionality is -300, 332 

00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:17.533
kilocalories per mole when you
use angstrom units. 

00:34:17.533 --> 00:34:21.233
So this provides a very long
range attraction. 

00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:26.500
Even when you're 3Å' apart, the
energy is still 100 

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.600
kilocalories per mole. 

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.900
Actually, now where should we
start with zero? 

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.933
We could start with zero when
they're infinitely far away, 

00:34:34.933 --> 00:34:37.033
and then we use Coulomb's law to
get how 

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:38.333
the energy goes down. 

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:40.367
Or if we're thinking of breaking
the bond we could 

00:34:40.367 --> 00:34:45.967
start at the bond distance, or
the distance between two ions, 

00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:47.567
and see how much it takes to
pull them 

00:34:47.567 --> 00:34:49.967
apart a certain distance. 

00:34:49.967 --> 00:34:53.767
So a bond is 1.5, let's take
bigger. 

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:56.600
Let's suppose they're 2 Å'
apart. 

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.733
That means they're at 332 over
2. 

00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:05.200
The energy is -165. 

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.933
If we go to 3 Å' then it's -100.

00:35:08.933 --> 00:35:12.433
So we've gone up in energy by
about 100 kilocalories per 

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:15.500
mole in going from 2 to 3 Å'.
And we have a 

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.700
lot further to go on the way
out. 

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.667
This is very different from
covalent bonds where when you 

00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:23.600
get to 3 Å' that's the end of
the line. 

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.133
So covalent bonds are typically
100 kilocalories per 

00:35:27.133 --> 00:35:29.733
mole, but you get there very
quickly. 

00:35:29.733 --> 00:35:31.000
So they're very stiff. 

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.367
As you break the bond, you go up
in energy really quickly. 

00:35:37.367 --> 00:35:40.033
Coulomb doesn't go up as
rapidly, but it goes 

00:35:40.033 --> 00:35:41.433
up very, very far. 

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:42.967
So it's long range. 

00:35:42.967 --> 00:35:46.300
And that's why solvents are so
important, because another 

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.300
molecule can be rather far away
and still influence ions 

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.667
where it wouldn't influence
free-radicals. 

00:35:56.533 --> 00:36:02.000
But this is attenuated by a
solvent. 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.500
If you have a dielectric
constant, as it's called, in 

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:10.300
the solvent, that reduces the
magnitude of the Coulombic 

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.467
energy or the Coulombic force. 

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:17.800
Now how big are these values of
epsilon? 

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.400
Here are some values taken from
the Jones book. 

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.300
Notice that hexane is a factor
of 2. 

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.067
So that'll take that constant
from 300 down to 150-- 

00:36:29.067 --> 00:36:30.800
still quite big. 

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.133
But if you go to something like
water at 78, 

00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:37.067
that cuts it way down. 

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:44.100
This into this is something like
4. 

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.100
So it's only 4 kilocalories per
mole rather than 332 

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.933
kilocalories per mole, if your
operating in water, with water 

00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:54.933
all around the ions. 

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:58.167
So that's makes an enormous
difference how these ions are 

00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.433
going to interact, what solvent
you're in. 

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:02.433
It makes quite a difference what
solvent. 

00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:05.200
And notice down to acetone, the
solvents might be 

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.700
considered polar-- 

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.300
that is, they have pretty big
dielectric constants. 

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.633
So they really attenuate the
energy of 

00:37:11.633 --> 00:37:13.933
interaction between the ions. 

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:17.833
But chloroform, ether, and
hexane are not very polar, 

00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:20.767
they don't cut it down very
much. 

00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:24.600
Now this has to do with things
like the solubility or the 

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.000
melting point of salts like
sodium chloride, or 

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.900
tetramethylammonium iodide. 

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.967
Because notice that these ions
are rather small, so the 

00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:38.933
charges are close together. 

00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:40.933
But these ions are big, so
they're 

00:37:40.933 --> 00:37:42.833
substantially further apart. 

00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:45.167
And that's going to make an
enormous difference when 

00:37:45.167 --> 00:37:47.933
you're starting to pull them
apart. 

00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:52.333
If you go to twice the distance
here, you really cut 

00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:53.833
this way down. 

00:37:53.833 --> 00:38:01.200
So sodium fluoride has a melting
point of something 

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.000
like 801 C, 

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.100
but cesium iodide, the same
charges with bigger ions, is 

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.967
200 degrees lower in its melting
point. 

00:38:11.967 --> 00:38:14.267
And the solubilities reflect the
same thing. 

00:38:14.267 --> 00:38:17.667
It's easier to get the solids
apart if you're starting with 

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:20.267
bigger ions. 

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:22.933
So the big interaction is
charge-charge, but there are 

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:25.100
others that are important, too.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.300
Charge with dipole, so if you
have a molecule that's not 

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.200
charged but has a dissymmetry in
the charge that's within 

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.467
it, so it has a plus and a minus
end, then those can 

00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:37.000
interact, and that's
proportional to 1 over R 

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.600
squared, so it dies away more
rapidly. 

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.967
And if the dipole can orient so
that you have to average 

00:38:44.967 --> 00:38:47.333
over different ways it could be
oriented, it would be 

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:50.167
oriented more likely in the
favorable than in the 

00:38:50.167 --> 00:38:54.000
unfavorable way, but that
depends on the temperature. 

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.367
And if you have that situation
it turns out to be R to the 

00:38:57.367 --> 00:39:01.533
minus fourth over temperature,
because of how much is favored 

00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:03.800
one way or the other. 

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.100
Then if you go to a charge with
something that's 

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.100
non-polar, but could become
polar if it's put in the field 

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.800
of another charge, so you push
the nucleus one way, the 

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.400
electrons the other way. 

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.600
And now you get a charge
interacting 

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.567
with an induced dipole. 

00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:26.500
That depends on R to the minus
3-- 

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.100
1 over R cubed. 

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.633
Then you could have two dipoles

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:30.833
interacting with one another-- 

00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.800
that's also 1 over R cubed. 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.500
Or you could have two induced
things that are acting with 

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.033
one another. 

00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:38.933
Have you ever seen that before?

00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:42.600
How the electrons are
distributed in this one? 

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.633
When they're over here-- the
ones here tend to be over 

00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:47.233
there, and when these are here,
these are here. 

00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:49.567
Where did we encounter that
before? 

00:39:49.567 --> 00:39:51.133
STUDENT: Correlation. 

00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:54.567
PROFESSOR: Correlation energies,
right. 

00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:57.300
So that turns out to be R to the
[minus] 

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.267
sixth power. 

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:02.100
So notice that these others,
other than the Coulomb, they 

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.400
fall off very, very rapidly. 

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.400
And they start very weak. 

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.700
So you might think you could
neglect them, but there could 

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.900
be a lot of them. 

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.300
That's the problem when there
are many 

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.033
solvent molecules around. 

00:40:19.033 --> 00:40:21.933
Now let's look at some trends in
the halides. 

00:40:21.933 --> 00:40:25.600
And whatever textbook you have
you'll find this-- 

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.500
When we talk about different
functional groups we're 

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.900
talking about the alkyl halides
now. 

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.533
Typically, chapters in all the
books you look at will start 

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:34.533
with something about the
physical properties of those 

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:38.200
compounds and then go on to
their chemical properties. 

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.667
So this is a little bit about
physical 

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:41.633
properties of the halides. 

00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:46.567
So here we look at the van der
Walls radius of the halogen, 

00:40:46.567 --> 00:40:50.567
X. And here we look at the bond
distance 

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:52.800
between X and carbon. 

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.833
And you notice they're almost
exactly the same. 

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:59.400
And we learn something from
that, which is that non-bonded 

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.067
distances are something like
twice bonded distances. 

00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:09.233
Because the radius of an atom is
about the same as the 

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:11.400
distance from the nucleus of the
atom to the 

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.633
nucleus of the carbon. 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.900
So that means that the covalent
radius is about half 

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.700
of the van der Waals radius. 

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.300
Now here's a property, the
dipole moment. 

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.367
How polar is the molecule? 

00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:35.900
The dipole moment shown here,
what do you notice about that 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.800
as you go fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, iodine? 

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.800
What's the first thing you
notice about the trend? 

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.767
STUDENT: It doesn't work for H.

00:41:45.767 --> 00:41:46.067
PROFESSOR: Derek? 

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:48.300
STUDENT: There's nothing with H?

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.667
PROFESSOR: Well, I didn't put
it. 

00:41:49.667 --> 00:41:53.700
If you have H, it turns out
there is no dipole moment 

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.133
because it's with methyl. 

00:41:55.133 --> 00:41:59.633
So H-CH3 is a symmetrical
molecule, and the center of 

00:41:59.633 --> 00:42:04.400
the electrons is the same as the
center of the nuclei. 

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.200
But the red is a trend as you
go-- well, forget hydrogen 

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.300
because it's not really a
halogen. 

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.833
But here's the radius, the bond
distance. 

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:19.600
What's special about this one,
about the orange one? 

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:19.967
Lauren? 

00:42:19.967 --> 00:42:21.100
STUDENT: It goes the opposite
way. 

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:21.800
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.500
STUDENT: It goes the opposite
way. 

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:22.700
It goes down. 

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.267
PROFESSOR: It goes up and down,
it's not monotonic. 

00:42:25.267 --> 00:42:28.933
What do you learn when you see
trends that are not monotonic?

00:42:30.167 --> 00:42:31.067
Matt? 

00:42:31.067 --> 00:42:32.567
STUDENT: It's dependent on two
factors. 

00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:34.700
PROFESSOR: There must be two
things going on. 

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.867
But what's the other thing? 

00:42:36.867 --> 00:42:40.800
We're interested in how much
charge is separated. 

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.300
Here we have CH3 and a halogen.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.967
So the dipole moment is how big
the charges are and how 

00:42:50.967 --> 00:42:53.833
much they're separated. 

00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:56.400
Now we already see here how much
they're separated, that 

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.167
is, what the distance is. 

00:42:58.167 --> 00:43:00.900
But how big is the charge? 

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.700
So if we look here-- 

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.800
this is incidentally measured in
debye units, which is 4.8 

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.300
times the charge times the
separation. 

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.033
Now we know the separation and
we notice 

00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:17.167
that it's not monotonic. 

00:43:17.167 --> 00:43:19.700
And here's the charge, how many
electrons have been 

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.433
transferred. 

00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:22.667
And that's quite monotonic. 

00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:29.300
But what we've seen here is that
the dipole moment is the 

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.000
product of two properties-- 

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
how much charge and how much
separated. 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.967
But they're opposing trends. 

00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:39.467
As one goes up the other goes
down. 

00:43:39.467 --> 00:43:43.467
And although they're both
monotonic, one is non-linear, 

00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:45.167
more non-linear than the other.

00:43:45.167 --> 00:43:48.067
So they don't exactly cancel one
another in going up and 

00:43:48.067 --> 00:43:52.400
down and you get weird behavior
when you have 

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.767
conflicting non-linear trends. 

00:43:54.767 --> 00:43:58.000
So there were two things going
on to give the dipole moment. 

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.767
Now you can see a similar kind
of thing in another measure of 

00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:05.700
the size of atoms, which is
so-called A-value. 

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.767
That's how much is axial
compared to equatorial in 

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:11.233
cyclohexane. 

00:44:11.233 --> 00:44:14.933
Axial is more crowded than
equatorial is-- we talked 

00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:16.867
about this last semester. 

00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:21.167
So if we know what the energy
difference is between axial 

00:44:21.167 --> 00:44:23.500
and equatorial, we have some
measure of how 

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.467
big that group is. 

00:44:26.467 --> 00:44:30.100
So it's E axial minus energy
equatorial in kilocalories per 

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.667
mole, so that measures
substituent size. 

00:44:32.667 --> 00:44:36.467
Now here are the values for the
halogens, and hydrogen 

00:44:36.467 --> 00:44:39.300
incidentally, which is defined
as zero because you're 

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.100
comparing hydrogen with
hydrogen. 

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.300
So here it is. 

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.700
And again, you see it's not
monotonic-- 

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.867
it goes up and down. 

00:44:46.867 --> 00:44:48.967
So there must be two things
involved. 

00:44:48.967 --> 00:44:50.333
What are the two things? 

00:44:50.333 --> 00:44:54.000
One of the things is how big the
van der Walls radius of 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.833
the atom is, which clearly gets
bigger as you go 

00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.000
fluorine, chlorine, bromine,
iodine. 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.200
But why does the effect on axial
versus 

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.700
equatorial go up and down. 

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.200
Why doesn't it just go up? 

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.000
STUDENT: The bond distance
between the carbon and the 

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.867
substituent. 

00:45:08.867 --> 00:45:10.667
PROFESSOR: Because the bond gets
longer as 

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:13.633
the atom gets bigger. 

00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:15.733
So it's not monotonic, that
suggests there's a 

00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:16.733
competition. 

00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:18.000
So here's fluorine-- 

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.733
that's what's shown here. 

00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:22.000
And now watch this model as I
change 

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.767
from fluorine to iodine. 

00:45:24.767 --> 00:45:26.500
What happened? 

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.967
The atom gets bigger, not shown
to scale, but the bond 

00:45:29.967 --> 00:45:32.400
gets longer. 

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.300
So you have a larger van der
Waals radius, but it stands 

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.300
off further, so it's not so
dramatic, the difference. 

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.667
Now compare that if the group
there is CH3. 

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:50.633
Because CH3 has this effective
van der Waals radius. 

00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:54.033
So that's how I decided where to
put it on this scale. 

00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:56.400
It's got the right van der Waals
radius. 

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.300
But the bond distance for
carbon-carbon is much shorter 

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.900
than it is for bromine and
iodine or chlorine for that-- 

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.067
or it's about the same as
fluorine or 

00:46:06.067 --> 00:46:07.833
a little bit bigger. 

00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:10.667
And now when we put these two
things together in order to 

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:11.933
get the A-value-- 

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.733
we got this big group and it's
come in some, 

00:46:16.733 --> 00:46:18.867
compared to the halogens. 

00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:23.067
Now you see there's a really
wild outlier in this thing 

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:26.800
because you now have a big
group, the 

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.000
CH3, and it's short. 

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.833
So even though the radius of
methyl is between bromine and 

00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:40.533
iodine, it's effect on this is
much bigger 

00:46:40.533 --> 00:46:43.800
because it sits in closer. 

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.233
Now the boiling points of the
alkyl halides. 

00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:48.233
Here's a table-- 

00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:50.467
we could have taken it from any
book, this particular one 

00:46:50.467 --> 00:46:52.233
is from the Jones text-- 

00:46:52.233 --> 00:46:56.800
that shows different alkyl
groups and the hydrogen, 

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.533
fluorine, chlorine, bromine,
iodine, what 

00:46:58.533 --> 00:47:00.267
are the boiling points? 

00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:02.233
Now let's just see if we can
understand this. 

00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:05.400
I'm going to go just a little
bit further because we started 

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.600
late with people getting here
late, and we had that little 

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.767
break in the class. 

00:47:10.767 --> 00:47:13.400
So let's look at the boiling
point. 

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:20.200
So methane, methyl with
hydrogen, is very low boiling, 

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.333
and then it gets higher and
higher and higher. 

00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:26.233
That is, the liquid tends to
hold together more, not to go 

00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:28.033
into the gas phase-- the
molecules are 

00:47:28.033 --> 00:47:29.967
holding together more. 

00:47:29.967 --> 00:47:32.033
Now the question is why. 

00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:35.233
Why when we replace hydrogen by
fluorine, by chlorine, by 

00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:40.200
bromine, by iodine does the
boiling point go up? 

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.367
What causes the molecules to
hold together? 

00:47:43.367 --> 00:47:45.633
STUDENT: Intermolecular forces.

00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:48.467
PROFESSOR: It's not covalent
bonding. 

00:47:48.467 --> 00:47:52.600
We're talking about non-bonded
interactions now. 

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.833
What could make them hold
together? 

00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:57.667
We know the fundamental forces--

00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:00.400
it's Coulomb's law as colored by
dipoles 

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.233
and things like that. 

00:48:03.233 --> 00:48:04.200
STUDENT: Hydrogen bond? 

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.033
PROFESSOR: Taka, pardon me? 

00:48:05.033 --> 00:48:06.400
STUDENT: Hydrogen bond? 

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.067
PROFESSOR: Hydrogen bond is an
idea. 

00:48:08.067 --> 00:48:10.333
Now you're not going to get
hydrogen bonds when you don't 

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:12.033
have hydrogen. 

00:48:12.033 --> 00:48:14.533
So the halogens that's not going
to work for. 

00:48:14.533 --> 00:48:15.767
And the next thing we're going
to talk 

00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:17.333
about is hydrogen bonds-- 

00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:19.633
that'll come in the next class
now. 

00:48:19.633 --> 00:48:21.300
Any other ideas of what holds
them together? 

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.700
Nate? 

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.467
STUDENT: Polar interactions and
dispersion forces? 

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:26.733
PROFESSOR: Ah, you can have
polar interactions. 

00:48:26.733 --> 00:48:29.300
So you could have dipoles
interacting, even though there 

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.967
are no charges. 

00:48:30.967 --> 00:48:33.700
So let's look at the dipole
moment, which was on that 

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.967
previous table. 

00:48:34.967 --> 00:48:39.600
And you see that methane has
zero, but fluorine has 1.85. 

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.733
So that's going to allow the
molecules to hold together. 

00:48:43.733 --> 00:48:45.633
So raise the boiling point
because you could have them 

00:48:45.633 --> 00:48:48.333
lined up this way. 

00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:50.500
But it's not just polarity. 

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.500
Because if we go across here,
the polarity went up, but then 

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.433
it goes down again. 

00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:58.600
But the boiling point keeps
going up. 

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.367
So there must be something else
other than these dipoles 

00:49:01.367 --> 00:49:03.167
holding together. 

00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:07.600
And that other thing is
polarizabilty. 

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.767
How easy it is to shift the
electrons in the molecule, and 

00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:13.267
how many electrons there are to
shift. 

00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:16.033
So you see if you look at
fluorine, chlorine, bromine 

00:49:16.033 --> 00:49:22.200
and iodine atoms, fluorine atom
is very non-polarizable. 

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.233
When you bring a charge or a
dipole near it, it doesn't 

00:49:26.233 --> 00:49:27.633
distort very much. 

00:49:27.633 --> 00:49:30.800
But chlorine distorts more,
bromine, and iodine the most 

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.467
because it has the most
electrons, 

00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:35.867
the most weakly held. 

00:49:35.867 --> 00:49:40.400
And CH4 is not polar, and also
it's not very polarizable. 

00:49:43.633 --> 00:49:47.333
The hydrocarbon is not very
polarizable given that it's 

00:49:47.333 --> 00:49:49.400
five atoms and these are just
one atom. 

00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:56.300
Next time we'll start at this
point and go in and to try to 

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.233
understand the boiling point of
the alkanes without the 

00:50:00.233 --> 00:50:01.633
halogen on them. 

00:50:01.633 --> 00:50:07.067
Thanks for your patience with
changing horses in midstream.

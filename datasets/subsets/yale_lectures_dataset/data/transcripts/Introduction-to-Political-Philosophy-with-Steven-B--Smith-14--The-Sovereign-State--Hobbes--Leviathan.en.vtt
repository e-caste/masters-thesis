00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.350
Professor Steven Smith:
Okay, good morning.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.917
I'm going to show another movie
today but not until a little bit

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:11.680
later in the class.
We'll get it.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.320
We'll get there.
Don't worry!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.830
It doesn't fit until the last
part of the class.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.140
But today, I want to talk about
sovereignty.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.453
There are two great concepts
that come out of Hobbes that you

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:31.786
have to remember.
One is the state of nature and

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:36.147
the other is sovereignty.
I spoke a bit about the first

00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:41.668
one yesterday or Monday rather.
Today, I want to talk about

00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:47.133
Hobbes' theory of the sovereign
state, the creation of the

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.759
sovereign.
Hobbes refers to the sovereign

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.328
as a mortal god,
as his answer to the problems

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:58.226
of the state of nature,
the state, the condition of

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:00.402
life being solitary,
poor, nasty,

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:03.816
brutish and short.
And it is only the creation of

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:07.127
the sovereign for Hobbes,
endowed or possessed with

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:10.444
absolute power,
that is sufficient to put an

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:14.010
end to the condition of
perpetual uncertainty,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.769
anxiety and unrest that is the
case of the natural condition.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.923
Let me talk for a while about
some of the formal features of

00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:31.290
Hobbes' sovereign power,
of the Hobbesian state.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.036
In the first place,
what I want to impress upon you

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:41.636
is that the sovereign is for
Hobbes less a person than it is

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:46.028
or he is an office.
The sovereign is described by

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:50.674
Hobbes as an artificial person
by which he means the sovereign

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:55.167
is the creation of the contract
or the covenant that brought

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:59.782
this office into being.
The sovereign does not exist by

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:02.985
nature but rather,
Hobbes tells us again,

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:07.150
the sovereignty is the product
of art or science.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.679
It is the product,
the creation of the people or

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.209
of what we might call,
in Jeffersonian language,

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.189
it is the product of the
consent of the governed.

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.780
The sovereign and,
again, this is crucial,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.196
is for Hobbes,
the representative of the

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.256
people.
He is the sovereign

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:30.701
representative.
It is the people who endow the

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:36.080
sovereign with the authority to
represent them on their behalf.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.594
And, in that respect,
Hobbes' sovereign has many of

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:46.101
the features or characteristics
that we come to associate with

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:51.789
what we call modern executive
power or executive authority.

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.342
When Louis XIV of France
famously said L'état c'est

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.112
moi.
"I am the state," he was

00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:02.073
expressing a peculiarly
pre-modern in that way

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:05.413
conception of the state;
that is to say,

00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:09.330
he regarded the state as in
some ways his personal property.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.000
"I am the state.
The state am I."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.770
But this is very different from
Hobbes' sovereign.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.490
The state for Hobbes is not the
possession of the sovereign.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.169
Rather, the sovereign does not
own the state.

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:30.007
He is appointed or authorized
to secure for the people the,

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.831
in many ways,
limited ends of peace and

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:37.623
security.
He has much the same function

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:42.505
and to some degree much of the
same personality as what we

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:47.219
would call a modern day CEO,
that is to say there is a kind

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.789
of anonymity and impersonality
about the sovereign.

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:55.932
I mean, unless you're in the
Yale entrepreneurial society who

00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:59.190
can name the CEOs of many
companies?

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.789
And the answer is you probably
can't.

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:05.196
They are for the most part
relatively anonymous individuals

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:08.452
unless, you know,
they get into trouble like Ken

00:04:08.452 --> 00:04:11.896
Lay or someone like that or do
something amazing like Bill

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:14.182
Gates.
For the most part,

00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:19.893
they are rather impersonal and
anonymous and that is in many

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:24.540
ways the characteristic of
Hobbes' sovereign.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.222
Hobbes' theory of the
sovereign, interestingly,

00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:35.839
contains within itself elements
of both secular absolutism and,

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.267
in some ways,
modern liberalism and it is the

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:43.552
tension between these two that I
want to bring out in my

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:46.908
discussion here.
The power of the sovereign,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:50.040
Hobbes continually insists,
must be unlimited.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.252
Yet, at the same time,
he tells us that the sovereign

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:58.545
is the creation of the people
whom he represents or it

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:02.508
represents.
Although Hobbes is widely taken

00:05:02.508 --> 00:05:07.740
to be a defender of monarchical
absolutism, you will note,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.685
in your readings,
that he displays a kind of

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:17.374
studied neutrality over actually
what form the sovereign should

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:20.782
take.
He only insists that sovereign

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:25.602
power remain absolute and
undivided whether it belongs to

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.959
a single person,
a few, or the many.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:33.046
And among the powers that the
sovereign, he insists,

00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:35.610
must control are,
for example,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.818
laws concerning property,
the right of declaring war and

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:44.889
peace, what we would call
foreign policy,

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.309
rules of justice concerning
life and death,

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.240
which is to say criminal law,
and,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.761
of course, the right to
determine what books and ideas

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:59.430
are permissible,
that is to say the right of

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.082
censorship.
In a sense, the core of Hobbes'

00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:07.368
theory of sovereignty can be
boiled down to the statement

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:12.420
that the sovereign and only the
sovereign is the source of law.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.930
The law is what the sovereign
says it is.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.589
Does that sound in any way
familiar from what we have read

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.360
this term?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.890
Anyone?
Sound familiar?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.648
Thrasymachus?
Do you remember that name,

00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:39.600
Book I of the Republic?
Justice is what the stronger

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.687
say it is.
Hobbes tells us that the law is

00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:48.676
what the sovereign commands.
This is sometimes known as the

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:53.308
doctrine of legal positivism,
which is to say that law is the

00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:58.060
command of the sovereign,
a sort of command theory of law.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.218
And, again, that seems to point
back to Thrasymachus' point of

00:07:02.218 --> 00:07:05.490
view in the first book of the
Republic.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.830
There is for Hobbes,
as for Thrasymachus,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.590
no higher court of appeal than
the will or the word of the

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.710
sovereign,
no transcendent law,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.001
no divine law,
no source of authority outside

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:25.634
sovereign command.
And sovereign is appointed for

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:30.716
Hobbes to be much like an umpire
in a baseball or a football

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.990
game, to set the rules of the
game.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.790
But the Hobbesian sovereign,
unlike umpires,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:43.182
are not just the enforcers of
the rules or the interpreters of

00:07:43.182 --> 00:07:46.354
the rules,
the sovereign is also the

00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:49.759
creator, the shaper and maker of
the rules.

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:54.280
And Hobbes draws from this the
startling conclusion,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.066
in many ways the infamous
conclusion that the sovereign

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:02.899
can never act unjustly.
The sovereign can never act

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.775
unjustly, why?
Because the sovereign is the

00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:10.224
source of law and the sovereign
is the source of the rules of

00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:13.050
justice.
Therefore, Hobbes concludes,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.343
he can never act unjustly.
And he supports this example by

00:08:17.343 --> 00:08:20.684
a deeply perverse and amusing,
I have to say,

00:08:20.684 --> 00:08:24.860
reading from a biblical story,
do you remember this?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.889
He refers to the story of David
and Uriah.

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:32.701
Everybody will remember that
story from Sunday school or from

00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:36.489
Hebrew school or whatever.
Does anyone remember that David

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:40.840
was the king at that time?
He was the king of Israel and

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.980
he coveted Uriah's wife
Bathsheba.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.629
He wanted to sleep with
Bathsheba, so what did he do?

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:53.730
He had Uriah killed so he could
sleep with her.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.359
And Hobbes reasons from this
story that while David's action

00:08:59.359 --> 00:09:04.797
may have sinned against God,
he did no injustice to Uriah,

00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:08.015
imagine that.
I think Uriah might have had a

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.929
different point of view about
this.

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:12.980
He did no injustice to Uriah
because, as the lawful

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.723
sovereign, he could do any,
not just anything he liked but

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:22.580
whatever he did was set by the
rules of the law.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.093
And when Hobbes tells that
story, which he mentions a

00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:31.111
couple of times in the book,
one can only imagine he must

00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:37.950
have had a kind of wry grin on
his face when he wrote that out.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.460
In fact, next semester I'm
teaching an entire course

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.659
devoted to Hobbes' critique of
religion in which this will,

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:47.350
among other things,
figure prominently.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.361
But Hobbes' teaching about law
is, in some ways,

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.789
less Draconian than it might
first appear.

00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:01.110
He makes clear that law is what
the sovereign says it is.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.040
There can be no such thing as
an unjust law,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.107
he infers, again,
because the sovereign is the

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.820
source of all justice.
But he does distinguish,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.134
he tells us,
between a just law and a good

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:16.321
law.
All laws are by definition

00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.316
just, he tells us,
but it doesn't follow that all

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:22.929
laws are by definition good.
"A good law," he says in

00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:26.850
chapter 30, "is that which is
needful for the good of the

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.786
people."
A good law is needful for the

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:32.563
good of the people.
But then one asks,

00:10:32.563 --> 00:10:36.697
what are the criteria by which
we determine the good of the

00:10:36.697 --> 00:10:38.809
people?
How is this determined?

00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:44.461
And Hobbes makes clear that the
sovereign is not invested with

00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.650
the authority to exercise a kind
of absolute control over

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.282
everything that people do.
The purpose of law,

00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:58.572
Hobbes tell us,
is not so much to control but

00:10:58.572 --> 00:11:02.301
to facilitate.
Consider just the following

00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:05.139
passage from chapter 30,
section 21.

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:07.734
Hobbes writes:
"For the use of laws,

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:10.700
which are but rules
authorized," he says,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.000
"is not to bind the people from
all voluntary actions.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.932
It is not to bind them from
voluntary actions but to direct

00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:23.136
and keep them in such motion as
not to hurt themselves by their

00:11:23.136 --> 00:11:27.583
own impetuous desires,
rashness or indiscretion as

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:33.048
hedges are set not to stop
travelers but to keep them on

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:36.617
their way."
This is the force or purpose of

00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:38.865
law to set rules,
to keep people,

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.304
as he puts it,
on their way,

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:47.141
a law that is intended simply
to constrain and control for its

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:49.204
own sake,
Hobbes says,

00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:53.535
cannot be a good law.
The purpose of a good law is to

00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:56.789
facilitate human agency in some
ways.

00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:59.255
And I think,
again, that too is central to

00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:04.358
Hobbes' theory of the sovereign.
Its purpose is to facilitate,

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:08.049
not simply to control and
inhibit.

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:13.067
But the power to control or the
power of law for Hobbes also

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:17.999
very much applies and here is
one of his most controversial

00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:20.980
doctrines.
It must certainly apply to

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.181
matters of opinion to what we
would call today First Amendment

00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:25.870
issues.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.809
This is something that Hobbes
insists upon.

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:35.577
"For the actions of men," he
says, "proceed from their

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:38.639
opinions.
Actions proceed from opinions.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:43.198
And in the well governing of
opinions consisteth the well

00:12:43.198 --> 00:12:47.942
governing of men's actions."
So, if we are going to govern

00:12:47.942 --> 00:12:52.466
or regulate human behavior,
we have to begin by regulating

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:54.554
opinion.
And it follows from this,

00:12:54.554 --> 00:12:56.596
Hobbes believes,
that the sovereign has the

00:12:56.596 --> 00:13:00.568
right to decide what opinions,
what books, what ideas are

00:13:00.568 --> 00:13:05.850
conducive to peace and which
ones aim simply to stir up war

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.490
and discontent?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.795
And these comments of Hobbes'
about the sovereign's power to

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:18.299
control opinions are directed at
two principal institutions,

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:25.316
the Church and,
guess what the other one is,

00:13:25.316 --> 00:13:30.748
the university.
Both of these for Hobbes he

00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:35.474
considers to be locus,
the focus of or centers of

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:40.889
seditious opinion that require
to remain under sovereign

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:43.378
control.
By the churches,

00:13:43.378 --> 00:13:46.776
Hobbes is speaking of the
reformed church but,

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:50.987
in particular,
he is concerned with those

00:13:50.987 --> 00:13:57.741
radical puritan sects of the
type that later came and founded

00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:01.023
America,
these radical sects that

00:14:01.023 --> 00:14:05.792
elevate matters of conscience
and private belief over and

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:08.859
above the law,
that is to say arrogating to

00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:11.981
themselves, to the rights of
conscience and the private

00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.433
belief,
the powers to judge the

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:16.915
sovereign.
It was these dissenting

00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:19.811
Protestants, it was these
dissenting sects,

00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:23.947
that formed the rank and file
of Cromwell's armies during the

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:27.861
Civil War in England.
They formed the rank and file

00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:32.104
of the republican armies in
England against the rule of the

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.990
king.
And, Hobbes tell us he would

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.507
banish all doctrines that
profess to make the individual

00:14:39.507 --> 00:14:42.631
or the sect,
more importantly in some ways

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.110
the sect, the judge of the
sovereign.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.215
It is only in the state of
nature, he tells us,

00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:52.266
that individuals have the right
to determine just and unjust,

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:56.635
right and wrong for themselves.
Once we enter society,

00:14:56.635 --> 00:15:00.738
once we engage or conclude the
social compact,

00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:05.387
we transfer our power to do
this to the sovereign to

00:15:05.387 --> 00:15:11.192
determine these matters for us.
And just as important as the

00:15:11.192 --> 00:15:16.237
radical churches and the
reformed sects is for Hobbes the

00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:20.592
university and its curriculum.
In particular,

00:15:20.592 --> 00:15:25.333
Hobbes faults the universities
for teaching what,

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:30.666
for teaching the radical
doctrines of Aristotleanism in

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:36.079
the seventeenth century.
Aristotle in this period was

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:40.995
the source of modern republican
ideas, ideas about self

00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:44.484
government,
ideas about in some ways what

00:15:44.484 --> 00:15:48.990
we might call direct democracy
or participatory democracy,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.303
people who believe that the
only legitimate form of

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:55.683
government is one where
Aristotle says citizens take

00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:58.399
turns ruling and being ruled in
turn.

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:02.465
It was, above all,
the influence of the classics,

00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:05.600
Aristotle and Cicero in
particular,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.960
that Hobbes regards as an
important cause for the recent

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.289
civil war and the regicide of
Charles I.

00:16:13.289 --> 00:16:16.523
Consider the following passage
that he writes:

00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:19.110
"As to rebellion against
monarchy,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.390
one of the most frequent causes
is the reading of the books of

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.179
policy and history of the
ancient Greeks and Romans.

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:31.662
Reading of those books leads
people to rebel against

00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:35.970
monarchy, for which young men
like yourselves,"

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.875
he says, or young women too,
"for which young men and all

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:44.200
others that are unprovided by
the antidote of solid reason,"

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.028
who are susceptible that is to
reading these stories and

00:16:48.028 --> 00:16:51.438
reading these books,
"receive a strong and

00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:56.179
delightful impression of the
great exploits of war."

00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:59.465
"From reading of such books,"
Hobbes continues,

00:16:59.465 --> 00:17:03.536
"men have undertaken to kill
their kings because the Greek

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:08.106
and Latin writers in their books
and discourses of policy make it

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:12.463
lawful and laudable for any man
to do so provided before he do

00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:16.639
it he call him a tyrant."
That's what you learn,

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:20.361
Hobbes believes,
from the reading of Aristotle

00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:24.248
and the Greeks and Romans,
regicide, that the only

00:17:24.248 --> 00:17:28.065
legitimate form of government is
a republic and that it is a

00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:31.430
lawful and even it's your duty
to kill your king.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.352
Of course, before doing so,
he says, "you must call him

00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:40.180
first a tyrant."
It's a wonderful passage.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.416
And this is so interesting,
I think, not only because of

00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:48.113
its humor and Hobbes' in many
ways characteristic

00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:52.258
exaggerations,
but because it shows how much

00:17:52.258 --> 00:17:56.730
emphasis Hobbes puts on the
reform of opinion,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.317
the reform of ideas,
in many ways like Machiavelli

00:18:00.317 --> 00:18:05.876
and like Plato too before him,
Hobbes regards himself as an

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:11.850
educator of princes,
an educator and a transformer,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.014
a reformer of ideas.
There is a kind of internal

00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:19.150
irony here I think because
Hobbes sometimes writes as if,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.018
as we've seen,
as if human beings are nothing

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.929
more than complex machines that
mechanically obey the laws of

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:29.721
attraction and repulsion.
But he also obviously writes

00:18:29.721 --> 00:18:34.001
that we are beings with will and
purpose who are uniquely guided

00:18:34.001 --> 00:18:37.148
by opinions,
ideas, and doctrines and it is

00:18:37.148 --> 00:18:41.334
in many ways the first business
of the sovereign to act as a

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:45.696
moral reformer of ideas.
Hobbes realizes this is a

00:18:45.696 --> 00:18:51.079
difficult and uphill task that
he has set for himself.

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:56.258
And, in a rare moment of sort
of personal self-reflection or

00:18:56.258 --> 00:19:00.590
self-reference,
he notes somewhat drolly that

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:06.271
the novelty of his ideas will
make it difficult for them to

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:10.337
find an audience.
"I am at the point of

00:19:10.337 --> 00:19:14.754
believing, he says,
"that my labor will be as

00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:18.869
useless as the commonwealth of
Plato,"

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:22.411
he says in a moment of sort of
uncharacteristic despair,

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:25.759
"will be as useless as the
commonwealth of Plato."

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:29.525
"For Plato" he says "also is of
the opinion that it is

00:19:29.525 --> 00:19:33.930
impossible for the disorders of
the state ever to be taken away

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.630
until sovereigns be
philosophers."

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.639
And while, in many ways,
initially despairing of the

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:45.513
possibility of finding a sort of
friendly reception or audience

00:19:45.513 --> 00:19:49.320
for his work,
Hobbes then goes on in a more

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.688
optimistic note to observe that
his book is considerably simpler

00:19:54.688 --> 00:19:58.961
and easier to read than Plato's.
Again, you might have a

00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:01.880
discussion about that over which
is the easier one.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.955
But, Hobbes believes it is
simpler and easier and therefore

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:09.820
more likely to catch the ear of
a sympathetic prince.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.233
"I recover some hope," he says.
"I recover some hope that one

00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:18.109
time or other this writing of
mine may fall into the hands of

00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:21.210
a sovereign who will consider it
for himself,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.990
for it is short and I think
clear."

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.671
Well, we might question that.
He says it's a short book and

00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:33.319
"I think clear" he writes.
Well, it's complex and long.

00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:35.703
But nevertheless,
perhaps hoping that his

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:39.397
advertising it in this way will
gain the ear of a sovereign and

00:20:39.397 --> 00:20:41.839
that "without the help" he
continues,

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:46.429
"of any interested or envious
interpreter and by the exercise

00:20:46.429 --> 00:20:50.559
of entire sovereignty in
protecting the public teaching

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.996
of it convert this truth of
speculation into the utility of

00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:58.691
practice,"
the very end of chapter 31,

00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:04.000
"will convert this truth of
speculation into the utility of

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.728
practice."
So, Hobbes clearly believes or

00:21:07.728 --> 00:21:12.465
thinks that this will be a
useful book for a sovereign to

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:17.711
read and hoping it will gain the
ear of a sympathetic sovereign

00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:20.080
or potential sovereign.

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:26.427
Hobbes may, I think,
overestimate or maybe I really

00:21:26.427 --> 00:21:29.992
should say underestimate the
difficulty of the book but he

00:21:29.992 --> 00:21:33.869
returns to this again at the
very end of Leviathan.

00:21:33.869 --> 00:21:36.862
"The universities" he says
there, where he talks again a

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:39.309
little bit about the audience
for the book,

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:43.724
"the universities," he says,
" are the fountains of civil

00:21:43.724 --> 00:21:47.028
and moral doctrine.
The universities are the

00:21:47.028 --> 00:21:51.151
fountains of civil and moral
doctrine and have the obligation

00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:54.930
to teach the correct doctrine of
rights and duties."

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.662
And this means for Hobbes,
first of all,

00:21:57.662 --> 00:22:01.516
adopting his book as the
authoritative teaching on moral

00:22:01.516 --> 00:22:04.809
and political doctrine in the
universities.

00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:09.805
This should be the required
textbook of political science of

00:22:09.805 --> 00:22:14.208
political teaching in the
universities to replace the

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:16.240
older textbook,
i.e.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.799
Aristotle's Politics.
"Therefore," he says,

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:23.720
"I think it may be profitably
printed and more profitably

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.569
taught in the universities," he
confidently asserts.

00:22:27.569 --> 00:22:30.797
"The ideal audience for the
book," he says "should be the

00:22:30.797 --> 00:22:33.092
preachers, the gentry,
the lawyers,

00:22:33.092 --> 00:22:36.514
men of affairs,
who drawing such water as they

00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:41.311
find from the book can use it,"
he says, "to sprinkle the same

00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:45.439
both from the pulpit and from
their conversation upon the

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:47.237
people."
This is how he sees it,

00:22:47.237 --> 00:22:49.039
that it should be taught from
the pulpit.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:52.720
It should be taught from the
universities and from this

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.059
conversation will be sprinkled
upon the people.

00:22:56.059 --> 00:22:59.718
Hobbes' hope,
like that of all the great

00:22:59.718 --> 00:23:04.689
political philosophers,
was to be a kind of legislator

00:23:04.689 --> 00:23:08.137
for mankind.
This again is a book with epic,

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:09.080
epic ambition.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.065
Let me mention,
I've emphasized in many ways

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:24.180
the absolutist and authoritarian
side of Hobbes' teaching.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.839
Let me talk about something
that might sound oxymoronic.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:31.809
Let me call it for the moment
Hobbesian liberalism.

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:36.182
Hobbes enjoys describing the
sovereign in the most absolute

00:23:36.182 --> 00:23:40.153
and extreme terms.
Sovereign is to have supreme

00:23:40.153 --> 00:23:43.848
command over life and death,
war and peace,

00:23:43.848 --> 00:23:48.529
what is to be taught and heard.
And yet, in many ways,

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:52.830
this Hobbesian sovereign aims
to allow for ample room for

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.110
individual liberty.
And he even sets some limits on

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.369
the legitimate use of sovereign
power.

00:24:00.369 --> 00:24:04.818
For all of his tough talk,
Hobbes takes justice and the

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:09.019
rule of law very seriously,
far more seriously than,

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:11.819
for example,
does Machiavelli.

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:16.305
At one time in the book or at
one point he maintains that a

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:21.177
person cannot be made to accuse
themselves without the assurance

00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:24.146
of pardon.
You can't be forced to accuse

00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:27.400
yourself, what we could call the
Fifth Amendment.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.779
You cannot be forced to accuse
yourself.

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:32.933
Similarly, he says,
a wife or a parent cannot be

00:24:32.933 --> 00:24:36.747
coerced to accuse a loved one.
And, in a similar point,

00:24:36.747 --> 00:24:40.292
he maintains that punishment
can never be used as an

00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:44.601
instrument of revenge but only
for what he calls the correction

00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:48.910
or what we would call the
rehabilitation of the offender.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:54.250
Add to the above Hobbes'
repeated insistence that law

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.900
serve as an instrument for
achieving social equality.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.903
In a chapter called,
"Of the Office of the Sovereign

00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:08.063
Representative," Hobbes argues
that justice be equally

00:25:08.063 --> 00:25:11.359
administered to all classes of
people,

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:15.940
rich, as well as poor,
equal application of justice.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:21.390
He maintains further the titles
of nobility are of value only

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:27.021
for the benefits they confer on
those of lesser rank or they're

00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:30.074
not useful at all.
Equal justice,

00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:33.239
he tells us,
requires equal taxation policy

00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:37.835
and he seems to be proposing a
kind of consumption tax so that

00:25:37.835 --> 00:25:41.323
the rich,
who consume more will have to

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:45.049
pay their fair share.
And he argues that indigent

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:48.670
citizens, who are unable to
provide for themselves,

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.310
should not be forced to rely
simply upon the private charity

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:58.029
of individuals but should be
maintained at public expense.

00:25:58.029 --> 00:26:02.204
He seems, in this way,
to anticipate what we might

00:26:02.204 --> 00:26:07.402
think of as the modern welfare
state that public assistance be

00:26:07.402 --> 00:26:09.629
provided,
and the poor,

00:26:09.629 --> 00:26:14.540
not simply depend on the
private goodwill of the others.

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:22.395
But most importantly,
I think, is to go back to the

00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:26.403
importance given to the
individual in Hobbes'

00:26:26.403 --> 00:26:29.853
philosophy.
Hobbes derives the very power

00:26:29.853 --> 00:26:33.947
of the sovereign from the
natural right of each individual

00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:37.180
to do as they like in the state
of nature.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.603
And it follows,
I think, that the purpose of

00:26:40.603 --> 00:26:45.060
the sovereign is really to
safeguard the natural right of

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.837
each individual but to regulate
this right so that it becomes

00:26:49.837 --> 00:26:54.374
consistent with the right of
others and not simply again a

00:26:54.374 --> 00:26:59.713
kind of open war against all.
What is significant about this,

00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:04.037
I think, is the priority that
Hobbes gives to rights over

00:27:04.037 --> 00:27:06.859
duties.
This, in many ways arguably,

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:11.323
makes him the founding father
or maybe we should say godfather

00:27:11.323 --> 00:27:15.646
of modern liberalism,
the importance given to rights

00:27:15.646 --> 00:27:20.950
over duties, of the individual
over in many ways the collective

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.570
or common good.
And I think this is expressed

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.660
in Hobbes' novel and in many
ways altogether unprecedented

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.529
teaching about liberty in
chapter 21,

00:27:31.529 --> 00:27:34.210
a very famous and important
chapter.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.620
And here he distinguishes the
liberty of, what he calls the

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.290
liberty of the ancients,
or what he doesn't exactly call

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.640
but I'll call the liberty of the
ancients and the liberty of the

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.693
moderns.
The ancients,

00:27:47.693 --> 00:27:51.376
he believes,
operated with a defective

00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:56.147
understanding of human freedom.
For the ancients,

00:27:56.147 --> 00:28:00.148
liberty meant living in a
self-governing republic,

00:28:00.148 --> 00:28:04.965
living in a republic in which
everyone again took some share

00:28:04.965 --> 00:28:09.107
in the ruling offices.
Liberty, in other words,

00:28:09.107 --> 00:28:13.950
for the ancients was not just a
property of the individual.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.642
It was an attribute of the
regime of which one was a

00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:21.595
member.
"The Athenians and the Romans,"

00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:24.474
he says, "were free,
that is they were free

00:28:24.474 --> 00:28:27.854
commonwealths,
not that any particular man had

00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:31.853
the liberty to resist his own
representative but that his

00:28:31.853 --> 00:28:35.781
representative had the liberty
to resist or invade other

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:37.751
people."
In other words,

00:28:37.751 --> 00:28:40.944
liberty for the ancients was a
collective good,

00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:43.930
the liberty,
as he says, to resist or invade

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.887
other people.
It was a property of the

00:28:46.887 --> 00:28:50.730
commonwealth not of the
individuals who inhabited it.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.429
But that sense of collective
liberty, the freedom to resist

00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:58.751
or invade is,
in fact, even opposed to the

00:28:58.751 --> 00:29:02.640
modern idea of liberty that
Hobbes proposes.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.751
And by liberty Hobbes means
something that sounds very

00:29:05.751 --> 00:29:08.883
familiar to us.
Liberty means the absence of

00:29:08.883 --> 00:29:11.779
constraints or impediments to
action.

00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:16.079
We are free to the extent that
we can act in an unimpeded

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:19.507
manner.
And, it follows from him that

00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:24.983
political liberty means the
freedom to act where the law is

00:29:24.983 --> 00:29:27.983
silent, as he says.
Think of that,

00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:31.744
that where the law is silent,
we have the freedom to do or

00:29:31.744 --> 00:29:35.420
not to do as we choose,
very important to the way we

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.549
think of liberty today in a
modern and you might say liberal

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:42.427
democracy.
Hobbes' sovereign is more

00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:47.150
likely to allow citizens a zone
of private liberty where they

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.872
are free to act as they choose
than in the classical republic

00:29:51.872 --> 00:29:56.516
where there is a kind of coerced
participation in collective

00:29:56.516 --> 00:29:59.980
affairs or in political
deliberation.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.387
And Hobbes here takes a dig at
the defenders of the view,

00:30:04.387 --> 00:30:07.692
in his own day,
that only the citizens of a

00:30:07.692 --> 00:30:11.476
republic can be free.
"There is written," he says,

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:15.304
"on the turrets of the city of
Lucca…" and let me just ask

00:30:15.304 --> 00:30:19.759
before I continue this passage,
anybody here in Pearson College?

00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:24.049
So, you will know the Dean Mr.
Amerigo, yeah,

00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:28.224
your dean?
Your dean is from the city of

00:30:28.224 --> 00:30:31.210
Lucca.
Ask him if this is true when

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.672
you see him.
"There is written on the

00:30:33.672 --> 00:30:36.498
turrets of the city of Lucca in
great characters,

00:30:36.498 --> 00:30:40.059
meaning great letters,
that this day the word

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:44.332
libertas,
libertas is written on

00:30:44.332 --> 00:30:49.079
the walls of the turrets of the
city of Lucca."

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.960
Let's find out if that's still
true.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.993
"Yet, no man," Hobbes
continues, "can thence infer

00:30:54.993 --> 00:30:59.768
that a particular man has more
liberty or immunity from the

00:30:59.768 --> 00:31:04.789
service of the commonwealth
there than in Constantinople,

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:09.079
the city of the Caliphs,
the Caliphate.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.359
Living in a republic alone
doesn't guarantee you more

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:14.779
freedom.
He says, freedom in that

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:17.912
interesting passage,
freedom here requires,

00:31:17.912 --> 00:31:20.745
as he puts it,
immunity, "immunity from

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:23.826
service."
A regime is to be judged for

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:27.825
Hobbes on how much private
liberty, how much immunity it

00:31:27.825 --> 00:31:32.426
grants each of its citizens,
an idea of individual liberty

00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:36.551
in many ways unknown and
unprecedented in the modern

00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:39.201
world.
And, in this respect,

00:31:39.201 --> 00:31:44.510
one can say that Hobbes has
some connection to the creation

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:49.544
of what we think of as the
modern liberal state with its

00:31:49.544 --> 00:31:54.303
conception of private freedom as
immunity from forced

00:31:54.303 --> 00:31:59.520
participation or forced
participation in politics,

00:32:02.829 --> 00:32:05.620
very different from the
ancients.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.380
So what does this all mean?

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:16.135
Let me talk about what Hobbes
has to say for us today,

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:21.269
we who have in many ways become
Hobbes' children.

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:27.170
Hobbes gives us the definitive
language of the modern state.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.849
Yet, he remains in many ways as
contested for us as he was in

00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:34.157
his own time.
For many today,

00:32:34.157 --> 00:32:37.949
Hobbes' conception of the
Leviathan state is

00:32:37.949 --> 00:32:41.210
synonymous with anti-liberal
absolutism.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.144
And yet for others,
he opened the door to John

00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:47.079
Locke and the liberal theory of
government.

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:51.041
He taught the priority of
rights over duties and he argued

00:32:51.041 --> 00:32:55.350
that the sovereign should serve
the lowly interest or the lowly

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.200
ends of providing peace and
security,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.389
leaving it to individuals to
determine for themselves how

00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:05.644
best to live their lives.
Nonetheless,

00:33:05.644 --> 00:33:11.817
the liberty that subjects enjoy
in Hobbes' plan falls in that

00:33:11.817 --> 00:33:17.269
area that he says the sovereign
omits to regulate.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:21.548
Hobbes does not praise
vigilance in defense of liberty

00:33:21.548 --> 00:33:26.069
and he denounces all efforts to
resist the government.

00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:30.713
At best, one could say Hobbes
is a kind of part-time liberal

00:33:30.713 --> 00:33:31.500
at best.

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:38.063
But Hobbes is best when he is
providing us with,

00:33:38.063 --> 00:33:41.011
in many ways,
the moral and psychological

00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:45.579
language in which we think about
government and the state.

00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:49.807
The state is a product of a
psychological struggle between

00:33:49.807 --> 00:33:53.069
the contending passions of pride
and fear.

00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:58.018
Fear, you will remember is
associated with the desire for

00:33:58.018 --> 00:34:00.492
security, order,
rationality,

00:34:00.492 --> 00:34:04.134
and peace.
Pride is connected with the

00:34:04.134 --> 00:34:07.341
love of glory,
honor, recognition and

00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:10.823
ambition.
All the goods of civilization,

00:34:10.823 --> 00:34:14.042
Hobbes tells us,
stem from our ability to

00:34:14.042 --> 00:34:17.644
control pride.
The very title of the book

00:34:17.644 --> 00:34:22.458
comes from this wonderful
biblical passage from Job where

00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:27.530
Leviathan is described as king
of the children of pride.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:32.500
And the 19 laws of nature that
Hobbes develops in his book

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.383
really are there simply to
enumerate or instruct us about

00:34:37.383 --> 00:34:41.219
the virtues of sociability and
civility,

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:47.909
especially directed against the
sin of pride or hubris.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:52.041
So, the modern state,
as we know it and still have

00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:57.184
it, in many ways grew out of the
Hobbesian desire for security

00:34:57.184 --> 00:35:02.327
and the fear of death that can
only be achieved at the expense

00:35:02.327 --> 00:35:05.699
of the desire for honor and
glory.

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:09.261
The Hobbesian state was
intended to secure the

00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:12.902
conditions of life,
even a highly civilized and

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:16.463
cultivated life but one
calculated in terms of

00:35:16.463 --> 00:35:19.550
self-interest and risk
avoidance.

00:35:23.289 --> 00:35:29.575
Hobbes wants us to be fearful
and to avoid dangerous courses

00:35:29.575 --> 00:35:34.583
of action that are inflamed by
beliefs in honor,

00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:40.130
ambition, and the like.
The Hobbesian fearful man is

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:45.374
not likely to become someone who
risks life for liberty,

00:35:45.374 --> 00:35:51.348
for honor, or for a cause.
He's more likely to be someone

00:35:51.348 --> 00:35:55.411
who plays by the rules,
avoids dangers,

00:35:55.411 --> 00:36:00.547
and bets on the sure thing.
The Hobbesian citizen is not

00:36:00.547 --> 00:36:04.402
likely to be a risk taker,
like a George Washington or an

00:36:04.402 --> 00:36:08.948
Andrew Carnegie.
He is more likely to think like

00:36:08.948 --> 00:36:13.231
an actuary or a CPA or an
insurance agent,

00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:19.081
always calculating the odds and
finding ways to cover the

00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:22.731
damages.
Later political theorists,

00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:28.018
like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and
Nietzsche would even develop a

00:36:28.018 --> 00:36:33.621
word for Hobbesian man.
They would call him somewhat

00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:38.419
contemptuously the bourgeois.
But nevertheless,

00:36:38.419 --> 00:36:42.166
Hobbes was remarkably
successful in converting us to

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:46.630
his point of view.
The type of individual he tried

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.927
to create, careful,
self-interested,

00:36:49.927 --> 00:36:53.553
risk averse,
this has become the dominant

00:36:53.553 --> 00:36:56.083
ethos of our
civilization,

00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:59.659
has it not?
We even have entire disciplines

00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:04.041
like economics and psychology
and I dare even say modern

00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:08.104
political science that
reinforced this view of human

00:37:08.104 --> 00:37:10.714
nature.
We have all become,

00:37:10.714 --> 00:37:15.070
whether we choose to admit it
or not, Hobbesians.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.436
And yet at the same time,
and here is the paradox I

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:24.675
think, even a Hobbesian society
cannot entirely exist without

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:30.264
some individuals who are willing
to risk life and limb either for

00:37:30.264 --> 00:37:34.740
the sake of honor,
for self-respect or even just

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.679
from the sheer joy that comes
from risk itself.

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:43.050
Remember my example on Monday
of Ralph Esposito.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.966
Why do people become firemen,
policemen, soldiers,

00:37:46.966 --> 00:37:50.643
freedom fighters,
all activities that cannot be

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:54.320
explained in terms of
self-interest alone?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.999
Will not even a Hobbesian
society again require fire

00:37:57.999 --> 00:38:01.655
departments?
And where will people come from

00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:05.922
that, if they all follow the
psychology of fear and

00:38:05.922 --> 00:38:10.360
self-interest that Hobbes wants
to instill in us?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.639
Hobbes regards these passions,
what Plato called by the word

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:18.311
thumos.
Hobbes regarded these passions

00:38:18.311 --> 00:38:22.915
in many ways as barbaric,
as uncivilized and warlike and

00:38:22.915 --> 00:38:27.691
to some degree he was right.
But even the Hobbesian state,

00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:31.452
Hobbes admits himself,
the Hobbesian state lives in

00:38:31.452 --> 00:38:35.451
the midst of a Hobbesian world;
that is to say,

00:38:35.451 --> 00:38:40.834
the world of international
relations is for Hobbes simply

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:46.406
the state of nature at large.
The Hobbesian state will always

00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:49.627
exist in a world of hostile
other states,

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:53.010
unregulated by some kind of
higher law.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.844
States stand to one another on
the world stage as individuals

00:38:56.844 --> 00:38:59.938
do in the condition of nature;
that is to say,

00:38:59.938 --> 00:39:03.643
potential enemies with no
higher authority by which to

00:39:03.643 --> 00:39:07.431
adjudicate their conflicts.
And in such a world,

00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:12.336
even a sovereign state will be
endangered either from other

00:39:12.336 --> 00:39:16.903
states or from groups and
individuals devoted to terror

00:39:16.903 --> 00:39:24.079
and destruction.
Think of September 11,2001.

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:27.962
This is a problem that a
profound political scientist by

00:39:27.962 --> 00:39:31.683
the name of Pierre Hassner,
a French student of

00:39:31.683 --> 00:39:36.352
international politics,
has described as the dialectic

00:39:36.352 --> 00:39:39.699
of the bourgeois and the
barbarian,

00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:43.340
a struggle that is to say
between the modern Hobbesian

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.667
state with its largely pacified
and satisfied citizen bodies and

00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:51.856
those pre-modern states or maybe
in some ways even post-modern

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:56.389
states that are prepared to use
the instruments of violence,

00:39:56.389 --> 00:40:00.690
terror and suicide bombings to
achieve their goals.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.101
A Hobbesian state,
paradoxically,

00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:07.245
still requires from its
citizens, men and women prepared

00:40:07.245 --> 00:40:11.541
to fight to risk everything in
the defense of their way of

00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:14.645
life.
But the Hobbesian point,

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:19.576
the paradox being that the
Hobbesian bourgeois cannot

00:40:19.576 --> 00:40:24.506
entirely dispense with the
barbarian, even in its own

00:40:24.506 --> 00:40:28.930
midst.
Can Hobbes explain this paradox?

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:33.722
He seems to avoid it.
This problem has been brought

00:40:33.722 --> 00:40:38.466
out I think brilliantly in a
recent book by a man named James

00:40:38.466 --> 00:40:42.340
Bowman, a book called Honor:
a History.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.430
He wrote a history of honor.

00:40:46.539 --> 00:40:50.208
And here he points out that
while affairs of honor,

00:40:50.208 --> 00:40:54.671
as they are quaintly called,
have largely disappeared from

00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:58.803
advanced societies but honor
still remains a consuming

00:40:58.803 --> 00:41:03.247
passion in many parts of the
world today including for him

00:41:03.247 --> 00:41:06.210
most importantly the Middle
East.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.990
Honor, in most societies,
is thought to be not merely a

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.531
personal quality,
something like medieval

00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:18.250
chivalry but is above all group
honor,

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:22.279
the honor that surrounds the
family, the extended clan,

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:27.694
or the religious sect.
An assault on one is an assault

00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:30.856
on all.
This helps us to explain,

00:41:30.856 --> 00:41:34.419
for instance,
why in so many cultures the

00:41:34.419 --> 00:41:38.159
concept of saving face is so
important,

00:41:38.159 --> 00:41:43.000
even if to most modern
Americans it seems relatively

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.109
trivial.
And one reason Bowman believes

00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:50.285
this is that we have such a
difficult time in understanding

00:41:50.285 --> 00:41:54.316
other peoples and other cultures
is that the very idea of

00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:58.132
defending one's honor has
largely been devalued in the

00:41:58.132 --> 00:42:01.276
modern west.
We tend to look at human

00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:05.126
behavior as a matter of
providing rational incentives

00:42:05.126 --> 00:42:07.940
for human action while most
people,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.787
in fact, are driven by a need
for esteem and a desire to avoid

00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:17.000
humiliation.
I remember, for example,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.052
during the Vietnam War when
Richard Nixon spoke about

00:42:21.052 --> 00:42:26.593
achieving peace with honor,
and this was largely mocked as

00:42:26.593 --> 00:42:31.632
a kind of ludicrous idea.
Honor to so many of us sounds

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:35.690
quaint, like an honor code or
the Boy Scouts' code or

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.280
something like that or something
primitive,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.573
some kind of primitive ethic
which we therefore don't really

00:42:43.573 --> 00:42:47.380
understand.
We don't often see that it was

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.623
in large parts Hobbes' efforts
to discredit this kind of

00:42:52.623 --> 00:42:57.315
warrior virtue,
this kind of virtue of honor

00:42:57.315 --> 00:43:02.203
that is so much a part of
cultures that is also

00:43:02.203 --> 00:43:06.559
responsible for our current
blindness.

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:11.149
And that brings me to my final
point about our Hobbesian

00:43:11.149 --> 00:43:16.489
civilization that conceals from
us a very uncomfortable truth.

00:43:16.489 --> 00:43:19.561
Peace, the peace,
security, and safety,

00:43:19.561 --> 00:43:23.441
what we might call our
bourgeois freedoms that we

00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:25.563
enjoy,
rest on the fact,

00:43:25.563 --> 00:43:29.967
on the uncomfortable fact,
that there are still people who

00:43:29.967 --> 00:43:34.525
are willing to risk their lives
for the sake of higher goals

00:43:34.525 --> 00:43:39.688
like honor or duty.
Is that irrational for them to

00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:43.980
do so?
Hobbes would believe it is.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.205
I think he would say yes.
It doesn't make sense from a

00:43:47.205 --> 00:43:52.201
purely Hobbesian point of view
that encourages us to think like

00:43:52.201 --> 00:43:56.874
rational actors interested
mainly in safety and beating the

00:43:56.874 --> 00:43:59.720
odds.
Hobbes, in many ways,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:05.259
finds himself in the position
of the young military lawyer

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:11.090
played in the following movie
clip I'm going to show you.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.470
Professor Steven Smith:
Okay, is the point made?

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.656
The point is made.
Then I will not even provide

00:44:17.656 --> 00:44:20.716
any further commentary.
I only apologize that for some

00:44:20.716 --> 00:44:23.000
reason I couldn't get the
picture.

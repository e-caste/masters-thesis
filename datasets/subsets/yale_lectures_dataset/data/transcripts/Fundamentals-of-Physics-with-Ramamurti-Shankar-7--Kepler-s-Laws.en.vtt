00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.668
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I thought before

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:06.218
going into today's topic,
I will give you a five-minute

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:08.060
summary of what happened last
time.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.223
So, you guys are saying,
"Look, it looks like you got

00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.028
carried away with this thing;
we just want to know what we

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.250
need to become good doctors,
so just tell us."

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.079
So, if you're a doctor or a
lawyer or -- I've had really

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.256
strong students in my class who
had nothing to do with any of

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.570
the sciences,
physics or chemistry,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.370
which of course is a great
pleasure for me to know.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.175
So, if you go forward into your
life's mission,

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:36.920
what should you know from the
last lecture?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.462
Here's the main point.
The Law of Conservation of

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:45.054
Energy is a powerful concept
that I told you,

00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:48.320
survives even the quantum
revolution.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.734
So, it looks like we may
ascribe to a system something

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:55.181
called the total energy,
which is the kinetic energy,

00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.206
which is always Â½
mv^(2),

00:00:57.206 --> 00:01:00.750
and potential energy which
depends on the location of the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.166
object,
and it varies from problem to

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.650
problem, depending on whether
they're connected to a spring or

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.078
gravity and so on.
In one dimension,

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:13.123
we could always get to the
potential energy for any force

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:17.943
that depended only on location.
The trick was to go back to the

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:21.526
Work Energy Theorem,
which just applies Newton's

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:25.796
laws and says the change in
kinetic energy of the body is

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:31.168
the work done by the body,
and that work we defined to be

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:33.622
this;
then, the sum of all this,

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:37.327
on the left-hand side,
would be the change in kinetic

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:39.388
energy.
On the right-hand side,

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:42.085
this would become an integral
of F, from

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.900
x_1 to
x_2.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.070
And if F really is a
function of x and not of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.640
also velocity,
the laws of calculus tell you,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240
you may write this integral as
the difference of two numbers.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.002
Then, you rearrange the
expression to get

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.560
K_1 +
U_1;

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.304
U_1 is
shorthand for U of

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:05.673
x_1;
is K_2 +

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:08.539
U_2.
And that means the energy

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.615
E_1,
to begin with the energy at the

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.299
end.
If there is a frictional force,

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.107
then in this integral you break
it up into two parts:

00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:21.182
the part, say,
due to a spring and the part

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:24.287
due to friction.
The part due to a spring will

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:27.273
integrate to give you this.
Then, you'll still have the

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.792
part due to friction left over.
In that case the result will

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.590
look like (K_2 +
U_2) - (K_1

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.334
+ U_1).
Instead of being zero,

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.449
it will be the work done by
friction.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.283
We write it symbolically this
way but the frictional force is

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:45.520
not a function of x
alone,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.566
but if knew which path you're
taking and which way you're

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:50.470
moving, you can do that
integral.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.970
You want to do this in higher
dimensions.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.475
In higher dimensions,
what I found out was that if

00:02:56.475 --> 00:03:00.909
you wanted the change of kinetic
energy to be the work done,

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.736
then what you had to do was to
write this expression,

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:10.006
which was a shorthand for
F_x,

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:15.103
dx + F_y dy.
So, you take a point and you go

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:18.120
to a neighboring point,
that's the work done;

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.958
and this work done was cooked
up so that it was a change in

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.460
kinetic energy.
Then you say,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.349
okay, let me take a finite
path, starting with some point

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.568
r_1 and going
to some point

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:31.340
r_2.
Then, I add up all the changes.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.915
The left-hand side is
K_2 -

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:34.894
K_1,
and the right-hand side is this

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:35.420
integral.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.800
This is always true.
This will never be wrong.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.110
It's just a restatement of
Newton's law.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.432
The problem will be,
can we write this integral here

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:54.440
as a difference of two numbers,
one depending on the starting

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.320
point and one depending on the
ending point?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.590
Is this possible?
That's a question mark.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.255
If it's possible,
you are done,

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:05.698
because you're back to writing
K_1 + U_1

00:04:05.698 --> 00:04:07.919
= K_2 +
U_2.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.348
But I tried to convince you
that it's not always going to

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:13.746
happen.
So, let's understand why it's

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:16.709
not always going to happen.
It is not enough in this

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.919
integral to say,
start at r_1

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.540
and go to r_2.
In fact, if I just said,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.679
find the integral of the work
done by the force between

00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:25.620
r_1 and
r_2,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.808
you will have to tell
me--you'll have to ask me

00:04:27.808 --> 00:04:29.790
something.
You agree?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.208
What will you ask in addition,
besides just saying start at

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:36.449
r_1 and end at
r_2?

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.879
Student: What happens in
between.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.147
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You will ask,

00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:41.239
"What path did you take?"
And unless you specify the path

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.643
you cannot do the integral,
because you don't know what

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:46.354
contour you want to draw.
Therefore, the answer in

00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:49.832
general depends on the path,
but this right-hand side does

00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:52.076
not.
So, if you pick the same two

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:55.190
endpoints and you vary that path
into this one,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.459
the right-hand side doesn't
change, but it's not hard to

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:59.440
imagine the left-hand side would
be different.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.230
Therefore, in general this will
not be true.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.986
So, even though there's a
relation between work done and

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:08.589
increase in kinetic energy,
you will not get a law of

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.459
conservation of energy,
unless this is true.

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.328
Then I said,
there is still hope because we

00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:18.128
can, in fact,
manufacture forces for which

00:05:18.128 --> 00:05:20.784
this is true.
To manufacture the force,

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:24.372
you pick any function U,
of x and y that

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:27.185
you like,
then define a new force whose

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:31.377
x component is minus the
derivative of U with

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:34.662
respect to x,
and whose y component is

00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:37.331
the minus the derivative of
U with respect to

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.495
y.
Then, you got to go back and

00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:42.839
look at your notes and see that
if you take F.dr now,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.543
you're just adding the change
in U, and when you go

00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:48.199
from start to finish the total
change will in fact be the

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.221
change in U,
from start to finish,

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.949
and won't depend on how you got
there.

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.920
So basically,
what you're doing is,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.457
in the xy plane you are
defining a function U of

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.660
xy, which is like a
height.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.143
You defined the force in a
clever way so that F.dr

00:06:03.143 --> 00:06:05.879
is the change in the height,
as you march.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.099
So, you can start at any point
on the mountain,

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.029
go to any other point on the
mountain;

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.885
if you're only keeping track of
the change in height you're

00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:15.839
going to get the same answer,
no matter how you got from here

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.393
to there.
So, you start with a potential

00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:21.263
and work out a force,
and that force will then

00:06:21.263 --> 00:06:24.579
obviously give an answer that's
path independent,

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:27.224
and the potential associated
with the force is the function

00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:28.693
you began with.
In other words,

00:06:28.693 --> 00:06:30.497
in this problem then,
K_1 +

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:32.486
U_1 will be
K_2 +

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:35.506
U_2,
where U is the same guy

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:38.029
you began with.
So, you can get a law of

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.310
conservation of energy in that
case.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.519
Then, I told you without proof
that this is the only way it can

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.049
happen.
In other words,

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:49.848
we all agree that if you got a
force from a potential by taking

00:06:49.848 --> 00:06:52.706
derivatives, it does the job.
But I'm saying,

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.291
every force whose integral is
independent of path will always

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.920
have as its ancestor a function
U,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.198
and the x component of
the force will be the x

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.283
derivative of the function and
the y will be the

00:07:03.283 --> 00:07:05.352
y derivative.
That's not obvious,

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:08.838
but in other words it's clear
it's sufficient but it's also

00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:11.665
necessary.
So, every conservative force is

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:15.029
the derivative of some
potential, in this fashion.

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.805
Finally, I said if someone
comes and gives you a force and

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:21.189
says, "Is it conservative or
not?"

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.389
either you can think in your
head and try to guess that

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.174
function U,
of which this F is the

00:07:27.174 --> 00:07:29.813
derivative, in this fashion.
If you succeed,

00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:31.884
you know it's conservative;
if you fail,

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:35.363
maybe it's not conservative or
maybe you are not clever enough

00:07:35.363 --> 00:07:38.600
in finding that function.
So, here is a recipe that works

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.590
for all of this.
The recipe is:

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.096
take the force,
take the d by dy

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:47.940
of F_x,
and compare it to d by

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.920
dx of
F_y,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.360
and if they're equal,
it's a conservative force.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.990
That's the summary of last
lecture.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.160
How much of a detail you want
to know is entirely up to you.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.293
Okay, so now--so I'm going
to--This is residual from last

00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:16.088
time.
So, I'm going to basically hide

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:17.224
that.
If you want,

00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:19.329
you can take a few moments
writing it down.

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:21.259
But you understand the point
now.

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:22.758
The point is,
there are--In fact,

00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:25.052
if you think about it,
it's fairly miraculous that

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:27.627
there are forces in nature so
that the work done by them

00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:30.529
doesn't depend on how you got
from A to B.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:34.981
Even more interesting is that
all the fundamental forces that

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.376
we know -- gravity,
electrostatics,

00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:40.331
even the strong force,
weak force, every force that we

00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:43.621
know to the extent it can be
described by a force -- happens

00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:46.525
to be conservative.
So, it's not that we are hung

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.470
up on some rather exceptional
case;

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.960
nature is kind enough that all
the forces are conservative.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.450
Now, friction is a little
tricky.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.654
You might say,
"Well, friction is not

00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:56.785
conservative."
But friction is not a

00:08:56.785 --> 00:08:59.536
microscopic force;
friction is a gross,

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:03.522
average way to describe things,
at some real fundamental level

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:06.070
every force is in fact
conservative.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:12.597
Anyway, gravity is conservative
and then the electrostatic force

00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:16.828
is conservative also.
So, when we study conservative

00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:19.970
systems, we are studying
something fairly general.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.501
So, today I go to one of the
famous conservative problems

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:27.820
which is the gravitational
interaction.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.309
So, the situation was as
follows at Newton's time.

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:38.420
You know that Copernicus
proposed that the way to think

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.759
about our Solar System is to put
the Sun at the center.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:47.809
Now, so here is Copernicus'
picture.

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:49.450
Here's the Sun,
here are the various planets.

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:56.880
You have to agree that's very
remarkable.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.795
Okay?
First of all,

00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:01.636
it's remarkable because that
was the period when you--It was

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:04.139
not "publish or perish" but
"publish and perish."

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.168
It was not a good thing to come
out and say what you thought,

00:10:07.168 --> 00:10:10.705
and he still did that.
Even independent of the social

00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:15.279
risk, how did anybody figure
this out, because even today,

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:18.320
even when I know this is true,
I look around,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.500
it doesn't look like this at
all to my eyes.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.112
So, on a good day,
I flatter myself into thinking

00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:27.159
I could have maybe discovered
this or discovered that.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.760
There is no way I would have
done this.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.740
This is really amazing.
Go out and look.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.440
Because what you are saying is,
if you look at our Solar System

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.400
from far away it's going to look
like this.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.600
That's fine.
But what is our vantage point?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.188
We are sitting on third rock
and we're going around and we

00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:47.028
somehow think we are at rest and
everything is spinning around

00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:50.201
the opposite way.
And to deduce from that chaos

00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:52.820
this simple picture is quite
remarkable.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.917
You got a lot of points just
for saying this is what's

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.944
happened.
That was a big--It was properly

00:10:58.944 --> 00:11:01.559
called the Copernican
Revolution.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:04.464
After the Copernican
Revolution, people just said,

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:08.079
take the data we get with this
as the center and transcribe it

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.450
with that as the center and plot
it.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.791
So the person,
Tycho Brahe who was a rich guy

00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:17.893
who had his own lab and he
studied the Solar System and

00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:21.918
Kepler was an assistant who
carried on the work for 40

00:11:21.918 --> 00:11:22.830
years.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:30.975
For 40 years he studied this
problem and he published his

00:11:30.975 --> 00:11:32.819
answers.
I got to tell you,

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.748
all of you who are going into
science, I would urge you not to

00:11:36.748 --> 00:11:38.809
publish every 40 years,
okay?

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:41.432
You're not going to get a job,
you're not going to get a

00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:43.529
Ph.D., you're not going to get a
post-doc;

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:46.779
you'll be a 70-year-old
post-doc, if you do this.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:48.600
So, the climate's very
different now.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.529
Even though we have a lot more
money for science,

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:55.068
I don't think we have science,
we have money for science of

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:57.994
such long vision.
The only example that comes to

00:11:57.994 --> 00:12:01.283
my mind is a work by Ray Davis
who looked for solar neutrinos

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:04.494
for about 30 years,
and fortunately his reputation

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:07.970
was so strong that funding
agencies kept him going.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.876
He looked at neutrinos from the
Sun for 30 years to be really

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.547
sure that there was a problem,
and he confronted the theorists

00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:18.620
with the problem and the problem
subsequently got resolved.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.064
But by and large people
published not a paper in 30

00:12:22.064 --> 00:12:26.266
years but rather the goal is 30
papers a year is more what you

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:28.611
want to do.
But you got to realize that

00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:30.700
we're not much smarter than our
ancestors.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.591
In fact, the possibility that
we have 30 excellent ideas a

00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:38.229
year is very unlikely.
So, I have to admire somebody

00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:42.434
like Kepler who after 40 years
gave us something that's really

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:45.370
solid gold,
because that's what triggered,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.129
that's what set Newton on the
right path.

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:51.250
So, there are three laws of
Kepler, okay?

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.600
So, three laws in 40 years.
Still better than Congress.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.551
Here is what he had.
The first law is,

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:06.089
"All planets go around the Sun
on an elliptical orbit with the

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:09.737
Sun as the focus."
So, I'm not going to write all

00:13:09.737 --> 00:13:11.879
the words, it'll take me forever
to write it;

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:16.334
I'll just say "elliptical
orbit," and you guys can get the

00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:19.460
precise text from any source you
like.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.981
But I have to remind you what
elliptical orbit means,

00:13:21.981 --> 00:13:23.790
right?
So everyone has to know what an

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.714
ellipse is.
So, you draw a circle,

00:13:25.714 --> 00:13:28.838
you take a thumbtack,
you stick it into your table,

00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:31.695
you take a string,
form a loop like that,

00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:34.996
put a pencil here,
and keep the pencil tight and

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:37.051
walk around,
keeping the distance,

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.301
you get a circle.
For an ellipse,

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:44.404
you take two thumbtacks and you
take a string like this,

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:48.950
keeping that length plus that
length constant,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.741
and you move,
keeping the string tight,

00:13:51.741 --> 00:13:54.899
and the shape you produce is
the ellipse.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.037
And these are the two focal
points, F_1 and

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:01.069
F_2.
An ellipse is an egg-shaped

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:04.622
circle and if you want to get
the circle back from the

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:06.480
ellipse,
you just move the two focal

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.680
points to a single point,
and you'll get the circle.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.815
Whereas a circle has only a
single number R,

00:14:15.815 --> 00:14:20.299
the radius characterizing it,
the ellipse has what's called a

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:23.614
major axis and a minor axis;
and major axis,

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:26.757
2a, and a is
called a semi-major axis,

00:14:26.757 --> 00:14:31.344
which is that distance.
So, do you know how you can get

00:14:31.344 --> 00:14:34.445
an ellipse?
Why the Greeks were studying

00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:36.400
ellipses?
Where they come from?

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.346
Yes?
Student: If you take two

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:44.038
points and you have one x
as a reflection of another one

00:14:44.038 --> 00:14:47.136
and you use the plane as a
section to cut through the

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.101
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:52.102
Shankar: Right,
these are called--

00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:56.379
Student: [inaudible]
cones at different angles,

00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:59.772
the outline of these cones,
if you cut a section,

00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:01.577
will be elliptical,
circular [inaudible]

00:15:01.577 --> 00:15:03.660
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.249
They'll be ellipse, circles;
they'll be various famous

00:15:06.249 --> 00:15:08.432
geometric figures.
I think for our purpose,

00:15:08.432 --> 00:15:11.387
even if you took a single cone
and you cut it at some angle,

00:15:11.387 --> 00:15:14.660
that would be an ellipse.
That's why the Greeks were

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.124
studying this.
But you need a second cone for

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.442
other things.
But for now,

00:15:18.442 --> 00:15:21.970
if you slice a cone parallel to
the base, you'll get a circle;

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.730
at an angle,
you'll get the ellipse.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.514
So, that's the first statement.
Second statement is the

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:33.347
following: If you pick one
planet and it's there today,

00:15:33.347 --> 00:15:37.667
you wait a week,
it's there, and you wait

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:43.302
another week it's there.
You join these two lines and

00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:49.200
you call that the area swept out
by the planet in the first week;

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.860
then, in the second week,
the area swept out is that.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.838
So, it's the area intercepted
by the two radial vectors and

00:15:56.838 --> 00:16:00.053
the arc along which you move.
And Kepler said the rate at

00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:03.720
which the area is swept out --
let dA/dt be a shorthand

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.327
for how much area is covered in
a certain time -- so you take

00:16:07.327 --> 00:16:09.483
area swept out,
divide by Ît,

00:16:09.483 --> 00:16:10.890
and he said that's a constant.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:23.199
And the third result is that,
let me see, the square of the

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:28.220
time it takes a planet to go
around the Sun,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:35.953
divided by the cube of the
orbit size, is the same for all

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.310
planets.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.230
These are the three laws of
Kepler.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.149
Yes?
Student: So why did you

00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:56.904
write [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:16:56.904 --> 00:17:00.225
Shankar: Well,
you don't need calculus to do

00:17:00.225 --> 00:17:04.193
what I just said.
Calculus says take the limit

00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:07.698
Ît goes to 0.
If Ît is one day or one

00:17:07.698 --> 00:17:11.269
month, it really doesn't matter.
Take a planet like Pluto -- I'm

00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:14.630
going to keep calling it a
planet because I'm attached to

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.990
Pluto more than to some of the
newer guys -- you wait one

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.819
month,
you see how much area is

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.500
covered, then wait another
month, you'll still find it's

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.413
true.
In fact, it happens to be true

00:17:24.413 --> 00:17:26.140
even if it's not
infinitesimally;

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.370
you can wait even finite
periods, but this is the limit.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.801
Yes?
Student: Are there in

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:34.980
fact slight deviations from
Kepler's third law?

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.036
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: There are lots of

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:39.339
deviations.
Student: [inaudible]

00:17:39.339 --> 00:17:40.140
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.504
Oh, okay.
There are lots of corrections

00:17:43.504 --> 00:17:45.814
to Kepler's laws.
First of all,

00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:48.509
Kepler's law,
if we really observe it very

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:52.059
carefully, none of these things
will actually work.

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:54.315
First of all,
planets are not moving just

00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:56.683
around the Sun,
they have the pull of other

00:17:56.683 --> 00:17:59.474
planets.
Secondly, the Newtonian law of

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:03.562
gravitation, which we'll study
today, has got modifications

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:07.509
from Einstein's theory,
which also modify the orbits.

00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:09.996
In fact, the truth is the
planets don't follow close

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:11.799
orbits at all but that the
ellipse,

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.793
instead of starting out this
way and staying this way

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.335
forever, slowly rotates,
and that's called the

00:18:17.335 --> 00:18:19.981
procession of the orbit.
And one of the biggest

00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:22.529
mysteries was Mercury had a
procession.

00:18:22.529 --> 00:18:26.053
In other words,
the orbit was not closing but

00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:30.858
like a Rosetta stone it is doing
this -- not at this rate but

00:18:30.858 --> 00:18:34.246
very, very slowly.
The majority of that procession

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:37.341
was fully understood by the
effects that I mentioned to you,

00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:39.859
namely the fact there are other
forces on it.

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:41.900
Jupiter, particularly,
is a very massive planet;

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.309
you cannot ignore this effect.
But still there was a tiny part

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:48.203
that was missing,
which is 43 degrees of an arc

00:18:48.203 --> 00:18:50.966
per century -- very,
very small deviation,

00:18:50.966 --> 00:18:53.600
left unexplained,
and the general theory of

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.807
relativity filled in that gap.
So, the answer is,

00:18:56.807 --> 00:19:00.281
every law I told you long back
will receive corrections,

00:19:00.281 --> 00:19:05.235
but they're usually very small.
Anyway, this was the data that

00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:09.173
was given to Newton.
So Newton, as you know,

00:19:09.173 --> 00:19:13.978
was sent home from college
because there was a plague and

00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:17.410
he went and lived in his old
village,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.428
and he was contemplating this
issue, because he had already by

00:19:22.428 --> 00:19:25.720
this time invented the laws of
motion,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.569
and I think he'd also invented
the basic ideas of calculus.

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:33.408
There was some debate about who
got there first but there was no

00:19:33.408 --> 00:19:36.525
debate about what happened next.
So Newton said,

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:40.080
"Okay, I am going to understand
planetary motion."

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.244
And so are you.
So, you guys have been terribly

00:19:44.244 --> 00:19:47.010
disappointed that after all the
work you've put in,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.440
you're still doing inclined
planes and pulleys and whatnot.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.877
So, today we're going to make a
big leap, because today you're

00:19:53.877 --> 00:19:56.920
going to understand how planets
move around the Sun.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.143
That's a mega problem, right?
The little ms you put in

00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:03.610
the equation are not mass of a
pulley or a plane,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.769
but mass of Jupiter or mass of
the Sun.

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:09.460
So, you're doing something of
cosmological proportions.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.600
And you don't need to know too
much more to do that.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.363
You're almost there.
So, I'm going to just tell you

00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:21.018
the one missing thing.
So, what Newton had done is to

00:20:21.018 --> 00:20:27.460
realize that in order to
understand motion of bodies,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.348
you have to associate a force
with acceleration and not with

00:20:31.348 --> 00:20:33.339
mass.
That was his contribution.

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:36.920
If you think it's forces that
cause velocity,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.500
you look at a planet going
around the Sun,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.266
where the velocity is pointing
in different directions at

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:45.983
different times and you have to
ask what can possibly be

00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:47.910
propelling the planet in this
loop,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.039
you don't get any definitive
answer.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:53.051
On the other hand,
if you calculate the

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:56.068
acceleration of the planet,
take the simple case where the

00:20:56.068 --> 00:21:00.196
planet's going on a circle.
The acceleration at every

00:21:00.196 --> 00:21:05.220
instant points towards the Sun.
Okay?

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.795
That's how--That's why it's
important to understand what

00:21:08.795 --> 00:21:12.230
forces are doing.
Forces are causing acceleration.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.059
So, Newton had already shown us.
And we have done many problems.

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:18.160
When a body accelerates there's
a reason for it.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.519
Well, all bodies are
accelerating towards the Sun.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:23.540
It's fairly clear what the
reason is.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.043
The reason is the Sun.
And you then postulate a force

00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:31.435
that's exerted by the Sun on the
planet that bends it into a

00:21:31.435 --> 00:21:34.326
circle.
And your job is to find out

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.740
that force.
What's the nature of the force?

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:42.683
So, it is again here that
Newton decided that the force

00:21:42.683 --> 00:21:49.397
that bends the planets around
the Sun is the same as the force

00:21:49.397 --> 00:21:53.910
that bends the Moon around the
Earth.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.610
It was known by then the Moon's
also going around the Earth.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.199
So, let's look at that problem.
So, here's the Earth,

00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:05.557
and here is the Moon,
and it's going around the

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:08.379
Earth.
Now, the Moon is accelerating

00:22:08.379 --> 00:22:12.181
towards the Earth and that's
something we have learned in

00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:17.184
this course.
Then, here is the famous apple,

00:22:17.184 --> 00:22:21.940
also accelerating towards the
Earth.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.067
And Newton decided that the
cause behind both the forces is

00:22:26.067 --> 00:22:28.630
a new force, the force of
gravity.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.380
The same thing that pulls the
apple is what pulls the Moon.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.137
So, we have to now ask,
"What is the nature of that

00:22:39.137 --> 00:22:42.279
force?"
We're going to write a formula

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:44.568
for the force.
First, let me look at the

00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:46.393
magnitude.
The direction is very clear,

00:22:46.393 --> 00:22:48.680
it is directed towards the
center of the Earth.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.925
So, I won't write that down.
Later on I will write you a

00:22:50.925 --> 00:22:52.539
formula with vector symbols in
it;

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.860
so the vector will point
towards the center of the Earth.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.990
But let's look at the magnitude.
If you take an apple here,

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.279
of mass m,
and you call M the mass

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:05.768
of the Earth,
near the Earth we all know the

00:23:05.768 --> 00:23:09.809
acceleration of a body is
constant.

00:23:09.809 --> 00:23:13.783
Therefore, it can happen only
if the force depends on the mass

00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:16.765
of the apple.
This force is going to depend

00:23:16.765 --> 00:23:19.292
on various things.
I'm going to write the formula,

00:23:19.292 --> 00:23:21.561
but one thing it depends on,
it's got to be proportional to

00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:24.334
the mass of the apple.
That's because then if you

00:23:24.334 --> 00:23:26.750
divide by m,
to get a,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.202
the mass drops out and you
understand the fact that

00:23:30.202 --> 00:23:33.930
everything near the Earth falls
at the same rate.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.556
The only way that can happen is
if the force depends on the mass

00:23:37.556 --> 00:23:40.808
of the apple.
We agreed that that m

00:23:40.808 --> 00:23:42.599
belongs there,
okay?

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.339
If it doesn't belong there,
if you have something that

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:47.391
depends on m squared,
for example,

00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.020
or it doesn't depend on
m at all,

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.689
you have a problem.
If the force doesn't depend on

00:23:51.689 --> 00:23:55.072
the mass at all -- suppose the
force on every body near the

00:23:55.072 --> 00:23:58.630
Earth was a constant force --
and then you divide by mass,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.948
you'll find that heavier
objects will have a smaller

00:24:00.948 --> 00:24:03.049
acceleration;
but that's not what you find.

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:06.049
So, there's a perfect and
precise cancellation on the mass

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:08.206
of the object,
all things fall at the same

00:24:08.206 --> 00:24:10.088
rate;
so I know I need this m

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:13.140
here.
What else do I need?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.639
You notice that from the Third
Law of Newton,

00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:20.934
if there's a force on the
apple, the apple must exert a

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:25.247
similar force on the Earth.
So, if you take an example in

00:24:25.247 --> 00:24:28.816
which here's the Earth and
here's the apple -- there's an

00:24:28.816 --> 00:24:32.384
m sitting there -- but
imagine the apple's getting

00:24:32.384 --> 00:24:35.845
bigger and bigger;
the formula's not going to

00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:38.133
change.
Make it bigger and bigger and

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:41.017
bigger, and bigger,
till it looks like the apple is

00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:43.210
that big and the Earth is that
big.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.809
Then, you will have to agree
that from that point of view you

00:24:47.809 --> 00:24:52.640
should also have the mass of the
Earth here, playing a symmetric

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.788
role.
So, these two masses have to be

00:24:56.788 --> 00:24:59.273
there.
But then what else should I

00:24:59.273 --> 00:25:02.870
have there, what are the other
variables in the problem?

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.588
Yes?
Student: The distance

00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:06.401
from [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:07.299
Shankar: The distance
between them.

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:10.000
And I don't know what the
distance dependence is.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.895
I'm going to say that it's some
function of the distance between

00:25:14.895 --> 00:25:16.960
them.
So, we don't know what the

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.369
distance is.
All right?

00:25:19.369 --> 00:25:22.259
So, let's find the acceleration
of the apple.

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:26.031
That happens to be the mass of
the Earth, this function,

00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:29.940
with r calculated to be
the radius of the Earth.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:40.264
Then, you go to the Moon and
you ask, "What's the

00:25:40.264 --> 00:25:44.593
acceleration of the Moon?"
It's the mass of the Earth

00:25:44.593 --> 00:25:47.158
times the same function,
at the radius of the lunar

00:25:47.158 --> 00:25:47.620
orbit.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.510
Does anybody know how far the
Moon is?

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.330
Any guess?
Do you know how far it is?

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:05.940
Make a wild guess.
Student: A million miles.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.960
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: A million miles.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.900
Not bad, but not quite there.
Any other guess?

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.640
Yes?
Student: 250,000.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.920
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pretty close,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.154
238,000 miles.
So, that's a quarter of a

00:26:18.154 --> 00:26:20.130
million miles.
So, a million's not bad.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.105
Okay?
If you make an estimate that's

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:24.614
off by a factor of Ï,
in physics, it's fine,

00:26:24.614 --> 00:26:27.468
but if you say ten miles or
something then we should have a

00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:30.101
talk;
we should have a very long talk

00:26:30.101 --> 00:26:32.180
after class.
Okay, so that's correct.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.609
So, this guy is 240,000 miles,
just to be simple.

00:26:37.609 --> 00:26:39.150
The radius of the Earth,
how about that?

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.748
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:26:44.748 --> 00:26:47.384
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: How about in good

00:26:47.384 --> 00:26:53.368
old-fashioned miles?
Student: 3 times 10 to

00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:56.929
the 6^(th) miles.
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:58.380
Shankar: 10 to the 6^(th)
would be a million miles.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.380
Student: Oh.
Okay.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.385
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Anybody have a

00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:06.764
quick answer to how many miles?
What's the circumference of the

00:27:06.764 --> 00:27:08.075
Earth?
Students: [inaudible]

00:27:08.075 --> 00:27:09.512
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:27:09.512 --> 00:27:11.380
then you can do the math and
find out the radius.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.670
2Ï is like 6;
so the radius is 4,000 miles.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:23.430
So, this is 4,000 miles and
this is 240,000 miles.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.787
Look, I know that we should
work with meters and kilometers

00:27:26.787 --> 00:27:30.190
but like the rest of you guys,
once I get on the freeway I'm

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.650
watching how many miles per hour
I'm driving,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.885
not meters per second,
because I have no idea what 55

00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:39.213
miles per hour is.
So, we do use a lot of British

00:27:39.213 --> 00:27:41.934
units.
If you go buy insulation at

00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:45.575
Home Depot, it's in BTUs per
slug, per pound,

00:27:45.575 --> 00:27:47.810
or for something,
right?

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.680
So, we still do that.
So, in some sense you wonder

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.039
why you had the War of
Independence if you're still

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:55.706
using those units,
because that's about the worst

00:27:55.706 --> 00:27:58.290
part of the whole system.
But we still use it.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.195
So, my brain is split.
When I do physics,

00:28:01.195 --> 00:28:04.975
I use the metric system.
When I go to Home Depot I use

00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:09.160
the Home Depot units.
All right, so here are the two

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.861
accelerations.
Let's take the ratio of those

00:28:12.861 --> 00:28:16.524
two numbers.
Now, the apple's acceleration,

00:28:16.524 --> 00:28:19.079
all of you guys know,
right?

00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:22.430
It's the one thing we know from
day one: 9.8 meters per second

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.794
squared.
Acceleration of the Moon,

00:28:24.794 --> 00:28:28.695
how am I going to find that?
So, I need an idea on how to

00:28:28.695 --> 00:28:30.940
find the acceleration of the
Moon.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.089
Anybody from this corner of the
room, on the top.

00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:38.360
How do I find the acceleration
of the Moon towards the Earth?

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.330
What will I have to know?
Yes?

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.675
Student: v^(2)/R.
Professor Ramamurti

00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:43.920
Shankar: Very good.
That's all I wanted from you.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.512
We'll fill in the blanks but
it's v^(2)/R,

00:28:47.512 --> 00:28:51.031
and R is this quarter of
a million miles,

00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:54.099
and v is the orbital
velocity.

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.970
You may not know the orbital
velocity of the Moon but you

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.327
know it goes around every 28
days or something,

00:28:59.327 --> 00:29:02.015
right?
So, velocity is 2ÏR/28

00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:03.330
days.
Put it into seconds,

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.099
you get some acceleration.
Yes?

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:07.020
Student: Are you
assuming that the orbit is a

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.662
circle?
Professor Ramamurti

00:29:07.662 --> 00:29:08.654
Shankar: Yes.
Student: Is that why

00:29:08.654 --> 00:29:09.509
it's that way,
v^(2)/R?

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:10.185
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:11.448
exactly.
In fact, if it's not a circle

00:29:11.448 --> 00:29:14.076
it's much more complicated.
So, in this calculation we'll

00:29:14.076 --> 00:29:17.218
assume everything is a circle;
it turns out to be not so bad,

00:29:17.218 --> 00:29:19.334
even for planets.
So, if you do the

00:29:19.334 --> 00:29:22.602
v^(2)/R,
you put the numbers in and you

00:29:22.602 --> 00:29:26.741
find the acceleration of the
apple is 3600 times more than

00:29:26.741 --> 00:29:31.356
the acceleration of the Moon.
On the other hand,

00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:38.990
you find the apple and the Moon
radii are a factor of 60 apart.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.938
In other words,
the Moon is 60 times as far

00:29:40.938 --> 00:29:42.980
from the center of the Earth as
the apple.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.819
And you look at 60,
you look at 3600,

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:48.209
right?
You don't have to be a Newton

00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:52.486
to figure out what's going on;
then you therefore write down

00:29:52.486 --> 00:29:54.140
this great formula.

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:01.152
Do you understand now that the
r^(2)--how you get the

00:30:01.152 --> 00:30:03.714
r^(2)?
Again, it's pretty remarkable

00:30:03.714 --> 00:30:07.700
because this is going to be an
r to the power of 2.001,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.436
and you would certainly not
know you're wrong because these

00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:12.869
numbers are not known that well.
Newton just said,

00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:14.969
look, let me take the nearest
integer power,

00:30:14.969 --> 00:30:17.410
this looks like close enough to
1/r^(2).

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.638
It happens to be 1/r^(2)
is a fantastically good

00:30:20.638 --> 00:30:22.910
approximation to the Law of
Gravity.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.920
So, we were also quite
fortunate there;

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.410
the laws of gravity didn't have
to be that simple.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:33.185
Okay, so now are we done,
or should I do something else

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:34.697
to this?
Student: [inaudible]

00:30:34.697 --> 00:30:35.789
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:38.371
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:41.650
Shankar: This is the force.
I need what else now?

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.550
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.762
Shankar: One of you has to
put your hand up and take a

00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:47.520
stand.
Yes, you have to say something?

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.206
Student: A constant.
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:49.206 --> 00:30:50.030
Shankar: A constant,
right.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.163
Why do you need the constant?
Student: Because if you

00:30:53.163 --> 00:30:56.708
just multiply what you had on
the board, you probably wouldn't

00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:58.530
get exactly the answer.
Professor Ramamurti

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.730
Shankar: Very good.
Yes?

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.254
Student: If you look at
the units, they don't match very

00:31:02.254 --> 00:31:02.949
good.
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:02.949 --> 00:31:03.750
Shankar: The units don't
match, right?

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.070
So, if some kid called,
Isaac comes to you and says,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.349
"I got this new law of
gravitation",

00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:12.280
I would say "Go back and fix
your units."

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.977
The units don't match.
But not only that,

00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:18.380
I think some of you had another
objection, that if you took the

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.398
mass of the Earth and mass of
the Moon and the apple and

00:31:21.398 --> 00:31:24.487
divided by the radius,
you'll get a number that won't

00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:27.809
agree with the force of gravity
near the Earth as we know it.

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:30.189
So the point is,
when a function is proportional

00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:32.062
to all these things,
there is always a

00:31:32.062 --> 00:31:34.973
proportionality constant.
And the constants--One of the

00:31:34.973 --> 00:31:37.761
purposes of a constant is to
make the dimensions come out

00:31:37.761 --> 00:31:39.924
right;
the other is to make the values

00:31:39.924 --> 00:31:42.630
come out right.
Because I got to make sure that

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.388
when I apply it to an apple near
the Earth, I put the mass of the

00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:49.089
apple, and let's say I divide by
the apple.

00:31:49.089 --> 00:31:52.290
This whole thing,
what should it be equal to?

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.357
Student: 9.8.
Professor Ramamurti

00:31:54.357 --> 00:31:55.849
Shankar: It's got to be 9.8,
you understand that?

00:31:55.849 --> 00:31:59.900
The acceleration of the apple,
near the Earth,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.931
has to be 9.8.
If I put the radius of the

00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:07.676
Earth here, this better be 9.8.
So you pick a number g,

00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:12.321
which is some number,
6 times 10 to the minus11 and

00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:17.430
the units for g are some
number times Newton,

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:23.765
m^(2) or kg^(2).
That'll make the units come out

00:32:23.765 --> 00:32:26.429
right.
So that's called a G,

00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:30.445
that's the law of--It's the
universal gravitational

00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:34.348
constant.
I'm almost ready to write down

00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:40.720
now the great Newtonian law.
The great Newtonian law says

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:47.151
F = GmM/r^(2),
where these are two objects of

00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:49.858
mass;
m and M are at a

00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:51.840
distance r from each
other.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.759
But it's not yet a vector;
this is just a number.

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:58.488
So, I want to say that if this
is one mass and here's the other

00:32:58.488 --> 00:33:01.031
mass.
I want to say this one feels a

00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:04.852
force towards the center.
So, let me take the Earth to be

00:33:04.852 --> 00:33:07.380
the center here.
I want the force on the Moon.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.150
I want a vector pointing
towards the center.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.173
So, I know one vector that's
pointing away from the second

00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:15.720
vector, which is the position
vector r.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.653
But if I divide that by the
length of the position vector

00:33:19.653 --> 00:33:23.166
r, I think all of you
know enough vectors to

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:26.609
understand,
this vector has a length 1,

00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:29.529
and points away from the
center.

00:33:29.529 --> 00:33:34.546
But I want it to be pointing
towards the center and that is

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:39.648
then the force of gravity on the
Moon or on the apple or any

00:33:39.648 --> 00:33:42.443
object.
If I'm thinking of one fixed

00:33:42.443 --> 00:33:46.130
object, like the Earth,
this is the force on the apple.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.301
If you're thinking of two
objects of comparable size,

00:33:49.301 --> 00:33:52.839
you'll have to say the force on
one is due to the other.

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:55.299
When you write the formula,
then you've got to make sure

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.670
that the force on one is
pointing to the other one,

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.180
and the force on that guy is
pointing towards this guy.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.150
So, there is no universal
symbol for all those things.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.185
I will write it in the simple
case where we imagine at the

00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:08.374
center some massive object,
like the Sun,

00:34:08.374 --> 00:34:10.950
and something tiny going around
it, and the center of

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.675
coordinates is chosen to be at
the center of the massive

00:34:13.675 --> 00:34:16.181
object.
This is the force on the little

00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:19.059
guy.
This is the Law of Gravity.

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:22.790
It's called the Law of
Universal Gravitation because it

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.469
really is universal.
You got to realize that.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:29.115
It's a tremendous leap of faith
to believe that the laws that

00:34:29.115 --> 00:34:32.760
are operative near the surface
of the Earth also apply to the

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.130
Moon and also apply to the
planets.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.420
This was the year
1600-and-something;

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.409
there was witchcraft and people
had all kinds of superstitions.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:44.150
People were not even thinking
in scientific ways.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.614
There were a lot of illusions
about what the heavens are made

00:34:46.614 --> 00:34:48.328
of.
To believe they're made up of

00:34:48.328 --> 00:34:50.670
similar stuff and controlled by
the same laws,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.687
that's very obvious now but it
was very far from obvious in

00:34:53.687 --> 00:34:57.010
those days.
It's a tremendous leap of faith.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.033
And luckily for us that leap of
faith is justified because the

00:35:00.033 --> 00:35:03.187
laws of gravitation--In fact,
the laws of physics that we

00:35:03.187 --> 00:35:06.481
deduce near the Earth seemed to
work all over the entire

00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:08.695
universe.
If you've seen pictures and

00:35:08.695 --> 00:35:11.132
nova of where we are in the
scheme of things,

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:13.679
we are in a very tiny part of
the universe,

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:18.119
sampling a tiny volume,
over a tiny period of time.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:21.683
But we apply those equations to
the far end of the galaxy,

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:25.247
the far end of the universe,
and going all the way back to

00:35:25.247 --> 00:35:28.761
the Big Bang.
And we predict the future fate

00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:32.103
of the universe.
So, we assume that the laws

00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:35.792
that we discover here,
now, are valid everywhere and

00:35:35.792 --> 00:35:38.323
at all times.
So far that seems to be true,

00:35:38.323 --> 00:35:40.833
and that's a big break for us,
but for that you really

00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:42.995
couldn't do anything.
If the laws you discovered

00:35:42.995 --> 00:35:44.888
today are not valid tomorrow,
you cannot make any

00:35:44.888 --> 00:35:47.546
predictions.
So, it's another unwritten

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:52.156
benefit we got -- unspoken --
it's a great benefit that the

00:35:52.156 --> 00:35:56.233
laws you find are universal.
Somebody had to stick his neck

00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:58.869
out and say, this is one of the
first occasions.

00:35:58.869 --> 00:36:03.446
So now, you are going to apply
this law to understand what

00:36:03.446 --> 00:36:07.073
Kepler did.
Okay, so what do you have to do

00:36:07.073 --> 00:36:11.000
to do what Kepler did?
So, we are going to consider

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.800
the motion of a planet around
the Sun.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.219
So, let's put the Sun here;
let's put the planet here.

00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:18.900
The planet's at the location
r.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.669
You go back,
as usual, to the only equation

00:36:25.669 --> 00:36:28.942
in town: F = ma.
Now F,

00:36:28.942 --> 00:36:33.559
I told you, has to be deduced
every time with painstaking,

00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:36.030
experimental data.
Without that,

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.036
F = ma is useless.
If you don't know what's on the

00:36:39.036 --> 00:36:41.069
left-hand side,
independently--Let me repeat

00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:43.860
again, you don't say the force
on the body is ma.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.587
The force on the body is due to
a spring, due to gravity,

00:36:46.587 --> 00:36:49.087
due to charges -- whatever.
You have to do some work to

00:36:49.087 --> 00:36:50.938
find this;
then, you put it into that

00:36:50.938 --> 00:36:52.889
equation.
But let's put it in here.

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:56.527
The right-hand side of Newton's
law can be written once and for

00:36:56.527 --> 00:36:58.688
all: d^(2)r.
Now, I'm writing

00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:02.110
d^(2)r/dt^(2) because I'm
living in two dimensions.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.062
Now, on the left-hand side,
I have this new result,

00:37:06.062 --> 00:37:09.936
GMm/r^(2) times--I'm
going to use a symbol,

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:13.019
r-hat,
which is very common;

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:16.189
r- anything with a hat on it is
a vector of unit length,

00:37:16.189 --> 00:37:19.590
pointing in the direction of
the regular vector r.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.492
So if you want,
if r is the position

00:37:22.492 --> 00:37:25.809
vector of an object,
whose length is r,

00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:29.521
r-hat is a little guy
whose length is 1,

00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:32.990
and which points in the radial
direction.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:36.368
So, this is your equation.
It's then a problem in

00:37:36.368 --> 00:37:40.661
calculus, to solve the equation,
and everything Kepler said

00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:44.304
should come out of that.
You should find that planets

00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:46.360
like to move in elliptical
orbits.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.900
You should find the areas swept
out as a constant.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.044
You should find the square of a
time period is proportional to

00:37:53.044 --> 00:37:56.870
the cube of the orbit size.
Now, if I give this to you as a

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.929
homework problem in the class,
I dare say it'll be very

00:38:00.929 --> 00:38:04.099
difficult for most of you.
I don't know what kind of

00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:06.365
background you have.
You have done some calculus,

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:08.793
but it's not easy.
But remarkably,

00:38:08.793 --> 00:38:11.989
Newton also solved this
problem.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:15.387
Even now when I teach in
Physics 400-and-something,

00:38:15.387 --> 00:38:18.989
for advanced mechanics,
it takes awhile to know how to

00:38:18.989 --> 00:38:21.763
solve this equation.
It's one thing to write it

00:38:21.763 --> 00:38:24.534
down, another thing to actually
solve it and get the ellipse out

00:38:24.534 --> 00:38:26.870
of it.
So Newton did that too.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.719
So, it's really amazing.
That's why he's such a giant.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:34.884
And you have to step back to
that period in time and ask,

00:38:34.884 --> 00:38:37.822
what did one person accomplish
over a period of what,

00:38:37.822 --> 00:38:41.484
five years?
So, that was how physics is

00:38:41.484 --> 00:38:44.467
always done.
Somebody looks at the data,

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:47.542
sometimes summarizes the data
in the form of certain

00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:50.351
phenomenological facts,
like the laws of Kepler,

00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:53.405
and somebody else has to --
like a theoretical person -- has

00:38:53.405 --> 00:38:56.510
to figure out what are the
underlying rules of this game,

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.207
write it in mathematical form,
and solve the mathematics and

00:39:00.207 --> 00:39:02.738
verify it.
Just imagine that you wrote

00:39:02.738 --> 00:39:05.440
this equation but you couldn't
solve it.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.739
What you would be saying would
actually be correct.

00:39:09.739 --> 00:39:11.615
You, in fact,
have found the correct law of

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:14.071
gravity but you can never be
sure it's right because you

00:39:14.071 --> 00:39:16.260
cannot find the consequence of
your equation.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.180
That is not unheard of.
That's happening in physics

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.298
today.
For example,

00:39:21.298 --> 00:39:24.824
there's the Theory of Quarks.
The quarks are attracted to

00:39:24.824 --> 00:39:27.539
each other by a certain
mechanism we know.

00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:30.606
We know the underlying force
law and from that we're supposed

00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:33.519
to find the--understand the
existence of all particles,

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:35.730
like protons and neutrons and
so on.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:39.953
We do not yet have a way to
show without any doubt that the

00:39:39.953 --> 00:39:44.322
underlying equations imply the
phenomenon that we see when we

00:39:44.322 --> 00:39:47.090
apply it to the problem of
quarks.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.416
By putting it on a big computer
we are fairly certain that's

00:39:50.416 --> 00:39:52.345
correct.
That will be like solving

00:39:52.345 --> 00:39:55.263
Newton's laws on a computer;
but what Newton did was didn't

00:39:55.263 --> 00:39:57.530
solve it on a computer but
solved it analytically.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.064
So quite often,
in the past,

00:39:59.064 --> 00:40:02.417
whenever a theory is accepted,
it's because the consequences

00:40:02.417 --> 00:40:05.429
can be worked out and compared
to the experiment.

00:40:05.429 --> 00:40:08.126
But you could be in a position
where you have the right theory

00:40:08.126 --> 00:40:10.469
and the right equations,
but you cannot solve them.

00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:13.550
Anyway, this one happens to be
solvable.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:17.199
If I change the force law to
1/r to the 2.1,

00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:21.880
then it's a different story.
Anyway, so we want to solve it

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.320
but we cannot do the ellipse;
it's too hard.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.570
So, we are going to do the
circle.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.045
We're going to take the orbit
to be circular,

00:40:30.045 --> 00:40:33.365
and we're going to apply this
force law to that and see what

00:40:33.365 --> 00:40:35.570
we can get.
So, let's do that.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:40.332
We can ask ourselves,
"Can a planet have a circular

00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:45.690
orbit of radius r?"
We go back to F = ma.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.130
Now, you guys are experts on
the right-hand side now.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.869
We're assuming the planet moves
around the circle at constant

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:54.815
velocity, at constant speed.
We want to ask,

00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:58.286
"Can such an orbit exist?"
You're always allowed in an

00:40:58.286 --> 00:41:01.587
equation to make an assumption
and plug it in and see if it

00:41:01.587 --> 00:41:03.378
works.
If the left-hand side and the

00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:04.789
right-hand side match,
you win.

00:41:04.789 --> 00:41:06.820
Nobody will ask you any more
questions.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.650
So, we're asking for a modest
goal.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:14.023
Can I find an orbit of a planet
going around at a constant speed

00:41:14.023 --> 00:41:15.630
around the Sun,
on a circle?

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.310
Let the constant speed be
v, then ma,

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.550
everyone seems to know is
mv^(2)/r.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.389
And it's pointing towards the
center.

00:41:26.389 --> 00:41:30.146
That's should be equal to the
force pointing towards the

00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:33.425
center, and Newton has told us
what the force is:

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:34.860
GMm/r^(2).

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.979
Everybody understand now?
The left-hand side is the

00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:45.960
effect, the right-hand side is
the cause.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.316
If you're spinning a rock,
spinning it in a circle,

00:41:48.316 --> 00:41:51.191
that also has an acceleration
toward the center but the string

00:41:51.191 --> 00:41:53.877
is providing the force and you
can work out the force of a

00:41:53.877 --> 00:41:55.340
string,
of the string.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.836
Here, it's the unseen force of
gravity from the Sun reaching

00:41:58.836 --> 00:42:00.969
out to a planet and pulling it
in.

00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:04.243
And Newton tells you the
formula, deduced from

00:42:04.243 --> 00:42:06.716
terrestrial and lunar
observations,

00:42:06.716 --> 00:42:10.781
now applied to planets.
Okay, so this is something that

00:42:10.781 --> 00:42:14.510
should make you very happy
because this is a very simple

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:19.066
application of F = ma,
but you're describing planetary

00:42:19.066 --> 00:42:22.253
motion now.
So, these are all masses of big

00:42:22.253 --> 00:42:26.145
guys, the Earth and the Sun.
So let's cancel the r,

00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:30.099
and I get--cancel the mass.
That's very interesting.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:37.650
So, that says v^(2)r =
GM.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.539
It says, yes,
you can have a circular orbit

00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:44.185
of any radius you like,
provided you move at the speed

00:42:44.185 --> 00:42:46.180
satisfying this equation.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.615
And as long as you satisfy the
equation, I don't care if the

00:42:51.615 --> 00:42:53.599
thing you're spinning is a
satellite or a potato,

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.730
because the mass of the object
drops out.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.942
So, the condition for orbit is
independent of the object

00:42:58.942 --> 00:43:01.686
orbiting, again,
due to this cancellation of the

00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:05.216
mass on both sides.
All right, so this is all we

00:43:05.216 --> 00:43:09.100
can get out of Newton's laws.
So, let's go back to Kepler.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.510
Is the orbit possible?
Well, if you say an ellipse--a

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.535
circle is a special case of the
ellipse, you have shown circular

00:43:15.535 --> 00:43:19.164
orbits are possible.
How about equal areas in equal

00:43:19.164 --> 00:43:21.081
time?
It's obviously true in this

00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:23.590
problem because it's going at a
constant speed.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.650
If it goes that far in one
week, it'll go that far in one

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.929
week and everyone can tell the
area swept out is constant.

00:43:29.929 --> 00:43:33.709
So, the only thing left to
knock off is a third assumption,

00:43:33.709 --> 00:43:37.880
the third observation of Kepler
involving the time period [T].

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.773
So, I do the simplest thing.
I say, the velocity of this

00:43:41.773 --> 00:43:45.019
planet is 2Ïr divided by
the time period.

00:43:45.019 --> 00:43:53.222
I put that in here and I get
4Ï^(2)r^(3)/t^(2) is

00:43:53.222 --> 00:43:57.754
GM,
or I find r^(3)/T^(2) is

00:43:57.754 --> 00:44:00.170
equal to--well,
let me write

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.512
T^(2)/r^(3),
because that's how Kepler wrote

00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:07.682
it.
This is T^(2) divided by

00:44:07.682 --> 00:44:13.350
r^(3) is equal to
4Ï^(2)/GM.

00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:21.639
So, that's another result you
got right away and that's the

00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:24.671
third result,
that the time period and the

00:44:24.671 --> 00:44:29.108
orbital radius--Here is--What
did Newton do that went further

00:44:29.108 --> 00:44:31.488
than Kepler?
Can you tell me what he did

00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:33.936
that's a little beyond?
Have you guys verified Kepler's

00:44:33.936 --> 00:44:36.090
laws or have you gone a little
beyond that?

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.976
Yes?
Student: Well,

00:44:39.976 --> 00:44:41.661
Kepler says that
T^(2)/a^(3) is always the

00:44:41.661 --> 00:44:43.099
same but he didn't define what
[inaudible]

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:45.030
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Exactly right.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.575
Let me repeat what he said.
Kepler said T^(2)/a^(3)

00:44:48.575 --> 00:44:52.194
is the same thing,
but he didn't tell you what the

00:44:52.194 --> 00:44:55.630
same thing is.
What is the constant?

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.500
Well, now we know that constant
to be 4, known to all of us,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.365
Ï, known to all of us,
M, mass of the Sun and

00:45:04.365 --> 00:45:09.230
G is the universal
constant of gravitation.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:13.669
So, you calculate the value.
A similar thing happened in

00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:16.873
atomic physics.
A high school teacher called

00:45:16.873 --> 00:45:20.909
Balmer was studying the spectral
lines coming out of an atom,

00:45:20.909 --> 00:45:23.782
and they were coming out at
different frequencies,

00:45:23.782 --> 00:45:27.418
and he said all the frequencies
you'd ever see coming out of an

00:45:27.418 --> 00:45:30.760
atom look like some number times
1/1 integer squared,

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.719
times 1 over a different
integer squared.

00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:37.630
He didn't know what the number
was, but it's some constant.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.449
I mean, he knew the number but
he didn't know.

00:45:39.449 --> 00:45:41.510
He knew the number but he
didn't know where it came from.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.079
Then, Bohr had his final theory
of the atom.

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:47.277
It had exactly this form but
this was just not simply a

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:49.816
constant you put in;
it involved Ï and the

00:45:49.816 --> 00:45:52.119
electric charge and Planck's
constant and everything.

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:55.152
So, Balmer did for Bohr what
Kepler did for Newton,

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.064
which is to condense a
complicated data into some

00:45:58.064 --> 00:46:01.340
simple form so that theorists
can have a go at it.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.335
Then once you got the right
answer it's really beautiful how

00:46:04.335 --> 00:46:06.410
everything fits.
We know this is right.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:12.080
Okay, this is called a theory.
By the time physicists will

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.934
call something a theory,
they've put it to a lot of

00:46:14.934 --> 00:46:18.099
tests, okay?
It's not to be casually used.

00:46:18.099 --> 00:46:22.213
And if you have the right
theory, you can make a lot of

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:24.335
predictions.
You can have a theory that

00:46:24.335 --> 00:46:26.325
planets go around the Sun,
because some angels are

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:28.439
flapping their wings.
And I say, "Where are the

00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:29.293
angels?"
And you say,

00:46:29.293 --> 00:46:31.140
"Well, part of the theory is
you don't see them."

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.590
It's very good.
What's your next prediction?

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.989
Tell me when the next eclipse
is.

00:46:35.989 --> 00:46:39.280
Tell me the meteor headed for
Earth is going to hit or miss.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.530
Is this comet going to reappear
or is it a one-shot thing?

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.389
If you cannot answer any of
that, you don't have a theory.

00:46:46.389 --> 00:46:49.530
You have an interpretation of
past data that coincides with

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.390
past data.
That's worth nothing.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.136
Okay?
So, here's an example of how to

00:46:54.136 --> 00:46:59.994
do it right.
Okay, so this thing has got

00:46:59.994 --> 00:47:03.923
enormous power.
It tells you,

00:47:03.923 --> 00:47:08.087
if you find another planet,
you find a new planet tomorrow,

00:47:08.087 --> 00:47:12.179
if you know how far it is,
I'll tell you what a year is in

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:14.664
that planet.
I'll tell you how long the

00:47:14.664 --> 00:47:17.584
planet takes to go around the
Sun, because T^(2)/r^(3)

00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:19.859
is known to me.
So, if that planet is at a

00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:22.550
certain distance,
I can tell you the time period,

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.873
or if I see it going around the
Sun and I know it's going to

00:47:25.873 --> 00:47:28.070
complete the revolution in 240
years,

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:32.336
I can tell you how far it is;
that's another power of the

00:47:32.336 --> 00:47:35.927
theory.
Okay, so now you can do a

00:47:35.927 --> 00:47:40.659
variety of problems using this
formula.

00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:43.180
They're all plug-ins,
but I'll just mention one.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.756
And most problems are like that.
Everything's going to be

00:47:46.756 --> 00:47:50.506
plugging into this formula.
But one interesting example is

00:47:50.506 --> 00:47:52.610
the following.
So, here is the Earth.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:58.989
I'm here and I want to watch a
tennis game being played there.

00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:01.702
I have radio waves,
but you know radio waves cannot

00:48:01.702 --> 00:48:03.917
go through the Earth;
they can only travel in

00:48:03.917 --> 00:48:05.745
straight lines.
And the answer to that,

00:48:05.745 --> 00:48:08.006
I think all of you know,
is to have a bunch of

00:48:08.006 --> 00:48:10.841
satellites,
three of them in particular,

00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:14.723
forming a nice triangle,
and if you can talk to this

00:48:14.723 --> 00:48:17.930
satellite from where you are,
that satellite,

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:21.063
with the help of the other two,
can always see any other point

00:48:21.063 --> 00:48:23.570
you want,
just by bouncing off.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.941
Okay, you bounce off this,
you can go there and you can

00:48:25.941 --> 00:48:28.261
hit this guy.
So, if you have three

00:48:28.261 --> 00:48:32.928
satellites, they can help you
connect any point on the Earth

00:48:32.928 --> 00:48:37.280
to any other point by reflecting
off the satellites.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.742
But the important thing is,
the satellites better be where

00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:42.092
you think they are.
If they're constantly moving

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.773
around, it doesn't work.
So, what you really want is

00:48:44.773 --> 00:48:46.889
what's called geosynchronous
satellites.

00:48:46.889 --> 00:48:50.344
They are satellites--Remember,
if I look at the Earth from the

00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:52.736
top, it is spinning.
This is the North Pole and

00:48:52.736 --> 00:48:55.233
they're spinning.
Therefore, these satellites

00:48:55.233 --> 00:48:58.829
should be rotating around the
Earth once every 24 hours.

00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:01.650
Then, if they're on top of your
head today, they'll be on top of

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.880
your head all the time.
Right?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.091
So, the time period of the
satellite is 24 hours,

00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:12.838
and the only question is at
what altitude should I launch

00:49:12.838 --> 00:49:16.087
them, to go to this formula?
Put in 24 hours,

00:49:16.087 --> 00:49:19.269
write it in seconds,
you will get the radius.

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:23.566
Then, once you got the radius,
this equation will tell you at

00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:26.860
what velocity they should be put
into orbit.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.119
That's it, that's how you put
the geosynchronous satellite.

00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:32.590
That's a simple example of
applying the formula.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:35.920
I won't give other examples.
But they are always going to be

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.004
finding T from r
or finding r from

00:49:39.004 --> 00:49:41.369
T.
Sometimes you'll know r;

00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:43.450
sometimes you will know
T.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:50.679
Any question about this?
Okay.

00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:53.180
Now, I'm going to come to the
question of energy.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.248
Whenever you have a new force
you can talk about the Law of

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:03.729
Conservation of Energy.
So, I want to ask myself,

00:50:03.729 --> 00:50:06.295
what's the potential energy I
can associate with a

00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:08.642
gravitational force?
I can ask myself,

00:50:08.642 --> 00:50:10.860
is it even a conservative
force?

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.610
So, let's take the problem in
two stages.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:16.595
First of all,
if you're near the Earth,

00:50:16.595 --> 00:50:19.659
everything falls down near the
Earth.

00:50:19.659 --> 00:50:24.364
If that height is y,
then the force of gravity is

00:50:24.364 --> 00:50:29.068
-mg times J,
but J is a unit vector

00:50:29.068 --> 00:50:32.538
in that direction;
the potential energy is then

00:50:32.538 --> 00:50:34.579
mgy and everybody can
check.

00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:37.336
If you take the -y
derivative of this,

00:50:37.336 --> 00:50:40.079
you get the force.
That's the potential energy.

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:43.757
And therefore,
when a body is falling near the

00:50:43.757 --> 00:50:48.007
surface of the Earth,
we may assert that Â½ mv^(2)

00:50:48.007 --> 00:50:50.696
+ mg,
let me call it height instead

00:50:50.696 --> 00:50:54.006
of y, let me call this
coordinate h instead of

00:50:54.006 --> 00:50:56.145
y;
I don't think it matters too

00:50:56.145 --> 00:50:59.207
much.
That is the total energy and

00:50:59.207 --> 00:51:03.076
that is a constant.
We applied it the other day to

00:51:03.076 --> 00:51:05.236
roller coasters,
going up and down,

00:51:05.236 --> 00:51:08.466
speeding up and slowing down.
It's just that this number will

00:51:08.466 --> 00:51:10.972
not change.
As the roller coaster changes

00:51:10.972 --> 00:51:14.704
the height, the speed must
change, keeping this number

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:17.918
constant.
But you know this formula is an

00:51:17.918 --> 00:51:24.269
approximation near the Earth.
You want to apply it globally.

00:51:24.269 --> 00:51:28.947
Before going to the global
problem, let me remember one

00:51:28.947 --> 00:51:33.712
more thing, that g =
GM/R_E^(2) because

00:51:33.712 --> 00:51:38.909
when you apply Newton's law to
the surface of the Earth,

00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:42.512
you better get this number
g, when you apply it to

00:51:42.512 --> 00:51:46.172
something near the Earth.
By the way, Newton took a long

00:51:46.172 --> 00:51:48.800
time to publish this Law of
Gravitation.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.960
Does anybody know why he was
holding back for a long time?

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.630
Have you heard of anything?
Yes?

00:51:55.630 --> 00:52:00.105
Student: Newton was in
the controversy over the

00:52:00.105 --> 00:52:04.919
discovery of the [inaudible]
and then I think Edmond Haley

00:52:04.919 --> 00:52:08.076
convinced him later on.
Professor Ramamurti

00:52:08.076 --> 00:52:09.950
Shankar: Ah,
Edmond Haley may have convinced

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:11.863
him to publish but it was
something else that was

00:52:11.863 --> 00:52:13.869
bothering Newton.
Yes?

00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:15.750
Student: He was afraid
of criticism.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.673
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: He's afraid of

00:52:16.673 --> 00:52:20.401
criticism.
Maybe but that was not why he

00:52:20.401 --> 00:52:22.579
held back.
Yes?

00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:24.079
Student: Didn't he also
doubt it very much?

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:24.590
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:28.340
Student: Didn't he also
doubt that it was possible.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.114
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:52:29.114 --> 00:52:29.989
but look, when he applied
it--By the way,

00:52:29.989 --> 00:52:32.239
he applied it to everything,
celestial motion,

00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:34.940
to the behavior of tides,
everything seemed to work.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.909
There is one further assumption
that you make.

00:52:37.909 --> 00:52:41.090
When I wrote
1/R^(2)_E,

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:45.820
I said the distance of the
apple from the Earth is that.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.762
But maybe it should be just the
two meters from which I release

00:52:48.762 --> 00:52:50.727
it.
Somehow he knew you have to

00:52:50.727 --> 00:52:53.989
measure the distance from the
center of the Earth.

00:52:53.989 --> 00:53:00.340
So, it is not clear for the
purposes of gravitation.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.174
In other words,
originally Newton had a law of

00:53:03.174 --> 00:53:06.889
gravitation between two point
objects, namely point-like.

00:53:06.889 --> 00:53:09.702
The distance between them is
unambiguously the distance

00:53:09.702 --> 00:53:11.889
between the points,
and he got this law.

00:53:11.889 --> 00:53:15.538
But in the end,
he wants to apply it to the

00:53:15.538 --> 00:53:18.800
Earth and the apple;
they are close enough for you.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.731
You cannot pretend the Earth
looks like a point from where I

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:23.450
am.
It looks like a big, fat thing.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.567
You cannot say it's point-like.
So, what you really should do

00:53:26.567 --> 00:53:29.588
is divide the Earth into tiny
pieces, each one of which is

00:53:29.588 --> 00:53:32.467
point-like,
find the force on each from

00:53:32.467 --> 00:53:35.554
each chunk of the Earth,
using this law,

00:53:35.554 --> 00:53:37.994
and add it up.
And if you're lucky,

00:53:37.994 --> 00:53:41.388
it will look as if all the pull
is coming from one point at the

00:53:41.388 --> 00:53:44.070
center, carrying the entire mass
of the Earth.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.539
So, what branch of mathematics
do you have to use to get that

00:53:48.539 --> 00:53:50.119
result?
Yes?

00:53:50.119 --> 00:53:52.602
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:53:52.602 --> 00:53:54.730
Shankar: What branch of
mathematics?

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:58.477
What kind of calculus?
Students: [inaudible]

00:53:58.477 --> 00:53:59.312
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Had it been

00:53:59.312 --> 00:54:01.250
invented?
No.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:04.630
So, he had to then invent
integral calculus also.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:08.059
So, if he felt that no one
around him was doing any work,

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:11.304
it was probably justified
because they just dumped the

00:54:11.304 --> 00:54:13.570
whole thing on this kid and
said,

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:16.521
why don't you do Integral--?
That's why it took him a long

00:54:16.521 --> 00:54:18.489
time to verify,
using integrals,

00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:22.489
that the sphere behaves like a
point particle at the center.

00:54:22.489 --> 00:54:25.387
He knew it works because all
these numbers couldn't be all

00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:27.369
the coincidences or not
coincidences.

00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:30.471
He believed it worked but he
had not found a way to show it,

00:54:30.471 --> 00:54:32.679
and that's what held back a
publication.

00:54:32.679 --> 00:54:34.699
Okay, that's another rare
behavior.

00:54:34.699 --> 00:54:37.499
Okay, anyway,
I come to this problem and I

00:54:37.499 --> 00:54:41.869
say I want to apply it not near
the Earth but arbitrarily far.

00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:45.694
Near the Earth the force is
-mg, but far from the

00:54:45.694 --> 00:54:50.518
Earth, many, many miles away,
the force is really what we

00:54:50.518 --> 00:54:55.360
wrote here, is -GMm/r^(2)
times r,

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.360
unit vector in the radial
direction.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.998
The first thing you can check
is that this is actually a

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:06.460
conservative force.
I'm going to give this to you.

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.429
I don't have time to do that.
In other words,

00:55:08.429 --> 00:55:11.828
write this r-hat if you
like, with an r divided

00:55:11.828 --> 00:55:14.829
by one more r on the
bottom, we don't care.

00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:22.470
And that can be returned as
-GMm times I times

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:27.910
x/r^(3) + J times
y/r^(3).

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:31.829
Right?
I just wrote the vector

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.550
r in terms of x
and y.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:36.720
So the x component of this
force is x/r^(3);

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.482
the y is y/r^(3).
r is just square root of x^(2)

00:55:40.482 --> 00:55:42.958
+ y^(2).
So maybe you can tell me,

00:55:42.958 --> 00:55:47.250
what should I do to check that
this is a conservative force?

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:53.006
Student: Use that
formula and [inaudible]

00:55:53.006 --> 00:55:58.150
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:00.619
I will repeat what he said;
that's the correct answer.

00:56:00.619 --> 00:56:03.207
I must take the x
component of this,

00:56:03.207 --> 00:56:05.610
take the y partial
derivative,

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.865
the y component of this,
take an x partial

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:09.739
derivatives.
You guys should do that.

00:56:09.739 --> 00:56:12.892
When you take the derivative of
something like 1/r^(3),

00:56:12.892 --> 00:56:15.321
you should first take the
r derivative of

00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:17.239
r^(3),
and then take the x

00:56:17.239 --> 00:56:19.280
derivative of r or the
y derivative.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.481
Using the Chain Rule of
calculus, you'll find the two

00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.400
agree.
So, we know it's conservative.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.011
That's the power of the result.
So, all you have to do is guess

00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:29.670
what potential could have led to
this force.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:33.340
So I say, okay,
let's put the Sun here.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.469
Let me move along the x
axis.

00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:38.486
The force, along the x
axis, looks like

00:56:38.486 --> 00:56:41.905
-GMm/x^(2) because
x is just r,

00:56:41.905 --> 00:56:44.519
if you're moving in this
direction.

00:56:44.519 --> 00:56:46.840
In the other direction that's
r, but let me just move

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.933
along the x direction.
I ask myself,

00:56:48.933 --> 00:56:52.965
what function has a property
that minus a derivative of that,

00:56:52.965 --> 00:56:55.989
with respect to x,
looks like this?

00:56:55.989 --> 00:56:59.080
That's a Mickey-Mouse calculus
problem.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.710
It's just -1/x.
Okay?

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.219
Minus the derivative of
-1/x is -1/x^(2).

00:57:05.219 --> 00:57:08.860
Therefore, x is
r, in general.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:12.350
The U that you want for
gravitation looks like this.

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:20.773
So, gravitational potential
energy for problems arbitrarily

00:57:20.773 --> 00:57:23.630
far from the center of this
mass,

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:26.210
not near just the surface of
the Earth but wherever you go,

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.480
in any gravitational problem,
this is U.

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:34.185
You can check but if you took
this U,

00:57:34.185 --> 00:57:36.070
here's what I'm telling you
guys to do.

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:37.809
If you're really--.
Did I miss something?

00:57:37.809 --> 00:57:39.940
Student: Shouldn't that
be positive?

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.780
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No.

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.630
Let's see.
If you took the r

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.630
derivative of this,
1/r is r to the

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.692
-1;
the derivative of that will

00:57:52.692 --> 00:57:55.858
make it +1/r^(2).
But you're really supposed to

00:57:55.858 --> 00:57:58.170
take minus the derivative of
U;

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:02.397
and that'll be the right thing.
So, this is the potential

00:58:02.397 --> 00:58:08.699
energy, which will be negative.
So, what am I claiming?

00:58:08.699 --> 00:58:11.441
I'm claiming that if you got
the Sun and you got some other

00:58:11.441 --> 00:58:15.967
planet moving around it,
the following quantity will not

00:58:15.967 --> 00:58:22.030
change, which is Â½ mv^(2) -
GmM/r is a constant.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.500
Now, take an object moving near
the Earth.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.010
I gave you a different rule.
I said near the Earth.

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:45.671
What did I say the rule was?
The constant is Â½ mv^(2) +

00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:49.360
mgh.
Kinetic energy looks right;

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.519
potential energy looks really
wrong.

00:58:51.519 --> 00:58:54.800
There seem to be two
definitions of potential energy.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.370
They don't even agree in sign.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.795
So, what's going on?
What's the way out of this

00:59:04.795 --> 00:59:07.579
problem I'm in?
Do you have any idea?

00:59:07.579 --> 00:59:12.400
Student: You have to
have g by some vector.

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.713
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: G,

00:59:13.713 --> 00:59:15.351
you mean, or g?
Student: [inaudible]

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:16.647
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:59:16.647 --> 00:59:18.630
that's not a bad idea.
Suppose I do that.

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.752
That's a very good idea.
So, let me write that as

00:59:21.752 --> 00:59:25.768
GMm over
R^(2)_E times

00:59:25.768 --> 00:59:28.860
h.
That's a good plan.

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:32.345
But you notice this cannot
possibly equal that because

00:59:32.345 --> 00:59:33.990
that's negative,
right?

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.980
This is positive.

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:41.730
Any way to reconcile these?
Yes?

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:44.263
Student: Well,
differences because the first

00:59:44.263 --> 00:59:47.303
one is for different values of
force, while the second one is

00:59:47.303 --> 00:59:48.840
assuming a constant.
Professor Ramamurti

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.656
Shankar: I agree.
But no, the constant is

00:59:50.656 --> 00:59:54.299
certainly--It's true that near
the Earth we treat it as a

00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:56.791
constant.
But if I took the formula value

00:59:56.791 --> 00:59:59.716
for every distance and I
specialized it to the problem

00:59:59.716 --> 01:00:02.274
near the Earth,
it's got to agree with the

01:00:02.274 --> 01:00:04.139
problem near the Earth,
right?

01:00:04.139 --> 01:00:07.118
The bigger formula should
embrace or enclose a smaller

01:00:07.118 --> 01:00:10.618
formula.
Student: Maybe we should

01:00:10.618 --> 01:00:14.219
say the radii equal to the first
one.

01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:14.728
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:16.016
I will do that.
In other words,

01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:19.999
I grant you I'm willing to put
R_E here,

01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:21.663
right?
But there is no way this

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:24.222
expression and this can match
because they're not even of the

01:00:24.222 --> 01:00:25.952
right sign.
You don't even have to think

01:00:25.952 --> 01:00:28.907
more than that.
They cannot be right as they

01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:30.840
are.
Yes?

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.276
Student: Maybe try to
explain h in terms of

01:00:35.276 --> 01:00:36.599
radii.
Like the difference in

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:37.634
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.920
Shankar: No,
h is the number of

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.329
meters above the ground.
You put the number in.

01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:44.943
Look, most of your escape
routes don't work because you're

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:48.810
trying to get a positive number
to equal a negative number.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.267
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:57.559
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Thank you.

01:00:57.559 --> 01:01:00.487
I didn't know I was going home
for lunch, because I was not

01:01:00.487 --> 01:01:02.909
going to proceed until I got the
right answer.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.057
The right answer is,
when you define a potential,

01:01:06.057 --> 01:01:09.729
there is a freedom to add a
constant to the definition of

01:01:09.729 --> 01:01:12.107
the potential.
If you look at every theorem,

01:01:12.107 --> 01:01:14.255
everything I derived,
including the stuff I've hidden

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:15.897
under the board,
U_1 -

01:01:15.897 --> 01:01:18.039
U_2 is what enters
everywhere;

01:01:18.039 --> 01:01:19.659
the change in kinetic energy is
U_1 -

01:01:19.659 --> 01:01:22.536
U_2.
Therefore, one has a freedom in

01:01:22.536 --> 01:01:26.969
defining the potential to add a
constant, and what has happened

01:01:26.969 --> 01:01:31.260
is that the person working with
this potential and the person

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.550
working with this potential have
not taken the same reference

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:38.464
point.
This person working near the

01:01:38.464 --> 01:01:42.504
Earth said, let me choose for
convenience the potential at

01:01:42.504 --> 01:01:46.099
height equal to 0 to be 0,
because that's a natural point

01:01:46.099 --> 01:01:50.500
for me.
What about this person here?

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.159
Yes?
Student: Potential is 0.

01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:54.174
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: He's saying

01:01:54.174 --> 01:01:56.408
potential is 0 at infinity
because when you're doing

01:01:56.408 --> 01:01:58.331
celestial mechanics,
here's one object,

01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:01.043
other objects of various
distances, infinity is rather an

01:02:01.043 --> 01:02:03.548
interesting point.
You go infinitely far from it,

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:06.480
no potential energy.
So, the two of them differ by a

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.610
constant.
That's the reason why.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:12.556
And the constant can easily
overturn a quantity that's

01:02:12.556 --> 01:02:15.170
negative, and bring it up to
positive values.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:19.507
So, except for that constant,
once I add a certain constant,

01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:22.981
everything should work out.
So, I will show you that it

01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:24.140
does.
Okay?

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:28.496
Then, everything will be fine.
Maybe there are two ways to do

01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:30.416
it;
I'm on two minds on how to show

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:32.829
the two ways.
I'll try one method.

01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:38.151
Let's take the answer that's
valid for all distances,

01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:41.060
right?
That's the celestial formula.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.478
Forget all the constants.
It looks like -1/r,

01:02:44.478 --> 01:02:47.261
do you agree?
Some blah-blah-blah constant,

01:02:47.261 --> 01:02:49.871
divided by r.
So, it's a graph that looks

01:02:49.871 --> 01:02:52.266
like this.
It blows up to minus infinity

01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:55.647
when r goes to 0,
and it goes to 0 when r

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:58.606
goes to infinity.
This is the formula for

01:02:58.606 --> 01:03:02.909
U, for a person who says
U = 0 at infinity.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.916
Now, let's look at the formula,
in the neighborhood of the

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:07.130
surface of the Earth.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.880
Here is where we are most of
the time.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:21.428
So, if I shift my 0 to here,
then by design,

01:03:21.428 --> 01:03:27.179
I've made U to be 0 on
the surface of the Earth.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:30.344
Then, let me also measure the
new coordinate this way,

01:03:30.344 --> 01:03:32.971
called h,
which is the radial distance

01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:35.300
away from the
R_E.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.800
This is R_E,
this is R_E +

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.240
h.
Then, I blow up this box.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.681
What do you find?
I blow up the box with my newly

01:03:44.681 --> 01:03:46.656
shifted origin.
Here is h,

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:50.299
and here is the potential
energy, looking like a straight

01:03:50.299 --> 01:03:52.670
line.
And if you're lucky,

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:57.019
the slope of the straight line
should be what?

01:03:57.019 --> 01:04:00.380
What should be the slope,
so we can reconcile everything?

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.070
If a function is a straight
line, it has a certain slope.

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.456
What's the y coordinate,
slope times the x

01:04:10.456 --> 01:04:11.780
coordinate.
Yes?

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.619
Student: g
Professor Ramamurti

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:14.570
Shankar: Not g.
Yes?

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.725
Student: mg
Professor Ramamurti

01:04:15.725 --> 01:04:17.368
Shankar: mg.
If it's mg,

01:04:17.368 --> 01:04:20.110
if that's a slope,
mg times h would

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.820
be the function you are drawing.
Right?

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.400
So, that's all I have to show
you.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.658
And I will show that that's
what happens,

01:04:26.658 --> 01:04:29.353
and then we are set.
So, let's take the master

01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:31.330
formula for the potential
energy;

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:38.219
write it as GMm.
Let's apply it to a distance;

01:04:38.219 --> 01:04:42.530
near the Earth it's r +
h.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.130
That's what we're trying to do,
right?

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:54.208
Now, so, you must solve that
expression as -GMm over

01:04:54.208 --> 01:05:01.493
r times (1 + h/r).
That is just a rewriting of

01:05:01.493 --> 01:05:04.486
this.
And you can write that--I'm

01:05:04.486 --> 01:05:07.364
sorry, I apologize.
Do you know what's wrong with

01:05:07.364 --> 01:05:09.340
what I wrote?
This is not r + h.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.960
What should I be really putting
here?

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.740
[Replaces all small "r"s in the
paragraph above with

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.491
R_E]
Students: [inaudible]

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:13.226
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Radius of the

01:05:13.226 --> 01:05:14.747
Earth.
So, I don't know how you're

01:05:14.747 --> 01:05:17.670
going to correct it in your
notes, but this really should be

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.698
radius of the Earth.
Everywhere, here,

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:22.470
I want to be at a height
h, above the radius of

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:24.460
the Earth.
So, I put that here.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:34.807
Then, I write this as
-GMm/R_E)(1 +

01:05:34.807 --> 01:05:43.413
h/R_E )^(-1).
I just bring the downstairs to

01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:46.190
the upstairs.
Then, remember the wonderful

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:49.184
formula I told you?
You guys have to know this:

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:51.593
(1 + x)^(n);
it is approximately 1 +

01:05:51.593 --> 01:05:54.210
nx, if x is very
small;

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:56.332
x is here,
the height over the radius of

01:05:56.332 --> 01:05:58.039
the Earth, which is obviously
tiny,

01:05:58.039 --> 01:06:04.528
so I can approximate that and I
get U =

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:14.023
-GMm/R_E times 1 +
GMm/R^(2)_E

01:06:14.023 --> 01:06:17.030
times h.

01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:26.963
This is the potential energy at
the surface of the Earth for a

01:06:26.963 --> 01:06:31.774
guy who thinks of zero infinity.
This is the change in potential

01:06:31.774 --> 01:06:34.539
energy, when you move a distance
h.

01:06:34.539 --> 01:06:37.988
Therefore, if you calculate
U of h,

01:06:37.988 --> 01:06:41.150
-U of 0,
you will cancel that term;

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:46.506
then, you will get the same
answer as the person using this

01:06:46.506 --> 01:06:49.054
formula.
So, that's very important to

01:06:49.054 --> 01:06:52.070
understand how these two are
saying the same thing.

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:56.382
It is best understood in terms
of the graph that I've drawn for

01:06:56.382 --> 01:06:59.489
you.
You shift your origin to one

01:06:59.489 --> 01:07:05.059
place and you also shift the
zero potential to one place.

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:11.600
Now, for a circular orbit,
what's the energy?

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:20.699
It's Â½ mv^(2) - GMm/r.
But we know that Â½

01:07:20.699 --> 01:07:27.452
mv^(2) is v^(2) is
mv^(2) is a centrifugal

01:07:27.452 --> 01:07:31.699
force, I mean the centripetal
force.

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:38.602
So therefore,
you can write that as GMm/r

01:07:38.602 --> 01:07:42.792
- GMm/r;
you find the answer is then

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.309
minus the potential energy over
2.

01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:49.830
Oh, I'm sorry--potential energy
over 2, or minus the kinetic

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.450
energy.
In other words,

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:55.360
if you combine these two terms,
you get -GMm/2r.

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:03.070
So, for a particle in a
circular orbit,

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.955
the kinetic energy is exactly
half the magnitude of the

01:08:05.955 --> 01:08:08.840
potential energy and the total
energy is negative.

01:08:13.449 --> 01:08:17.479
Okay, so I want to close with
one very important result.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.350
So, whenever you see a
celestial body -- here's the Sun

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.743
-- you see some celestial thing
moving around,

01:08:22.743 --> 01:08:24.710
you can compute the total
energy.

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:29.708
If the total energy is
negative, that object is bound

01:08:29.708 --> 01:08:33.982
to go on orbiting the Sun.
It can never escape the

01:08:33.982 --> 01:08:36.658
infinity.
If the total energy is

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:43.159
positive, it can go to infinity.
And zero is the borderline case.

01:08:43.159 --> 01:08:45.374
So, why is it that if the total
energy is negative,

01:08:45.374 --> 01:08:47.190
the body can never run off to
infinity?

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:53.185
Can anyone think of a
contradiction you would have,

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:56.160
if a body of negative energy
found itself at infinity?

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.382
Yes?
Student: It doesn't have

01:08:58.382 --> 01:09:00.902
to be gaining energy to go to
infinity, [inaudible]

01:09:00.902 --> 01:09:03.020
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.290
at infinity the potential
energy is zero.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:09.550
What about kinetic energy?
Some positive number, right?

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:12.758
But its initial energy was
negative, and you cannot change

01:09:12.758 --> 01:09:14.720
it.
So if you got total negative

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.020
energy, you cannot be found
wandering around infinity,

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.996
because at infinity if you're
moving around,

01:09:19.996 --> 01:09:21.560
you got positive kinetic
energy,

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.775
no potential energy,
and the energy that was

01:09:23.775 --> 01:09:26.144
originally negative,
you have no business being

01:09:26.144 --> 01:09:28.409
there.
So, objects with negative

01:09:28.409 --> 01:09:31.370
energy will never escape.
So, if you saw a comet,

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.247
you want to know if it'll come
back again, find the kinetic

01:09:34.247 --> 01:09:35.898
plus potential.
If it's positive,

01:09:35.898 --> 01:09:38.550
it won't come back;
if it's negative it's trapped.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.717
That's the dividing line.
So, if you're near the Earth

01:09:41.717 --> 01:09:44.682
and you want to shoot something,
you can pick it in any

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:47.138
direction you want.
Suppose you start shooting them

01:09:47.138 --> 01:09:48.646
up.
They go to different heights,

01:09:48.646 --> 01:09:50.689
and one day you don't want it
to come back.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:53.588
You can ask yourself,
"How fast should I fire a gun

01:09:53.588 --> 01:09:57.145
so the bullet never comes back?"
Well, you should fire it so

01:09:57.145 --> 01:10:00.547
that it can go to infinity.
When it goes to infinity,

01:10:00.547 --> 01:10:03.220
you want to just manage to get
there;

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.289
it's going to go to infinity,
stagger, and fall down.

01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:07.363
Well, it's got no kinetic
energy in infinity,

01:10:07.363 --> 01:10:09.390
it's got no potential energy in
infinity.

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:12.090
Therefore, its total energy
should be 0.

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:17.754
Therefore, what you should
do--At the surface of the Earth

01:10:17.754 --> 01:10:22.723
your Â½ mv^(2) -
GMm/R_E should be

01:10:22.723 --> 01:10:25.063
0,
or these two numbers should be

01:10:25.063 --> 01:10:29.386
equal;
or canceling the mass you will

01:10:29.386 --> 01:10:34.738
find some formula,
which is v^(2) = GM/

01:10:34.738 --> 01:10:38.628
R_E.
So, depending on the mass of

01:10:38.628 --> 01:10:40.924
the Earth and gravitational
constant radius of the Earth,

01:10:40.924 --> 01:10:43.234
you'll get a velocity.
That's called "the escape

01:10:43.234 --> 01:10:45.486
velocity."
When something is fired with

01:10:45.486 --> 01:10:48.197
escape velocity,
it will just about make it to

01:10:48.197 --> 01:10:50.191
infinity.
You want to be really sure it

01:10:50.191 --> 01:10:52.340
doesn't come back,
give it a little extra speed.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.112
A little less,
it'll orbit the Earth,

01:10:55.112 --> 01:10:58.976
it just won't go away.
All right, so I want you to

01:10:58.976 --> 01:11:03.680
think about what you've learned
because you can now go ahead and

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.444
read articles.
For example,

01:11:05.444 --> 01:11:07.884
you heard about dark matter?
I'll just tell you one sentence

01:11:07.884 --> 01:11:09.689
about dark--Anybody heard about
dark matter?

01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:12.843
Okay, most of the universe
seems to be made out of stuff we

01:11:12.843 --> 01:11:14.350
cannot see.
Okay, you, me,

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:17.439
we don't add up to anything,
a very small percentage.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.229
How do people know there is
dark matter?

01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:21.520
You cannot see it but you know
it's there.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.188
How do you know it's there?
You know it's there because our

01:11:25.188 --> 01:11:28.862
galaxy or any galaxy has got
matter you see and matter you

01:11:28.862 --> 01:11:31.503
don't see.
If you draw an orbit around the

01:11:31.503 --> 01:11:35.052
galaxy, going all the way around
the galaxy, you can treat the

01:11:35.052 --> 01:11:37.380
entire mass as sitting at the
center.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.008
Then you can use your
gravitational formula,

01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:42.270
v^(2)r as the enclosed
mass.

01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:44.998
If you go further out,
you should find you're not

01:11:44.998 --> 01:11:48.579
enclosing any more mass because
the mass is all what you see.

01:11:48.579 --> 01:11:51.269
But what we find is,
as the orbit gets bigger in the

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:53.590
galaxy, v^(2)r keeps on
increasing;

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:56.618
so the mass enclosed is
increasing, but you don't see

01:11:56.618 --> 01:11:58.557
it.
That's how you know there is

01:11:58.557 --> 01:12:01.500
mass which is not visible to
visible observation.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.939
But every galaxy seems to have
this halo of dark matter.

01:12:06.939 --> 01:12:10.007
And that's how we estimate the
mass and it beats all the known

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:12.635
mass.
But you can do that using just

01:12:12.635 --> 01:12:13.835
this calculation.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.961
Prof: How many of you
saw The New York Times

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:06.140
yesterday morning?
 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.000
What did you see?
 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.035
Student:  The girls who
had been splashed with acid by

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.390
the Taliban on the way to
school.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:33.118
Prof: Yes,
so the front and center story

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:49.530
in The Times is--let me
get my pointer.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.595
So this girl--so in Afghanistan
one of the ways of suppressing

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:58.830
women is to keep them from
getting any education.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.908
When these girls go to
school--because,

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:05.185
you'll learn a lot about that
in the course of why they want

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:08.239
to go to school and why their
parents want them to go to

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.849
school.
 

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.920
They go to school and three
guys came up on a motorcycle--

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.129
a motor scooter and they just
ask the girls,

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:18.331
"Are you going to
school?"

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.393
They're walking to school in
the morning, and the girls said,

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:21.080
"Yes."
 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.114
Threw acid in their faces,
and this story is about that

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:30.870
kind of thing happening right
now in Afghanistan.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.030
When this happened,
the girl--everybody was of

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.700
course very scared but the
parents--

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.910
one set of parents that were
quoted here said,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.190
"You must go to school
even if you're killed."

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.759
That going to school is more
important than their lives in

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.410
these communities and you'll
understand a lot later why.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.739
Now one other notable thing
happened--so that's quite

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:56.379
amazing.
 

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.316
I talked about it on Tuesday
and Wednesday morning up comes

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.040
The New York Times story.
 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.390
This happens every year.
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.379
I think there's a spy in the
class.

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.736
The next thing is a student
said she loved the lecture,

00:02:08.736 --> 00:02:10.788
but what did she love about it?
 

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:15.613
She loved the dung beetles,
and so she sent me her own

00:02:15.613 --> 00:02:19.069
personal picture of dung
beetles, here,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.530
and she waxed a little bit
poetic about them.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.228
"I have to let you know
that dung beetles are among my

00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:28.438
favorite animals.
 

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:32.604
The best part is watching the
males agonize over rolling the

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:36.276
ball over to the hole while the
female rides relaxed,

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:38.889
just planting her eggs inside
it.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.190
The ultimate feminism,
if you ask me."

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.364
Now the student wants to remain
anonymous, so that you all don't

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:50.650
think that she's a little kinky
maybe;

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.470
nothing wrong with that.
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.560
This is--we're very liberal
minded here in this class.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.818
Now how many of you were not
here last time?

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.764
A few of you,
so I should give a very short

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:07.288
summary of what went on last
time.

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:11.455
I was describing the basic
biology of how the social

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:16.355
organization of the species is
organized around their sex and

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:18.479
reproductive function.
 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.915
For virtually all species of
higher then single cell

00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:27.352
organisms, the female puts a lot
of--makes big eggs,

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:31.460
a lot of investment;
she doesn't make that many eggs.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.669
They're rare and expensive.
 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.991
The male sperm is very tiny;
he can make a huge amount of

00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:45.250
them, and so they are plentiful
and very cheap.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.233
Males then, given the excess of
sperm, that males can inseminate

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:51.419
many females.
 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.818
The males then must compete for
the females,

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:59.226
and they have two mechanisms,
either sperm competition where

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:02.516
the sexual system is polygamous,
promiscuous,

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:05.169
and many males will mate with
the same female;

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.848
the same female will mate with
many males,

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:13.133
and then the sperms themselves
will compete by a whole variety

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:18.160
of mechanisms to see which sperm
will fertilize the egg.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.552
The other male strategy is to
physically fight with other

00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:26.944
males to gain control of the
female or to compete in some

00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:31.163
other way like displaying your--
the peacock with this enormous

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:34.004
tail displaying,
'I've got a more beautiful tail

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:37.110
than you do,' or we talked about
birds dancing.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.615
The males dance for a long time
and display their mental ability

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.690
to dance coordinatedly and their
beauty and stamina to the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.550
females.
 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.649
Then the females choose.
 

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.670
The females also have two
strategies.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.819
Obviously this is a great
simplification.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.749
The females also have two
strategies, one is to get

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.600
resources from the male,
as in the dung beetle.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.759
The dung balls are full of
nitrogen which is very rare,

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.500
and so they feed this to the
female,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.459
and the female then can produce
more eggs in it,

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.225
which is evolutionarily very
good for both the male and the

00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:18.810
female.
 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.310
Or the female wants to choose
the male with the best genes;

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.742
in some ways the males have to
display what are the best genes,

00:05:27.742 --> 00:05:31.230
and best just means those that
are successful reproductively.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.079
Sometimes bigger is better;
sometimes smaller is better;

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.019
sometimes fast is better;
sometimes slow is better;

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.211
better does not mean anything
and fitness--the word fitness,

00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.754
which you've heard,
does not mean anything other

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:44.540
than 'leaves more offspring.'
 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.110
It can be any kind of phenotype
you can imagine,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.738
any kind of body type,
any kind of ability or the

00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:50.449
opposite.
 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.935
In some ecological situations
being fat is good,

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:58.660
and other times being skinny is
good.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.168
The females either watch the
male's display,

00:06:02.168 --> 00:06:06.654
watch the peacock's tail,
or observe the end of fighting

00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:10.769
between the males;
that one male becomes dominant

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.870
then the female is happy to
copulate with that male.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.706
When males fight,
the males tend to get large

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:20.220
because that helps them in the
fight.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.495
Evolution makes them larger,
and they get larger than the

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:26.360
females, and once they're larger
than the females,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.699
they can start coercing the
females.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.855
And that's really the origin
of--the biological origin of--a

00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:34.970
lot of male/female violence.
 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.750
Males can either--to gain
access to female--

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.548
they can either fight with
other males which can be very

00:06:40.548 --> 00:06:43.399
difficult and you're liable to
get damaged or killed,

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:47.209
or just coerce a female who's
smaller and less strong,

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.180
and so you get male coercion of
females.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.339
In primates,
it's the last sort of--

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.160
in primates and the great
apes--we are all great apes--

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.069
in particular,
this tendency toward male

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.980
violence onto females is carried
to--

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.819
is most prominent.
 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.723
The reason is,
we invest enormously in our

00:07:13.723 --> 00:07:14.290
young.
 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.841
We spend a very long time with
the young, taking care of them,

00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:20.403
and therefore,
the females who do most of the

00:07:20.403 --> 00:07:22.850
investment can't have very many
young;

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.629
they can't have them very
rapidly.

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:26.987
In the great apes,
aside from humans,

00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:30.129
which we'll talk about next
time as an exception,

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:32.160
it takes five to ten years.
 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.790
The females don't have a
second--they have a child--

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.781
a baby, then they wait five to
ten years before having a baby

00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:42.711
again,
so eggs are very difficult to

00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:43.389
come by.
 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.440
In a group of chimps,
maybe one egg a year is

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.822
available for fertilization,
and the males compete like

00:07:49.822 --> 00:07:51.529
crazy by every possible
mechanism,

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:58.267
including a lot of violence,
to get access to that single

00:07:58.267 --> 00:07:58.990
egg.
 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:05.103
One anecdote about the
relationship of sociology and

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:09.778
sexuality has to do with
orangutans,

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:14.002
who are the most distantly
related of the great apes from

00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:14.379
us.
 

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:18.619
They are just--they are very
clever, like all the great apes,

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:22.786
and they use all kinds of ways
of being attractive to a male

00:08:22.786 --> 00:08:24.129
and vice versa.
 

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.040
One of the ways they use,
like we do, is intellectual

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.769
brilliance.
 

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:31.322
I think Yale students are
evolved especially to use

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:34.379
intellectual brilliance to be
attractive.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:36.293
My college girlfriend,
I fell, I guess,

00:08:36.293 --> 00:08:38.662
in love with her,
because she could do the Latin

00:08:38.662 --> 00:08:39.620
and I couldn't.
 

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.460
I was hopeless.
 

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.066
She was--I was just stunned at
how well--how good--how well she

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:44.590
did it.
 

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.471
Anyway, in 1978 a graduate
student from Stanford went to

00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:54.355
the orangutan research station
in Borneo and his job was

00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:55.509
language.
 

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:58.979
They--a lot of people want to
show how close or how different

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:02.275
great apes are from humans,
so language is a special human

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:02.970
ability.
 

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.495
But the great apes have a
certain degree of it and he

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.528
wanted to find out how much.
 

00:09:08.528 --> 00:09:13.211
He taught an adult female named
Rinnie sign language and the

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:17.259
guy's name was Gary Shapiro,
Rinnie was his mate.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:19.440
It turns out she was a
brilliant student,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.493
she really should have been at
Yale, but she was stuck in

00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:25.220
Borneo and didn't have the money
to come here.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.952
Gary just could not believe how
fast Rinnie learned the

00:09:28.952 --> 00:09:32.825
language, and so he was just
glowing and he loved Rinnie,

00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:34.830
and his research project.
 

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.124
He was going to get famous,
probably being to teach more

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:43.340
language than anyone else has
ever taught to an ape.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.048
Rinnie took all this attention
quite personally.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:48.423
She thought there was something
going on between the two of

00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:50.558
them;
it wasn't all intellectual.

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:52.850
She waited for Gary and nothing
happened,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.379
so one day she took the
dominant role,

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:00.778
as I've heard Yale girls
sometimes do,

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:05.582
and she took Gary by the hand
and did the obvious things to

00:10:05.582 --> 00:10:07.240
try to seduce him.
 

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.720
There's Gary,
what is he going to do?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.253
Well he wasn't very up for
this, like many Yale guys that

00:10:13.253 --> 00:10:17.498
I've heard of,
and so Gary just pushed her

00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:21.960
away not thinking an awful lot
about it,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.298
but being a scientist,
he hadn't read his literature.

00:10:25.298 --> 00:10:30.440
He does not know that there is
no wrath like the wrath of woman

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.269
scorned.
 

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:34.957
Thereafter, she lost all
interest in signing,

00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:39.653
would not cooperate in the
lessons, ruined his PhD thesis

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:40.659
project.
 

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:45.240
So let that be a warning guys.
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:54.320
We've talked about--we talked
last time about orangutans--

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.950
of the great apes,
those five species,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.408
including us--we talked about
the rape that orangutans do;

00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:04.293
we talked about the infanticide
that gorillas do,

00:11:04.293 --> 00:11:09.230
and now we come to chimpanzees
who have yet another system.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.263
Again, always coping with this
idea of the rarity of female

00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:13.750
eggs.
 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.272
Unlike the orangutan and the
gorilla, the males are not

00:11:17.272 --> 00:11:17.990
solitary.
 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.610
The standard--the most common,
there is no standard;

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.960
there are millions of species
and they do millions of

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.820
different things.
 

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.851
The most standard mammal thing
is for the males in some way to

00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:32.753
fight with each other and they
push other males away and one

00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:35.200
male gets one or several
females.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.068
There are exceptions to this
but that's the most common sort

00:11:39.068 --> 00:11:39.659
of way.
 

00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:43.639
Chimpanzees don't do this.
 

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:48.350
They live in a group of males,
and in fact the males that are

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.570
born into a group stay with the
group,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.976
so this a male group that
genetically has been staying

00:11:54.976 --> 00:11:57.740
together for as far back as one
can tell.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.690
Males basically never transfer
groups;

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:06.816
they never leave a group,
so these are basically a long

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:11.038
line, one family set of males.
 

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:16.726
Within that community--let's
see, I think I have some slides

00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:17.690
of this.
 

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.009
Ah, that's a picture of the
orangutan that fell in love with

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.399
the grad student.
 

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:30.298
We'll come to Jane Goodall in a
minute.

00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:33.697
Given that there are males
together, what they do then is

00:12:33.697 --> 00:12:37.519
compete for dominance and a lot
of that is physical fighting.

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:40.751
Their dominance position gives
them access to food and to

00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:41.330
females.
 

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.149
When a chimp wants to move up
in the dominance hierarchy,

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.769
he may go through a long period
where they're sort of jockeying

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:51.423
in various ways,
and I'll describe some of the

00:12:51.423 --> 00:12:52.490
jockeying going on.
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.707
Largely big displays,
beating the chest,

00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:59.337
if there's anything around,
shaking branches,

00:12:59.337 --> 00:13:03.298
stomping on the ground,
hollering, but they don't

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:04.288
fight.
 

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:06.998
But eventually,
if in fact a reversal of

00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:11.235
dominance position is going to
take place, a real fight almost

00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:14.500
always does occur,
not always successfully.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.580
Jane Goodall describes one of
these,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.470
Sherry--and they give names to
each of the chimps--

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.379
Sherry, a younger male,
was moving up in the hierarchy,

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:23.860
an aggressive young male.
 

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.700
You know some of those.
 

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.028
He had beat out some of the
lower ranking young males,

00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:31.980
but the next one on his list
was named Satan.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.460
You can tell from the name this
was not a wise move.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.350
Satan was not the Alpha male,
but was higher than Sherry.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.870
They had a huge fight.
 

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.807
When it was over,
Sherry was bleeding from bad

00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:45.682
wounds on his shoulder,
both hands, his back,

00:13:45.682 --> 00:13:47.379
his head, and one leg.
 

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:51.190
Sherry escaped and ran away
screaming loudly.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.626
This was apparently such a bad
experience that Sherry never

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:59.070
again attempted to dominate any
other male.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.418
He had been whipped,
and he learned whatever his

00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:03.970
instincts may or may not have
been about aggression,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.548
he learned that's not his game;
he never tried this again.

00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:14.070
They do a lot of threats and
displays as--

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.787
prior to these fights--but if
there's going to be a real

00:14:16.787 --> 00:14:19.446
reversal,
there's usually a fight and the

00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:21.379
fight's can get very severe.
 

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:23.706
In the wild,
the loser just runs away and

00:14:23.706 --> 00:14:26.210
they don't carry the fight to
the death,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.029
and by the end of the lecture
you should understand why they

00:14:29.029 --> 00:14:30.558
don't want to kill each other.
 

00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:33.658
In a zoo, when the chimps are
in captivity,

00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:39.559
the males can't escape and then
that proximity leads to a

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:45.250
prolongation of the violence and
sometimes to death.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.587
Frans de Waal,
who you'll do some reading from

00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.850
him;
he describes one fight where

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.065
the loser had an ear gone,
the other ear torn,

00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:59.129
his hands and feet badly mauled
with several bones exposed,

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:01.259
and some fingers and toes
missing.

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:05.147
A gash stretched from one
shoulder to the opposite hip,

00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:08.745
and toes were missing,
and this guy was really beat

00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:09.250
up.
 

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.567
They took him to a human type
hospital and tried to fix him

00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:13.940
up.
 

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.990
It didn't work; he died.
 

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.379
Within a group the fights
basically never end in death.

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:23.580
In captivity they do end in
death;

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.129
that's within-group fighting.
 

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:31.517
This finding your place in the
dominance hierarchy is a very

00:15:31.517 --> 00:15:32.928
serious business.
 

00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:37.860
You can either win and go up or
you can lose and stay and either

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.476
die or get badly physically
damaged or be relegated to a low

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:43.259
place.
 

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.469
Humans call dominance hierarchy
'status,' and when I use

00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:49.460
dominance, think status.
 

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.639
We don't always use the word
here but think--

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:54.634
one of the other things if you
want to compare chimps and

00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:57.600
humans,
think of the various things

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.028
that humans do for status.
 

00:16:00.028 --> 00:16:04.149
Chimps live in groups of about
40 individuals,

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:07.620
with a dozen or so adult males,
approximately the same number

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.416
of females,
and, as with orangutans that

00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:13.749
I've described to you,
the female they have a big

00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:16.919
range, 15 square kilometers,
40 square kilometers,

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:19.870
something like that and they
wander about this.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.620
The females,
when they have a young,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.288
are usually fairly isolated,
not necessarily,

00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.121
not all the time,
but mostly they're by

00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:28.570
themselves with their young.
 

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.778
It's a very stable group that
always stays together.

00:16:31.778 --> 00:16:35.996
As I told you last time,
the mother is never out of

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:39.538
either touch,
or sight, or hearing of their

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:43.418
young for five or more--five to
ten years.

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:46.562
The males, on the other hand,
wander around also but they

00:16:46.562 --> 00:16:47.460
bond together.
 

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.059
They travel together and they
are very often in parties,

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:54.660
and they go around searching
for food and patrolling the

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.558
borders of the territory.
 

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.259
They also of course visit the
females,

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:03.044
go around see which
females--what the sexual status

00:17:03.044 --> 00:17:07.359
of females is and I showed you a
slide last time of a male

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.523
smelling a female's sexual
secretions to figure out what

00:17:11.523 --> 00:17:13.190
status she's in.
 

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.519
This looks like something that
I've already talked about here.

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:24.528
Is this repeating?
 

00:17:24.528 --> 00:17:38.019
All right, so I don't remember
whether I did this.

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:41.603
The females are usually quite
promiscuous with their sex

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:42.318
partners.
 

00:17:42.318 --> 00:17:45.435
In the community followed by
Jane Goodall,

00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:49.161
in each estrus cycle,
each female had at least one

00:17:49.161 --> 00:17:53.190
bout of intercourse with every
male in the group.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.430
Did I--I did do this yesterday.
 

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:04.528
Forget this;
I don't know how this happens.

00:18:04.528 --> 00:18:09.064
How do the males do
their--operate in their

00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:11.440
dominance hierarchy?
 

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.259
It's not all violence.
 

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:17.967
One aspect is violence but they
also make friends with other

00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:18.470
males.
 

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.338
Single males cannot be
successful;

00:18:21.338 --> 00:18:23.589
it's a very,
very social situation.

00:18:23.589 --> 00:18:26.432
These animals are very clever;
they know each other

00:18:26.432 --> 00:18:27.965
individually;
they know each other's

00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:29.662
propensities,
which ones are dominant,

00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:31.615
which ones are not,
which ones are smart,

00:18:31.615 --> 00:18:34.019
which ones are not,
which ones they can fool,

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:36.298
which ones they can't fool,
and so on.

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:41.960
So they do a lot of social
manipulation to try to get

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.769
allies in their dominance
fights.

00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:49.287
In these friend relations you
mostly see it as a grooming

00:18:49.287 --> 00:18:49.788
thing.
 

00:18:49.788 --> 00:18:53.509
Males and females spend a lot
of time with each other

00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:55.868
grooming, and what is grooming?
 

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:59.251
Chimps, like all kinds of other
animals are infested with

00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:02.694
parasites, which can carry
diseases and be very dangerous,

00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:04.868
so they have to get rid of
them.

00:19:04.868 --> 00:19:08.578
So one chimp will sit there and
the other chimp will come by and

00:19:08.578 --> 00:19:12.288
spread the fur very carefully
and then if there's an insect--

00:19:12.288 --> 00:19:15.746
it's good for the person from
whom they take the insect

00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:19.009
because that insect is no
longer-going to parasitize

00:19:19.009 --> 00:19:20.586
them--
and it's good for them,

00:19:20.586 --> 00:19:21.970
they get a little bit of
protein.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.650
They spend hours and hours
doing this.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.534
Males to males,
males and females with each

00:19:25.534 --> 00:19:28.631
other, and females to females;
everybody does it with everyone

00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:31.901
else, and one of the things that
the observers do is count how

00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:34.848
much time each individual spends
grooming the other.

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:38.308
The person--the chimp who's
being groomed has this wonderful

00:19:38.308 --> 00:19:41.710
expression on their face,
they're clearly enjoying this;

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.759
it's like a nice massage.
 

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.700
The purpose of this
friendliness or one of the

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.508
purposes is to help the males
when they engage in dominance

00:20:00.508 --> 00:20:01.420
fights.
 

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.397
Jane Goodall describes one of
these: Goliath,

00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:07.578
one of the males that we'll
talk about later.

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:11.653
Late one evening he arrives in
camp all by himself,

00:20:11.653 --> 00:20:14.259
and he seems a little on edge.
 

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:17.031
Every so often he stands
upright and stares back at the

00:20:17.031 --> 00:20:18.828
direction from which he had
come.

00:20:18.828 --> 00:20:22.690
He seems nervous and startles
at every sound.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.738
Six minutes later,
three adult males appear on one

00:20:26.738 --> 00:20:30.125
of the trails,
and one is the high-ranking

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:30.869
Hugh.
 

00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:35.419
They pause, they seem him;
they pause, their hair on end,

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:40.130
then abruptly they charge down
toward Goliath but he--

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.730
in the time that they were sort
of waiting,

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.529
he then has disappeared quietly
into the forest.

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:50.655
For the next five minutes these
three big guys thrash around the

00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:53.584
underbrush, they're looking for
him, but he has successfully

00:20:53.584 --> 00:20:54.180
escaped.
 

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.810
He is afraid,
obviously one against three,

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.710
he's afraid.
 

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:04.920
The next morning Hugh returns
to camp with two companions.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.414
A few minutes later
Goliath--Goliath the one that

00:21:08.414 --> 00:21:11.130
had run away before--
charges down,

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.750
dragging a huge branch,
that's one of their display

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.760
kinds of things,
and then he runs straight at

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.278
Hugh and attacks him.
 

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.566
The guy that ran away last
time, one against three is still

00:21:22.566 --> 00:21:25.230
one against three,
but now he's the attacker;

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.940
very strange.
 

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.182
It's not until the battle is
already in progress where

00:21:31.182 --> 00:21:35.666
they're grappling and hitting
each other, that it becomes

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:38.308
obvious why he has done that.
 

00:21:38.308 --> 00:21:45.108
There's a--the dominant male,
one of the very--

00:21:45.108 --> 00:21:48.700
not the Alpha but one of the
strong dominant males is a very

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.493
big one called David Graybeard,
and while this fight has just

00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:54.438
begun,
David Graybeard appears from

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.588
the undergrowth and he gives a
display,

00:21:56.588 --> 00:22:06.224
and whoa and gives some pant
hoots and he's clearly on Hugh's

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:08.736
side,
and had obviously been with

00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:12.882
Hugh just before Hugh came in,
so now he had an ally and then

00:22:12.882 --> 00:22:16.920
the outcome of the fight was
very different.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.930
Suddenly Goliath leaps right
onto Hugh,

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.757
grabbing his hair and shoulder,
pounding on his back with both

00:22:23.757 --> 00:22:25.957
feet,
and Hugh gives up and he

00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:30.058
manages to pull away and runs
off screaming and defeated.

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:33.868
The guy that was--I think I got
the names right,

00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:38.246
the guy who was scared last
night, when he has an ally,

00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:40.029
is now the winner.
 

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:44.435
The females are almost as good
as males in the dominance

00:22:44.435 --> 00:22:47.000
coalitions against each other.
 

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.824
Their behavior to arrange these
coalitions is extremely complex

00:22:52.824 --> 00:22:55.828
and manipulative as I've said.
 

00:22:55.828 --> 00:23:00.060
They spend huge amounts of
their time trying to organize

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.704
these coalitions,
and then as soon as there

00:23:03.704 --> 00:23:07.578
is--so several males will be in
a coalition,

00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:10.567
one of them will get to be
Alpha, almost immediately after

00:23:10.567 --> 00:23:13.103
they become Alpha,
the other two go out and form

00:23:13.103 --> 00:23:15.130
other coalitions to try to
displace him.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.278
We have some of our faculty
members like that.

00:23:18.278 --> 00:23:24.298
Last night I was reading a book
about renaissance intrigue,

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:27.960
and it was amazing how some of
the big dukes,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.991
like the Medicis and the
Sforza, and then you have some

00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:35.236
of these smaller guys,
and then you have the Pope

00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:38.086
who's got his own army,
and there's this constantly

00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:41.365
floating crap game of who's
going to be allies with who and

00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:45.065
as soon as someone gets--
one of these principalities

00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:48.171
gets to be dominant,
the coalition rearranges and

00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:49.750
everyone else goes against him.
 

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.186
You can read the history of
Europe in the nineteenth century

00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:56.682
where there's all this balance
of power stuff or you can read

00:23:56.682 --> 00:23:59.846
the newspaper today,
and it's all balance of power

00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:02.318
where they're shifting alliances
and we--

00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:04.400
Japan and Germany were our
great enemies,

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.630
now they're their our great
allies,

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.680
and et cetera.
 

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.642
Russia was an ally in World War
I and II, and then they were an

00:24:11.642 --> 00:24:15.156
enemy, and then they were an
ally again, now maybe be an

00:24:15.156 --> 00:24:16.180
enemy again.
 

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.890
It's--it really doesn't read
terribly differently.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.641
The purpose of all this
fighting for status is of course

00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:35.279
to gain access to females.
 

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:37.260
There's some degree of food,
and we'll talk about whether

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.890
food is a real scarce item for
them or not,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.950
it's usually not a scarce item,
but access to females--

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.667
I think I mentioned this last
time is dependent on the status

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:47.348
of males.
 

00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:51.625
It's not simply size and
aggressiveness at all that

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:56.499
determines dominance but how
good a social manipulator the

00:24:56.499 --> 00:24:59.920
individuals are,
especially females.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.323
If a male has not been nice to
the female, which means sharing

00:25:05.323 --> 00:25:06.828
food with them.
 

00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:10.218
They go and hunt Colubus
monkeys, and if they catch a

00:25:10.218 --> 00:25:13.019
monkey how much of the meat gets
shared,

00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:19.318
how much grooming they do,
and if the male is boorish,

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:22.390
the other chimps will simply
shun him.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.414
They just--when he comes up and
tries to start some kind of

00:25:25.414 --> 00:25:27.971
friendly interaction,
they just turn their back on

00:25:27.971 --> 00:25:29.119
him and walk away.
 

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:31.970
He's shunned and isolated.
 

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.990
The point is,
no matter how strong,

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.724
physically strong and violent a
single male is,

00:25:36.724 --> 00:25:40.470
he can never be Alpha without
the support of the community.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.108
It really is,
not quite democratic,

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:46.288
but has aspects of a democratic
choice,

00:25:46.288 --> 00:25:49.866
and that the male must have the
consent of the community before

00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:51.308
he can become dominant.
 

00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:56.308
This social acceptance,
the value of your peers,

00:25:56.308 --> 00:26:01.006
and your social status is
really the deciding factor in

00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:05.875
who will be dominant and
therefore who will pass on their

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:08.920
genes into the next generation.
 

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:14.182
Now going back to the females,
when the sex behavior of

00:26:14.182 --> 00:26:18.078
chimpanzees was first being
observed,

00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:23.071
the observers were quite struck
with the obvious promiscuity of

00:26:23.071 --> 00:26:24.200
the females.
 

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.990
The females just didn't seem to
care who mated them.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.296
We discussed that last time,
in each mating cycle a female

00:26:31.296 --> 00:26:35.150
will be mated by every single
male in the troop,

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.258
in Jane Goodall's troop,
sometimes not quite so

00:26:38.258 --> 00:26:39.068
extremely.
 

00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:42.550
That was kind of surprising
given the theory that I've

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.243
described to you,
that females should want

00:26:45.243 --> 00:26:47.150
something from the males.
 

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.366
They should want to choose
either the male with the best

00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:52.048
genes,
or the male who's giving them

00:26:52.048 --> 00:26:56.306
the biggest gift,
or something and this just sort

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:59.750
of compliance under any
circumstance,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.458
it was obvious that that's what
they were observing but it

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:05.019
didn't make any sense.
 

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:07.845
Finally, they observed
more--the chimps were obviously

00:27:07.845 --> 00:27:10.990
not terribly easy to observe and
over a lifetime so you know

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.439
what's going on,
and the story is this,

00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:18.902
that when chimps are young,
either males or female,

00:27:18.902 --> 00:27:22.412
the juveniles are under the
domination of their mothers and

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:25.558
the females meet with each other
every so often,

00:27:25.558 --> 00:27:30.990
so any female can dominate any
young independent of sex.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.883
You really, if you just looked
at the social behavior,

00:27:33.883 --> 00:27:36.776
you wouldn't be able to
distinguish a boy infant and a

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:37.650
girl infant.
 

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.740
I'll give you some reading,
about human societies,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.916
many what we call 'primitive
human societies' have the same

00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:44.762
thing,
that even the words for a young

00:27:44.762 --> 00:27:47.796
boy is the same as for a girl,
that they're not distinguished,

00:27:47.796 --> 00:27:50.328
only at some sort of puberty
right do the boy--

00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:56.039
do the biological boys become
socially constructed boys,

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.390
in a sense.
 

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:02.406
In chimpanzees--so when they're
little the females dominate

00:28:02.406 --> 00:28:04.631
them,
but of course the males start

00:28:04.631 --> 00:28:07.904
growing big and in adolescence
they start to get up to the same

00:28:07.904 --> 00:28:11.275
size of the female,
and then what happens is that

00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:15.732
these young males come and start
attacking the females for no

00:28:15.732 --> 00:28:17.740
obvious external reason.
 

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.611
When this first happens the
female is still bigger and she

00:28:21.611 --> 00:28:24.598
swats him away and he runs off
screaming,

00:28:24.598 --> 00:28:27.597
but as he gets bigger,
he comes back and seems to sort

00:28:27.597 --> 00:28:30.368
of choose one female at a time
starting up on--

00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:32.950
there's some mild dominance
hierarchy among females,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.880
not very strong but a little
bit there.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.885
He goes and just gratuitously
attacks one female after another

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:42.118
and keeps doing it:
pushes her,

00:28:42.118 --> 00:28:45.250
punches her,
bites her, pulls the hair,

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.500
and she fights back,
but eventually he's big enough

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.880
to cow her and he becomes
dominant to that female.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.452
Then he goes to the next,
and the next,

00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:58.376
and the next and eventually as
they go through adolescence,

00:28:58.376 --> 00:29:01.828
the young males become dominant
to each female.

00:29:01.828 --> 00:29:07.265
Then, that's not the end of it,
that every so often thereafter,

00:29:07.265 --> 00:29:12.614
they again gratuitously attack
the females for no particularly

00:29:12.614 --> 00:29:14.278
obvious reason.
 

00:29:14.278 --> 00:29:18.625
Let me describe to you
one--read to you one of the

00:29:18.625 --> 00:29:23.058
descriptions of these kind of
dominance attacks.

00:29:23.058 --> 00:29:26.676
This is one of the people
in--studying in Jane Goodall's

00:29:26.676 --> 00:29:29.440
group in Gombe in Tanzania and
this is--

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.667
she is recollecting:
"Nearly 20 years ago I

00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:36.789
spent a morning dashing up and
down the hills of Gombe trying

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:39.950
to keep up with an energetic
young female.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.305
On her rear end she sported
this small bright pink swelling,

00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:46.318
characteristic of the early
stages of estrus."

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.220
She was just coming into her
fertile period and really wasn't

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.960
particularly fertile at that
time.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.682
"For some hours our run
through the park was conducted

00:29:55.682 --> 00:29:58.423
in quiet--
quietly, but then suddenly a

00:29:58.423 --> 00:30:02.268
chorus of male chimpanzee pant
hoots shattered the tranquility

00:30:02.268 --> 00:30:03.338
of the forest.
 

00:30:03.338 --> 00:30:06.078
My female rushed forward to
join the males.

00:30:06.078 --> 00:30:09.384
She greeted each of them,
bowing and then turning to

00:30:09.384 --> 00:30:12.818
present her swelling rear end
for inspection."

00:30:12.818 --> 00:30:14.759
You know, 'hey guys get
interested in me.'

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.348
She's young and a little
inexperienced,

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:19.078
she thought they would be real
hot-to-trot,

00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:22.786
but didn't turn out,
and the males examined her kind

00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:27.220
of perfunctorily and they saw
she wasn't really ready yet,

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.315
and so they resumed grooming
one another and showing no

00:30:30.315 --> 00:30:32.150
interest in this young female.
 

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.460
The scientist here,
the anthropologist was rather

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.220
surprised by this indifference
to a potential mate.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.425
Then she under--she sorted of
recalled and there's--well,

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:47.862
her swelling is really pretty
small so far so she' not ready,

00:30:47.862 --> 00:30:49.180
so she realized it.
 

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.635
It would be a week or two
before she was really going to

00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:54.690
be fertile.
 

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:59.598
Then they'll be really
interested.

00:30:59.598 --> 00:31:02.818
She was sort of watching this,
the males basically grooming

00:31:02.818 --> 00:31:05.872
each other, ignoring this
female, and then boom all of a

00:31:05.872 --> 00:31:07.259
sudden they attacked.
 

00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:09.009
"The attack came without
warning.

00:31:09.009 --> 00:31:13.618
One of the males charged toward
us," the anthropologist was

00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:16.287
with the female,
"One of the males charged

00:31:16.287 --> 00:31:19.202
toward us hair on end,
looking twice as large as my

00:31:19.202 --> 00:31:20.960
small female and enraged.
 

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.584
As he rushed by he picked her
up, hurled her to ground,

00:31:24.584 --> 00:31:25.859
and pummeled her.
 

00:31:25.859 --> 00:31:27.920
She cringed and screamed.
 

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.471
He ran off, rejoining the other
male's seconds later as if

00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:33.279
nothing had happened."
 

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:36.038
He attacks this one and then
nothing happened.

00:31:36.038 --> 00:31:38.769
It was not so easy for the
female to return to normal.

00:31:38.769 --> 00:31:42.443
She whimpered and darted about,
darted nervous glances at her

00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:46.241
attacker and he--she was worried
he was going to just charge at

00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:47.098
her again.
 

00:31:47.098 --> 00:31:51.607
The primatologist continues
that in the years that followed

00:31:51.607 --> 00:31:54.640
she saw many such assaults like
this.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.279
What's the purpose of this?
 

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:01.048
These attacks do not end in
sex, so they're not rape.

00:32:01.048 --> 00:32:05.339
What happens is the male
establishes a dominance over the

00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:06.028
female.
 

00:32:06.028 --> 00:32:08.884
She's afraid of him--as I told
you they of course know each

00:32:08.884 --> 00:32:11.098
other individually and remember
over many,

00:32:11.098 --> 00:32:14.330
many years and so these attacks
during adolescence when they

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.467
establish their dominance,
and then the continual

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:21.826
reminders that they're dominant
and they can coerce them at any

00:32:21.826 --> 00:32:24.710
minute is what the purpose of
this is.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.982
So when she does come into
estrus and all the males are

00:32:27.982 --> 00:32:31.741
around and there's only a very
short window of opportunity when

00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:33.406
he may--
she may be alone,

00:32:33.406 --> 00:32:36.553
the other males are fighting or
not paying attention for a

00:32:36.553 --> 00:32:38.452
moment--
remember he only needs 15

00:32:38.452 --> 00:32:41.402
seconds, remember I described
that last time for a bout of

00:32:41.402 --> 00:32:43.662
intercourse--
he has 15 seconds before the

00:32:43.662 --> 00:32:46.170
other males are going to come
and interrupt him.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.170
The last thing he wants is for
her to resist.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.548
She has to be compliant in that
very short time,

00:32:53.548 --> 00:32:55.588
sort of a like a private in an
army,

00:32:55.588 --> 00:32:57.910
don't ask questions do whatever
you're told immediately,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.246
and this prior violence the
purpose of this prior violence

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:06.507
is to cow the females into
submission at that moment when

00:33:06.507 --> 00:33:08.789
they need this submission.
 

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.828
That is the chimp system.
 

00:33:21.828 --> 00:33:25.232
It's--to our eyes it's not a
very pretty kind of system and

00:33:25.232 --> 00:33:28.695
you can think how much of that
we still do something similar

00:33:28.695 --> 00:33:30.750
and that's up to you to decide.
 

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:38.788
We've described now three other
great apes,

00:33:38.788 --> 00:33:41.006
aside from us,
and there's the fourth great

00:33:41.006 --> 00:33:43.538
ape species which you probably
have heard of,

00:33:43.538 --> 00:33:45.858
called Bonobos,
and for a long time--

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:47.529
they're very similar to the
chimps.

00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:49.990
I showed you last time the
evolutionary tree.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.148
They split off from chimps and
Bonobos have split off very

00:33:53.148 --> 00:33:55.808
recently, so they're still very
much the same.

00:33:55.808 --> 00:33:58.568
The Bonobos are a little bit
smaller;

00:33:58.568 --> 00:34:01.778
the difference in size between
males and females is not so

00:34:01.778 --> 00:34:02.230
great.
 

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.769
Their behavior is enormously
different.

00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:11.039
There's almost no violence in a
Bonobo troop.

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:17.088
The various Bonobo troops don't
get into violent attacks with

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.400
each other.
 

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.309
What they do is have sex a lot,
that anything that comes--

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:27.230
anything that in a chimpanzee
would elicit violence--

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.010
competition for food,
competition for females,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.190
whatever--they have sex,
and somehow that diffuses it.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:41.190
They do everything you can
dream of--somehow there's

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.309
something wrong.
 

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.920
Anyway, what happens is,
males or females may initiate

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.440
the sex bout.
 

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.706
They often do it face to face
which is not a usual animal sort

00:35:11.706 --> 00:35:13.576
of thing,
and the picture that I had,

00:35:13.576 --> 00:35:16.963
and I don't know where they--
why they're not being pulled

00:35:16.963 --> 00:35:20.289
up--is first a male and a female
copulating,

00:35:20.289 --> 00:35:24.369
sort of face to face and what
you'd recognize immediately what

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:27.590
was going on,
and they seem happy about that.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.610
Then I have another slide of
two females going at it,

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.864
and what they do is they stand
face to face and rub their

00:35:33.864 --> 00:35:35.550
genital regions together.
 

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.849
Of course what do the
primatologists call that?

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:41.739
Genital-genital rubbing,
perfectly neutral.

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:45.112
Now the locals where these
Bonobos live they are much--they

00:35:45.112 --> 00:35:47.902
understand better,
and so what do the locals call

00:35:47.902 --> 00:35:48.309
it?
 

00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:50.190
Hoka, hoka.
 

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.699
So there's a long picture of
hoka, hoka.

00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:56.934
In previous years I had--I
won't tell you this story,

00:35:56.934 --> 00:35:59.949
very interesting
story--afterwards.

00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:04.293
The question is--there's
essentially no dominance of the

00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:08.556
males over the females,
or very little dominance of the

00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:10.690
males over the females.
 

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.590
You don't see this violent
theme happening.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.141
You read about this,
there's several readings on

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:19.289
Bonobos because I don't have
time in the lecture to talk so

00:36:19.289 --> 00:36:23.536
much about them,
but it seems that what's going

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:26.679
on is --
Bonobos live one side of the

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:30.230
Congo River and chimpanzees the
other side,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.853
and on the side where Bonobos
are, there are also gorillas and

00:36:33.853 --> 00:36:36.409
so they compete for the same
food source.

00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:40.184
I'm sorry, on the side where
the chimps are they're

00:36:40.184 --> 00:36:42.449
also--have I got this right?
 

00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:46.670
Gorillas--and so they compete
for the food source,

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.963
there's not that much food so
the chimps have to forage pretty

00:36:51.963 --> 00:36:54.905
much alone,
the females get isolated,

00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:58.289
and therefore they're subject
to male dominance.

00:36:58.289 --> 00:37:01.342
In the Bonobos territory
there's more--a greater food

00:37:01.342 --> 00:37:05.159
density so the females can stay
together and forage as a party.

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:07.119
As you will read,
there's female power;

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:10.117
the females stay together,
and if a male comes and tries

00:37:10.117 --> 00:37:13.280
to dominant one of the females,
her sisters support her and

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.480
beat the male off.
 

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.282
So in evolution they've sort of
given up trying that trick,

00:37:18.282 --> 00:37:21.559
and now everybody copulates
with everybody else.

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:23.570
What do we call that when
there's this great promiscuity?

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.559
What's the form of competition
going on?

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:29.960
Sperm competition,
and so one of the ways that the

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.835
Bonobos evolve is that they're--
in evolution the testes get

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:37.195
bigger and bigger,
and so you measure the ratio of

00:37:37.195 --> 00:37:41.452
testes size in a Bonobo which
has a lot of sperm competition

00:37:41.452 --> 00:37:44.409
to chimpanzees which have a lot
less,

00:37:44.409 --> 00:37:46.688
very little because they
fight--the males fight each

00:37:46.688 --> 00:37:49.079
other,
and what you find is that as a

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:55.123
fraction of total body size,
the Bonobo testes are much

00:37:55.123 --> 00:38:00.579
larger than the chimpanzee
testes.

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:05.534
We've seen four different
models of male/female

00:38:05.534 --> 00:38:09.949
relationships:
the rape in orangutans,

00:38:09.949 --> 00:38:13.159
infanticide in gorillas,
battering in chimps,

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:16.630
and total promiscuity in
Bonobos.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.920
One of the questions that you
can ask is which one most

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.869
resembles the human condition?
 

00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:25.574
Well it turns out that if you
do the statistics,

00:38:25.574 --> 00:38:28.570
in human's, rape is relatively
rare.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:33.157
Of course we all know that it
happens, but it's not a frequent

00:38:33.157 --> 00:38:33.760
event.
 

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.333
Infanticide,
which you'll see happens very

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:39.659
frequently, but not against the
will of the mother.

00:38:39.659 --> 00:38:44.324
The males, unrelated males,
killing the infants of other

00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:48.056
females is a very,
very rare event in humans,

00:38:48.056 --> 00:38:51.619
again it happens,
but it's quite rare.

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:55.409
The common form of male/female
human violence,

00:38:55.409 --> 00:38:57.179
what do we call it?
 

00:38:57.179 --> 00:38:58.570
Battering, right.
 

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.606
Battering is extremely common
almost all over the earth and

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:07.079
for as far back in history as we
know.

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:10.349
Various studies have been done
in different places.

00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:14.971
In Punjab in North India,
75% of scheduled cast women,

00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:18.981
that's lower caste women,
reported being beaten

00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:21.860
frequently by their husbands.
 

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.916
There's an agreement there,
75% of the men report beating

00:39:25.916 --> 00:39:26.929
their wives.
 

00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:31.300
In Bangladesh 47% of the women
report having been beaten.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:36.398
A study of ten countries
ranging from Japan to Ethiopia

00:39:36.398 --> 00:39:41.306
showed that in most sites
between 30% and 56% of ever

00:39:41.306 --> 00:39:45.992
partnered women,
had experienced both physical

00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.949
and sexual violence.
 

00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:49.469
Of course these are almost
certainly,

00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:53.067
whenever you collect statistics
on something that is not exactly

00:39:53.067 --> 00:39:56.422
appreciated in the society,
you're getting a very low

00:39:56.422 --> 00:39:56.949
report.
 

00:39:56.949 --> 00:39:59.427
These are certainly under
reports because people don't

00:39:59.427 --> 00:40:02.159
want to report it,
but also when you ask about not

00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:04.664
just casual,
a little bit of violence,

00:40:04.664 --> 00:40:08.713
but, 'Have you been severely
beaten,' in a society where 75%

00:40:08.713 --> 00:40:11.389
of the women are beaten
frequently,

00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:14.375
the standard for what they're
going to call severe is going to

00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:15.110
be very high.
 

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:20.306
If you used our understanding
of male/female battering the

00:40:20.306 --> 00:40:24.409
numbers would clearly be much,
much higher.

00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:32.219
What's interesting is there's a
fair amount of collusion between

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:34.974
the males and the females in
this beating,

00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:36.250
this battering.
 

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.639
Both--in the culture--both the
men and the women feel that it

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:45.250
is the husband's right to beat
the woman, and it's justified.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.079
It's the woman's due.
 

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.471
She should be beaten,
and they talk about this quite

00:40:49.471 --> 00:40:52.800
openly;
40% to 80% again in different

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.601
surveys, 40% to 80% of wives
agree that a beating is

00:40:57.601 --> 00:41:02.309
justified if a wife neglects
household chores or is

00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:03.909
disobedient.
 

00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:07.469
Again, disobedient probably has
a much more minor meaning--

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:12.115
disobedience worth a beating
would not be even considered

00:41:12.115 --> 00:41:17.590
disobedience by us maybe,
probably very minor.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.516
Severe beating is almost
uniformly justified and condoned

00:41:21.516 --> 00:41:24.320
for many reasons,
including for example,

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.630
a husband--a woman disobeying
her husband's orders.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.976
If a husband gives a woman a
direct order and she does not

00:41:30.976 --> 00:41:32.679
follow it, she gets beaten.
 

00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:42.590
It's her duty to obey her
husband and they describe it--

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.610
the women talking to each other
and talking to investigators

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.889
describe it as selfish when she
follows what she wants to do,

00:41:48.889 --> 00:41:51.856
which of course there is always
conflict between what Person A

00:41:51.856 --> 00:41:54.056
wants to do and Person B,
then they said,

00:41:54.056 --> 00:41:56.179
'I was selfish,
I deserved a beating.

00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:59.586
Or they say that of another
woman, 'She was selfish and she

00:41:59.586 --> 00:42:00.880
deserves a beating.'
 

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.422
In the U.S.
 

00:42:01.422 --> 00:42:04.239
of course we haven't escaped
this, this has now become--

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:07.659
it was hush hush for a very
long time,

00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:10.351
but now it's fairly open
because of the feminist

00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:13.014
movement,
and the numbers are something

00:42:13.014 --> 00:42:14.103
like 50% of U.S.
 

00:42:14.103 --> 00:42:18.322
women will be physically abused
by the men with whom they live,

00:42:18.322 --> 00:42:20.909
so again this is partner
violence.

00:42:20.909 --> 00:42:25.215
Six million will be really
battered and that's way more

00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:28.643
than rape, and auto accidents,
and muggings,

00:42:28.643 --> 00:42:32.469
and every other kind of mishap
put together.

00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:39.500
Battering seems to be both the
chimpanzee mode of violence,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.369
it's not the orangutan,
it's not the ape,

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:43.489
and it's certainly not--not the
orangutan,

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:46.210
not the gorilla,
and certainly not the Bonobo,

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:51.315
but humans seems to engage in
the same kind of violence as

00:42:51.315 --> 00:42:52.570
chimpanzees.
 

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:58.217
The most wonderful quote that I
have describing this is from a

00:42:58.217 --> 00:43:03.960
Palestinian woman and she says,
"Men have small brains.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.219
If you feed them,
cook for them,

00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:09.719
and clean for them,
maybe then they will not beat

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:10.739
you."
 

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:15.440
That's a great tag.
 

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.871
Okay, so now I've spun a nice
story for you,

00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:27.692
the way chimpanzee's social
organization around sex and

00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:29.840
reproduction.
 

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.208
I don't know if any of you have
noticed there's something really

00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.440
wrong with the story.
 

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.514
Wrong, incomplete,
incorrect, anybody think of

00:43:38.514 --> 00:43:39.510
anything?
 

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.119
What have I described to you?
 

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.949
I've described to you on the
first hand that these males

00:43:43.949 --> 00:43:46.110
fight with each other their
whole lives.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.750
A male, he has not much else to
do, than feed and think about

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.449
his part in the dominance.
 

00:43:51.449 --> 00:43:54.115
In the whole year there's going
to be one or two females ready

00:43:54.115 --> 00:43:56.170
to be inseminated,
and what do they do the whole

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.090
rest of the year?
 

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:00.579
They're fighting for dominance,
and finally you get to have an

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:03.715
Alpha male,
and most of the time he's in

00:44:03.715 --> 00:44:08.639
strong control and really can
control all the other males.

00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:14.570
That's the naked ape kind of
story which you've heard.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.809
Wait a minute,
what else have I also told you?

00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:21.650
Every time the female comes
into estrus she does it with

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.489
everybody.
 

00:44:22.489 --> 00:44:24.760
Those two stories don't jibe
with each other.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.777
There's some contradictory
thing going on there,

00:44:28.777 --> 00:44:33.737
and that's the next part of the
whole story that we have to

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.018
figure out.
 

00:44:35.018 --> 00:44:38.237
Why, since the Alpha male could
easily win when there's a really

00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:40.804
strong Alpha male--
could easily keep all the other

00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:43.914
males away from the females,
it's only a couple of weeks

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:47.585
that she's at all fertile,
and he's spent the whole year

00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:48.389
being boss.
 

00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:53.300
Why doesn't he keep the other
males away and get all the

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.980
sexual activity for himself?
 

00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:02.068
It's an interesting--it's a
surprising thing and it tells

00:45:02.068 --> 00:45:07.179
you that something is missing
from the story.

00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:08.599
This is where Jane Goodall
comes in;

00:45:08.599 --> 00:45:11.373
she's responsible for almost
everything about chimpanzees and

00:45:11.373 --> 00:45:12.900
the whole field of primatology.
 

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.710
She's a real hero of mine.
 

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.054
I'm angry that Yale has never
given her an honorary degree

00:45:18.054 --> 00:45:20.989
even though she lives right here
in Connecticut.

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:24.179
It's really--that's shameful.
 

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:28.746
What's her story?--Just a
little bit of personal interest:

00:45:28.746 --> 00:45:33.074
she was 23 years old in 1960
and she--in her biography,

00:45:33.074 --> 00:45:36.119
she always loved watching
animals.

00:45:36.119 --> 00:45:38.996
She would go into the hen house
and just sit there and her

00:45:38.996 --> 00:45:41.672
mother couldn't find her,
and then look where the hens

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.440
are, well that's where Jane is.
 

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.280
She's not from a family that
was sort of education bound.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.909
She had not been to a
university;

00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:53.449
she had no particular career,
but she was invited to visit a

00:45:53.449 --> 00:45:55.806
friend in Africa and--
in a lot of England,

00:45:55.806 --> 00:45:57.501
at that time,
Africa is sort of a very

00:45:57.501 --> 00:46:00.507
romantic kind of place,
because every young person

00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:02.409
wants to go and see Africa.
 

00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:05.860
She took a job as a waitress
because she wasn't trained to do

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.456
anything else,
and saved up enough money so

00:46:08.456 --> 00:46:11.170
she could get this steamboat
passage to Kenya.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:15.699
She took a boat to Kenya in
1960.

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:19.561
She met up fairly soon with
Louis Leakey in the expatriate

00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:22.340
community, the English community
there.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.030
Louis Leakey you may have heard
of.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.880
His family has done all the
paleontology,

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.409
all the digging up of Lucy--I
think Lucy's one of theirs,

00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:32.643
and all of the other skeletons,
and sort of rewritten the

00:46:32.643 --> 00:46:34.320
history of human evolution.
 

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.320
The idea being basically there
were lots of branches that--

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.099
our species just didn't grow
out of chimpanzees but there

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:44.880
were lots and lots of species
floating around and all the

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.119
others went extinct and what
survived is us.

00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:50.739
Here comes this young woman and
she doesn't really have a job

00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:53.284
and she needs some support,
and she loves Africa and she

00:46:53.284 --> 00:46:55.490
loves animals,
and Leakey gets an idea that

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:59.030
well, no one has been able to go
out and see what chimpanzees do.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:02.389
They knew by that time they
were our closest relative.

00:47:02.389 --> 00:47:05.670
They didn't really understand
about Bonobos at that time,

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.909
and Bonobos didn't live where
he was anyway,

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:13.331
and so he says to her,
"Are you interested at all

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:17.920
in going out and trying to
observe chimpanzees?"

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.179
She says, "Yes,
yes, yes!"

00:47:22.179 --> 00:47:25.079
He says, "you know,
they don't like humans.

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:26.960
They run away,
and if they don't run away

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.699
they'll probably try to attack
you.

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:30.717
These are big,
violent beasties,

00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.449
and you may be in physical
danger."

00:47:33.449 --> 00:47:35.710
She says "Yeah,
yeah, yeah I want to do

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.289
it."
 

00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:38.389
He says, "You're an
attractive young woman

00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:40.400
and…what did I say 23 or
something?

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.239
"There aren't going to be
any men around.

00:47:42.239 --> 00:47:44.715
You're going to be living in
the jungle basically by

00:47:44.715 --> 00:47:45.250
yourself.
 

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.590
Are you sure you want to do
it?"

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.889
"Yeah, yeah,
yeah I want to do it."

00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:50.382
He says "You know,
it's going to take you ten

00:47:50.382 --> 00:47:52.090
years before you're going to be
able to see anything,

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.927
you have to get them accustomed
to you so that you can even

00:47:54.927 --> 00:47:56.851
observe them,
then you'll have to be able to

00:47:56.851 --> 00:47:59.213
watch them over long periods of
time to understand their social

00:47:59.213 --> 00:48:00.958
behavior,
do you really want to do

00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:01.480
it?"
 

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.619
Yes, she decides to do it.
 

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:06.867
She later on recounts this
discussion where he said it

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:11.083
would take ten years,
and she said if I had done it

00:48:11.083 --> 00:48:16.668
for only ten years I would not
have seen the violence that I

00:48:16.668 --> 00:48:18.750
did eventually see.
 

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.175
In fact, in took 25 years
before she saw the events that

00:48:23.175 --> 00:48:25.670
I'm going to describe to you.
 

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:29.331
The violent events that I'm
going to describe are in

00:48:29.331 --> 00:48:32.849
chimpanzee communities about
once a generation.

00:48:32.849 --> 00:48:35.922
More or less like humans,
if you take the time say in the

00:48:35.922 --> 00:48:38.257
West between--
the Napoleonic War,

00:48:38.257 --> 00:48:41.251
the 1870 War,
a little bit long from the

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:44.608
French Franco-Prussian War,
to World War I,

00:48:44.608 --> 00:48:48.592
World War II -- seem to do it
more or less every generation or

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.686
so,
ballpark 25 years,

00:48:50.686 --> 00:48:55.777
and that's very variable and
chimpanzee violence has that

00:48:55.777 --> 00:48:58.869
same sort of a character to it.
 

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:02.989
In 1962 she started observing a
group of--

00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:06.110
it was a large group,
much larger than is usual,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.610
there were 19 adult and
adolescent males,

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:14.050
and then along with females and
the young.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.822
The main thing that they were
watching was the social

00:49:16.822 --> 00:49:17.409
behavior.
 

00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:19.635
They weren't really interested
in the physiology or that kind

00:49:19.635 --> 00:49:21.527
of stuff at the time;
it was really the social

00:49:21.527 --> 00:49:21.960
behavior.
 

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.840
They watched who was doing what
with whom,

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.759
and one of the things they
noticed were two individuals

00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:29.760
that they considered best
friends,

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.835
Goliath and Jomio,
and they spent a very long time

00:49:32.835 --> 00:49:36.099
grooming each other and all
friendly interactions.

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:39.824
They saw these two individual
interacting over six years and

00:49:39.824 --> 00:49:41.719
it was nothing but friendly.
 

00:49:41.719 --> 00:49:46.847
Gradually this large group--she
had started banana feeding the

00:49:46.847 --> 00:49:47.518
group.
 

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:50.454
in order to be able to see them
she would put out bananas and

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:53.438
they would come and get it and
they would get used to her that

00:49:53.438 --> 00:49:53.829
way.
 

00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:56.123
For a long time other
scientists thought she may have

00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:59.518
distorted the behavior,
but it turns out everything she

00:49:59.518 --> 00:50:03.800
saw has been seen again when
there was no banana feeding,

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.929
so that was not a real issue.
 

00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:10.469
She watched this group for many
years, six years or so,

00:50:10.469 --> 00:50:12.829
and then things started to
change.

00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:15.639
Gradually the two groups
started separating,

00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:19.614
there was sort of a northern
mountain hill with a ravine and

00:50:19.614 --> 00:50:23.114
a southern mountain and hill,
and one group started

00:50:23.114 --> 00:50:27.152
spending--one subset of this one
big group started spending more

00:50:27.152 --> 00:50:30.869
time on the northern hill and
another group on the southern

00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:31.510
hill.
 

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.081
And the northern group was
somewhat larger but not a huge

00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:34.679
difference.
 

00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:37.922
There were eight fully mature
males in the northern group and

00:50:37.922 --> 00:50:41.115
only six in the southern group,
along with three females,

00:50:41.115 --> 00:50:43.070
for instance in the southern
group.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.639
First she just--they just
watched how much time they

00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:47.199
spent.
 

00:50:47.199 --> 00:50:51.175
They recorded everything and
they started seeing the group

00:50:51.175 --> 00:50:52.639
split a little bit.
 

00:50:52.639 --> 00:50:55.710
Then when--but it wasn't
absolute, they were still seen

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:59.188
in each other's territory,
but after a while they never

00:50:59.188 --> 00:51:01.800
saw males alone in the wrong
territory;

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.791
they started traveling only in
groups when they were in the

00:51:06.791 --> 00:51:08.340
other territory.
 

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.583
It was clear that they were
beginning--this one group was

00:51:11.583 --> 00:51:14.768
beginning to fission into two
rather separate groups.

00:51:14.768 --> 00:51:19.438
One day six northern males,
most of the males were observed

00:51:19.438 --> 00:51:23.463
traveling together in their own
northern territory,

00:51:23.463 --> 00:51:26.199
but they were near the border.
 

00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:29.860
They were kind of patrolling
what was becoming the border,

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.429
and they heard calling from the
south.

00:51:32.429 --> 00:51:37.391
They became silent and then
moved very quickly directly to

00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:40.440
where they had heard the
calling.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.880
What they saw was Godi,
a southern male;

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.800
he was feeding up in a tree and
not doing anything in

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.530
particular.
 

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.695
He noticed them coming and he
jumped down and ran away,

00:51:50.695 --> 00:51:53.626
but Humphrey,
one of the northern guys,

00:51:53.626 --> 00:51:56.480
chased after him and tackled
him.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.909
Then--Humphrey was big--once he
had tackled him,

00:51:59.909 --> 00:52:03.079
he got on top of him,
and held down his--

00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:05.760
sat on his face actually and
held his hands,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.119
another one came in and held
down the feet,

00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:13.115
so they basically immobilized
Godi and then they started

00:52:13.115 --> 00:52:14.570
attacking him.
 

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.409
The others--remember there's
six males,

00:52:16.409 --> 00:52:20.940
two to hold him down,
they attacked--

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.429
ripped off his skin,
gashes on the face,

00:52:23.429 --> 00:52:25.054
on the nose,
on the mouth,

00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:28.378
puncture in the leg,
puncture wounds in the ribs,

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:31.840
and eventually he was beaten so
badly that he was just

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.719
motionless,
plopped out there.

00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:35.739
Then the attackers just left.
 

00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:39.119
They didn't kill him or
anything, they just left,

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:43.204
but he was so badly wounded
that he died shortly thereafter

00:52:43.204 --> 00:52:43.980
anyway.
 

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.005
Seven weeks later three
northern males attacked Dee,

00:52:48.005 --> 00:52:49.900
another southern male.
 

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.032
Dee runs up a tree and starts
trying to escape by jumping from

00:52:54.032 --> 00:52:55.804
branch--
from tree to tree,

00:52:55.804 --> 00:52:59.514
but these are big animals and
sometimes they grab a not strong

00:52:59.514 --> 00:53:00.550
enough branch.
 

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.322
He grabs a branch,
it cracks, and he's left

00:53:03.322 --> 00:53:04.050
dangling.
 

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:07.880
So they pulled him down,
and the three males that had--

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.018
doing the attack kept beating
him, and he first huddled up and

00:53:12.018 --> 00:53:16.429
then he lay flat on the ground
no longer even trying to escape.

00:53:16.429 --> 00:53:18.802
There were females in party,
at this point when he was not

00:53:18.802 --> 00:53:21.010
so much a danger anymore he was
pretty motionless,

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.775
they joined in,
and the females then started

00:53:23.775 --> 00:53:24.739
dragging him.
 

00:53:24.739 --> 00:53:27.795
He was faintly squeaking as
they dragged him along the

00:53:27.795 --> 00:53:31.315
ground and in the dragging the
skin was torn from him and then

00:53:31.315 --> 00:53:34.659
they started biting him and
flaying off his skin with their

00:53:34.659 --> 00:53:37.211
teeth,
and then after he was

00:53:37.211 --> 00:53:40.130
sufficiently done they just
left.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.900
He actually lived for a few
months;

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:46.353
his spine and his pelvis were
protruding from outside the

00:53:46.353 --> 00:53:46.909
skin.
 

00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:51.429
His scrotum had shrunk to one
fifth of its normal size.

00:53:51.429 --> 00:53:53.489
He died.
 

00:53:53.489 --> 00:53:55.130
A whole year passes.
 

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.039
Five males attack Goliath.
 

00:53:57.039 --> 00:53:59.909
Goliath is the one we talked
about already,

00:53:59.909 --> 00:54:02.876
who by this time is an
extremely old male with teeth

00:54:02.876 --> 00:54:05.650
worn down to the gums,
so clearly not a threat to

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:08.981
anybody,
he was too old to be a threat,

00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:11.268
and Jomio,
who had been his previous

00:54:11.268 --> 00:54:14.262
grooming partner,
and had been watched for six

00:54:14.262 --> 00:54:19.014
years - they were buddies - and
he's part of the attacking party

00:54:19.014 --> 00:54:23.090
and he attacks Goliath just like
any of the others.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:27.800
Goliath was beaten for 20
minutes and he tries to protect

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.322
his head,
but eventually he's too beaten

00:54:30.322 --> 00:54:32.090
and just gives up and lies
still,

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:35.960
and in this particular case the
adolescent males were along,

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.389
and they watched this.
 

00:54:37.389 --> 00:54:40.117
They stay a safe distance away
but they're watching this and

00:54:40.117 --> 00:54:42.472
they get all very excited,
they hoot and holler,

00:54:42.472 --> 00:54:44.880
and jumping all around--
you've probably seen

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.920
kids--human kids behave that
way.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.487
Then again, once Goliath was
pretty much immobilized they ran

00:54:52.487 --> 00:54:57.500
in and contributed their degree
of violence to this.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.871
Again, same story,
they didn't bother to kill him,

00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:03.280
they just went away,
but he died.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.280
This continues and one after
the other,

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.449
and three years after the first
kill,

00:55:10.449 --> 00:55:16.141
the northern males caught Sniff
who was the last remaining

00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:17.739
southern male.
 

00:55:17.739 --> 00:55:20.282
Satan was one of the attackers,
you've heard Satan before,

00:55:20.282 --> 00:55:23.001
and he grabbed him by the neck
and sucked blood from his nose,

00:55:23.001 --> 00:55:25.659
he had been cut in the nose;
he sucked the blood.

00:55:25.659 --> 00:55:28.900
Two males grabbed one leg each
and dragged him down into a

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.958
ravine and again the same thing,
they beat him up,

00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:34.789
they left him to die,
and he did indeed die.

00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:38.349
So Sniff was the last male in
the southern group.

00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:41.280
The females were also not
spared.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.079
Madame B who was a crippled
female, and her daughter Little

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:50.407
B both were in estrus,
so both were sexually ready,

00:55:50.407 --> 00:55:53.280
sexually available,
but it didn't matter;

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.889
they were attacked.
 

00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:59.164
They had a series of attacks on
the females over the course of a

00:55:59.164 --> 00:56:01.190
year,
and in the last attack,

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.130
after she had stopped moving
completely,

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:08.050
Jomio--it was observed Jomio,
the male we've seen,

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.588
picked her up,
slams her down,

00:56:09.588 --> 00:56:12.271
stomps on her,
rolls her over and over along

00:56:12.271 --> 00:56:14.699
the slope,
and then he let her go.

00:56:14.699 --> 00:56:18.025
When she tried to get up
another male comes in and slams

00:56:18.025 --> 00:56:22.139
her to the ground again and beat
her again until she's senseless,

00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:25.429
and she dies five days after
this attack.

00:56:25.429 --> 00:56:30.090
Eventually the southern group
was totally wiped out.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.659
They saw some killing of the
juveniles,

00:56:32.659 --> 00:56:34.893
of the infants,
but they couldn't observe that

00:56:34.893 --> 00:56:38.018
all and the presumption is that
the infants that they didn't see

00:56:38.018 --> 00:56:40.802
actually being killed,
they lost their mothers,

00:56:40.802 --> 00:56:43.927
they couldn't survive so they
just died in the jungle

00:56:43.927 --> 00:56:44.710
somewhere.
 

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.436
But no individual from the
southern group was ever seen

00:56:48.436 --> 00:56:48.989
again.
 

00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:52.730
What happens then?
 

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:58.213
Now this northern group,
called the Kasakela Group,

00:56:58.213 --> 00:56:59.750
is dominant.
 

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.369
They expand into the southern
territory;

00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:06.019
now they have sort of basically
twice the size territory and

00:57:06.019 --> 00:57:08.742
they sort of luxuriate in that
in some sense,

00:57:08.742 --> 00:57:10.659
and it lasts all of a year.
 

00:57:10.659 --> 00:57:13.652
Then they come in contact with
the next group to the south

00:57:13.652 --> 00:57:15.699
which is even stronger than they
are.

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:20.692
They had nine--that community
had nine fully adult--fully

00:57:20.692 --> 00:57:22.030
mature males.
 

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.092
In the next year that's--that
next southern group starts

00:57:26.092 --> 00:57:30.670
attacking what was the northern
group and almost destroys them,

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.739
almost annihilates them.
 

00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:35.822
They're pushed out of their
newly won territory and even

00:57:35.822 --> 00:57:38.905
north of their 'pre-war
boundary' so they were worse off

00:57:38.905 --> 00:57:41.260
than they were before their two
wars,

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.918
and in the meantime,
they were being pushed north

00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:47.130
but there was another strong
community in the north pushing

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.347
south,
and it looked very bad for this

00:57:49.347 --> 00:57:49.710
group.
 

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.250
Jane Goodall and her staff by
then,

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.329
which had grown fairly large,
was worried they had spent 20

00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:57.880
years or 25 years studying these
individuals,

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.342
had all their history,
it was the only group that they

00:58:00.342 --> 00:58:02.760
could really understand who the
individuals were,

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.650
and it really looked like they
were just going to be wiped out.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.246
As it turned out,
they got lucky that just at the

00:58:10.246 --> 00:58:13.710
time when it looked like her
group was going to be wiped out,

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.630
some of the adolescent males
turned fully mature and the

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.340
balance of power was
re-established.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:24.045
When two groups are more or
less equally strong they don't

00:58:24.045 --> 00:58:25.280
engage in fights.
 

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.302
These fights only happen when a
group from one community goes

00:58:29.302 --> 00:58:33.190
and finds a single individual
from the other community,

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:36.550
and then they go and kill them,
or beat them up very badly.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.481
The group that's attacking
basically does not take any

00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:40.954
risks,
and in the course of these

00:58:40.954 --> 00:58:43.248
three years,
the northern group lost nobody

00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:45.960
and the southern group was
totally wiped out.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.606
They only engage in this
violence when they're sure to

00:58:49.606 --> 00:58:50.018
win.
 

00:58:50.018 --> 00:58:54.954
You can read about human
primitive warfare as it has very

00:58:54.954 --> 00:58:57.599
much this similar character.
 

00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:01.693
As soon as this group got
strong enough by the luck of

00:59:01.693 --> 00:59:04.860
adolescent males becoming fully
adult,

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:08.710
what they then--the two groups
would meet at the boundary,

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:12.255
they'd scream and yell at each
other and bang their chest and

00:59:12.255 --> 00:59:15.927
all this kind of stuff and--
but then they'd back off and

00:59:15.927 --> 00:59:21.518
retreat into their territory,
so Goodall's group was saved.

00:59:21.518 --> 00:59:24.443
Now the question comes up,
as I mentioned,

00:59:24.443 --> 00:59:28.440
does this have anything to do
with the banana feeding?

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.963
Did somehow Jane Goodall's
treatment of these animal

00:59:32.963 --> 00:59:35.711
groups--
they saw a big group in the

00:59:35.711 --> 00:59:37.860
beginning,
maybe that wasn't a natural

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.259
group, maybe it was two
different groups that came

00:59:40.259 --> 00:59:42.619
into--
that sort of joined for the

00:59:42.619 --> 00:59:46.675
purpose of getting bananas and
then they reverted to their

00:59:46.675 --> 00:59:50.090
prior hostility-- separateness
and hostility.

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:52.728
There's no way to really know
that, and there are a whole lot

00:59:52.728 --> 00:59:54.884
of other hypothesis why this
couldn't be the case,

00:59:54.884 --> 00:59:55.940
that everybody knew.
 

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.050
Jane Goodall had herself,
before she saw this war,

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:01.210
published a lovely book saying
how peaceful chimps were,

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:05.112
and there was all this popular
literature about how humans were

01:00:05.112 --> 01:00:06.119
rogue species.
 

01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:07.860
We're the only ones that kill
each other;

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.449
we're the only ones that go to
war,

01:00:09.449 --> 01:00:12.391
and we're really bad and it's
modern civilization or

01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:14.393
capitalism,
or imperialism,

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:19.170
or all these cultural things
that have made humans such a bad

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:23.036
species because chimps,
who are our nearest relatives,

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.409
were just so wonderful.
 

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:29.126
People were thinking of all
kinds of reasons why what they

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.699
saw was not true.
 

01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:32.702
Meanwhile the Japanese,
who were very,

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:35.628
very strong in this field,
and again females are really

01:00:35.628 --> 01:00:38.952
almost dominant in this field;
they have the patience to go

01:00:38.952 --> 01:00:41.018
there and watch for such a long
time,

01:00:41.018 --> 01:00:45.449
but there's this--even in--both
in America and Japan,

01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:48.909
and England,
the female researchers are some

01:00:48.909 --> 01:00:50.440
of the very best.
 

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.338
They again, they observed a
group--the Japanese were in a

01:00:54.338 --> 01:00:56.219
different part of Africa.
 

01:00:56.219 --> 01:01:00.489
For ten years nothing but
peace, then during the second

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:02.724
decade,
so years ten to 20,

01:01:02.724 --> 01:01:06.300
all six adult males of the
smaller community--

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.197
they also had several
communities--containing 22

01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:11.110
members, vanished one by one.
 

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:13.594
Apparently due to the
aggression by males of the other

01:01:13.594 --> 01:01:16.313
two much larger neighboring
communities which were dominant

01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:20.514
because of their size,
size in the case meaning number

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:22.030
of adult males.
 

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:25.829
Now in this case they didn't
kill the females,

01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:30.224
but one after another the
females of the annihilated

01:01:30.224 --> 01:01:35.481
community transferred with their
offspring to the victorious M

01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:41.170
group and the M group also got
control of K group's territory.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.539
Now the exception to this
transfer of the females with the

01:01:44.539 --> 01:01:47.969
young is that the adolescent
males were not allowed to--

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:51.489
did not transfer and probably
were not allowed to transfer,

01:01:51.489 --> 01:01:54.420
and they just basically stayed
in the old territory and wasted

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.679
away and died without their
social community.

01:01:56.679 --> 01:02:00.974
All the adult males were dead,
and the females had transferred

01:02:00.974 --> 01:02:04.989
to other troops and they
apparently weren't allowed in.

01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:07.780
Now is this--just sort of
random violence,

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.942
I mean it takes three years and
there are a fair number of

01:02:09.942 --> 01:02:12.010
attacks,
but it wasn't like every week

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.730
they had another battle,
so it was sporadic.

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:19.347
Is this just sort of casual
violence or was there some kind

01:02:19.347 --> 01:02:21.099
of planning in this?
 

01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:29.480
Let me cut to the chase here,
so usually chimps--there are

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:37.420
many examples of this but we
only have time for one.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.659
Usually the chimpanzees,
when they sleep at night,

01:02:39.659 --> 01:02:42.045
the males will get together and
not like one tree and they

01:02:42.045 --> 01:02:43.663
next--
they make nests up in the

01:02:43.663 --> 01:02:46.639
trees, but within a reasonable
distance so they can call to

01:02:46.639 --> 01:02:48.775
each other,
and they call to each other

01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:51.811
before they go to sleep,
to know, 'where have you built

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.360
a nest; where are we all.'
 

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.570
They're usually fairly noisy
about that.

01:02:56.570 --> 01:03:00.268
One night, Mariko Hasegawa,
a Japanese woman scientist,

01:03:00.268 --> 01:03:04.105
was observing them and she
noticed and quite startlingly,

01:03:04.105 --> 01:03:06.159
there was no pant hooting.
 

01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:11.210
They weren't making any noise,
and she had never experienced

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.409
that before.
 

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:15.648
She was surprised,
and the next morning the troop

01:03:15.648 --> 01:03:19.090
got up and started attacking a
neighboring troop.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:22.402
They singled out a mother and
her infant and attacked and

01:03:22.402 --> 01:03:23.230
killed them.
 

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:25.184
Why were they silent the
previous night,

01:03:25.184 --> 01:03:26.889
which she had never seen
before?

01:03:26.889 --> 01:03:29.954
It looks like not only each
individual was planning but it

01:03:29.954 --> 01:03:31.030
was a group thing.
 

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:35.851
No one in the group was making
any noise, so this had somehow

01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:39.869
been decided as a group effort
the night before.

01:03:39.869 --> 01:03:42.840
When they're going to attack,
several males together will

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.865
leave the core of their range
and travel clearly purposely

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:49.050
toward the periphery rather than
just wandering around,

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.860
and I'll tell you a little bit
about the wandering.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.831
It really has all the aspects
of being planned ahead and

01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:02.077
purposive and this is really
something that they planned to

01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:02.710
do.
 

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:04.949
The purpose of this violence is
not at all clear.

01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:08.018
There's contending schools
about this.

01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:11.710
The most obvious one is they
get more territory and therefore

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.739
they get more trees,
more food.

01:04:13.739 --> 01:04:17.969
They live largely on fruit and
largely figs,

01:04:17.969 --> 01:04:20.320
there's a lot of figs trees in
all jungles,

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.775
and so they just wander around
and find a fruit tree and then

01:04:23.775 --> 01:04:27.059
depending on how much fruit
there is they either go up and

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:30.690
eat themselves or they can call
over someone else and say,

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.710
'Hey I found a good fruit tree.'
 

01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:36.039
Most of the time the chimps
have no problem finding food.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:41.788
Jane Goodall had one of her
workers follow an adult male for

01:04:41.788 --> 01:04:43.664
50 days--
never out of sight,

01:04:43.664 --> 01:04:45.230
and one of the things they
noticed,

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:47.510
did he ever go looking for food?
 

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.889
In this 50 days,
never did he try to hunt food.

01:04:49.889 --> 01:04:53.030
He would just sort of wander
through the jungle,

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.061
and every so often his foot
would step on a rotting fruit

01:04:56.061 --> 01:04:58.503
and squish,
and he would notice it and look

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.570
up and there's a tree full of
fruit,

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.369
and climb up and eat and maybe
call over some others.

01:05:04.369 --> 01:05:10.416
She was definitely of the
impression that food is not a

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:13.440
limiting factor for that.
 

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.583
Later, Ann Pusey,
another scientist,

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:18.525
came to the opposite
conclusion, that she noticed

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:22.139
there's some sort of dominance
hierarchy among females.

01:05:22.139 --> 01:05:25.143
Those females would have more
fruity trees and where they

01:05:25.143 --> 01:05:27.465
ranged,
do better reproductively,

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.288
and Richard Wrangham,
who you'll read some of his

01:05:30.288 --> 01:05:32.469
stuff, he's a food man so
there's a whole group--

01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:37.259
I'm not wildly convinced by the
evidence but I'm not in the

01:05:37.259 --> 01:05:37.920
field.
 

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.639
There's a big thought that food
limitation is important.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.425
For instance,
the difference between Bonobos

01:05:45.425 --> 01:05:49.505
and chimps has been ascribed to
food density and the size of the

01:05:49.505 --> 01:05:51.190
parties, and so forth.
 

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:55.385
One the problems with the food
idea is that they have fairly

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.663
large territories,
and the young,

01:05:57.663 --> 01:06:01.219
healthy adults can basically
always find food.

01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:03.018
They never seem to starve to
death.

01:06:03.018 --> 01:06:06.929
It's the older individuals who
are quite sick and not so motile

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:09.579
that seem to have trouble
finding food,

01:06:09.579 --> 01:06:12.646
and they can get in trouble in
the dry season when there's a

01:06:12.646 --> 01:06:13.530
lot less fruit.
 

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.204
They're probably too weak
to--even when they have

01:06:16.204 --> 01:06:19.193
Territory A,
they're too weak to even--they

01:06:19.193 --> 01:06:21.849
just can barely search Territory
A,

01:06:21.849 --> 01:06:23.539
and if you give them twice as
big a territory,

01:06:23.539 --> 01:06:28.260
it may not do them any good
because they just don't have the

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.260
energy to go search it.
 

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:36.166
I think the field is moving
toward the idea that food is the

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.969
important thing.
 

01:06:37.969 --> 01:06:41.786
The evidence that I've seen
doesn't convince me yet,

01:06:41.786 --> 01:06:45.530
but again, I'm not an expert in
this whatsoever.

01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:47.989
The other purpose of course is
to acquire females.

01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.900
I've been going on and on about
how rare an egg is,

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.860
and so you'd think that's the
obvious reason,

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.570
but then you watch them go and
they kill the females,

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.360
even the females in estrus,
so that doesn't make a lot of

01:06:59.360 --> 01:06:59.760
sense.
 

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.867
Although in the Japanese group,
sometimes the females do

01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:03.489
transfer.
 

01:07:03.489 --> 01:07:05.820
The story there is quite
interesting,

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.190
because as you know,
small groups of individuals,

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:12.710
if they interbreed,
if the group was sealed,

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:15.525
if the males are sealed and
they stay together in this one

01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:18.275
community like forever,
generation after generation--if

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:20.980
the females also stayed there,
it would be an inbreeding group.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.159
Inbreeding gives big genetic
problems,

01:07:24.159 --> 01:07:28.449
so all species have to have
some mechanism of gene flow,

01:07:28.449 --> 01:07:31.360
and they have to get genes in
from the outside and/or send

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.280
their genes out.
 

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.717
It turns out that in
chimpanzees the females have

01:07:35.717 --> 01:07:40.231
access to other troops and they
go out and have intercourse when

01:07:40.231 --> 01:07:41.449
they're away.
 

01:07:41.449 --> 01:07:44.809
Exactly how this is done
because the males watch them

01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:48.684
when they come into estrus--they
must disappear before coming

01:07:48.684 --> 01:07:51.139
into estrus and have it out
there.

01:07:51.139 --> 01:07:53.878
It's not really known,
but now they can do the

01:07:53.878 --> 01:07:57.530
genetics and again something
like half of the babies are born

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:00.815
with fathers that are not from
the troop where they are

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:03.501
resident,
and very often the adolescent

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:06.219
females will just transfer
troops altogether.

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:08.907
It's very interesting,
when a female tries to

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:12.452
transfer, go into another group,
if she's never had a young

01:08:12.452 --> 01:08:14.469
she's almost always accepted.
 

01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:16.710
If she's had a young,
if she's not--

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:20.819
if she's already really in this
group because she's had a

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.747
young--
very often attacked or even

01:08:22.747 --> 01:08:24.260
killed,
or kicked out,

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.934
so there's something for some
reason that's not understood at

01:08:28.934 --> 01:08:29.479
all.
 

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:34.622
A virgin female basically is
much more acceptable for

01:08:34.622 --> 01:08:39.565
transfer then an older female
and that's not really

01:08:39.565 --> 01:08:41.050
understood.
 

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:46.590
That means since the females
are going to move around anyway,

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.350
and biologically and socially
it has to be that way,

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:52.909
it doesn't make a lot of sense
that they're doing this for--

01:08:52.909 --> 01:08:56.859
to get extra females.
 

01:08:56.859 --> 01:09:02.420
There's a lot of unknowns here.
 

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.925
Let me summarize this by--the
summary of the chimpanzee social

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:07.590
system.
 

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:11.876
The--come back to the question,
why do the males--why does the

01:09:11.876 --> 01:09:15.180
Alpha male not dominate totally
to sexuality?

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.310
The reason is that these groups
fight each other.

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:20.145
A lot of--we don't really know
the reason why they fight but

01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:23.029
they fight each other and the
winner is always the group--

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:27.167
so far--always the group that
has the most adult males and the

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.627
group that is the attacking
group basically takes no

01:09:30.627 --> 01:09:34.369
casualties whatsoever,
so having a lot of adult males

01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:35.578
is very important.
 

01:09:35.578 --> 01:09:39.037
If an Alpha male got so
aggressive that he kicked out

01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:42.029
all the other males,
he wouldn't last long.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:44.939
The other communities would
come in and annihilate him.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:48.439
Because of this fighting
between the communities,

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:52.185
the males have to stay
together, and once the males

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:56.680
have to stay together that means
they're going to compete for

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.578
females.
 

01:09:57.578 --> 01:10:02.359
If the competition was such
that only the Alpha reproduced,

01:10:02.359 --> 01:10:06.051
then evolution would push all
the other males into some other

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:09.235
strategy,
as we've seen the big and the

01:10:09.235 --> 01:10:12.189
small orangutans,
and you're going to read about

01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:13.899
a whole variety of sexual
strategies.

01:10:13.899 --> 01:10:17.408
You think there's heterosexual
and homosexual.

01:10:17.408 --> 01:10:19.110
No, there's lots of different
versions which you will read

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.350
about.
 

01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.479
Evolution would push the other
males to fight all the time --

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:25.729
if they were not reproducing
they would then be pushed by

01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:29.211
evolution to either fight all
the time with the Alpha male or

01:10:29.211 --> 01:10:32.810
go away and try to start their
own troop, or do something.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.115
That it's not a stable
situation when only one

01:10:35.115 --> 01:10:37.729
individual can reproduce and
everyone else can't.

01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:41.358
The males have to compete with
each other, all the males have

01:10:41.358 --> 01:10:44.020
to have some chance of fathering
children.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.979
This also has many subsidiary
advantages,

01:10:46.979 --> 01:10:50.109
so every male thinks he could
be the father of any of the

01:10:50.109 --> 01:10:53.029
young in the troop,
so they're all very protective.

01:10:53.029 --> 01:10:57.359
Once it was seen that a mother
was coming back into estrus and

01:10:57.359 --> 01:11:01.524
becoming sexually interested,
the Alpha male who was with her

01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:03.970
was about to start copulating
with her.

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:07.283
Her young, who did not want
to--evolutionarily generally

01:11:07.283 --> 01:11:09.858
doesn't want a brother,
because he wants all the

01:11:09.858 --> 01:11:11.538
resources and attention of the
mother,

01:11:11.538 --> 01:11:14.689
he gets in between them,
and starts fighting,

01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:17.310
and in fact he bites the
scrotum of the Alpha male,

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.810
this little tyke.
 

01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:21.920
It really clearly is sub--not
even adolescent yet.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.779
What does the Alpha male do?
 

01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:28.317
He stops, looks at him,
bends down, very gently picks

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.242
him up, takes him over here,
plops him down,

01:11:31.242 --> 01:11:33.420
and goes back to the mother.
 

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.020
Because even though when that
infant was born,

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.859
that Alpha male was not the
Alpha, so it's probably someone

01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:41.096
else's--
it might have been his,

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:45.050
so this uncertainty of
paternity is what the male--

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:50.368
all the males protect all of
the young.

01:11:50.368 --> 01:11:52.707
Because there's males,
the males fight for this

01:11:52.707 --> 01:11:56.136
dominance,
the males get bigger than the

01:11:56.136 --> 01:11:59.645
females,
and then they can coerce the

01:11:59.645 --> 01:12:02.654
females,
and so I think--and that's why

01:12:02.654 --> 01:12:05.845
you see all this --
not only male on male violence

01:12:05.845 --> 01:12:09.375
but male on female violence,
so I think the story does in

01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:13.082
the end fit back together,
but the driving force seems to

01:12:13.082 --> 01:12:16.569
be the fight between the
different groups of males,

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:18.029
which require males.
 

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:22.881
They've got to evolve a social
situation in which a lot of

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:27.310
males competing with each other
can hang together.

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.006
It's an interesting thing,
that it's because the battles

01:12:30.006 --> 01:12:31.868
between the males are not
decisive--

01:12:31.868 --> 01:12:35.067
the Alpha doesn't kill the
other--it's because the battles

01:12:35.067 --> 01:12:38.041
between the males are not
decisive that the males then

01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:40.788
turn on the females to do
violence with them.

01:12:40.788 --> 01:12:44.806
Next time we will start on
humans and we will describe

01:12:44.806 --> 01:12:49.128
humans, and you will make up
your own minds on how much of

01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:52.010
this is relevant to humans or
not.

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:53.250
See you on Tuesday.

00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:03.761
(ethereal chime plays)

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.190
- As we try to figure out what Ukraine is,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.270
we're also trying to figure out

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.460
what the countries around Ukraine are.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.340
And so over the course of this semester,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
you'll have occasion to
think about what Russia is.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.430
That's not our main subject, but I assume

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.430
it's come to mind already that Russia

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.850
is also not simple, and
that the history of Russia

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.120
is also not straightforward.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
And that indeed this
war that's going on now

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.569
may have more to do with
uncertainty about what Russia is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.587
than it does with uncertainty
about what Ukraine is.

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.220
Just something to think about.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.280
Professor Bushkovitch,
our outstanding historian

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.260
of early modern Russia,
was going to lecture

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
on the formation of the
Russian state on Tuesday,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.670
but he can't.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.530
So I'm gonna do it instead.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.423
The lecture is going to happen.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.540
You're going to see, in this lecture,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.020
that something like the
beginning of a Russian state

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.310
will start to appear.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.900
And I want you to track that,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.263
because the chronology of
all this is very important.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.320
This is partly on my mind
because of where we are,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.570
in fact, where we are in
the war, which is that,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.099
as I'm sure most of you know,

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.245
the Russian Federation
has begun a mobilization

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.610
under the heading partial mobilization,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.870
whatever that might mean.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.840
But the edict in question
essentially allows

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.960
any Russian male to be mobilized for war.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.970
And now people in Russia
are being mobilized for war

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.540
all over the country, but
notably, and not surprisingly,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
in Asian Russia and in Southern Russia,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.010
in places where people are poor,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.440
or also in places where
people are ethnically,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.720
as we say today, not Russian.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.510
Which is a reminder that one
of the things that Russia is,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.040
is an Asian state.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.850
Most of the territory of Russia
is in fact in Asia, right?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.330
And so, when Russia invaded Ukraine,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.790
many of the soldiers who were invaded,

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.280
many of the casualties
were themselves Asians.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.263
I just mentioned that
because it's gonna be helpful

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:16.020
in the next lecture when
we try to think about

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.610
what Russia is and how it
is or isn't like Ukraine.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.540
Okay.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.130
The first point I wanted to make today,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.130
as we move from Rus' to Lithuania,
is again about language.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.060
I want you to remember
that languages and peoples

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.980
are not exactly the same thing.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.930
There's a modern fantasy which says that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.640
there's one language,
and there's one people,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.260
and it's all the same thing.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.330
That often goes under the
heading of nationalism,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.820
or ethnic nationalism, or ethnicity,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.080
but languages are there
for you, and you can move

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
in and out of languages,
especially when you are young.

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:58.650
Hey, multilingual guys, stop
making jokes, stop whispering.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.950
They're all like, we
speak a lot of languages.

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:04.590
I'm sure your TFs have been like that.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.103
They've probably been like,

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:07.050
what languages do you guys speak?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.060
Right, have they done that in section?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.520
They have in fact done that in section.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.780
I'm not surprised.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.394
Okay, but actually, you know, I mean,

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:20.640
for Wiktor and for Maksimas,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.023
the language that they're teaching you in

00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:24.480
is a language that
they've moved into, right?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.560
It's not their language of birth.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.570
It's a language that they've moved into.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.580
And the capacity for of humans to do this

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.620
is very important in politics,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.390
especially in non-modern politics.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.150
So when we're talking about this fellow,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Volodymyr or Vladimir, or
Valdemar, as his Scandinavian was,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.570
we're talking about the fellow
who converted to Christianity

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.880
and in some sense began
the whole statehood project

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.713
that we're concerned with.

00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:50.703
He's a Scandinavian prince, right?

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.400
He's from Scandinavia, his
family's from Scandinavia.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.861
His successors even will
still be Scandinavian princes.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.130
And his name is Waldemar.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.990
And then he had, but there
are these nice Slavic

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.340
versions of his name.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.620
Today we say Volodymyr and Vladimir,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.240
but those names in turn seem
to come from Bulgaria, right?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.340
So there's a Bulgarian Vladimir.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.380
So is he a Scandinavian prince?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.390
Is he a Bulgarian prince?

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.330
And this gets us thinking
in the right directions,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.150
because he's not any one thing, right?

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.260
The way to come to power,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.690
and very often the way
to stay in power, again,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.880
especially in the earlier periods,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.560
is to be more than one thing,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.150
to speak more than one language.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.720
So if we think about Valdemar,
or Vladimir, or Volodymyr,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.640
we're right to think about the Vikings,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.890
but we're also right to
think about the Bulgarians,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.780
and we're right to think
about the Byzantines.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.840
When he converted the
Christianity, he took another name,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.590
which is Basil, that was
his baptismal name, Basil.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.020
It's notable that he didn't
make that his main name,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.990
that he stated his main
name remained Volodymyr.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.120
So people come into languages.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.950
Languages are there, you
can move through them,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
you can do things with them.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.490
So when I was in Ukraine the last time,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.200
which is a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.080
I was speaking to someone
who was called Volodymyr.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.270
And you know, that Volodymyr Zelenskyy,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.350
he's also someone who's
coming into a language, right?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.300
Ukrainian was not his best language

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.670
when he was elected president of Ukraine.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.550
But now of course it's
his public language.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.220
And just even I can
tell that his Ukrainian

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.030
is much better now than it
was a couple of years ago.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.490
And when I spoke to his
wife, Elena Zelenskyy,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.110
she's also, we spoke Ukrainian.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.120
And I think I made her feel
good because my Ukrainian

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.020
was just, you know, I made mistakes.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.992
And I think that put her at ease.

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:40.230
But you know it's cute, I made mistakes.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.146
Mistakes are cute.

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:43.380
An old guy making mistakes is cute.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.324
It's like one of the
many advantages we have.

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:49.623
But she was coming into a language,

00:05:49.623 --> 00:05:51.300
like I was coming into a language, right?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.656
Ukrainian is not, I was
speaking Ukrainian with her.

00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:54.720
Ukrainian is not my
language of birth, right?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.730
It's like fourth or fifth best language.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.410
I was coming into a
language in a different way

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.840
she's coming into a language, right?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.250
You can come into languages.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.507
Another related theme is that Volodymyr,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.270
Waldemar, is coming into a religion.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.450
So a conversion is a
kind of sideways move.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.750
You don't really stop being a pagan

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.580
when you become a Christian,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.254
it's not that your whole past disappears,

00:06:23.254 --> 00:06:26.970
it's that you're moving into
something which already exists

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.950
and brings with it certain features.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.630
In this case, it brings with it priests,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.300
it brings with it another
language, of church Slavonic.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.923
It brings with it a tradition.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.740
It brings with it a heritage,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.980
because the moment that you
convert into Christianity,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.322
you're inheriting the Bible,

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:48.180
and so hence the history of the Jews,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.290
a very ancient history.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.260
Like you're not putting yourself
into that timeline as well.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.880
Because you're going into Greek,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.040
you're also going into the tradition

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.396
of the ancient Mediterranean
world that way.

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:01.500
Suddenly you're in all of
these vertical traditions

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.750
that you weren't in before.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.710
Okay, so we're gonna get
from, in this lecture,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.950
we're gonna get from
Volodymyr to Yaroslav,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.010
and then we're gonna get
from Yaroslav to Lithuania.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.950
We're gonna end in Lithuania,
much the joy of our,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.653
I'm counting them, three
Lithuanians in this group.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.970
So the two great leaders of Rus',

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.614
if you just read like a
textbook about early Rus',

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:28.920
are going to be Volodymyr and Yaroslav.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.370
And we have, so first we
have to get to Yaroslav.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.080
It's complicated.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.071
Okay, I mean, I could say
Volodymyr was Yaroslav's son,

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.890
and that would make it sound very simple,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.690
but it's not really simple at all.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.040
As you remember last time,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.480
when Volodymyr took Ana,
the Byzantine princess Ana,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.480
as his wife, he already had
about six others and, you know,

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:55.983
a harem of hundreds of women.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.940
When he died, so his
relationship with his sons

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.140
was not straightforward.

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:05.490
When he died in 1015,
he had one of his sons,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.170
and I tried to write all
these down this time.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.340
He had one of his son's,
Sviatopolk, in prison, as one does,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.690
he was making war against another
one of his sons, Yaroslav,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.980
as one does.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.980
So when Volodymyr dies,
Sviatopolk is freed.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.790
Sviatopolk then arranges for, it seems,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.250
the death of three of his brothers,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.730
probably with the help
of Scandinavian allies.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.730
Sviatopolk then goes to
war against Yaroslav.

00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:45.348
Yaroslav initially wins,
with the help of some

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.780
Scandinavian allies, at
least that's according to

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.920
the tale of Evalynd, which
is an Icelandic saga,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.990
which reminds you how this is all this,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.360
this could all be Nordic
history, by the way.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.970
We could be in a Nordic
history class at this point,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.040
the history of Rus' at this point

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.069
fits in with the history of what's,

00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:06.930
as Rus' is becoming a state,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.950
so simultaneously are Norway
and Sweden becoming states.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.910
It's a simultaneous, and it's
an intermingled, process.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.320
So Sviatopolk is freed, but
then he's defeated by Yaroslav.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.710
Then Sviatopolk goes to
Poland, and gets an army,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.820
and brings it back.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.910
He's married to a Polish princess.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.570
He brings a Polish army back,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.570
he defeats Yaroslav, Yaroslav goes east,

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.070
recruits an army of Pechenegs, comes back,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.903
defeats Sviatopolk.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.575
Seems that Yaroslav is now in charge,

00:09:40.575 --> 00:09:43.590
but then yet another brother,
there were at least 10.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.180
I'm sure there were many, many more,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.010
but there are 10 that come down to us.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.950
And then another brother
was called Mstislav,

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.190
which means something like
glory to revenge, beautifully.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.991
Mstislav marches on Kyiv
and defeats Yaroslav.

00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:59.550
As a result of this in the end,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.420
Mstislav and Yaroslav rule
Kyiv together for a while.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.620
Mstislav about a decade.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.600
Mstislav dies in 1036, and
from 1036 Yaroslav rules alone.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.580
Okay, I give you those details because

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.940
the colorful details from
all of the Scandinavian sagas

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.130
in the early Kyiv of sources
are very interesting,

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.440
but also because I want
you to see a problem,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.960
which is the problem of succession,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.090
how you get from one ruler to another,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.470
how you keep a state going.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.050
This is a key problem in political theory,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.780
in political practice,
which you wanna mark.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.130
Because even if you're just thinking about

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.860
contemporary politics,
like why, for example,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.890
are things so chaotic in the
Russian Federation right now?

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.290
One of the first things
that you should try out is,

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.210
what's the succession principle?

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.090
How do they know who the
next ruler is going to be?

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.923
That's it.

00:10:45.923 --> 00:10:49.560
So in early Rus', there was a
big problem with succession.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.210
If you count it the way we're counting it,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.490
from one ruler to another single ruler,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.273
from Volodymyr to
Yaroslav, it took 21 years.

00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:01.360
And along the way, at least

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.500
10 of the other children of
of Volodymyr were killed.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.170
Okay, also I want you to
mark succession as an issue

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.560
because when we get into
other kinds of regimes

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.460
in a couple of weeks,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.050
the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.600
the Russian empire,
succession is also going to be

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.565
a very important issue there.

00:11:20.565 --> 00:11:23.790
This brings us to Yaroslav
and what is regarded

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.130
as the golden age of Kyivan Rus'.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.090
His rule, which is the
1020s, 1030s, 1040s.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.090
He rules by himself from
1036 until his death in 1054.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.310
So Yaroslav is also a Scandinavian prince.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.930
I wanna make sure this is clear.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.700
The fact that he's a Scandinavian prince

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.016
doesn't mean that he's not
the prince of Rus', right?

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:49.980
But he is a Scandinavian prince.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.280
He's in the saga of Harald Hardrada,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.559
who is the king of Norway.

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:57.690
And he marries off one of his daughters

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.180
to that same king of Norway.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.180
He himself is married to a
daughter of the king of Sweden.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.190
As I've already said, some
of the sources about him

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.630
are Icelandic sagas.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.540
And by the way, Iceland
sagas are the earliest

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.809
significant European literature.

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:17.250
They're quite extraordinary,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.810
but they're also interesting
historical sources

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.430
because they record
events that are only about

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.280
one or 200 years before
when they were recorded,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.140
and they're based on oral tradition.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.390
So they're pretty good
comparatively speaking

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.025
to historical sources.

00:12:29.025 --> 00:12:31.320
And, oh, he also married one of his,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.720
So Yaroslav also married
one of his own daughters

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.790
to the king of Norway, right?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.040
So we're very, here, connected

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.340
to the history of Scandinavia.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.830
And it's inconceivable
that he didn't speak

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.840
whatever we wanna call
the Swedish language,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.513
or whatever we wanna call it at that time.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.500
He did marry another one of his daughters,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.610
this is just something we have to know.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.770
He did marry one of his other daughters

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.280
to the king of France,
which is a fun fact,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.080
which every Ukrainian
needs for you to know.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.780
So we're gonna make sure
that it's in this class.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.330
That would be Yaroslav's favorite daughter

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.260
who was called Ana, who was
remembered as Anne of Kyiv.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.000
Because from the point of view of Paris,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.179
she was Anne of Kyiv.

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.591
She, in the middle of the 11th century,

00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:19.080
she was the queen of France.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.150
She was the one who
went to Paris and said,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.510
compared to Kyiv, this is
kind of dingy and pathetic

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.620
and wanted to go back.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.593
So now you know, that's Anne of Kyiv.

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:34.200
So Yaroslav is a Scandinavian prince,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.200
but he is also an inheritor
of Byzantine Christianity

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.130
from his father.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.010
And he is also the ruler of
a Slavic speaking population.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.960
So it's like there's a triangle.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.530
So on the Byzantine side
of the triangle, he builds,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.613
or maybe he completes
the church of San Sophia,

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:58.560
which is the central cathedral in Kyiv,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.760
which still exists.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.480
It exists in a kind in a kind
of Baroque reconstruction,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.580
but which still exists and was completed

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.970
somewhere around the 1030s.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.450
And it was modeled on Hagiya
Sophia in Constantinople.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.400
So the main cathedral
in Kyiv was modeled on

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.090
the main cathedral in Constantinople.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.880
So he's balancing that.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.870
With that church came
Greek speaking priests.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.743
The first priests who came
to convert the population

00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:29.902
were from Constantinople.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.790
They spoke Greek.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.940
And with these Greek priests,
and with the conversion

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.710
came a certain model of order,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.979
which might seem
intuitive to a lot of you.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.570
It seems so natural, perhaps because

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.640
it's now more or less hegemonic,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.100
but it had to arrive at a certain point,

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.742
which is the days of the week.

00:14:48.742 --> 00:14:52.053
The days of the week and the
idea that the day of rest

00:14:52.053 --> 00:14:56.340
is the seventh day, Sunday.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.540
Churches and churchyards
come with Christianity.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.870
The idea that you bury your
dead, as I mentioned before,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.300
rather than cremate
comes with Christianity.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.040
That you bury them in a certain place,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.370
a cemetery in a churchyard,
comes with Christianity.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.620
So there's a civilizational package,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.360
which comes with the Greek priests.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.260
But interestingly, it is
Yaroslav who shifts over

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:24.260
from Greek priests to local,
Slavic speaking priests.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.680
In the year 1051, he
manages to have appointed,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.220
or appoints himself, as the
local head of the church,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.330
the metropolitan, a man called Helarion,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.660
who was a local Slav and not a Greek.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.270
And somewhere around this time as well,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.890
and this is crucial, the
language of the liturgy

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:51.890
gets changed from Greek
to old church Slavonic.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.277
So in other words,

00:15:56.277 --> 00:15:59.670
there's a big difference
between going to church

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.180
and hearing a language that
you can't understand at all,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.130
to going to church and hearing a language

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.160
where you can understand
a little bit, right?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.650
So that's basically the shift from Greek

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.660
to old church Slavonic.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.390
Geek, from the point of view of Kyiv,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.920
is a foreign language.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.660
Very few people speak Greek.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.410
They're mostly people who have
arrived from Constantinople

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.720
or Greek traders coming up and down

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.690
from the Black Sea coast,
as we've talked about,

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.220
it's basically a foreign language.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.970
And in the whole history
of the Greek church,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.400
the Orthodox church, the
Eastern church in Kyiv,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.222
relatively few people learn Greek.

00:16:38.222 --> 00:16:39.240
Some people do, but relatively few.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.060
Basically very educated
churchmen learn Greek.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.790
Old church Slavonic is a different story.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.530
You'll remember where old
church Slavonic came from.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.720
Old church Slavonic is invented
by Cyril and Methodius.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.550
It has this journey down to Bulgaria,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.710
and now it arrives in Kyiv.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.360
And it has the huge advantage
that it is a Slavic language.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.140
It is based on a Slavic language,

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.791
probably the Slavic language
that was spoken in Macedonia

00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:07.290
by the mother of Cyril and Methodius.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.600
But it's based in a Slavic language.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.930
And therefore, if you're a native speaker

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.500
of a Slavic language, you
can figure out a lot of it.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.390
So when I studied old,
I'm not a native speaker

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.910
of Slavic language, but I
studied old church Slavonic.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.450
A lot of it was intuitive to
me, a thousand years later

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.820
and with the funny glycolytic alphabet,

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.680
but a lot of it was intuitive to me.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.040
I could look at it and see a lot of it.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.820
So it's not totally impenetrable and,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.860
once you start with a Slavic language,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.420
and this is very important,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.580
you can then start to mess with it.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.250
You can then take it as a
basis of a written language.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.580
And then with time,
vernacular words will start

00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:50.297
to make their way into the language.

00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:51.775
What's the vernacular?

00:17:51.775 --> 00:17:54.480
The vernacular is the language
as we actually speak it.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.860
As we actually speak it.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.670
And so Slavic words, as
people actually spoke them,

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.940
made their way into the written language,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.240
thereby enriching it and changing it.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.360
And this language, church Slavonic,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.060
slowly becomes a written language,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.460
which is serving not just the church,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.290
but also the state.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.180
And this is hugely important because,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.870
if you're going to run a state
as distinct from a church,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.860
it's good to have law.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.850
It's good to have a language in which

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.080
you can record that law.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.290
So old church Slavonic, in
the version that it's used

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:32.970
in the Kyivan state, is usually
called Chancery Slavonic.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.220
Just to make this distinction.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.873
Chancery Slavonic.

00:18:42.067 --> 00:18:44.820
And this Chancery Slavonic is recorded in,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.100
is the language of a very important text,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.710
which seems to originate with Yaroslav,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.770
and then continues after his
time for another century or so,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.800
which is called the Ruska
Pravda, or the Russkaya Pravda,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.970
which is a collection of laws.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.740
So there's secular law now.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.150
There's secular law.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.540
Not just church custom and
church law, but secular law.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.540
And what the law itself says
is itself very revealing.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.330
So now the law becomes a
historical source for us.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.620
We don't just have sagas,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.910
we don't just have genealogies,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.678
we don't just have, you know,

00:19:21.678 --> 00:19:23.040
legends about Rus' written in Kyiv

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.390
a century after the events.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.330
We have the law, which was
applied in its own time.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.587
What we see in this law are at least two

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:31.800
very important developments.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.100
Number one, you see that
the society has shifted

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.620
from the kind of society we
talked about in the beginning,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.740
which is one where
people could be enslaved,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.290
to one in which the chief
preoccupation of people

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.980
was agriculture, and
agriculture is being regulated.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.190
So we now have a state which is based upon

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.630
people generating a
surplus in agriculture.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.360
The classic model, which
we see over and over again,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.400
beginning in Mesopotamia,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.890
the classic model, where
you can have a city,

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.440
and you can have a state
with a capital in that city,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.370
because you have rules about
how you collect a surplus

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.250
from the people who are
actually working the land.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.050
Which may be a somewhat
exploitative system,

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.390
but it's a very different
system than raiding

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.980
and slave trading.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.260
It's a very different system
than raiding and slave trading.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.960
And it describes a
relationship between a ruler

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.750
and his people, as opposed
to a relationship between

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.570
people who are just passing
through and collecting things

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.610
or people that they're going to sell

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.930
somewhere further down the river.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.880
So by the time the law is written down,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.740
that transition has been achieved

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.650
and we're in a different kind of society.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.120
Maybe even more fundamentally,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.150
what you see in the Russkaya
Pravda, the Ruska Pravda,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.160
is an attempt to make a transition

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.915
from a culture of personal revenge,

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:52.915
to a culture where disputes
are actually settled in courts.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.770
So I'm sure all of you,
you know, in your lives,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.810
depending upon where you're
from, have some familiarity,

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.610
at least from, I don't know, film,

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.540
with what I mean by personal revenge.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.580
Where I do something to your clan

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.590
and therefore your clan has
to do something to my clan,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.823
and this can go on indefinitely,
and it can be very costly

00:21:09.823 --> 00:21:11.700
and destabilizing.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.530
If you're trying to set up a state,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.420
you don't want this clan and this clan

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.360
to have a feud indefinitely, right?

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.940
If there's a dispute, like
this clan has stolen this,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.220
or this clan has burned
down that, or whatever,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.690
you want that dispute to come to me,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.580
you want the dispute to come to the court,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.170
to the state, where it can be resolved.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.420
And so one of the things
that Ruska Pravda lays down

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.731
is what the appropriate penalties are.

00:21:32.731 --> 00:21:37.731
So there's a generic penalty
rather than personal feuds,

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.223
this is the kind of thing
that builds up a state.

00:21:42.562 --> 00:21:45.840
But, I keep coming back to this,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.840
but a weakness in the state
is that it didn't have

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.543
the legal structures to allow
it to perpetuate itself,

00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:58.080
which one finds surprisingly
often is a problem with states.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.690
It's actually, it's kind of
the magic of founding a state

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.630
is how, the German sociologist Max Weber

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.950
was also obsessed with this,

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.920
how you get from the
stage of founding a state

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.930
to the stage of continuing a state.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.630
Where you might found
a state because of some

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.330
great achievement or because
of some charismatic leader,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.722
but neither the achievement
nor the charisma lasts.

00:22:17.722 --> 00:22:21.960
And so then how do you keep
the state actually going?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.430
Maybe you found institutions,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.170
these institutions sound pretty good,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.180
but how do you make sure
that people continue

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.310
to believe in them without the achievement

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.246
and the charisma somehow backing them up?

00:22:32.246 --> 00:22:34.860
In then you event, how can
you do it without a procedure?

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.070
So, in Kyiv, when we
talk about Kyivan Rus,

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.510
we're talking about a range
of lands, going to the east,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.090
going to the north,
going a bit to the south

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.350
and west of Kyiv.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.600
We're talking about not
just Kyiv and Ukraine today,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.246
we're talking about what's now Belarus

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.550
and what's now a lot of European Russia.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.300
All the way up to a bit to
the east of what's now Moscow.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.150
And these various
districts were passed out

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.360
to the various sons in an
extremely confusing order,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.523
which honestly no one has figured out.

00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:08.370
And one suspects it changed
from generation to generation,

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.230
or sometimes that they
were just making it up.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.830
And if we don't know it, I
think it's forgivable because

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.020
whatever the rules were, the brothers

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.720
were constantly fighting each other.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.430
And if they were constantly
fighting each other,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.110
it means that whatever the rules were,

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.660
maybe they were contested, or not clear,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.030
or maybe not taken always seriously.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:31.410
So the rulers in Kyiv passed
out the various districts

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.020
to their sons, and there was
an idea that a certain son

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.730
at some point would
become the ruler of Kyiv

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.140
and will be superior to all the others,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.330
but that never panned out the way that

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.560
it was supposed to be.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.950
So after Yaroslav's death in 1054,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.200
we essentially have one long confusing

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.043
series of succession crises
until the Mongols come in 1241.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.890
There are however, at
least one moment in here

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.630
which I want you to mark,

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.500
which is the rise of a
city called Vladimir,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.090
not the person, the city.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.500
And we're gonna call it
Vladimir and not Volodymyr

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.800
because this city is all the way out in

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.317
the far Eastern extreme of Rus',

00:24:14.317 --> 00:24:17.430
a little bit to the east
of where Moscow now is.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.543
I say now, because Moscow
didn't exist at the time.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:27.470
Vladimir, the city, was
ruled in the 1160s, 1170s

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.470
by a man called Andrey Bogolyubsky,

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.560
who I think is on your list,
should be on your list.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.830
And he attacked Kyiv, not once, but twice.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.510
The first time he successfully sacked it.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.390
The second time he was repulsed.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.780
But the point is that Andrey Bogolyubsky

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.110
had the idea that he
was gonna make Vladimir

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.590
the most important city, the
successor of Kyiv, as it were.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.200
He took an important
icon that was near Kyiv,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.000
and he brought it to Vladimir.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.620
He built a church in Vladimir,

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.280
which was meant to look
like St. Sophia in Kyiv.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.800
So he had the idea that he would
be the most important ruler

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.760
and that his city would be
more important than Kyiv.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.093
So this is Vladimir, and
Vladimir is in a district

00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:14.583
which is called Suzdal.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.420
The Mongols are going to come,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.010
they're going to wipe out Vladimir,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.300
they're gonna wipe out Suzdal,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.920
they're gonna wipe out
basically everything

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.570
in that part of Rus.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.000
But I want you to at
least mark that this idea

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.760
was already here in the 12th century,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.710
that there could be a successor to Kyiv

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.230
that could somehow be better than Kyiv.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.460
Okay.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.980
When the Mongols do come,
and we'll talk more about

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.330
the Mongols and what they were up to,

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.040
but when the Mongols do come,
we see a partition of Rus,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.020
which is very durable.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.280
I'll just say a word about the Mongols

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.522
and what they were up to.

00:25:51.522 --> 00:25:52.803
Just a word.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.040
It is always the case that
from the point of view

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.040
of the people whose cities get sacked,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.090
that the arriving people
are just marauders,

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.650
and chaotic and so on,

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.650
but it is almost always
the case that, in fact,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.720
what is happening is that
those who are arriving

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.820
are trying to establish trade routes,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.890
admittedly on terms favorable to them.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.390
And you tend to get, I mean,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.670
this is why we now have a
European Union to avoid this,

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.010
but the way you get terms favorable to you

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.480
is you sack the city.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.090
And then you get terms favorable to you.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.010
I mean, it's tough, but that's how it is.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.100
So the Mongols, like
the Vikings before them,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.620
were trying to establish
a long trade route,

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.170
the Vikings over sea,
the Mongols over land,

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.080
in which they would be
able to trade favorably

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.370
all the way down the line

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.470
at terms which are favorable to them.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.760
At terms which are favorable to them.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.120
And they had tremendous success with this

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.170
everywhere they went.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.690
They were never really defeated.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.980
In the early 1240s, they
destroy what remains

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.510
of Kyivan Rus'.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.700
You understand that when
they destroy Kyivan Rus',

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.800
they're not destroying a unified state,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.600
because there is no unified state.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.222
There are a bunch of
districts with rivals.

00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:08.222
When the princes of Rus'
go out to meet the Mongols

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.880
on the battlefield, they're literally

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.390
arguing amongst one another
on the way to the battlefield

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.100
about who is who, and
who gets to go first,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:17.970
and who's the most important.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.953
So that gives you a sense.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.920
Even if they'd have been
in perfect formation,

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.390
had loved one another, they still would've

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.220
had their hats handed them
by the Mongols, however.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.960
The Mongols were gonna win.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.000
So after the Mongol invasion,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.210
we get a kind of three part division

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.000
of the lands of old Rus,
which I'm gonna mark.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.640
And then we're gonna talk about
the most important of these,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.380
which is Lithuania.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.180
So, far off to the west
you have a district

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.157
called Galicia-Volhynia.

00:27:47.157 --> 00:27:49.890
And that district, Galicia-Volhynia,

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.960
is going to have a slightly
different trajectory

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.430
than the rest, because Galicia-Volhynia

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.580
is gonna be ruled by its
own princes for a while.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.490
And then the Galician
part of Galicia-Volhynia

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.420
is gonna become part of Poland
in the mid 14th century.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.820
So that Western part of Ukraine,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.890
Galicia-Volhynia, is going to have

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.940
a somewhat different history.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.293
That's part one.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.983
Part two, so that's the extreme west,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.833
part two is the extreme east
or the extreme Northeast.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.210
Suzdal, the areas around what is gonna be

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.230
at some point, Moscow.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.660
Moscow has still not come
into being, but I promise you,

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.518
at some point Moscow will be created.

00:28:29.518 --> 00:28:33.175
The territories in Suzdal in the Northeast

00:28:33.175 --> 00:28:38.175
are going to remain longer
under direct Mongol domination.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.070
That's also a different political story.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.950
The Mongols are gonna come
and they're gonna stay.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.170
And they're gonna establish a durable form

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.170
of transactional politics with the

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.570
inheritors of Rus' princes
in the far Northeast.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.280
And we'll pick up that story next time

00:28:58.221 --> 00:29:00.750
when I talk about the
origins of the state,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.230
which is based in Moscow,
the origins of Russia.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.120
The third and the most
important trajectory

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.860
is the one we're going to follow today,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.310
which is the grand Duchy of Lithuania.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.340
Most of the territory of old Rus'

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.760
comes under the grand Duchy of Lithuania.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.540
And not only that, one of
the reasons why I've spent

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.150
so much time talking about
this civilization is that,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.600
interestingly, this civilizational package

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.690
associated with Yaroslav, the language,

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.395
the Chancery Slavonic, the law

00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.980
all gets absorbed by Lithuania.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.430
The Lithuanians take it over.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.450
They appropriate it,
they make it their own

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.500
very comfortably.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.030
And so in that sense, the
Kyivan civilization survives

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.100
in the written form of its law.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.770
So it's sometimes it's
helpful to think of history

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.260
as having different speeds, or different

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.080
elements in history having
different kinds of durability.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.970
So a language has a lot of durability.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.590
It changes over time.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.520
A particular civilizational
package, like law,

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.450
it doesn't last as long as a language,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.670
but it can last much longer than a person.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.850
So the fact that Yaroslav
got the law together

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.520
has meaning, which goes
well beyond his lifetime,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.050
deep into the history of Lithuania.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.420
Centuries later, when Lithuanians

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.220
are gonna be writing their grand statutes,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.560
which starts in the 16th century,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.510
when they write their
statutes, three of them,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.930
they're gonna be using this
language, Chancery Slavonic.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.490
In turn, it's gonna have more words

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.050
from their part of the world and so on,

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.100
but this civilizational
package long outlasts

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.860
the actual Kyivan Rus'.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.887
So the last big thing we have to do,

00:30:36.887 --> 00:30:39.480
we've gotten Volodymyr to Yaroslav,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.010
Yaroslav to the end of Rus'.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.660
Now we have to get to Lithuania.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.980
What is Lithuania?

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.300
And how could Lithuania be so, I mean,

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.180
isn't Lithuania just this tiny country?

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.430
It's this tiny country
filled with Baltic speakers?

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.263
How can it?

00:30:51.263 --> 00:30:53.640
It was the biggest country
in Europe, my friends.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.670
It was the biggest country
in Europe at the time.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.700
And it emerged, as
countries often emerged,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.284
because of pressure from two directions.

00:31:02.284 --> 00:31:05.160
The Lithuanian state consolidated,

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.640
because of pressure from the west,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.860
in the form of Christianity.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.680
Now a very aggressive, pointed pressure

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.170
in the form of crusades.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.270
A few centuries earlier,
when we're talking about

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.480
the Franks, and Poland,
and Moravia, and so on,

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.160
that's a more gentle pressure.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.480
You know, we want you to convert.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.589
Perhaps you'll be a little
bit subordinate to us.

00:31:26.589 --> 00:31:31.589
We're now in the 14th century
in the era of crusades,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.440
and the Lithuanians
were subject to violent,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.930
forcible conversion.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.980
By that I mean, all the men were killed

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.800
and the women and children
were taken and baptized.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.810
That's what the Teutonic Knights did.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.480
So pressure from the west,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.790
the Teutonic Knights had
wiped out the Prussians.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.740
I realize there's still
a place called Prussia,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.560
but the place called
Prussia today takes its name

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.950
from an earlier people who
spoke a Baltic language,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.420
similar to Lithuanian.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.570
These people were exterminated
by the Teutonic Knights.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.250
They no longer existed.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.930
And as that was happening,

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.280
the groups of Baltic speakers

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.690
that are called the Lithuanians

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.940
managed to consolidate a state.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.280
So they were consolidating
because of pressure

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.113
from the west.

00:32:18.113 --> 00:32:20.790
And also, as we'll get
to, they consolidated

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.070
because of what the
Mongols did in the south.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.890
So faced with pressure from the west,

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.057
the Lithuanian state in
the early 14th century,

00:32:28.057 --> 00:32:31.200
in the 13 hundreds, was able to move south

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.860
from its base around Vilnius
into what's now Belarus,

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.836
and deep into what's now Ukraine.

00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:39.840
And so, as they were
pressed from the west,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.270
they took advantage of
what the Mongols had done

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.103
in the east.

00:32:43.103 --> 00:32:44.670
It might help, although, you know,

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.740
in the kind in a kind of Christian
dominated historiography,

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.120
this would never be put this way,

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.550
to think of the Teutonic
Knights and the Mongols

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.030
as arriving at about the
same time, which they did,

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.190
and their arrival at about the same time

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.507
creating the conditions
in which a Lithuania

00:32:58.507 --> 00:33:01.890
could face a challenge and
respond to that challenge

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.560
by gathering up
territories from the south,

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.350
from Rus, and becoming the
biggest state in Europe,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.860
which it was.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.940
So what do we know about Lithuania?

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.710
The Lithuanians, so I talked
earlier about the math,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.320
the math of slavery and paganism.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.048
The Lithuanians were the
last holdouts in this.

00:33:22.048 --> 00:33:25.110
They were the last major
pagan group in Europe.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.560
They were the last ones who
were able not to be enslaved

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.180
more than they enslaved others.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.750
They were using slave labor of
others in their countryside.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.448
They raided Rus' for slaves,
they raided Poland for slaves,

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.540
they also raided their Baltic,

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.160
their pagan neighbors for slaves.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.320
So long as they had pagan neighbors.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.270
They brought in tens
of thousands of people

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.870
to work as slaves in their agriculture.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.800
We know that they traded
timber, and furs, and grain,

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.340
and wax and honey for iron products.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.740
We know that they turned
a corner in their own

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.500
agricultural planning in
the early 14th century

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.455
under their most important ruler,

00:34:03.455 --> 00:34:06.480
who I may not have put down, Gediminas.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.650
Is he there?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.866
He's there?

00:34:08.866 --> 00:34:09.699
Okay.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.627
So under Gediminas, who
ruled from 1315 to 1343,

00:34:13.627 --> 00:34:17.280
they started moving away from slavery

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.350
and towards colonization,

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:23.100
where they would accept
the rules of local,

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.406
they would kind of control
land rather than people.

00:34:25.406 --> 00:34:28.050
So in a way it's the
same kind of transition

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.230
you see earlier in Rus', control
land, rather than people,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.930
accept basically the rules
that already existed.

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:36.184
And then try to tax.

00:34:36.184 --> 00:34:40.890
It's Gediminas who moves
into what is now Rus'.

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:42.060
What was their religion?

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.950
Very briefly about this,

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:46.590
we know a lot more about
it because their paganism

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.573
lasted for another four centuries.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:53.820
And many people had contact
with them, many Christians,

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.560
many Muslims, many Jews
had contacts with them

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.550
over the centuries.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.640
There were Christian churches
in Vilnius the whole time.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.473
Why?

00:35:00.473 --> 00:35:03.420
Because if you're a
tolerant, prosperous regime,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.430
you need to have traders
coming from other places

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.347
and you have to make sure
they have churches, right?

00:35:07.347 --> 00:35:11.898
And additionally, just to make
sure this is always clear,

00:35:11.898 --> 00:35:13.620
this story is gonna end with

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.600
the Lithuanian rulers converting,

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.930
but the Lithuanian rulers are
always ruling over a country

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.520
which is majority Christian.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.220
Because most of the people
who are in Lithuania

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.410
are in what is now Belarus, and then later

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.350
in what is now Ukraine, i.e.
they're Eastern Christians.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.320
So the whole time this is a regime where

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.440
the rulers are pagans, and the
ruling families are pagans,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.610
but most of the population
are actually Christians.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.140
So when I talk about this religion,

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.750
this is the religion of the Baltic core,

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.200
which then spreads out and
tolerates Christianity.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.203
They make no attempt at
converting the Christians at all.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.720
So we know that the grand
duke was also the high priest.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.720
We know that the priests
were priests of sacrifice,

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.540
as in the Slavic lands.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.490
We know what some of the
most important gods were,

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.900
who were familiar figures already.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.933
They had a version of Perun,
who was called Perkūnas.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.810
In general, if you just add us to the end,

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:10.980
you'll get a Lithuanian word.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.430
So like, okay, doesn't always work.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.920
Doesn't always work.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.220
But the Lithuanian version
of Perun was called Perkūnas.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.530
Other important gods were

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.960
Andai, who was associated with water,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.890
Teliavel, who was associated
with like a Hephaestus figure,

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.480
associated with the smithy.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.340
But as with the Slavic paganism,
the gods were not separate.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.310
This is much more animistic,
it's much more a religion

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:43.310
where everything is in some
sense animated by divinity.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.747
So trees were venerated.

00:36:45.747 --> 00:36:50.277
Specific groves of trees
regardless as important.

00:36:50.277 --> 00:36:52.812
In specific groves of trees,

00:36:52.812 --> 00:36:56.790
the dead would be burned as a sacrifice.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.970
Specific springs and rivers
and rocks were also important.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.690
The Lithuanians, like the
Slavs, also didn't have temples

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.390
until they made contact with Christians.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.620
And then they began to build temples,

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.620
it appears, as a kind of
borrowing from the Christians.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:17.040
We know that they divined
omens from the behavior of,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.660
some of them still do, from the behavior

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.460
of horses and snakes.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.890
We know that after
victories they sacrificed

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.550
a third of the spoils to the gods.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.590
We know that horses were
of special significance.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.618
That horse skulls were meant
to ward off evil spirits.

00:37:32.618 --> 00:37:37.500
That two horses in front of a
house, on the gable of houses,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.300
was meant to bring good fortune.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.580
We know that if you were
important and you died,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.200
you were buried with your
horse so that you would

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.680
have your horse in the next world.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.690
And Lithuanians also thoughtfully did this

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.660
to important people who they
captured on the battlefield.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:56.660
So for example, when
they were in battle with

00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:00.450
the crusaders, and they
captured important knights,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:04.470
they would thoughtfully
burn them to death,

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.243
fully armed, on horseback.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.670
That's a mark of privilege.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.880
A major Teutonic Knight
who, so the crusading wars

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.650
between the crusaders and Lithuanians

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.770
were unbelievably fierce on both sides,

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.983
and were recorded by
the crusaders that way.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.510
The conflict between the
crusaders and the Lithuanians

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.120
actually makes it into English literature

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.710
right at the very beginning.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.900
So if you've had like a high school course

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.048
in English literature, where
you were forced to read,

00:38:36.048 --> 00:38:41.048
where you happily read
Chaucer, the Canterbury Tales,

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.720
you might remember that when
the knight is introduced

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.940
as a character in the prologue,

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.650
he's described this way.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.750
A knight there was, and that a worthy man,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.150
that from the time that he
first began to riding out,

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.160
he loved chivalry, truth and
honor, freedom and courtesy

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.160
above all nations in Prus,
Prussia, in Lithau had he reysed

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.570
and in Rus.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.920
Lithau is Lithuania and
Rus' is, of course, Rus'.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.820
So the Knight in this
English story from 1380,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.220
from the 14th century, is a Crusader,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.890
but he's a Crusader in
Northeastern Europe.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.800
He's a Crusader in Lithuania.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.967
And that word, he reysed,
that's the German word, reyse.

00:39:26.967 --> 00:39:30.360
And reyse, in this particular
context, every year

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.520
the Teutonic Knights declared
that there was a reyse,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.950
which meant that all of
the flower of chivalry,

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.960
all of the Knights from the
other Christian countries

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.850
were meant to come and join the crusade.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.269
That's what they did.

00:39:40.269 --> 00:39:42.720
They had the crusade was a
kind of seasonal adventure,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.180
which was called a reyse.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:49.620
So it's the Teutonic Knight
who are forcing Lithuania

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.620
to consolidate and who are
pushing Lithuania to the south.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:58.170
The Teutonic Knights creep
their way across the Baltic sea

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:03.170
as Polish rulers invite
them to come and deal

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.120
with pagan problems or other problems.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.180
Teutonic Knight come,
Teutonic Knights stay,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.210
Teutonic Knights
establish their own state.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:16.050
They rule Teutonic state
along the Baltic Sea.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.560
They do this in defiance of
the Polish Kings who say,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.420
or grand Dukes often who say,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.580
we just wanted you to solve
this particular problem.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.940
They also do it by exploiting a specific

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.270
feature of Western
Christianity, which is that

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.348
the Teutonic Knights play off between

00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:35.520
the Holy Roman Emperor, we'll talk about

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.480
what this means later on,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.800
but the Holy Roman Emperor,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.560
the chief secular figure in the west,

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.020
the chief secular leader, and the Pope.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.960
They manage to play off
between these two patrons

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.690
and essentially do what
they want and become

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.100
a power into themselves.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.110
So these are armed monks.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.490
They are crusaders.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.740
They're men who isolate
themselves from the world

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.339
who are trained in the
spirit of sacrifice.

00:40:58.339 --> 00:41:00.663
Their fellow monks find them intimidating.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:06.570
Their basic program of Christian
conversion, as I mentioned,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.960
is that you attack, you kill all the men,

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.820
you resettle your own
men, and that's baptism,

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.440
that's conversion.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.080
Their major achievement
was the colonization

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.410
of the Baltic Basin, from
what's now in Northern Poland,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.540
all the way up to what's now Estonia

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.070
where Germans had some
kind of significant social

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:34.070
and political presence for
the next 700 years until 1945

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.750
and the arrival of the red army.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.480
So they begin something which
lasts in some form or another

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.373
for a very long time.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.730
So it is their war.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.080
We're now getting to the crux,

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.250
which I'm sure you already understand,

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.150
it is their war against
Lithuania which coincides with

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.150
and brings about the Lithuanian absorption

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.480
of the lands of Rus'.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.420
They are fighting in the late 13th century

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.620
into the 14th century.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.600
I'm gonna read you one long quotation

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.970
from the chronicler of
the Teutonic Knights,

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:08.160
Peter of Dusburg, just
because it gives you

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.230
the flavor of how they saw it.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.440
The odd kind of respect
that the crusaders,

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.000
the Teutonic Knights,
had for the Lithuanians,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.040
but also the fierceness of this.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.390
This is from 1283.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.980
He writes, 53 years had
flowed since the war began

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.740
on the Prussian nation,
and all the nations

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.280
in the said land, Prussia, had
been beaten and exterminated

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.820
so that not one survived which
did not humbly bow the neck

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.170
to the Holy Roman Church.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.963
Okay, so that's Prussia, which is gone.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.380
The afore said brethren
of the German house, us,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.540
Teutonic Knights,
initiated the war against

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.390
this mighty people, most hard of neck

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.600
and well versed in war, which
is neighbor to land of Prussia

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.840
dwelling beyond the Nemunas
River in the land of Lithuania.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.177
So that's how it looks
from the Teutonic Knight's

00:42:54.177 --> 00:42:55.143
point of view.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.953
The Lithuanian reaction is not,

00:42:58.953 --> 00:43:01.740
we will never become Christian.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.260
Lithuanian reaction seems to have been,

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.400
we will not become Christian this way.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.713
We will not become Christian this way.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:16.700
So in the late 13th century
and the early 14th century,

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.280
what you have is a kind of
geometry of four powers.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.873
Where there's Poland,
there's Galicia-Volhynia,

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:34.070
there are the Knights,
and there is Lithuania,

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:41.690
and there is What's left of Rus',

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.850
which is no longer a political entity.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:49.850
So what happens is that the Lithuanians,

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:57.260
facing this challenge, move
south in the early 14th century.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.070
They attacked the city of Breast,

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.513
which is now in Belarus.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.560
By 1323 it appears that they
have also controlled Kyiv.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.420
But the crucial thing here is that,

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.829
although there seemed to have
been some armed engagements

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:16.290
in the beginning, the
Lithuanian rule Rus',

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.910
not just in a spirit of toleration,

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.800
but in the spirit of appropriation.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.750
So they come to the great ruler,

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.170
they come to the princes
of Rus', and they say,

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:29.580
in their own language, we're
not gonna bring anything new

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.530
and we're not gonna change anything old.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.850
How do they say it in their own language?

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:34.710
Because remember the
Lithuanian Grand Dukes

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.650
are ruling a country which
is already majority Slavic.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.060
It's already majority Eastern Christian,

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.436
it's already majority Slavic,

00:44:40.436 --> 00:44:43.860
it already controls some of
the lands that had been Rus',

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.910
which is Belarus.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.270
So it is not as though
Christianity, or orthodoxy,

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.070
or even the language
is unfamiliar to them.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.150
They know all of these things,

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.410
they know what Christians are, right?

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.760
They know all of this stuff.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.870
So they say to the princes of Rus',

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.610
you don't have to change anything.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.070
We're just gonna marry into your families,

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.420
you're gonna regard us as
the center of the state,

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.250
and you're gonna organize taxes for us.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.180
And that's how it works.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.483
And it seems to have worked very smoothly.

00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:19.068
So this process then all
comes to a kind of crux

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.541
in the last part of the 14th century.

00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:28.541
The Lithuanians are pressed from the west,

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.703
they have absorbed the lands to the south.

00:45:33.669 --> 00:45:36.416
But the way that the
Lithuanians actually find a way

00:45:36.416 --> 00:45:40.680
to defeat the Teutonic Knights finally

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.580
is by making an Alliance with the Poles.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.520
And this is carried out by the
second Lithuanian Grand Duke,

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.750
whose name I really want you to remember

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.270
after Gediminas, which is Jogaila,

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.900
or as he's remembered by
the Poles, as Jagiello.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:59.610
So, oh, sorry, I forgot
something very important.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:00.900
The Lithuanian Grand Dukes,

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.640
they not only know all about this.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.000
They know about Rus', they
know that Rus' existed.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.280
They know that Rus' was
a very important state.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.463
And so to their own
list of titles they add,

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.947
we are the rulers of Rus'.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.670
So the Lithuanian grand Dukes add,

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.620
we are the rulers of Rus'.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.390
So from their point of view,

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.838
they have not just
inherited the territory.

00:46:23.838 --> 00:46:27.120
They've inherited also the patrimony,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.200
in the legal sense,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.987
we are the rulers of
this thing called Rus'.

00:46:32.077 --> 00:46:34.170
And, as I said before, in the
earlier part of this lecture,

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.910
they inherit the legal language

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.010
and they began to use it themselves.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.200
And that's not such a
stretch, because remember,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.210
they're used to using Slavic languages.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.970
Slavic languages are nothing
new, nothing surprising.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.230
It's good to have a written one.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.130
Okay.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.190
But the way that this
history reaches a climax

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.110
has to do with Poland.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.563
Poland has a succession crisis.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:02.090
The king of Poland is a 11,
12, maybe 13 year old girl.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.020
It looks for a moment as
though she's gonna be married

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.340
to a Hapsburg.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.330
If that had happened, the
whole history of our region

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.820
would've been very, very different.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.030
But the Habsburg, who was called Wilhelm,

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.540
who's riding to claim his
Polish bride never makes it,

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.820
he's stopped by some Polish
Nobles along the way.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.820
And instead this girl is
married to a much older man.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:33.960
I mean, I'm afraid it's
a little scandalous.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.823
He's like 40 years older than she is.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.880
Though Lithuania's not scandalized.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.713
So, Jogaila, what is her name by the way?

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.233
Jadvyga or Hedwig.

00:47:47.233 --> 00:47:49.950
She has a very interesting past, too.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.170
I mean, she has a fascinating past,

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.660
she's only just a very young girl,

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.910
but she's been raised
for interesting things.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.010
But anyway, she turns out
to be the king of Poland.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.954
Her name is Jadvyga or Hedwig.

00:48:00.954 --> 00:48:03.930
She marries Jogaila.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:07.440
And in that way, a whole bunch
of things happen at once.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.440
The Lithuanians, the ruling
family convert to Christianity,

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.510
1385, 1386.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.420
Slowly, the Lithuanian nobility,

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.463
which includes the old Rusia nobility,

00:48:21.463 --> 00:48:23.940
will merge with the Polish nobility

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.370
and start to take up some of its norms,

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.870
which we'll talk about.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:31.590
But most importantly, a new
state, a defacto new state,

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:32.940
it's a personal union.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.503
It's a personal union between
Lithuanian Grand Dukes,

00:48:36.503 --> 00:48:39.360
who will also be Polish Kings, is set up

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.280
and it will bump along
for the next 200 years.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.310
So the Polish, the Lithuanian Grand Dukes

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.340
and the Polish Kings are
generally gonna be the same people

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.990
for quite a while now.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.180
For a couple hundred years.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.340
And what this means for these territories

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.230
is hugely important for Kyiv.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.580
We're keeping our focus on Kyiv.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.750
This means that Kyiv is
gonna be attached to Vilnius

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:08.750
and to Poland from roughly
1320 until roughly 1670.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.800
For a very long period of time,

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.590
which we'll be dealing with
in the next several lectures.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.170
It means that this, so
there's also gonna be this,

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.480
the Northeast, there's also
gonna be Galicia-Volhynia,

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.553
that most of Rus' is gonna be in this

00:49:23.553 --> 00:49:28.553
Lithuanian Polish synthesis
for the next several centuries.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.280
Where this all leads to is a famous battle

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.616
that all the Polish kids,
and actually all the students

00:49:34.616 --> 00:49:38.044
from much of Eastern
Europe will know about,

00:49:38.044 --> 00:49:38.940
which is the battle of Grunwald.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.880
The famous battle of Grunwald
which is famous for Poles,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.210
famous for Lithuanians.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.060
It's the battle where decisively, in 1410,

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.980
it's the battle which is
so shocking to everyone,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.350
which it's referred to
by both Hitler and Stalin

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.700
during the second world war,

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.500
it's still taught as fundamental.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.646
It's the battle where the
Lithuanian Grand Duke,

00:49:57.646 --> 00:50:01.170
who is now king of Poland,
and can now marshal an army

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.270
which includes people
from Rus' and Poland,

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.310
as well as Lithuania, where he decisively

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.730
defeats the Teutonic Knights.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.350
And the reason why it's
remembered, or one of the reasons,

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:15.060
if you go to central park,
which you will, right?

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.590
You're in New Haven, you're
gonna go to central park, right?

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.550
It's not far away.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:22.392
There's a statue of Jogaila,
Jagiello, holding two swords.

00:50:22.392 --> 00:50:24.960
And one of them is his.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.670
And the other one is the
one which was given to him

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:28.620
by the grand master of
the Teutonic Knights,

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.000
according to legend at least,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.540
at the beginning of the
battle on the logic of,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.840
you're going to need this.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.150
And so that little bit of
like Teutonic arrogance

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.650
got remembered down the centuries.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.140
And so the notion of
Jagiello going to battle

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.510
with the two swords, and
of course the Lithuanians,

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:49.710
the Poles, the Slavs
winning is something which

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:50.850
made a big mark in history.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.590
Okay, we're gonna leave you there.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:54.784
We're gonna pick up with
this Polish, Lithuanian,

00:50:54.784 --> 00:50:59.370
Ruthenian synthesis next time around.

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.220
But we're also gonna try to
explain how we get to Russia.

00:51:05.425 --> 00:51:08.675
(ethereal chime plays)

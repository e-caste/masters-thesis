00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.158
Professor Steven Smith:
Well, today I'm going to finish

00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:08.510
Tocqueville or,
to put it a different way,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.895
I'm going to say what I can
about Tocqueville in 50 minutes,

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.306
which is hardly finishing him.
In fact, we've hardly begun but

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:21.150
I want to talk about two things,
two aspects of the book today,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.548
again, which will again only
scratch the surface,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:31.160
and those two topics are the
following.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.391
I want to talk about--a little
bit about the moral and

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:41.622
psychological components or
features of the democratic

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:45.114
state,
which is largely the subject

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:50.213
matter of Volume 2 of the
Democracy and I also want

00:00:50.213 --> 00:00:54.150
to speak about the role of
statesmanship.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.858
I mentioned earlier the issue
of Tocqueville as educator,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.109
as a kind of political
educator,

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.525
and I want to talk today,
end up today by talking a

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:08.941
little bit about how he
understands the role of the

00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:14.132
democratic statesman.
But the first part--first

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:19.738
subject is largely,
again, the subject matter of

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:22.537
Volume 2.
Volume 1 of the

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:26.548
Democracy,
as you've probably noticed,

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:30.453
focuses mainly,
not exclusively to be sure but

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:34.452
mainly on what I suppose we
would call "the social and

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:38.150
political institutions of
democratic society,"

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.540
the institutional development
of the democratic state.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.074
Volume 2 focuses much more on,
so to call it,

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:54.993
the moral and psychological
components of the democratic

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:58.897
individual.
Tocqueville here shows himself

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:02.260
more concerned with the internal
develops, again,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.796
the moral and psychological
determinants of democratic

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:13.020
character, what is it to have a
democratic soul,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.982
so to speak.
That, I think,

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:19.238
is Tocqueville's concern in the
second volume,

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:23.767
which in many ways,
at least to my way of reading

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:28.833
it, makes Volume 2 a sort of
philosophically richer

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:34.405
discussion than Volume 1,
precisely because it focuses on

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:38.729
what has the democratic social
state done to us,

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:45.199
how has it transformed us as
individuals, how has it shaped

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.256
us as individuals.
These were, in many ways,

00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:53.711
Tocqueville's deepest problems
and in this part of the book he

00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:57.656
shows himself to be a kind of
moral psychologist of the

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:01.475
democratic soul,
very much along the same lines

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:05.131
as we saw in Plato for example
in Volume 8 of the

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:09.626
Republic where Plato
speaks about the different kinds

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:13.584
of individuals,
the different kinds of souls

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:18.712
that are appropriate and have
been shaped by different kinds

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:22.329
of regimes.
But I'd like to start with--I

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.460
want to focus on three aspects,
spend a little time on three of

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.786
the components,
aspects, psychological

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:38.876
components of the democratic
individual, and those in no

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:45.580
particular order I want to
discuss as compassion,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.610
what this translation has as
restiveness, and self-interest.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.579
Taken together,
I think, these three terms or

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.082
these three concepts constitute,
as it were, the sort of moral

00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:07.223
scope of the democratic state.
In describing these character

00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:11.154
traits, Tocqueville is providing
us with a kind of moral

00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:14.687
phenomenology,
and excuse please a rather

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:18.876
pretentious term,
kind of moral phenomenology of

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:23.288
democratic life,
one in which we are invited to

00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:28.364
look and ask whether we see
ourselves in this description

00:04:28.364 --> 00:04:32.079
and whether we like what it is
we see.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:35.481
The first of these features
that I want to focus on,

00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:39.549
the most important moral effect
in some respects the democracy

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:44.054
has had on its citizen,
is for Tocqueville the constant

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:48.329
tendency to make us gentler
towards one another.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:51.214
This is an old
eighteenth-century theme,

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:55.281
to make us more compassionate,
to make us gentler in our

00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:58.610
manners, habits,
morals with one another.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.940
This is an old problem.
Montesquieu,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.008
Tocqueville's great
eighteenth-century

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:06.137
precursor--Montesquieu had
argued in the Spirit of the

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:09.335
Laws,
L'esprit des Lois,

00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:14.650
that it was commerce that
instituted a kind of softening

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.672
effects on manners and morals,
moving us or taking us from a

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:24.969
kind of warlike,
aristocratic ethic to one of

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.658
gentler manners and morals,
and Montesquieu had attributed

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:32.180
this largely to the influence of
commerce.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.994
Rousseau, you will remember,
in the Second Discourse,

00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:36.759
the Discourse on
Inequality,

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.107
made pitiÃ© or
compassion, a repugnance to view

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:45.771
the suffering of others,
as a fundamental feature of

00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:48.684
natural man.
Compassion, for Rousseau,

00:05:48.684 --> 00:05:52.209
remained a kind of remnant of
our natural goodness,

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:56.724
the fact that we can still cry
or sympathize or empathize,

00:05:56.724 --> 00:06:00.490
as we might say,
with the plight of others even

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.779
with the growth of noisier and
more powerful passions.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.554
This sort of capacity for
sympathy or compassion remains

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:15.370
even in civilized life a kind of
remnant of our natural goodness.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.210
But for Tocqueville,
this feature of compassion is

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.068
not so much a feature of natural
man as it was for Rousseau but

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:28.560
it is for democratic life,
a democratic social life.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.688
It is not nature but democracy
that has rendered us gentler and

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:37.410
led to the softening of morals
and manners.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.322
What does Tocqueville mean by
that, when he says,

00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:42.810
"life in democracy has become
gentler"?

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.097
In a very powerful chapter
called "How Mores Become Milder

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:52.057
as Conditions are Equalized,"
here he describes some of the

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:56.859
moral and psychological
consequences of the transition

00:06:56.859 --> 00:07:01.480
from the age of aristocracy to
one of democracy.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.067
Under aristocratic times,
he says, in aristocratic ages,

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:15.011
individuals inhabited a world
apart where members of one class

00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.630
or one tribe may have been
similar to one another but they

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.493
regarded themselves as being
fundamentally different from the

00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:28.870
members of all other social
classes or tribes.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.995
This did not so much render
people cruel but it did render

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:39.301
them indifferent to the pain and
suffering of others outside

00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:42.164
their group.
Under democracy,

00:07:42.164 --> 00:07:45.459
however, he says,
where all are equal,

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:50.980
all of us tend to think and
feel in nearly the same manner.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.100
We no longer make or imagine
these kinds of distinctions.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.622
The moral imagination,
so called, of the democratic

00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:05.778
citizen, is able to transport
itself into the positions of

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:09.758
others more easily than
individuals living in

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:14.451
aristocratic times.
All become alike or at least

00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:19.660
all are projected or perceived
as being alike in our range of

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.480
emotions, sensibilities,
capacities for moral

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.930
sympathies.
As people become more like one

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.091
another, Tocqueville says,
they show themselves

00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:34.075
reciprocally compassionate
regarding their miseries and the

00:08:34.075 --> 00:08:38.262
laws of nations become milder,
the laws of nations become

00:08:38.262 --> 00:08:42.171
milder, they show themselves
reciprocally compassionate to

00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:46.146
one another.
That transformation of one of

00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:52.342
the key ethics of social life
for Tocqueville has had profound

00:08:52.342 --> 00:08:56.564
effects on us.
It has certainly made people

00:08:56.564 --> 00:09:00.039
gentler and more civil to one
another.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.995
Such things,
he tells us,

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:06.963
as torture, deliberate cruelty,
sort of spectacles of pain and

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:11.607
humiliation that were once so
much a part of everyday life

00:09:11.607 --> 00:09:15.679
have largely been eliminated
from the world.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.519
I say largely,
not entirely to be sure.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:22.803
We more readily identify
ourselves with the pain or

00:09:22.803 --> 00:09:27.773
suffering of people possibly in
very different parts of the

00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:30.590
world,
world parts that we've never

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.190
seen and may never visit.
Consider, for example,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.129
our response to the victims of
the tsunami in Indonesia or the

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:43.083
genocide in Darfur.
All of these events affecting

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.457
people in places,
again, where we may never go

00:09:46.457 --> 00:09:51.029
nevertheless seem to have a
claim on our moral sympathies.

00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:55.787
President Bill Clinton
profoundly captured this sense

00:09:55.787 --> 00:10:00.635
of enlarged moral sympathy when
he told his audiences,

00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:03.850
"I feel your pain."
Remember?

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.281
I don't know.
You probably won't remember

00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:07.250
that but you've probably heard
the expression.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.233
It seems to show a kind of
enlargement of the moral

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:15.616
sympathies, being able to put
oneself in the position of

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:19.679
others who one doesn't know and
may never meet.

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:24.179
This is all a part of what
Tocqueville understands,

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:29.309
the softening of morals under a
democratic way of life.

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:32.760
And Tocqueville clearly regards
this, in many ways,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.901
as a moral progress of sorts in
our unwillingness to tolerate

00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:40.490
policies of deliberate cruelty
in his statement,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.184
perhaps premature,
that Americans of all the

00:10:44.184 --> 00:10:48.995
people in the world have
succeeded or almost succeeded in

00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:54.876
abolishing the death penalty,
not quite true but nevertheless

00:10:54.876 --> 00:11:00.174
maybe more truer than it is now.
In democratic centuries,

00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:05.395
he says, men--but all of this
compassion--here is--but here is

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:09.333
the problem.
All of this compassion comes

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:13.083
still at a price.
In democratic centuries,

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:17.935
he writes, men rarely devote
themselves to one another but

00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:22.873
they show a general compassion
for all members of the human

00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:24.595
species.
They rarely,

00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:26.799
he says, devote themselves to
one another.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:33.090
This sort of generalized
sympathy is genuine but soft.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:39.358
My ability to feel your pain
does not really require me to do

00:11:39.358 --> 00:11:43.914
much about it.
Compassion, you might say,

00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:48.129
turns out to be a rather easy
virtue.

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:51.399
It suggests sensitivity and
openness.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:55.240
It implies caring without being
judgmental.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.710
It is not entirely relativistic
but it certainly refrains from

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.553
imposing one's own moral
judgments and way of life upon

00:12:05.553 --> 00:12:09.238
others.
Does Tocqueville believe that

00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:14.450
democratic peoples are in
dangers of becoming too soft,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:19.396
too morally sensitive,
too incapable of exhibiting the

00:12:19.396 --> 00:12:23.036
kind of harsher,
what we might call more

00:12:23.036 --> 00:12:26.490
aristocratic virtues of
nobility,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.812
of self-sacrifice,
of love of honor that formed

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:32.340
the moral code of previous
times?

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.170
Well, the answer to that
question is yes,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.779
he surely did believe that was
becoming the case.

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:42.967
Compassion is for Tocqueville
in many ways an admirable

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:47.387
sentiment and again it is one
likely to expand our rage of

00:12:47.387 --> 00:12:51.652
moral sympathies but there is
something called a kind of

00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:55.684
misplaced compassion that
Tocqueville is very fearful

00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:59.034
about.
Compassion is a virtue but it

00:12:59.034 --> 00:13:02.392
carries with us--with it,
like every virtue,

00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:05.360
its own particular forms of
misuse,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.795
for example,
when compassion becomes a

00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:14.458
standard by which to express our
forms of moral superiority to

00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:17.549
others.
Consider the following.

00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:20.974
To be accused today,
particularly in places like

00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:24.399
college campuses,
to be accused of insensitivity

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:26.951
to others,
to some kind of moral

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.160
insensitivity,
is among many of us considered

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.370
one of the worst moral crimes
imaginable.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.157
We must all care or at least we
must all pretend as if we care,

00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:42.714
yes, or must be seen to care
about the plight of others much

00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:46.730
worse off than ourselves and the
result of this,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.864
and I think this is
Tocqueville's point,

00:13:49.864 --> 00:13:54.846
seems to be to create new moral
hierarchies of compassion where

00:13:54.846 --> 00:13:58.865
one's superiority is
demonstrated by our heightened

00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:02.159
sensitivity and feeling for
others.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:06.611
And it is precisely this kind
of misplaced compassion,

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:11.399
asking the question who is the
most sensitive among us,

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:16.125
a very Rousseauian type
question, this kind of misplaced

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:19.202
compassion that is,
I think, one of the

00:14:19.202 --> 00:14:22.751
psychological determinants of
what we would call today

00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:26.923
"political correctness,"
obviously a term Tocqueville

00:14:26.923 --> 00:14:30.554
does not use,
but you might think of the way

00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:35.203
in which the language of pity,
compassion, sensitivity,

00:14:35.203 --> 00:14:39.550
has so much shaped our moral
vocabulary, ways of thinking

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.500
about ourselves and judging
others.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.460
If you don't believe me,
watch almost any daytime

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.657
afternoon show like Oprah or any
of these other shows and you'll

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:56.442
see exactly what I'm talking
about and of course you've all

00:14:56.442 --> 00:15:00.463
seen these shows,
I think many more times than I

00:15:00.463 --> 00:15:02.940
have but
nevertheless--compassion.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.771
This is the first or one
feature of democratic social

00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:13.887
life but it is not the only one.
It is connected or at least it

00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:18.831
exists alongside another.
At the core also of the

00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:23.801
psychological life of modern
democratic citizens,

00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:28.232
Tocqueville writes,
is a profound sense of

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:33.320
uneasiness, of anxiety,
that Tocqueville calls by the

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.101
French term inquietude,
a word that maybe is difficult

00:15:39.101 --> 00:15:42.844
to translate into English,
inquietude,

00:15:42.844 --> 00:15:45.567
anxiety.
In earlier translation,

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:50.588
this was called restlessness.
In this particular translation,

00:15:50.588 --> 00:15:55.359
you have restiveness to
indicate the sort of perpetually

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:59.610
dissatisfied character of the
democratic soul.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.223
In many ways,
the democratic soul,

00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:05.630
like democracy itself,
is never complete.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:13.110
It is always a work in progress.
And this feeling of perpetual

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.298
restlessness for Tocqueville is
tied to the desire for

00:16:17.298 --> 00:16:21.405
well-being and by that he means
particularly material

00:16:21.405 --> 00:16:25.702
well-being.
It is the desire for happiness

00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:31.565
measured largely in terms of
material happiness that is the

00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:35.710
dominant drive of the democratic
soul.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.453
In many ways,
Tocqueville brings to his

00:16:39.453 --> 00:16:44.576
analysis of democratic
restiveness--you can see in it

00:16:44.576 --> 00:16:50.388
something of the aristocrat's
disdain for the acquisition of

00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:56.102
you might say mere material
goods for which most of us have

00:16:56.102 --> 00:17:01.436
to work so hard to acquire.
Perhaps more than anything else

00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:04.599
this is what perplexes
Tocqueville about democracy.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:09.393
Democracy meant for him
predominantly a kind of middle

00:17:09.393 --> 00:17:13.282
class way of life,
bourgeois life made up of

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:18.528
people who are constantly in
pursuit of some obscure object

00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:23.197
of their own desires.
Consider the following passage,

00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:27.077
one of my favorite from the
entire book, from a chapter

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:29.808
entitled,
"Why the Americans Show

00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:34.440
Themselves so Restive in the
Midst of their Well-Being."

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.085
Let me read it at some length.
"In the United States," he

00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:43.436
says, "a man carefully builds a
dwelling in which to pass his

00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:47.859
declining years and sells it
while the roof is being laid.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:51.931
He plants a garden and he rents
it out just as he was going to

00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:55.167
taste its fruits.
He clears a field and he leaves

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:57.769
it to others to care for the
harvesting.

00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:00.809
He embraces a profession and
quits it.

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:05.474
He settles in a place from
which he departs soon after so

00:18:05.474 --> 00:18:09.140
as to take his changing desires
elsewhere.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.181
Should his private affairs give
him some respite,

00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:16.299
he immediately plunges into the
whirlwind of politics and when,

00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:20.636
toward the end of a year filled
with some leisure still remains

00:18:20.636 --> 00:18:24.902
to him, he carries his restive
curiosity here and there within

00:18:24.902 --> 00:18:27.769
the vast limits of the United
States,

00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:32.759
carrying his restive curiosity
wherever he may go.

00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:36.812
He will thus go 500 leagues in
a day in order better to

00:18:36.812 --> 00:18:39.740
distract himself from his
happiness."

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.702
What a wonderful phrase,
"to distract himself from his

00:18:43.702 --> 00:18:46.987
happiness.
Death finally comes and it

00:18:46.987 --> 00:18:52.589
stops him before he has grown
weary of this useless pursuit of

00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:57.089
complete felicity that always
flees from him."

00:18:57.089 --> 00:18:59.930
Does that passage sound like
anything we may have read here?

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.307
Does it not sound as if it is
modeled almost exactly after

00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:12.974
Plato's description of the
democratic soul in Book VIII of

00:19:12.974 --> 00:19:17.111
the Republic,
a person who is constantly

00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:21.119
moving, constantly restless,
constantly unable to

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:26.212
concentrate or to bear down on
the one or very few things that

00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:31.390
give life a sense of wholeness
and meaning and integrity?

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.221
Here is the democratic man,
restive in the midst of

00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:41.150
well-being, constantly moving
ahead or moving to,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.619
as he says, distract himself
from his own happiness.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:49.667
Tocqueville writes here,
it seems, with a kind of

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:53.630
disdain for a life understood as
a constant and,

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.750
in his view,
self-defeating pursuit of

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.373
happiness.
The desire for well-being you

00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:04.371
might say becomes the
right--almost the right of the

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.605
democrat and the more one
desires happiness the more it

00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:12.993
eludes our grasp.
In the sentence just after the

00:20:12.993 --> 00:20:16.279
passage I just read,
Tocqueville says,

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:21.074
"One is at first astonished to
contemplate the singular

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:26.491
agitation displayed by so many
happy men in the midst of their

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:30.928
abundance."
And you can sense Tocqueville's

00:20:30.928 --> 00:20:35.140
irony in his use of the term "so
many happy,"

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.601
the distractions,
the agitation,

00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:41.888
complete agitation displayed,
he says, by so many happy

00:20:41.888 --> 00:20:45.700
individuals in the midst of
their abundance.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.661
There's a world of social
commentary condensed into those

00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:52.777
sentences.
His combination of words like

00:20:52.777 --> 00:20:57.234
"agitation" and "abundance" in
the same--again in the same

00:20:57.234 --> 00:21:01.691
context as the pursuit of
happiness indicates for him that

00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:06.617
this way of life is more likely
to bring frustration and anxiety

00:21:06.617 --> 00:21:10.839
than it is to bring us
satisfaction and repose.

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:15.919
And he traces this continual
restlessness back to what seems

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:20.224
to be for the democratic
social--for the democratic

00:21:20.224 --> 00:21:24.529
individual the virtual
obligation to be happy.

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:28.500
I would ask you in this context
if you have some time to read

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.006
Darrin McMahon's wonderful new
book on A History of

00:21:32.006 --> 00:21:35.778
Happiness to give you a
little bit of an indication of

00:21:35.778 --> 00:21:39.814
the way this term has been used
throughout its history and the

00:21:39.814 --> 00:21:44.380
way in which in many ways the
obligation to pursue happiness,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.575
to restiveness,
that kind of restiveness,

00:21:47.575 --> 00:21:50.930
is the source of so much,
as he puts it,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.374
singular--the singular
melancholy, he says,

00:21:54.374 --> 00:21:58.720
that the inhabitants of
democratic lands often display

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.919
amid their abundance.
Life, liberty,

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:06.516
the pursuit of happiness have
become what one person once

00:22:06.516 --> 00:22:11.442
called a kind of joyless quest
for joy and this is the second

00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:16.174
feature,
this restless or restive

00:22:16.174 --> 00:22:20.820
character of democracy.
And finally,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.888
the third feature of democratic
psychology that I want to focus

00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:31.119
on is this idea of self-interest
or self-interest well understood

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:35.666
as Tocqueville calls it.
This is a doctrine with which

00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:39.869
everybody is familiar from
courses on moral psychology,

00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.696
on utilitarianism,
to modern courses on--from--in

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:48.160
economics and game theory and
other things where the term

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.826
"self-interest" is regarded
almost as sort of a

00:22:51.826 --> 00:22:55.493
talismanic--has almost
talismanic properties of

00:22:55.493 --> 00:22:59.240
explaining all kinds of human
behavior.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.988
But Tocqueville means something
very specific by self-interest

00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:05.140
or self-interest well
understood.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.576
It is in one sense the kind of,
you might say,

00:23:08.576 --> 00:23:12.930
everyday utilitarianism,
not in any strict of the term,

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.664
with which we are instinctively
familiar when we hear or are

00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:22.317
told things like honesty is the
best policy and things like

00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:25.367
this.
It seems simple and obvious

00:23:25.367 --> 00:23:30.799
enough but it in fact is a very
complex and difficult history.

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:34.877
By the time that Tocqueville
wrote these chapters in the

00:23:34.877 --> 00:23:38.287
Democracy,
theories of self-interest had

00:23:38.287 --> 00:23:42.735
long been a kind of staple of
European moral philosophy going

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:46.220
back to the seventeenth century
at least,

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.970
going back to people like
Hobbes and others.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:53.645
The question is what work does
this idea, this concept,

00:23:53.645 --> 00:23:58.579
of self-interest rightly
understood do for Tocqueville?

00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:01.491
In the first place,
he understands it somewhat

00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:03.950
differently than,
I think, we would.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.427
When we hear the term
"self-interest," we are likely

00:24:08.427 --> 00:24:13.431
to think of it as opposed to or
to think of its antonym as

00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:16.680
indicating some kind of
altruism.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.247
While interest or self-interest
is thought of as inherently

00:24:21.247 --> 00:24:24.870
self-regarding,
altruism or something like that

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:29.359
is an other regarded--an other
regarding disposition,

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:31.750
regarding the welfare,
well-being of others.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.737
But when Tocqueville talks
about self-interest,

00:24:35.737 --> 00:24:40.852
self-interested behavior was
put forward by him as a kind of

00:24:40.852 --> 00:24:45.880
comprehensive antonym to
behavior motivated by vanity,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.857
by honor and,
above all, by the concept of

00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:54.028
glory, terms,
remember, thinking--going back

00:24:54.028 --> 00:24:59.557
to Hobbes in some way and
Hobbes' concern to replace ideas

00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:03.829
of vanity,
vainglory and pride with a

00:25:03.829 --> 00:25:08.954
notion of fear of death,
a kind of self-interested

00:25:08.954 --> 00:25:13.472
behavior.
While glory was for Tocqueville

00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:19.049
and others associated with war
and warlike pursuits,

00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:22.859
interest, self-interest,
was invariably associated with

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:25.400
commerce and peaceful
competition.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.630
In contrast,
in other words,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.759
to the aristocratic concern
with fame and honor,

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:34.859
interest was
regarded--self-interest was

00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:39.309
regarded as a relatively
peaceful or harmless disposition

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:44.235
leading us to cooperate with one
another for the sake of common

00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:47.307
ends.
The pursuit of self-interest

00:25:47.307 --> 00:25:51.387
has a kind of unmistakably
democratic and egalitarian

00:25:51.387 --> 00:25:55.395
impulse behind.
The pursuit of self-interest is

00:25:55.395 --> 00:26:00.503
something literally everyone is
able to follow even while such

00:26:00.503 --> 00:26:05.109
things as honor and glory seem
to be by nature unequally

00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:10.619
available to different people.
And into this debate between an

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:15.278
ethic of honor and glory and an
ethic of self-interest or

00:26:15.278 --> 00:26:20.104
self-interest rightly understood
enters Tocqueville and his

00:26:20.104 --> 00:26:24.594
Democracy in America.
He begins his chapter called,

00:26:24.594 --> 00:26:28.023
"How the Americans Combat
Individualism by the Doctrine of

00:26:28.023 --> 00:26:30.250
Self-Interest Rightly
Understood,"

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.789
with the following sentence,
with the following observation.

00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:37.039
He writes, "When the world was
led by a few wealthy and

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:39.687
powerful individuals,
these liked to form for

00:26:39.687 --> 00:26:41.891
themselves.
They liked to form for

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.730
themselves a sublime idea of the
duties of man.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.579
They were pleased to profess
that it is glorious to forget

00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:54.853
oneself and that it is fitting
to do good without self-interest

00:26:54.853 --> 00:26:58.823
like God Himself.
This was the official doctrine

00:26:58.823 --> 00:27:02.171
of the time in matters of
morality, speaking of

00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:05.226
aristocratic ages.
I doubt that men," he says,

00:27:05.226 --> 00:27:08.165
"were more virtuous in
aristocratic centuries than in

00:27:08.165 --> 00:27:11.330
others but it is certain that
the beauties of virtue were

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.484
constantly spoken of.
Only in secret," he concludes,

00:27:15.484 --> 00:27:18.080
"did men study its utility."

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.713
You might think about that
passage perhaps in section but

00:27:26.713 --> 00:27:31.266
note that Tocqueville adds to
the concept of self-interest

00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:35.260
this idea or this modifier of
well understood.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.821
What does this add?
What is he intending that to

00:27:39.821 --> 00:27:42.638
say?
Self-interest well understood

00:27:42.638 --> 00:27:47.049
is not the same thing as egoism
or what Rousseau called

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:49.990
amour-proper,
for example.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.484
It is not the desire simply to
be talked about,

00:27:53.484 --> 00:27:57.054
to be looked at,
to be first in the race of life

00:27:57.054 --> 00:27:59.875
in that way.
Rather, self-interest is

00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:03.822
connected, and self-interest
well understood is connected to

00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:07.702
this passion for well-being and
the desire to improve one's

00:28:07.702 --> 00:28:11.448
conditions that remained for
Tocqueville a very important

00:28:11.448 --> 00:28:15.715
wellspring of human actions.
But it is important to remember

00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:19.132
that these are not the only
desires or these are not the

00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:22.517
only motives for action.
Tocqueville probably is

00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:26.973
distinguished from many social
scientists today by suggesting

00:28:26.973 --> 00:28:30.908
that self-interest well
understood is not some kind of

00:28:30.908 --> 00:28:34.250
universal determinant of human
behavior.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.208
It is not something universal.
It is a product of a particular

00:28:39.208 --> 00:28:41.244
social state,
a particular,

00:28:41.244 --> 00:28:44.769
we might say,
the democratic social state.

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:48.778
He is not in this sense a kind
of moral or psychological

00:28:48.778 --> 00:28:52.859
reductionist who wants to see
one cause of human behavior

00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:55.920
across all centuries and all
climates.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.730
He is not saying that all
behavior is self-interested.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.894
In fact, in that very chapter
on self-interest rightly

00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:06.819
understood you will
remember--you may remember,

00:29:06.819 --> 00:29:12.705
you probably don't remember,
that he quotes in a footnote an

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:16.711
essay by Montaigne,
a name that I've mentioned

00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.197
before, an essay by Montaigne
called Of Glory to remind

00:29:21.197 --> 00:29:25.315
the reader that the desire for
fame and honor will always

00:29:25.315 --> 00:29:29.579
contend with the desire for
well-being and happiness.

00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:34.986
And in many ways,
these are two conflicting

00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:40.223
motives of human behavior.
What did he believe that this

00:29:40.223 --> 00:29:43.490
ethic of self-interest well
understood would bring about?

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:48.546
Again, like compassion,
the doctrine of self-interest

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:54.186
has done much to sort of soften
the harsher features of the

00:29:54.186 --> 00:29:58.809
aristocratic ethics,
of warlike--of the warlike

00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:02.153
nobility.
Self-interest well understood

00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:07.081
is a kind of antidote to an
ethic of fame and glory and yet

00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:11.923
you can see throughout Volume 2
especially how Tocqueville

00:30:11.923 --> 00:30:16.511
laments the decline of this
older aristocratic codes of

00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:19.608
honor and chivalry.
By contrast,

00:30:19.608 --> 00:30:23.901
the doctrine of self-interest
well understood is not lofty,

00:30:23.901 --> 00:30:26.640
he says, but it is clear and
sure.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.880
It has characteristics of
reliability and predictability.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.464
It is not itself a virtue,
he says, but it can form people

00:30:35.464 --> 00:30:38.359
who are, and these are this
terms,

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:42.555
regulated, temperate,
moderate, foresighted,

00:30:42.555 --> 00:30:45.970
masters of themselves,
regulated,

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:52.060
temperate, moderate, farsighted.
What does that sound like?

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.801
Think about that.
What kind of person is this and

00:30:55.801 --> 00:30:58.875
what has it created?
These are the virtues of the

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:02.857
democratic republic.
Again, these may not be heroic

00:31:02.857 --> 00:31:08.287
or extraordinary qualities but
they do have the virtue of being

00:31:08.287 --> 00:31:15.744
within the range of everyone.
But is such a code or is such a

00:31:15.744 --> 00:31:21.938
moral code desirable for itself?
That's something that

00:31:21.938 --> 00:31:24.710
Tocqueville leaves a little bit
up in the air.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.278
Of all philosophical theories,
as he calls it,

00:31:28.278 --> 00:31:32.559
the doctrine of self-interest
rightly understood is,

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:37.109
he says, the most appropriate
to the needs of men in our time.

00:31:37.109 --> 00:31:41.548
Think about that judgment:
It is the most appropriate to

00:31:41.548 --> 00:31:46.802
the needs of men in our time.
It doesn't seem to suggest that

00:31:46.802 --> 00:31:52.220
this is either universal or
necessarily that it is the best.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:57.059
It is simply the best adapted
to the needs of our time,

00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:01.099
to our level of humanity,
to where we are now,

00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:05.959
and again there is a implicit-
to be sure an implicit kind of

00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:11.061
critique suggested in those--in
that phrase that you might think

00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:15.920
about as you read or as you go
back to that important chapter

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.160
on self-interest and its role
in,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.700
again, the shaping of the
modern democratic individual.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:34.142
So these three characteristics,
compassion--What was the other

00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:36.640
one?
What?

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.780
Restlessness, yes.
Well, good.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.480
I'm-- Yes.
Yeah.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.410
I can't even remember what I'm
talking about.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.370
Restlessness and self-interest.
I was just--I was quizzing you.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.919
I was just checking.
It doesn't have anything to do

00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:50.320
with short-term memory loss.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:33:00.785
These are what has shaped us
and Tocqueville holds this up as

00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:05.922
a kind of portrait in a
democratic individual and also

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:10.962
of course primarily to--not so
much to the democratic

00:33:10.962 --> 00:33:16.680
individual but to his readers
back in France and saying this

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.430
seems to be the future shape of
humanity,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.960
of democratic humanity.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.059
We need both to adapt to it in
some ways.

00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:33.639
We have to both recognize that
this is what's coming and adapt

00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:37.994
to it but we also have to be to
some degree wary of what is

00:33:37.994 --> 00:33:42.950
coming and what kind of people
we may create out of ourselves,

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.997
what may be created.
And this brings me to the theme

00:33:46.997 --> 00:33:50.867
that I mentioned at the
beginning about democratic

00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:53.710
statecraft, democratic
education.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.750
What is the role of the
statesman in a democratic age?

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:04.880
How should one adapt as well as
try to guide these features?

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.945
Democracy in America is
a work of political education,

00:34:10.945 --> 00:34:16.707
a supreme work of political
education addressed to leaders

00:34:16.707 --> 00:34:22.470
or potential leaders not only
for Tocqueville's time,

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:28.234
but for the future.
The possibilities of statecraft

00:34:28.234 --> 00:34:32.429
are, as they are always,
dependent on what we understand

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.480
politics and political science
to be.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.654
What is it?
In the introduction to the

00:34:38.654 --> 00:34:42.344
book, in one of those
characteristically epigrammatic

00:34:42.344 --> 00:34:45.750
sentences and you should be
attuned to these,

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.932
Tocqueville often likes to give
these one sentence paragraphs to

00:34:49.932 --> 00:34:53.280
highlight an idea,
to really make it stand out.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.910
I don't recommend it for you
but for him he takes one

00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:00.680
sentence and can make it--turns
it into a paragraph.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.101
He talks about this book.
He says, "Is a new political

00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:08.460
science for a world altogether
new."

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.369
That statement has to jump out
at you off the page.

00:35:11.369 --> 00:35:13.150
What is this new political
science?

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:17.519
A new political science,
again, in some ways following

00:35:17.519 --> 00:35:22.630
Machiavelli who departs from the
ancients but perhaps also from

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:27.823
his modern predecessors too like
Machiavelli and Hobbes or Locke

00:35:27.823 --> 00:35:31.863
and Rousseau.
What is the distinguishing

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:37.286
feature of the political science
for a new democratic age,

00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:43.068
for a world altogether new?
Tocqueville's new political

00:35:43.068 --> 00:35:48.924
science, let me suggest to you,
is based on a novel and

00:35:48.924 --> 00:35:55.431
profound understanding of the
relationship between history or

00:35:55.431 --> 00:35:59.769
historical forces and human
agency,

00:35:59.769 --> 00:36:05.038
between individual power-
individual powers or agency and

00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:09.473
historical forces.
Let me try to explain what I

00:36:09.473 --> 00:36:12.201
mean by that.
As any reader of the

00:36:12.201 --> 00:36:16.629
Democracy quickly notes,
even from the opening pages of

00:36:16.629 --> 00:36:20.243
the book,
Tocqueville attributes a kind

00:36:20.243 --> 00:36:23.460
of providential power to
history.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.686
The immense,
centuries-long progress or

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:34.581
transition from the aristocratic
to the democratic era seems to

00:36:34.581 --> 00:36:36.743
be,
as he describes it,

00:36:36.743 --> 00:36:40.457
almost an act of divine
providence, almost of divine

00:36:40.457 --> 00:36:44.304
will.
He warns his readers that it is

00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:50.939
a mistake, it is self-defeating
to try to resist or to turn back

00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:54.190
this movement.
This would be futile.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.326
It would not only be futile.
He even suggests it would be

00:36:57.326 --> 00:37:01.460
impious, it would be in some
ways to go against the will of

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.263
God,
as if the hand of God were

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:08.869
behind this immense historical
progress or process.

00:37:08.869 --> 00:37:12.732
Tocqueville no doubt
deliberately overstates that

00:37:12.732 --> 00:37:16.835
argument but he does so,
I think, in order to make a

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:21.574
serious and profound point.
Our politics are deeply

00:37:21.574 --> 00:37:27.623
embedded within long structures
of human history that we can do

00:37:27.623 --> 00:37:32.743
little to alter and escape.
We seem to be deeply embedded,

00:37:32.743 --> 00:37:36.106
we as individuals,
deeply embedded within these

00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:39.215
structures.
This is, to use a term that

00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:43.539
modern political scientists
often use to describe this,

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:47.799
it is an argument from what is
often called path dependency,

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:51.409
that we are again deeply
embedded within historical

00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:54.185
processes,
tendencies, paths of

00:37:54.185 --> 00:37:59.130
development that we can do
little to resist or control.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.884
And in many ways Tocqueville
often--you will find Tocqueville

00:38:03.884 --> 00:38:07.925
often writing as if he is some
kind of historical or

00:38:07.925 --> 00:38:11.728
sociological determinist
allowing little room for

00:38:11.728 --> 00:38:17.593
individual initiative or agency.
Words like "fate," "destiny,"

00:38:17.593 --> 00:38:22.711
"tendency" are frequently used
throughout the book to

00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:27.139
underscore the limits of
political action.

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:32.081
It would even be an interesting
experiment to go through the

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:36.598
book, page by page,
and find how many examples of

00:38:36.598 --> 00:38:41.639
those kinds of words,
"tendency," "fate," "destiny,"

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:46.981
these kind of deterministic
words that suggest irresistible

00:38:46.981 --> 00:38:53.191
movements, movement of history,
how many times he uses these

00:38:53.191 --> 00:38:57.427
and in what context.
And he frequently offers

00:38:57.427 --> 00:39:02.227
predictions throughout the book
on the basis of what he regards

00:39:02.227 --> 00:39:06.019
to be underlying historical and
social trends.

00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:10.980
You can hardly read a page of
the book, sometimes not even a

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:16.360
paragraph, without finding in it
some kind of prediction based on

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.766
these trends.
Again, I would ask you if you

00:39:19.766 --> 00:39:23.362
have time go through the book.
You don't have time this

00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:25.886
semester.
Maybe it'll be a great senior

00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:28.911
essay later on,
to go through the book and find

00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:31.861
examples,
as many as you can of again

00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:36.265
predictions that Tocqueville
makes on the basis of these

00:39:36.265 --> 00:39:40.829
historical--these--this claim
about historical forces.

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:45.143
And much of this seems to deny,
taken literally,

00:39:45.143 --> 00:39:50.649
much of this would seem to deny
the role of independent human

00:39:50.649 --> 00:39:54.320
initiative or statecraft in
history.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.636
Consider the following passage
from pages 154 and 155 of your

00:40:00.636 --> 00:40:04.846
translation.
Here is what Tocqueville writes

00:40:04.846 --> 00:40:08.571
about the statesman.
He says, "Sometimes after a

00:40:08.571 --> 00:40:12.938
thousand efforts the legislator
succeeds in exerting an indirect

00:40:12.938 --> 00:40:16.958
influence on the destiny of
nations and then one celebrates

00:40:16.958 --> 00:40:20.840
his genius whereas often the
geographical position of the

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.960
country about which he can do
nothing,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.910
a social state that was created
without his concurrence,

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.429
mores and ideas of whose origin
he is ignorant,

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:35.120
a point of departure unknown to
him, in part irresistible

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.943
movements to society against
which he struggles in vain and

00:40:38.943 --> 00:40:43.550
which carry him along in turn."
There you go.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:49.240
He gives us a list of all of
the different determinants of

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.833
human surrounding conditions,
geography, mores,

00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:56.832
social position.
These, he says,

00:40:56.832 --> 00:40:59.840
impart an irresistible
movements to society.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.222
There is that kind of
deterministic language again

00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:05.570
against which he,
the statesman,

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.829
can do nothing and yet he
begins this--he begins that

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:12.465
little statement by saying that
after a thousand efforts he

00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:16.164
succeeds in exerting an indirect
influence on the destiny of

00:41:16.164 --> 00:41:19.800
nations and then he is
celebrated as a great genius.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.130
You can see Tocqueville's irony
and what appears to be

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:28.869
downplaying the abilities or the
role of the legislator,

00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:33.461
the statesman,
to effect change of any

00:41:33.461 --> 00:41:35.820
significant kind.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:43.783
I don't like to be political
but one might wonder what our

00:41:43.783 --> 00:41:47.945
President would have made of
that had he read that passage or

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:51.968
thought about it or those around
him had thought about it a

00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:56.130
couple of years ago before our
current miseries began.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:01.216
Anyway, this passage almost
seems to be mocking the claims

00:42:01.216 --> 00:42:06.660
of Machiavelli or Rousseau who
saw the ability of a new prince

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.480
or a legislator to found peoples
and institutions.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.489
Tocqueville seems to regard
that the legislator can do

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:20.255
relatively little on his own but
is strongly hemmed in by a host

00:42:20.255 --> 00:42:23.616
of factors,
geography, social customs,

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:27.639
morality, again,
over which one can do little.

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:32.525
The legislator is more like a
ship's captain dependent on the

00:42:32.525 --> 00:42:37.329
external circumstances that
control the fate of the ship and

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:41.888
he even goes on to say the
legislator resembles a man who

00:42:41.888 --> 00:42:45.960
plots his course in the middle
of the ocean.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.857
Thus, he can direct the vessel
that carries him but he cannot

00:42:49.857 --> 00:42:52.976
change its structure,
create winds or prevent the

00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:55.380
ocean from rising under his
feet.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:00.489
All of this seems to be on the
side of those historical

00:43:00.489 --> 00:43:03.989
features that limit what we can
do.

00:43:03.989 --> 00:43:08.690
Yet, if Tocqueville often
writes as if the statesman is

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.519
hemmed in by these kinds of
circumstances,

00:43:12.519 --> 00:43:17.823
he also, and you see this
especially throughout Volume 2,

00:43:17.823 --> 00:43:22.314
strongly opposes all systems,
all intellectual or

00:43:22.314 --> 00:43:26.158
philosophical systems of
historical determinism,

00:43:26.158 --> 00:43:29.840
that deny to us the power of
human agency.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.809
While he sometimes writes to
shame or to humble the

00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:38.966
pretensions of human greatness,
he is just as concerned about

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:42.377
the tendency,
in fact the very dangerous

00:43:42.377 --> 00:43:47.451
tendency toward self-abnegation
that denies the role of the

00:43:47.451 --> 00:43:50.949
individual in politics and
history.

00:43:50.949 --> 00:43:56.270
He often writes as if it is the
peculiarity of democratic times

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:01.419
when all peoples are considered
equal and therefore all of us

00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:06.739
considered equally powerless to
effect or change anything.

00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:11.203
And again, I would ask who has
not felt this way at some time,

00:44:11.203 --> 00:44:14.513
maybe all the time,
that with all of us being,

00:44:14.513 --> 00:44:18.469
again, more or less equal no
one seems to have the power,

00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:22.184
a kind of singular power,
to effect any great social

00:44:22.184 --> 00:44:24.832
change.
There is one wonderful chapter

00:44:24.832 --> 00:44:27.489
among others but I'll just
mention one.

00:44:27.489 --> 00:44:31.752
Look at the chapter,
and I can't recall offhand the

00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:36.076
exact number of the chapter,
but the one called "On

00:44:36.076 --> 00:44:40.493
Historians," on the role of
historians in democratic and

00:44:40.493 --> 00:44:44.202
aristocratic times,
and how he shows us that in

00:44:44.202 --> 00:44:48.446
aristocratic ages--he's thinking
particularly of the ancient

00:44:48.446 --> 00:44:52.762
world--historians attributed to
extraordinary individuals all

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:57.294
the power to affect nations and
change nations but in democratic

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:59.348
times,
in modern times,

00:44:59.348 --> 00:45:03.473
we tend to think of historians,
one might also take his term

00:45:03.473 --> 00:45:06.900
"historian" to include social
science as well.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.286
We tend to project systems
which deny the power,

00:45:11.286 --> 00:45:14.739
the unique power of the
individual.

00:45:14.739 --> 00:45:18.131
We are all products of vast,
you might say,

00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:22.007
historical or causal
circumstances over which the

00:45:22.007 --> 00:45:26.248
individual has no control.
Think of the way in which

00:45:26.248 --> 00:45:29.011
Marxism, again,
denies the power of the

00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:32.963
individual,
Freudian analysis sees all of

00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:38.729
our desires and motives as
determined by forces over which

00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:43.764
we have little control,
all kinds of economic theories

00:45:43.764 --> 00:45:47.371
of development,
again, which see us all acting

00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:51.940
under certain kind of uniform
rules of human behavior.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.409
Where is the room for the
individual?

00:45:55.409 --> 00:45:59.874
That chapter is a wonderful
illustration of Tocqueville's

00:45:59.874 --> 00:46:04.027
general point.
So what is then his teaching

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:09.062
and, more specifically,
what is his advice for the

00:46:09.062 --> 00:46:14.287
statecraft of the future?
And it seems by the end of the

00:46:14.287 --> 00:46:18.670
book Tocqueville is walking on a
very narrow tightrope.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.402
He wishes to convince his
contemporaries that the

00:46:22.402 --> 00:46:26.617
democratic age is upon us,
that the transition from

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:30.013
aristocracy to democracy is
irreversible,

00:46:30.013 --> 00:46:34.548
that it cannot be resisted,
and that what he calls the

00:46:34.548 --> 00:46:37.990
democratic revolution is an
accomplished fact,

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.350
and yet at the same time he
wants to instruct us that what

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:47.092
form democracy will take in the
future will very much depend on

00:46:47.092 --> 00:46:49.296
will,
on intelligence,

00:46:49.296 --> 00:46:52.512
on what he sometimes calls
enlightenment,

00:46:52.512 --> 00:46:56.130
and especially on individual
human agency,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.239
what form democracy will take.
Democracy may be inevitable.

00:47:00.239 --> 00:47:04.713
Equality, the age of equality,
may be inevitable but democracy

00:47:04.713 --> 00:47:08.249
is not of all one piece.
It depends not just on

00:47:08.249 --> 00:47:12.619
impersonal historical forces but
on what you might call "the

00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:16.915
active virtue and intelligence
of individuals" ranging from

00:47:16.915 --> 00:47:21.360
self-interest rightly understood
to honor and ambition.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.901
Democracy can still take many
forms and whether it will favor

00:47:25.901 --> 00:47:29.837
liberty or be favorable to
liberty or to some kind of

00:47:29.837 --> 00:47:34.000
collectivism is for him very
much an open question,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.073
what form democracy will take.
And Tocqueville returns to this

00:47:38.073 --> 00:47:40.727
theme, his very,
very important theme,

00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:43.452
in the last,
very last paragraph of his

00:47:43.452 --> 00:47:45.815
book.
"I am not unaware," he tells

00:47:45.815 --> 00:47:49.576
his readers, "that several of my
contemporaries have thought that

00:47:49.576 --> 00:47:52.750
peoples are never masters of
themselves here below.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.878
There is little we can do.
And that they necessarily obey

00:47:56.878 --> 00:48:00.869
I do not know which
insurmountable and unintelligent

00:48:00.869 --> 00:48:05.174
force born of previous events,
the race, the soil or the

00:48:05.174 --> 00:48:07.521
climate."
"Those," he says,

00:48:07.521 --> 00:48:11.571
"are false and cowardly
doctrines that can never produce

00:48:11.571 --> 00:48:15.400
anything but weak men and
pusillanimous nations."

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.519
That is to say,
these doctrines of historical

00:48:18.519 --> 00:48:21.780
determinism have an actual
effect on people.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.099
It makes us weak.
It makes us cowardly.

00:48:24.099 --> 00:48:29.071
It makes us--it makes entire
societies and it enervates

00:48:29.071 --> 00:48:32.570
entire society and yet he
continues,

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:38.044
"Providence has not created the
entire race entirely independent

00:48:38.044 --> 00:48:41.891
or perfectly enslaved.
It traces it is true," he is

00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:45.285
speaking about providence.
"It traces, it is true,

00:48:45.285 --> 00:48:49.782
a fatal circle around each man
that he cannot leave but within

00:48:49.782 --> 00:48:53.100
this vast limits man is powerful
and free,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:57.309
so too, he says, with people.
Tocqueville leaves us,

00:48:57.309 --> 00:49:00.641
in other words,
not with a solution but rather

00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:05.380
with a paradox or I would say a
challenge for us to consider.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.199
We are determined but not
altogether so.

00:49:09.199 --> 00:49:13.694
The statesman must know how to
navigate the shoals between

00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:18.661
historical, social and cultural
forces over which we have no say

00:49:18.661 --> 00:49:22.604
and those matters of
institutional design and moral

00:49:22.604 --> 00:49:27.019
suasion that are still within
our power to effect.

00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:30.498
Politics, as intelligent people
have always known,

00:49:30.498 --> 00:49:34.688
which is not to say all people
to be sure but as intelligent

00:49:34.688 --> 00:49:38.894
people have known,
is a medium that takes place

00:49:38.894 --> 00:49:42.391
within language.
It is a matter of providing

00:49:42.391 --> 00:49:46.736
people with the linguistic and
the rhetorical abilities both to

00:49:46.736 --> 00:49:50.519
construct their pasts and to
imagine their futures.

00:49:50.519 --> 00:49:53.122
It is language,
going back to Aristotle,

00:49:53.122 --> 00:49:56.392
it is logos,
it is language that gives us a

00:49:56.392 --> 00:49:59.744
latitude,
an ability to adapt to changing

00:49:59.744 --> 00:50:02.789
circumstances and to create new
ones.

00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:07.306
Tocqueville provides us living
in a democratic age with the

00:50:07.306 --> 00:50:11.590
language to shape the future of
democratic societies.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.205
What we do with that language,
how we apply it to new

00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:19.098
circumstances and conditions
that Tocqueville could never

00:50:19.098 --> 00:50:23.161
have imagined,
will be of course entirely up

00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:26.017
to us.
And on that note I have to end

00:50:26.017 --> 00:50:30.371
Tocqueville and Wednesday I'll
see you for our last class and

00:50:30.371 --> 00:50:34.000
I'm going to talk about where we
go from there.

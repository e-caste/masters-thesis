00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.137
Prof: Okay,
so as you remember,

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.892
before we ended,
we were talking about Sachse

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:09.703
and how he explained everything
in more detail than people

00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:11.108
wanted to hear about.
 

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:11.710
Okay?
 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.529
And he knew exactly the story;
that you had chairs of

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.298
cyclohexane, and you had boat,
and you could interconvert them

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:20.400
by rotation about single bonds.
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.455
But it was only after the
Braggs had determined the X-ray

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:30.628
structure of diamond,
and Mohr, not equally

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:33.260
importantly but very
importantly,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.760
had drawn clear pictures of it,
like this,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.350
that people understood what
Sachse had been talking about

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.564
twenty-eight years earlier.
 

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:44.220
Okay?
 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.011
Because if we look in the
middle there,

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.728
we see that chair form of
cyclohexane.

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:50.390
Okay?
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.940
We call it a chair.
 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.690
People like to give sort of
silly, trivial names to things.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.380
Scientists are probably sort of
geeks, actually;

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.090
but that's okay.
 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.710
So there's a chair -- right?
 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.989
-- that looks like this chair.
 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.293
And that chair has a particular
property, which is you can fold

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:11.655
the back down and fold the legs
up.

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:12.280
Okay?
 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.917
But you can do the same thing,
to do the ring flip,

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.462
as we call it,
in chair cyclohexane,

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:21.810
by counter-rotation of two
parallel bonds.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.909
So take these two bonds there,
rotate it that way,

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.159
and there rotate that way;
counter-rotation, right?

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.510
One rotates clockwise,
the other counter-clockwise.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.798
And you rotate group four,
at the bottom right,

00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:37.300
so that it goes up.
 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.340
Everybody see how the rotation
does that?

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.349
And I can do it with a model
here.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.080
Right?
 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.393
So I rotate around this bond
and this bond,

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.997
hold this part here,
and I rotate,

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:51.181
and it goes up.
 

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:51.970
Okay?
 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.470
Now, so the product,
after rotating that up,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.019
is a different conformation,
which we call boat cyclohexane,

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:05.930
or which people call boat
cyclohexane,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.796
because it looks a little like
a boat.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:09.340
Okay?
 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.152
And people who got very
imaginative named various bonds

00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:15.860
on this;
like the bowsprit,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.750
or the flagpole.
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.223
But, in fact,
this isn't really a

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:24.009
conformation at all,
because it's not a minimum of

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.870
energy, it's a maximum of
energy.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.020
You get lower energy -- this is
the boat -- you get lower energy

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.882
by twisting a little bit,
like that.

00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:35.699
Right?
 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.710
So the boat is actually not a
minimum of energy.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.931
Usually we reserve the name
"conformation"

00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.268
for isomers that are minima in
energy.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:44.900
Right?
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.800
They can vibrate,
but they're at a minimum of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.190
energy.
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.378
That's not true of the boat.
 

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:51.097
But the boat is what Sachse
made his picture of,

00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:52.889
and it's easy to think about.
 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.568
So we often talk about the
boat, even if it isn't true;

00:02:55.568 --> 00:02:57.560
if it really wants to twist a
little bit.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.195
We'll discuss that a little bit
more later, why it wants to

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:00.560
twist.
 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.060
But anyhow, there's a boat.
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.318
Now, if you then did the same
trick to the blue bonds,

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:10.520
on the other side -- that is,
counter-rotate so those go in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.014
and down,
rather than in and up,

00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:15.599
as the red ones did on the left
--

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.419
it goes down like that.
 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.282
And now you see what you have
is a chair where everything that

00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:24.195
was up is down,
and everything that was down is

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:24.385
up.
 

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:25.020
Okay?
 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.919
So we started with a boat here.
 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.750
I can flip it like that to make
a capsized boat;

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.720
or a chair, start with a chair.
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.229
Flip it to make a capsized boat.
 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.940
Flip it again and I have
another chair.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.220
But notice what happened.
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.889
Here all these bonds that are
pointing vertical,

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.794
or down and vertical,
are black, and the others are

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:46.341
silver.
 

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:47.199
Right?
 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.340
Everybody see that?
 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.818
But after I do this,
they've changed;

00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:55.682
the silver ones point up and
down, and the black ones point

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:55.949
out.
 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:56.550
Right?
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.180
So that's changed the
environment.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.600
That's interchanged the
environment of this one and this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.378
one, of the black and the metal
one -- right?

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:08.538
-- by doing that so-called ring
flip.

00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:15.658
Okay, now you should learn how
to draw chair cyclohexanes.

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.173
That's a very popular
discipline among organic

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.637
chemists, and it shows that you
understand what's going on with

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:24.040
the conformation,
if you draw it right.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.812
And if you don't draw it right,
it shows that you don't

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:27.480
understand.
 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.220
So let's see how -- people say,
"Oh, I'm not an artist.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.519
I can't really draw it
right."

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.459
But if you understand it,
you can draw it right.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.168
The only thing you have to be
capable of doing is drawing

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:38.199
things that are parallel to one
another.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.410
That's not too big a challenge.
 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.055
Okay, so notice that the
carbon-carbon bonds are parallel

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:45.961
in pairs.
 

00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:46.870
Right?
 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.730
So the red ones are parallel,
the blue ones are parallel,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.869
and the green ones are
parallel.

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:53.490
Okay?
 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.627
Now that means when you draw
the frame it looks like this,

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:59.490
so that opposite ones are
parallel to one another.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.367
And now the only challenge is
to put the hydrogens on,

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.708
or whatever the substituents
are.

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:06.439
Right?
 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.887
And for that purpose it's worth
knowing -- noticing the symmetry

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:11.733
of the ring.
 

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:12.370
Right?
 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.822
There's a three-fold axis of
symmetry, vertical,

00:05:15.822 --> 00:05:17.658
as they've drawn it here.
 

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:18.319
Right?
 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.427
So you can rotate 120°,
a third of a circle around that

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:26.391
axis, and you can't tell that it
happened; it's symmetry.

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:27.028
Okay?
 

00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:31.769
So notice that some of the
bonds are parallel;

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:34.379
are called axial because
they're parallel.

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.115
But some of them are parallel
up, and the intervening ones are

00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:42.297
parallel down,
to keep the carbons looking

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:43.540
tetrahedral.
 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.906
Okay, so six of the hydrogen
bonds are parallel to the axis

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:48.959
of symmetry.
 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:52.997
So even if you drew the
six-membered ring in some

00:05:52.997 --> 00:05:57.166
cockeyed direction,
so that its mean plane was like

00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:58.233
this,
or like this,

00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:59.449
or like this,
or like this,

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.396
still you can see where that
axis points and make the axial

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.439
bonds parallel to that axis.
 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.882
Okay, now you have the problem
of drawing the last bond,

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:12.629
which completes the
tetrahedron.

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.660
Notice that the equatorial
bonds as they're called --

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.214
because it's sort of like the
equator, relative to the axis --

00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:21.079
they're not strictly horizontal.
 

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.720
Right?
 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.697
They go a little bit opposite
the way the red bond went on the

00:06:25.697 --> 00:06:26.610
same carbon.
 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.062
And notice in particular that
they're parallel to the

00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:35.944
next-adjacent carbon-carbon
bonds, which are shown in blue

00:06:35.944 --> 00:06:36.372
here.
 

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:37.230
Okay?
 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.387
So they make a sort of an N,
or a Z, with the next adjacent

00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:44.077
carbon-carbon bond.
 

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:44.790
Okay?
 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.437
Now, what o'clock -- if we
start from that carbon at the

00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:51.716
back left --
what direction,

00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:54.904
starting from the carbon,
do I draw a line,

00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:58.410
to draw the proper orientation
of the hydrogen,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.110
at that carbon?
 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.846
You know, one o'clock,
two o'clock,

00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:02.274
three o'clock,
eight o'clock,

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.910
seven o'clock,
nine o'clock.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.819
What o'clock?
 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.800
Think about it a second,
and then I'll ask you.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.649
Oh, we can do it like an
auction.

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:12.708
I'll go one,
two, three, four,

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:14.790
five, and you raise your hand
when I get the right one.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.230
Okay, twelve o'clock?
 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.550
one o'clock?
 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.750
two o'clock?
 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.699
three o'clock?
 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:20.819
four o'clock?
 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.379
five o'clock?
 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:23.980
six o'clock?
 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.300
seven o'clock?
 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.610
eight o'clock?
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.160
nine o'clock?
 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.850
ten o'clock?
 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.639
eleven o'clock?
 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.776
Okay, the answer is eight
o'clock.

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:37.779
Right?
 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:38.730
Well how do I know that?
 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.699
Because it's parallel to the
next-adjacent C-C bond;

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.740
there. Right?
 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.509
See the Z?
 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:51.550
So it's parallel to the
next-adjacent C-C bond.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.519
Okay, now how about there,
what o'clock?

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:56.709
one o'clock?
 

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:57.980
two o'clock?
 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.910
three o'clock?
 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.189
four o'clock?
 

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:06.560
five o'clock? Okay.
 

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.300
It's about 1:30, right?
 

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.927
-- sort of like one o'clock --
because it's parallel to the

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.552
next-adjacent C-C bonds,
which are pointing

00:08:16.552 --> 00:08:18.180
anti-parallel,
right?;

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.901
parallel, but in the opposite
direction from their nearest

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:22.490
carbon.
 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.660
Okay, try here.
 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.199
One o'clock?
 

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.329
two o'clock?
 

00:08:26.329 --> 00:08:27.879
three o'clock?
 

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:29.160
four o'clock?
 

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.459
five o'clock?
 

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:32.769
Ah, you're getting better,
right?

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:36.059
About four o'clock;
3:30 maybe.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.730
Okay, how about here?
 

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.519
One, o'clock?
 

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.970
two o'clock?
 

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.419
three o'clock?
 

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.470
Okay, two o'clock.
 

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.330
Okay, how about here?
 

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.659
One?
 

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:48.659
Two?
 

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:49.860
Three?
 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.500
Ah, I got some votes for one.
 

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.403
Now I'm going to come back and
ask what's wrong with one

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:57.115
o'clock?
 

00:08:57.115 --> 00:08:57.830
Okay?
 

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.860
There's what it is.
 

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.149
It's actually seven o'clock.
 

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.100
How is that related to one
o'clock?

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.899
It's anti-parallel, right?
 

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:08.706
If you did one o'clock,
it would have made a U with the

00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:11.950
next-adjacent bond,
rather than an N or a Z.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.259
Do you see that,
see where the mistake was?

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:19.340
Okay, so if you understand
this, if you understand that the

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.418
hydrogen is anti to the
next-adjacent C-C bond -- right?

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.958
-- then you won't draw it
wrong, you won't draw a U,

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.625
which would be eclipsed.
 

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:30.250
Right?
 

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.379
You'd draw it anti,
which makes a Z or an N.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.340
Okay, so if you understand it,
you'll draw it.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.719
So it wouldn't be surprising if
that were on some test sometime,

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:41.490
to draw a cyclohexane sometime.
 

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.248
Okay, now this got interesting
because in the 1940s and '50s,

00:09:46.248 --> 00:09:50.769
synthetic organic chemists were
very interested in steroid

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:53.172
hormones;
in the '30s,

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:54.774
'40s and '50s.
 

00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:55.690
Right?
 

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.461
And it turned out that you had
these two alcohols,

00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.538
which were called β
and α.

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:07.335
And beta is the one that came
up, toward the viewer,

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:11.278
and alpha is the one that goes
back into the paper.

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.080
But of course,
that depends on how you drew

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080
the molecule.
 

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.250
If you drew the molecule upside
down, it'd be just the opposite.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.249
But synthetic organic chemists,
who were interested in this

00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:23.421
kind of thing,
weren't bothered about this,

00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:25.489
because they always drew it the
same way.

00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:26.110
Right?
 

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.278
So they knew what they meant by
up and down.

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:33.673
But that's like names that
don't really tell you what the

00:10:33.673 --> 00:10:35.993
--
don't allow a novice to know

00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:38.374
what the structure is,
to talk α

00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:39.298
and β.
 

00:10:39.298 --> 00:10:41.476
People still talk about
α and β

00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:43.710
substituents,
the ones that point out of the

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.789
paper and into the paper,
in steroids.

00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:47.240
But you have to know the lore.
 

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.120
You have to know how people
always draw the rings,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.178
in order to know what comes out
and what comes in.

00:10:53.178 --> 00:10:55.494
So it's like cis and
trans,

00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:57.924
a little bit,
not knowing what's cis

00:10:57.924 --> 00:10:58.620
to what.
 

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.436
Baeyer, remember,
said it didn't make a

00:11:02.436 --> 00:11:08.461
difference, because there was
only one cyclohexane carboxylic

00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:08.965
acid.
 

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:10.070
Right?
 

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.760
Because if you had axial and
equatorial ones,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.432
the rings could flip and they
would interconvert and it'd all

00:11:16.432 --> 00:11:17.167
be the same.
 

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:17.840
Right?
 

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.053
So, but it's interesting that
the β and the

00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:24.269
α isomers of these
alcohols have different

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.923
reactivity.
 

00:11:24.923 --> 00:11:26.054
They are different.
 

00:11:26.054 --> 00:11:26.769
Right?
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.870
They behave differently.
 

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.340
They don't interconvert. Right?
 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.090
And you can see why that would
be so.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.033
What's the relation between the
β and the

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:35.669
α?
 

00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:38.168
Are they mirror images?
 

00:11:38.168 --> 00:11:44.470
Are their environments
identical?

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.009
Enantiotopic?
 

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:49.879
Diastereotopic?
 

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:53.548
There's an easy way to
recognize this.

00:11:53.548 --> 00:11:57.470
They exist at a chiral center,
because going around one carbon

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.620
and going around the other are
different paths;

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.326
they encounter different things
as you move along.

00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:03.769
Right?
 

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:04.990
So it's a chiral center.
 

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.610
But there are other chiral
centers in the molecule.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.674
And when you have two chiral
centers, then changing just one

00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:13.879
doesn't give the mirror image.
 

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:17.230
It gives an epimer,
not an enantiomer.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.524
So they are diastereotopic.
 

00:12:20.524 --> 00:12:21.379
Right?
 

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.822
Now, for these kinds of
problems, Derek H.R. Barton

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:27.852
invented what was called
"conformational

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.918
analysis",
in 1950.

00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:32.798
He was interested in these
steroid hormones,

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:34.136
as many people were.
 

00:12:34.136 --> 00:12:34.740
Right?
 

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.144
So conventionally these
six-membered rings were labeled

00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:40.793
A, B, C, and then the
five-membered ring D,

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.883
so people could know what they
were talking about.

00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:44.639
Right?
 

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.918
And Barton redrew ring A.
 

00:12:47.918 --> 00:12:50.080
And notice that the
β,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.306
α is
configurationally

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:53.548
diastereotopic.
 

00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:55.774
You'd have to break bonds to
make the α into

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:56.408
β.
 

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:59.615
So it doesn't surprise us that
they're different.

00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:00.149
Right?
 

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:02.190
But let's look at just how
they're different.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.890
So this is the picture,
from his paper in 1950,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.028
that Barton drew to show that
ring A;

00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:11.023
and the bracket there,
that I've drawn in,

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.919
shows where it would go on to
ring B.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.298
I've truncated his picture.
 

00:13:14.298 --> 00:13:16.610
Now I want to ask you a
question.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.934
So β goes up,
relative to the mean plane of

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:24.220
the ring, and α
goes down.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.798
And he labeled these things
e or p,

00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:31.620
for equatorial -- that's what
we still call it,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.523
as I told you,
the one that points more or

00:13:33.523 --> 00:13:35.009
less in the plane of the ring.
 

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:38.351
And he called the others
p, for polar,

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:42.149
as if it were a globe and had
an axis, the pole.

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:43.470
But we call it now axial.
 

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.230
So that's changed since he
invented this.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.041
But I think you're probably
sophisticated enough now,

00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:54.000
having had this practice,
to recognize an error in what

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.879
he drew.
 

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:58.019
Do you see what's wrong with
his pictures?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.480
Marty, what do you say?
 

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.268
Are the equatorial bonds,
do they make Z's with the

00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:22.629
carbon frame?
 

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:26.886
That is, are they anti to the
next adjacent carbon-carbon

00:14:26.886 --> 00:14:27.418
bond?
 

00:14:27.418 --> 00:14:30.528
Take an equatorial one,
like this one here.

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:34.298
Is this carbon-carbon bond
anti-parallel,

00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:38.820
at the correct o'clock,
relative to this bond?

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.168
Student:  It needs to be
more &gt;.

00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:42.070
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.740
Student:  It needs to be
more like eleven-ish.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.414
Prof: No,
this one, notice,

00:14:46.414 --> 00:14:50.062
is exactly horizontal,
and this one is exactly

00:14:50.062 --> 00:14:51.279
horizontal.
 

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.370
So they're perfectly anti.
 

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.860
Or take this one. Right?
 

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.690
Here's its bond,
and here's the next adjacent

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.168
C-C bond, one to ten.
 

00:15:00.168 --> 00:15:02.902
And they're exactly
antiparallel.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:03.500
Okay?
 

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.509
So that's anti too.
 

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:06.289
So the equatorial ones are fine.
 

00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:07.990
How about the axial ones?
 

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.460
Do they look good?
 

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.870
Catherine, what do you say?
 

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.230
What does axial mean?
 

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.840
What's axial about it?
 

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:24.750
Maria?
 

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:30.850
Student:  The molecule
can be rotated around the axis.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.604
Prof: Okay,
what direction does that axis

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:34.217
point,
that you can rotate that

00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:36.990
six-membered ring around it and
get the same thing?

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.460
What o'clock does it point,
from the center of the ring?

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.970
Student:  So it should
point like eleven o'clock.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.350
Prof: Yeah,
about eleven o'clock.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.937
There are the sets of three
carbons that are related by

00:15:49.937 --> 00:15:53.259
that, and the axis goes at about
eleven o'clock.

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:56.500
What does that mean Maria,
about the axial bonds?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.620
Student:  That they
should also be pointing up.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.818
Prof: They should be
parallel to that axial

00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:01.471
direction.
 

00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:02.058
Right?
 

00:16:02.058 --> 00:16:06.529
So they really should be this
direction -- right?

00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:07.830
-- parallel to that axis.
 

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.812
So the very guy who invented
it, in the very paper in which

00:16:11.812 --> 00:16:14.558
he did the invention,
drew them wrong.

00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:17.104
That's not too surprising.
 

00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:17.789
Right?
 

00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:20.350
But it's interesting to note.
 

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.485
So you don't have to feel bad
when you draw it wrong the first

00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:25.298
few times.
 

00:16:25.298 --> 00:16:27.967
By the time we get to an exam,
you'll know how to draw it

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.525
right;
better than Barton did,

00:16:29.525 --> 00:16:31.009
when he published his paper.
 

00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:35.250
Okay, he got the Nobel Prize,
in 1969, for development of the

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.490
concept of conformation and its
applications in chemistry.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.777
So he didn't get the Nobel
Prize for drawing the axial

00:16:42.777 --> 00:16:43.520
bonds wrong.
 

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.080
Right?
 

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.823
What he got the Nobel Prize was
for the application,

00:16:46.823 --> 00:16:49.298
showing how important this was
in chemistry;

00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:52.698
that those axial and equatorial
groups -- hydrogens in this

00:16:52.698 --> 00:16:54.904
case;
but they could be other groups

00:16:54.904 --> 00:16:56.581
-- have different chemistry.
 

00:16:56.581 --> 00:16:57.059
Right?
 

00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:00.110
And notice the date, 1950.
 

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.818
All these things about
stereochemistry were happening

00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:05.058
within plus or minus a few years
of that.

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:08.794
We've already talked about
Bijvoet determining the absolute

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:12.916
configuration of tartaric acid;
Newman figuring out how to draw

00:17:12.916 --> 00:17:15.430
his projections,
to show conformation;

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.998
the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules;
and, as we'll see shortly,

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.915
the idea of molecular
mechanics.

00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:23.670
Okay?
 

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.990
Now, what made Baeyer say
everything was the same,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.528
although he didn't know it,
was that the ring would flip,

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:33.539
interconverting axial and
equatorial,

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:34.318
as we just looked.
 

00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:37.153
But can the ring -- if the ring
can flip in this one,

00:17:37.153 --> 00:17:40.259
it would also interconvert
axial and equatorial -- but can

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.240
the ring flip?
 

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.298
That's the question.
 

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:46.009
So let's think a little bit
more about how the ring-flip

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:46.548
works.
 

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:50.967
Notice that during a ring-flip,
as in the top left there,

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:53.650
what's equatorial becomes
axial.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.292
So you look on the top left,
there's an equatorial bond,

00:17:57.292 --> 00:18:00.338
and in the right that becomes
an axial bond;

00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:03.170
well actually you'd call it a
-- what is it?

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.818
-- flagpole, in the boat. Right?
 

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:08.415
But when you do the other flip
of the blue one,

00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:10.164
that one that's purple is
there.

00:18:10.164 --> 00:18:10.730
Right?
 

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.921
So the one that was equatorial
in the chair on the top left,

00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:15.490
after a flip becomes axial.
 

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.919
And we already saw that here,
that the ones that are

00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:22.683
equatorial become axial when you
do the double ring flip.

00:18:22.683 --> 00:18:23.288
Okay?
 

00:18:23.288 --> 00:18:28.125
Now, and by the same token,
the ones that are axial become

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:29.230
equatorial.
 

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.900
So if you start on the top left
with those two green ones,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.000
which are anti to one another,
axial --

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.368
notice they point a little to
the right because the axis of --

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.036
the symmetry axis is not
straight up and down.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:41.509
Right?
 

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:45.086
After the first part of the
flip to the boat looks like

00:18:45.086 --> 00:18:47.190
that;
and the second part of the

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.660
flip, they become equatorial,
and gauche to one another,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.615
where they were anti
originally.

00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:53.308
Right?
 

00:18:53.308 --> 00:18:57.568
So now if you have fused rings
-- that is,

00:18:57.568 --> 00:19:00.068
two six-membered rings that
share a bond,

00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:03.823
as on the bottom there -- those
two green ones can be part of

00:19:03.823 --> 00:19:06.592
the second ring;
gauche to one another,

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:10.773
as all the carbons are around
the cyclohexane ring in its

00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:11.818
chair form.
 

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.759
So they're gauche,
and that's fine.

00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:17.510
But if you tried to flip it,
those two green ones,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.338
with respect to the front ring,
would become axial,

00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:23.098
as on the top left.
 

00:19:23.098 --> 00:19:27.828
And if they pointed axial,
you couldn't possibly complete

00:19:27.828 --> 00:19:28.588
the ring.
 

00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:29.348
Right?
 

00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:34.519
So here's two chairs,
here and here.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:38.501
Now if I could try to flip this
one up -- I could flip this one

00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:41.410
down probably;
there, down. Right?

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.298
So I got it almost into a boat.
 

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:47.551
But I can't even make it into a
boat, let alone flip the other

00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:48.038
ring.
 

00:19:48.038 --> 00:19:52.662
And the reason is that these
two are tying these two -- while

00:19:52.662 --> 00:19:57.130
I'm trying to flip this one,
these two are holding this one

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.980
and won't let it go.
 

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.259
They can't become axial to one
another.

00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:02.950
Right?
 

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.348
Just because the carbons can't
reach.

00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:10.598
Okay, so in what's called --
decalin means decahydro,

00:20:10.598 --> 00:20:13.828
ten hydrogens,
on naphthalene;

00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:16.529
naphthalene is like benzene,
except two of them.

00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:16.990
Right?
 

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.861
So this is decalin,
or ten hydrogens on

00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:20.920
naphthalene.
 

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.539
And this one is called
trans-decalin.

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:26.400
Right?
 

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.269
These two hydrogens are trans
to one another.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.568
And in that one,
I can't flip the rings.

00:20:30.568 --> 00:20:34.773
If I had cis-decalin,
like this, then it's possible

00:20:34.773 --> 00:20:38.839
to flip the rings;
which I could do like this.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.589
Let's see.
 

00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:43.470
Well ho, ho, ho.
 

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.115
I think I did it there.
 

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:47.493
Yeah, I did.
 

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:48.298
Okay.
 

00:20:48.298 --> 00:20:49.618
So you can flip the ring if
it's cis,

00:20:49.618 --> 00:20:50.568
but not if it's trans.
 

00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:54.935
And the point is that you can't
take two equatorial things and

00:20:54.935 --> 00:20:58.963
make them both axial in a ring,
because those carbons get too

00:20:58.963 --> 00:21:01.660
far apart to be bridged by the
rest of the ring.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.134
But if they're gauche to one
another, then they can be gauche

00:21:05.134 --> 00:21:08.089
to one another on the other side
and it can flip.

00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:09.230
It's fun to play.
 

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.548
You know, we used to require
people to buy models.

00:21:11.548 --> 00:21:15.287
Now you can do things with
computers that make it that it's

00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:18.509
probably not worth your money to
buy the models.

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:20.287
But it's still a lot of fun,
and you learn something with

00:21:20.287 --> 00:21:20.700
your hands.
 

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.902
It's like when people have
trouble in elementary school

00:21:23.902 --> 00:21:26.194
with arithmetic;
the teacher gives them

00:21:26.194 --> 00:21:28.200
toothpicks to count with and so
on.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.690
It's a higher level than that,
but it's the same thing;

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.859
you learn a lot with your hands.
 

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.930
So it's fun to play with these.
 

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:40.675
In fact, let me pass around
here simplified models that are

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:41.838
a chair.
 

00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:46.167
But you can do this trick of
changing one into the other by

00:21:46.167 --> 00:21:46.990
rotating.
 

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.818
And feeling it is fun. Right?
 

00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:52.343
So that you have the
opportunity to feel it,

00:21:52.343 --> 00:21:53.809
I'll pass these around.
 

00:21:53.809 --> 00:22:00.789
There you go.
 

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:06.470
There you go.
 

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.378
Okay, the ring flip is
impossible for

00:22:08.378 --> 00:22:09.598
trans-decalin.
 

00:22:09.598 --> 00:22:14.818
Okay, but so gauche because
gauche is okay within the second

00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:17.650
ring of decalin,
but not anti.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.328
Okay, so and you try with
models if you're skeptical.

00:22:21.328 --> 00:22:24.060
If you want to come afterwards
and fiddle with the decalins,

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.710
you're free.
 

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.095
Okay now, nowadays people,
much more often,

00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:31.240
encounter these things on
animations.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:37.067
But this is a nice webpage that
we have permission to use in the

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:39.508
course;
I mean, you could use it on

00:22:39.508 --> 00:22:42.250
your own anyhow,
on the net if you wanted to.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.440
But it's a cautionary tale
because just because it looks

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.944
nice and works,
doesn't mean it gives the right

00:22:49.944 --> 00:22:50.859
answers.
 

00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.828
So let me show you what I mean.
 

00:22:52.828 --> 00:22:55.886
Okay, so if you go to this
website, you can click there to

00:22:55.886 --> 00:22:56.368
get it.
 

00:22:56.368 --> 00:23:00.259
And it's a nice tutorial about
conformation.

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:02.105
So they show here,
for example,

00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:04.457
ethane,
and if you click 'Play' --

00:23:04.457 --> 00:23:06.231
let's see,
I think I've got it animated

00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:08.161
here --
you can step from one position

00:23:08.161 --> 00:23:10.750
to the next and see what the
shape looks like.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.086
Not that ethane is so very
exciting, but you can see it go

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:17.190
down and up, as it goes from
eclipsed to staggered.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.109
And you can click on a point
and the model will turn,

00:23:20.109 --> 00:23:21.740
to show you what it's like.
 

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.269
I'll give an example of this
later.

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:25.598
And there's the staggered and
there's the eclipsed.

00:23:25.598 --> 00:23:27.470
That's the barrier that goes
across.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.338
And you see that that barrier
is 5.2 kJ/mole,

00:23:31.338 --> 00:23:34.240
because they use -- they're
modern and they use joules,

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.356
whereas American organic
chemists tend to use

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:37.078
kilocalories.
 

00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:40.009
But anyhow, if you multiply
that by 0.239,

00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:42.060
you get it in kilocalories,
as what we've been talking

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.594
about,
which would say that the

00:23:44.594 --> 00:23:46.960
barrier is 1.24 kcal/mol.
 

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.150
How big is the barrier in
ethane?

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.490
Does anybody remember from
before Thanksgiving?

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.259
Dana?
 

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:53.009
Student:  Three.
 

00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:54.858
Prof: It's three. Right?
 

00:23:54.858 --> 00:23:57.210
Just because they give a fancy
chart with numbers on it,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.965
and just because it's been
calculated by some quantum

00:24:00.965 --> 00:24:05.298
mechanical program that they got
access to and could use,

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:07.058
doesn't mean the numbers are
going to be right.

00:24:07.058 --> 00:24:10.371
And they're not,
they're off by a factor of more

00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:11.005
than two.
 

00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:11.640
Right?
 

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.460
So don't believe everything you
see.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.420
That's maybe the primary lesson
that this whole unit tells you.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.410
Okay, it should be 2.9.
 

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.980
So let the buyer beware in
situations like that.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.480
If you don't pay anything for
it, you probably get about that.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.657
But the pictures are still very
nice, and the general shape is

00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:31.180
correct.
 

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.086
So here's the rotation in
propane, and it says the barrier

00:24:36.086 --> 00:24:37.548
is 5 kcal/mole.
 

00:24:37.548 --> 00:24:41.334
And you know it's something
like 3.4,3.3,

00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:42.279
instead.
 

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:45.228
Here's butane,
and again you can animate that

00:24:45.228 --> 00:24:48.980
and see the various staggered
conformations and the fully

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.118
eclipsed one.
 

00:24:50.118 --> 00:24:54.079
And we know the gauche is
supposed to be 0.9 kcal/mole;

00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:55.519
which is not what this says.
 

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:59.000
And forget the scale on the
left.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.343
We can use that 0.9 to tell how
much of the gauche there should

00:25:05.343 --> 00:25:07.390
be at equilibrium.
 

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.828
And let's rehearse this again.
 

00:25:10.828 --> 00:25:14.548
Remember, it's 10^(3/4^(
)ΔH),^( )in

00:25:14.548 --> 00:25:15.710
kilocalories.
 

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:20.630
So 3/4ths^( )of 0.9 is 0.68.
 

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:28.391
So it means the ratio of gauche
to anti should be 1:4.7 (4.7 is

00:25:28.391 --> 00:25:29.518
10^0.68).
 

00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:30.519
Okay?
 

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:31.750
So 1:5, about.
 

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.924
But it depends on what you're
talking about,

00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:37.880
because that gauche is in fact
chiral.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.608
Let's see, I didn't have it
here.

00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:43.480
Well you can -- I do it with my
hands.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.470
Okay, so here's anti. Okay?
 

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.390
Here's gauche. Right?
 

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.519
But gauche is chiral.
 

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:53.450
It could also be this. Right?
 

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.920
It could be one hand,
or the other;

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.769
the mirror image.
 

00:25:56.769 --> 00:25:58.597
It's like a propeller of
gauche.

00:25:58.597 --> 00:25:59.068
Right?
 

00:25:59.068 --> 00:26:02.210
So when I say gauche,
what do I mean?

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.615
Do I mean gauche+,
or do I mean gauche-,

00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:09.460
or do I mean both of them,
taken together?

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.271
Because obviously,
if I include -- if I say gauche

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:15.838
and mean both of them -- right?
 

00:26:15.838 --> 00:26:20.741
-- then I have to multiply this
by two, and the ratio is 1:2.4,

00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:22.086
instead of 1:4.7.
 

00:26:22.086 --> 00:26:22.720
Okay?
 

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.496
So there has to be this
statistical factor taken into

00:26:26.496 --> 00:26:29.836
account as well,
when you use a collective name

00:26:29.836 --> 00:26:31.000
like gauche.
 

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.788
Okay, the eclipsed is 3.4
kcal/mole.

00:26:35.788 --> 00:26:40.490
That will tell how fast anti
goes to gauche.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.769
So the difference in the well
heights,

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:45.990
tells how much gauche there is
at the equilibrium,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.539
and the barrier height tells
how fast you go,

00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:49.858
from one to the other.
 

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:52.670
So how fast do you go from anti
to gauche?

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.880
Do you remember how to do that?
 

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.809
Anybody remember?
 

00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:04.250
Chenyu, do you remember how to
do it?

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.608
Student:  How to do what?
 

00:27:05.608 --> 00:27:07.999
Prof: How to find out
how fast something is,

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:10.819
if you know how big the barrier
is you have to go across?

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:11.990
Student:  I'm not sure.
 

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.761
Prof: No,
but you'll know it for the

00:27:13.761 --> 00:27:14.099
final.
 

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:14.868
Student:  I'm sure.
 

00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:15.813
Prof: Okay?
 

00:27:15.813 --> 00:27:18.250
It's (10^13th)/second;
pretty fast.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.921
But then slowed down by that
same kind of equilibrium

00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:25.308
constant, 10^(-3/4 of how big
the barrier is).

00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:27.875
Now, if the barrier is 3.4 --
say it was four,

00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:30.259
say the barrier's four;
it's about that.

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:33.538
10^3/4ths^( )of four is 10^3rd.
 

00:27:33.538 --> 00:27:34.279
Right?
 

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.480
So it's slowed down by 10^3.
 

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.479
It's 10^13th/second times
10^-3.

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:42.769
Right?
 

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:44.849
So it's 10^10th per second.
 

00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:46.299
Okay, there it is.
 

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:47.099
Oops, I did it wrong.
 

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.038
What did I do wrong here?
 

00:27:55.038 --> 00:27:56.400
Student:  You said four
instead of 3/4ths.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.210
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.480
Student:  You made it
four instead of 3/4ths.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.430
Prof: That's not the
difference though.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.160
I think I've got a typo here.
 

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.240
That can happen.
 

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.914
Okay, anyhow,
I think -- subject to thinking

00:28:11.914 --> 00:28:17.385
while I'm not on my feet -- that
this should be about 10^10th per

00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:17.984
second.
 

00:28:17.984 --> 00:28:18.838
Okay?
 

00:28:18.838 --> 00:28:22.038
Anyhow, you see how you would
use it.

00:28:22.038 --> 00:28:22.750
Right?
 

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.140
10^13th times -- whoops,
oh I forgot to plug;

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.039
no, I did plug it in.
 

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.049
Oh, it's okay.
 

00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:32.548
Okay, so there we go. Okay?
 

00:28:32.548 --> 00:28:37.548
And the fully eclipsed barrier
is about 4.4 kcal/mole.

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:40.992
But that's hard to access
experimentally.

00:28:40.992 --> 00:28:41.509
Why?
 

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:45.846
Because experimentally you try
to tell how fast one thing goes

00:28:45.846 --> 00:28:46.630
to another.
 

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.269
Right?
 

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:51.632
But it's possible to get from
anti to gauche without going

00:28:51.632 --> 00:28:54.801
over that barrier,
and it's possible to go from

00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:57.480
gauche to anti without going
over that barrier.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.535
To go from gauche to gauche,
do you have -- notice that

00:29:01.535 --> 00:29:03.864
360° is the same as 0°.
 

00:29:03.864 --> 00:29:04.538
Right?
 

00:29:04.538 --> 00:29:07.056
So you can go from this gauche
to this gauche,

00:29:07.056 --> 00:29:08.566
by going over that barrier.
 

00:29:08.566 --> 00:29:09.068
Right?
 

00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:12.700
So can you measure that rate
and see what that barrier is?

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.710
No, because there's an easier
way to go.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.064
Instead of going like this,
to get from one gauche to the

00:29:20.064 --> 00:29:21.799
other, you just go like this.
 

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:22.338
Right?
 

00:29:22.338 --> 00:29:23.720
So there's an easier way to do
it.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.278
So you can't measure the rate
and know what that barrier is.

00:29:26.278 --> 00:29:29.000
That barrier is more or less
irrelevant experimentally.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.098
Okay, or here's the ring flip
in cyclohexane.

00:29:34.098 --> 00:29:37.484
Now let me -- I'll use this one
to animate it,

00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:38.838
to show you how.
 

00:29:38.838 --> 00:29:40.450
You can try this program
yourself.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.769
Okay, so here we go.
 

00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:44.578
And there's the thing doing its
ring-flip.

00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:48.074
And it's nice because you can
grab it and rotate it around and

00:29:48.074 --> 00:29:51.740
see it from different points of
view as it does its ring-flip.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.795
So there's flipping one end
down, and then flipping the

00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:58.798
other end up,
to go from one chair to the

00:29:58.798 --> 00:29:59.549
other.
 

00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:01.298
So you can fiddle with this.
 

00:30:01.298 --> 00:30:03.750
Or you can get models and try
them too.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.685
Okay or, as I said,
you can go -- we could stop

00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:12.906
that -- and you can go over here
and see what it looks like at

00:30:12.906 --> 00:30:14.788
the halfway point.
 

00:30:14.788 --> 00:30:17.588
Now notice that that is a
little bit like a boat.

00:30:17.588 --> 00:30:21.170
But it's a twisted boat,
as I said, because the actual

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.130
boat is up here at the top.
 

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.222
In fact, even at the top it's
not -- oh, pardon me,

00:30:26.222 --> 00:30:27.769
I said the wrong thing.
 

00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:33.101
It's not -- up at the top,
it's sort of a half chair,

00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:34.126
half boat.
 

00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:35.048
Right?
 

00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:39.119
This top left carbon is still
in the sort of chair-like form,

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:41.019
or these five carbons are.
 

00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:45.403
But this one is halfway bent
up, toward a boat.

00:30:45.403 --> 00:30:46.068
Okay?
 

00:30:46.068 --> 00:30:48.250
Anyhow, you can fiddle with
those things.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:53.569
Oh let's see -- what do I need
to do here?

00:30:53.569 --> 00:30:56.170
Go back here. Okay.
 

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.750
So there's the chair conformer,
there's the flexible or

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.410
twisted-boat conformer.
 

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:02.910
Now that one is really fun.
 

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.932
I'm going to do it here,
and you people who have this

00:31:05.932 --> 00:31:06.630
can do it.
 

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.255
Notice -- did you notice when
you played with this,

00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:11.038
that the chair is sort of
rigid.

00:31:11.038 --> 00:31:12.528
If you try to twist it,
it's hard.

00:31:12.528 --> 00:31:15.009
Has everybody felt it,
to feel that?

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:17.842
But if you get into the boat
form, like that,

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.578
then it's quite flexible.
 

00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:21.609
You can do this,
to your heart's content.

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:22.400
Did you feel that?
 

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.233
After you've passed it across,
pass it back so everybody can

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:30.430
feel how -- this is great,
like the orb.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.250
Right?
 

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.586
But the chair is quite rigid.
 

00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:34.150
Right?
 

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:40.075
And as it goes from chair to
boat, it clicks;

00:31:40.075 --> 00:31:41.557
like click.
 

00:31:41.557 --> 00:31:43.307
See it click?
 

00:31:43.307 --> 00:31:44.519
Okay.
 

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.769
So there's a barrier;
that's the point.

00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:49.227
But in the flexible form
there's not a barrier,

00:31:49.227 --> 00:31:50.670
it just smoothly rotates.
 

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.240
Okay, so there's that barrier
of 11 kcal/mol.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.038
So it takes some time to get
back and forth.

00:31:57.038 --> 00:32:01.444
Okay, and here's the flexible
one, and you can animate that

00:32:01.444 --> 00:32:02.811
and watch it flex.
 

00:32:02.811 --> 00:32:03.420
Okay?
 

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.108
So that's the twist-boat form.
 

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:09.022
Okay, now we're going to talk
about the shape,

00:32:09.022 --> 00:32:12.588
strain energy,
and molecular mechanics.

00:32:12.588 --> 00:32:14.660
The point is to talk about
molecular mechanics.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.098
How do you get these energies?
 

00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:20.467
That particular animation used
a quantum mechanical

00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:21.690
calculation.
 

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.903
It didn't do a very good job on
the energies,

00:32:23.903 --> 00:32:24.910
as we just showed.
 

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.568
But is there an easier way to
get these energies?

00:32:27.568 --> 00:32:29.278
And there is,
and it's called molecular

00:32:29.278 --> 00:32:29.818
mechanics.
 

00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:34.268
Essentially it's just using
Hooke's Law for the model,

00:32:34.268 --> 00:32:36.868
to calculate strain energies.
 

00:32:36.868 --> 00:32:42.130
So we already saw the torsional
energy of ethane at 3 kcal/mole

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.051
--
a threefold barrier,

00:32:44.051 --> 00:32:46.750
three minima,
as you go across -- and the

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.598
conformational energy of butane.
 

00:32:48.598 --> 00:32:53.190
And it's fun to remember those
numbers: 0.9 for anti to gauche;

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:56.079
3.4 barrier between them,
and then maybe 4.4,

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:58.380
but who knows,
for the other one.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.650
Okay, now remember 1950 is when
all these things were happening.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.454
So in 1946 there was a paper by
Frank Westheimer and Joseph

00:33:06.454 --> 00:33:09.078
Mayer from the University of
Chicago,

00:33:09.078 --> 00:33:13.406
about using mechanics to
calculate the energies of

00:33:13.406 --> 00:33:14.818
conformations.
 

00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:18.097
The particular thing they were
interested in is when you have

00:33:18.097 --> 00:33:20.829
two benzene rings hooked
together, so that they can

00:33:20.829 --> 00:33:21.758
rotate like this.
 

00:33:21.758 --> 00:33:22.358
Right?
 

00:33:22.358 --> 00:33:25.660
They can't rotate freely if you
have things here that are

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.780
sticking out,
that would run into one

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.902
another, as you tried to rotate
them.

00:33:29.902 --> 00:33:30.608
Right?
 

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:33.849
So you could get one that's
twisted this way and one that's

00:33:33.849 --> 00:33:36.420
twisted this way,
in a substituted biphenyl.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.579
And you can resolve them,
and get optically active forms

00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:40.654
--
one that's twisted to the

00:33:40.654 --> 00:33:42.038
right, one that's twisted to the
left --

00:33:42.038 --> 00:33:44.549
even though you don't have a
carbon that has four different

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:47.640
things on it;
because it can't rotate. Right?

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.190
But the question is,
how big should that barrier be?

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:56.145
And Westheimer,
in fact, is your great-uncle.

00:33:56.145 --> 00:33:57.230
Right?
 

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.699
Because he also studied with
Conant and Kohler,

00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:03.478
at Harvard;
the same as my teacher,

00:34:03.478 --> 00:34:04.571
Bartlett, did.
 

00:34:04.571 --> 00:34:05.118
Okay?
 

00:34:05.118 --> 00:34:07.826
So he was interested in
physical-organic chemistry and

00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:08.389
did this.
 

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.369
Incidentally,
he's also the guy that figured

00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:14.489
out which hydrogen you pull off
on ethanol;

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:18.355
you know, that enzymes choose
between the pro-R and the

00:34:18.355 --> 00:34:19.940
pro-S hydrogens.
 

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.811
So anyhow, Westheimer did this
in 1946 and figured if you have

00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:26.159
a bromine here and a bromine
here,

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.125
that when it's flat,
and achiral,

00:34:28.125 --> 00:34:31.563
that's the transition state
between being twisted one way

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:34.393
and being twisted the other;
that -- whoops,

00:34:34.393 --> 00:34:37.789
sorry -- that these two things
would run into one another.

00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:41.125
That would mean the bonds might
bend back a little bit or

00:34:41.125 --> 00:34:43.300
something;
how much energy would that cost?

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.400
So he tried to do it by what's
called molecular mechanics.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.570
So these programs calculate the
energy,

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.300
and they can minimize it by
adjusting angles to get the

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.735
minimum energy,
by treating these molecules as

00:34:55.735 --> 00:34:57.840
if they were mechanical.
 

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.380
And to achieve useful precision
they require a very large set of

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.405
empirical force constants;
that is, how strong are the

00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:07.670
various springs?
 

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.130
And you adjust these
arbitrarily on some test

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.375
molecules, in order to get the
best values, and then try to

00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.110
apply it to something else.
 

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.641
You can also do it nowadays by
reliable -- unlike the ones we

00:35:18.641 --> 00:35:21.880
just talked about -- quantum
mechanical calculations.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.476
But I want to show you how many
parameters there are,

00:35:25.476 --> 00:35:27.829
when you do molecular
mechanics.

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:32.619
Okay, so this is so-called MM2
-- that's a particular molecular

00:35:32.619 --> 00:35:36.250
mechanics scheme -- and these
are parameters.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.079
So there are sixty-six
different atom types;

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:43.483
fourteen different types of
carbon, depending on what it's

00:35:43.483 --> 00:35:44.409
bonded to.
 

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:47.980
Okay, so here are some of --
here are the fourteen different

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.070
types of carbon.
 

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.396
The carbon in an alkane,
in an alkene,

00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:52.340
in an alkyne.
 

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.980
That carbon in a carbon cation.
 

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.659
The carbon in a carbonyl group.
 

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:57.699
The carbon in a carboxylate;
and so on.

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:00.170
And these have different van
der Waals radii;

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.259
which is one of the things you
have to put in.

00:36:03.259 --> 00:36:03.739
Okay?
 

00:36:03.739 --> 00:36:07.311
Now, then you have these
various kinds of atoms hooked

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:11.288
together, and you have a certain
strength for stretching the

00:36:11.288 --> 00:36:12.030
spring.
 

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:18.128
That is to say you need what
the equilibrium bond distance

00:36:18.128 --> 00:36:20.686
is,
the minimum energy bond

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:24.769
distance, and how strong the
force constant is,

00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:26.309
for stretching that spring.
 

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:30.650
So notice there are 138
different bond stretchings.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.726
These are just the ones that
involve where the first atom is

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:35.556
of type one.
 

00:36:35.556 --> 00:36:36.110
Okay?
 

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.615
So you need to find out what
all those force constants are.

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:41.159
Okay.
 

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:44.904
Then you can bend bonds,
and there are 624 different

00:36:44.904 --> 00:36:49.309
strengths of springs for bending
different types of bonds.

00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:52.536
Forty-one, shown here,
involve alkane carbon,

00:36:52.536 --> 00:36:55.690
alkane carbon,
and then some other group;

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.300
it could be another alkane
carbon.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.603
That's the very top one;
one, one one is three alkane

00:37:00.603 --> 00:37:01.309
carbons.
 

00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:04.949
So that's the force constant
for bending the bond.

00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:09.409
But then there are different
equilibrium bond angles;

00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:14.079
all close to 109.5 -- remember,
that's the tetrahedral angle --

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:17.409
but a little bit different,
according to whether that

00:37:17.409 --> 00:37:20.610
particular carbon has two other
R groups on it,

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.677
or an R group and an H,
or two Hs, in addition to the

00:37:23.677 --> 00:37:27.570
other two groups you're talking
about actually bending the bond.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.498
So you get -- so there are --
so then, of course,

00:37:31.498 --> 00:37:33.710
you can twist bonds also.
 

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.260
That's what conformation
involves, after all.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.639
And there are 1494 different
bond-twisting,

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:44.469
and for each bond-twisting you
have three parameters here.

00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:46.887
For example,
V3 -- also V2,

00:37:46.887 --> 00:37:52.750
V1 -- for each of those 1500
whatever number it was of bonds.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.030
I'll just show you what that
means.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.309
V3 means a threefold barrier.
 

00:37:57.309 --> 00:38:05.119
And it says its height is 0.093
kcal -- yeah,

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:07.250
kcal/mole.
 

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.610
So here it is. Right?
 

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.099
It's maximum when it's
eclipsed, it's minimum when it's

00:38:11.099 --> 00:38:13.360
staggered, maximum eclipsed,
minimum staggered.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.599
So that's a threefold barrier,
for rotating.

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:20.184
But there's also,
for a particular kind of set of

00:38:20.184 --> 00:38:24.742
three bonds, there's a twofold
barrier, which looks like that.

00:38:24.742 --> 00:38:25.489
Right?
 

00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:28.266
And that one,
you see, is 0.27 kilocalories

00:38:28.266 --> 00:38:28.730
high.
 

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.034
And there's also a one-fold
barrier, like that,

00:38:33.034 --> 00:38:37.619
which is, for that particular
one, alkane, alkane,

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:41.550
alkane, alkane,
0.2 kilocalories high.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.380
Now you add all these together,
and that is the torsional

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.050
contribution to the energy in
butane;

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.887
or anything where you have
alkane, alkane,

00:38:50.887 --> 00:38:51.925
alkane, alkane.
 

00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:52.550
Right?
 

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.739
Now we know what it really
looks like in butane.

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:55.860
It looks like that.
 

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.599
The scale is much bigger.
 

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:00.000
So this is a rather minor
contribution.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.831
Now why is it that the anti is
the most stable,

00:39:03.831 --> 00:39:06.079
according to this scheme?
 

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:10.106
It's because it's -- the van
der Waals repulsion is least

00:39:10.106 --> 00:39:14.420
when these two carbons are as
far apart from one another,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.940
rather than being eclipsed with
one another.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.409
Right?
 

00:39:17.409 --> 00:39:21.751
But that then is biased -- you
calculate that van der Waals

00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:25.871
repulsion, which depends on the
radii of various things.

00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:26.619
Right?
 

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:32.929
And you then tweak it by adding
this to it, as well.

00:39:32.929 --> 00:39:33.920
Right?
 

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.862
So you can see that these are
pretty complicated -- I mean,

00:39:35.862 --> 00:39:37.070
for a computer it's not a
problem.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.927
It's a lot easier than quantum
mechanics, finding all these

00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:41.059
curvatures and stuff.
 

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:44.708
But it's still a pretty
intricate thing and an enormous

00:39:44.708 --> 00:39:46.329
numbers of parameters.
 

00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:50.005
After simplification,
the so called MM3 scheme has

00:39:50.005 --> 00:39:54.206
more than 2000 arbitrarily
adjustable parameters that you

00:39:54.206 --> 00:39:58.708
have to fiddle out by knowing a
lot of different experimental

00:39:58.708 --> 00:39:59.760
results.
 

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.389
And what would I have to make
the numbers to make that right?

00:40:02.389 --> 00:40:04.072
And then it has to be also
right with this one,

00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:04.840
this one, this one.
 

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.403
So obviously you need at least
2000 different molecules to

00:40:08.403 --> 00:40:11.905
determine 2000 parameters,
or 2000 different measurements

00:40:11.905 --> 00:40:12.719
at least.
 

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:15.849
So it's a very highly
parameterized system.

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.833
Contrast it with quantum
mechanics, where there are no

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:22.047
arbitrary parameters;
all you have is the particle

00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:25.063
masses, their charges,
and Planck's constant.

00:40:25.063 --> 00:40:25.679
Right?
 

00:40:25.679 --> 00:40:28.420
So there's nothing
fundamentally correct about

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.760
molecular mechanics.
 

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.108
It's just a very complicated
scheme that's been tweaked to

00:40:33.108 --> 00:40:36.751
try to give good results for the
molecules that it's tweaked on

00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:37.750
the basis of.
 

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.407
But that doesn't necessarily
mean it'll work for anything

00:40:40.407 --> 00:40:40.739
else.
 

00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:42.639
But it does work pretty well.
 

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.759
And the nice thing about it is
by looking at the calculations,

00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:48.929
you can figure out why
things happen the way they do.

00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:50.817
For example,
here's ideal cyclohexane,

00:40:50.817 --> 00:40:52.449
the way we've been drawing it.
 

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:55.226
And we can look at the various
kinds of strain that there are

00:40:55.226 --> 00:40:55.690
in that.
 

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.500
First we take an ideal
cyclohexane;

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.255
which means it has ideal bond
lengths, bond angles,

00:41:02.255 --> 00:41:04.282
and is staggered,
like this.

00:41:04.282 --> 00:41:04.960
Okay?
 

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.639
And there's no strain for
stretch, bend,

00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:11.659
or what's called stretch-bend.
 

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:14.880
Why is there a term called
stretch-bend?

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.771
Because when you stretch a bond
-- it might be easier to bend,

00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:22.090
or conceivably harder to bend
when it's stretched.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.809
So you have to put another term
in for that.

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:29.831
Okay, but there is torsional
energy, because there are gauche

00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:32.760
interactions here,
like that one.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.639
But there are six of them,
as you go around the ring.

00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:36.670
So they're not anti.
 

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.409
So there's torsional energy.
 

00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:42.612
And then there's what's called
"non-1,4 van der Waals

00:41:42.612 --> 00:41:45.701
energy";
which in fact is favorable,

00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:46.876
it's attractive.
 

00:41:46.876 --> 00:41:47.389
Okay.
 

00:41:47.389 --> 00:41:50.471
And here you see an example:
one, two, three four,

00:41:50.471 --> 00:41:53.427
five, those atoms,
atom one and atom five there,

00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:54.748
are five atoms apart.
 

00:41:54.748 --> 00:41:55.440
Right?
 

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.969
So it's non-1,4; it's 1,5.
 

00:41:57.969 --> 00:42:00.902
And they're at a distance where
their interaction is attractive,

00:42:00.902 --> 00:42:02.579
according to van der Waals
energy.

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:08.014
But you can have 1,4 van der
Waals energy,

00:42:08.014 --> 00:42:09.340
as here.
 

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.128
There's one, two, three four;
and that, you see,

00:42:13.128 --> 00:42:18.516
costs you -- Its strain of 6.3
kcal/mol -- not that particular

00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:20.724
one, but sum them all up.
 

00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:21.518
Okay?
 

00:42:21.518 --> 00:42:23.731
There's a very bad one here,
you can see,

00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:25.059
between one and eight.
 

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:27.907
Those are rather close
together.

00:42:27.907 --> 00:42:28.550
Okay?
 

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.429
So there's this much strain in
that.

00:42:31.429 --> 00:42:35.003
Now, what a molecular mechanics
program can do is adjust the

00:42:35.003 --> 00:42:37.246
geometry -- twist bonds,
stretch them,

00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:39.972
bend them and so on -- to
minimize the energy.

00:42:39.972 --> 00:42:40.639
Okay?
 

00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:41.909
And here's what happens.
 

00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:47.860
Whereas the total strain energy
before deformation is almost 8

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:52.154
kcal/mole, after -- let's see,
what did I do?

00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:53.130
There.
 

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.820
After you've minimized it,
those are the energies.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.340
It falls to 6.56.
 

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.706
So it gets a kilocalorie 0.3
better.

00:43:01.706 --> 00:43:02.380
Okay?
 

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.679
Now notice what happened.
 

00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:05.699
It stretched the bonds a little
bit.

00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:09.068
It bent the bonds a little bit.
 

00:43:09.068 --> 00:43:09.829
Right?
 

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:12.400
Let's see exactly what it did,
by looking at the model.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.648
So there's the -- it's going to
stretch and flatten the ring

00:43:16.648 --> 00:43:20.610
slightly, to reduce that bad van
der Waals repulsion.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:24.172
Notice the 1,4 van der Waals
before was 6.32,

00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:26.440
and it's cut down to 4.68.
 

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.590
So watch what happens.
 

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.659
So this is -- did you see it?
 

00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:32.030
Let's back up.
 

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:36.623
See, it flattens and stretches,
just a bit, to get -- to reduce

00:43:36.623 --> 00:43:39.070
those van der Waals repulsions.
 

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:44.230
So this way I told you to draw
cyclohexane, to get it the same

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:47.867
way Mohr did,
is the way organic chemists do

00:43:47.867 --> 00:43:48.460
it.
 

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.429
But it's not quite right.
 

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:52.766
Actually the rings flatten a
little bit and the things that

00:43:52.766 --> 00:43:55.469
should be axial spread out just
a little bit.

00:43:55.469 --> 00:44:00.960
Okay, fine, so some things get
better, some things get worse;

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.659
overall it gets a little better.
 

00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:04.902
And it would be very hard to do
that in your head.

00:44:04.902 --> 00:44:05.268
Right?
 

00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:07.090
Molecular mechanics is good to
do that.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:12.836
Okay, now there you notice is a
gauche butane within the

00:44:12.836 --> 00:44:14.300
cyclohexane.
 

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.590
And we know how much gauche
butane costs,

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:18.079
compared to anti butane.
 

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:20.070
How much strain is there in
gauche butane?

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.943
Remember gauche versus anti,
I said that was worth

00:44:23.943 --> 00:44:25.050
remembering.
 

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:29.090
It's 0.9 kcal/mol.
 

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.097
Okay, but in fact,
in the whole thing,

00:44:31.097 --> 00:44:34.353
there are six gauche butanes,
because every bond is part of a

00:44:34.353 --> 00:44:37.230
gauche -- is the central bond of
a gauche butane.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:43.264
So if you had six gauche
butanes, that would be a strain

00:44:43.264 --> 00:44:49.349
of six times 0.9;
5.4 kcal/mol. Okay?

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:53.800
And in fact that's rather close
to 6.56.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.250
So that actually is way
over-simplified.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.989
But it's a good mnemonic device
for remembering how big it is.

00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:02.710
It's about six gauche butanes.
 

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:08.530
Or suppose you had axial
methylcyclohexane.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.411
Now you have much,
much worse van der Waals

00:45:11.411 --> 00:45:13.059
interactions -- right?
 

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:17.179
-- 6 and 8 kcal/mol of strain.
 

00:45:17.179 --> 00:45:19.885
But what's going to happen if I
let it relax,

00:45:19.885 --> 00:45:23.699
if I run molecular mechanics
and let it minimize its energy?

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:25.000
Can you guess what's going to
happen?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.059
How will the structure change?
 

00:45:27.059 --> 00:45:30.820
Virginia?
 

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.150
Student:  The last
methyl group.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.869
Prof: Yeah,
that methyl group on the top is

00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:36.480
really in trouble -- right?
 

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.699
-- because of those non-1,4 van
der Waals repulsion.

00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:43.402
But if you bend it back to the
right a little bit,

00:45:43.402 --> 00:45:44.559
you'll reduce that.
 

00:45:44.559 --> 00:45:47.518
So here's what happens,
it relaxes like that.

00:45:47.518 --> 00:45:52.456
And now notice that the non-1,4
van der Waals went from being

00:45:52.456 --> 00:45:55.748
bad, by 6 kcal/mol,
to being good by 1.3,

00:45:55.748 --> 00:45:58.134
overall, summing them all up.
 

00:45:58.134 --> 00:45:59.039
Right?
 

00:45:59.039 --> 00:46:03.077
So it went from sixteen
kilocalories of strain to only

00:46:03.077 --> 00:46:05.670
nine, or from seventeen to nine.
 

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.271
Okay.
 

00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:12.768
And notice that here there are
two more gauche butanes,

00:46:12.768 --> 00:46:16.380
in axial methylcyclohexane.
 

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.920
There were already six in the
cyclohexane ring.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.230
Now there are two more.
 

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:27.085
So you'd guess -- whoops I went
too fast -- you'd guess eight

00:46:27.085 --> 00:46:28.797
times 0.9; 7.2.
 

00:46:28.797 --> 00:46:30.170
It's 8.6.
 

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.179
It's in the right ballpark.
 

00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:35.552
So it's roughly what you'd
expect for eight gauche butanes.

00:46:35.552 --> 00:46:36.079
Okay?
 

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:40.978
Now, if you go from axial to
equatorial, then it turns out

00:46:40.978 --> 00:46:44.590
that energy difference is 1.8
kcal/mole.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.000
Equatorial is 1.8 better than
axial.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.530
Does that surprise you,
that it's 1.8?

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.659
Could you have guessed that it
would be 1.8?

00:46:54.659 --> 00:46:59.023
Notice when it was axial,
there were two gauche butane

00:46:59.023 --> 00:47:00.260
interactions.
 

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.900
When it's equatorial,
those two gauche butanes become

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.239
anti butanes.
 

00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:09.199
And a gauche to anti is 0.9.
 

00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:10.849
There are two of them.
 

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:13.530
So 1.8. Right?
 

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.260
Two gauches become two antis.
 

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.530
So that's axial to equatorial.
 

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.538
And, in fact,
you could put other groups

00:47:19.538 --> 00:47:19.949
there.
 

00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:23.594
Like instead of methyl group,
it could be chlorine or bromine

00:47:23.594 --> 00:47:25.659
or ethyl or something like that.
 

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:29.347
And for any of these,
if you can measure the amount

00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:33.181
of equatorial and axial,
you can get a measure of how

00:47:33.181 --> 00:47:34.507
big that group is.
 

00:47:34.507 --> 00:47:35.320
Right?
 

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.659
So that, these so-called A
values,

00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:40.695
the difference between energy
when it's axial and when it's

00:47:40.695 --> 00:47:44.215
equatorial,
is a nice rough measure of the

00:47:44.215 --> 00:47:46.260
effective group size.
 

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.637
So we'll stop here,
for now, and continue next

00:47:50.637 --> 00:47:51.320
time.

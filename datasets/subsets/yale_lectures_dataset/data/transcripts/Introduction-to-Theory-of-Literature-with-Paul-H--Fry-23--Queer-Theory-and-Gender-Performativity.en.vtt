00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.726
Prof: Now,
I don't think it's ever

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:06.708
happened to me before--
although it might have but I

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:08.620
can't recall its having
happened--

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.743
that I found myself lecturing
on a person who had lectured

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:17.962
yesterday here at Yale,
but that's what happened in

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:18.730
this case.
 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.312
You read--let's just call
it--the facetious article on the

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:25.330
lecture in The Daily News
this morning.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.640
Some of you may actually have
been in attendance.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.168
I unfortunately could not be,
but as it happened I ran into

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:35.817
her later in the evening and
talked to some of her colleagues

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:41.207
about what she'd said,
so I do have a certain sense of

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.900
what went on.
 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.708
In any case,
as to what went on,

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:50.237
I'm going to be talking today
about the slipperiest

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:55.853
intellectual phenomenon in her
essay having to do with what she

00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:58.752
calls "psychic
excess,"

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:03.643
the charge or excess from the
unconscious which in some

00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:09.170
measure unsettles even that
which can be performed.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.688
We perform identity,
we perform our subjectivity,

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:15.903
we perform gender in all the
ways that we'll be discussing in

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.483
this lecture,
but beyond what we can

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:20.745
perform there is
"sexuality,"

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.599
which I'm going to be turning
to in a minute.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.772
This has something to do with
the authentic realm of the

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.159
unconscious from which it
emerges.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.161
What Butler did in her lecture
yesterday was to return to the

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:42.330
psychoanalytic aspect of the
essay that you read for today,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.879
emphasizing particularly the
work of Lacan's disciple,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:51.565
Jean Laplanche,
and developing the ways in

00:01:51.565 --> 00:01:58.421
which sexuality is something
that belongs in a dimension that

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:05.277
exceeds and is less accessible
than those more coded concepts

00:02:05.277 --> 00:02:12.020
that we think of as gender or as
identity in general.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.977
So conveniently enough,
for those of you who did attend

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:19.610
her lecture yesterday,
in many ways she really did

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.276
return to the issues that
concerned her at the period of

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.943
her career when she wrote
Gender Trouble and when

00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:30.408
she wrote the essay that you've
read for today.

00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:31.186
All right.
 

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:35.458
Now I do want to begin with
what ought to be an innocent

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:36.389
question.
 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.705
Surely we're entitled to an
answer to this question,

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.370
and the question is:
what is sexuality?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.598
Now of course you may be given
pause--

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.098
especially if you've got an ear
fine-tuned to jargon--

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:51.462
you may be given pause by the
very word

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.140
"sexuality,"
which is obviously relatively

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.560
recent in the language.
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.830
People didn't used to talk
about sexuality.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.811
They talked about sex,
which seems somehow more

00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:04.335
straightforward,
but "sexuality"

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:09.834
is a term which is not only
pervasive in cultural thought

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:15.923
but also has a certain privilege
among other ways of describing

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:18.870
that aspect of our lives.
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.520
In other words,
there is something authentic,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.280
as I've already begun to
suggest, about our sexuality,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.014
something more authentic about
that than the sorts of aspects

00:03:31.014 --> 00:03:34.330
of ourselves that we can and do
perform.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.508
That's Butler's argument,
and it's an interesting

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.387
starting point,
but it's not yet,

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:44.616
or perhaps not at all,
an answer to the question,

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:46.818
"What is sexuality?"
 

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:52.932
Now for Foucault sexuality is
arguably something like desired

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:59.364
and experienced bodily pleasure,
but the problem in Foucault is

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:05.093
that this pleasure is always
orchestrated by a set of factors

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:09.645
that surround it,
a very complicated set of

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:15.752
factors which is articulated
perhaps best on page 1634 in his

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:18.899
text,
the lower right-hand column.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.451
He's talking about the
difference between and the

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:26.593
interaction between what he
calls the "deployment of

00:04:26.593 --> 00:04:29.406
alliance"
and the "deployment

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:32.940
of"--
our word--"sexuality."

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.949
I want to read this passage and
then comment on it briefly:

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.440
"In a word [and it's of
course not in a word;

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.536
it's in several words],
the deployment of alliance is

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.790
attuned to a homeostasis of the
social body..."

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.600
The deployment of alliance is
the way in which,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.267
in a given culture,
the nuclear reproductive unit

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:00.745
is defined,
typically as the

00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:03.747
"family,"
but the family in itself

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:06.750
changes in its nature and its
structure.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.569
The way in which the family is
viewed,

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.901
the sorts of activities that
are supposed to take place and

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:16.899
not take place in the family--
because Foucault lays a certain

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.733
amount of stress on incest and
the atmospheric threat of

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.369
incest--
the sorts of things that go on

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:30.204
in the family and are surrounded
by certain kinds of discourse

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:34.173
conveying knowledge--
and we'll come back to the

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:38.072
latter part of that sentence--
all have to do with the

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:40.060
deployment of alliance.
 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.887
On the other hand,
the deployment of sexuality we

00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:50.622
understand as the way in which
whatever this thing is that

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:55.050
we're trying to define is talked
about--

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.000
and therefore not by any state
apparatus or actual legal system

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.867
necessarily--
but nevertheless simply by the

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:12.610
prevalence and force of various
sorts of knowledge police.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.769
Okay.
 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:17.180
To continue the passage:
In a word, the deployment of

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.007
alliance is attuned to a
homeostasis [or a

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:22.860
regularization;
that's what he means by

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.870
"homeostasis"]
of the social body,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.949
which it has the function of
maintaining;

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.850
whence its privileged link with
the law [that is to say,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.370
the law tells us all sorts of
things about the family--

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.990
including whether or not there
can be gay marriage,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.230
just incidentally:
I'll come back to that in a

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.067
minute];
whence too the fact that the

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:49.000
important phase for it is
"reproduction."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.240
The deployment of sexuality has
its reason for being,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.089
not in reproducing itself,
but in proliferating,

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:59.550
innovating, annexing,
creating, and penetrating

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.709
bodies in an increasingly
detailed way,

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:08.380
and in controlling populations
in an increasingly comprehensive

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.930
way.
 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.740
What he's saying is,
among other things,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.791
that a deployment of sexuality,
which isn't necessarily a bad

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:19.461
thing--
these deployments aren't meant

00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.689
somehow or another to be
terroristic regimes--

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:27.295
a deployment of sexuality,
which for example favored forms

00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:31.740
of sexuality such as birth
control or homosexuality,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.699
would certainly be a means of
controlling reproduction.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.822
Just in that degree,
the deployment of sexuality

00:07:40.822 --> 00:07:45.733
could be seen as subtly or not
so subtly at odds with the

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:50.874
deployment of alliance,
alliance which is all for the

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:56.800
purpose of reproduction or at
least takes as its primary sign,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.000
as Foucault suggests,
the importance,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.170
the centrality,
to a given culture--

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.089
or sociobiological system,
if you wil--

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.420
of reproduction.
 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.723
These are the ways in which the
deployment of alliance and the

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:13.322
deployment of sexuality
converge, don't converge,

00:08:13.322 --> 00:08:15.110
and conflict with each other.
 

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.257
But in all of these ways,
we keep seeing this concept of

00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:22.410
sexuality;
but, as I say,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.680
it continues to be somewhat
elusive what precisely it is.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.533
Just to bracket that for the
moment, let me make another

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:34.808
comment or two on the concepts
in the passage that I have just

00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:35.440
read.
 

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.452
Let's say once and for all at
the outset that the central idea

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:43.799
in Foucault's text,
the idea which he continues to

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.520
develop throughout the three
volumes on the history of

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.998
sexuality--
the central idea is this idea

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:54.565
of "power"
as something other than that

00:08:54.565 --> 00:09:00.412
which is enforced through legal,
policing or state apparatus

00:09:00.412 --> 00:09:01.038
means.
 

00:09:01.038 --> 00:09:07.251
This is power which is enforced
as a circulation or distribution

00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:12.042
of knowledge,
which is discursive in nature,

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:16.860
and which enforces its norms
for all of us,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.597
for better or for
worse--because discourse can

00:09:20.597 --> 00:09:24.625
release and can constitute sites
of resistance as well as

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.898
oppress--
which, for better or worse,

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:33.269
circulates among us ideas that
are in a certain sense governing

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.600
ideas about whatever it is
that's in question,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.350
in this case,
obviously, sexuality.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.268
Foucault calls this,
sometimes hyphenating it,

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:46.879
"power-knowledge."
 

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:51.668
This is absolutely the central
idea in late Foucault.

00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:53.580
I introduced it,
you remember,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.820
last time in talking about
Said.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.908
I come back to it now as that
which really governs--

00:09:59.908 --> 00:10:03.913
and guides you through--the
whole text of Foucault:

00:10:03.913 --> 00:10:08.798
the distinction between power
as it's traditionally understood

00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:12.450
as authoritative--
as sort of top- down,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.878
coming from above,
imposed on us by law,

00:10:15.878 --> 00:10:18.717
by the police,
by whatever establishment of

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:22.562
that kind there might be--
the distinction between power

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:26.847
of that kind and power which is
simply the way in which

00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:29.394
knowledge--
and knowledge is not,

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:31.990
by the way, necessarily a good
word,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.538
it's not necessarily knowledge
of the truth--

00:10:34.538 --> 00:10:41.013
the way in which knowledge
circulates and imposes its

00:10:41.013 --> 00:10:44.173
effects on us,
our behavior,

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:48.830
the way we are or the way at
least that we think we are--

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.317
the way in which we
"perform,"

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.529
in Butler's term.
 

00:10:52.529 --> 00:11:00.610
All of that in Foucault is to
be understood as an effect of

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.120
power-knowledge.
 

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.075
Now notice, however,
in terms of our question--What

00:11:07.075 --> 00:11:11.028
is sexuality?--that Foucault is
being quite coy.

00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:14.820
He's talking about sexuality
but he's not talking about it in

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.966
itself,
whatever it "in

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:18.610
itself" might be.
 

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.519
He's talking about the
deployment of it,

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:27.100
that is to say the way in which
power-knowledge constructs it,

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.009
makes it visible,
makes it available to us,

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:34.749
and makes it a channel through
which desire can get itself

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:38.196
expressed,
but a channel which is still

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:43.520
not necessarily in and of itself
that natural thing that we look

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.100
for and long for and continue to
seek: the nature of sexuality.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.438
So when the emphasis in
Foucault's discussion is really

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:58.147
on deployment,
that is, the way in which

00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:00.730
alliance--
the family, whatever the

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.269
nuclear social structure might
be--

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:08.951
or sexuality--whatever it is
that gets itself expressed as

00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.255
desire--
the way in which these matters,

00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:17.519
these aspects of our lives,
can be deployed,

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:21.398
we still aren't necessarily
talking about the thing in

00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:22.129
itself.
 

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:23.870
Foucault isn't an
anthropologist.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.740
He's not talking about the
family in itself either.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.714
He's talking about the way in
which a basic concept of

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:36.312
alliance out of which
reproduction arises and gets

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:39.879
itself channeled can be
deployed,

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:44.691
and understood as manipulated
by, the circulation of

00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:46.389
power-knowledge.
 

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:50.110
The issue of gay marriage is
very interestingly,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.817
by the way, between the
concepts of the deployment of

00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:58.330
alliance and the deployment of
sexuality,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.849
because there's a certain sense
in which the deployment of

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:07.210
sexuality is at odds with the
deployment of alliance.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.923
If sexuality is something that
is really just looking around

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.190
for ways to get itself
expressed,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.706
taking advantage of deployment
where that's a good thing and

00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:19.865
trying to resist deployment
where that seems more like

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:22.205
policing--
if it's just looking around for

00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:24.562
a way to get expressed,
it's not particularly

00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:25.870
interested in alliance.
 

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:31.864
It's not interested in the way
in which relationships involving

00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:37.375
sexuality could settle into any
kind of a coded pattern or

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:42.640
system of regularity,
so that there is this tension

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.082
which,
of course, gets itself

00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:48.654
expressed whenever,
within the gay community,

00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:52.976
people strongly support gay
marriage and see that as the

00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:56.668
politicized center of
contemporary gay life;

00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:59.730
or people also in
the gay community,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.678
many of them theoretically
advanced,

00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:07.239
think of it as a non-issue or a
side issue which loses track

00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:13.269
precisely of what Foucault calls
the deployment of sexuality,

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.379
simply trying to extend the
domain,

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:21.850
arguably a tyrannical domain,
of the deployment of alliance--

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.586
in other words,
to redefine the basic concept

00:14:25.586 --> 00:14:30.258
of alliance in such a way that
doesn't really touch very

00:14:30.258 --> 00:14:33.908
closely on the deployment of
sexuality.

00:14:33.908 --> 00:14:38.037
So it's an interesting and
rather mixed set of issues that

00:14:38.037 --> 00:14:41.111
the whole question,
the whole sort of profoundly

00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:44.529
politicized question,
of gay marriage gives rise to.

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:51.759
So that's what sexuality is
&gt;

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.440
in Foucault.
 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.075
In Butler it's just clearer
that to ask the question--What

00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:02.710
is sexuality?-- is--well,
it's just been a false start.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.734
We thought it was an innocent
question, but you get into

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:13.397
Butler and you see very clearly
that you simply can't be

00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:15.590
a certain sexuality.
 

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.791
You can perform an identity,
as we'll see,

00:15:20.791 --> 00:15:24.090
by repeating,
by imitating,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.769
and by parodying in drag.
 

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:32.644
You can perform an identity,
but you can't wholly

00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:37.342
perform sexuality precisely
because of this element of

00:15:37.342 --> 00:15:42.573
psychic excess to which her
thinking continues very candidly

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:46.120
and openly and honestly to
return.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.850
Butler's work,
in other words,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.490
is not just about "the
construction of identity."

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.524
It's not just about the domain
of performance,

00:15:55.524 --> 00:15:57.230
as one might say.
 

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.538
It acknowledges that there is
something very difficult to

00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:04.769
grasp and articulate beyond
performance.

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:09.390
Its main business is to explain
the nature and purview and

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.764
purposes of performance,
but it's nevertheless always

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:17.399
clear in Butler,
as she returns to the question

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:20.000
of the unconscious in
particular,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.620
that there is something in
excess of,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:30.639
or not fully to be encompassed
by, ideas of performance.

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:33.960
So we've made a false start.
 

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.918
We've asked a question we can't
answer, but at the same time we

00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:41.320
have learned certain things.
 

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.558
We've learned certainly that
sexuality,

00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:47.736
whatever it is,
is more flexible and also in

00:16:47.736 --> 00:16:51.035
some sense more authentic--
that is to say,

00:16:51.035 --> 00:16:54.428
closest to the actual nature of
the drives.

00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:58.466
Yesterday Butler made a
distinction between instinct and

00:16:58.466 --> 00:17:02.577
drive which I won't go into
because it had to do with her

00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:06.982
reflections on what is cultural
and what is biological or not

00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:10.358
cultural in the life of the
unconscious.

00:17:10.358 --> 00:17:14.635
For our purposes,
whatever role sexuality may

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:20.160
play in the unconscious,
and however authentic--that is

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.157
to say,
however not culturally

00:17:23.157 --> 00:17:26.240
determined that role may turn
out to be--

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.278
it's more flexible.
 

00:17:28.278 --> 00:17:31.612
That's the important thing,
more than any kind of social

00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:34.491
coding: the sort of coding,
for example,

00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:40.073
that Foucault would indicate in
speaking of alliance or deployed

00:17:40.073 --> 00:17:45.741
sexuality and the sort of coding
that Butler refers to repeatedly

00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:48.400
as "gendering."
 

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.847
Still, for both of them--and
this is the other thing we've

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:57.232
learned--
even sexuality through

00:17:57.232 --> 00:18:03.807
deployment, or through the way
in which it can get expressed in

00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:09.430
relation to gender and
performance, is discursive.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.750
It's a matter of discourse.
 

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.130
It arises out of linguistic
formations,

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.885
formations that Foucault
understands as circulated

00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:22.029
knowledge and that Butler
understands,

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:24.150
again, as performance.
 

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:30.208
Foucault sees sexuality as the
effect of power-knowledge,

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.480
power as knowledge.
 

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.181
Butler sees it as the
effect--insofar as it's visible,

00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:43.667
insofar as it is acted
out--sees it as the effect of

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.390
performance.
 

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:51.017
So now to take the way in which
Butler makes this relationship

00:18:51.017 --> 00:18:55.630
between what one might suppose
to be authentic,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.920
actual, all about one's self,
and that which is performed,

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.798
that which is one's constructs
toward being a self,

00:19:05.798 --> 00:19:10.334
let's take one of the most
provocative sentences in her

00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:13.369
essay,
which is on page 1711 about a

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:17.380
third of the way down:
"Since I was sixteen,

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:25.730
being a lesbian is what I've
been."

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.347
Now what she's doing--remember
at the very beginning of the

00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:32.779
essay she says that her whole
purpose is to reflect,

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:37.615
is somehow or another to
register a politicized

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:43.606
intervention in gender studies
in terms of a philosophical

00:19:43.606 --> 00:19:46.401
reflection--
on ontology,

00:19:46.401 --> 00:19:48.440
on "being."
 

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.400
What is it in other words,
she says, to be

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.390
something?
 

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.000
Now what she's doing in this
sentence,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.180
which is an awkward-seeming
sentence,

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.030
"[B]eing a lesbian is what
I've been,"

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:10.121
is pointing out to us that to
be something is very different

00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:14.559
from to be "being"
something.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:18.619
For example, I can say I'm busy.
 

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:20.519
(By the way, I am.)
 

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:26.476
I can say I'm busy and I expect
you to take it that there's a

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:31.240
certain integrity,
there's a certain authenticity

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.220
in the fact that I'm busy.
 

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.773
Yes, I'm busy,
but suppose you say,

00:20:37.773 --> 00:20:42.479
suspecting that I'm not really
busy, "Oh,

00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:45.930
he's being busy."
 

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.848
In other words,
he's performing busy-ness.

00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:56.150
He's going around being busy,
sort of imposing on me the idea

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.212
that this lazy person is
actually accomplishing

00:21:00.212 --> 00:21:01.450
something.
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.480
So, the performance of being
busy.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.885
But here's the interesting
point that Butler is making:

00:21:08.885 --> 00:21:13.375
the ontological realm is
supposed to be about the simple

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:18.705
being or existence of things,
and it's always in philosophy

00:21:18.705 --> 00:21:22.787
contrasted with agency,
with the doing of things,

00:21:22.787 --> 00:21:27.019
with getting something done,
with the performance of things.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:30.369
But what Butler is saying--and
that's why she says that she

00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:33.201
takes an interest in the
ontological aspect of the

00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:36.265
question--
what she's saying is that there

00:21:36.265 --> 00:21:39.683
is an element of the
performative which actually

00:21:39.683 --> 00:21:41.940
creeps into the ontological.
 

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.287
Even being, she says,
is something that in some

00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:52.051
measure--perhaps not altogether
but in some measure--something

00:21:52.051 --> 00:21:53.470
we perform.
 

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.709
Hence the doubling up of the
word "being"

00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:02.078
in the sentence,
"Since I was sixteen,

00:22:02.078 --> 00:22:05.278
being a lesbian is what I've
been."

00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:08.564
In one sense,
yeah, I am--that's what I am,

00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:12.240
but in another sense I've been
performing it.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.660
I've been being one.
 

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.848
&gt;
 

00:22:15.848 --> 00:22:18.759
I've been outing myself,
if you will.

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:23.394
I have been taking up a role
that can be understood,

00:22:23.394 --> 00:22:27.484
as all roles can,
intelligibly in terms of its

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:28.940
performance.
 

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.348
So that's why she puts the
sentence that way,

00:22:32.348 --> 00:22:36.146
and if you made a big mark in
the margin and said,

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.930
"Aha, got her!
 

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.980
This is where she says she
really is something.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.644
No more of this stuff about
just constructivism,

00:22:44.644 --> 00:22:47.608
making oneself up as one goes
along.

00:22:47.608 --> 00:22:49.268
This is where she says she
really is

00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:50.730
something,"
then you're wrong.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:51.720
&gt;
 

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.134
She's escaped your criticism
because she says,

00:22:54.134 --> 00:22:55.368
"Oh, no,
no, no.

00:22:55.368 --> 00:23:00.538
I have been being a lesbian:
I've been being one,

00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:03.278
which is a different thing,
although not altogether a

00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:06.028
different thing,
from being one."

00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:08.078
She is deliberately,
in other words,

00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:13.596
on the fence between the sense
of the ontological as authentic

00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:18.932
and her own innovative sense of
the ontological as belonging

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:22.190
within the realm of performance.
 

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.858
She doesn't want to get off the
fence.

00:23:24.858 --> 00:23:30.563
She really doesn't want to come
down squarely on either side

00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:33.798
because for her--
and this is what I like best

00:23:33.798 --> 00:23:35.782
about her work,
even though it's perhaps the

00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:37.160
most frustrating thing about
it--

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.944
because for her,
what she is talking about is

00:23:40.944 --> 00:23:43.009
ultimately mysterious.
 

00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:45.680
She has a great deal to say
about it,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.950
but she's not pretending that
in what she has to say about it

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.240
she's exhausted the
"subject."

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.075
That's why it seems to me to be
admirable that she stays on the

00:23:56.075 --> 00:23:59.740
fence about this,
and not simply an occasion for

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.299
our frustration.
 

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:17.680
So with all of this said--and
mystification aside,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.848
if you will,
as well--with all of this said,

00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:24.656
it seems plain that Foucault
and Butler do have a common

00:24:24.656 --> 00:24:26.930
political agenda.
 

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.861
Foucault is a gay writer who
was, in the later stages of

00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:36.792
writing The History of
Sexuality, dying of

00:24:36.792 --> 00:24:40.098
AIDS;
Butler is a lesbian writer.

00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:44.105
Both of them are very much
concerned for the political

00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:47.960
implications of their
marginalized gender roles,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.821
while at the same time--of
course, being theoretically very

00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:53.618
sophisticated about them.
 

00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:58.788
Their common political agenda
is to destabilize the

00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:03.750
hetero-normative by denying the
authenticity,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.355
or in Butler's parlance
"originality,"

00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:09.578
of privileged gender roles.
 

00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:13.759
In other words,
who says heterosexuality came

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:14.519
first?
 

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:18.798
Who says the nuclear family is
natural?

00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:24.544
Who says sexuality can only get
itself expressed in certain ways

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:28.009
that power-knowledge deploys for
it?

00:25:28.009 --> 00:25:32.709
These are the sorts of
questions, the politicized

00:25:32.709 --> 00:25:37.798
questions, which these
discourses raise in common.

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:43.153
So it seems to me that they
have a very broad agenda in

00:25:43.153 --> 00:25:49.102
common, and it also seems to me
that they are very closely in

00:25:49.102 --> 00:25:50.490
agreement.
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.378
I say that just in order to
pause briefly on the moment in

00:25:54.378 --> 00:25:56.288
which they seem not to be.
 

00:25:56.288 --> 00:26:01.538
You've probably noticed that
one text is referring to another

00:26:01.538 --> 00:26:06.001
at one point in your reading,
and so let's go there:

00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:09.240
page 1712, the right-hand
margin.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.584
The context for this,
of course, is Butler talking

00:26:13.584 --> 00:26:18.372
about Jesse Helms having
deplored male homosexuality in

00:26:18.372 --> 00:26:23.160
attacking the photography of
Robert Mapplethorpe,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.242
and by implication,
Butler argues,

00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:30.541
simply erasing female
homosexuality because his

00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:34.000
diatribe pays no attention to
it.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.441
Butler then complains that
there's a certain injustice in

00:26:38.441 --> 00:26:41.438
that because,
in a way, it's even worse,

00:26:41.438 --> 00:26:43.891
she says,
sort of to be declared

00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:47.568
nonexistent than it is to be
declared deviant.

00:26:47.568 --> 00:26:51.073
At least the male homosexual
gets to be declared deviant:

00:26:51.073 --> 00:26:52.450
we're simply erased.
 

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.002
That's the position she's
taking here, and then at that

00:26:57.002 --> 00:27:01.347
point, what she says is:
To be prohibited explicitly is

00:27:01.347 --> 00:27:05.070
to occupy a discursive site from
which something like a

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.828
reverse-discourse can be
articulated;

00:27:07.828 --> 00:27:12.836
to be implicitly proscribed is
not even to qualify as an object

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:14.210
of prohibition.
 

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.544
Here's where she gives us a
footnote on Foucault,

00:27:18.544 --> 00:27:22.970
footnote fifteen (you know we
love footnotes):

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:28.079
It is this particular ruse of
erasure which Foucault for the

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:33.450
most part fails to take account
of in his analysis of power.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.243
Butler's argument is that in
Foucauldian terms,

00:27:36.243 --> 00:27:39.220
there's got to be
discourse for there to be

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.009
identity.
 

00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:43.733
Helms's refusal of the category
of "lesbian"

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:46.314
simply by omission--
and of course,

00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:49.300
we know, by the way,
that this is a refusal

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.998
only by omission--
Helms's refusal of this

00:27:52.998 --> 00:27:55.521
category is,
in other words,

00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:57.609
an erasure of discourse.
 

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:59.660
No discourse, no identity.
 

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.846
That is, in other words,
what Butler is claiming

00:28:03.846 --> 00:28:06.519
Foucault's position entails.
 

00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:08.608
Discourse creates
power-knowledge.

00:28:08.608 --> 00:28:11.088
Power-knowledge creates
identity.

00:28:11.088 --> 00:28:13.368
Therefore, where there's no
discourse,

00:28:13.368 --> 00:28:17.445
there can be no identity,
and since Helms has erased the

00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:20.558
lesbian by refusing discourse
about it,

00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:24.078
it must follow that there is no
such thing as a lesbian.

00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:28.838
That's the implication of this
footnote.

00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:33.765
He almost always presumes [and
we must do honor to that word

00:28:33.765 --> 00:28:37.855
"almost"]
that power takes place through

00:28:37.855 --> 00:28:43.619
discourse as its instrument,
and that oppression is linked

00:28:43.619 --> 00:28:47.670
with subjection and
subjectivization,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.719
that is, that it is installed
as the formative principle of

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:55.068
the identity of subjects.
 

00:28:55.068 --> 00:29:00.768
Now in defense of Foucault,
let's go to page 1632,

00:29:00.768 --> 00:29:07.628
the upper right-hand column,
a passage that's fascinating on

00:29:07.628 --> 00:29:10.420
a number of grounds.
 

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.517
It's rather long but I think I
will read it,

00:29:13.517 --> 00:29:15.390
upper right-hand column.
 

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.317
Foucault says:
Consider for example the

00:29:18.317 --> 00:29:20.653
history of what was once
"the"

00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:22.328
great sin against nature.
 

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:26.410
The extreme discretion of the
texts dealing with sodomy--

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.875
that utterly confused
category--and the nearly

00:29:29.875 --> 00:29:34.651
universal reticence in talking
about it made possible a twofold

00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:35.730
operation.
 

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.500
Okay.
 

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.308
Here's Foucault saying that
this is a category.

00:29:41.308 --> 00:29:45.746
The homosexual identity,
as understood in terms of

00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:47.920
sodomy, is a category.
 

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.440
He's going to go on to say that
it's punishable in the extreme

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.108
by law, but in the meantime he's
saying there's no discourse.

00:29:57.108 --> 00:30:00.394
There's a kind of almost
universal silence on the

00:30:00.394 --> 00:30:01.078
subject.
 

00:30:01.078 --> 00:30:04.704
You don't get silence in Dante,
as I'm sure you know,

00:30:04.704 --> 00:30:08.680
but in most cases in this
period nobody talks about it.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.539
It's punishable,
severely punishable by law,

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:13.670
and yet nobody talks about it.
 

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.046
This would seem to
violate Foucault's own premise

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:22.105
that discourse constitutes
identity but also plainly

00:30:22.105 --> 00:30:26.799
does contradict Butler's
claim that Foucault supposes

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:30.700
that discourse always
constitutes identity.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.209
Let's continue:
… [T]he nearly universal

00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:38.160
reticence in talking about it
made possible a twofold

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.617
operation: on the one hand,
there was an extreme severity

00:30:41.617 --> 00:30:44.957
(punishment by fire was meted
out well into the eighteenth

00:30:44.957 --> 00:30:46.969
century,
without there being any

00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:49.984
substantial protest expressed
before the middle of the

00:30:49.984 --> 00:30:53.173
century) [Discourse is here
failing also in that it's not

00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:55.450
constituting a site of
resistance,

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.170
and nobody's complaining about
these severe punishments just as

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.470
on the other hand nobody's
talking very much about them:

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.405
there is,
in other words,

00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:08.638
an erasure of discourse],
and [he continues]

00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:13.506
on the other hand,
a tolerance that must have been

00:31:13.506 --> 00:31:18.294
widespread (which one can deduce
indirectly from the infrequency

00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:21.902
of judicial sentences,
and which one glimpses more

00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:25.228
directly through certain
statements concerning societies

00:31:25.228 --> 00:31:28.492
of men that were thought to
exist in the army or in the

00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:30.762
courts)--
In other words,

00:31:30.762 --> 00:31:36.554
he's saying there was an
identity and that identity was

00:31:36.554 --> 00:31:42.058
not--at least not very much--
constituted by discourse.

00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:45.993
As you read down the column,
he's going to go on to say that

00:31:45.993 --> 00:31:49.662
in a way, the plight of the
homosexual got worse when it

00:31:49.662 --> 00:31:51.730
started being talked about.
 

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.660
Yes, penalties for being
homosexual were less severe,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.630
but the surveillance of
homosexuality--

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:04.442
the way in which it could be
sort of dictated to by therapy

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:08.757
and by the clergy and by
everyone else who might have

00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:13.145
something to say about it--
became far more pervasive and

00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:17.028
determinate than it was when
there was no discourse about it.

00:32:17.028 --> 00:32:21.919
In a certain way,
Foucault is going so far as to

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:26.288
say silence was,
while perilous to the few,

00:32:26.288 --> 00:32:32.471
a good thing for the many;
whereas discourse which perhaps

00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:38.595
relieves the few of extreme fear
nevertheless sort of imposes a

00:32:38.595 --> 00:32:44.619
kind of hegemonic authority on
all that remain and constitutes

00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:49.952
them as something that
power-knowledge believes them to

00:32:49.952 --> 00:32:53.289
be,
rather than something that in

00:32:53.289 --> 00:32:57.635
any sense according to their
sexuality they spontaneously

00:32:57.635 --> 00:32:58.180
are.
 

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.319
It seems to me that this
pointed disagreement with

00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:03.377
Foucault,
raised by Butler,

00:33:03.377 --> 00:33:07.700
is answered in advance by
Foucault and that even there,

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.734
when you think about it,
they're really in agreement

00:33:11.734 --> 00:33:13.160
with each other.
 

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.819
Foucault's position is more
flexible than she takes it to

00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:20.516
be,
but that just means that it's

00:33:20.516 --> 00:33:24.875
similar to her own and,
as I say, that fact together

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:30.248
with the broad shared political
agenda that they have seems to

00:33:30.248 --> 00:33:35.356
me to suggest that they're
writing very much in concert and

00:33:35.356 --> 00:33:38.880
in keeping with each other's
views.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.348
Now in method they are somewhat
different.

00:33:42.348 --> 00:33:47.840
Foucault is a more historical
writer, although historians

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.450
often criticize him for not
being historical.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.570
The reason historians don't
think he's historical is that he

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.692
never really explains how you
get from one moment in history

00:34:00.692 --> 00:34:01.808
to the next.
 

00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:05.743
He talks about moments in
history, but he talks about them

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:08.159
in terms of bodies of
knowledge--

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.268
"epistemic moments,"
as he sometimes says.

00:34:11.268 --> 00:34:14.833
Then these moments somehow
mysteriously become other

00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:16.929
moments and are transformed.
 

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:21.081
The kind of causality that
might explain such a thing from

00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:25.454
an historian's point of view
tends in Foucault's arguments to

00:34:25.454 --> 00:34:26.619
be left out.
 

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:29.210
He nevertheless is concerned,
however,

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.489
with the way in which views of
things change over time,

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:37.235
and it's the change in those
views that his argument in

00:34:37.235 --> 00:34:41.260
The History of Sexuality
tends to concentrate on;

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.581
so that he can say that
starting in the nineteenth

00:34:44.581 --> 00:34:47.360
century and continuing to the
present,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.585
there are essentially four
cathected beings around which

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:57.320
power-knowledge deploys itself.
 

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.409
He describes them as the
hysterical woman,

00:35:01.409 --> 00:35:05.409
the masturbating child,
the Malthusian couple--

00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:08.585
meaning the couple that is
enjoined not to reproduce too

00:35:08.585 --> 00:35:11.300
much because the economy won't
stand for it,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.592
which is a way of,
you see, of deploying alliance

00:35:15.592 --> 00:35:20.780
in such a way as to manipulate
and control reproduction.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.063
That's a moment,
by the way, in which the

00:35:23.063 --> 00:35:26.489
deployment of alliance and the
deployment of sexuality may be

00:35:26.489 --> 00:35:30.387
in league with each other,
because obviously birth control

00:35:30.387 --> 00:35:34.230
and homosexual practices can
also control reproduction.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.898
As you see, it's not always a
question of conflict between

00:35:38.898 --> 00:35:41.518
these two forms of deployment.
 

00:35:41.518 --> 00:35:44.137
So in any case,
there's the Malthusian couple

00:35:44.137 --> 00:35:47.409
and then the perverse adult,
meaning the queer person in

00:35:47.409 --> 00:35:48.480
whatever form.
 

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.050
He says about this--on page
1634 in the left-hand column--

00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:01.159
that you get these four types,
and he says that therapy,

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:07.300
the clergy, family,
parental advice,

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.217
and the various ways in which
knowledge of this kind

00:36:11.217 --> 00:36:16.059
circulates have to do primarily
with the preoccupation with,

00:36:16.059 --> 00:36:19.119
tension about,
anxiety about these four types.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:23.592
The hysterical woman is
determined to be hysterical once

00:36:23.592 --> 00:36:28.800
it begins to be thought that her
whole being is her sexuality.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.972
The masturbating child violates
the idea that children are born

00:36:35.972 --> 00:36:40.934
innocent and must be--
because it suggests something

00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:45.608
terribly wrong about the cult of
the innocent child that begins

00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:49.800
in the nineteenth century--
it's something that is subject

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.119
to extreme and severe
surveillance.

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:54.260
"Who knows what will come
of this?"

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.271
Scientific thinking about
masturbation had to do with the

00:36:58.271 --> 00:37:03.802
notion that it led to impotence,
that by the time you got around

00:37:03.802 --> 00:37:08.144
to being in a relationship,
there wouldn't be anything

00:37:08.144 --> 00:37:09.018
there anymore.
 

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:13.070
Just terrible thoughts--also it
stunted your growth and you died

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.961
sooner--just terrible,
terrible thoughts about

00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:17.570
masturbation existed.
 

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.699
All of this dominated the
scientific literature until well

00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:23.800
into the twentieth century.
 

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.300
Then the Malthusian couple,
which was primarily a

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.382
phenomenon of what's called
"political economy"

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:35.539
in the earlier nineteenth
century but has prevailed,

00:37:35.539 --> 00:37:39.250
by the way, in what we suppose
to be,

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.824
and indeed what is,
our progressive technology of

00:37:42.824 --> 00:37:46.550
the promotion of birth control
around the world.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.307
"We must control
population"

00:37:49.307 --> 00:37:53.259
is still the Malthusian
principle on which we base the

00:37:53.259 --> 00:37:57.360
idea that people really need to
be enlightened about the

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.429
possibility of not just having
an infinite number of children.

00:38:02.429 --> 00:38:07.686
Again you see that Foucault is
right still to suppose that the

00:38:07.686 --> 00:38:12.170
notion of the Malthusian couple
prevails among us.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:16.648
Then finally the perverse
adult, who is first discoursed

00:38:16.648 --> 00:38:21.018
about in the nineteenth century,
as the earlier passage that I

00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:22.947
read suggested,
and is still,

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:25.820
of course, widely discoursed
about.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.690
Of course it now has a voice
and discourses in its own right:

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:36.465
a literature,
a journalism and all the rest

00:38:36.465 --> 00:38:39.945
of it,
and is in other words very much

00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:43.932
in the mainstream of discourse
and still has controversy

00:38:43.932 --> 00:38:47.523
swirling around it,
precisely because of the

00:38:47.523 --> 00:38:50.809
discursive formations that
attach to it.

00:38:50.809 --> 00:38:55.012
All of this Foucault takes to
be in the nature of historical

00:38:55.012 --> 00:38:56.010
observation.
 

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.949
For Butler on the other hand,
as you can tell from her

00:38:59.949 --> 00:39:01.451
style--
I am sure that,

00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:03.389
as in the case of reading
Bhabha,

00:39:03.389 --> 00:39:07.139
you recognize a lot of Derrida
in Butler's style--

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:11.327
in Butler it's a question of
taking these same issues and

00:39:11.327 --> 00:39:15.289
orienting them more in the
direction of philosophy.

00:39:15.289 --> 00:39:19.001
I've already suggested the way
in which she understands this

00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:22.210
particular essay as a
contribution to that branch of

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.601
philosophy called
"ontology,"

00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:26.489
the philosophy of being.
 

00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:30.907
In general she takes a
particular and acute interest in

00:39:30.907 --> 00:39:31.480
that.
 

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.393
Her basic move is something
that I hope by this time you've

00:39:36.393 --> 00:39:40.628
become familiar with and
recognize and perhaps even

00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:41.900
anticipate.
 

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.530
For us, perhaps,
the inaugural moves of this

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.994
kind were the various
distinctions made by

00:39:48.994 --> 00:39:50.429
Levi-Strauss.
 

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:52.980
The one that I mentioned in
particular--

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.798
as accessible and I think
immediately explanatory of how

00:39:56.798 --> 00:39:58.938
the move works--
is "the raw"

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.070
and "the cooked."
 

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.956
I tried to show that
intuitively, obviously,

00:40:03.956 --> 00:40:06.670
the raw precedes the cooked.
 

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.719
First it's raw,
then it's cooked,

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:12.373
and yet at the same time if we
understand the relationship

00:40:12.373 --> 00:40:16.539
between the raw and the cooked
to be a discursive formation,

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:20.139
we have to recognize that there
would be no such thing as the

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:22.179
raw if there weren't the cooked.
 

00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:26.836
If you talk about eating a raw
carrot, you have to have had a

00:40:26.836 --> 00:40:28.079
cooked carrot.
 

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:32.041
You don't just pick up a
carrot, which you've never seen

00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:35.139
before, and say,
"This is raw."

00:40:35.139 --> 00:40:38.893
The only way you know it's raw
is to know that it can be and

00:40:38.893 --> 00:40:40.039
has been cooked.
 

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:44.081
Well, this is the Butler move,
the move that she makes again

00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:45.590
and again and again.
 

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:49.628
What do you mean,
the heterosexual precedes the

00:40:49.628 --> 00:40:50.768
homosexual?
 

00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:54.219
What do you mean,
the heterosexual is an original

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:57.239
and the homosexual is just a
copy of it?

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:03.820
Who would ever think of the
concept of the heterosexual?

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.710
You're the only person on earth.
 

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.050
You stand there and you say,
"I'm heterosexual."

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.340
&gt;
 

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.460
You don't do that.
 

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.394
You just say,
"Well, I have

00:41:14.394 --> 00:41:15.519
sexuality."
 

00:41:15.519 --> 00:41:16.760
You could say that.
 

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.300
If you had enough jargon at
your disposal,

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.592
you could say that,
but you can't say,

00:41:21.592 --> 00:41:23.699
"I am heterosexual."
 

00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:27.025
You can't have the concept
heterosexual without having the

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:28.250
concept homosexual.
 

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:34.150
They are absolutely mutually
dependent, and it has nothing to

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:39.954
do with any possible truth of a
chicken and egg nature as to

00:41:39.954 --> 00:41:42.018
which came first.
 

00:41:42.018 --> 00:41:45.099
In sexuality,
the very strong supposition is

00:41:45.099 --> 00:41:47.750
for Butler that neither came
first.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:53.184
They're always already there
together in that psychic excess

00:41:53.184 --> 00:41:56.500
with which we identify
sexuality,

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.422
but in social terms the idea
that what's natural is the

00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:03.110
heterosexual and what's
unnatural,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.572
secondary, derivative,
and imitative of the

00:42:06.572 --> 00:42:11.355
heterosexual is the homosexual
is belied simply by the fact

00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:16.219
that you can't have one
conceptually without the other.

00:42:16.219 --> 00:42:19.280
It's the same thing with gender
and drag.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:25.963
Drag comes along and parodies,
mimics, and imitates gender,

00:42:25.963 --> 00:42:32.416
but what it points out is that
gender is always in and of

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:36.219
itself precisely performance.
 

00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:39.628
This could, of course,
take the form of a critique,

00:42:39.628 --> 00:42:43.376
I suppose, but we're all quite
virtuoso when it comes to

00:42:43.376 --> 00:42:44.400
performing.
 

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.199
Here I am.
 

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:48.679
I'm standing in front of you
performing professionalism.

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:50.690
I'm performing whiteness.
 

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.150
I'm performing masculinity.
 

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.449
I'm doing all of those things.
 

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:58.760
I'm quite a virtuoso:
what a performance!

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.619
&gt;
 

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:07.293
Perhaps it's kind of hard to
imagine my standing here sort of

00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:10.416
exclusively performing
masculinity as opposed to all

00:43:10.416 --> 00:43:13.050
the other things that I am
performing,

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.059
but okay, I'm certainly doing
that too.

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:19.264
I'm insecure about all of these
things, Butler argues,

00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:21.260
because I keep performing them.
 

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.882
In other words,
I keep repeating what I suppose

00:43:25.882 --> 00:43:27.389
myself to be.
 

00:43:27.389 --> 00:43:32.498
I'm not comfortable in my skin,
presumably, and I don't just

00:43:32.498 --> 00:43:36.050
relax into what I suppose myself
to be.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.469
I perform it.
 

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:42.373
It is, in other words,
a perpetual self-construction

00:43:42.373 --> 00:43:45.449
which does two things at once.
 

00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:48.940
It stabilizes my identity,
which is its intention,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.748
but at the same time it betrays
my anxiety about my identity in

00:43:53.748 --> 00:43:57.860
that I must perpetually repeat
it to keep it going.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.297
All of this is going on in this
notion of performance,

00:44:02.297 --> 00:44:07.739
so what drag does is precisely
bring all this to our attention.

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:12.481
It shows us once and for all
that that's what's at stake in

00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:17.139
the seemingly natural categories
of gender that we imagine

00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:22.289
ourselves to inhabit like a set
of comfortable old clothes.

00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:25.005
Drag, which is not at all
comfortable old clothes,

00:44:25.005 --> 00:44:26.780
reminds &gt;
 

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:32.880
us how awkward the apparel of
ourselves that we can call our

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.050
identity actually is,
and so it plays that role.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:42.036
The relationship between
identity and performance is just

00:44:42.036 --> 00:44:42.820
the same.
 

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.518
This notion of performing
identity should recall for you

00:44:46.518 --> 00:44:50.016
"signifyin'"
in the thinking of Henry Louis

00:44:50.016 --> 00:44:50.690
Gates.
 

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.719
It should recall for you,
in other words,

00:44:53.719 --> 00:44:58.005
the way in which the identity
of another is appropriated

00:44:58.005 --> 00:45:00.927
through parody,
through derision,

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:05.835
through self-distancing,
and through a sense of the way

00:45:05.835 --> 00:45:11.268
in which one is something
precisely insofar as one is not

00:45:11.268 --> 00:45:15.840
simply inhabiting the subject
position of another.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.085
It should also recall for you
the "sly civility"

00:45:20.085 --> 00:45:23.213
of the subaltern in Homi
Bhabha's thinking:

00:45:23.213 --> 00:45:27.161
the way in which double
consciousness is partly in the

00:45:27.161 --> 00:45:32.239
subject position of another,
partly in one's own in such a

00:45:32.239 --> 00:45:37.179
way that one liberates oneself
from the sense that it's the

00:45:37.179 --> 00:45:42.291
other person who is authentic
and that one is oneself somehow

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:47.730
derivative,
subordinate, and dependent.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:53.224
All of these relations ought to
gel in your minds as belonging

00:45:53.224 --> 00:45:57.010
very much to the same sphere of
thought.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:03.684
The way in which you can't have
the raw without the cooked is

00:46:03.684 --> 00:46:07.407
the way in which,
generally speaking,

00:46:07.407 --> 00:46:11.583
categories of self and other
and of identity per se

00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:15.760
simply can't be thought in
stable terms in and for

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.800
themselves,
but only relationally.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.590
Now "why is this literary
theory?"

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.463
you ask yourself,
or you have been asking

00:46:28.463 --> 00:46:29.530
yourself.
 

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:33.661
Of course, Butler gives the
greatest example at the end of

00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:37.650
her essay when she says,
"Suppose Aretha is singing

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.809
to me."
 

00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:41.485
"You make me feel,"
not a natural woman,

00:46:41.485 --> 00:46:43.539
because there's no such thing
as natural.

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:46.452
"You make me feel
like a natural

00:46:46.452 --> 00:46:49.771
woman," "you"
presumably being some

00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:53.836
hetero-normative other who shows
me what it is really to be a

00:46:53.836 --> 00:46:54.650
woman.
 

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.132
Suppose, however,
"Aretha is singing to

00:46:57.132 --> 00:47:00.250
me," or suppose she is
singing to a drag queen.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.559
That is reading.
 

00:47:01.559 --> 00:47:07.762
That's reading a song text in a
way that is, precisely,

00:47:07.762 --> 00:47:09.829
literary theory.
 

00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:11.057
Now obviously I'm thinking of
Virginia Woolf's Mr.

00:47:11.057 --> 00:47:12.438
Ramsay in writing this sentence
[gestures to sentence on

00:47:12.438 --> 00:47:13.766
chalkboard: "The
philosopher in a dark mood paced

00:47:13.766 --> 00:47:14.619
on his oriental rug."].
 

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:17.699
It's a terrible sentence for
which I apologize.

00:47:17.699 --> 00:47:20.349
Virginia Woolf never would have
written it;

00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:24.775
but just to pass in review the
way in which what we've been

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:29.429
doing is literary theory:
the Marxist critic would,

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:31.079
of course, focus on
"his"

00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:34.815
because the nexus for the
Marxist critic in this sentence

00:47:34.815 --> 00:47:37.699
would be possession--
that is to say,

00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:43.010
the deployment of capital such
that a strategy of possession

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.630
can be enacted.
 

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.186
The African American critic
would call attention to white

00:47:49.186 --> 00:47:53.222
color-coded metaphors,
insisting, in other words,

00:47:53.222 --> 00:47:57.769
that one of the ways in which
literature needs to be read is

00:47:57.769 --> 00:48:02.085
through a demystification of
processes of metaphorization

00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:06.170
whereby white is bright and
sunlit and central,

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.610
and black, as Toni Morrison
suggests in her essay,

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.045
is an absence,
is a negation,

00:48:12.045 --> 00:48:13.960
and is a negativity.
 

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.190
This is bad, a dark mood.
 

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:20.925
For the postcolonialist critic,
obviously the problem is an

00:48:20.925 --> 00:48:25.090
expropriated but also
undifferentiated commodity.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.159
By "Oriental"
you don't mean Oriental.

00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:33.219
You mean Kazakh or Bukhara or
Kilim.

00:48:33.219 --> 00:48:37.288
In other words,
the very lack of specificity in

00:48:37.288 --> 00:48:42.507
the concept suggests the reified
or objectified other in the

00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:46.929
imagination or consciousness of
the discourse.

00:48:46.929 --> 00:48:52.447
Finally, for gender theory the
masculine anger of the

00:48:52.447 --> 00:48:54.215
philosopher,
Mr.

00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:57.740
Ramsay--you remember he is so
frustrated because he can't get

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.675
past r;
he wants to get to s,

00:48:59.675 --> 00:49:00.780
but he can't get past
r--

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.766
the masculinized anger of the
philosopher masks the effeteness

00:49:05.766 --> 00:49:10.510
of the aestheticism of somebody
who has an Oriental rug.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:16.420
That in turn might mask the
effete professorial type,

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.108
that might mask an
altogether too hetero-normative

00:49:21.108 --> 00:49:26.300
sexual predation and on and on
and on dialectically if you read

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:31.239
this sentence as an aspect or
element of gender theory.

00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:32.090
Okay.
 

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:35.188
I will certainly end there,
and next time we'll take up the

00:49:35.188 --> 00:49:37.911
way in which what we've been
talking about for a few

00:49:37.911 --> 00:49:41.358
lectures,
the construction of identity

00:49:41.358 --> 00:49:44.960
and of things,
which has obviously been one of

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.420
the common features of this
course,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.789
is theorized at an even more
abstract level,

00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:53.719
with certain conclusions.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.780
PROFESSOR: So what I want to
talk about in today's lecture

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.650
is a strand in the philosophical
tradition that

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.820
looks not at the ways in which
human interconnectedness can

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.980
provide meaning and the
possibility for flourishing,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.210
but which looks rather at a
certain sort of psychological

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.370
detachment as a way of dealing
with the inevitable

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.290
vicissitudes of lived
experience.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.020
And the clearest articulation
of the outlook that we'll be

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.610
considering today in the
context of the Western

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.230
tradition can be found
in the writing of

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.250
the philosopher Epictetus.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.350
Here's a wonderful imaginary
portrait of him from 1715,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.200
sitting at a table, famously
with his cane, which he used

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.440
to walk as the result
of his limp.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.259
As you know from the reading
guide, Epictetus lived at the

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.630
beginning of two
millennia ago.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.955
He lived roughly from 50 to
130 in the common era.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:31.320
He was born in Greek-speaking
Asia Minor, and spent his life

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.010
living in the Roman Empire
during that era.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.910
He spent the early portion of
his life as a slave. There's

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.080
some dissent as to whether he
spent it until the age of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.790
thirteen or until the age of
twenty seven, but in any case,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.350
a significant portion of his
life was spent in slavery.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.980
But he eventually gained
freedom, and at some point,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.980
either before or after gaining
freedom, he studied the works

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.560
and philosophical outlook of a
tradition known as Stoicism.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.320
And the works that were produced
on his behalf that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.340
have survived are two.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.710
The first is a major four
volume collection of his

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.990
discussions of a range of
topics: questions in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.830
metaphysics, questions about
the way the world is,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.580
questions in epistemology--how
we should understand the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.470
world--and also questions
in ethics.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.860
And in addition to that has
survived the extraordinary

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.180
book that we read for today.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.290
The little forty-five epigraph
essay known as The Handbook,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.860
which was, as in the case of
Aristotle, apparently recorded

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.350
by one of Epictetus's students
and preserved in that way.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.980
Now, the work that Epictetus
produced in the context of The

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.260
Handbook was enormously
influential for most of the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.840
two thousand years that
it has been part

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.620
of the Western tradition.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.590
In particular, the frontispiece
that I used to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.970
show you a picture of Epictetus
is drawn from the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.760
library of none other than
John Adams, the second

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.410
president of the United States,
who had this book in

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:35.230
his collection in its
1715 Latin edition.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.480
(Wait until the eclipse
passes.)

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.790
Another interesting thing to
know, historically, about the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.620
volume that we're reading is
that the first English

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.270
translation of it was, in
fact, done by a great

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.180
eighteenth century woman of
letters, Elizabeth Carter.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.580
Though the translation that
we're reading is a more modern

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.280
version of it.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.910
So in this work, Epictetus takes
on many of the tenets of

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.730
classical stoicism.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.500
So we've been introduced in this
class so far first to the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.970
writings of Plato, who is a
systematic philosopher.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.530
He has views about everything,
and his commitments are to a

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.190
certain kind of rationalist,
formalist, idealist

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.310
philosophy.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.440
And we've been introduced to the
work of Aristotle through

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180
one of his writings, the
Nichomachean Ethics.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.640
But alongside those two
traditions, the Platonic

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.590
tradition and the Aristotelian
tradition, the ancient

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.120
philosophical world produced a
number of other systematic

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.320
philosophical outlooks--outlooks
that had

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.790
views about almost any question
you could ask.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.760
And among those was the view
known as Stoicism.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.090
So Stoics held, with respect to
the underlying metaphysical

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.940
facts about reality, that the
world itself is an organic

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.130
physical totality that's
governed by what they called

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.980
logos or divine reason.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.810
There is an order
to the world.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.740
And that the responsibility of
human beings, given that

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.830
order, is to cultivate a
particular kind of virtue.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.030
Virtue on the Stoic picture is
acting in accord with what

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.910
reason tells you
nature demands.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.410
It's going along with this grand
scheme of things, and

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:59.300
not trying to fight against what
is predivined for you.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.360
So it's not surprising that
elements of the Stoic

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.230
tradition get picked up
in subsequent theistic

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.640
traditions.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.470
In some ways, the Stoic view
that the world is a

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.630
well-ordered entity governed by
divine reason lies at the

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.220
heart of many of the religious
traditions that are familiar

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.310
to you today.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.120
The question, then, becomes,
what is demanded of you

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.970
prescriptively?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.850
What should you do if these
two things are the case?

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.360
And what the Stoics suggest is
that you need to accept your

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.040
fate, that it is the consequence
of the power and

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.940
goodness of the logos, even
though the ways in which it is

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.210
good for you may be unavailable
to you to see, and

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.170
that in order to do so, you need
to moderate your desires,

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.626
you need to avoid excess
emotion, and thereby come to

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.360
act in accord with reason.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.860
So the contemporary use of the
term Stoic, one who doesn't

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.950
express suffering in the face of
pain, is picking up on the

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.240
second of these prescriptive
aspects.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.880
But it's important to recognize
that as with all of

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.780
the philosophers that we're
reading, this is part of a

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.580
systematic worldview.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.280
The idea is not, we pick a
little bit here and a little

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.950
bit there and we don't worry
about how they go together.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.140
The idea is we have an idea
about the fundamental nature

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.860
of reality, a view about how we
know that, and then views

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.120
about what we ought to
do as a consequence.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.020
Now, Epictetus, in The Handbook,
is concerned only

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.620
with a small portion of
the Stoic picture.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.160
He's concerned, basically, with
writing the very first

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.630
self-help manual.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:10.380
He's trying to tell you, Mr.
or Ms. Citizen of ancient

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.020
Roman world in about the year
100, what to do if you would

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.580
like to flourish.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.090
And here's what he tells
you need to do.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.900
You need to learn how to respond
appropriately to

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.480
experience by doing
three things.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.850
You need to alter your
perceptions of the world so

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.310
that you come to apprehend
things in such a way that they

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.370
don't influence you harmfully.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:45.390
You need to alter your desires
with respect to the world.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.860
And you need to structure your
life in such a way that you

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.280
stay on the straight and narrow:
you need to structure

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.750
your social relations in ways
that will help you sustain

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.890
your commitments.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.460
And in the next slide, in an
attempt to help you read

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.740
through the text that we have,
I suggested ways of putting

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.130
each of the subpassages of the
book into one of these

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.530
categories.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.180
So, for example, when Epictetus
tells us that we

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.760
need alter our perception of
the world, there are three

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.300
specific ways that he thinks
we might go about doing it;

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.350
three components to
this instruction.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.810
The first is that we need to
properly classify things into

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.400
two categories: things over
which we have control-- and

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.520
we'll talk more about
that in a moment--

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.160
and things over which we
don't have control.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.110
So we need to get our
taxonomy down.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.390
We need also to anticipate
the way the

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.310
world typically unfolds.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.020
So we need not only to know
what is up to us and what

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.160
isn't up to us, but among the
things that aren't up to us,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.430
we need to structure our
expectations in such a way

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.420
that we are emotionally
prepared for

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.505
what will befall us.

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:15.830
And again, I'll talk
more about that

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.930
in a couple of slides.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.520
And we need to recognize--

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.570
in some ways this is a subpoint
of the first--

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:30.080
the role that judgment and
choice play in determining

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.010
whether it is the case that
experiences affect us.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.050
So those are the three things
that Epictetus says we need to

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.790
do with respect to perception,
and again, I'll give examples

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.920
of each of them in a moment.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.310
In addition, we'll go on
to the second thing

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.040
that we need to do.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.220
He tells us that we need to
cultivate appropriate desires.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.390
We need to get our desires lined
up with the world in

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.420
such a way that we aren't
subject repeatedly to

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.110
frustration.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.460
And the way we do this is by
inverting the standard

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.700
relation between desire
and the world.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:16.500
Usually, desires express a
way things aren't, but

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.280
you wish they were.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.590
I desired firmly yesterday that
there not be the eighth

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.130
snow day in three weeks
for my children.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:32.430
But the world refused to
cooperate on that question.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.900
Had I instead adjusted my
desires to the world--

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.540
I desired that things go on
exactly as logos predicts--

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.100
then I would have been
content with their

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.070
presence in my office.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.600
The second thing that Epictetus
tells us we can do

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.990
in strategizing how to cultivate
appropriate desires

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.740
is to make use of this
extraordinary human capacity

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.240
to assimilate things
from one category

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.130
to things from another.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.440
So remember when I showed you
the Wason selection task, that

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.740
funny thing which had an A, and
an F, and a 4, and a 7,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.290
and I asked which card we had
to turn over to determine

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.820
whether it was true that if
there's an A on one side,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.250
there's a 7 on the other.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:32.320
Doing that task was hard, but
when I showed you that it was

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.860
structurally identical to
another task, the task of

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.130
being shown four cards which
had ages and alcoholic or

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.460
nonalcoholic drinks, and I asked
you, which cards do you

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.260
need to turn over to verify the
truth of, if somebody is

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.560
drinking a beer, then
she is over 21.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.380
All of a sudden, you were able
to understand the difficult

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.500
problem in light of the problem
with respect which you

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.840
had traction.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.980
Epictetus points out to us that
we have a skill set for

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.290
letting go.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.850
We have a skill set for
psychological distancing.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.540
We have a skill set
for saying, "Hah!

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.530
Stuff happens, and it
doesn't matter".

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.360
And what he suggests we do,
and again, I'll give an

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.290
example of this, is to learn how
to assimilate the things

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.210
which we find hard to let go of
to the things which we find

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.720
easy to let go of, and thereby
exploit this capacity that we

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.260
have for metaphoric
understanding.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.860
Finally in this category,
Epictetus points out the

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.720
importance of habituating
yourself to the

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.540
inevitability of loss.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.690
Here's some bad news
for all of you.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.380
You're going to die.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.730
Shelly Kagan has an entire
course about this, about

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.050
coming to terms with
this inevitable

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.490
fact about human existence.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.860
But Epictetus suggests that
by taking this on board

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:18.030
profoundly, in a way affects you
not just at the level of

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.180
being able to utter the words,
"I will die someday," but at

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.670
the level of really habituating
it to your

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.780
relations to things.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.920
All of a sudden, things that
seemed incredibly important

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.635
loom less so.

00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:41.660
Finally, Epictetus points out
the importance, if you're

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.530
going to act in ways that run
counter to the norms of your

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.210
culture, the importance of
realizing that you're going to

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.360
get negative social feedback.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.210
So passage after passage
describes the importance of

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.390
resisting social pressure.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.950
When people say of
you, "You aren't

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.360
seeking honor and glory!

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.380
You must be a loser!" Epictetus
says, "Let them say

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:14.110
so, and care not what they say
about you." And as I point out

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.160
here, there are almost
fifteen passages that

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.340
identify this strategy.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.990
Finally, Epictetus gives you a
kind of trick, a persona that

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.400
he wants you to cultivate.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.180
You're supposed to be a kind
of silent type: people say

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.340
stuff, and you just calmly
don't respond.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.300
So this strategy that he's
presenting to us has these

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.880
three main parts.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.310
And what I want to do in the
next bit of lecture is to run

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.710
through some specific examples
of this, looking first at

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.140
Epictetus's text, quoting it
directly, and then suggesting

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.130
some contemporary analogues for
what it is that Epictetus

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.370
is talking about.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.800
So the opening paragraph of
Epictetus's handbook is one of

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.380
the most famous bits of
philosophical writing in the

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.560
Western tradition of the
last 2000 years.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.410
It begins as follows.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.730
"Some things are up to us and
some things are not up to us.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:19.270
Our opinions are up to us, and
our impulses, our desires, our

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.349
aversions--

00:16:20.349 --> 00:16:24.599
in short, whatever
is our own doing.

00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:28.609
But our bodies are not up to
us, that is, the physical

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:32.460
parts of ourselves, nor our
possessions, our reputations,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.750
our public offices, whatever
is not our own doing."

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.260
Now he's going to go
on and point out a

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.520
mistake you can make.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.390
"The things that are up to
us are by nature free,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.630
unhindered, and unimpeded,
whereas the things that are

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.790
not up to us are naturally
enslaved,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.780
hindered, and not our own.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.270
But if you think that things
that are naturally enslaved,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.970
things that are not up to you,
are your own, if you think

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.150
things naturally enslaved are
free, or that things that are

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:13.210
not your own are your own, you
will be thwarted, miserable,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.830
upset..." and walking around
blaming the world for

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.700
everything that's going
wrong with you.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:28.060
The mistake of confusing that
over which you have control

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.700
and that over which you lack
control leads to thwarted,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.600
upset, miserable, blamingness.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.280
By contrast, keeping these
categories straight brings the

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.490
greatest prize: "If you think
that only what is yours is

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.660
yours, and that what is not your
own is not your own, then

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.990
no one will ever coerce you, no
one will ever hinder you.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.250
You will blame no one.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.290
You will not accuse anyone.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:05.082
You will do not a single thing
unwillingly..." because the

00:18:05.082 --> 00:18:10.570
only things over which you seek
to have control are the

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.380
things over which you
do have control.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.180
And as a consequence, "no one
can coerce you," because

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.830
you're only concerned about the
things that are up to you.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.250
"No one can hinder you," because
nobody can get in the

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.570
way of the things that
are up to you.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.920
Now, any of you who has
experience with a friend or

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:43.270
relative or an acquaintance who
has taken part in one of

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:49.180
the many contemporary versions
of Epictetus in the form of a

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.960
self-help program knows that
at the heart of the

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.395
contemporary twelve step
tradition lies a version of

00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:04.380
this Epictetan thought,
articulated in prayer form,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.360
most likely first by
Reinhold Niebuhr.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.140
And that is the serenity prayer,
which you can find

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.410
decorated with hummingbirds
and daffodils--

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.470
"God grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.940
change, courage to change the
things I can't, and wisdom to

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.970
know the difference." If morning
glories aren't your

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:33.040
style, you can find it
decorated with a dog.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.030
Or an angel.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.500
Or a young child.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:46.710
You can find it on a bowl, or,
most strikingly, you can find

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:54.700
it tattooed upon your arm, or
your thigh, or your side.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:00.310
So clearly, there is something
in the Epictetan picture that

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.720
speaks to the contemporary
mind.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.250
And speaks to it in a way that
when I did a Google image

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:15.250
search for "serenity prayer,"
I found thousands and

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:20.330
thousands of images like
this in any language

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.640
you can think of.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.010
So this idea that we need to
distinguish between things

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.080
that we can change and things
that we can't, and that an

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.010
attitude of acceptance is what's
appropriate towards

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.380
things that we can't change,
whereas an attitude of effort

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.240
is what's appropriate towards
things that we can, is a

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.230
lesson that Epictetus
has offered

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.942
to the Western tradition.

00:20:50.942 --> 00:20:51.930
Second example.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:57.150
Epictetus talks to us about the
importance of emotional

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.910
regulation through anticipating
what will happen

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.110
to you in a particular
setting.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:11.980
So he says, suppose you are
going to go to the baths.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.790
When you are about to take some
sort of action, he says,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.240
remind yourself what sort
of action it is.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.652
"You're going to take a bath?

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:21.430
Put before your mind what
happens at baths!

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.270
There are people who splash,
there are people who jostle,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.350
there are people who are
insulting." If you're going to

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.920
go to the airport, remember,
you're going to have to wait

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.000
in a long line.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.070
If you're prepared for the fact
that you're going to be

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.760
sitting there, needing to wait
for your ticket, you can

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.440
adjust your emotions.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.630
"Say to yourself, I want to take
a bath." I want to go to

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.650
the airport.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.800
I want to walk across campus
on the icy sidewalks.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.700
"I want to do so in a way that
keeps my choices in accord

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.170
with nature." If you
appropriately expect things to

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.100
be as they are, then you
will not be frustrated.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.100
I want to walk across campus.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.690
It's an icy day.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.750
I realize that in walking across
campus on an icy day,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.120
I'll need to slide my feet
rather than lift them.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.110
That which had previously been
an annoyance comes to be a

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:28.980
fact about the world which
is not up to me, and

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.580
consequently, something
which does not perturb

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.010
my feeling of calm.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:43.630
Third thing Epictetus suggests
we do is to recognize that

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.850
what is upsetting to us are not
things that happen, but

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.960
rather our judgments
about those things.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.540
And you recall when I showed
you that image from the

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.730
Metropolitan Museum of
Socrates's death upon drinking

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:11.430
the hemlock, and told you that
a death done with nobility,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:17.790
recorded by a good PR
agent--something true both of

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:25.940
Socrates and of a carpenter from
Nazareth--in such cases,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:33.950
one can serve as a touchstone
for people's thought about how

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.810
to deal with human life and
its inevitabilities.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.270
So Epictetus says, what upsets
people are not things, but

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.860
their judgments about
those things.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.300
For example, "death in itself,"
he says, "must be

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.290
nothing dreadful.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.290
For if it were dreadful, then
Socrates, the great wise one,

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.120
would have felt it to be
dreadful." What's scary about

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.190
death, says Epictetus,
is not death itself.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.280
What is dreadful about death
is the judgment about death

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.310
that it is dreadful.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.730
Nothing is harmful in itself.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.920
It's up to you whether
you let it harm you.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.850
When you teach your children
not to be upset by the

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:31.510
thoughtless taunts of their
classmates, what you point out

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.790
to them is, what their
classmates say about them

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.220
can't hurt them unless
it's emotionally

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.790
disturbing to them.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:46.130
If you don't let it hurt
you, it can't hurt you.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.160
And we find voice given to
this-- here's Laurence Olivier

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.470
playing Hamlet--

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:57.230
in the famous Rosencranz and
Guildenstern scene of Hamlet,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.680
which I put up here for you,
because I understand that

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.260
there's a production of Hamlet
happening in one of the

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.720
colleges in a couple of weeks.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.070
So Hamlet is in conversation
with these two emissaries, and

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:15.070
complaining about what a rotten
place Denmark is, and

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.300
they disagree.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.010
They say, Denmark doesn't
strike us as so bad, and

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:26.860
famously, Hamlet says back, "Why
then, 'tis none to you!

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.330
For there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.720
it so."

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.070
When you walk around
the world, things

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.790
have shape and sizes.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.420
This table is rectangular.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.340
These walls are white.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.540
The temperature is
such and such.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.010
These are facts about
the world.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:54.450
Things in the world don't have
valences attached to them.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:26:01.100
It's not attached to an event
that it is good or bad.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.150
It is your assessment
of the event that

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.880
gives it that valence.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.970
That's the third Epictetan
point.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.800
Fourth point.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.470
Epictetus points out
that there are two

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.750
ways of having desires.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.730
One can, on the one hand, ask
the world to conform to what

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.320
you want, or one can ask
what you want to

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.910
conform to the world.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.970
Epictetus favors the second.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.050
"Do not want to have events
happen to you as you want them

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:46.220
to, but instead, want them to
happen as they do happen, and

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.950
your life will go well.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.200
Here's a way to get a 100%
guarantee that you'll

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.260
get what you want.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.970
Want what you get.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:02.370
If you want what you get, you
will get what you want.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.430
So contemporary philosophy has
a way of describing this.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.840
And one of the ways of thinking
about it--they use

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.220
this notion that they call
direction of fit --is to think

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.400
about what a shopping list is.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.530
So because I had some parchment
left over from that

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.180
contract that we signed with the
devil a few weeks ago, I

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.130
thought I'd use it for my
shopping list. So here I am,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.110
unenlightened by Epictetus,
and I write on my shopping

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.560
like that I would like apples,
broccoli, and lemons.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.480
And so I go to the store, and
the fulfillment of my desire

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:44.010
depends upon there being apples,
broccoli, and lemon.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:49.750
You, enlightened by Epictetus,
go to the store, look and see

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.780
what's there, pull out your
parchment paper, and make your

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.890
list. Apples, broccoli,
and lemons.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.730
So far there's no difference
between us, even though your

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.985
strategy was to shape your
desire to fit the world, and

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.870
my strategy was to
try to shape the

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.270
world to fit my desire.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:20.805
But what happens to us when the
store is out of broccoli?

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:28.996
I have on my list apples,
broccoli, and lemons.

00:28:28.996 --> 00:28:32.220
But there is no broccoli.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.210
I'm set up for frustration.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.830
You, by contrast, conform your
desires to the world.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.090
You want what you get.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:50.244
So you change your shopping
list, and everything is fine.

00:28:50.244 --> 00:28:55.970
The Epictetan idea here is that
if you shape your desires

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.650
to the way things actually
are, you will never be

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:01.900
frustrated.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.530
Fourth suggestion.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.140
Fourth?

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.080
Fifth?

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080
One of you must be
keeping count.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.150
Proper perspective.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:16.890
So Epictetus offers this
extraordinary analogy in

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.700
paragraph seven.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.360
He says, "On a voyage when your
boat has anchored, if you

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.800
want to get fresh water, you may
pick up a small shellfish

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.530
and a vegetable by the way.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.160
But you must keep your mind
fixed on the boat, and look

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.590
around frequently, in case
the captain calls.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.400
If he calls, you must let all
those other things go, so you

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.170
will not be tied up and on
the ship like livestock."

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.800
The idea is, sure, go around,
enjoy stuff in the world, but

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.700
don't let yourself get
attached to it.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.650
When a major priority occurs,
keep things in

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.440
order in your mind.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.380
"But," he continues, "This is
how it is in life." You know

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.260
how to relate to shellfish
and tomatoes.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.070
"This is how it is in life,
too." I'm quoting again.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:16.910
"If you are given a wife and a
child, instead of a vegetable

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:22.820
and a small shellfish, that
should not hinder you either.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:28.540
But if the captain calls, let
all things go and run to the

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:34.030
boat without turning back." Take
the strategies that you

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.100
have available for you for
dealing with things whose

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:43.360
transience you recognize, and
adopt those attitudes towards

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.160
things who's transience
is painful to you.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.620
"When your jug breaks," he says,
"you say: That is but a

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.050
broken jug.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:31:01.770
When your child is lost, say:
That is but a lost child."

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:07.300
This is the logical consequence
of the outlook

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:13.170
that I've been presenting
to you from Epictetus.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.970
It sounded really good when it
was the serenity prayer.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.540
It sounded pretty good
at the grocery store.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:28.620
It sounds pretty disturbing when
it's the wife and child.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.310
What is it that's going on?

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:39.850
I leave that for you as a
question, and turn now to the

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:47.040
second text that we read for
today, a great work composed

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.910
in the sixth century, in around
524, by somebody whose

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:57.230
life trajectory went almost
invertedly to the way that

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.865
Epictetus's did.

00:31:58.865 --> 00:32:03.750
Epictetus, you'll recall, was
born a slave, and tried to

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:08.300
make sense of his life
experience of suffering once

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.470
he became free.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:17.520
Boethius, by contrast, was born
into a noble family, was

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.580
enormously successful
politically in his early

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.830
years, had two sons who went on
to be enormously successful

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.930
political figures.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:36.460
And in his later years, was
imprisoned for treason.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:41.060
And because The Consolation of
Philosophy was one of the most

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.890
widely read and reproduced
works of its era--

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.020
it was read for centuries and
centuries by almost everyone--

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.360
we have gorgeous illuminated
manuscripts

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.560
that show us the story.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.530
So in this one, here's Boethius
beforehand, teaching

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:07.030
people, and here he is
afterwards, locked up in jail.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:15.380
Now in jail, in prison, where he
is tortured and suffering,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:22.250
Boethius consoles himself by
engaging in an imaginary

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:27.290
conversation with a figure
that he calls Philosophy.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:33.659
So here is Philosophy, come to
visit Boethius in his prison.

00:33:33.659 --> 00:33:41.830
And what Philosophy says to
him is, in many ways, like

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.920
what Epictetus was
talking about.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:51.230
There is, she says, a
wheel of fortune.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.420
Sometimes things start off
badly and get better.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.949
Sometimes things start off
better and get bad.

00:33:59.949 --> 00:34:06.050
But there will inevitably be a
circle to what comes to you

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:10.810
and to what is taken from you.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:19.760
And recognizing that there is
nothing to be done, other than

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.940
to recognize that this is the
pattern that life takes, is,

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:31.470
to Boethius, enormously
liberating.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:36.300
Recognizing that what goes along
with having things is

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:42.110
the possibility of losing them
allows him to come to terms

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:47.910
with the experience of
having lost all that

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:51.250
he previously had.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:56.610
What I want to do in the final
section of the lecture is to

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:01.680
return to a theme that we
discussed previously, the

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.190
question of what philosophical
utility there is to these

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:11.190
works during times of
extreme duress.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.680
So my hope, because you read an
essay by him, is that even

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.310
if you don't recognize this
gentleman, you can

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.650
guess who he is.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:25.390
This is Admiral James Stockdale,
who was, among

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:31.780
other things, imprisoned
alongside John McCain in Hanoi

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.610
during the Vietnam War, and
who was also the Vice

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:40.110
Presidential candidate running
on the independent ticket, I

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.110
understand, before
you were born.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:48.450
So James Stockdale, as he
explains to you in the

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:54.340
incredibly moving memoir that we
read for today, studied the

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.140
works of the classical
tradition.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.410
He read Epictetus.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.900
He read a bunch of
the other Stoics.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.230
He read the Iliad.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.730
He read the Odyssey.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:08.960
And all of these were part of
his cognitive and emotional

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.440
repertoire when, in Vietnam,
the following

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.490
thing happened to him.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:19.610
"It was September 9, 1965." I'm
reading now from his book.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.180
"I flew at 500 knots right into
a flak trap at treetop

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.230
level in a little A4 airplane,
the cockpit walls not even

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.630
three feet apart, which
I couldn't steer

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.770
after it was on fire.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.390
Its control system shot out.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.590
After ejection, I had thirty
seconds to make my last

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.020
statement of freedom before I
landed in the main street of a

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.820
little village right ahead, and
so help me, I whispered to

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.700
myself, 'Five years down here.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.510
At least I'm leaving the world
of technology, and entering

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.430
the world of Epictetus.'

00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.970
"Ready at hand," he said, now
quoting from The Handbook,

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.980
"Ready at hand from the
Enchiridion, The Handbook, as

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.610
I ejected from that airplane,"
was that opening paragraph

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.180
that we read a few
moments ago.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.030
"The understanding that a Stoic
always keeps separate

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.120
files in his mind for A, those
things that are up to him, and

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.530
B, those things that
are not up to him.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.460
Another way of saying this,"
says Stockdale, "is those

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.740
things that are within his
power, and those things that

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.630
are beyond his power.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.430
Still another way
of saying it.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.040
Those things that are within
the grasp of his free will,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.040
and those that lie beyond it."

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.280
All of the things over which
you do not have control,

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.370
which, in the contact of
tortured imprisonment, are a

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:56.310
huge number, are external.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:02.280
And, says Stockdale, it will
doom me to fear and anxiety if

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.340
I covet them.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:09.040
I need to let go of
the thought that

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.990
those things will change.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:16.290
However--and this is
crucial--everything in

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.160
category A is up to me.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.890
Within my power, within my will,
and those are the things

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.340
that are properly subject
for my total concern and

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.060
involvement.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.750
These matters include my
opinions, my aims, my

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:37.730
aversions, my grief, my joy,
my judgments, my attitude

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.250
about what is going on, my
own good, my own evil.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.410
"My internal character," says
Stockdale, "in circumstances

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:49.250
which are almost unimaginably
difficult.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:56.320
My character and my response to
those things are up to me."

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:05.400
And he goes on to describe the
experience of torture using a

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.760
trope that we've seen
repeatedly in

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.820
the texts we've read.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:16.380
He says, "When tortured, and
released from the torture,

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:21.330
what we contemplated was that
we had engaged in a certain

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:25.590
sort of betrayal of ourselves
and what we stood for.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.430
It was there that I learned
what Stoic harm"--

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.780
echoes of the moral harm that
we talked about when we

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.050
discussed the Jonathan
Shay work--

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.930
"a shoulder broken, a bone in
my back broken, a leg broken

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:43.340
twice, were peanuts
in comparison."

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.310
Epictetus: "Look not for any
greater harm than this

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:52.700
destroying the trustworthy,
self-respecting, well-behaved

00:39:52.700 --> 00:40:01.160
man inside you." Situations of
extremity that force people to

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.500
discover in themselves aspects
of what they are capable that

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:11.570
they don't wish to see, are
what is most harmful.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.870
When Plato says, "It will do
you no good to gain gold by

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.560
selling or enslaving
your daughter.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.700
Why, then, gain gold by selling
or enslaving your

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:27.090
soul?", he's expressing the
thought that we hear here.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:32.820
When we read in the discussions
of Jonathan Shay

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:38.250
about the experience of feeling
that one has betrayed

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.490
what one stood for--

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:44.350
that is what led to a feeling
of moral harm.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:48.700
And when Milgram's subjects
found themselves doing things

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.950
that they felt repulsive to
them, they shivered, they

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.810
shook, they felt a disorder
in their soul.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:04.710
Here, again, is an answer
to Glaucon's challenge.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:09.480
But notice that though Stockdale
is taking on board

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.850
much of the Epictetan picture,
he's rejecting the bit about

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:18.030
the tomato and the wife.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:24.600
That is, he rejects in Epictetus
the idea that social

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.520
relations aren't important.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.490
In the paragraph following the
one that I just read to you,

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.190
he writes as follows.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.130
"When people are released from
solitary confinement, when put

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.810
back in a regular cell block,
hardly an Americans came out

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.190
of that experience without
responding something like

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:46.240
this, when first whispered to
by a fellow prisoner next

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.610
door. 'You don't want
to talk to me.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:56.310
I am a traitor.' But," says
Stockdale, doing this sort of

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:00.730
listening whose importance Shay
emphasized in our reading

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:07.850
for last week, "But because we
were equally fragile, it

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.480
seemed to catch on that we all
replied something like this.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.920
'Listen, pal.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.930
There are no virgins here.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.880
You should have heard the kind
of statement I made.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.870
Snap out of it.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.820
We're all in it together.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.650
What's your name?

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.550
Tell me about yourself.'"

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:31.570
To hear that last, to hear that
you are accepted and that

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.590
there are others around you
willing to listen to the

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:39.950
experience which you found
painful, was for, I'm now

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.550
quoting again, "most new
prisoners just out of initial

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:49.080
shakedown and cold soak, a
turning point in their lives."

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.975
So the question that Stockdale's
text raises for us

00:42:53.975 --> 00:42:58.890
is the question of whether it is
possible for us to take on

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:02.690
board some of the Epictetan
picture without

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:04.620
taking on all of it.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.660
Is it possible to regulate our
desires so that we don't

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.765
expect more from the world that
it's possible to get, but

00:43:12.765 --> 00:43:16.880
to do so in such a way that
we don't thereby lose the

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.330
possibilities for the most
profound types of human

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.120
connectedness?

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.270
To that, I don't know the
answer, but I think it's worth

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.090
thinking about as a question.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:37.150
I look forward to seeing many of
you at 2:30 this afternoon.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.400
Are there questions?

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.690
We have a minute.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.462
Prof: All right,
I'm going to begin by

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.960
summarizing stuff done near the
end.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.122
Usually stuff done near the end
is maybe hurried,

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.022
or also you may have forgotten
where we were,

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:14.340
so it's helpful.
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.248
The first of what I did last
time is called Lenz and Faraday

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:23.941
law,
and it says the following - in

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:28.030
any circuit made with a real
conductor,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:37.630
if you integrate the electric
and magnetic force on a charge,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.599
unit charge around a closed
loop--this is called the

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:48.951
electromotive force--
that = - the rate of change of

00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.400
flux through that loop.
 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.310
And the flux is defined as
follows.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.445
The flux is just the integral
of the magnetic field over an

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:07.150
area whose boundary is this
loop.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.510
So this loop is a boundary of
that,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.716
so if you have a loop,
and there is some flux coming

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:16.280
out of it,
you integrate that,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.870
and you take the rate of
change.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.030
That covers a variety of
different phenomena.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.319
It's what I was trying to
explain last time.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.197
First of all,
if you ask, "Why does this

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:28.180
thing change?
 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.810
Why does the flux change?"
 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.680
it can change for two reasons.
 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.992
It can change because
B itself is changing

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:36.930
with time.
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.431
Or even if B is not
changing with time,

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:42.488
but changing with space,
if a loop happens to be moving,

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:44.989
that can also change the flux
through it.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:46.310
For whatever reason,
it will change.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.337
So this total derivative means
the total rate of change of flux

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:53.129
for the two reasons I mentioned,
or both.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.346
You can have a time dependent,
space dependent field in which

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:57.739
a loop is dragged along.
 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.400
Then at any instant,
electromotive force,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.125
namely the total force on the
charge, on the unit charge,

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.718
is given by rate of change of
flux.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:11.411
Then I said we can write this
integral, this rate of change is

00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:13.180
made up of two parts.
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.324
One was the rate of change due
to explicit time dependence of

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:26.872
the field on the old surface
another one that looks like

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:32.348
v x
B⋅dl.

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:36.318
This was what I did the last
time.

00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:38.590
And we got that result--I'll
remind you briefly,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.580
but I certainly don't want to
do it again,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.860
is that if you had a loop that
was doing this initially,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.288
it was doing that a little
later, the loop is moving,

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.931
then if you want to find the
change in flux between that one

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.660
and this one,
the natural thing to do is to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.060
integrate the flux on that loop
later,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.908
subtract from it the original
loop earlier.

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:06.346
But calculationally,
it's easier to use the fact

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:09.455
that if you want to find the
flux through a surfacing bounded

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.944
by this loop,
you don't have to simply take

00:03:11.944 --> 00:03:13.340
the easiest loop you see.
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.080
You can take any loop with that
as a boundary.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.382
And we cleverly chose the
surface to be the one containing

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:25.288
the original surface and the two
walls,

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.360
and the circular walls,
if you like,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.658
that add onto it and produce a
new surface.

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.792
So if you take one flat sheet
and glue the sides of the

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:38.330
cylinder, you get a rim here,
and that's the final surface.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.917
The advantage of doing it is
that when you find the flux at a

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.250
later time using this joint
surface,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.050
one contribution will come from
exactly the old surface,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.800
and the difference there is
only because of explicit time

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.440
dependence.
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.491
The other will come from the
sides, and the sides,

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:56.544
you can see,
are spanned by little

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:57.479
rectangles.
 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.150
This side of the rectangle is
v times dt.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.590
This side is dl.
 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.008
And the dot product with the
flux will be that term.

00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:09.188
And you rearrange the product
you get this.

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:15.840
Therefore now we can balance
that with that,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.420
or if you take a problem where
nothing is changing with time,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.480
then you can just forget this
term,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.060
and this term will match that
term.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.005
Then we are left with the
following result - the line

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:35.178
integral of the electric field
on any loop = the surface

00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:39.504
integral of the rate of change
of B over that fixed

00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:40.339
loop.
 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:45.391
So here is the fixed surface,
and here is the boundary of the

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:46.740
fixed surface.
 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.990
You have to understand the
difference.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.269
We started out with a statement
about a real physical loop.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:56.553
The physical loop was moving
and there is an emf driving

00:04:56.553 --> 00:04:58.579
charges around the loop.
 

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:00.019
It's got two parts.
 

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.009
One had to do with the motion
of the loop.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.970
The other had to do with the
changing of the field.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.565
This relation,
you see, has no need of a real

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.759
loop to be present.
 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.461
This one definitely needs a
real loop to be present,

00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:16.480
a real conducting loop,
because whose velocity is this?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.959
It's a velocity of each portion
of the loop that's moving.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:23.639
But this one is about a fixed
contour in space and has to do

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.757
with the line integral of
E around the fixed

00:05:26.757 --> 00:05:28.379
contour with this one.
 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.930
So it is true even if you
remove that loop.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.754
It's a basic statement about
electric and magnetic fields

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:36.779
that tell you that if you have a
changing magnetic field,

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.894
a time dependent magnetic
field, it will generate an

00:05:39.894 --> 00:05:43.521
electric field which,
unlike the electrostatic field,

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.449
will have a line integral which
is not 0.

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:47.389
That's the main point.
 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.160
It's a non conservative
electric field,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.242
whose origin is not electric
charges, but really changing

00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:55.699
magnetic fields.
 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.778
So this is called Faraday's law.
 

00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:03.396
Faraday's law is a very
profound statement about

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.850
electric and magnetic fields and
that's what's going to be more

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.629
important.
 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.788
But the original formula is
able to cover all situations

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:15.509
where loops move in fields.
 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.975
This - sign is due to Lenz and
the - sign is going to save your

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:20.480
life.
 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.334
The - sign tells you,
if you want to know when you

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:26.480
drag a loop or when you change
the flux through it,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.802
what is it going to do,
the - sign tells you it's going

00:06:29.802 --> 00:06:31.649
to fight the change in flux.
 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:34.750
Namely, if an emf generated,
which way will it point?

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.129
Will it move charges this way
or that way?

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.827
Answer is, it will move charges
in such a way that they produce

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:43.452
their own current,
which will produce its own

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:44.050
field.
 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.716
That field will fight the
change that you're trying to

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:48.410
produce.
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.499
In other words,
if you take a loop here and

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:55.985
you've got a bar magnet sending
some lines of flux through it,

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:59.149
you move the magnet closer to
the loop.

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.310
That's an example of rate of
change of flux through the loop.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.939
Which way will the current flow?
 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:05.420
The answer is very simple.
 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.730
You're trying to increase the
flux through the loop.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.389
It will fight it by decreasing
the flux going upwards,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.949
so it will try to produce a
flux going downwards.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:18.920
Therefore it will have a
current that looks like this.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.040
If you have a current that
looks like this,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.870
let me see, you do that and the
thumb points down,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.867
and therefore the magnetic
field it produces will oppose

00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:29.740
the field.
 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.019
So this rule is very important.
 

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.720
That's what distinguishes human
being from primates.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.350
The primates cannot do this
rule.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.473
In fact, there are lots of cave
drawings of apes trying to

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:45.973
invent solenoids,
and they always kept saying

00:07:45.973 --> 00:07:48.886
this, and they thought the
magnetic field was parallel to

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:49.509
the coil.
 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.920
So one day, we figured this out.
 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.322
That's the beginning of--it's
even better than fire,

00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:57.660
finding out that right hand
rule.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.629
Okay, so this is the rule you
should use.

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:02.535
So whenever I do any
calculation of emf,

00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:04.490
I'm not going to worry about
the sign.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.879
In the end, we'll fix the sign
so it makes sense.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:10.360
That's going to be our formula.
 

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.925
All right, so now let's
continue with this one,

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:18.190
and I remind you how we'd
explained everything regarding

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.129
the other experiment.
 

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:26.014
Remember we had a magnetic
field going into the board,

00:08:26.014 --> 00:08:28.680
only up to some point.
 

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.600
To the right of this point,
it's everywhere uniform.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.100
Then you had a loop which we
were dragging to the right.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.592
And I put a light bulb here,
and I said if you drag it,

00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:46.840
the light bulb will glow.
 

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.899
Now we can understand because
there's an emf,

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.860
and the emf is coming because
in this example,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.865
the term that really matters
for the emf is the v x

00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:56.990
B term.
 

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.750
There is no dB/dt.
 

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.259
It's fixed.
 

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.645
Somebody's holding a magnet,
shoving flux into the

00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:03.279
blackboard.
 

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.190
You're carrying the loop.
 

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.870
So it's the v x B
that gives you the emf.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.860
That's fine.
 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.950
That's the part we're not very
impressed with in this law.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.048
And let's look at the - sign.
 

00:09:13.048 --> 00:09:17.750
The - sign will be telling you
which way the current will flow.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.082
You are increasing the flux
going into the blackboard,

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:24.793
therefore the current that is
generated will try to put flux

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:26.870
coming out of the blackboard.
 

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.269
And that means the current will
flow that way.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:33.783
And that agrees with what you
expect from fundamental

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:35.908
principles,
because if the wire is moving

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:38.380
to the right,
B is into the board,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.570
v x B will
produce an emf this way.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.620
So we understand everything
here.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.881
I also explained to you that
the energy balance is that the

00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.860
work done on the wire,
on the light bulb,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.779
is paid for by the person
pulling this loop,

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:55.360
because the minute you have a
current,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.850
that current doesn't like to be
dragged across a field.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.307
There is some BlI force
and when you overcome the force

00:10:01.307 --> 00:10:04.481
with your mechanical force,
you convert mechanical energy

00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:05.899
to electrical energy.
 

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:10.243
There's one subtlety that is
usually overlooked,

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:14.586
which is the following - if you
go to this wire,

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:17.360
here is the piece of wire.
 

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.724
There are some charges in here
the wire has moving at a

00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:21.970
velocity v.
 

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.220
And there is a B
somewhere, maybe like that.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.340
And we said v x B
is a certain force.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.490
But if there's a current
flowing in the wire,

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.168
it also has a speed u along the
wire.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.700
This is something we saw even
in the loop problem.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:45.727
So the real force of a charge
on the wire is not simply

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:51.323
v x B,
but v u x

00:10:51.323 --> 00:10:55.879
B⋅dl.
 

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.313
Because it's not just the
motion of the wire that we take

00:10:58.313 --> 00:11:00.313
for the velocity,
because charges are moving in

00:11:00.313 --> 00:11:00.879
the wire.
 

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:05.350
The net velocity is v
u, to some number like

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.899
that.
 

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.875
But when you do the emf,
you don't have to worry about

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:13.100
this part of the velocity along
the wire.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.850
I'll give you a second to
figure out why.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.240
But just take that part.
 

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.788
Why am I allowed to ignore it?
 

00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:22.615
Because u x B is
perpendicular to u,

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.350
and dl is parallel to
u.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.192
u is the direction of
motion in the wire and dl

00:11:28.192 --> 00:11:29.139
is along the wire.
 

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:31.565
So if you take a vector,
cross it with something else

00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:34.129
and take the dot product with
another vector parallel to

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:35.389
itself, you will get 0.
 

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:39.557
That's why you don't worry
about the extra term in

00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:41.259
computing the emf.
 

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:43.725
This is a subtle point for
those of you who wake up with a

00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:45.240
sweat in the middle of the
night.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.840
I'm just trying to tell you,
calm down, it's okay.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.639
It's really present as a force,
but not as an emf.

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:57.837
In fact, it's going to push the
charge perpendicular to the wire

00:11:57.837 --> 00:12:00.769
and not do any work going around
the loop.

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:04.490
So this is one topic.
 

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:10.812
I'm going to illustrate the
reality of this result by

00:12:10.812 --> 00:12:18.350
describing to you the operation
of what's called a betatron.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.607
You remember the cyclotron,
what it does,

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:22.259
right?
 

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:27.210
You had these Ds and the charge
was jumping around from one D to

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.238
the other when you put a certain
voltage, so this is positive and

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:33.808
that's negative.
 

00:12:33.808 --> 00:12:37.293
It bends in a magnetic field
which is going in the plane into

00:12:37.293 --> 00:12:38.279
the blackboard.
 

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.692
Then it gets another kick and
when it comes here,

00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:43.405
you reverse the polarity,
so that this becomes and this

00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:44.110
becomes -.
 

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:49.518
It picks up another kick in
velocity and it keeps doing

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:50.220
that.
 

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.043
And the remarkable thing that
was noticed is if you write the

00:12:54.043 --> 00:12:57.653
equation mv^(2)/R,
which is the force you need to

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:03.808
bend into a circle,
that's going to be qvB.

00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:12.307
So if you cancel the velocity
here, you find v/R to be

00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:14.288
qB/m.
 

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:18.445
v/R is the angular
frequency with which it rotates

00:13:18.445 --> 00:13:21.340
and that's independent of the
radius.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.815
Therefore you have to reverse
the polarity with the same

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:28.354
regularity, with the same
frequency, even as the particle

00:13:28.354 --> 00:13:30.440
picks up more and more speed.
 

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.634
It's not that you have to keep
changing the rate at which you

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:33.330
flip the voltage.
 

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.678
Then you don't have any means
of doing it.

00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:37.494
But if it's flipping at a
definite rate,

00:13:37.494 --> 00:13:40.284
then of course you can get a
generator that generates voltage

00:13:40.284 --> 00:13:42.240
at that rate and you can make it
work.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.822
The key to all of that was this
remarkable fact that omega does

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:48.820
not depend on the radius.
 

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.450
But that has a weakness that as
the particle picks up speed,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.202
eventually you will have to use
the fact that the real momentum

00:13:57.202 --> 00:14:01.908
of a particle is not mv,
but mv divided by this

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:06.721
factor,
which comes from relativistic

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:07.960
effects.
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.120
Then you can show the
centrifugal force you need.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.873
The centripetal force you need
is not given by

00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:19.674
mv/R,
but rather it's given by this

00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:25.794
momentum times omega,
where momentum is given by this

00:14:25.794 --> 00:14:27.879
formula and not by this.
 

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:30.395
Now that's a homework problem
where you'll get enough time to

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:31.110
think about it.
 

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.359
That will show you that once
the momentum formula deviates

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.779
appreciably from p = mv
to p equal to this,

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:40.570
then condition for the
cyclotron orbit,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.960
the frequency being independent
of radius will fail.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.061
Essentially,
as the particle gets more

00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:49.048
velocity, it's harder to push
it.

00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:52.341
Your ability to accelerate it
changes and therefore this

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.418
condition fails.
 

00:14:53.418 --> 00:14:58.077
So the cyclotron can accelerate
particles only up to velocities

00:14:58.077 --> 00:15:02.058
where the relativistic
corrections are unimportant.

00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:05.297
But the betatron,
which I'm going to describe to

00:15:05.297 --> 00:15:07.673
you,
is a device that actually

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:12.142
manages to accelerate particles
even as their motion becomes

00:15:12.142 --> 00:15:16.191
relativistic,
even as the momentum is given

00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:17.808
by that formula.
 

00:15:17.808 --> 00:15:20.340
So I will tell you how that
works.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:26.888
You've got these poles of some
magnet, the side view,

00:15:26.888 --> 00:15:30.539
producing a magnetic field.
 

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.149
Let's look at the top view.
 

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:35.798
In the top view,
you've got some magnetic field.

00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:43.558
Let's say it's coming out of
the blackboard.

00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:48.333
So if you put a particle here,
some velocity v,

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:53.289
v x B is to the
right and it will bend.

00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:55.330
But here's what we want to do.
 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:02.604
We're going to have it go in a
circle of definite radius and

00:16:02.604 --> 00:16:05.070
yet pick up speed.
 

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.610
I'll show you how that happens.
 

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:12.528
So what you do is,
this is not a fixed bar magnet.

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:16.303
It's an electromagnet,
the current in which you're

00:16:16.303 --> 00:16:21.080
changing, and therefore the
field is in fact time dependent.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.504
Furthermore,
the field will be strong near

00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:29.500
the middle and weak near the
edges.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.288
Now if that field is changing,
then if you draw any loop of

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:38.005
radius r,
the flux through that loop is

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:39.080
changing.
 

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.613
Therefore the electric field
will obey this condition,

00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:44.678
2Πr times E.
 

00:16:44.678 --> 00:16:51.620
The electric field will then
also be going around in circles.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.440
It will encircle the magnetic
field.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.410
If the magnetic field is coming
from ceiling to the floor,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.330
electric field will be
horizontal, horizontal circles.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.126
And by symmetry,
they'll be circles centered at

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:03.769
the center of the magnet.
 

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:06.160
That's the direction of the
electric field.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.915
This field coming from top to
bottom, if it changes in

00:17:08.915 --> 00:17:11.984
strength, will generate a field
in a horizontal plane that's

00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:13.390
going round in circles.
 

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.006
So if you put a charge there,
you'll push it and it will

00:17:17.006 --> 00:17:17.730
speed up.
 

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.009
How big is the field?
 

00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:21.470
Well, the field is constant on
the circle of radius r.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.298
It's pointing azimuthally.
 

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:26.949
So its line integral is just
2Πr times E at

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:27.630
r.
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:34.364
That's going to be = (forget
the - sign) d/dt of

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:40.848
B⋅dA
inside that circle.

00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:43.752
Now that
B⋅dA

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:47.345
I'm going to write as
Πr^(2) ties some

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:48.950
average B.
 

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.348
That's how we define the
average.

00:17:50.348 --> 00:17:53.707
The total flux through the
radius when the field is varying

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:56.950
with distance can always be
written as the area times the

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.250
average B and the time
derivative of that is,

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:07.233
if you like,
d/dt of

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:13.950
B_bar.
 

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:22.480
So I'm going to write now the
equation I get.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.506
E of r,
if you solve for it,

00:18:26.506 --> 00:18:32.103
is going to be r/2 times
d/dt of the average

00:18:32.103 --> 00:18:33.380
B.
 

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:40.390
Average is inside the circle of
radius r.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.349
Now if that's the electric
field you multiply both sides by

00:18:44.349 --> 00:18:48.720
q, which is the charge of
the object, that's the force.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.430
That force is the rate of
change of momentum.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:19:00.226
So rate of change of momentum
is qr/2 times rate of

00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:04.328
change of the average field.
 

00:19:04.328 --> 00:19:06.731
Now if this is the rate of
change and that's equal to the

00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:11.295
rate of change of B,
then p of t =

00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:18.210
qr/2 times the average
B at time t.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.579
Actually, I'm making one
assumption here.

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:26.960
Do you know what that is?
 

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.910
I'm assuming the initial
momentum was 0,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.058
because if you know only the
rate of change,

00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:32.710
you can add a constant to it.
 

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.548
So I'm assuming that t =
0, p was 0.

00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:38.900
So that's the momentum of this
guy after time t.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.323
So as the average B is
growing, the momentum is

00:19:42.323 --> 00:19:46.200
growing, it has this value at
this instant at that radius.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.733
Now what else do we need to
make sure that solution makes

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:50.240
sense.
 

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:56.288
What do you need?
 

00:19:56.288 --> 00:19:57.720
Is there anything else to this
story?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.589
Yes?
 

00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:01.210
Would you like to guess?
 

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.770
If a particle picks up speed,
why would it continue to be in

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.400
that orbit that I've shown here.
 

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.089
What does it take to keep it in
that orbit.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:14.818
Pardon me?
 

00:20:14.818 --> 00:20:16.818
Student:  The force of
that entity.

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:18.470
Prof: Which force,
I'm sorry?

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.942
Student:  If it's in an
orbit of constant radius,

00:20:20.942 --> 00:20:23.414
then the velocity's increasing
the force, and that's the

00:20:23.414 --> 00:20:24.000
increase.
 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.460
Prof: Right,
but at a given velocity.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.596
Even at a given velocity,
you need a force to bend

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:29.730
something into a circle.
 

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.778
You guys know that.
 

00:20:31.778 --> 00:20:34.710
Remember that force from last
term?

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.670
That force is mv^(2)
over r.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.923
That comes from saying that the
particle has a velocity momentum

00:20:43.923 --> 00:20:46.042
like that now,
momentum like that a little

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:46.558
later.
 

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:49.515
There's a change in momentum
pointing towards the center and

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.318
you can calculate that as
mv^(2) over r.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:55.279
So who's going to provide that
force?

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.670
In other words,
things don't move in a circle

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.788
unless you pull them into the
center.

00:20:59.788 --> 00:21:05.380
My question is,
who's going to do that for this

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.108
guy?
 

00:21:06.108 --> 00:21:08.690
Who's going to provide that
force?

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:18.328
Any idea?
 

00:21:18.328 --> 00:21:20.230
Don't worry about the sign or
anything.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:27.359
Is there anything that can push
this guy towards the center?

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.509
Want to make a guess?
 

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:29.288
Student:  The magnetic
field?

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.690
Prof: It's the magnetic
force,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.946
because that's a charged
particle, moving in a magnetic

00:21:33.946 --> 00:21:36.380
field,
and the force of that is

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.529
q times v times
B.

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:43.579
But this B is the
B at the orbital radius.

00:21:43.579 --> 00:21:44.759
It's not the average B.
 

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:47.578
This is the B where the
particle really is.

00:21:47.578 --> 00:21:49.480
So we're going to keep the
particle at a fixed radius.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.118
It's the B at that
radius that matters.

00:21:54.118 --> 00:22:01.536
Therefore you cancel the
velocity, you find that mv =

00:22:01.536 --> 00:22:07.740
qrB_0 and that's
the momentum.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:16.088
But we also saw the momentum at
time t = this.

00:22:16.088 --> 00:22:18.598
They are both expressions for
the momentum at time t.

00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:21.442
This just says the magnetic
field hopefully is strong enough

00:22:21.442 --> 00:22:22.068
to bend it.
 

00:22:22.068 --> 00:22:24.853
That's the field that you need,
but I'm just going to equate

00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:26.410
the momentum computed two ways.
 

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.432
That tells me this interesting
result, that

00:22:31.432 --> 00:22:38.848
B_0 is ½
B_average.

00:22:38.848 --> 00:22:41.019
So let's summarize what I'm
saying.

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:42.858
I want you to visualize this.
 

00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:45.289
You've got a magnetic field
from ceiling to floor.

00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:47.140
It's pointing down, let's say.
 

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.798
You put a little charge there,
it won't do anything.

00:22:50.798 --> 00:22:54.088
But if you change that field,
because of this law,

00:22:54.088 --> 00:22:56.086
Faraday's law,
the change in field will

00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:58.190
produce a circulating electric
field,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.827
that circles the changing
magnetic flux and going around

00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:03.065
in circles,
and it will accelerate the

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:07.037
particle along a circle,
because it is bending around a

00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:07.680
circle.
 

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.097
But at the same time,
you need the right magnetic

00:23:11.097 --> 00:23:13.519
field to keep it in that circle.
 

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:16.368
But the particle is speeding up.
 

00:23:16.368 --> 00:23:19.480
Therefore the force needed is
also increasing.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.122
So you're in addition to
increasing the average field

00:23:22.122 --> 00:23:25.134
over the loop over the circle,
to produce the emf,

00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:29.212
you need to have the right
field at the boundary to provide

00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:33.432
exactly the right force needed
to keep it on an orbit of that

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:35.190
radius at that time.
 

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.631
Therefore the story is,
as time passes,

00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.585
the field increases in
strength, the particle's

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.769
tangential momentum increases.
 

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:45.748
And the radial force to keep it
in orbit at the tangential

00:23:45.748 --> 00:23:48.786
momentum also increases,
and the demand when you look at

00:23:48.786 --> 00:23:50.990
it says that the field at the
periphery,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.965
where it's rotating,
must be ½

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.618
the average field.
 

00:23:55.618 --> 00:23:58.118
So you'll have to build a
magnet very carefully.

00:23:58.118 --> 00:24:01.185
You can always build a magnet
whose field varies as you go off

00:24:01.185 --> 00:24:03.750
center that gets weak when you
go off the center.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.854
It should go off the center in
such a way that by the time you

00:24:07.854 --> 00:24:11.016
come to this radius,
the field strength there is

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.430
half the average.
 

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.015
Once you design a magnet that
way you just crank up the

00:24:15.015 --> 00:24:18.078
current and let a particle go at
the radius, it will pick up more

00:24:18.078 --> 00:24:19.420
and more and more speed.
 

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.763
Even though it's going faster
and faster, the field at the

00:24:22.763 --> 00:24:26.402
orbit will be just right to push
it towards the center with the

00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:27.400
right amount.
 

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.001
One of the homework problems
was to show something I made a

00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:33.299
big deal about,
namely, here I've used

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:35.038
relativistic kinematics.
 

00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:37.833
Momentum was mv,
the force to the center is

00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:38.858
mv^(2)/r.
 

00:24:38.858 --> 00:24:42.087
But the homework problem shows
you that even in the

00:24:42.087 --> 00:24:44.865
relativistic case,
the momentum is mv

00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:47.900
divided by all of that,
this is still true.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.548
So the betatron,
in spite of the simple example

00:24:51.548 --> 00:24:54.007
I've given here,
actually works,

00:24:54.007 --> 00:24:57.259
even if the particle is
relativistic.

00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:59.832
In fact, the only reason the
betatron eventually fails is

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.358
that when particles start going
in a circle at very,

00:25:02.358 --> 00:25:04.430
very high speed and they are
charged,

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.940
they start radiating energy.
 

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.317
That's another aspect that we
have not discussed in our course

00:25:09.317 --> 00:25:11.305
yet,
but accelerating charges

00:25:11.305 --> 00:25:13.163
radiate energy,
and eventually,

00:25:13.163 --> 00:25:14.578
you cannot put in enough
energy.

00:25:14.578 --> 00:25:17.200
It radiates more than you can
give it.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.028
So then you need other things
called synchrotrons.

00:25:19.028 --> 00:25:22.207
So that's a constant struggle
for people building

00:25:22.207 --> 00:25:23.200
accelerators.
 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.068
It's easy to get more and more
velocity, but if you bend them

00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:29.326
into a circle,
they start radiating,

00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:31.390
emit gamma rays,
emit light.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.923
And that energy eventually is
so big that you cannot

00:25:35.923 --> 00:25:39.480
compensate it with your pushing
force.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.390
So the next topic I want to
discuss is in a totally

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.471
different vein,
and that has to do with more

00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:54.608
practical issues like this one.
 

00:25:54.608 --> 00:26:03.420
This is going to be a power
generator.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.325
Remember, I told you one way to
make electricity in your house

00:26:07.325 --> 00:26:11.230
is to take this coil and tell
somebody to carry it and run.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.078
Then the light bulb will glow
here.

00:26:14.078 --> 00:26:16.747
Or you can have somebody carry
the magnet the other way and the

00:26:16.747 --> 00:26:18.338
light bulb will glow in your
house.

00:26:18.338 --> 00:26:22.000
But there's a more clever way
to make the light bulb glow,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.250
which I think you guys have
seen.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.253
By the way, I think these are
all things you have seen in one

00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.406
form or another,
so I'm not going to put too

00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:31.108
much energy into these things.
 

00:26:31.108 --> 00:26:34.509
I just want to tell you things
you may have missed.

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:36.500
So here's some magnet.
 

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.093
Here's some field lines going
from here to there,

00:26:41.093 --> 00:26:42.720
north to south.
 

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:52.279
In that magnet you put a coil,
which looks like this.

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:55.627
The plane of the coil that's
pointing in that direction of

00:26:55.627 --> 00:26:57.699
the magnetic moment,
or if you want,

00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:59.329
the area vector points that
way,

00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:03.950
the B field is horizontal.
 

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:09.056
Now if you spin that coil,
I think you know what will

00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:09.940
happen.
 

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.583
The flux through the coil is
going to change and the rate of

00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:15.930
change of flux will give you an
emf.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.380
So what is the emf?
 

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.038
First you've got to find the
flux through the coil.

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:23.001
The flux through the coil is
the area of the coil,

00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:25.662
the magnetic field,
times cosine of the angle

00:27:25.662 --> 00:27:26.690
between them.
 

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.759
This would be angle theta in
the figure.

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:36.567
But you have attached this to
an axle and you're going to just

00:27:36.567 --> 00:27:39.088
keep spinning it mechanically.
 

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:42.769
And you agree to spin it at a
uniform rate,

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:43.470
omega.
 

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.759
So theta is omega t.
 

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:52.392
Then you can see that the emf,
which is

00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:59.707
-dΦ/dt
= ABsinωt

00:27:59.707 --> 00:28:03.730
times another ω.
 

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.450
That's the emf.
 

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.079
Now what about the - sign.
 

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:08.858
Forget the - sign.
 

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:12.961
We can figure out what the
emf--which way the current will

00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:13.970
try to flow.
 

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.358
Look at this coil here.
 

00:28:16.358 --> 00:28:19.368
Let's decide how we want to
turn this guy.

00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:22.979
If you turn it in the manner
I've shown here,

00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:27.817
it's going from some angle like
that, eventually to an angle

00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:31.098
perpendicular to the magnetic
field.

00:28:31.098 --> 00:28:32.779
What's happening to the flux
through it?

00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:37.250
Is it increasing or decreasing?
 

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.490
Increasing.
 

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.759
Increasing in this direction.
 

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:45.248
So it will fight it by trying
to produce a flux going in the

00:28:45.248 --> 00:28:46.490
opposite direction.
 

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.601
Therefore it will try to
produce a current that looks

00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:50.318
like this.
 

00:28:50.318 --> 00:28:52.470
That's the direction of your
emf.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.509
Emf, given a chance,
will drive a current as shown

00:28:56.509 --> 00:29:01.374
here, because that one by right
hand rule will have the flux

00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:03.598
going the opposite way.
 

00:29:03.598 --> 00:29:05.410
So that's why I don't care
about the - sign.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.480
I know which way the current
will flow if I let it flow.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.461
But now if this is an open
circuit like this,

00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:18.528
the two wires sit here,
what do you think will happen?

00:29:18.528 --> 00:29:22.420
What do you think will happen
in that case?

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.396
If you're an electric charge in
that wire, what will you do

00:29:27.396 --> 00:29:28.769
under the emf?
 

00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:33.198
You will follow the emf and you
will run from this terminal to

00:29:33.198 --> 00:29:34.358
that terminal.
 

00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:39.029
So let me blow up that picture
for you.

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:44.846
If the current is trying to go
that way, then charges will

00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:48.420
leave like this and pile up
here.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.450
They cannot go very far because
it's an open circuit.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.453
At some point,
these guys piled up here--so

00:29:56.453 --> 00:30:02.078
this is the induced electric
field obeying that equation.

00:30:02.078 --> 00:30:03.930
In fact, it's not induced
electric field.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.210
This is just the v x
B force on the magnet,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.509
on the charges.
 

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:12.882
But then these charges will
produce and electrostatic force

00:30:12.882 --> 00:30:15.946
called the Coulomb field,
which is the electric field due

00:30:15.946 --> 00:30:18.816
to charges,
which will oppose it,

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:22.808
till the two cancel inside the
wire.

00:30:22.808 --> 00:30:25.061
In other words,
this wire is assumed to be a

00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:26.108
perfect conductor.
 

00:30:26.108 --> 00:30:28.528
You all know that you cannot
have an electric field in a

00:30:28.528 --> 00:30:29.410
perfect conductor.
 

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.368
You can say,
"Hey, why do you have an

00:30:31.368 --> 00:30:32.660
electric field now?"
 

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.839
The real statement is,
in a perfect conductor,

00:30:34.839 --> 00:30:37.506
you cannot have any net charge
on the charged particles,

00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:39.930
because then they will pick up
infinite speed.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.053
So if there's a v x
B force,

00:30:42.053 --> 00:30:44.848
that is actually canceled by an
electrostatic force.

00:30:44.848 --> 00:30:49.940
The two of them cancel inside
the wire.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.348
And the line integral of the
v x B,

00:30:53.348 --> 00:30:55.910
which is the emf,
will numerically equal the

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.244
integral of the electric field
from this terminal to that

00:30:59.244 --> 00:31:00.019
terminal.
 

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:02.455
But now if you put the whole
thing in a box and you don't

00:31:02.455 --> 00:31:04.108
know anything and you come
outside,

00:31:04.108 --> 00:31:06.369
what you will find is this will
be positively charged,

00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:07.578
this will be negatively charged.
 

00:31:07.578 --> 00:31:11.826
There'll be voltage between
those two which will numerically

00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:13.049
equal your emf.
 

00:31:13.049 --> 00:31:16.690
This will be the polarity.
 

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.130
So I'm giving you an option.
 

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.632
If you don't want to look under
the hood, you simply say

00:31:20.632 --> 00:31:22.680
whenever you rotate a coil,
you get an emf.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.349
That emf is like a voltage.
 

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:26.048
Case closed.
 

00:31:26.048 --> 00:31:28.493
But if you really want to know
what's happening inside the wire

00:31:28.493 --> 00:31:31.835
that made up that coil,
inside the wire the net force

00:31:31.835 --> 00:31:36.279
on the charges is actually 0,
or an infinitesimal amount left

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:38.058
to make them move this way.
 

00:31:38.058 --> 00:31:41.419
That's because the v x
B force is countered by

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:44.892
an internal electrostatic force
due to pile up of charges that

00:31:44.892 --> 00:31:47.170
opposes it so that inside it's
free.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.140
It's just like the ski
experiment I told you,

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.029
where you have a ski lift.
 

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:54.987
You come down the ski lift,
you come here,

00:31:54.987 --> 00:31:58.088
and here is the lift that
carries you up.

00:31:58.088 --> 00:32:01.980
But during the time gravity's
acting down and the force of the

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.660
lift is exactly equal to mg and
gravity.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.999
And once you're outside the
lift, it's gravity that brings

00:32:07.999 --> 00:32:09.230
you down back here.
 

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.407
Similarly, inside the thing the
two guys are opposed to each

00:32:12.407 --> 00:32:12.838
other.
 

00:32:12.838 --> 00:32:15.875
Outside this region there is no
v x B force,

00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:18.698
but the electrostatic force has
a line integral that's

00:32:18.698 --> 00:32:20.190
independent of the path.
 

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.970
So integral that way the same
as the integral that way.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.563
So if you put a circuit here,
it will produce a voltage

00:32:26.563 --> 00:32:30.490
difference with this being
positive, that being negative.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:35.730
So the bottom line is that if
you have open circuit,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.440
and if you put a volt meter
that measures voltage,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.809
you will get exactly that time
dependent voltage.

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:44.200
So this voltage is not constant.
 

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.019
It will look like this,
t versus V.

00:32:51.019 --> 00:32:54.080
So in the linear loop,
when you drag it and run,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.970
you get a constant voltage.
 

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.285
Here you get a time dependent
one, and most of the supplies in

00:33:00.285 --> 00:33:03.608
the world are either 50 cycles
or 60 cycles,

00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:09.509
and they come from rotating a
coil in this magnetic field.

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:19.612
Now how much is the work done
by the person rotating this coil

00:33:19.612 --> 00:33:21.598
right now?
 

00:33:21.598 --> 00:33:24.814
I'm telling you the coil is
made of massless,

00:33:24.814 --> 00:33:26.858
perfectly conducting wire.
 

00:33:26.858 --> 00:33:32.079
What work do you have to do to
spin it?

00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.269
Any ideas?
 

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:37.328
Student: 
&gt;

00:33:37.328 --> 00:33:38.230
Prof: Which one,
dE?

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.920
Student:  Edq.
 

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.366
Prof: Yeah,
but I'm saying the total

00:33:42.366 --> 00:33:46.038
force--you don't have to do any
work because there is no current

00:33:46.038 --> 00:33:47.670
flowing in the coil yet.
 

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.480
There's no current.
 

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:56.670
If there's no current,
it's BlI force.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.362
So what we want to do then is
do something more interesting

00:34:01.362 --> 00:34:05.569
where you bring it here,
connect it to a resistor.

00:34:05.569 --> 00:34:07.950
Then the current will flow.
 

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.050
Now we're getting something.
 

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.239
Till now, we were getting
nothing from the generator.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:14.579
In other words,
look, where's a socket here?

00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:16.530
That's a socket.
 

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.739
There's voltage there waiting
for you to use.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.288
But you don't pay,
because you're not drawing any

00:34:22.288 --> 00:34:22.820
current.
 

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.789
You don't pay just because
someone gave you the voltage.

00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:29.184
You take a battery in your
hand, you don't run a current,

00:34:29.184 --> 00:34:30.699
you don't pay anything.
 

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.639
That's what the situation is.
 

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.567
But if I stick my fingers into
that socket, then there is

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:36.090
current.
 

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.099
Then we'll all pay.
 

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.550
The loss is I^(2)R,
right?

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.565
That's when you've got to
explain to yourself,

00:34:43.565 --> 00:34:45.239
who is paying for this?
 

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:50.489
Because we can see that the
power in the resistor will be

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:51.989
I^(2)R.
 

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:55.128
I, if you want,
is E^(2)/R,

00:34:55.128 --> 00:34:58.840
emf or voltage squared over
R.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.268
That gives me
ω^(2)A^(2)B^(2)

00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:06.980
sin^(2)ωt/R.
 

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.547
That's the rate at which this
power is consumed by the

00:35:09.547 --> 00:35:10.079
resistor.
 

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:15.489
Someone's got to pay for that.
 

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:17.650
The someone,
I think you can imagine now,

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.197
now that I've closed the
circuit and a current is

00:35:20.197 --> 00:35:24.423
actually flowing,
there is a torque on that loop

00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:26.639
in a magnetic field.
 

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:28.920
The torque on any loop,
you'll remember,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.559
is μ x B.
 

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:33.610
μ is the magnetic
moment.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.534
That happens to be area of the
loop, current in the loop,

00:35:37.534 --> 00:35:42.090
B times the sine of the
angle between area and B.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.349
That is torque.
 

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:48.550
So that's the torque that
you've got to fight.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.268
So you will have to apply
mechanical force to turn that.

00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:54.675
If you're turning the crank by
hand, the minute you put a load,

00:35:54.675 --> 00:35:56.599
you'll find it's hard to turn
it.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:59.404
And the power,
just like power is force times

00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:03.101
velocity, for rotational motion
it is torque times angle of

00:36:03.101 --> 00:36:03.929
velocity.
 

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:11.409
That gives me ABωI
sinθ.

00:36:11.409 --> 00:36:14.336
That's the power,
the mechanical power,

00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:16.110
P_m.
 

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.115
But then that =
ABω

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:24.639
sinθ times
I.

00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:26.400
What is I?
 

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.980
The current in the loop is the
emf divided by R.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.739
If you put the emf I got for
you somewhere,

00:36:34.739 --> 00:36:42.300
then you'll find it's equal to
A^(2)B^(2)ω^(2)/R

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.079
sin^(2)θ.
 

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:47.518
So this is how you have to
balance.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:50.809
We did a similar calculation
here.

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:54.148
This is also a generator and if
you find out the minute there's

00:36:54.148 --> 00:36:57.360
a current flowing here,
you have I^(2)R or

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.750
E^(2)/R energy loss here.
 

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.871
But the minute the current
flows through the loop,

00:37:01.871 --> 00:37:04.556
you will not be able to pull it
to the right without paying the

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:04.989
force.
 

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.556
That force times the velocity
will be the power and the two

00:37:07.556 --> 00:37:08.219
will balance.
 

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:12.393
Similarly, here is a rotational
problem, and the torque times

00:37:12.393 --> 00:37:16.079
angular velocity will exactly
equal the power here.

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:18.487
So the generators,
you've got hydroelectric

00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:20.782
generators,
or you've got steam,

00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:24.335
turbines that are spinning,
initially, because the turbines

00:37:24.335 --> 00:37:25.989
in the real world have a real
mass,

00:37:25.989 --> 00:37:27.159
it's not easy to spin them.
 

00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:29.268
You spend some power,
but if you ignore that,

00:37:29.268 --> 00:37:32.768
the minute you put a device in
your house into the socket,

00:37:32.768 --> 00:37:34.909
your toaster,
you start drawing current,

00:37:34.909 --> 00:37:37.869
that current's got to flow
right through the generator.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:40.409
It's going to make it that much
harder to rotate the generator.

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:43.050
That's when the steam turbines
do their work.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:48.030
That's when they pay for it.
 

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:54.478
Okay, so this is the end of the
story about how to get power out

00:37:54.478 --> 00:37:57.550
of this and how it balances.
 

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:11.085
I'm going to a fairly different
notion called inductors and

00:38:11.085 --> 00:38:14.119
inductance.
 

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:16.190
So here is the following
phenomenon.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:23.403
I take some cardboard tube and
around the cardboard tube I wrap

00:38:23.403 --> 00:38:30.268
some wire and I connect this to
some alternating voltage.

00:38:30.268 --> 00:38:36.065
That means there is going to be
some magnetic flux going through

00:38:36.065 --> 00:38:37.170
that coil.
 

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.594
Then I bring a second wire,
maybe I wrap it round a couple

00:38:41.594 --> 00:38:45.320
of times or a few times,
and I leave it there.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.110
That's it.
 

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:52.300
The question is,
what will happen if I look at

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.909
the two ends of this wire?
 

00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:57.018
You can see what will happen.
 

00:38:57.018 --> 00:39:02.791
If this current changes,
the flux through this solenoid

00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:03.860
changes.
 

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.789
That means the flux through
this little guy alsochanges.

00:39:06.789 --> 00:39:09.579
Every loop has flux going
through it and that also

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:10.150
changes.
 

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.380
So there's going to be an emf.
 

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.670
For every turn of wire here,
they'll be an emf equal to the

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.090
rate of change of flux.
 

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.262
And therefore that emf will try
to draw a current,

00:39:20.262 --> 00:39:24.094
just like before,
and the charges will pile up

00:39:24.094 --> 00:39:27.159
maybe like this at some instant.
 

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:33.380
Now if you are outside all of
this, you will just think there

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.699
is a voltage available to you.
 

00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:40.380
But I want you to understand
the origin of that voltage.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.110
This is like the ski lift here.
 

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:46.306
Charges, once they come into
this region, are pushed up the

00:39:46.306 --> 00:39:49.780
wire and later on,
if you're connected to a load,

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.880
they can drive a current.
 

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.739
This is just like the generator
I had there,

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:57.195
except the flux is changing not
due to any mechanical motion of

00:39:57.195 --> 00:40:01.349
a coil in a fixed field,
but it's fixed coils in a

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:04.000
changing magnetic field.
 

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.288
So you understand,
when I change the current here,

00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:07.690
you will get a voltage here.
 

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.664
This is the first thing Faraday
noticed, is that he thought

00:40:10.664 --> 00:40:13.230
first that magnetic field may
produce a current.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.369
It didn't.
 

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:17.460
Then he found a changing
magnetic field is able to

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.550
produce a current and this is
why this happens.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.496
Once again, I want you to think
about the following question -

00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:26.297
we are going to take such things
and put them in electrical

00:40:26.297 --> 00:40:27.409
circuits and so on.
 

00:40:27.409 --> 00:40:29.840
We'll draw all kinds of
circuits later on.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.396
And what I will do in all those
calculations,

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:35.478
I will say I start here,
I go around a loop and I come

00:40:35.478 --> 00:40:38.210
back and the change in voltage
should be 0.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.199
I'm going to use that principle.
 

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:46.054
But there is one flaw if you
don't think about it that says

00:40:46.054 --> 00:40:48.400
maybe I shouldn't do that.
 

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.047
You remember that you can
define a voltage only for a

00:40:52.047 --> 00:40:55.438
conservative force,
whereas you definitely have non

00:40:55.438 --> 00:40:58.239
conservative forces that work in
this problem.

00:40:58.239 --> 00:41:00.650
That's why they have a line
integral not equal to 0.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.900
And yet we apply the laws of
conservative forces,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.610
or a notion of a voltage in a
circuit.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.010
I want to explain why that's
allowed.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.909
If it never bothered you,
you can ignore this part.

00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:13.384
But it's important to
understand how we can have a

00:41:13.384 --> 00:41:16.010
notion of a voltage in the
presence of time dependent

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.018
magnetic fields.
 

00:41:17.018 --> 00:41:19.889
The line integral of E
is not 0.

00:41:19.889 --> 00:41:25.028
Once again, what happens is,
if you look at this coil,

00:41:25.028 --> 00:41:30.847
there may be an electric field
that is induced now due to the

00:41:30.847 --> 00:41:33.369
changing flux of that.
 

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:37.132
That will try to build up
charges here and take them out

00:41:37.132 --> 00:41:38.090
of this end.
 

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.344
After a while,
these guys will say

00:41:39.344 --> 00:41:41.360
"Enough"
and they'll start fighting you,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.210
till they set up an
electrostatic field,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.722
a Coulomb field,
inside the wire that cancels

00:41:48.722 --> 00:41:49.440
this.
 

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.003
You understand,
the integral of this electric

00:41:52.003 --> 00:41:55.442
field from top to bottom will
numerically equal the integral

00:41:55.442 --> 00:41:58.590
of the induced electric field
from bottom to top,

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.070
because at every point they're
equal in magnitude.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:07.320
Because you cannot have a
non-zero field inside a wire.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.989
So the two fields have to be
canceled.

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:13.610
But this electrostatic field,
built by these charges,

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.396
is a conservative field,
so if it does any work going

00:42:16.396 --> 00:42:19.976
this way,
it will also do work going that

00:42:19.976 --> 00:42:20.449
way.
 

00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:22.909
Therefore if you don't open the
black box,

00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:26.688
you don't know what's inside,
if you just took the two wires

00:42:26.688 --> 00:42:29.726
coming out of it,
the static field coming from

00:42:29.726 --> 00:42:33.179
this will be able to do work
going from to - terminal.

00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:37.097
And if you put a resistor on
its path, it will deliver some

00:42:37.097 --> 00:42:38.179
energy to you.
 

00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:40.324
The trick is,
yes, there are changing

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:43.003
magnetic fields,
but they're hidden inside the

00:42:43.003 --> 00:42:43.539
coil.
 

00:42:43.539 --> 00:42:46.168
In the region outside the coil,
we don't have to worry about

00:42:46.168 --> 00:42:49.543
the changing magnetic field,
where an electric potential can

00:42:49.543 --> 00:42:52.760
be defined as the integral of
the electric field.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.099
The electric field outside is
entirely electrostatic.

00:42:56.099 --> 00:43:01.050
Electric field inside is a
combination of electrostatic and

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.440
induced one, which cancel.
 

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.873
Once current begins to flow,
you may worry that these

00:43:05.873 --> 00:43:06.949
charges will go away.
 

00:43:06.949 --> 00:43:11.268
There'll always be some
electric charges making sure

00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:15.590
that the field inside the coil
continues to be 0.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.809
Again, there's one abuse of
terminology here,

00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:20.751
because I'm saying
electrostatic,

00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:24.456
and yet this is a problem where
the electric field you need is

00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:27.625
actually changing with time,
because the rate of change of

00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:30.106
flux is changing with time,
induced electric field is

00:43:30.106 --> 00:43:31.159
changing with time.
 

00:43:31.159 --> 00:43:34.704
The compensating electrostatic
field is also changing with

00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:35.139
time.
 

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:38.231
So you really should not use
the laws of Coulomb for this

00:43:38.231 --> 00:43:39.844
problem,
but it turns out,

00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:43.217
even though Coulomb's law is
valid only strictly for fixed

00:43:43.217 --> 00:43:46.317
electric charges,
as long as the velocities

00:43:46.317 --> 00:43:50.021
required is not too big,
you can continue to use

00:43:50.021 --> 00:43:53.409
Coulomb's notion of an
electrostatic force.

00:43:53.409 --> 00:43:56.173
Basic question is,
you're telling the charges to

00:43:56.173 --> 00:43:58.409
constantly rearrange back and
forth.

00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:00.268
First you want this terminal to
be .

00:44:00.268 --> 00:44:02.030
A short time later,
you may want that to be .

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.260
How quickly can they rearrange?
 

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.373
So that's connected to
something called plasma

00:44:07.373 --> 00:44:08.829
frequency of these materials.
 

00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:10.896
And unless the frequencies are
like a trillion,

00:44:10.896 --> 00:44:12.469
you don't have to worry about
it.

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:15.650
But any normal problem,
like 50 cycles per second,

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.090
the charges will be able to
keep up with this changing

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:19.739
field.
 

00:44:19.739 --> 00:44:22.670
In other words,
can the charges go to the edge

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.577
of a conductor and screen any
internal field you're trying to

00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:27.360
produce?
 

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.260
If it's a static field,
they will kill it,

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.809
because you're giving them all
the time in the world.

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:34.630
But if you keep changing your
mind, one minute the external

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.061
field goes this way,
so the charges in the metal go

00:44:37.061 --> 00:44:38.230
that way to kill it.
 

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.250
Suddenly you reverse it,they've
got to go this way.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.119
So how quickly can they do this
dance?

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:44.210
There's a limit to how quickly
they can do it.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.362
But that's a very,
very high frequency,

00:44:46.362 --> 00:44:48.630
so you don't have to worry
about that.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:58.389
Now we saw that the emf in the
second coil = the flux in the

00:44:58.389 --> 00:45:04.510
second coil divided by
d/dt.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.349
Now you've got to be a little
careful about flux.

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:13.356
Normally, the flux due to the
magnetic field is defined as the

00:45:13.356 --> 00:45:17.789
integral of
B⋅dA.

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:19.739
But if you've got a coil made
up of two loops,

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:21.650
for example,
and there's a magnetic flux

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.304
going through them,
then the emf is not simply the

00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:26.880
rate of change of the flux
through one of them,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.327
but you've got to double it,
because it's like two batteries

00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.030
in series.
 

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.023
An emf is running round and
round and round,

00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:39.481
so really, this is
N_2 times the

00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:43.940
rate of change of the magnetic
flux to that.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.949
So this Φ
is not simply the magnetic

00:45:46.949 --> 00:45:47.489
flux.
 

00:45:47.489 --> 00:45:50.844
It's the magnetic flux times
the number of turns the second

00:45:50.844 --> 00:45:51.250
coil.
 

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.489
That's what the real emf is.
 

00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:57.956
A real emf is really rate of
change of the flux linking with

00:45:57.956 --> 00:46:00.380
your whole circuit,
dt.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:06.096
That equals number of turns
times the actual magnetic flux

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.300
dt.
 

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.150
Do you follow that?
 

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.936
Emf around a single loop is the
rate of change of flux,

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.931
but if your coil loops around
twice, the end-to-end voltage

00:46:14.931 --> 00:46:16.170
will be double that.
 

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.309
If I loops around three
times,

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:19.570
it will be triple that,
assuming the same magnetic flux

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:25.184
is going through all of them,
which is the assumption I made

00:46:25.184 --> 00:46:26.039
here.
 

00:46:26.039 --> 00:46:31.545
So now you can see here that
the flux in the second coil is

00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:37.052
due to the current in the first
coil and the coefficient of

00:46:37.052 --> 00:46:41.989
proportionality is called the
mutual inductance.

00:46:41.989 --> 00:46:47.182
So mutual inductance is how
much flux you can get in the

00:46:47.182 --> 00:46:51.809
second coil per unit current in
the first coil.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:59.422
Then you can write the emf in
the second coil as

00:46:59.422 --> 00:47:07.360
−M_12
dI_1/dt.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.652
M_12 is called
the mutual inductance of the

00:47:10.652 --> 00:47:13.110
first coil with respect to the
second one.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.643
It's true, but very hard to
prove that M_12

00:47:15.643 --> 00:47:17.320
is the same as
M_21.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.099
Not at all obvious that if you
drove a current in the first

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:24.284
coil,
it's going to have a magnetic

00:47:24.284 --> 00:47:27.121
field that's threading the
second coil and you can show

00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:30.485
that the flux per current in the
first coil due to the current in

00:47:30.485 --> 00:47:34.769
the second,
it's given by the same number.

00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.250
M_12--yes?
 

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.659
Student:  How did the
number of turns go away?

00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:40.510
Prof: Where did it go
away?

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.280
In this one you mean?
 

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.579
That's all included in the
definition of M.

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:48.206
I'm going to now calculate
M so you will see the

00:47:48.206 --> 00:47:49.570
number of turns coming in.
 

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.449
So let's do the calculation of
M for a simple problem.

00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:57.739
Here's one solenoid.
 

00:47:57.739 --> 00:48:00.480
It's got N_1
turns.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.559
And there's another guy.
 

00:48:01.559 --> 00:48:04.317
I'm just going to show you one
turn of it, but it can have

00:48:04.317 --> 00:48:05.719
N_2 turns.
 

00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:09.809
And the flux is going through
this.

00:48:09.809 --> 00:48:12.650
Now you remember that the
magnetic field due to any

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:14.923
solenoid is
μ_0 times

00:48:14.923 --> 00:48:20.931
n,
where n is the number of

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:27.320
turns per unit length times
I.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:35.427
Therefore the magnetic field in
this solenoid =

00:48:35.427 --> 00:48:41.068
μ_0
n_2

00:48:41.068 --> 00:48:49.530
I_2--I'm sorry
about that one.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:52.119
This is the first wire of the
first coil.

00:48:52.119 --> 00:49:00.139
It's n_1I
_1.

00:49:00.139 --> 00:49:05.994
And the flux of the magnetic
field is μ_0n

00:49:05.994 --> 00:49:12.056
_1I_1
times the cross sectional area

00:49:12.056 --> 00:49:13.699
of the coil.
 

00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:16.815
Now the flux linking with the
second one =

00:49:16.815 --> 00:49:20.920
μ_0n
_1I_1--

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.954
sorry, n_1AN
_2 times

00:49:24.954 --> 00:49:26.929
I_1.
 

00:49:26.929 --> 00:49:30.860
You see that?
 

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.596
So the first coil has some
wrapping density of wires,

00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:37.829
n_1 turns per
unit length.

00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:40.266
I've shown you long back from
Ampere's law,

00:49:40.266 --> 00:49:43.226
the magnetic field that
produced this has that flux,

00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:44.619
that B value.
 

00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:48.088
The integral of the field,
which is the magnetic flux,

00:49:48.088 --> 00:49:49.789
is just area times that.
 

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:54.264
But the linking with the second
coil is that flux times the

00:49:54.264 --> 00:49:57.119
number of turns in the second
coil.

00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:00.512
That by definition = the mutual
inductance

00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:05.641
M_21I_1
(I'm not going to call it 21

00:50:05.641 --> 00:50:06.469
or 12.
 

00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:13.155
It's independent of the order)
= μ_0n

00:50:13.155 --> 00:50:17.400
_1N_2A.
 

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.510
That's the mutual inductance.
 

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.543
So if I give you two closed
loops and I say,

00:50:23.543 --> 00:50:25.342
"Find the mutual
inductance,"

00:50:25.342 --> 00:50:27.139
here's what you're supposed to
do.

00:50:27.139 --> 00:50:31.106
Drive a current in the first
one and produce some flux lines,

00:50:31.106 --> 00:50:32.230
magnetic lines.
 

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.760
Some of them will penetrate the
second one.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.061
You count how many penetrate
the second one,

00:50:37.061 --> 00:50:39.949
multiplied by the number of
turns, if they exist in the

00:50:39.949 --> 00:50:42.679
second one, divide by the
current producing it.

00:50:42.679 --> 00:50:46.268
That's the mutual inductance.
 

00:50:46.268 --> 00:50:53.250
So inductance is measured in
henries, another thing for you.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:51:02.923
And usually you may find
millihenries or microhenries for

00:51:02.923 --> 00:51:05.170
common use.
 

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:08.619
Notice a very interesting
result.

00:51:08.619 --> 00:51:11.650
The flux is going through both
coils, you understand that?

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.179
The same flux is going through
both coils.

00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:16.010
Maybe you're happier if I drew
the coil like this.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:18.019
Here's a doughnut coil, right?
 

00:51:18.019 --> 00:51:18.960
You bring the wire here.
 

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.530
I told you how you can wrap it
around many times.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.434
Then the other coil,
the secondary coil,

00:51:24.434 --> 00:51:27.639
is also wrapped around the same
doughnut.

00:51:27.639 --> 00:51:31.456
It must be clear to you that
the magnetic field is going

00:51:31.456 --> 00:51:33.260
through all these coils.
 

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.996
The emf on the first one is
proportional to the number of

00:51:36.996 --> 00:51:41.132
turns on the first one times the
rate of change of the magnetic

00:51:41.132 --> 00:51:41.800
field.
 

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.927
The emf on the second one is
N_2 times

00:51:44.927 --> 00:51:48.000
dΦ
_B/dt.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.614
Therefore
E_1/E_2

00:51:52.614 --> 00:51:57.820
= N_1/N
_2.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.929
The same flux is going around
the doughnut.

00:52:00.929 --> 00:52:02.538
One guy has N_1
turns around it,

00:52:02.538 --> 00:52:04.179
other has N_2
turns around it.

00:52:04.179 --> 00:52:06.458
Emf, you remember,
is not simply rate of change of

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:07.250
magnetic flux..
 

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.639
It's that multiplied by the
number of turns.

00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:11.210
They both have the same flux
going through them,

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.512
but this has
N_1 turns,

00:52:12.512 --> 00:52:13.849
this has N_2
turns.

00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:16.579
You can see this ratio.
 

00:52:16.579 --> 00:52:18.670
That's a very powerful result.
 

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:22.599
You know what this gadget is
called?

00:52:22.599 --> 00:52:25.998
It's a transformer,
because you put in one voltage

00:52:25.998 --> 00:52:28.079
and you get another voltage.
 

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:31.014
You can have a step up
transformer or a step down

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:31.869
transformer.
 

00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:34.800
If you drive a current from
here, and you pick it up here,

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.835
that's a step down transformer,
because you're going down in

00:52:37.835 --> 00:52:39.070
the number of turns.
 

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:42.675
If you connect your power
supply to this one and you pull

00:52:42.675 --> 00:52:45.829
it out of that one,
it's a step up transformer.

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:49.052
So you can step up or step
down, but you can only do it for

00:52:49.052 --> 00:52:49.329
AC.
 

00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:52.559
You cannot do it for DC,
at least, not in any simple

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:52.940
way.
 

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:58.409
You need the changing thing to
do a transformer.

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:02.809
But I don't have the time or
techniques to convince you,

00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:07.530
in spite of the ratio of emfs,
you don't gain or lose energy

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.130
by transformers.
 

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.487
In other words,
this is not a device for

00:53:11.487 --> 00:53:12.880
manufacturing energy.
 

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.246
You will find out that if you
connect a load here and it's

00:53:17.246 --> 00:53:20.541
drawing some power,
the same power has to be

00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:22.610
provided by the source.
 

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.469
So it's not a way to
manufacture energy.

00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:25.579
It's like a lever.
 

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:29.929
You have a long thing and
you're trying to lift some

00:53:29.929 --> 00:53:34.364
object here, and you're trying
to life with--I got it

00:53:34.364 --> 00:53:35.559
backwards.
 

00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:38.867
So this is a huge object,
a tiny object,

00:53:38.867 --> 00:53:40.820
you can balance them.
 

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.565
By varying the distance,
you can have a tiny guy lifting

00:53:44.565 --> 00:53:47.969
a big one in the inverse ratio
of the distances.

00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:49.989
But you don't get any free
mileage out of this,

00:53:49.989 --> 00:53:52.539
because if you look at the work
done by similar triangles,

00:53:52.539 --> 00:53:56.130
this will have to move a lot
that will have to move a little.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.213
So the work done is the same,
but doesn't mean it's useless,

00:53:59.213 --> 00:54:02.086
because this is the only way
you can lift something very

00:54:02.086 --> 00:54:02.610
heavy.
 

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.335
Likewise in a transformer,
you may not have the ability to

00:54:06.335 --> 00:54:09.014
give 5,000 volts,
starting with 200 volts,

00:54:09.014 --> 00:54:11.889
but you can if you use this
transformer.

00:54:11.889 --> 00:54:13.789
Quite often you want to step it
down.

00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:17.809
In all the gadgets you use in
your house, you start with 110

00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:20.943
volts, you want to step it down
to some number,

00:54:20.943 --> 00:54:23.599
so you use a step down
transformer.

00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:31.869
All right, so that's the stuff
on inductance.

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:35.849
Now we are going to come--this
part is really a curiosity.

00:54:35.849 --> 00:54:39.217
I'm not going to use it very
much, the notion of mutual

00:54:39.217 --> 00:54:40.030
inductance.
 

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:44.007
Mutual inductance is one coil
trying to generate a voltage in

00:54:44.007 --> 00:54:46.860
a second coil,
because they share a flux.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.619
And when it's changing one of
them, it's also changing the

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:50.199
other one.
 

00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:52.369
They don't have to be really
coaxial.

00:54:52.369 --> 00:54:55.905
You can put a second loop way
over here, and maybe some other

00:54:55.905 --> 00:54:58.500
extra flux coming out is
penetrating this.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.635
That's the mutual inductance
between this guy and that guy

00:55:01.635 --> 00:55:02.018
also.
 

00:55:02.018 --> 00:55:06.360
Any time the flux of one coil
can go through another one,

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.773
you have a mutual inductance,
because if you change the

00:55:08.773 --> 00:55:11.023
current in the first coil,
you're going to generate a

00:55:11.023 --> 00:55:12.050
voltage in the second coil.
 

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:16.639
That's why you need to know
that proportionality.

00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:20.574
All right, so now we are going
to do the most important circuit

00:55:20.574 --> 00:55:24.130
element, which is an inductor,
and it looks like this.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.409
That's a coil of wire.
 

00:55:26.409 --> 00:55:28.030
Say some current is coming in
like this.

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:33.489
It's wrapped around some
solenoid, in the form of a

00:55:33.489 --> 00:55:34.690
solenoid.
 

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.817
This wire is a perfect
conductor, therefore it takes no

00:55:38.817 --> 00:55:42.409
voltage at all to drive a
current through it.

00:55:42.409 --> 00:55:46.590
You put a battery there and it
just burns immediately.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:52.360
But if you put a time dependent
current you will need a voltage,

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.532
because a time dependent
current will produce a time

00:55:55.532 --> 00:55:57.960
dependent magnetic flux through
this.

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.550
So let us say the current was
originally 0.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:04.407
You're trying to increase it
and produce a magnetic flux

00:56:04.407 --> 00:56:04.900
here.
 

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:10.030
Then an emf would be generated
that opposes it.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:11.789
And we can ask,
how much is the emf?

00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:17.690
The emf is the rate of change
of flux to that coil,

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:22.172
and I'm going to assume that
the flux through that coil = the

00:56:22.172 --> 00:56:26.208
current in the very same coil
time a number called self

00:56:26.208 --> 00:56:27.329
inductance.
 

00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:31.760
The self inductance is how much
flux do you produce by a current

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.518
going through yourself?
 

00:56:33.518 --> 00:56:36.130
Not on another coil,
on yourself.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:39.684
Every coil, when it carries
current, will have some flux

00:56:39.684 --> 00:56:41.429
threading through itself.
 

00:56:41.429 --> 00:56:44.039
So that ratio is called the
self inductance,

00:56:44.039 --> 00:56:45.679
also measured in henries.
 

00:56:45.679 --> 00:56:51.340
So this becomes
−LdI/dt.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.289
You will calculate L in
a moment,

00:56:53.289 --> 00:56:57.005
but I'm just telling you that
as long as dI/dt is not

00:56:57.005 --> 00:56:59.512
0,
you will have to oppose that

00:56:59.512 --> 00:57:03.268
back emf with a voltage from
some other supply.

00:57:03.268 --> 00:57:06.530
So in this example,
the current is going like this.

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:09.460
Let us say it's trying to
increase.

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:13.802
If it is trying to increase,
then the back emf will be set

00:57:13.802 --> 00:57:17.460
up, an electro emf will be set
up to fight it.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.954
It will try to push charges
that way, from this terminal to

00:57:20.954 --> 00:57:21.920
that terminal.
 

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.639
It will pile up charges there.
 

00:57:23.639 --> 00:57:27.489
But if you don't look under the
hood and just went outside,

00:57:27.489 --> 00:57:30.483
you'll have charges and -
charges and an electrostatic

00:57:30.483 --> 00:57:33.309
field here will be able to push
them like this,

00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:36.110
maybe through a circuit.
 

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.659
So it's the same story again
and again.

00:57:37.659 --> 00:57:39.889
There is no net field inside
the coil.

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:43.179
The electromotive force is
canceled by a Coulomb force.

00:57:43.179 --> 00:57:45.601
But the Coulomb force,
if it has a line integral here,

00:57:45.601 --> 00:57:47.336
will have the same line
integral there,

00:57:47.336 --> 00:57:49.210
because it's independent of the
path.

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.976
So if you don't look inside,
you will just find there is

00:57:51.976 --> 00:57:54.340
some field which has lines from
here to here.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.530
That's the voltage.
 

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.619
But it will be a voltage drop,
so that if you want another

00:57:59.619 --> 00:58:02.059
convention for the voltage,
it's like this.

00:58:02.059 --> 00:58:05.891
If the current is going this
way and it's increasing in this

00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:09.789
direction, this will be and that
will be - at the instant.

00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:12.579
Just like a resistor,
it flows downhill,

00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:14.942
this will also flow downhill,
meaning this is higher than

00:58:14.942 --> 00:58:18.447
this,
provided the current is trying

00:58:18.447 --> 00:58:23.199
to increase in the direction of
the current.

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:27.010
So we can have the following
very simple circuit.

00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:28.768
We have a battery here.
 

00:58:28.768 --> 00:58:34.480
You've got a resistor there and
we have an inductor there.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.804
This is some voltage V,
this is R,

00:58:39.804 --> 00:58:43.429
this is some L henries.
 

00:58:43.429 --> 00:58:46.869
So let us write a circuit
equation and here is where I

00:58:46.869 --> 00:58:50.699
spend an inordinate amount of
time justifying what I'm about

00:58:50.699 --> 00:58:51.349
to do.
 

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:53.489
I say start here.
 

00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:57.878
There's going to be a voltage
defined everywhere except inside

00:58:57.878 --> 00:58:59.030
the black box.
 

00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.690
You understand?
 

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:02.134
You cannot define a voltage
inside the black box where

00:59:02.134 --> 00:59:03.885
there's an inductor,
because there is a

00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:05.869
non-conservative electric field
inside.

00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:07.429
But we promise not to go there.
 

00:59:07.429 --> 00:59:09.342
Then from here to here,
you go up by

00:59:09.342 --> 00:59:10.599
V_0.
 

00:59:10.599 --> 00:59:13.469
Then here, current flows
downhill,

00:59:13.469 --> 00:59:16.909
so you drop RI and here,
if this is the sense of the

00:59:16.909 --> 00:59:20.938
current and it's increasing,
your loop will go from there to

00:59:20.938 --> 00:59:24.469
there and it will jump this and
come to this end.

00:59:24.469 --> 00:59:28.539
The drop from here to here is
LdI/dt,

00:59:28.539 --> 00:59:32.420
and the whole thing should add
up to 0.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.143
So here's a one word summary
for those of you who have heard

00:59:36.143 --> 00:59:39.929
enough - we learned the notion
of voltage can be defined,

00:59:39.929 --> 00:59:44.309
or a potential,
only in a conservative problem.

00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:47.704
But a changing magnetic field
inductor definitely is producing

00:59:47.704 --> 00:59:49.710
a field which is not
conservative.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:52.335
So if you go deep into the
coil, you will have problems

00:59:52.335 --> 00:59:53.260
defining voltage.
 

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.994
But if you come outside the
coil, I've tried to show you

00:59:55.994 --> 00:59:58.702
over and over again,
all it looks like is there is a

00:59:58.702 --> 01:00:00.920
voltage difference between the
two plates,

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.172
the two terminals,
and that value is

01:00:04.172 --> 01:00:05.659
LdI/dt.
 

01:00:05.659 --> 01:00:07.190
So when you do your circuit
equation,

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.768
you go from there,
all the way back here,

01:00:08.768 --> 01:00:15.202
you skip these funny elements,
and around them you still have

01:00:15.202 --> 01:00:17.989
the notion of a voltage.
 

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:25.418
So this is the equation to
solve at any time for an

01:00:25.418 --> 01:00:28.389
LR circuit.
 

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:31.376
Now prior to this,
let me give you a very

01:00:31.376 --> 01:00:34.809
interesting result,
which we will use a lot.

01:00:34.809 --> 01:00:37.954
If you take an inductor which
had current I = 0 and you

01:00:37.954 --> 01:00:40.842
managed to drive a current
through it and slowly built up

01:00:40.842 --> 01:00:43.916
the current,
it's got some other value I at

01:00:43.916 --> 01:00:48.775
the end,
what was the work done to do

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:49.659
that?
 

01:00:49.659 --> 01:00:52.492
I will now show you that when
you drive a current through an

01:00:52.492 --> 01:00:54.641
inductor,
you are doing some work,

01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:57.590
because when you start driving
the current,

01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:00.670
it's opposing you with a
voltage LdI/dt,

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.572
and you're ramming it down
that, up in spite of that

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:06.163
opposition,
so that the work you do,

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.985
the power,
is I times

01:01:08.985 --> 01:01:11.929
LdI/dt,
which is,

01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:17.590
if you like the rate of change
of energy.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:24.342
But I times LdI/dt is
d/dt of ½

01:01:24.342 --> 01:01:26.989
IL squared.
 

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:36.260
I'm sorry, LI squared.
 

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.873
You see that from the rules of
calculus, the derivative of this

01:01:39.873 --> 01:01:42.090
guy is LI times
dI/dt.

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:47.626
Therefore the integral of the
power is simply

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:53.543
½LI^(2),
assuming you started at 0

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:58.199
current, started at I =
0.

01:01:58.199 --> 01:02:01.925
So it takes some energy to
build up a current in the

01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:02.730
inductor.
 

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.639
That's the point.
 

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:08.010
Just like it takes some energy
to charge up a capacitor.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:12.389
I showed you when you charge up
a capacitor, here's a capacitor.

01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:15.181
It's got some charges,
, -, you want to charge it even

01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:18.079
more, you're going to ram more
positive charges and more

01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:19.449
negative charges here.
 

01:02:19.449 --> 01:02:22.297
You fight it harder and the
total work done is

01:02:22.297 --> 01:02:23.880
q^(2)/2C.
 

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.248
Similarly, when you have an
inductor and you're trying to

01:02:26.248 --> 01:02:28.869
increase the current through it
from 0 to some final value,

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:31.840
this is the amount of work done
by you.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.170
That energy is stored in the
inductor.

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:39.184
I want to look a little bit
about inductors,

01:02:39.184 --> 01:02:41.780
but first let's calculate
L.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.789
So let's calculate L for
a simple solenoid.

01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:48.710
Here is my solenoid.
 

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:54.164
Remember, L is defined
as the flux linkage divided by

01:02:54.164 --> 01:02:55.460
the current.
 

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.666
It's going to be a one line
calculation so it's going to be

01:02:58.666 --> 01:02:59.329
very easy.
 

01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:03.442
The magnetic field =
μ_0 little

01:03:03.442 --> 01:03:04.590
nI.
 

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.114
Little n you remember,
always is the number of turns

01:03:08.114 --> 01:03:09.360
per unit length.
 

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.675
The flux of the magnetic field
is μ_0 nI

01:03:14.675 --> 01:03:17.739
times the area of cross section.
 

01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:23.079
That's the total magnetic flux.
 

01:03:23.079 --> 01:03:26.688
But the flux linkage is
μ_0 little n

01:03:26.688 --> 01:03:31.123
IA times big N,
because every loop of the coil

01:03:31.123 --> 01:03:33.230
links with its own flux.
 

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:42.146
But that is by definition
LI. So you can see that

01:03:42.146 --> 01:03:50.739
L = μ_0
little n big NA.

01:03:50.739 --> 01:03:54.599
That's the self inductance of
the coil.

01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:56.360
What does this mean?
 

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.451
If this = 5 henries,
it means that if you shove 1

01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:07.284
ampere through this guy,
a flux equal to 5 tesla squared

01:04:07.284 --> 01:04:11.739
meters will be linked to that
circuit.

01:04:11.739 --> 01:04:16.530
So the thing I want to do now
is to equate this energy,

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:21.056
½ LI^(2),
to the magnetic field inside

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.210
the coil.
 

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:25.000
So you've got 1 over 2.
 

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.960
L is μ_0
little n,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.760
big NAI^(2).
 

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.744
So let me rewrite that as
½

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:47.869
μ_0n^(2)
times lA times

01:04:47.869 --> 01:04:49.559
I^(2).
 

01:04:49.559 --> 01:04:50.945
In other words,
I've written,

01:04:50.945 --> 01:04:53.818
using this formula to write
little n as big N

01:04:53.818 --> 01:04:54.710
over l.
 

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:58.204
times A,
is the volume in which there's

01:04:58.204 --> 01:04:59.679
a magnetic field.
 

01:04:59.679 --> 01:05:04.902
So this looks like 1 over
2μ_0 times

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:11.106
μ_0nI whole
squared, times l

01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:13.610
times A.
 

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.639
But who is
μ_0nI.

01:05:15.639 --> 01:05:18.989
μ_0nI is
the magnetic field.

01:05:18.989 --> 01:05:25.380
So this looks like
B^(2)/2μ_0

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.039
times the volume of the
solenoid.

01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:33.918
From that we learn that when
you have a magnetic field,

01:05:33.918 --> 01:05:37.512
there's an energy of
B^(2)/2μ_0

01:05:37.512 --> 01:05:38.590
per volume.
 

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:42.983
So the energy density of the
magnetic field =

01:05:42.983 --> 01:05:46.280
B^(2)/2μ_0.
 

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.407
Let me remind you the electric
field energy,

01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:52.027
energy density for electric
field, is

01:05:52.027 --> 01:05:55.010
ε_0/2
E^(2).

01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:56.929
You might remember that formula.
 

01:05:56.929 --> 01:05:58.590
So they are very similar
formulas,

01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:02.034
except μ_0,
which is normally upstairs in

01:06:02.034 --> 01:06:04.086
every formula,
comes downstairs here,

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:06.672
and ε_0 which
is always downstairs in every

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:16.079
formula,
comes upstairs here.

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:20.780
So let me summarize what you
should remember from all of

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.380
this.
 

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:27.853
When you have a circuit element
called an inductor,

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:36.010
it's just a coil of wire that's
wrapped around some solenoid.

01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.717
And when you change the current
through the inductor,

01:06:38.717 --> 01:06:40.019
it's going to fight it.
 

01:06:40.019 --> 01:06:41.360
It's not like a resistor.
 

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.340
A resistor fights any current.
 

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.574
An inductor fights only a
change in current,

01:06:47.574 --> 01:06:51.612
so that's all summarized in
this equation,

01:06:51.612 --> 01:06:55.750
the voltage = LdI/dt
RI.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.360
This is the circuit we're going
to look at.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.440
Maybe a switch is open like
that.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.317
There's R,
that's L,

01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:08.630
that's a switch,
that's the voltage.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:13.449
When you close the switch,
you've got to ask yourself,

01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:16.449
what's the current going to be?
 

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:22.329
What will be the current
infinitesimally after the switch

01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:23.590
is closed?
 

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.139
Yes?
 

01:07:25.139 --> 01:07:29.172
Suppose it was not 0,
but .2 amps,

01:07:29.172 --> 01:07:31.739
what's the problem?
 

01:07:31.739 --> 01:07:35.179
After all, you closed the
circuit.

01:07:35.179 --> 01:07:36.000
Yes?
 

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.099
Student:  You have
energy stored in the inductor

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:41.768
without ___________.
 

01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:43.161
Prof: Yeah,
first of all,

01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:45.317
if you had .2 amps,
you'll have ½LI^(2)

01:07:45.317 --> 01:07:47.469
and you can ask,
"Who had the time to do

01:07:47.469 --> 01:07:47.909
that?"
 

01:07:47.909 --> 01:07:49.460
Nobody.
 

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.045
More importantly,
if LdI/dt is the voltage

01:07:53.045 --> 01:07:57.077
across this, it will become
infinite if dI/dt is

01:07:57.077 --> 01:07:58.050
infinite.
 

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:01.655
A current that jumps from 0 to
something in no time,

01:08:01.655 --> 01:08:03.989
that's got infinite derivative.
 

01:08:03.989 --> 01:08:06.846
So any quantity whose
derivative is bounded cannot

01:08:06.846 --> 01:08:09.119
jump in its value just from
calculus.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:11.789
So the current in the inductor
will never jump.

01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:16.092
Likewise if you have a
capacitor, with some charge on

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:17.860
it,
and you close the circuit,

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.817
the charge on the capacitor
initially was

01:08:19.817 --> 01:08:21.738
Q_0,
will remain

01:08:21.738 --> 01:08:25.488
Q_0 one
femto-second after you close it,

01:08:25.488 --> 01:08:28.051
because charge on it,
the rate of change of the

01:08:28.051 --> 01:08:29.750
charge,
is a current.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.078
The current is finite in any
real problem.

01:08:33.078 --> 01:08:37.025
So capacitors cannot abruptly
change the charge they have,

01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:41.319
and inductors cannot abruptly
change the current they carry.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.470
If you want,
they are connected to energy.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:46.090
The energy in the capacitor is
Q^(2)/2C,

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:47.760
therefore if q changes
abruptly,

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.529
the energy changes by a finite
amount in infinitesimal time.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:54.670
Nobody can deliver that energy
or take out energy at that rate.

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:57.390
Similarly for the inductor.
 

01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:01.359
So I'll tell you what's in
store on Wednesday.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:05.355
We're going to come back and
look at this LR circuits and

01:09:05.355 --> 01:09:08.710
look at LC circuits and look at
LCR circuits.

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:11.520
That's the kind of stuff I
think you've all done before in

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.600
high school,
but I think still have to do

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.519
that, because that's the kind of
stuff that may be more useful

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:18.960
than many of the other things
I'm talking about.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.189
But it won't be in the greatest
depth.

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.199
I just want to hit the high
points.

01:09:23.199 --> 01:09:28.000

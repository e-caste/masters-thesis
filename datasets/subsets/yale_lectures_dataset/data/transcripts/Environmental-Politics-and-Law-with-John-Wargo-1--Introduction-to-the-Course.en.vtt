00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.070
Prof: This course has a
long history.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.416
And the purpose is really to
wonder with you about the

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:13.270
potential effectiveness of
environmental law.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.184
And I really want you to
imagine that we have no

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.850
environmental law.
 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.116
By the end of the course,
I may ask you on a final exam

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:25.322
to design a new system of
environmental law that would

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:28.952
protect us against the problems
that I'm going to run through

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:29.860
with you.
 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.499
This is an unusual course in
that most law courses do not go

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.510
through case histories the way
that we will here.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.374
So that we will be reviewing
perhaps twelve or fourteen

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.810
different case histories of
specific problems.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.960
We'll be taking a look at the
statutes that evolved in an

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.930
attempt to manage those
problems.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.767
And I will give you my
impressions about how

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:57.990
effectiveness might be judged,
how efficiency might be judged.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.929
And also really answer the
basic question,

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.840
which is what's worked,
what has not,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.241
and why, as a way of thinking
about how we're going to respond

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:11.560
to a very new world in which you
will face,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.519
your children will face,
your grandkids will face

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.057
approximately ten to twelve
billion people creating more

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:23.470
demand on resources,
more pollution,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.290
rising rates of consumption,
rising rates of waste.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.650
How are we going to manage
these types of problems?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.849
That's really the essential
purpose of the course.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.732
You'll see on the syllabus that
I want to run through quickly

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:41.614
with you that today I'll give
you an overview of the material

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:44.849
that we'll cover over the next
several months.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.041
On Thursday,
we'll review principles and

00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.581
strategies in environmental law
and I'll give you a quick Cook's

00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.110
tour of a variety of different
statutes,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.706
as well as the decision
standards that are embedded in

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:57.860
those statutes.
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.453
Then we will take a look over
several weeks at the problem of

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.909
national security and the
environment,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.676
and really what happens when
the military spends trillions of

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:16.887
dollars per year in the world,
what happens to environmental

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:17.658
quality?
 

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:20.895
The public sector has not been
the target of twentieth century

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.570
environmental law,
but it has been a very

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.615
important force in shaping the
environment that we now are

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:28.680
coping with.
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.908
We'll look at nuclear
experimentation.

00:02:30.908 --> 00:02:35.494
And I've come to believe that
the atmospheric weapons testing

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:40.079
program of the 1940s and 1950s
really demonstrates one of the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.970
greatest success stories that we
have in environmental law,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.471
following the recognition that
the radionuclides that were

00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.710
created and blown into the
atmosphere,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.690
worked their way into the
stratosphere,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.970
they encircled the globe.
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.233
And when they intersected rain
clouds, they would fall to

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:00.699
earth.
 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.931
They contaminated the soil,
they contaminated the water

00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:04.590
supplies.
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.340
They contaminated also food
supplies, agricultural crops,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.921
and made their way to the
dinner tables of everybody on

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.110
the earth.
 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.408
The radionuclides eventually
became embedded in human tissue.

00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:22.544
Depending on the nuclide,
it would vary between bone or

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:26.681
fat tissue, perhaps the liver,
and pose very well-known

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:27.598
threats.
 

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:30.395
So we'll review that story,
because there are really

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.720
fundamental lessons of ecology,
fundamental lessons of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.038
environmental health that we've
really forgotten.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:40.762
We've forgotten as we've
attempted to manage air,

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.787
water, food,
as well as consumer product

00:03:43.787 --> 00:03:46.580
safety or large tracts of lands.
 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.477
So why have these lessons that
were very clear by 1963,

00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:53.220
why have we forgotten those
lessons?

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.508
That is the purpose of that
segment.

00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:57.430
And for each of these case
histories,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.641
I'll be reviewing the specific
statutes that applied at the

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:05.926
time and talk about how they
evolved and give you a sense of

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:10.139
how you would evaluate whether
or not they've worked,

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.340
how effective they were.
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.188
We'll take a look too at
preparation for warfare.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:18.209
It's not only the waging of war
that creates great environmental

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.709
destruction;
it's also the preparation for

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.738
warfare, the training,
the production of weapons,

00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:25.569
the enrichment of uranium.
 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:29.786
So that if you look at the 25
to 30,000 different military

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:34.300
bases and installations around
the world, you'll see extremely

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.149
severe contamination.
 

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.053
So thinking about how that
should be managed,

00:04:39.053 --> 00:04:42.550
how it might be prevented,
will also be the subject of

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.850
several lectures,
as well as site restoration.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.226
So we'll be looking at
predominately public sector

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.410
issues in this first segment of
the course.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.613
And then we'll take a look at
the private sector,

00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:54.908
which has been the target of
most twentieth century

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:55.920
environmental law.
 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.158
We'll take a look at global
markets and the challenge that

00:04:59.158 --> 00:05:01.088
they pose in managing chemicals.
 

00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:05.613
And the management of chemicals
is a very tricky business in

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:09.831
that it demands a high degree of
sensitivity about where

00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:13.360
chemicals are released to the
environment.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.459
Where do they go?
 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:15.269
How do they move?
 

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:16.310
Are they persistent?
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.430
Where do they end up?
 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.110
And how are people exposed?
 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.194
Calculating the magnitude of
exposure is really fundamental

00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:26.110
to understanding what the risk
is.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.189
And most environmental laws are
structured to manage chemicals

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.129
based on this idea of risk.
 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.422
So to understand the risk and
to manage it,

00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:37.423
you have to understand all of
these intermediate issues,

00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:39.279
such as where was it released?
 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.050
Where does it go?
 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.129
How does it get into your
environment?

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.250
And what are the likely health
effects?

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.711
And the word likely is very
important, because it implies

00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.680
that we need to be thinking
probabilistically.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.935
What's the probability of
damage occurring down the road,

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:59.269
whether or not it's ecological
or human health related?

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:03.841
So we'll be thinking about the
different forms of law that have

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:07.750
evolved to try to deal with this
kind of a problem.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.927
Some set risk-only standards,
some are risk-benefit

00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:14.867
balancing, some are cost-benefit
balancing and more utilitarian

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:16.329
in their structure.
 

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:20.762
So what is the right standard
to apply for very specific

00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:21.649
problems?
 

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:25.401
We will then take a look at a
variety of issue areas,

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.300
including what I think of as
industrial agriculture.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.930
The majority of our food is
highly processed.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.059
It is chemically dependent,
particularly on fertilizers and

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:41.259
pesticides and preservatives and
dyes of different sorts.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.430
So what does that mean?
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.562
The food packaging industry is
increasingly of interest to me

00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:47.660
in my own research.
 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.997
So I'll share with you several
ideas about how plastics make

00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:55.440
their way into your life.
 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.100
Right now, the synthetic
chemical industry is dominated

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.192
by the plastics industry;
it constitutes seventy percent

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:04.540
of the synthetic chemical
industry in the United States.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.045
And each year,
one hundred billion pounds of

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:10.370
chemicals are produced and
released to the environment.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.865
And among all plastics,
among those one hundred billion

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:16.649
pounds, only five percent are
recyclable.

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:20.920
So we are building up a waste
stream that is coming back to

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.730
haunt us.
 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.028
If I took tissue samples from
each of you,

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:28.490
probably ninety-five percent of
you would have residues

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.324
phthalates or Bisphenol A,
which are plasticizers in your

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:32.720
body.
 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.069
And scientists,
including Hugh Taylor right

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.565
here at the Yale Medical School,
is now recognizing that these

00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:41.639
are very effective chemicals at
exceptionally low doses,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.517
part per trillion doses,
in sending a signal to cells

00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:49.920
that estrogen has arrived or
another hormone has arrived.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.218
So that they are triggers of
hormonal activity in many

00:07:53.218 --> 00:07:56.269
different species of animals as
well as humans.

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:57.810
So what does this mean?
 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.009
In one way, it means that we're
conducting quite a chemical

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:06.209
experiment on ourselves,
but also on future generations.

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.910
So what should we be doing
about it?

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.500
How should we be managing the
chemical universe?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.266
This chemical universe,
by the way, in international

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:17.740
commerce includes about 80,000
different compounds at present.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.872
Two to three thousand new
chemicals are produced and

00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:23.329
released to the environment each
year.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:27.002
And they take many different
forms, pharmaceuticals,

00:08:27.002 --> 00:08:29.954
plasticizers,
different metal compounds in

00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:33.408
millions and millions of
different products.

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:37.860
So that these chemicals have no
mechanism in law,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.251
even in the United States,
to test what their effect is

00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:47.133
and what the risk might be to
either environmental quality or

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:48.759
to human health.
 

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:52.850
So what should we do about
problems like that?

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.422
We'll take a look at air
quality law, and particularly

00:08:56.422 --> 00:09:00.196
the concentration of the Clean
Air Act on really very few

00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:01.139
chemicals.
 

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:05.785
There are six chemicals that
became a target of national air

00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:08.070
quality law and regulation.
 

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.576
This is administered by the
Environmental Protection Agency,

00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:14.966
and they decide which chemicals
will appear on their radar

00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:15.620
screen.
 

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.639
They decide what monitoring
programs are necessary in order

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:22.220
to detect where they go,
how they move,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.808
how they behave in the
environment and how dangerous

00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:27.340
they are,
who might be at risk.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.610
One good example of that might
be diesel exhaust.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.928
And you may know that the older
trucks, the less efficient

00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:38.414
diesel vehicles,
tend to spew large particulate

00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:40.840
matter from their tailpipes.
 

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:47.817
And these larger particulates,
ten microns in size and larger,

00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:49.418
are visible.
 

00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:51.389
It's one of the chemical
threats that is visible.

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:54.009
It's one of the easier ones to
identify.

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:57.053
In fact, with diesel exhaust,
you cannot only see it,

00:09:57.053 --> 00:09:59.804
you can taste it,
you can feel it burning in the

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:01.210
back of your throat.
 

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.433
So most people understand when
they are exposed to diesel

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:05.009
exhaust.
 

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:09.509
Well, one of the interesting
intents of the EPA was to reduce

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:13.408
the particle size,
to reduce the larger particles.

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:17.240
And what happened when the
engines became more efficient to

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.751
accomplish that was they
produced more,

00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:21.470
but smaller particles.
 

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.720
So the finer particles,
less than one micron in size,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.423
not thinking that these finer
particles can be more deeply

00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:31.126
inhaled into the lung,
they reside there,

00:10:31.126 --> 00:10:33.820
they get stuck to the sides of
the airways,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.187
particularly in those that have
background illnesses such as

00:10:37.187 --> 00:10:40.970
asthma,
emphysema, lung cancer.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.354
So that these particles don't
get expired, so that exposure

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:47.320
becomes more persistent.
 

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.139
The danger to health is
increasing.

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:51.590
There's an interesting
correlation,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.058
and I'm not saying that it's a
causal relationship,

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:58.292
an interesting correlation
between the increasing number of

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:02.159
these finer particles with
rising rates of respiratory

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:06.318
illness in the United States and
in different parts of the

00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:08.289
industrialized world.
 

00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:11.330
So why might that be?
 

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.009
Well, let me give you one
analogy.

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:16.306
If you thought about an
aquarium and you fill that

00:11:16.306 --> 00:11:19.940
aquarium up, regardless of its
size, with softballs.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.879
And then you calculated the
surface area of those softballs.

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:28.667
And then you took the softballs
out and you filled the aquarium

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:29.950
up with, say,
peas.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.902
And you calculated the surface
area of the peas,

00:11:32.902 --> 00:11:35.730
being analogous to the finer
particle size.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.586
You'd find a many-fold increase
in the surface area of the peas

00:11:40.586 --> 00:11:43.250
than you would of the softballs.
 

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.851
And because the carbon
particles that are these core

00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:50.207
elements of particulates,
because they're sticky,

00:11:50.207 --> 00:11:53.322
they tend to lock onto a
variety of different organic

00:11:53.322 --> 00:11:56.200
compounds called volatile
organic compounds,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.470
which are also regulated by EPA.
 

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.129
So that the carbon core becomes
the vehicle for bringing a whole

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:06.308
array of different chemicals
into your lung,

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:09.120
very, very fine particles in
size.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.422
So that many times,
the absence of excellent

00:12:12.422 --> 00:12:16.798
scientific information can lead
the government into making

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:20.715
decisions that are actually not
health protective or

00:12:20.715 --> 00:12:23.250
environmentally protective.
 

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.211
So we need to be very conscious
about the importance of doing

00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:30.607
excellent science,
not just science about where

00:12:30.607 --> 00:12:33.190
chemicals move in the
environment,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.889
but their effects on human
health.

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:38.474
If you went to EPA's website
and you looked for the purpose

00:12:38.474 --> 00:12:41.070
of the Environmental Protection
Agency,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.471
the number one purpose that you
see on their website is to

00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:49.333
protect human health from
dangerous elements in the

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:50.570
environment.
 

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.529
That's kind of curious.
 

00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:54.940
Many people think of the
environment as not being that

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.450
closely associated with human
health.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.859
We'll look at food safety
issues, and we'll look at the

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:01.509
rise of the organic food
industry,

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:03.889
which I believe is a very
important success story in the

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:08.090
twentieth century,
particularly the result of the

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:13.710
Food Production Act of 1990,
although there was a delay in

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.370
adopting standards for organic
foods until the year 2000.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.663
But the organic sector in the
food market now is the largest

00:13:22.663 --> 00:13:26.519
growing of any other sector
besides bottled water,

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:29.570
if you include water in the
food industry.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.360
This is very interesting.
 

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.969
So the idea of certification,
of government-sponsored

00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:38.577
certification as potentially
creating new markets for

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:42.118
products that are health
friendly or environmentally

00:13:42.118 --> 00:13:43.158
friendly.
 

00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.863
We'll look at the strengths and
weaknesses of the certification

00:13:45.863 --> 00:13:48.280
scheme,
not just related to food,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.956
but also to paper and forest
products and a variety of other

00:13:52.956 --> 00:13:56.700
areas,
especially related to buildings.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.480
We'll take a look at the
history of tobacco regulation.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.087
And there's a special legal
paradigm that applies to

00:14:02.087 --> 00:14:02.600
tobacco.
 

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.966
But again, it's one of these
types of threats to human health

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:11.769
and environmental quality that
was really very lightly treated,

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:14.470
very lightly regulated during
the twentieth century,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.115
and only now are we seeing the
Food and Drug Administration

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:21.634
being empowered to take tighter
control over the way that

00:14:21.634 --> 00:14:23.269
products are marketed.
 

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:26.330
We'll take a look at the
advertising strategies of

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.014
tobacco companies and see a
variety of similarities to other

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:33.239
products,
such as toys or candy or

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:37.350
different kinds of foods toward
children.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:43.206
So that hooking children early
on to try to cultivate their

00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:49.470
taste toward foods that are high
in salt and sugar and fat,

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.658
there are some very interesting
similarities there between the

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.638
way the tobacco industry was
very anxious to encourage the

00:14:55.638 --> 00:14:58.200
youngest in society to try
tobacco products,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.899
knowing that exposures for very
short periods of time could

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:04.440
become addictive.
 

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.759
We'll take a look after spring
break at land use issues.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:10.873
We'll switch from chemical
problems and pollution problems

00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:12.019
to land use issues.
 

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:16.910
And we'll be particularly
interested in legal strategies

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.739
for conservation,
different approaches to set

00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:24.230
aside lands to protect
biological diversity,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.636
to protect watersheds in an
effort to improve environmental

00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:30.570
quality.
 

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.818
We'll look also at wilderness
and national park law and a

00:15:33.818 --> 00:15:36.720
variety of other statutes that
apply to the U.S.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.610
National Forest lands,
the Bureau of Land Management.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.697
And we'll also look at
conflicts between land use and

00:15:45.697 --> 00:15:50.336
development and the important
value that we hold for private

00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:53.090
property rights in our society.
 

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.365
We'll also think about urbanism
and sprawl and different

00:15:57.365 --> 00:16:01.407
smart-growth techniques to try
to control the rate of

00:16:01.407 --> 00:16:04.048
development in suburban areas.
 

00:16:04.048 --> 00:16:06.928
We'll also look at the idea of
environmental justice,

00:16:06.928 --> 00:16:11.889
which really grows from a
recognition of different groups,

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:18.224
different areas receiving or
being exposed at a higher level

00:16:18.224 --> 00:16:25.308
to either chemicals or different
kinds of environmental insults.

00:16:25.308 --> 00:16:28.907
So that we'll run through a
variety of cases where groups

00:16:28.907 --> 00:16:31.220
claim that they are more
exposed,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.687
more at risk than others,
they're bearing a

00:16:34.687 --> 00:16:38.320
disproportionate burden of harm
or threat.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.702
We'll also look at the rising
interest and rising

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:46.812
incorporation of LEED
certification into U.S.,

00:16:46.812 --> 00:16:49.370
national, and state law.
 

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.370
So buildings are certified now
to be green at different levels.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.029
The School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies building,

00:16:57.029 --> 00:16:59.200
the new Kroon building,
for example,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.139
is applying for the highest
level of LEED certification,

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:04.058
it's called Platinum.
 

00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:08.633
So we'll look at the evolution
of that certification scheme and

00:17:08.633 --> 00:17:13.132
I'll be actually quite critical
of the scheme and the way that

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:17.262
standards are being adopted by
different governments that

00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:21.318
become the foundation for the
allocation of property tax

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:25.240
breaks,
but also direct subsidies from

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.900
both the federal government and
state governments.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.156
We'll take a look then near the
end of the term at the past and

00:17:34.156 --> 00:17:38.277
future of nuclear power and the
statutes and regulations that

00:17:38.277 --> 00:17:42.199
surround nuclear power,
particularly the statutes that

00:17:42.199 --> 00:17:45.997
provided really large subsidies
when compared to subsidies

00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:48.730
allocated to renewable energy
sources.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.890
We'll take a look at a variety
of different emissions trading

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.375
schemes,
and renewable energy policies,

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:57.743
and then end the course with a
reflection across these

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.539
different cases about what we've
learned.

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:02.558
So that's the game plan.
 

00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:05.646
And I wanted to spend just a
couple minutes talking about

00:18:05.646 --> 00:18:06.858
course requirements.
 

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:10.606
The course is structured to
have a final examination worth

00:18:10.606 --> 00:18:12.578
forty percent of your grade.
 

00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:16.944
But also, there is a paper or
midterm option that would

00:18:16.944 --> 00:18:20.259
constitute fifty percent of your
grade.

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:24.271
And then a discussion section
will be held each week for fifty

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:24.930
minutes.
 

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.433
So everybody will need to sign
up for a discussion section,

00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:29.680
and that would be worth ten
percent of your grade.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.464
I'll talk more as we move
through the term about the term

00:18:33.464 --> 00:18:34.480
paper option.
 

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.087
There are four books that have
been ordered and I believe are

00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:38.630
all in.
 

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.413
There's one that was shipped
yesterday and should be in this

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:41.980
afternoon.
 

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.835
David Kessler's A Question
of Intent,

00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:48.421
which provides a really
wonderful review of the history

00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:50.680
of tobacco law and regulation.
 

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.618
Michael Pollan,
The Omnivore's Dilemma.

00:18:53.618 --> 00:18:58.363
A good part of my career has
been spent thinking about food

00:18:58.363 --> 00:19:02.207
quality and food safety,
so we'll take a look at

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.680
Pollan's work.
 

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.853
We'll read also a book that I
published just a few months ago

00:19:07.853 --> 00:19:12.233
called Green Intelligence
that will run through a variety

00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:16.058
of these cases that we'll
examine during the class.

00:19:16.058 --> 00:19:19.875
And then we will take a look at
Weinberg and Reilly's book

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:23.088
called Understanding
Environmental Law.

00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:27.740
Course themes that I intend to
draw through these cases include

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.240
those that are on the back of
page two, or the bottom of page

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.838
two.
 

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:37.000
How is law related to science
and uncertainty?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.118
What causes environmental
damage and health loss?

00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:43.500
Where should the burden of
proof of causality lie?

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.369
On the public sector or on the
private sector?

00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:47.970
On the individual?
 

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.509
So that understanding the idea
of burden of proof is a

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:55.250
fundamental aspect of
understanding environmental law.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.557
We'll also take a look at the
importance of secrecy and the

00:20:00.557 --> 00:20:04.220
control over information or
knowledge.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.828
So I think of this as being
really an analogy between the

00:20:08.828 --> 00:20:12.038
public sector and the private
sector.

00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:16.250
In the private sector,
secrecy is a very important

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.632
component in that trade secrecy
protects a company's

00:20:20.632 --> 00:20:25.357
understanding of product
ingredients or perhaps how it's

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.710
processed or produced or
shipped.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.933
Whereas classified information
in the public sector protects

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.058
sensitive information.
 

00:20:36.058 --> 00:20:38.115
In both cases,
the idea is to protect

00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:41.144
competitive advantage,
either in international affairs

00:20:41.144 --> 00:20:42.630
or in the marketplace.
 

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.529
So we'll see how that plays out
in many of these cases.

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:49.987
We'll also think about the
principle of democracy and how

00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:53.383
participation rights vary
depending upon which law we're

00:20:53.383 --> 00:20:54.308
looking at.
 

00:20:54.308 --> 00:20:57.984
And as participation rights
expand, decision-making becomes

00:20:57.984 --> 00:20:59.190
more complicated.
 

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.859
And what that means is that it
often slows down and it's harder

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:09.890
to reach a mission of improved
environmental quality.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.690
We'll look at property rights.
 

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.494
And rights in law are an
essential component,

00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:19.818
but also obligations are an
essential component.

00:21:19.818 --> 00:21:23.575
So when I think about law,
I think about how rights are

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.357
specified,
how obligations are specified,

00:21:26.357 --> 00:21:29.490
and what are the sanctions
applied for deviance,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.054
and where does the perception
of legitimacy for that law come

00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:33.470
from?
 

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.261
So we'll be asking those set of
questions for each of the laws

00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:38.318
that we review.
 

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:42.623
We'll take a look too at the
principles of equality and

00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:46.289
justice and spend a lot of
attention looking at

00:21:46.289 --> 00:21:51.710
disproportionate allocation of
burdens or damages or pollution,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.808
where dangerous facilities are
located.

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:59.210
We'll also take a look at the
idea of risk and precaution.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.230
So what is acceptable risk?
 

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.817
Once it's calculated,
how do you determine what is

00:22:04.817 --> 00:22:05.769
acceptable?
 

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:09.519
If you look across the laws,
the different statutes have

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:13.338
very different definitions of
what acceptable risk is.

00:22:13.338 --> 00:22:17.347
We'll also think a lot about
the idea of precautionary law,

00:22:17.347 --> 00:22:19.558
as opposed to utilitarian law.
 

00:22:19.558 --> 00:22:24.328
So law that builds in safety
margins or buffer zones to

00:22:24.328 --> 00:22:28.038
protect against miscalculations
of risk.

00:22:28.038 --> 00:22:30.740
We did not do that when we
built nuclear power plants,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.608
and we've had several severe
accidents in the world,

00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:36.804
most notably Chernobyl that
we'll take a look at when we

00:22:36.804 --> 00:22:39.068
look at the nuclear power plant
case.

00:22:39.068 --> 00:22:43.474
So that thinking about when
should the government be allowed

00:22:43.474 --> 00:22:46.910
to balance risks or costs
against benefits,

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.540
and when should a fixed
standard of allowable risk drive

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.400
a decision?
 

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.358
Those are very difficult
questions.

00:22:54.358 --> 00:22:57.723
So that said,
I'd like to just briefly run

00:22:57.723 --> 00:23:02.484
through a set of slides here
that I think are reflective of

00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:05.848
the material that we'll be
reviewing.

00:23:05.848 --> 00:23:10.000
And I wanted to start with this
set of images from Thomas Cole,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.019
a well-known landscape artist
from the nineteenth century,

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.710
one of the Hudson River School
painters.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.719
Just to give you a sense of
where I came from,

00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:23.130
my background as an
undergraduate was in history.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.490
I had a fascination for English
literature,

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.719
but also the history of art,
but a very specialized form of

00:23:29.719 --> 00:23:32.372
art,
which was nineteenth and early

00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:34.730
twentieth century landscape art.
 

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.175
And I was always fascinated by
this series called The Course

00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:39.900
of Empire by Thomas Cole.
 

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.046
In the very first painting on
the lower left,

00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:46.480
you see what's thought of as
the savage state.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.963
And this is Thomas Cole's
obvious interpretation of the

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:53.288
evolution of civilization.
 

00:23:53.288 --> 00:23:57.608
So the savage state is wild,
it's hostile.

00:23:57.608 --> 00:24:02.240
I think of it in a way as being
wild lands, and I've always had

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.078
a strong fascination for wild
lands.

00:24:05.078 --> 00:24:08.509
When I was a child,
my dad always took me camping

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:12.365
or hiking up in the White
Mountains in New Hampshire or

00:24:12.365 --> 00:24:15.009
the Adirondacks or up in
Vermont.

00:24:15.009 --> 00:24:19.808
They really caused me to have
not just a fascination with it,

00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:21.730
but also a love of it.
 

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.912
Thinking about how society
might move from the savage or

00:24:26.912 --> 00:24:32.471
the wild state to the pastoral
or the Arcadian state is well

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.298
depicted in this painting.
 

00:24:35.298 --> 00:24:39.126
And many people,
when they're shown a variety of

00:24:39.126 --> 00:24:43.525
different landscapes if the
landscapes vary between the

00:24:43.525 --> 00:24:47.842
highly dense urban environment
all the way to the wild

00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:52.654
environment,
they prefer the pastoral,

00:24:52.654 --> 00:24:55.788
the agrarian landscape.
 

00:24:55.788 --> 00:25:00.678
The Consummation of
Empire is the next slide in

00:25:00.678 --> 00:25:03.630
the series, the urban setting.
 

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.888
And I also have had a
fascination with urban areas and

00:25:07.888 --> 00:25:11.821
have lived in Philadelphia,
I've lived in New Haven,

00:25:11.821 --> 00:25:15.440
I've lived in Sao Paula in
Brazil and in San Francisco,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.180
and eventually settled here in
Connecticut.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.615
But it's this juxtaposition
that I find so interesting,

00:25:22.615 --> 00:25:26.807
a love for the wild as well as
a love for a vibrant,

00:25:26.807 --> 00:25:28.038
urban core.
 

00:25:28.038 --> 00:25:31.807
And what happens in between in
terms of suburban sprawl will

00:25:31.807 --> 00:25:35.450
become central to several of the
cases that we look at.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.855
Cole then went on to think
about what happens if markets

00:25:39.855 --> 00:25:44.019
are completely unregulated --
destruction, damage.

00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:47.193
So we'll spend a good amount of
time thinking about how to

00:25:47.193 --> 00:25:50.480
predict damage and how important
this is in the structure of

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.039
environmental standards.
 

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:53.798
And then desolation.
 

00:25:53.798 --> 00:25:58.155
And many today have this image
of desolation 100,200 years down

00:25:58.155 --> 00:26:01.528
the road in response to global
climate change.

00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:06.259
So really, this set of
paintings structured my thinking

00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:09.150
in a variety of different ways.
 

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.960
It made me wonder about what
the potential of law is.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.026
What capacity do we have to
understand serious threats to

00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:22.237
the environment and to human
health, particularly over long

00:26:22.237 --> 00:26:23.690
periods of time?
 

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.509
What demands on science does
that make?

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:29.558
And how can we use law to
effectively reshape human

00:26:29.558 --> 00:26:32.608
behavior in a way that would be
more sensitive,

00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:35.988
that would ensure that when we
have twelve billion people in

00:26:35.988 --> 00:26:39.078
the world that we will have
adequate food supplies,

00:26:39.078 --> 00:26:41.941
we will have sufficient water,
it will be equitably

00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:44.942
distributed,
we will have clean air,

00:26:44.942 --> 00:26:47.503
and children,
grandchildren,

00:26:47.503 --> 00:26:52.411
future generations will have an
environment that they can be

00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:53.410
proud of.
 

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.296
I am certainly not proud of the
environment that my generation

00:26:56.296 --> 00:26:57.808
is leaving to your generation.
 

00:26:57.808 --> 00:26:59.940
And that really is,
that's the reason that I'm

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.740
standing here in front of you
today.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.726
I've decided in my career that
rather than working for

00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.903
government,
rather than working in the

00:27:07.903 --> 00:27:10.846
private sector,
that I would spend my life,

00:27:10.846 --> 00:27:13.948
the bulk of my career,
training future leaders,

00:27:13.948 --> 00:27:16.938
whether or not you move on into
the public sector or the private

00:27:16.938 --> 00:27:18.804
sector,
nonprofit world,

00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:22.836
to think, I hope,
differently about environmental

00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:26.028
quality and how you might shape
it.

00:27:26.028 --> 00:27:28.703
So the central questions here
that we'll be looking at,

00:27:28.703 --> 00:27:31.380
what's our capacity to manage
environmental quality?

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.009
What role has and could law
play in determining the future

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:36.730
of environmental quality?
 

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.784
And what's worked well,
what's failed,

00:27:39.784 --> 00:27:40.608
and why?
 

00:27:40.608 --> 00:27:42.720
If we can't answer these
questions,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.558
I would hazard to say that we
don't have much hope of making a

00:27:47.558 --> 00:27:52.161
dent in the kinds of problems
that we'll be facing over the

00:27:52.161 --> 00:27:53.509
next century.
 

00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:55.019
So the problems considered in
the course,

00:27:55.019 --> 00:27:57.098
national security,
land use, food safety,

00:27:57.098 --> 00:27:59.250
plastics, green building,
pesticides,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.769
air pollution,
tobacco, wild lands,

00:28:01.769 --> 00:28:03.528
national parks,
coastal development,

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:06.588
conservation policies,
urban and suburban growth,

00:28:06.588 --> 00:28:09.890
transport energy,
and drinking water.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:13.410
In my mind, what's worked well
and why?

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.836
Well, the nuclear weapons
history I think is quite

00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:16.528
fascinating.
 

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.545
There are some wonderful
lessons there about how we used

00:28:20.545 --> 00:28:24.853
state-of-the-art science in the
1950s to recognize a serious

00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:29.380
threat to human health and how
we intervened and eventually how

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.328
John F.
 

00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:35.145
Kennedy decided to ban the use
of testing of nuclear weapons in

00:28:35.145 --> 00:28:39.417
the atmosphere that was
resulting in strontium-90 in the

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:43.518
bones at high concentrations,
particularly among the

00:28:43.518 --> 00:28:45.108
youngest, the children.
 

00:28:45.108 --> 00:28:47.779
Population control has been a
success.

00:28:47.779 --> 00:28:52.396
Compared to the projections of
the 1970s by Paul Ehrlich and

00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:56.958
Julian Simon and others,
it's quite striking that the

00:28:56.958 --> 00:29:01.680
geometric projections have
diminished substantially,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.558
particularly in developing
parts of the world.

00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:07.948
The phase-out of chlorinated
hydrocarbons,

00:29:07.948 --> 00:29:12.162
including DDT and aldrin and
chlordane and dieldrin,

00:29:12.162 --> 00:29:14.890
heptachlor back in the 1970s.
 

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.096
These became one of the very
first targets of the

00:29:17.096 --> 00:29:18.660
Environmental Protection Agency.
 

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.883
And because they are fat
loving, they're lipophilic,

00:29:21.883 --> 00:29:24.537
they persisted,
they moved through the food

00:29:24.537 --> 00:29:25.170
chain.
 

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.440
They moved into our bodies.
 

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.962
And you and I are still
carrying around residues of many

00:29:31.962 --> 00:29:34.269
of these chlorinated
hydrocarbons.

00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:37.410
Your concentrations are lower
than mine are.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.980
But your concentrations
predominately came from your

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.730
mother via breast milk.
 

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.616
That's the mechanism of
transfer across generations for

00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:48.490
some of these compounds.
 

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.220
So phasing them out was a very
important thing to do.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.519
Lead in gasoline and paint were
phased out as well.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:59.830
Chlorinated fluorocarbons that
were and are responsible for

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.500
diminishing the ozone layer that
exists in the upper

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.993
stratosphere,
so that reducing CFCs and

00:30:07.993 --> 00:30:12.420
similar ozone-gobbling compounds
has been a success story,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.808
at least the rate of loss has
been stabilized.

00:30:15.808 --> 00:30:19.200
Polychlorinated biphenyl
reduction,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.938
these are chemicals originally
thought to be beneficial because

00:30:24.938 --> 00:30:30.584
they acted as a refrigerant and
flame retardant for electronic

00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:34.890
technologies,
such as electrical transformers.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.608
So that phasing out PCBs that
were building up in the tissues

00:30:39.608 --> 00:30:42.586
of wildlife,
particularly large mammals,

00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:45.219
as well as birds,
and also in human tissues,

00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:47.380
has been a very important
success story.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.923
Recognizing the threat of
asbestos in producing a very

00:30:50.923 --> 00:30:54.202
rare form of cancer called
mesothelioma was a very

00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:57.250
important step,
as well as the increasing

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:01.788
restriction on tobacco,
so that we're seeing a decline

00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:06.881
in some forms of lung cancer in
response to the tobacco

00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:08.390
restrictions.
 

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.409
And we're also seeing very
interesting declines in the rate

00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:16.498
of addiction in those parts of
the country where advertising

00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:20.656
has been most heavily restricted
and public service campaigns

00:31:20.656 --> 00:31:25.368
have been mounted to warn people
about the dangers of tobacco.

00:31:25.368 --> 00:31:28.811
We've also made some great
strides in the area of food

00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:32.059
safety, particularly in terms of
reducing microbial

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:33.230
contamination.
 

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.894
And also, the stellar success
story about the rise of organic

00:31:38.894 --> 00:31:44.750
food I think is something to
take note of and to learn from.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.988
So what are the most persistent
problems, the ones that have

00:31:47.988 --> 00:31:50.019
been hardest to deal with,
and why?

00:31:50.019 --> 00:31:54.279
Fossil fuel consumption,
renewable energy innovation in

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:57.750
part due to our lack of
subsidies relative to

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.009
subsidizing fossil fuels as well
as nuclear power.

00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:05.049
Radioactive materials,
the concentration of

00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:09.317
radioactive materials,
particularly for the production

00:32:09.317 --> 00:32:12.198
of weapons,
has created some of the most

00:32:12.198 --> 00:32:14.180
hazardous sites in the world.
 

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.558
So Hanford, Washington,
the Hanford Works in

00:32:17.558 --> 00:32:20.598
Washington,
as well as the Oakridge

00:32:20.598 --> 00:32:24.140
Laboratory or Savannah River in
Georgia,

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.259
these are seriously
contaminated sites.

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:31.058
Waste management has also been
a persistent problem.

00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:33.788
Our recycling efforts have
clearly failed us.

00:32:33.788 --> 00:32:36.396
Most people don't know the
difference between a plastic

00:32:36.396 --> 00:32:39.003
that is stamped with a number
six and a plastic that is

00:32:39.003 --> 00:32:40.548
stamped with a number three.
 

00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:44.369
And in fact,
I'll challenge you right now to

00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:49.880
go through one week of this term
without buying any plastic.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.906
And if anybody is capable of
doing that by the end of the

00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:56.640
term, I will take you out for
lunch.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.692
I've made that offer for the
past five years and I have not

00:33:02.692 --> 00:33:06.660
spent one dime on lunch as a
result.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.277
Transport, personal transport
as opposed to public transit

00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:13.450
facilities, is a persistent and
growing problem.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.704
We now have one vehicle in the
United States for every person

00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:18.170
who is eligible to drive.
 

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.470
That's nearly 250 million
vehicles.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.182
We have more vehicles per
capita in the United States than

00:33:24.182 --> 00:33:25.660
any other place in the world.
 

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.212
And we drive more miles per
person than any place in the

00:33:29.212 --> 00:33:29.730
world.
 

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:34.151
The failure to develop public
transit facilities is quite

00:33:34.151 --> 00:33:35.019
striking.
 

00:33:35.019 --> 00:33:38.624
Parks and protected areas,
we are not protecting areas the

00:33:38.624 --> 00:33:41.849
way that we were back in the
1970s and the 1980s.

00:33:41.849 --> 00:33:43.630
So why have we slowed down?
 

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.737
Why was the government in the
process of acquiring lands in

00:33:47.737 --> 00:33:51.065
the 1960s, '70s,
and '80s and building parks and

00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:54.038
building large corridors for
wildlife?

00:33:54.038 --> 00:33:57.684
To conserve biological
diversity, but also to provide

00:33:57.684 --> 00:34:00.490
wide-scale recreational
opportunities.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:05.730
So why have land acquisition
efforts been stalled?

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.440
Biological diversity loss is
also growing,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.603
in part because of the chemical
threats that I described earlier

00:34:12.603 --> 00:34:13.860
in the lecture.
 

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.045
There are nearly 450 million
acres of the United States

00:34:18.045 --> 00:34:21.764
landscape that are routinely
sprayed by biocides,

00:34:21.764 --> 00:34:24.710
pesticides of one sort or
another.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.753
There are 1,000 different
biocides that are each licensed

00:34:28.753 --> 00:34:29.909
independently.
 

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:33.733
So at that scale,
how could we not think that we

00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:37.070
would be threatening different
species?

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.018
Also agriculture.
 

00:34:39.018 --> 00:34:42.215
One of the great drivers of
loss of biological diversity in

00:34:42.215 --> 00:34:44.420
the world is agricultural
development.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.980
And you can see this in the
Amazon,

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.474
where tropical rain forests
that are some of the richest and

00:34:51.474 --> 00:34:55.436
most biologically diverse
ecosystems in the world are

00:34:55.436 --> 00:35:00.313
being ripped up and planted with
soybeans for either food or fuel

00:35:00.313 --> 00:35:01.610
production.
 

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.760
So we'll take a look at some of
the key drivers behind

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.949
biodiversity laws.
 

00:35:05.949 --> 00:35:10.126
Marine species exploitation,
we'll take a look at the

00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:13.500
decline of a variety of
commercial fish.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:20.641
We'll also be taking a look at
the tendency of large predatory

00:35:20.641 --> 00:35:23.570
fish to absorb mercury.
 

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.250
So mercury is emitted from
power plants.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.309
It's also emitted from
incinerators.

00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:32.480
It goes into global circulation
just like DDT would.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.349
It also rains down on the earth
and it bio-accumulates in large

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:39.960
predatory fish.
 

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.054
By the end of the term,
you'll understand which fish

00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:45.360
are safe and which are not,
and why.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.032
And you'll also question the
Bush administration's decision

00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:54.302
to lighten the regulation on
mercury emissions and how

00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:58.688
dangerous that has become,
particularly for the youngest

00:35:58.688 --> 00:35:59.469
in society.
 

00:35:59.469 --> 00:36:01.268
We'll take a look at indoor air
quality.

00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:05.527
And one aspect of this issue
that I'm quite interested in is

00:36:05.527 --> 00:36:09.135
the Environmental Protection
Agency spends probably

00:36:09.135 --> 00:36:13.248
ninety-five to ninety-eight
percent of its time and budget

00:36:13.248 --> 00:36:16.856
thinking about the environment
as being the outdoor

00:36:16.856 --> 00:36:18.300
environment.
 

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.177
Whereas we in the United States
now spend on average more than

00:36:22.177 --> 00:36:24.530
ninety percent of our time
indoors.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:29.300
And as somebody that is a dad
and cares about the future of

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.070
the environment and human
health, that's got me worried.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.099
People are spending less time
outside.

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:43.690
They're experiencing nature at
a lower rate than ever before.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.860
They are spending more time in
front of computers in indoor

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.610
environments than ever before.
 

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.947
And EPA does not do much to
regulate the environmental

00:36:52.947 --> 00:36:55.650
quality of indoor environments.
 

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:01.240
So the reasons for that are
sometimes obvious and sometimes

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:01.820
not.
 

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:07.273
One clearly is a respect for
privacy and private property

00:37:07.273 --> 00:37:08.150
rights.
 

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.009
But it means that anybody is
allowed to carry chemicals into

00:37:12.009 --> 00:37:15.398
the indoor environment,
including cleansers or

00:37:15.398 --> 00:37:19.619
pesticides or plastics that can
get into their bodies.

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:23.849
And there is basically no
regulation to prevent that.

00:37:23.849 --> 00:37:27.840
Hazardous sites,
the number of hazardous sites

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.340
now in the United States is more
than 350,000 on EPA's list.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.679
There are 50,000 different
hazardous sites that have been

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:40.079
severely contaminated that are
under the jurisdiction,

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:43.210
meaning the responsibility,
of the Department of Defense,

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.431
the Department of Energy,
and the Department of the

00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:47.139
Interior.
 

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:51.302
There are 340,000 sites that
are owned in the private sector

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:54.690
that have been classified by EPA
as hazardous.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:38:00.239
So the rate of cleanup of these
sites is not even one percent of

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:04.380
the rate of discovery of new
hazardous sites.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.219
So this problem of basically
disregarding the chemical abuse

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:13.277
of the landscape,
feeling comfortable to throw

00:38:13.277 --> 00:38:18.456
chemical mixtures out the back
door without concern for their

00:38:18.456 --> 00:38:23.027
persistence and movement,
this is something that your

00:38:23.027 --> 00:38:25.710
generation will have to deal
with.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.679
Product labeling will also be a
subject that we'll take on.

00:38:30.679 --> 00:38:36.092
Basically, if you look
carefully at product labels,

00:38:36.092 --> 00:38:40.639
you'll see claims of product
effectiveness,

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:46.920
product appeal associated with
color or functionality.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.949
You will not see much in the
way of claims or a demonstration

00:38:51.949 --> 00:38:57.230
of hazard or guidance about how
you might manage the hazards.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.677
So that product labeling could
be an effective way of conveying

00:39:00.677 --> 00:39:04.201
information to the public,
to inform consumers to make

00:39:04.201 --> 00:39:06.679
choices that are more
responsible.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:09.980
So how should we adjust product
labeling law in a way that makes

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.400
sense?
 

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.380
I asked this question with
respect to pesticides several

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.090
years ago and found something
quite interesting.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.891
If you look at a pesticide bag,
for example a fertilizer bag in

00:39:21.891 --> 00:39:23.670
say a Home Depot.
 

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.739
You'll see the green lawn with
the children playing on the lawn

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:28.920
and bright colors on the front
of the bag.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.940
And then the back of the bag in
print that may be eight point,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.101
it may be six point in size,
print that I have to take my

00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:39.039
glasses off and get very close
to be able to read.

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:44.753
The warnings are illegible and
unintelligible to a very large

00:39:44.753 --> 00:39:47.039
proportion of society.
 

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:49.840
And there are some twelve
percent of the U.S.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.813
population, not an
insignificant number in a

00:39:53.813 --> 00:39:57.050
population of 310 million
people.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:02.422
So ten percent that have no
capacity to read type that is

00:40:02.422 --> 00:40:05.300
less than ten point in font.
 

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.702
That means that those warning
labels could never be effective

00:40:08.702 --> 00:40:09.949
for that population.
 

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:14.034
If you add on to that
percentage, the group that is

00:40:14.034 --> 00:40:17.137
illiterate,
the group that does not have

00:40:17.137 --> 00:40:21.262
enough education in order to
understand what the risk is and

00:40:21.262 --> 00:40:24.722
how they might manage the risk,
gradually, you get up to a

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.789
percentage that's close to forty
percent of the U.S.

00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:30.969
population does not have the
capacity to understand a message

00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:34.871
of hazard or the capacity to
interpret how to manage that

00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:39.262
hazard in a way that would cause
the environment to be protected

00:40:39.262 --> 00:40:41.909
or human health to be protected.
 

00:40:41.909 --> 00:40:45.601
So the statutes we'll look at,
I'm not going to go through all

00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:48.206
of these now,
but we'll go through the major

00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:49.780
statutes and the book.
 

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.266
Weinberg and Reilly will give
you a very concise,

00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:55.219
quick overview of the key
provisions of these statutes.

00:40:55.219 --> 00:41:00.748
And I will show you how the
statutes apply individually to

00:41:00.748 --> 00:41:02.690
the various cases.
 

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.213
We'll take a look,
not just at the chemical

00:41:04.213 --> 00:41:06.306
management statutes,
but also the federal land and

00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:09.003
resource management statutes,
such as the Wilderness Act,

00:41:09.003 --> 00:41:11.735
the Endangered Species Act,
the National Park Service

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:14.909
Organic Act,
and several others.

00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:18.070
Additional crucial statutes
that you might not think about

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.119
as being environmental in nature
include patent law,

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:24.954
governing trade secrecy,
the Freedom of Information Act

00:41:24.954 --> 00:41:28.788
that gives you the right to
request from the government

00:41:28.788 --> 00:41:33.119
information about public policy
or about the environment.

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:36.632
I'll pause here and just ask
how many of you have made

00:41:36.632 --> 00:41:40.610
requests under the Freedom of
Information Act to a government

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.340
agency?
 

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.039
That's very interesting.
 

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:46.096
The majority of people that do
that in society are highly

00:41:46.096 --> 00:41:46.860
specialized.
 

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.643
They work in the private sector
or they are lawyers,

00:41:49.643 --> 00:41:52.210
they're using them as the basis
for lawsuits.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.418
So the Freedom of Information
Act was intended to democratize

00:41:56.418 --> 00:42:00.347
information that was held inside
libraries and government

00:42:00.347 --> 00:42:01.260
agencies.
 

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.193
But it's been highly
ineffective in a variety of

00:42:04.193 --> 00:42:04.630
ways.
 

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.059
The National Security Act,
the War Powers Act,

00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:09.989
the Administrative Procedures
Act, Homeland Security,

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:13.639
the Patriot Act,
and different budget statutes,

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:19.932
ranging from subsidies to
authorizations for funding for

00:42:19.932 --> 00:42:20.619
EPA.
 

00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:23.780
And these statutes are
absolutely crucial.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.452
So you can imagine a law being
passed, that -- let's say the

00:42:29.452 --> 00:42:34.739
law had the intent to protect
the environment from a new

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:36.760
plastic compound.
 

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.507
So that law might be passed and
it might demand that the

00:42:41.507 --> 00:42:44.268
chemical be tested thoroughly.
 

00:42:44.268 --> 00:42:48.550
It might demand that it be
labeled in a way that would

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.670
ensure that it would be managed
more effectively.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:58.389
It might assign penalties for
deviance.

00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:02.159
But in Congress,
if Congress doesn't allocate

00:43:02.159 --> 00:43:05.760
the money to EPA,
the program will fail.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.041
So the industry recognizes this
quite clearly,

00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:15.369
that they have not lost the
battle if a law is passed.

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:18.628
They will have an opportunity
year after year to go back to

00:43:18.628 --> 00:43:21.717
Congress and try to block
allocation for monitoring that

00:43:21.717 --> 00:43:23.739
issue, for enforcing that issue.
 

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:27.280
And that explains a lot of the
ineffectiveness of twentieth

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.989
century environmental law.
 

00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:32.686
So on Thursday,
we'll come back to a discussion

00:43:32.686 --> 00:43:36.623
about different types of
strategies to protect the

00:43:36.623 --> 00:43:39.625
environment,
different decision standards

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:42.018
that are embedded in different
statutes.

00:43:42.018 --> 00:43:46.088
And we'll particularly take up
this issue of distributional

00:43:46.088 --> 00:43:46.789
effects.
 

00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:50.112
How some chemicals behave
differently than others,

00:43:50.112 --> 00:43:54.114
they result in exposures to
some groups that are higher than

00:43:54.114 --> 00:43:54.860
others.
 

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.235
And also thinking about how
costs as well as benefits are

00:43:59.235 --> 00:44:04.159
allocated quite differently in
society by environmental laws.

00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:09.371
So I'm going to pause there and
just take a couple of minutes

00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:12.500
for any questions that you've
got.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.650
Yes?
 

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:18.849
Student: 
&gt;

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:21.119
Prof: Could you repeat
that please?

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:23.449
Student: 
&gt;

00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:25.050
Prof: Yes.
 

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.597
After the lecture each day,
the lecture slides will be

00:44:28.597 --> 00:44:29.670
posted online.
 

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:34.179
Also, I will use the Classes
server quite regularly.

00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:37.550
Some of the readings that you
will have assigned to you will

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.195
be on the Classes server,
so that some of the discussion

00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:45.016
sections as well may use
strategies to pose questions and

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:49.179
I'll require your responses on
the Classes server as well.

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:49.780
Yes?
 

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.079
Student:  And will you
hold office hours?

00:44:51.079 --> 00:44:52.630
Prof: Will I hold office
hours?

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.914
I will hold office hours,
and I will announce those on

00:44:54.914 --> 00:44:55.389
Thursday.
 

00:44:55.389 --> 00:44:58.309
Student:  Okay.
 

00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:59.150
Prof: Anything else?
 

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.940
Well thank you very much for
joining me.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:06.000

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.730
Professor John Rogers:
Paradise Regained.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.817
Well, as anyone who's read
-- and maybe there's someone

00:00:08.817 --> 00:00:12.975
here in this room who has read
the continuation of the novel

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:17.344
Gone with the Wind -- as
anyone who has read that

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:19.274
knows,
or as anyone who's seen,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.623
let's say, "The Bride of
Chucky" or "The Fast and the

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:23.646
Furious,
Part 3," knows,

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:30.059
sequels are rarely greater than
the original works whose stories

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.567
they continue.
It's almost as if the

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:38.898
diminished appeal was something
like an inevitable and necessary

00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:42.528
fact of the sequel.
It just comes attached to the

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:46.293
notion of the sequel.
I think that the disappointment

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:49.498
aroused by a sequel,
a sequel of any kind,

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:52.860
is a phenomenon about which
John Milton,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.156
as he wrote Paradise
Regained, must have

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:02.101
been extremely aware.It was
Thomas Elwood -- he was one of

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.560
the young men who acted as a
secretary for Milton -- who

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.775
claimed years after the poet's
death that he had been

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.991
responsible for Milton's having
written the sequel to

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:19.067
Paradise Lost.
He recorded having told

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:22.632
Milton after he had read an
early manuscript copy of

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.965
Paradise Lost -- this is
before Paradise Lost was

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:31.019
even in print -- he reports to
us having told Milton,

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:34.413
"Thou hast said much here of
paradise lost,

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:38.209
but what hast thou to say of
paradise found?"

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.159
And then Elwood continues,
and it's [laughs]

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.027
a wonderful little bit of
information: "Milton made no

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:52.355
answer to me but sat some time
in a muse."Like a lot of

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:56.408
critics of Milton,
I have a hard time believing

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:59.115
that it was Elwood,
squirmy little Elwood,

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:02.483
who planted the idea of a
sequel to Paradise Lost

00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:05.654
in Milton's head,
but I think it's nonetheless

00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:08.719
interesting that this story has
been so widely circulated.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:13.428
It's almost invariably cited by
scholars of Paradise Regained

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:17.837
because I think in some way
readers are looking for some

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:21.500
excuse really for Milton's
having written it.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.752
Paradise Lost seems in
itself so absolutely complete

00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:28.069
and so magnificent.
The idea that it requires a

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.426
sequel is one that seems
suspicious or questionable to a

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:36.572
lot of Milton's readers.Now,
Milton's own nephew,

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:39.453
Edward Phillips,
described the way in which

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:43.295
readers even in Milton's
lifetime judged the sequel to be

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:46.930
the inferior,
the lesser of the two works.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.940
Phillips tells us in his
biography -- and this is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.138
actually usefully included in
the back of the Hughes

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:56.901
edition -- Phillips tells
us that Paradise Regained

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.039
"is generally censured to be
much inferior to the other,

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.933
though [Milton]
could not hear with patience

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.490
any such thing when related to
him."

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.002
I love this image of the old
man impatient with any comment

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:15.048
that might belittle the
accomplishment of the sequel,

00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:17.849
and I think it's a moving
image.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.607
If Milton's nephew is right
here, as I suspect he is,

00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:23.364
then I think it's worth
pursuing the reason for which

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:26.439
Milton might have considered
Paradise Regained,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.699
 the sequel,
to be the greater work or a

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.384
work in some way more
sophisticated and more advanced

00:03:33.384 --> 00:03:37.406
than Paradise Lost.
I think in a lot of ways it is

00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:40.630
exactly that.Now,
surely one of the first things

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.233
that we notice when we read the
sequel to Paradise Lost

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:47.710
is really the radical
difference of its style.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.401
The literary style,
or what we can think of as the

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.488
verbal texture,
of Paradise Regained

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:55.565
really constitutes one of
its greatest departures and

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.586
obviously one of its most
deliberate departures from the

00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:01.532
first epic.
Although most readers of

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:05.891
Regained find it less
stylistically pleasing than

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.367
Lost,
 Milton has embraced

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:10.560
this style, I think,
for an important reason.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.629
He has very consciously imposed
a set of constraints on his

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.611
verbal style and a set of
constraints on his entire poetic

00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.902
imagination.
Our appreciation of the beauty

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:27.120
and the meaning of this poem is
actually, I think,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.165
inextricable for our
understanding of this poem --

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:35.789
our understanding of the
severity of the lesson that this

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.826
poem has to teach us.This
poet -- and we know this because

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:45.119
we've spent a lot of time with
John Milton now -- was

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:50.156
instinctively given to verbal
excess to an almost unimaginable

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:53.317
degree.
He clearly had to struggle hard

00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:56.548
to rein in a lot of his most
powerful literary impulses in

00:04:56.548 --> 00:04:59.949
order to produce a work such as
Paradise Regained,

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.509
a work of such seemingly
charmless severity.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.749
This poem has been scrubbed
clean of verbal and imagistic

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.004
extravagance,
scrubbed cleaner even than the

00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:16.259
last two books of Paradise
Lost,

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.670
which were themselves radical
departures.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.297
I think in a lot of ways
Paradise Regained

00:05:22.297 --> 00:05:26.000
resembles stylistically,
in terms of its verbal texture,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.348
the last books of Paradise
Lost.Now,

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:31.055
Milton has purged this poem as
well of the grammatical

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.660
obscurity,
the syntactical obscurity that

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.286
we found in Paradise Lost.
You remember all of those

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.460
ambiguities, syntactical
ambiguities, that were always

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.172
opening up far more signifying
possibilities than we could even

00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:47.985
begin to deal with.
Milton has clipped so many of

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.916
those long and wandering
sentences into short and

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:56.164
unequivocal declarations,
and he's replaced the lushness

00:05:56.164 --> 00:06:00.202
of so many of those similes and
literary ornaments with what we

00:06:00.202 --> 00:06:04.045
can think of as the Puritan
austerity of simple argument and

00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:08.630
simple statement of fact.
This poem has been written in

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.799
what is often described now as
the period's plain style --

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:17.518
something like the
conversational style of

00:06:17.518 --> 00:06:21.217
unambiguous,
straightforward language that

00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:24.938
was supposedly favored by the
Puritan clergy in the

00:06:24.938 --> 00:06:27.769
seventeenth century,
and I think that makes sense.

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.534
This poem has been written in
what we can think of as the

00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:34.290
plain style.But if that's
the case,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.501
how strange and how surprising
that this poem,

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.997
which is written in a poetic
language as plain and

00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:44.779
unambiguous as anything Milton
ever put on paper,

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.892
how unbelievably odd it is that
this poem paints for us a world

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:54.509
in which so few statements can
actually be understood!

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.208
All of the characters in
Paradise Regained,

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.348
and I'm including -- there
aren't that many of them -- but

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.980
I'm including,
of course, the Son of God.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.777
All of the characters fail at
some time or another to

00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:10.720
understand even the clearest,
even the most perspicuous

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.596
language.
Much like Adam in Books Eleven

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:16.934
and Twelve of Paradise
Lost, the characters in

00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:20.851
Paradise Regained are on
some level profoundly clueless

00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:24.574
and their cognitive incapacity
-- which actually comes in a

00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:28.345
variety of shapes,
depending where you are in the

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:31.955
poem -- their cognitive
incapacity usually involves

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:35.564
their inability to interpret
fully and to interpret

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:40.112
accurately a statement or a text
that in our estimation seems to

00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:44.516
be just about as clear and as
unambiguous as it could possibly

00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:47.906
be.Now,
one of the texts that proves so

00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:51.737
puzzling to the characters of
Paradise Regained is also

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.500
a puzzle to Adam in Paradise
Lost,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.729
and so I want to look back at
the ending of Paradise Lost

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.337
in order to see a way in
which that poem had been

00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:08.060
preparing us all along for the
sequel.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.724
I think you'll remember our
mentioning in class that odd and

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:17.151
sometimes irritating way in
which Adam was always jumping

00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:22.132
the gun in his interpretation of
future Christian history in the

00:08:22.132 --> 00:08:25.689
lesson that Michael was
presenting him.

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:29.045
One of the central historical
documents that Adam seemed

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:32.522
particularly predisposed to
misinterpret was what is known

00:08:32.522 --> 00:08:37.322
as the Protoevangelium,
and that's been spelled for

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:41.291
you,
P-r-o-t-o-e-v-a-n-g-e-l-i-u-m,

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:48.529
on your handout so you don't
need my orthography right now.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.723
The Protoevangelium,
which is the Greek for "the

00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:54.509
first gospel" or "the first good
news,"

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:59.152
is one of the ways in which
Christians refer to Genesis 3:

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:01.965
14 and 15.
It's the prophecy from the Book

00:09:01.965 --> 00:09:04.629
of Genesis that God delivers to
the serpent.

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:07.969
God prophesied that the
serpent's eventual punishment --

00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:11.672
and this is on the handout --
that the serpent eventually will

00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:15.011
be punished: "And I will put
enmity between thee and the

00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:17.634
woman,
and between thy seed and her

00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:19.936
seed;
it shall bruise thy head,

00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:22.894
and thou shalt bruise his
heel."Now,

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:27.596
this is the anticipation of the
end as presented -- as imagined

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:30.877
in Genesis.
It's this text that the New

00:09:30.877 --> 00:09:35.164
Testament uses to forge a
connection between the story of

00:09:35.164 --> 00:09:38.063
Christ,
which is obviously the New

00:09:38.063 --> 00:09:41.593
Testament story,
and the initial text in the

00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:44.854
tradition,
which is the story of Adam and

00:09:44.854 --> 00:09:46.287
Eve.
For Christians,

00:09:46.287 --> 00:09:49.134
Christ of course is the woman's
seed, the

00:09:49.134 --> 00:09:53.119
great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandson of Adam and

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.319
Eve.
He will one day bruise the head

00:09:56.319 --> 00:09:59.291
of the serpent,
who is interpreted by

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:03.831
Christians to be Satan even as
Satan will be dogging his

00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:07.431
steps.Now,
the text of this prophecy is

00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:11.423
reproduced and reworked,
I think, almost to a compulsive

00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:15.628
degree in Paradise Lost.
Allusions to the prophecy

00:10:15.628 --> 00:10:18.006
in Genesis, the
Protoevangelium,

00:10:18.006 --> 00:10:21.784
appear in five separate
places in the last books of

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:25.771
Milton's epic and actually in
far more places than that in

00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.425
Paradise Regained.
This prophecy is a text

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:32.691
that has to be read and
interpreted, it's mulled over

00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:36.037
and reinterpreted,
and it's Michael's task in the

00:10:36.037 --> 00:10:40.024
last books of Paradise Lost
to teach Adam how to read

00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:42.874
it.
Adam has to figure out -- and

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:48.101
this actually in itself requires
a lot of tutelage on Michael's

00:10:48.101 --> 00:10:51.980
part -- that the serpent is
actually Satan.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.398
That's nothing that comes
instinctively or intuitively to

00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:57.301
Adam, he also must learn that,
of course, the seed is the

00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:00.695
Messiah who Adam will eventually
interpret to be the Son of

00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:04.030
God.Let's look at the end of
Paradise Lost here

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.424
because Michael is not only
teaching Adam how to understand

00:11:07.424 --> 00:11:11.357
the Protoevangelium,
but he's teaching us also I

00:11:11.357 --> 00:11:15.009
think -- preparing us to read
Paradise Regained.

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:19.360
So this is page 463 in the
Hughes.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.523
It's Book Ten of --
actually, I'm going to be

00:11:24.523 --> 00:11:28.539
skipping around.
The first passage that we'll be

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:30.820
looking at is Book Ten,
line 179.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.990
That's when the Son delivers
the prophecy to the serpent.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.309
Then at line 500 of Book Ten,
we see Satan trying to figure

00:11:38.309 --> 00:11:41.659
out what the Son could possibly
have meant.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.499
In Book Eleven,
line 115 -- if you can flip

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:48.690
through pages fast enough -- God
himself explains to Michael in

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.529
heaven about the prophecy of the
seed.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.303
Then Michael dutifully relays
this message to Adam himself in

00:11:56.303 --> 00:12:00.378
Book Twelve, line 150.Now,
there's obviously an excessive

00:12:00.378 --> 00:12:03.435
proliferation here of prophetic
statements, so excessive that

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:06.390
you probably weren't able to
flip through your books nearly

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.567
quickly enough.
It's no wonder that Adam is

00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:14.360
really beside himself with such
an eager desire to get to the

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.233
end -- so obsessively is this
prophecy of the end presented at

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:23.270
the end of Paradise Lost.
Adam has learned about the

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.372
birth of Jesus,
he's learned about the Messiah

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:27.240
who will actually be born of a
woman,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.296
called "the woman's seed" in
the Book of Genesis,

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:33.861
and he thinks he has this
prophecy of the seed completely

00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:36.759
figured out.
He thinks he understands now

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:40.250
how the story of Christian
history is going to end.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:53.509
So this is line 375 of Book
Twelve at the top of page 463:

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:56.932
O Prophet of glad
tidings, [Adam says,]

00:12:56.932 --> 00:12:59.670
finisher
Of utmost hope!

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.818
now clear I understand
What oft my steadiest thoughts

00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:06.138
have searcht in vain,
Why our great expectation

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:10.460
should be call'd
The seed of Woman…

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.157
Of course -- and we're used to
this because we've read the last

00:13:14.157 --> 00:13:17.915
two books of Paradise Lost --
Adam is wrong to think that

00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:21.493
he has a clear understanding of
the great expectations of the

00:13:21.493 --> 00:13:24.258
end.
He imagines once again with a

00:13:24.258 --> 00:13:28.295
kind of singularly dull-witted
literalism just how this

00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:31.659
prophecy of the seed is going to
play out.

00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:38.074
So at line 383 Adam says,
"Needs must the Serpent now his

00:13:38.074 --> 00:13:44.832
capital bruise / Expect with
mortal pain: say where and when

00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:48.899
/ Thir fight,
what stroke shall bruise the

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:51.335
Victor's heel."
Adam, of course,

00:13:51.335 --> 00:13:55.471
had utterly imagined -- or
imagined precisely the wrong

00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:58.250
kind of ending.
This isn't going to be a

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.924
physical fight whose victory can
be pinned down to some specific

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:06.192
time and specific place,
a kind of terrifying event for

00:14:06.192 --> 00:14:11.038
which tickets could be
purchased.Michael recognizes

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:15.794
Adam's interpretation as a
misinterpretation and so he

00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:19.729
corrects it.
At line 386 Michael tells Adam

00:14:19.729 --> 00:14:23.424
this: "Dream not of thir fight,
/ As of a Duel,

00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:27.360
or the local wounds / Of head
or heel…"

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.874
We're not supposed to imagine
some gunslinger showdown at the

00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:34.506
end of time between the Messiah
and the serpent -- and remember

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:38.080
that Adam is still imagining the
serpent being a serpent;

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.029
he hasn't yet figured out that
the serpent is Satan.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:44.278
We're not going to have an
actual war capable of producing

00:14:44.278 --> 00:14:46.132
actual wounds.
Adam, of course,

00:14:46.132 --> 00:14:49.668
in his defense -- and I think
he does need a little defending

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:52.850
here -- has in mind the story of
the war in heaven,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.931
the story of an actual fight
full of local wounds that -- all

00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:01.614
two local wounds,
they were healed instantly --

00:15:01.614 --> 00:15:04.690
that Raphael had conveyed to
him, of course,

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.267
in Book Six and which David
Currell had wonderfully

00:15:08.267 --> 00:15:11.773
explicated for our
benefit.But the battle that

00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:16.352
will turn out to reconfigure all
of Christian history isn't going

00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:20.501
to proceed along the vulgarly
literal line set forth in the

00:15:20.501 --> 00:15:24.635
war in heaven.
It's as if Michael is trying to

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:28.720
tell Adam to forget everything
that Raphael told him,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.711
to forget that monumental war
that Raphael had relayed,

00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:36.702
because that kind of thing
simply isn't going to happen

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:40.208
anymore.
The fight between Satan and the

00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:44.853
seed, or the serpent and the
seed, is going to be a much

00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:48.541
subtler one.
The Messiah will begin his

00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:54.221
destruction of the serpent by
becoming a man himself just like

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:57.759
Adam had become a man at his
birth.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:01.907
That seems to be pretty much
the gist of Michael's theology

00:16:01.907 --> 00:16:04.409
in Paradise
Lost.Well,

00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:07.794
so Milton finishes Paradise
Lost, evidently he begins

00:16:07.794 --> 00:16:11.236
Paradise Regained even
before Paradise Lost has

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:17.078
found its way into print,
and Paradise Regained is

00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:21.929
published four years later in
1671.

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:26.280
It's all about that redemption,
that regaining of paradise that

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.490
Michael had prophesied at the
end of Paradise Lost,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.640
and, as you can tell from the
title of the sequel,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.820
Paradise Regained is all
about returning and repetition.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.996
We shouldn't think that the
sequel here is simply repeating

00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:48.350
and elaborating on the ideas
with which the original poem had

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.922
concluded.
While it's true that

00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:54.756
Paradise Regained does
repeat the Protoevangelium --

00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:58.524
that prophecy of the Son's
destruction of the serpent that

00:16:58.524 --> 00:17:01.500
we finally figure out is
actually Satan,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.192
and it proves to be just as
obsessively interested in that

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:09.079
bizarre prophecy as Paradise
Lost was -- this new poem

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.930
repeats that prophecy with a
difference.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.644
I think there are all sorts of
ways in which the poem is

00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:22.130
exploring and re-exploring a lot
of the implications and a lot of

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.102
the consequences of the very
idea of repetition implicit or

00:17:27.102 --> 00:17:31.302
compacted in that prefix
re- of Paradise

00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:34.856
Regained.
This is a work devoted to

00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:38.905
how the lost paradise will
eventually become the regained

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:41.869
paradise.Obviously for
Christians,

00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:48.238
orthodox Christians of almost
any stripe, that regaining,

00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:53.470
that redemption will hinge on
the atonement,

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.640
on the moment of the
crucifixion.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.660
Well, that's pretty much out of
the question for Milton,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.118
so we have to ask the question:
how does Milton account

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:08.700
for that pivotal moment in
Christian history,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.591
the turning point from the old
covenant with God to the new

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.833
covenant?
How does Milton imagine the

00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:18.230
shift from Paradise Lost
to Paradise Regained?

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.306
The answer -- as we have come
to recognize because these are

00:18:22.306 --> 00:18:26.659
the kinds of the answers that we
get when we ask questions about

00:18:26.659 --> 00:18:29.630
Milton -- the answer is a
shocking one.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.635
Milton quite simply doesn't
mention -- and this is

00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:38.458
unspeakably sublime -- he just
doesn't bother to mention the

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:43.200
crucifixion in Paradise
Regained.Of course,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.464
we already know that the
subject of the crucifixion is

00:18:46.464 --> 00:18:49.789
one that Milton has long had an
awkward relation to.

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:53.298
He wasn't able to finish that
early poem, "The Passion," that

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.672
he had written as a young man.
In this new poem,

00:18:56.672 --> 00:19:01.092
Paradise Regained,
the story ends before the

00:19:01.092 --> 00:19:05.599
crucifixion even takes place
because for Milton,

00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:08.635
in this absolutely remarkable
poem, the crowning moment of

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:11.617
Christian history and the point
at which lost paradise is

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.119
actually regained -- something
that we are,

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:17.526
of course, all ourselves the
beneficiaries of -- it has

00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:21.185
nothing whatsoever to do with
the Father's sacrifice of the

00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:23.562
Son.
And it has nothing to do with

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.079
the magnificent battle,
for that matter,

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:30.435
between Satan and the Messiah.
It's a moment mentioned rather

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:34.960
briefly in a couple of gospel
accounts of the life of Jesus.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.881
The Gospel of Matthew and the
Gospel of Luke narrate the story

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:44.560
of Jesus fasting -- this all
happens in a few verses in the

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.400
New Testament -- the story of
Jesus fasting for forty days in

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.756
the wilderness and the three
temptations to which Satan

00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:57.710
subjected Jesus during that
time.Now,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.578
in the Gospel of Luke,
which is the version that

00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:05.797
Milton follows most closely,
Satan tempts the Son three

00:20:05.797 --> 00:20:09.452
times.
He asks the Son to turn stones

00:20:09.452 --> 00:20:14.664
into bread in order to free
himself, and of course the Son

00:20:14.664 --> 00:20:17.679
refuses.
He asks the Son to accept all

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:20.796
the kingdoms of the world as
Satan's own gift,

00:20:20.796 --> 00:20:24.186
and the Son refuses.
And he asks the Son to prove

00:20:24.186 --> 00:20:28.164
his divinity by casting himself
off the pinnacle of the temple,

00:20:28.164 --> 00:20:31.632
and the Son refuses.
That pretty much is it,

00:20:31.632 --> 00:20:35.789
three temptations and three
acts of resistance;

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:40.216
and it is this simple -- and of
course nothing is ever that

00:20:40.216 --> 00:20:44.338
simple, but it's this more or
less simple resistance of

00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:48.459
temptation in Paradise
Regained that constitutes

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:52.275
the very center of Christian
history.This is an

00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:56.814
extraordinary and,
for me, unbelievable way of

00:20:56.814 --> 00:21:02.396
rethinking and re-imagining
Christian theology and the story

00:21:02.396 --> 00:21:07.658
of Christian history itself.
The very premise of this poem

00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:12.476
is, I think, a transgressive
one, utterly changing all of the

00:21:12.476 --> 00:21:16.170
emphases in traditional
Christian doctrine.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.774
The focal point,
of course, in Milton's poem

00:21:18.774 --> 00:21:22.350
isn't really theological.
It's not mystical or

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.253
sacramental: it's ethical.
It's not the magic or the

00:21:26.253 --> 00:21:29.127
mysticism of the crucifixion or
the resurrection that has

00:21:29.127 --> 00:21:31.900
anything to do with the
regaining of paradise here.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:37.825
It is a simple and entirely,
I think, un-miraculous action

00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:42.335
of behaving ethically.
It's something that any of us

00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:46.297
could do.As I mentioned a
minute ago, this poem is all

00:21:46.297 --> 00:21:50.926
about returning and repetition,
and the Protoevangelium is a

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:55.297
text to which the characters are
themselves continually

00:21:55.297 --> 00:21:58.313
returning.
But there there's another text

00:21:58.313 --> 00:22:00.866
that is repeated,
if you can believe it,

00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:04.990
even more obsessively than that
in Paradise Regained,

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.636
 and that's the scene in
which Jesus is baptized by John

00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:10.775
the Baptist.
The scene of the baptism is

00:22:10.775 --> 00:22:13.261
narrated first -- it happens
right at the beginning,

00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:15.260
at line twenty-nine of the
first book.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:22.289
This is page 483 in the Hughes.
We have to look at this passage.

00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:26.553
It's narrated first in Book
One, line twenty-nine and

00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:30.816
following, and then it's
repeated and referred to and

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:35.654
worried about at least four
times after that over the course

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:39.790
of the poem.
This is what we first learn: 

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.505
[O]n him baptiz'd
Heaven open'd,

00:22:42.505 --> 00:22:46.411
and in likeness of a Dove
The Spirit descended,

00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:51.404
while the Father's voice
From Heav'n pronounced him his

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:55.966
beloved Son.
Now, we of course read what I

00:22:55.966 --> 00:23:00.799
take to be these relatively
simple and unimaginative lines,

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.241
and if anything,
I think, we should be

00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:06.869
overwhelmed by their exceptional
straightforwardness.

00:23:06.869 --> 00:23:09.331
It's almost impossible to
understand [laughs]

00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:12.744
what it is about this baptismal
pronouncement that could prove

00:23:12.744 --> 00:23:15.430
so troublesome and so difficult
in the poem,

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.748
but no one in the poem -- and
that includes,

00:23:18.748 --> 00:23:22.916
of course, the Son of God
himself -- no one in the poem

00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:27.162
has anything even close to a
clear idea about what these

00:23:27.162 --> 00:23:31.715
lines actually mean.This
radical uncertainty at the very

00:23:31.715 --> 00:23:35.961
heart of the poem involves the
fact that this incredibly

00:23:35.961 --> 00:23:40.360
important revelation is the
product merely of the Father's

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.665
voice.
We're no longer in the world of

00:23:43.665 --> 00:23:47.495
Paradise Lost where man
can commune directly with angels

00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:51.078
and even with the Son of God
with some frequency and with a

00:23:51.078 --> 00:23:55.645
degree of relative ease.
Nowhere in Paradise Regained

00:23:55.645 --> 00:23:58.690
is divinity actually
present.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.908
Deity isn't palpable;
it's not indisputably there in

00:24:01.908 --> 00:24:04.892
the world of this poem,
and all we have is the Father's

00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:07.033
voice,
his pronouncements,

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:12.224
or in other words all we have
is a text just like the text of

00:24:12.224 --> 00:24:15.769
scripture -- or in fact,
it is the text of scripture.

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:20.799
The Father has left us with a
little trail of his presence

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:24.240
[laughs]
in the form of the words of the

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.732
Hebrew Bible,
and everyone in the poem is

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:31.789
desperately scrambling to
interpret this verbal trail,

00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:35.904
these words.All of this is
a way of saying that the

00:24:35.904 --> 00:24:40.020
universe of Paradise Regained
is essentially,

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.205
to my mind, a secular one.
This is essentially the world

00:24:45.205 --> 00:24:48.596
that Milton had introduced us to
at the end of Paradise

00:24:48.596 --> 00:24:51.051
Lost,
 and in this secular

00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:54.985
world all one can really do is
read the text and try to figure

00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:58.681
out what it means.
This is all that Satan and the

00:24:58.681 --> 00:25:03.130
Son are in a position to do in
Paradise Regained,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.925
and I think this is what gives
this poem its powerfully

00:25:06.925 --> 00:25:10.830
Modernist feel.
It's as skeptical and uncertain

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:16.076
as it is possible for such a
profoundly and piously religious

00:25:16.076 --> 00:25:19.420
poem to be,
if that oxymoronic statement

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.205
makes any sense.Look at how
Satan reacts to the

00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:27.900
pronouncement of God at the
baptism that we just looked at,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:34.049
the pronouncement that this is
my beloved Son,

00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:39.671
line thirty-three:
That heard the Adversary,

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:41.947
who roving still
About the world,

00:25:41.947 --> 00:25:44.330
at that assembly fam'd
Would not be last,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.570
and with the voice divine
Nigh Thunderstruck,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.400
th' exalted man,
to whom

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.230
Such high attest was giv'n,
a while survey'd

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.498
With wonder…
Satan rushes to the

00:25:56.498 --> 00:26:00.309
congregation of angels assembled
at the river Jordan because he

00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:03.936
wants to hear -- as the other
angels do -- to hear the "high

00:26:03.936 --> 00:26:07.809
attest" that God is bestowing
upon this man from Nazareth,

00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:12.250
this nobody who was "the Son of
Joseph deem'd."

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.224
It's as at his hearing of this
divine voice that Satan is

00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:19.986
"Thunderstruck."Now,
"thunderstruck" is a striking

00:26:19.986 --> 00:26:23.102
word here.
It bursts out of this passage

00:26:23.102 --> 00:26:26.688
as a little metaphor,
and we're taking whatever we

00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:29.546
can get here.
We take note of it because

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:33.502
Milton has given us so little by
way of poetic metaphor in the

00:26:33.502 --> 00:26:37.199
severely restrained literary
world of Paradise Regained

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:41.003
that we're grateful.
The word "thunderstruck" is,

00:26:41.003 --> 00:26:45.057
in fact, so striking and so
powerful that Milton has used it

00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:48.079
only one other time in all of
his poetry.

00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:54.019
It's clear here that Milton is
asking us to remember that

00:26:54.019 --> 00:27:00.277
earlier occurrence so I'm going
to ask you: Does anyone here

00:27:00.277 --> 00:27:06.959
remember where else in Milton --
extra credit here -- where else

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:13.430
in Milton we have encountered
the word "thunderstruck"?

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.806
Okay.
No one in Paradise Regained

00:27:17.806 --> 00:27:21.064
seems to have remembered the
appearance [laughs]

00:27:21.064 --> 00:27:23.554
of the word either,
and so you're in good

00:27:23.554 --> 00:27:26.654
company.If we can imagine
the inhabitants of the world of

00:27:26.654 --> 00:27:29.599
Paradise Regained having
been in a position to read

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:32.750
Paradise Lost -- which is
something I think that Milton

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.261
sometimes asks us to imagine,
although of course it's

00:27:36.261 --> 00:27:40.354
preposterous -- it's clear,
I think, that Milton is asking

00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:43.369
us to remember that earlier
occurrence,

00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:48.001
so I'm going to ask you to turn
to page 343 of Paradise Lost,

00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:52.012
the Hughes edition.
This is the climactic

00:27:52.012 --> 00:27:55.214
moment -- oh,
and actually I have included

00:27:55.214 --> 00:28:00.057
this handily on your handout --
the moment in the war in heaven

00:28:00.057 --> 00:28:05.289
at which the Son of God assumes
the chariot of paternal deity,

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:10.092
gets in Dad's car and proceeds
to put a decisive end to the

00:28:10.092 --> 00:28:14.818
battle with the rebel angels.
This is what Raphael tells

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:17.466
Adam:
The overthrown he rais'd,

00:28:17.466 --> 00:28:20.438
and as a Herd
Of Goats or timorous flock

00:28:20.438 --> 00:28:23.473
together throng'd
Drove them before him

00:28:23.473 --> 00:28:25.329
Thunder-struck,
pursu'd

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.609
With terrors,
and with furies to the bounds

00:28:27.609 --> 00:28:30.599
And Crystal wall of
Heav'n...

00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:34.730
It's at this terrible moment of
being thunderstruck by the

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.426
awesome power of the Son that
the rebel angels throw

00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:42.339
themselves headlong down from
the verge of heaven.

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:45.619
This is obviously an
unbelievably consequential

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:48.970
moment -- this is the moment of
Satan's fall.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:53.861
I think there's got to be a
point to Milton's recycling and

00:28:53.861 --> 00:28:57.558
repeating of this word,
this striking word from

00:28:57.558 --> 00:29:00.112
Paradise Lost,
in the new poem,

00:29:00.112 --> 00:29:03.492
Paradise Regained.
I think he's signaling some

00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:06.269
kind of connection between the
horrifying moment,

00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:10.027
from Satan's perspective,
of the Son's victory over the

00:29:10.027 --> 00:29:13.924
fallen rebel angels in the
earlier poem and the Son's new

00:29:13.924 --> 00:29:16.552
victory,
or what's about to be his new

00:29:16.552 --> 00:29:19.519
victory, over Satan that begins
at this moment,

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:22.308
centuries later,
at the Son's baptism.Milton

00:29:22.308 --> 00:29:25.986
alludes to that climactic moment
in Paradise Lost but on

00:29:25.986 --> 00:29:29.250
some level this is an allusion
that the later poem,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.099
Paradise Regained,
doesn't know what to do with

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:35.932
and, in fact,
never really does anything

00:29:35.932 --> 00:29:38.680
explicit with.
Satan is thunderstruck at the

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.113
baptism just as he was
thunderstruck at the war in

00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:43.943
heaven,
but Satan himself is incapable

00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:48.844
-- and this is just ingenious on
Milton's part -- he's incapable

00:29:48.844 --> 00:29:53.279
of understanding how these two
moments might be in any way

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:57.480
related.I don't know what
kind of television,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.359
if any, you all watch.
But I do know that -- not when

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:06.559
I was an undergraduate because
we got such terrible reception

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:09.795
in the days before cable,
but when I was a graduate

00:30:09.795 --> 00:30:12.855
student and living off campus
and I had cable television -- I

00:30:12.855 --> 00:30:15.813
spent an inordinate amount of
time watching soap [laughter]

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:19.496
operas during the day.
It was a way not to write my

00:30:19.496 --> 00:30:23.647
dissertation.
If you've spent as much time as

00:30:23.647 --> 00:30:28.579
I have watching thousands of
hours of soap operas,

00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:30.240
[laughter]
you know what it means to be

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.207
thunderstruck,
which is something I take it to

00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:34.480
be closely related to being
struck by lightning.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.295
At least in the 1970s and in
the ‘80s,

00:30:37.295 --> 00:30:40.962
there is a point in almost
every soap opera at least once

00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:44.432
every two or three years in
which someone is struck by

00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:45.974
lightning,
[laughter]

00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:48.049
and the consequence is
invariably the same:

00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:51.579
it's the condition of amnesia.
Soap operas obviously couldn't

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:54.809
survive without some recourse to
the amnesia plot,

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:58.466
the lightning-striking plot,
because it's a way to keep all

00:30:58.466 --> 00:31:00.483
of the actors intact but
[laughs]

00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:03.509
reconfigure and spice up a lot
of the plots,

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:08.058
where the same actor gets to be
someone completely new because

00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:12.456
he has to develop an entirely
new life and new relationships

00:31:12.456 --> 00:31:16.632
with all of the preexisting
actors and cast members.I

00:31:16.632 --> 00:31:21.254
think it's something very close
to amnesia that Satan is struck

00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:25.430
with at this moment in
Paradise Regained.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:30.016
It's as if Satan has at this
very moment repressed any memory

00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:33.150
of his first having been
thunderstruck.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.510
He has completely forgotten
about the Son's role in the war

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.022
in heaven, and I actually have
to be more specific than that:

00:31:42.022 --> 00:31:46.382
Satan is incapable of applying
to the current situation any

00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:51.269
memory of who it was who had
beat him in the war in heaven.

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.756
He has repressed the present
significance that is significant

00:31:55.756 --> 00:31:59.720
for the present moment of the
Son of God's victory,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.596
and it's the nature of this
repression, I think,

00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:06.392
which is at the very center of
Paradise Regained.The

00:32:06.392 --> 00:32:10.064
central advance that this poem
has made over Paradise Lost

00:32:10.064 --> 00:32:13.860
is its refusal to represent
traditional epic action.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.900
There's no big battle here.
There's no war.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.039
There's no huge fight in which
the woman's seed,

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:23.902
Christ, bruises Satan's head.
There's really actually no

00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:27.363
overt action at all.
The hero quite simply does

00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.230
nothing and he just keeps saying
no.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.520
Whatever action this text
presents to us is clearly

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.351
psychological,
and the psychological problem

00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:40.234
that I think overwhelms all of
the characters in Paradise

00:32:40.234 --> 00:32:43.920
Regained is the simple fact
that they cannot [laughs]

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.803
manage for the life of them to
relate the current story that

00:32:47.803 --> 00:32:51.950
they're inhabiting to the events
of Paradise Lost.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.478
They have forgotten
Paradise Lost.Now,

00:32:56.478 --> 00:33:01.616
let me ask you to think about
the dramatic situation of this

00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:04.669
poem.
Satan knows perfectly well that

00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:08.988
God has prophesied that one of
his sons will rise up one day

00:33:08.988 --> 00:33:12.368
and destroy him.
He knows that this is going to

00:33:12.368 --> 00:33:15.881
happen, and he's very clear
about the certainty of the

00:33:15.881 --> 00:33:19.895
prophecy from Genesis 3:15.
Satan even knows that it is

00:33:19.895 --> 00:33:24.472
this man named Jesus who's being
baptized now who will one day

00:33:24.472 --> 00:33:29.199
destroy him and who will one day
be responsible for bruising his

00:33:29.199 --> 00:33:31.992
head;
but Satan seems for some reason

00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:35.089
to have no way of knowing that
the Son of God,

00:33:35.089 --> 00:33:38.574
who will at some point in the
future be responsible for his

00:33:38.574 --> 00:33:42.359
doom, is the same Son of God who
had devastated all of the rebel

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:44.436
angels,
and Satan himself of course,

00:33:44.436 --> 00:33:47.060
in the war in heaven.
Satan has no way of knowing

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.583
that the prophesied Messiah that
he's dealing with now will turn

00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:53.962
out to be the Son of God,
the first begotten.He has

00:33:53.962 --> 00:33:57.150
no way of knowing that the
Messiah will be that same

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.713
absolutely insufferable angel
whom the Heavenly Father had

00:34:00.713 --> 00:34:04.526
promoted so arbitrarily and so
ostentatiously above all of the

00:34:04.526 --> 00:34:07.839
other angels in Book Five of
Paradise Lost.

00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:12.241
The traumatic scene of that
exaltation, "This day I have

00:34:12.241 --> 00:34:15.477
begot…
/ My only Son," "[T]o him shall

00:34:15.477 --> 00:34:18.550
bow / All knees in
Heav'n…," "[H]im who

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.852
disobeys / Mee disobeys" -- you
remember all of those thundering

00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:26.612
words of the Father.
Satan is incapable of relating

00:34:26.612 --> 00:34:29.760
that traumatic scene to this
traumatic scene,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.454
the traumatic scene that he's
witnessing now,

00:34:32.454 --> 00:34:36.067
the "this is my beloved Son" at
the baptism.Look at what

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:39.679
Satan says -- it's excruciating
and it makes us squirm,

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.860
I think -- at the top of page
485.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.280
This is Book One,
line eighty-nine.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.674
Satan is trying to figure out
what God meant by his strange

00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:54.513
utterance at the baptism.
You can see Satan coming so

00:34:54.513 --> 00:34:58.168
close to an understanding,
but he can't seem to make the

00:34:58.168 --> 00:35:00.582
final logical leap,
and it's a leap,

00:35:00.582 --> 00:35:04.035
of course, that I think we all
feel confident that we would

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.840
have made or been able to make.
Line eighty-nine;

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.406
this is Satan:
"His first-begot we know,

00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:11.183
and sore have felt,
[laughs]

00:35:11.183 --> 00:35:13.421
he's remembering the war in
heaven]

00:35:13.421 --> 00:35:16.909
/ When his fierce thunder drove
us to the deep;

00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:20.809
/ Who this is we must
learn…"

00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:23.307
So he's able to remember the
sensation of being thunderstruck

00:35:23.307 --> 00:35:26.553
in Paradise Lost,
 but he can't connect it

00:35:26.553 --> 00:35:30.739
with the thunderous proclamation
of the Son at the baptism.

00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:35.992
It's as if we have a failure of
the synaptic nerves in Satan's

00:35:35.992 --> 00:35:40.900
brain and he can't make what
seems to be to us the obvious

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.066
cognitive link.I think his
inability to make that link is

00:35:46.066 --> 00:35:49.252
surprising,
but we have to understand that

00:35:49.252 --> 00:35:52.129
Satan has been traumatized.
It's as if the war in heaven

00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:54.805
had produced in Satan something
like a post-traumatic stress

00:35:54.805 --> 00:35:58.065
disorder,
and the nature of this disorder

00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:01.307
is his -- well,
I think it's perfectly

00:36:01.307 --> 00:36:05.949
understandable in just simple
psychological terms.

00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:09.649
You'll remember that the
original motive for Satan's fall

00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:13.348
was the Father's exultation of
his beloved Son -- his now

00:36:13.348 --> 00:36:17.047
beloved Son above all of the
other angels -- and that the

00:36:17.047 --> 00:36:20.746
resulting sibling rivalry was
the spur for all of Satan's

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:24.686
later actions.
The dilemma of sibling rivalry

00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:29.079
is at the heart of Paradise
Regained as well,

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:32.829
but sibling rivalry in this
poem exists solely as a

00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:35.679
phenomenon that has to be
repressed.

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:39.299
Satan simply cannot and will
not make the cognitive

00:36:39.299 --> 00:36:42.918
connection between the rivalry
he feels now to this

00:36:42.918 --> 00:36:46.610
Messiah-character and the one
that he had felt,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.724
that primal,
originary rivalry that had

00:36:48.724 --> 00:36:51.840
proven so devastating in
Paradise Lost.Now,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.577
we may feel that we can
understand on psychological

00:36:54.577 --> 00:36:57.642
grounds the reason for Satan's
inability to read the full

00:36:57.642 --> 00:37:00.380
meaning of God's pronouncement
at the baptism,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:07.792
but I think the true genius of
Milton's poem is the fact that

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:12.610
the Son is just as clueless as
Satan.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:17.137
The Son has even less memory,
in fact, than Satan about his

00:37:17.137 --> 00:37:21.037
former activities in heaven.
The Son can't even begin to

00:37:21.037 --> 00:37:24.671
reconstruct what had happened in
Paradise Lost because in

00:37:24.671 --> 00:37:28.730
assuming his earthly mantle,
he seems to have suffered a

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:33.186
much greater and much more
severe case of amnesia than

00:37:33.186 --> 00:37:35.920
Satan had.
I think it's this image of

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.265
amnesia, or of some kind of
repression or some sort of

00:37:39.265 --> 00:37:42.099
pathological forgetting,
that may provide the most

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:44.990
useful way of thinking about the
relation of Paradise Regained

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.072
to the earlier poem,
Paradise Lost.Now,

00:37:48.072 --> 00:37:51.090
let's think about it from
another perspective.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:53.496
In writing Paradise
Regained,

00:37:53.496 --> 00:37:57.414
Milton has clearly had to
repress everything that had been

00:37:57.414 --> 00:37:59.756
-- well,
not everything but pretty much

00:37:59.756 --> 00:38:02.840
everything -- that had been so
liberating, so revolutionary,

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.630
and so remarkable about
Paradise Lost.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.506
Now it might be tempting to
argue, and it of course has been

00:38:10.506 --> 00:38:13.891
argued, that Milton is just
getting old and he's getting

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:17.030
tired and he's not up to all
those similes now,

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.717
but Milton has severed from his
verse all of that luxuriant

00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:23.070
ornamentation for a deliberate
and,

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.210
I think, a very important
reason.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:29.129
He's purging his verse of what
we now take to be its

00:38:29.129 --> 00:38:31.820
characteristic beauty because
he,

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.058
too, like Satan and like the
Son, is struggling to forget

00:38:37.058 --> 00:38:40.581
Paradise Lost.
I think there's an important

00:38:40.581 --> 00:38:43.277
sense in which Milton is
thinking of the beautiful verse

00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:46.315
style of Paradise Lost as
something like a temptation in

00:38:46.315 --> 00:38:48.737
this poem,
and it's a temptation that he

00:38:48.737 --> 00:38:50.982
has to resist.
Look at the scene of the

00:38:50.982 --> 00:38:53.090
second temptation in Paradise
Regained.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:55.930
This is page 500 of the
Hughes.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:04.020
This is Book Two, line 289.
The Son is beginning to get

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.743
hungry, understandably,
after his forty days in the

00:39:07.743 --> 00:39:11.467
wilderness, and he enters a
pleasant grove where he

00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:15.424
encounters Satan:
Only in a bottom [this is

00:39:15.424 --> 00:39:18.610
line 289 of Book Two]
saw a pleasant Grove,

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.889
With chant of tuneful Birds
resounding loud,

00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:25.409
Thither he bent his way,
determin'd there

00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:30.210
To rest at noon,
and enter'd soon the shade,

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.530
High rooft, and walks beneath,
and alleys brown

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.980
That open'd in the midst a
woody Scene;

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.619
Nature's own work it seem'd
(Nature taught Art)

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:42.710
And to a Superstitious eye the
haunt

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.710
Of Wood Gods and Wood
Nymphs…

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.714
I think this pretty little
landscape that we have here is

00:39:50.714 --> 00:39:53.289
rather jarring in the context of
the reserved,

00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:55.675
the sparing,
pleasures typically afforded us

00:39:55.675 --> 00:39:59.262
in Paradise Regained.
It's jarring because this

00:39:59.262 --> 00:40:03.644
pleasant grove reminds us,
I think, in so many ways of the

00:40:03.644 --> 00:40:06.719
Garden of Eden from Paradise
Lost.

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:10.458
Milton's description here
is, in fact, a tissue of echoes

00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:14.258
from Book Four of Paradise
Lost where Eden opens onto a

00:40:14.258 --> 00:40:18.310
woody theater,
just as this grove opens onto a

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.604
woody scene.
This grove seems to appear to

00:40:21.604 --> 00:40:25.377
possess wood gods and wood
nymphs much as the verse of

00:40:25.377 --> 00:40:29.576
Paradise Lost was filled
with the allusions to all of

00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:33.563
those classical presences that
Milton had culled from his

00:40:33.563 --> 00:40:36.980
lifetime of reading classical
literature.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.770
But here the deities of pagan
literature are branded as

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.929
superstition -- "thus they
relate, erring."

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:47.738
All of those elements,
those aesthetic elements that

00:40:47.738 --> 00:40:50.949
had made Paradise Lost so
lovable,

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:53.903
so engaging,
and so enticing are now branded

00:40:53.903 --> 00:40:58.093
as a temptation.It's as if
the Son were being tempted with

00:40:58.093 --> 00:41:02.352
something like the literature of
Paradise Lost when he's

00:41:02.352 --> 00:41:06.130
presented with this opportunity
-- that he takes,

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.449
by the way -- to enter this
grove.

00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:13.088
It's important that the Son
willingly enters this pleasant

00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:17.402
grove that has been so carefully
fashioned, of course,

00:41:17.402 --> 00:41:20.405
by Satan.
Readers of this poem rightly

00:41:20.405 --> 00:41:24.297
are always shocked by this
moment because this is the Son

00:41:24.297 --> 00:41:26.935
of God here,
after all, and he's the very

00:41:26.935 --> 00:41:30.353
picture of virtue and of perfect
reason -- and he's made this

00:41:30.353 --> 00:41:33.556
unbelievably stupid mistake.
This is like the mistake that

00:41:33.556 --> 00:41:36.579
the Red Cross Knight makes in
the first canto of The Faerie

00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:38.659
Queene, entering the wood of
error.

00:41:38.659 --> 00:41:42.185
The beauty of paradise,
and by extension the beauty of

00:41:42.185 --> 00:41:44.780
Paradise Lost,
is so tempting,

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.503
we could say,
that even the Son of God feels

00:41:48.503 --> 00:41:52.659
its overwhelming magnetic
pull.Yet Milton,

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:57.418
I think, is still working
consciously here to renounce all

00:41:57.418 --> 00:42:02.093
of that extraordinary poetic
license that he had taken in

00:42:02.093 --> 00:42:06.939
Paradise Lost.
This new poem explores in more

00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:12.550
depth and with more insight the
merit and the beauty of poetic

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:16.690
renunciation than any other poem
ever has.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.038
I'm convinced of that.
This is a poem all about denial

00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:22.716
and repression,
and its deepest and most

00:42:22.716 --> 00:42:26.150
powerful meanings emerge not
through our sense,

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.385
I think, of what the poem
offers but our sense of what

00:42:30.385 --> 00:42:34.381
it's not offering or what it
won't permit itself to

00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:37.222
offer.Now,
there's an obvious and explicit

00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:39.711
way in which Paradise
Regained is about this kind

00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:42.085
of negation,
or this renunciation,

00:42:42.085 --> 00:42:45.130
of Paradise Lost.
Paradise Lost was about

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.780
man's first disobedience and the
new poem, Paradise

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.764
Regained,
reverses that situation and

00:42:50.764 --> 00:42:54.809
treats another man's unswerving
obedience to God,

00:42:54.809 --> 00:42:58.935
an obedience so severe that at
times I think it strikes us as

00:42:58.935 --> 00:43:02.577
unthinking or unreflective.
That's just the obvious way in

00:43:02.577 --> 00:43:05.707
which Paradise Regained
works to negate or undo the

00:43:05.707 --> 00:43:08.827
effects of Paradise Lost,
but there's another,

00:43:08.827 --> 00:43:12.059
there's a more significant,
way in which Milton's later

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:15.771
poem attempts to forge some kind
of connection with the earlier

00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:18.645
one.
Milton in the new poem is

00:43:18.645 --> 00:43:23.968
acutely aware of his already
having written the great epic

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:30.039
Paradise Lost and with
this intense self-consciousness.

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:34.510
It's an entirely new neurotic
burden for Milton.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.267
Paradise Regained takes
up the problem that had proven

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:41.650
so difficult and so troubling to
the younger Milton,

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.640
and he takes it up once again
but, of course,

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.489
with a twist -- and this is the
problem of the poet's career.

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:49.146
It's as if Milton can stand
back now and review the

00:43:49.146 --> 00:43:52.174
autobiographical narrative he
had written for himself as a

00:43:52.174 --> 00:43:55.468
young man and take stock in what
he's accomplished.So think

00:43:55.468 --> 00:43:58.549
of the basic situation that the
Son of God finds himself in

00:43:58.549 --> 00:44:01.873
Paradise Regained.
Even before the remarkable

00:44:01.873 --> 00:44:05.620
moment of God's pronouncement at
the baptism, Jesus had grown up

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.949
with the knowledge of his future
role as the Messiah.

00:44:08.949 --> 00:44:14.431
His mother had told him,
Mary had told him when he was a

00:44:14.431 --> 00:44:19.348
young boy of what he was to be.
He had at a very early age a

00:44:19.348 --> 00:44:23.011
sense of the important work that
he would perform at some future

00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:25.602
point in time,
but he didn't know exactly what

00:44:25.602 --> 00:44:27.360
that work was going to look
like.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.715
He didn't have a clue as to
when he was actually supposed to

00:44:31.715 --> 00:44:35.278
begin his work.
In short, the Son of God had

00:44:35.278 --> 00:44:40.142
before him a narrative of his
career long before he was able

00:44:40.142 --> 00:44:44.181
to imagine just how that
narrative was going to be

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:49.869
fleshed out.If this problem
sounds a little familiar to you,

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:51.989
that's of course because it is
familiar.

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:56.556
This is precisely the position
that the young Milton had found

00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:59.476
himself in.
He had declared at a very early

00:44:59.476 --> 00:45:03.493
age that he was chosen by God to
write a poem that his countrymen

00:45:03.493 --> 00:45:07.398
would not willingly let die.
He was going to be England's

00:45:07.398 --> 00:45:10.545
literary Messiah,
but that was years before he

00:45:10.545 --> 00:45:14.742
knew what he was supposed to be
writing about or even when he

00:45:14.742 --> 00:45:18.718
was supposed to begin writing.
As he says in Paradise

00:45:18.718 --> 00:45:22.570
Lost, he was "long in
choosing and beginning late."

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:28.116
This is exactly the position
that the Son of God finds

00:45:28.116 --> 00:45:34.082
himself in in Paradise
Regained.Look at the top

00:45:34.082 --> 00:45:37.849
of page 487, Book One,
line 183.

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:43.530
This is the Son of God trying
to figure out what the Father

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.612
must have meant at the baptism:
Meanwhile the Son of God,

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:51.015
who yet some days
Lodg'd in Bethabara,

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:55.115
where John baptiz'd,
Musing and much revolving in

00:45:55.115 --> 00:45:58.050
his breast,
How best the mighty work he

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:00.955
might begin
Of Savior to mankind,

00:46:00.955 --> 00:46:05.789
and which way first
Publish his Godlike office now

00:46:05.789 --> 00:46:09.761
mature…
Now, if we read this passage

00:46:09.761 --> 00:46:12.890
with any sense at all,
or with any knowledge,

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.807
of its author,
I think that this moment as

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:21.420
seen from the life of Christ --
I don't know.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.789
It's completely absurd.
It's a ridiculous situation.

00:46:24.789 --> 00:46:29.037
You have Jesus thinking:
"I'm supposed to be the savior

00:46:29.037 --> 00:46:30.810
of mankind.
Let me think.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.289
What should I do first?
I'm really confused here."

00:46:34.289 --> 00:46:40.334
No one else has ever and would
ever imagine such a scene of a

00:46:40.334 --> 00:46:46.478
kind of career anxiety in some
sort of narrative involving the

00:46:46.478 --> 00:46:50.132
Son of God.
It's laughable to think of the

00:46:50.132 --> 00:46:53.918
Son of God as undergoing
something like a career panic

00:46:53.918 --> 00:46:58.489
attack.But this passage is
very different and it assumes,

00:46:58.489 --> 00:47:02.161
I think, an extraordinary
degree of significance when it's

00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:05.769
placed in the context of
Milton's own ongoing ruminations

00:47:05.769 --> 00:47:09.753
about his own career.
The Son is asking himself how

00:47:09.753 --> 00:47:13.354
he should publish,
how he should make public,

00:47:13.354 --> 00:47:17.610
the godlike office into which
he has now matured.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:21.657
I think it's impossible not to
hear in these lines the

00:47:21.657 --> 00:47:25.933
analogous concern that Milton
had himself revolved in his

00:47:25.933 --> 00:47:30.439
breast when he was pondering
when he should publish or bring

00:47:30.439 --> 00:47:34.945
into print the fruits of what he
knew was his godlike poetic

00:47:34.945 --> 00:47:39.679
talent.So I want to conclude
with this suggestion,

00:47:39.679 --> 00:47:43.911
the suggestion that Milton has
transposed the narrative -- this

00:47:43.911 --> 00:47:48.143
is only one of the myriad things
that he's doing in Paradise

00:47:48.143 --> 00:47:52.375
Regained -- he's transposed
the narrative of his own poetic

00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:56.539
development onto the development
of the Son's sense of his own

00:47:56.539 --> 00:47:58.580
identity.
By saying this,

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.045
I don't want to suggest that
all Paradise Regained is

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:04.371
an autobiographical poem.
I'm convinced,

00:48:04.371 --> 00:48:06.710
of course, that it is an
autobiographical poem;

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:10.930
but it is first and foremost,
I think, a meditation on the

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.035
problem of autobiography.
Milton is in the amazingly

00:48:15.035 --> 00:48:19.650
peculiar position of having
written his autobiography long

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:23.780
before he'd actually lived the
bulk of his life.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.859
That's what all those career
narratives were doing that he

00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:32.462
had penned in the early 1640s.
How do you actually live a

00:48:32.462 --> 00:48:36.110
life, the end of which you
already know?

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:40.510
What's the relation of the
anticipated life narrative to

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.548
the actual experience of living?
These are, of course,

00:48:44.548 --> 00:48:48.190
the questions that plague Adam
and Eve in the last books of

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.643
Paradise Lost as they
learn the future history of

00:48:51.643 --> 00:48:55.347
their descendants but still have
to go about the business of

00:48:55.347 --> 00:48:58.881
living their lives.
These are clearly questions

00:48:58.881 --> 00:49:02.614
that get to the very heart of
Milton's relation to the

00:49:02.614 --> 00:49:05.219
prophecy of his own poetic
talent,

00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:11.422
and they're questions that we
will continue throughout this

00:49:11.422 --> 00:49:17.839
week as we approach the problem
that Milton confronts when he

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:23.679
writes Paradise Regained.
That's this question:

00:49:23.679 --> 00:49:28.320
what does it mean,
after all, to write a sequel to

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.720
the poem that "aftertimes will
not willingly let die"?

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.949
Okay.
I'm going to end there.

00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:40.402
I'm going to ask you to make
sure you will have read all of

00:49:40.402 --> 00:49:43.550
Paradise Regained for
Wednesday.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.550
Okay.

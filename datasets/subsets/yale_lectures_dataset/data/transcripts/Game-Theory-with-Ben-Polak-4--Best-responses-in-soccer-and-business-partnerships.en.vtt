00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.230
Professor Ben Polak: So
last time we introduced a new

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.240
idea and the new idea was that
of best response.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.800
And what was the idea?
The idea was to think of a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.171
strategy that is the best you
can do, given your belief about

00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:17.880
what the other people are doing:
what your opponents are doing,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.073
what other players are doing.
And you could think of this

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:24.377
─ you could think of this
belief as the belief that

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:27.671
rationalizes that choice.
So if you have a boss you might

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:30.001
want to ─
and he or she is going to ask

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.119
you why you chose the action you
did.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.270
If you took a best response to
some believe,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.320
you can say I took this action
because I believed other people

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.433
are going to do this.
And since that was the best you

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.040
could do under that belief,
you'll hopefully keep your job.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.892
I promised that today we would
look at the most important game

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:52.156
in the world.
And, as announced last time,

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:58.080
the most important game is the
penalty kick game.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.731
So this is a game that occurs
in soccer and just to give an

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.697
idea of how important it is for
those people who are unfortunate

00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:08.090
enough not to be soccer fans
here,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.760
the last World Cup was decided
on penalty kicks.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.141
In England's case,
England goes out of every

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.075
single World Cup and every
single European competition

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:20.180
because it loses on penalty
kicks,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.760
usually to Germany,
it has to be said.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.776
And more immediately,
this weekend,

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:28.157
as all of you are thinking the
most event in the world was

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:31.420
whatever was happening in
Congress to do with Iraq,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.552
actually, the most important
event in the world was taking

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.860
place in England where my
favorite team,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.188
Portsmouth, were playing Kaj,
the head TA's favorite team,

00:01:41.188 --> 00:01:43.315
Liverpool.
And, about a third of a way

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:45.565
through that game there was a
penalty, and …

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:47.410
I'll let you know what happened
later.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.458
So keep at the back of your
mind that the real world example

00:01:53.458 --> 00:02:00.019
that matters here is Portsmouth
versus Liverpool this weekend.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.254
(Kaj, the head TA is
Scandinavian so I've got no idea

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.930
why he's supporting Liverpool
anyway,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.208
but I think maybe he spells it
like this or something like

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:13.691
this).
So what we're going to do is

00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:16.667
we're going to look at some
numbers that are approximately

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.695
the probabilities of scoring
when you kick the penalty kick

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:22.283
in different directions.
But just make sure everyone

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.310
─ do I need to explain
what's going on here?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.919
Is everyone familiar with this
situation?

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.520
There's one guy who's going to
run up and kick the ball.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.150
The goal keeper is standing at
the goal.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.890
And their aim is to kick it
into the goal.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.720
That's probably enough.
You've all seen this right?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.830
If you haven't seen this,
go see it.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.638
I mean come on!
So things you should do in

00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:44.590
life: read Shakespeare and see a
soccer game.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.294
So the rough numbers for this
are as follows ─

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:50.316
and actually later on in the
class I'll give you some more

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:54.289
accurate numbers,
but these will do for now.

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.541
There are three ways,
the goal─

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:58.729
the attacker could kick the
ball.

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.849
He could kick the ball to the
left, the middle,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.029
or the right.
And I shouldn't just say he

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.566
here of course,
I mean this is he or she but if

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:08.599
I get that wrong going on,
please forgive me for it.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.430
The goalie can dive to the left
or the right.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.889
In principle the goalie could
stay in the middle.

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.419
We'll come back and talk about
that later.

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:22.124
So this is the guy who is
shooting, he's called the

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:27.450
shooter and this is the goalie.
These are roughly ─

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.071
well, let me put up the payoffs
for this game and then I'll

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.575
explain them.
So you'll notice that I'm just

00:03:34.575 --> 00:03:39.837
going to put in numbers here and
then the negative of the number

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:43.930
and the numbers are roughly like
this: (4,-4).

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.024
So the numbers are (4,
-4), (9, -9),

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.852
(6, -6), (6,
-6), (9, -9) and (4,

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:52.757
-4).
And the idea here is that the

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:57.455
number 4 represents 40% chance
of scoring if you shoot the ball

00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:02.379
to the left of the goal and the
goal keeper dives to the left.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.598
So the payoff here is something
like u_1(left) if the

00:04:07.598 --> 00:04:11.469
goal keeper dives to the left is
equal to 4,

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:20.509
by which I mean there's a 40%
chance of scoring.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.344
So the number for the--The
payoff for the shooter is his

00:04:23.344 --> 00:04:26.384
probability of scoring and the
payoff for the goal keeper is

00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:30.720
just the negative of that.
Let's keep things simple.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.990
As I said before,
for now we'll ignore the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.980
possibility that the goal keeper
could stay put.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.879
So how should we start
analyzing this important game?

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.313
Well we start with the ideas we
learned already several weeks

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:47.346
ago now, or more than a week
ago, which is the idea of

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:51.473
dominant strategies.
Does either player here have a

00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:55.087
dominated strategy?
Does either player have a

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:58.206
dominated strategy?
No, it's kind of clear that

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.242
they don't.
Let's just look at the shooter,

00:05:00.242 --> 00:05:04.105
for example.
So you might think that maybe

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:09.838
middle dominates left,
but notice that middle has a

00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:16.259
higher payoff against left than
shooting to the left.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.120
It has as lower payoff if the
goalie dives to the right.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.587
So, not surprisingly in this
game, it turns out,

00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:25.894
that if the goalie dived to the
left you're best off shooting to

00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:28.014
the right,
second best off shooting to the

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:29.980
middle, and worst off shooting
to the left.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.819
That's if the goalie dives to
the left.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.408
And if the goalie dives to the
right, you're best off shooting

00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:36.699
to the left, second best off
shooting to the middle,

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.760
and worst off by shooting to
the right;

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.924
and that's kind of common sense.
Okay, so if we had stopped the

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:47.731
class after the first week where
all we learned to do was to

00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.480
delete dominated strategies,
we'd be stuck.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.503
We'd have nothing to say about
this game and as I said before,

00:05:54.503 --> 00:05:57.328
this is the most important
game, so that would be bad news

00:05:57.328 --> 00:05:59.078
for Game Theory.
But luckily,

00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:01.670
we can do a little bit better
than that.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.165
Before I do that,
let's just take a poll of the

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:05.394
class.
How many of you,

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:07.779
if you were playing for,
I guess it's going to be

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.709
America, which is a sad thing to
start with, never mind.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.049
You guys are playing for
America and you're taking this

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:17.449
penalty kick and it's the last
kick in the World Cup,

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.000
how many of you,
show of hands,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.569
how many of you would shoot to
the left?

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.980
How many of you would shoot to
the middle?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.740
How many of you would shoot to
the right?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.870
We've got kind of an even split
there, pretty much an even

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.409
split.
We're going to assume these are

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.472
the correct numbers and we're
going to see if that even split

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.667
is really a good idea or not.
So how should we go about

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:47.481
thinking about this?
What I suggest we do is we do

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:52.977
what we did last time and we
start to draw a picture to

00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:57.149
figure out what my expected
payoff is,

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.800
depending on what I believe the
goalie is going to do.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.949
So this is the same kind of
picture we drew last time.

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.840
So on the horizontal axis is my
belief, and my belief is

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.620
essentially the probability that
the goalie dives to the right.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.394
Now as I did last time,
let me put in two axes to make

00:07:19.394 --> 00:07:22.100
the picture a little easier to
draw.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.700
So this is 0 and this is 1.
And you probably have lines in

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.030
your notes but I don't,
so let me just help myself a

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.465
bit.
So this is 2,4,

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:44.136
6,8, 10, so this is going to be
2,4, 6,8, and 10 and over here

00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:52.029
2,4, 6,8, and 10,2,
4,6, 8, and 10.

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:54.370
This would be the basis of my
picture.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.690
So it starts with a possibility
of shooting to the left.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:08.007
Let's do this in red.
So I shoot to the left and the

00:08:08.007 --> 00:08:14.170
goalie dives to the left,
my payoff is what?

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.645
It's 4.
If I shoot to the left and

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.379
there's no probability of the
goalie diving to the right,

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:25.074
which means that they dive to
the left, then my payoff is 4,

00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:27.779
meaning I score 40% of the
time.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:31.951
If I shoot to the left and the
goalie dived to the right,

00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:35.750
then I score 90% of the time,
so my payoff is .9.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.700
By the way why is it 90% of the
time and not 100% of the time?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.259
I could miss;
okay, I could miss.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:48.179
That happens rather often it
turns out, well 10% of the time.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.572
So we know this is going to be
a straight line in between,

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:55.789
so let's put this line in.
So what's this?

00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:01.958
It's the expected payoff to
Player I of shooting to the left

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:08.336
as it depends on the probability
that the goal keeper dives to

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:10.939
the right.
And conversely,

00:09:10.939 --> 00:09:14.889
we can put in …
well let's do them in order.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:18.980
So middle: so if I shoot to the
middle and the goal keeper dives

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.595
to the left,
then my payoff is .6,

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:25.899
is 6, or I score .6 of the
time, and if I shoot to the

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.772
middle and the goalie dives to
the right I still score 60% of

00:09:30.772 --> 00:09:34.488
the time,
so once again it's a straight

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:38.305
line in between.
So this line represents the

00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:43.513
expected payoff of shooting to
the middle as a function of the

00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:48.210
probability that the goal keeper
dives to the right.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.412
Finally ─
let's do it in green ─

00:09:50.412 --> 00:09:52.615
let's look at the payoffs,
expected payoffs,

00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:56.019
if I shoot to the right.
So if I shoot to the right and

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:59.828
the goalie dives to the left,
then I score with probability

00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:03.587
.9, or my payoff is 9.
Conversely, if I shoot to the

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:08.113
right and he or she dives to the
right, then I score 40% of the

00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:13.334
time, so here's my payoff .4.
And here's my green line

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:18.864
representing my expected payoff
as the shooter,

00:10:18.864 --> 00:10:23.952
from shooting to the right,
as a function of the

00:10:23.952 --> 00:10:27.509
probability that the goalie
dives to the right.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:29.279
Did everyone understand how I
constructed this picture?

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:35.779
Easier picture than the one we
constructed last time.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:38.090
So what does everyone notice
from this picture?

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.235
What's the first thing that
jumps out at you from this

00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:42.424
picture?
Assuming these numbers are

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:45.650
true, what jumps out at you from
this picture?

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.760
Can we get some mikes up here?
So Ale, can we get this guy?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.940
Stand up first, the guy in red.
What's your name?

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.620
Don't hold the mike;
just shout.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.363
Student: There's no
point at which the 6,

00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.750
at which it shooting in the
middle gets a higher payoff.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.230
Professor Ben Polak:
Exactly, exactly.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.742
So the thing that I hope jumps
out at you from this picture is

00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:12.139
(no great guesses about figuring
out this is a ½),

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.582
so if the probability that the
goalie's going to jump to the

00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:19.708
right is less than a ½,
then the best you can do is

00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:24.809
represented by this green line,
which is shoot to the right.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.441
So the goalie is going to shoot
to the right with the

00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:27.539
probability less than a
½,

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:29.159
sorry he's going to dive to the
right with the probability less

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:31.559
than a ½,
you should shoot to the right.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.495
Conversely, if you think the
goalie's going to shoot to the

00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:35.029
right with probability more than
a ½,

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:37.543
then the best you can do is
represented by the pink line,

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:39.070
and that's shooting to the
left,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.755
or if you think the goalie's
going to dive to the right with

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:41.870
the probability more than a
½,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.346
the best you can do,
your best response is to shoot

00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:48.379
to the left.
And there is no belief you

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:53.290
could possibly hold given these
numbers in this game that could

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.410
ever rationalize shooting the
ball to the middle.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:04.294
Is that right?
So no: to say it another way,

00:12:04.294 --> 00:12:12.075
middle is not a best response
to any belief I can hold about

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:16.559
the goal keeper,
to any belief.

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:19.686
So there's a lesson here,
and it's pretty much (just to

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:23.159
make the lesson resonate again):
imagine there you are in the

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:26.202
World Cup,
you're playing for England,

00:12:26.202 --> 00:12:30.169
you have to justify your
actions not only to your

00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:33.909
teammates and your manager,
and your boss,

00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:37.780
but to about 60 million rather
angry fans.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:45.534
What's the lesson here?
I'm hoping it was going to be

00:12:45.534 --> 00:12:53.456
obvious, what's the lesson here?
The lesson is,

00:12:53.456 --> 00:13:08.293
do not shoot to the middle.
Let me qualify that lesson

00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:18.734
slightly, unless you're German.
Germans can do whatever they

00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:21.559
like.
Now, it turns out that about a

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:25.310
third of the game between my
team Portsmouth and Kaj's team

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.350
Liverpool, this weekend there
was a penalty.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.576
Portsmouth had a penalty and
the guy who was going to take

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:35.085
the penalty came up to kick the
penalty and he kicked it to the

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:37.988
middle and it was saved.
So just confirming these

00:13:37.988 --> 00:13:41.393
actions, not only did that spoil
my weekend but it also spoiled

00:13:41.393 --> 00:13:43.920
my opportunity to make fun of
Kaj all week,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.691
so it was really a big deal.
So this weekend a penalty was

00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:50.919
missed exactly by somebody
ignoring this rule.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:54.562
There's a more general lesson
here, and the more general

00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:57.873
lesson is, of course:
do not choose a strategy that

00:13:57.873 --> 00:14:01.779
is never a best response to
anything you could believe.

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:14.939
The more general lesson,
do not choose a strategy that

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:25.120
is never a best response to any
belief.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.495
Notice here,
just to underline something

00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:27.799
which came up at the end last
time,

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:30.800
that doesn't just mean beliefs
of the form, the goalie's going

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.309
to dive left or the goalie's
going to dive right.

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:35.929
It means all probabilities in
between.

00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:38.073
So we're allowing you to,
for example,

00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:41.432
to hold the belief that it's
equally likely that the goalie

00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:44.968
dives left or dives right.
But if there's no belief that

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:47.450
could possibly justify it,
don't do it.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.458
And underlining what arises in
this game, notice that in this

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:55.000
game we're able to eliminate one
of the strategies,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.388
in this case the strategy of
shooting to the middle,

00:14:58.388 --> 00:15:00.779
even though nothing was
dominated.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:03.609
So when we looked at domination
and deleted dominated

00:15:03.609 --> 00:15:06.070
strategies, we got nowhere here.
Here, at least,

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.781
we got somewhere,
we got rid of the idea of

00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:10.405
shooting to the middle.
Now if you can just persuade

00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:13.535
the English and Portsmouth
soccer players of this lesson,

00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:15.809
I'd be very happy.
So before we leave it,

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:18.559
I've been making a point in
this class of coming back to

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.972
reality from time to time,
so this is a very simple model

00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:25.179
of the soccer game in reality.
Let's just try,

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:28.010
any of you on the Yale Soccer
Team?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.607
No?
Have any of you played soccer

00:15:31.607 --> 00:15:33.870
for your college?
One or two.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.716
Have you ever played soccer?
How many of you have ever

00:15:35.716 --> 00:15:37.690
played soccer?
Okay, good I was getting

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.279
worried there for a second.
So, one thing we said last time

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:44.779
was when we put up a model and
try and draw lessons from it,

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:49.690
we should just take a step back
and say, what's missing here?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.897
So let's try and get some kind
of ─ I'll come off the

00:15:51.897 --> 00:15:53.230
stage to make it easier for
Jude.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.673
What's missing here?
What's missing in this model of

00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:59.680
this piece of soccer,
this game within a game?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.845
What's missing here?
Why is this not necessarily a

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:06.480
hundred percent accurate model?
I'll need some mikes up here.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.442
Can you?
You have to really shout

00:16:08.442 --> 00:16:09.690
because you're miles from the
mike there.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.911
Student: You might be
better kicking to the left or to

00:16:11.911 --> 00:16:14.022
the right depending on whether
you're right handed or left

00:16:14.022 --> 00:16:16.049
handed.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:19.169
Good, so one thing that's
clearly missing here is I'm

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:22.710
ignoring that in fact right
footed players find it easier to

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.358
shoot to their left,
which is actually the goalie's

00:16:26.358 --> 00:16:29.672
right.
So right footed players find it

00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:34.844
easier to shoot to the left as
facing, to shoot across the

00:16:34.844 --> 00:16:36.937
goal.
Does everyone confirm that's

00:16:36.937 --> 00:16:38.899
true?
Yeah, anyone ever tried to this?

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:42.334
It's a little easier to hit the
ball hard to the opposite side

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.938
from the side which is your foot
and that's the same principle in

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:48.188
baseball.
It's a little bit easier to

00:16:48.188 --> 00:16:51.563
pull the ball hard then it is to
hit the ball to the opposite

00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:55.769
field.
Yes?

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:58.455
Student: Players don't
make their decision before,

00:16:58.455 --> 00:17:00.230
and then stick with it
necessarily.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.006
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so players are making

00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:04.650
decisions as they're running up.
I think that's okay here, right?

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.503
We can think of this as the
decision happening at the

00:17:07.503 --> 00:17:10.406
instant at which you kicked.
So you're right that you could

00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:12.460
have made your decision back in
the locker room,

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:19.415
or you could have made the
decision at half time,

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:27.385
but ultimately what matters
─ let's hope that goes

00:17:27.385 --> 00:17:31.053
away.
We sure that it's not off my

00:17:31.053 --> 00:17:33.764
mike?
Just in case I'll move my mike

00:17:33.764 --> 00:17:36.467
a bit lower.
So I'm going to shout louder

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:39.609
because my mike is now lower.
It doesn't really matter

00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:41.460
exactly when the decision is
made.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.700
At the end of the day,
the goalie doesn't know the

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.215
decision of the shooter and the
shooter doesn't know the

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:49.809
decision of the goalie.
So it's as if that decision is

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:53.820
made instantaneously as the
shooter is running up.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.590
What else?
Yeah, can we get this.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.790
Tae can you get this guy here?
Stand up.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.285
Shout out.
Student: The goalie

00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:04.581
might stay in the middle.
Professor Ben Polak: The

00:18:04.581 --> 00:18:06.272
goalie might stay in the middle.
That's a good point,

00:18:06.272 --> 00:18:09.329
of course, I've abstracted from
that here, and in fact,

00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:10.818
we'll come back,
I think, I'll try and put that

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:12.340
onto a problem set,
but I think you're right,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.450
it is an issue here.
Anything else?

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.814
Well let me put up some real
numbers and we'll see about how

00:18:23.814 --> 00:18:28.269
much the correspondence to what
we've got here.

00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:31.090
So I gave you some numbers I
made up actually a long time

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.557
ago, but since I've been using
this game in class,

00:18:33.557 --> 00:18:38.096
somebody went out and checked.
And it turns out that ignoring

00:18:38.096 --> 00:18:42.147
middle for a second,
ignoring middle ─

00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:46.907
so these are real numbers,
and these numbers come from a

00:18:46.907 --> 00:18:50.821
paper in the AER by Chiappori
and some co-authors and for

00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:53.853
everyone at Yale,
I'll make that paper available

00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:56.630
to you through JSTORE or through
the Yale Library,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.440
so you can go look at it if
you'd like.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.349
What they worked out was the
following table.

00:19:05.349 --> 00:19:08.920
And again, we need to be a
little bit careful here.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.517
So I'm going to put the left
and right in inverted commas

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:16.436
because actually what they did
was they corrected for people's

00:19:16.436 --> 00:19:19.519
natural direction and not
natural direction.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:23.381
So the idea here is shooting to
the left if you're right footed

00:19:23.381 --> 00:19:26.807
is the natural direction,
so left here means the natural

00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:28.662
direction.
Of course, if you're left

00:19:28.662 --> 00:19:31.099
footed it goes the other way,
but they've corrected for that.

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:40.922
It turns out that the
probabilities of scoring here

00:19:40.922 --> 00:19:46.816
are as follows,
63.6,94.4,89.3,

00:19:46.816 --> 00:19:50.621
and 43.7.
So things are not--I haven't

00:19:50.621 --> 00:19:53.303
given you the numbers for the
middle but--So you can see that

00:19:53.303 --> 00:19:55.978
whoever it was who said,
you're slightly better off,

00:19:55.978 --> 00:19:59.242
you score with slightly higher
probabilities when you kick to

00:19:59.242 --> 00:20:01.309
your natural side is exactly
right.

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:03.173
The thing is still not
dominated and we could still

00:20:03.173 --> 00:20:04.589
have done exactly the same
analysis,

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:07.789
and actually you can see I'm
not very far off in the numbers

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.609
I made up, but things are not
perfectly symmetric.

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:15.090
I forget who it was who said
that, but that does turn out to

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.926
be true.
Certainly the goalie staying

00:20:16.926 --> 00:20:18.694
put is an issue,
as I said we'll deal with that

00:20:18.694 --> 00:20:20.769
in the problem set,
but there's another issue here.

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:23.000
Let me just raise one more
issue.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.645
One more issue is,
you have another decision when

00:20:25.645 --> 00:20:28.622
you run up to hit this,
hit the penalty other than just

00:20:28.622 --> 00:20:30.816
left and right.
Someone whose played the game,

00:20:30.816 --> 00:20:32.460
what's the other decision you
really face?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.404
Can I get the woman here?
What's the other decision you

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.150
face?
Student: You could kick

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.848
up to the top corner.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:41.930
Okay, you can kick up and down,
that's true.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.329
Okay, that's true actually,
that's true.

00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:45.532
But I meant something else,
that's right,

00:20:45.532 --> 00:20:51.100
but I meant something else.
What else is there?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.019
Try this guy here.
Student: Spin.

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:57.390
Professor Ben Polak:
Well that's getting subtle here.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.830
It's a much more basic thing,
what's a more basic thing?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.420
What's a more basic thing here?
Take it, yeah right in front of

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.529
you.
Student: Speed.

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:06.180
Professor Ben Polak:
Speed, right.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.082
So another decision you face is
do you just try and kick this

00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:13.529
ball as hard as you can or do
you try and place it?

00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:16.930
That's probably as important a
decision as placing it,

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.099
as deciding which direction to
hit, and it turns out to matter.

00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:23.546
So, for example,
if you're the kind of person,

00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:25.829
(which is I have to say all I
ever was),

00:21:25.829 --> 00:21:29.305
if you're the kind of person
who can kick the ball fairly

00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:33.042
hard but not very accurately,
then it actually might change

00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.390
these numbers.
If you can kick the ball very

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.210
hard, but not very accurately,
then if you try and shoot to

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.543
the left or right,
you're slightly more likely to

00:21:40.543 --> 00:21:41.777
miss.
On the other hand,

00:21:41.777 --> 00:21:44.101
as you shoot to the middle,
since you're kicking the ball

00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:46.009
hard, you're slightly more
likely to score.

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:50.111
Now, if this all seems like
arcane and irrelevant detail,

00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:53.700
let's just see why this matters
in the picture,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.029
and then we'll leave soccer,
at least for today.

00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:01.001
So if you're the kind of person
who can kick the ball hard but

00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.208
not accurately,
then it's going to lower the

00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:09.390
probabilities of scoring as you
kick towards the right because

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.740
you might miss,
and it's going to lower the

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.584
probability of scoring as you
hit towards the left because

00:22:16.584 --> 00:22:19.775
you're likely to miss,
and it might actually raise the

00:22:19.775 --> 00:22:22.640
probability of your scoring as
you hit towards the middle,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.891
because you hit the ball so
hard it's really pretty hard for

00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.875
the goal keeper to stop it.
Here it goes in the middle,

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:31.698
and if you look carefully
there, I didn't really make it

00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:33.438
clear enough,
you can see,

00:22:33.438 --> 00:22:38.031
suddenly a strategy that looked
crazy shooting to the middle,

00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:40.940
that suddenly started to seem
okay.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.372
It turns out,
if you look at those dotted

00:22:42.372 --> 00:22:43.769
lines, there's an area in the
middle,

00:22:43.769 --> 00:22:48.038
the area between here and here,
this little area here,

00:22:48.038 --> 00:22:52.630
you actually might be just fine
shooting to the middle.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.188
So in reality,
we need to take into account a

00:22:55.188 --> 00:22:57.339
little bit more,
and in particular,

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.309
we need to take into account
the abilities of players to hit

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:02.808
the ball accurately and/or hard.
And if those people,

00:23:02.808 --> 00:23:05.057
if you're interested in that
─ and I realize at this

00:23:05.057 --> 00:23:07.187
point I probably lost the
interest of most Americans in

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:08.982
the room,
but for the non-Americans in

00:23:08.982 --> 00:23:11.467
the room, the people who are
interested in the real world

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:14.251
─ as I said before,
I'll put that article online

00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:17.059
and that goes through all the
gory detail of this.

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:21.470
I should just say that the data
I just gave you is real data but

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.920
it's actually mixed ability
data.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.438
This data comes half from the
Italian league,

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:29.414
which is pretty good and half
from the French league,

00:23:29.414 --> 00:23:34.412
which sucks.
So who knows how much we should

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:38.690
trust it.
Okay, so that was our example

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:44.609
for the day and our first brush
with reality for the day.

00:23:44.609 --> 00:23:46.720
Let's clean the board and do
some work.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.930
Do a bit more formal stuff here.
So here we have an example but

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.882
I want to go back to the
generality and to a bit of

00:23:52.882 --> 00:23:56.804
formalism.
By the way, I should tell you

00:23:56.804 --> 00:24:00.720
that the game ended nil-nil or
0-0.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:07.210
It's a moral victory for me I
think.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.520
So I want to be formal about
these things I've been

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.939
mentioning informally.
And in particular,

00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:16.230
I want to be formal about the
definition of best response.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.735
I'm going to put down two
different definitions of best

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:21.194
response, one of which
corresponds to best response to

00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:23.607
somebody else playing a
particular strategy like left

00:24:23.607 --> 00:24:26.217
and right,
and the other is just going to

00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:29.827
correspond to the more general
idea of a best response to a

00:24:29.827 --> 00:24:32.087
belief.
It'll allow us to use our

00:24:32.087 --> 00:24:35.099
notation and just be a little
bit more nerdy.

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:42.542
So Player i's strategy,
Ŝ_i (there's

00:24:42.542 --> 00:24:51.622
going to be a hat to single it
out) is a best response (always

00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:58.567
abbreviated BR),
to the strategy S_- i

00:24:58.567 --> 00:25:06.245
of the other players if ─
and here's our real excuse to

00:25:06.245 --> 00:25:12.771
use our notation ─
if the payoff from Player i

00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:20.194
from choosing Ŝ_i
against S_- i is

00:25:20.194 --> 00:25:26.976
weakly bigger than her payoff
from choosing some other

00:25:26.976 --> 00:25:31.089
strategy,
S_i',

00:25:31.089 --> 00:25:37.243
against S_- i and
this better hold for all

00:25:37.243 --> 00:25:42.069
S_i' available to
Player i.

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:45.157
So in previous definitions,
we've seen the qualifier,

00:25:45.157 --> 00:25:47.829
for all, be on the other
player's strategy.

00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:50.880
Here, the qualifier for all is
on my strategy.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.944
So strategy Ŝ_i
is a best response to the

00:25:53.944 --> 00:25:57.399
strategy S_- i of the
other players if my payoff from

00:25:57.399 --> 00:26:00.519
choosing Ŝ_i
against S_- i,

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:04.976
is weakly bigger than that from
choosing S_i' against

00:26:04.976 --> 00:26:07.750
S_- i,
and this better hold for all

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.970
possible other strategies i
could choose.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:15.090
There's another way of writing
that, that's kind of useful,

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.063
or equivalently,
Ŝ_i solves the

00:26:19.063 --> 00:26:26.829
following.
It maximizes my payoff against

00:26:26.829 --> 00:26:31.653
S_- i.
So you're all used to,

00:26:31.653 --> 00:26:34.309
I'm hoping everyone is used to
seeing the term max.

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:37.855
As I solve the maximization
problem, how do I maximize my

00:26:37.855 --> 00:26:41.779
payoff given that other people
are choosing S_- i?

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:44.512
Again, for the math phobics in
the room, don't panic,

00:26:44.512 --> 00:26:47.613
this is just writing down in
words what we've already seen a

00:26:47.613 --> 00:26:51.359
couple of times already today,
well today and last time.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:53.688
Let's generalize this
definition a little bit,

00:26:53.688 --> 00:26:56.430
since we want it to allow for
more general beliefs.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.956
So just rewriting,
Player i's strategy,

00:27:01.956 --> 00:27:09.519
same thing, Ŝ_i
is a best response.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:24.142
But now let's be careful,
best response to the belief P

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:33.619
about the other player's
choices,

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:36.442
if ─ and it is going to
look remarkably similar except

00:27:36.442 --> 00:27:38.355
now I'm going to have
expectation ─

00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:40.604
if the expected payoff to
Player i from choosing

00:27:40.604 --> 00:27:45.295
Ŝ_i,
given that she holds this

00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:53.264
belief P, is bigger than her
expected payoff from choosing

00:27:53.264 --> 00:27:58.170
any other strategy,
given she holds this belief P;

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:04.759
and this better hold for all
S_i' that she could

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:06.945
choose.
So very similar idea,

00:28:06.945 --> 00:28:09.726
but the only thing is,
I'm slightly abusing notation

00:28:09.726 --> 00:28:12.835
here by saying that my payoff
depends on my strategy and a

00:28:12.835 --> 00:28:14.572
belief,
but what I really mean is my

00:28:14.572 --> 00:28:18.350
expected payoff.
This is the expectation given

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.678
this belief.
Once again, we can write it the

00:28:23.678 --> 00:28:30.775
other way, or Ŝ_i
solves max when I choose

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:35.894
S_i,
to maximize my expected payoff

00:28:35.894 --> 00:28:40.241
this time from choosing
S_i against

00:28:40.241 --> 00:28:43.205
S_-i.
What do I mean by expected

00:28:43.205 --> 00:28:46.199
payoff?
Just in our example,

00:28:46.199 --> 00:28:52.643
so just to make clear what that
expectation means,

00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:58.684
so for example,
the expected payoff to Player i

00:28:58.684 --> 00:29:06.034
in the game above from choosing
left given she holds the belief

00:29:06.034 --> 00:29:12.910
P is equal to the probability
that the goal keeper dived to

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.225
the left,
times Player i's payoff from

00:29:17.225 --> 00:29:22.535
choosing left against left,
plus the probability that the

00:29:22.535 --> 00:29:27.824
goal keeper dived to the right,
times Player i's expected

00:29:27.824 --> 00:29:31.210
payoff from choosing left
against right.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.938
Okay, so expectation with
respect to P just means exactly

00:29:34.938 --> 00:29:37.897
what you expect it to mean.
So this is a little bit of

00:29:37.897 --> 00:29:40.190
math, a little formality,
but is everyone okay with that?

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.508
I haven't done anything here.
All I've done is write down

00:29:44.508 --> 00:29:49.570
slightly boringly and nerdily,
exactly what we already saw in

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:59.444
a couple of occasions.
Student: [inaudible]

00:29:59.444 --> 00:30:10.660
Professor Ben Polak:
Thank you.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.680
So that right now is going to
seem a little bit like a sudden

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.415
blast of notation,
so let's just remind ourselves

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:20.299
what we really care about is the
idea, it's not the notation,

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:24.102
and let's spend the next half
hour applying these ideas to an

00:30:24.102 --> 00:30:28.051
application.
So this application is not as

00:30:28.051 --> 00:30:33.435
important as soccer,
but it's a bit more Economicsy,

00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:39.980
so I can justify it under the
Economics title of the class.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:56.644
So clearing off my soccer game.
So imagine--What we're going to

00:30:56.644 --> 00:31:01.950
look at is a game involving a
partnership.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.323
So Partnership Game.
And I believe this game is

00:31:05.323 --> 00:31:07.925
covered in some detail in the
Watson textbook,

00:31:07.925 --> 00:31:11.510
or something very close to it
is, if you're having trouble.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.040
The idea is this.
There are two individuals who

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.640
are going to supply an input to
a joint project.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.293
So that could be a firm,
it could be a law firm,

00:31:21.293 --> 00:31:23.439
for example,
and they're going to share

00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:27.249
equally in the profits .
So one example would be a firm

00:31:27.249 --> 00:31:30.295
that they both earn,
sorry, they both own,

00:31:30.295 --> 00:31:34.530
and another example would be
two of you working as a study

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.781
group on my homework assignment.
So they're going to share

00:31:38.781 --> 00:31:42.266
equally in the profits of this
firm, or this joint project,

00:31:42.266 --> 00:31:45.329
but you're going to supply
efforts individually.

00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:47.869
So let's just be a bit more
formal.

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:54.660
So the players are going to be
the two agents and they own this

00:31:54.660 --> 00:32:01.605
firm let's call it.
They own this firm jointly and

00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:08.882
they split the profits,
so they share 50% of the

00:32:08.882 --> 00:32:13.754
profits each.
So it's a profit- sharing

00:32:13.754 --> 00:32:23.821
partnership.
Each agent is going to choose

00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:35.990
her effort level to put into
this firm.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.925
So, it could be that you're
deciding, as a lawyer,

00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:41.920
how many hours you're going to
spend on the job.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.940
So for most of you these
decisions will be a question of

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.455
whether you spend 20 hours a day
at the firm or 21 hours a day at

00:32:48.455 --> 00:32:49.990
the firm,
something like that.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.746
For most of you on your
homework assignments,

00:32:51.746 --> 00:32:54.021
I'm hoping it's a little less
than that, but not much less

00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:56.779
than that.
So the strategy choices,

00:32:56.779 --> 00:33:02.096
we're not going to do it in
hours, let's just normalize and

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:06.130
regard these choices as living
in 0 to 4,

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:12.799
and you can choose any number
of hours between 0 and 4.

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:16.849
Just to mention as we go past
it, a novelty here.

00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:20.246
Every game we've seen in the
class so far has had a discrete

00:33:20.246 --> 00:33:22.363
number of strategies.
Even the game,

00:33:22.363 --> 00:33:24.915
when you chose numbers,
you chose numbers 1,2,

00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:27.750
3,4, 5, up to a 100,
there were 100 strategies.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.480
Here there's a continuum of
strategies.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.630
You could choose any real
number in the interval [0,4].

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.529
So you have a continuum of
possible choices.

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:39.200
That's not going to bother us
but let's point out it's there.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:48.440
So there's a continuum of
strategies.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.548
In principle,
you could bill your clients for

00:33:51.548 --> 00:33:55.009
fractions of a second or
fractions of a minute.

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:58.150
Let's wonder what the firm
profit is given by.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:02.845
So this partnership,
this law firm,

00:34:02.845 --> 00:34:09.336
its profit is given by the
following expression:

00:34:09.336 --> 00:34:17.201
4 times the effort of Player I,
plus the effort of Player II,

00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:22.950
plus a parameter I'll call B,
times the product of their

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.909
efforts.
This is their profit.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.700
And I won't tell you what B is
for now, but let's just--I mean

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.400
I won't tell you exactly what it
is--but I'll explain it.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.780
We'll assume that B lives
between 0 and a 1/4 and it's

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.830
known, I just want to be able to
vary it later.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.319
So what's the idea here?
The idea is Player I directly

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:47.119
contributes profits to the firm
by working, as does Player II.

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:50.699
But they also contribute
through this interaction term.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:54.010
How do we think of that
interaction term?

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.059
How do we think of that term B
S_1 S_2?

00:34:58.059 --> 00:35:01.416
When you're working on your
homework assignments,

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:04.632
if your product,
the thing you hand in was just

00:35:04.632 --> 00:35:07.739
S_1 + S_2,
then you might think what?

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.987
You might think there's no
point working in a study group

00:35:10.987 --> 00:35:13.398
at all.
If the product is just the sum

00:35:13.398 --> 00:35:16.985
or multiple of a sum of the
inputs, there wouldn't be much

00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:19.440
of a point working in a team at
all.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.463
It's the fact you're getting
this extra benefit from working

00:35:22.463 --> 00:35:25.691
with someone else that makes it
worth while working as a team to

00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:27.219
start with.
Is that right?

00:35:27.219 --> 00:35:33.629
So we can think of this term
has to do with complementarity,

00:35:33.629 --> 00:35:39.496
or synergy, a very unpopular
word these days but still:

00:35:39.496 --> 00:35:41.963
synergy.
So we're going to assume that

00:35:41.963 --> 00:35:43.929
when you work together there are
some synergies.

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:45.587
Some of you are good at some
parts of the homework,

00:35:45.587 --> 00:35:47.409
some of them are good at other
parts of the homework.

00:35:47.409 --> 00:35:51.484
And so in this law firm,
one of these guys is an expert

00:35:51.484 --> 00:35:56.540
on intellectual property and the
other one on fraud or something.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:01.369
So I've got the agents.
I've got the strategy set.

00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:02.969
I know something about the
profits of the firm.

00:36:02.969 --> 00:36:05.440
I need to tell you about their
payoffs.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.603
So the payoffs:
the payoff for Player I is

00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:16.522
going to depend,
of course, on her choice and on

00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:21.593
the choice of her partner,
and it's going to equal a

00:36:21.593 --> 00:36:24.283
½--because they're
splitting the profits--so a

00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:27.079
½ of the profits.
So a ½

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:33.214
of 4 times S_1 plus
S_2 plus B S_1

00:36:33.214 --> 00:36:39.574
S_2.
She gets half of those profits

00:36:39.574 --> 00:36:45.400
but it also costs her
S_1 squared.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.673
So S_1 squared is her
effort costs,

00:36:50.673 --> 00:36:56.119
it's her input costs.
This is the effort cost.

00:36:56.119 --> 00:36:59.476
Similarly, Player
II--everything's symmetric

00:36:59.476 --> 00:37:02.989
here--Player II's payoff is the
same thing.

00:37:02.989 --> 00:37:07.186
This term is the same except
we're going to subtract off

00:37:07.186 --> 00:37:11.230
Player II's efforts squared:
S_2 squared.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.848
So you get the profits of the
firm minus the disutility of

00:37:15.848 --> 00:37:19.478
having missed all that sleep.
There's a guy in about the

00:37:19.478 --> 00:37:22.060
fifth row there who's missed too
much sleep, so somebody just

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.880
nudge him.
That's it, good.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.050
We won't put him on camera just
nudge him.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.760
That's it, good.
There you go.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:41.690
Next time we'll use the camera
for that.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.023
So now we have everything we
want to analyze this firm and to

00:37:45.023 --> 00:37:47.190
analyze how things are going to
work,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.124
either when you're working on
your homework assignments or in

00:37:50.124 --> 00:37:52.308
the law partnership.
Again, just to make this

00:37:52.308 --> 00:37:54.478
relevant to you,
I mean this is very stylized of

00:37:54.478 --> 00:37:56.711
course,
but a huge number of businesses

00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:59.968
out there are partnerships and
do have this kind of profit

00:37:59.968 --> 00:38:02.139
sharing rule and do have
synergies.

00:38:02.139 --> 00:38:07.639
So this is a relevant issue in
a lot of businesses.

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:10.547
Now we're going to analyze
this--no secret here--we're

00:38:10.547 --> 00:38:13.619
going to analyze this using the
idea of best response.

00:38:13.619 --> 00:38:16.533
That's not a surprise to any of
you since that's where we

00:38:16.533 --> 00:38:19.147
started the day.
So, in particular,

00:38:19.147 --> 00:38:24.738
I want to figure out what is
Player I's best response to each

00:38:24.738 --> 00:38:29.192
possible choice of Player II?
What is Player I's best

00:38:29.192 --> 00:38:32.775
response for each possible
choice S_2 of Player

00:38:32.775 --> 00:38:36.170
II?
How should I go about doing

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.369
that?
How should I do that?

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:42.088
So here what we did before was
we drew these graphs with

00:38:42.088 --> 00:38:44.927
probabilities,
with beliefs of Player I and

00:38:44.927 --> 00:38:47.858
the problem here is,
previously we had a nice simple

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:50.476
graph to draw because there were
just two strategies for Player

00:38:50.476 --> 00:38:51.445
II.
Player II was a goalie,

00:38:51.445 --> 00:38:52.690
he could dive to the left or
the right.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.322
Problem is here,
that Player II has a continuum

00:38:55.322 --> 00:38:58.926
of strategies and trying to draw
all possible probabilities over

00:38:58.926 --> 00:39:02.188
an infinite number of objects on
the board is more than my

00:39:02.188 --> 00:39:04.730
drawing can do.
Too hard.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.417
So we need some other technique.
How are we going to find out

00:39:08.417 --> 00:39:12.269
Player I's best response?
Somebody?

00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:15.760
Wave your hands in the air,
way back in the corner.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.849
Can I, can we,
let's get the mike.

00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:23.830
Stand up but wait for the mike
to come to you.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.191
How are we going to do it?
How are we going to figure out

00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.190
what Player I's best response
is?

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:32.910
Shout loudly.
Student: [inaudible]

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:39.430
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, okay.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.768
That's certainly the first step.
We've got that,

00:39:42.768 --> 00:39:46.334
actually we've got that.
So here's Player I's payoff as

00:39:46.334 --> 00:39:49.839
a function of what Player II
chooses and what Player I

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:52.219
chooses, so we have that
already.

00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:56.804
We have Player I's payoff as a
function of the two efforts and

00:39:56.804 --> 00:40:01.388
now I want to find out what is
Player I's best efforts given a

00:40:01.388 --> 00:40:04.320
particular choice of
S_2?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.972
Yeah.
Student: Take a

00:40:08.972 --> 00:40:12.144
derivative of S_1.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:40:12.144 --> 00:40:14.911
Good, take a derivative and--
Student: Set it equal to

00:40:14.911 --> 00:40:16.318
zero.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:40:16.318 --> 00:40:18.389
Okay, good.
So we're going to use calculus.

00:40:18.389 --> 00:40:20.940
We're going to use calculus of
one variable.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.110
We're just changing one
variable, S_1.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.791
How many of you--we won't let
the camera see you--how many of

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.920
you have not--I'm not going to
show hands at all.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.345
If you have not seen the
calculus that I'm about to use

00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:35.121
on the board,
or more likely,

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:38.800
if you've forgotten it since
high school, don't panic.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.787
There is a chapter in the back
of the book, I think it's

00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:44.992
chapter 25, that goes over this,
it refreshes your memory of

00:40:44.992 --> 00:40:46.979
such calculus.
And if you haven't,

00:40:46.979 --> 00:40:49.742
if you've never seen it before,
if you haven't taken,

00:40:49.742 --> 00:40:51.814
for example,
the equivalent of Math 112,

00:40:51.814 --> 00:40:54.627
come and see us.
We'll probably try and line up

00:40:54.627 --> 00:40:57.514
a quick calculus lesson,
a special section for those

00:40:57.514 --> 00:41:00.547
people.
So if what I'm going to do now

00:41:00.547 --> 00:41:04.659
is scary, come and see us and
we'll deal with it.

00:41:04.659 --> 00:41:09.507
All right, what I'm going to
do, we want to take a derivative

00:41:09.507 --> 00:41:13.596
of this thing.
What we're going to do is,

00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:18.543
we're asking the question,
what is the maximum,

00:41:18.543 --> 00:41:23.059
choosing S_1,
of this profit.

00:41:23.059 --> 00:41:25.711
Can I multiply the ½
by the 4 just to save myself

00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:28.379
some time?
So the profit is 2

00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:34.416
S_1 plus S_2
plus B S_1

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:39.639
S_2 minus
S_1 squared.

00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:43.965
We're asking the question,
taking S_2 as given,

00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:48.135
what S_1 maximizes
this expression and as the

00:41:48.135 --> 00:41:51.961
gentleman at the back said,
I'm going to differentiate and

00:41:51.961 --> 00:41:54.059
then I'm going to set the thing
equal to 0.

00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:56.130
So I'm almost bound to get this
wrong on the board.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.780
So can you all watch me like a
hawk a second?

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:04.360
So if we differentiate this
object, I'm going to find a

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.080
first order condition in a
second.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.833
All right, so we differentiate.
I'm going to have 2 still,

00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:16.460
and then this S_1 is
going to become a 1,

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:22.000
and this S_1 here is
going to become a plus B

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.309
S_2,
everyone happy with that?

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:31.796
This S_1 squared is
going to become a minus

00:42:31.796 --> 00:42:34.780
2S_1.
That was just differentiating.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.159
Everyone happy with the way I
differentiated?

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:38.280
Is this coming back from high
school?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.772
The cogs are spinning now?
To make this a first order

00:42:42.772 --> 00:42:46.654
condition, I'm going to say "at
the best response," put a hat

00:42:46.654 --> 00:42:51.431
over the 1.
At the best response this is

00:42:51.431 --> 00:42:55.458
equal to 0.
Yeah Tae, can you get the guy

00:42:55.458 --> 00:42:57.281
again.
Student: Wouldn't that

00:42:57.281 --> 00:42:58.489
be 2, oh sorry,
never mind.

00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:00.701
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, you're right to shout out

00:43:00.701 --> 00:43:03.027
because I'm very--I mean doing
it on the board I'm very likely

00:43:03.027 --> 00:43:04.210
to make mistakes,
but okay.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:06.581
So I differentiated this
object, this is my first

00:43:06.581 --> 00:43:08.409
derivative and I set it equal to
0.

00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:10.316
Now in a second I'm going to
work with that,

00:43:10.316 --> 00:43:12.889
but I want to make sure I'm
going to find a maximum and not

00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:15.126
a minimum,
so how do I make sure I'm

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:17.519
finding a maximum and not a
minimum?

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:22.289
I take a look at the second
derivative, which is the second

00:43:22.289 --> 00:43:24.706
order condition.
So I'm going to differentiate

00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:26.320
this object again with respect
to S_1,.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.110
Pretend the hat isn't there a
second.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.804
And none of this has an
S_1 in it,

00:43:29.804 --> 00:43:32.803
so that all goes away.
And I'm going to get minus 2,

00:43:32.803 --> 00:43:36.203
which came from here:
minus 2 and that is in fact

00:43:36.203 --> 00:43:39.320
negative, which is what I wanted
to know.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.613
To find a maximum I want the
second derivative to be

00:43:43.613 --> 00:43:45.645
negative.
So here it is,

00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:48.409
I've got my first order
condition.

00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:53.817
It tells me that the best
response to S_2 is the

00:43:53.817 --> 00:43:57.990
Ŝ_1 that solves
this equation,

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:02.070
that solves this first order
condition.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.775
We can just rewrite that,
if I divide through by 2 and

00:44:05.775 --> 00:44:09.900
rearrange, it's going to tell me
that Ŝ_1,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:18.205
or if you like,
Ŝ_1 is equal to

00:44:18.205 --> 00:44:25.661
1 plus B S_2.
So this thing is equal to

00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:30.889
Player I's best response given
S_2.

00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:34.327
Now I could go through again
and do exactly the same thing

00:44:34.327 --> 00:44:36.859
for Player II,
but I'm not going to do that

00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:40.320
because everything's symmetric.
So everyone happy with that?

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.074
So I could at the same--I could
do the same kind of analysis but

00:44:44.074 --> 00:44:46.159
we know I'll get the same
answer.

00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:49.326
So similarly,
I would find that

00:44:49.326 --> 00:44:55.977
Ŝ_2 equals 1 plus
B S_1 and this is the

00:44:55.977 --> 00:45:01.268
best response of Player II,
as it depends on Player I's

00:45:01.268 --> 00:45:05.254
choice of effort S_1.
Okay, now I found out what

00:45:05.254 --> 00:45:08.996
Player I's best response is to
Player II, and what Player II's

00:45:08.996 --> 00:45:12.798
best response is to Player I for
each possible choice of Player

00:45:12.798 --> 00:45:15.586
II up here,
and for each possible choice of

00:45:15.586 --> 00:45:18.316
Player I down there.
Now, let's see if we can get a

00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:26.469
bit further.
And to get a bit further,

00:45:26.469 --> 00:45:36.724
let's draw a picture.
What I'm going to do is I want

00:45:36.724 --> 00:45:43.546
to draw the two functions we
just found and see what they

00:45:43.546 --> 00:45:46.556
look like.
This is all in your notes

00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:54.664
already, so I can get rid of it.
What I can do with is some more

00:45:54.664 --> 00:45:58.659
chalk.
Excuse me.

00:45:58.659 --> 00:46:03.875
So what I'm going to do is,
let's draw a picture that has

00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:09.463
S_1 on the horizontal
axis and S_2 on the

00:46:09.463 --> 00:46:14.962
vertical axis.
And there are different choices

00:46:14.962 --> 00:46:21.743
here 1,2, 3, and 4 for Player I,
and here's the 45º

00:46:21.743 --> 00:46:27.432
line.
If I'm careful I should get

00:46:27.432 --> 00:46:34.399
this right 1,2,
3, and 4 are the possible

00:46:34.399 --> 00:46:40.270
choices for Player I.
Now before I draw it I better

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:44.065
decide what B is going to be.
Okay, so I'm going to draw for

00:46:44.065 --> 00:46:48.157
the case--I'm going to draw the
best response of Player I and

00:46:48.157 --> 00:46:51.771
I'm going to draw the best
response for Player II in a

00:46:51.771 --> 00:46:59.900
minute,
for the case B equals 1/4.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.995
So we said B was somewhere
between 0 and 1/4,

00:47:02.995 --> 00:47:05.739
let's draw the case for B
equals 1/4.

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:09.978
So the expression I want to
draw first of all is the best

00:47:09.978 --> 00:47:14.291
response of Player I as a
function of S_2 and we

00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:18.000
agreed that that was given by 1
plus 1/4 now,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.535
1 plus 1/4 S_2.
So for each possible choice of

00:47:26.535 --> 00:47:29.692
S_2,
I'm going to draw Player I's

00:47:29.692 --> 00:47:32.699
best response and we'll do it in
red.

00:47:32.699 --> 00:47:39.739
So if Player II chooses 0,
what is Player I's best

00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:42.480
response?
Somebody shout out.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.670
Student: 1.
Professor Ben Polak: 1,

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:47.007
okay.
So 1 plus 1/4 of 0 is 1,

00:47:47.007 --> 00:47:54.586
so if Player II chooses 0,
Player I's best response is to

00:47:54.586 --> 00:48:00.280
choose 1.
What if Player II chooses 4?

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:06.099
If Player II chooses 4,
what would be Player I's best

00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:09.732
response?
So it'll be 1 plus 1/4 times

00:48:09.732 --> 00:48:12.821
4,1/4 times 4 is 1,
so 1 plus 1 is 2,

00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:17.539
so Player II's best response in
that case will be 2.

00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:22.751
So if Player I chooses 4,
Player II should choose,

00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:28.706
I'm sorry, Player II chooses 4,
Player I should choose 2,

00:48:28.706 --> 00:48:33.280
and this is a straight line in
between.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.392
So the line I've just drawn is
the best response for Player I

00:48:38.392 --> 00:48:41.630
as it depends on Player II's
choice.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.730
Everyone happy with how I drew
that?

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:46.565
I'm assuming you're taking it
on faith that it is a straight

00:48:46.565 --> 00:48:48.449
line in between,
but it is.

00:48:48.449 --> 00:48:51.156
The way we read this graph,
is you give me an

00:48:51.156 --> 00:48:53.862
S_2,
I read across to the pink line

00:48:53.862 --> 00:48:57.702
and drop down,
and that tells me the best

00:48:57.702 --> 00:49:01.897
response for Player I.
Now we can do the same for

00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:06.068
Player II, we can draw Player
II's best response as it depends

00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:09.367
on the choices of Player I,
but rather than go through any

00:49:09.367 --> 00:49:11.780
math, I already know what that
line's going to look like.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.850
What does that line look like?
Somebody raise your hand.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.985
Somebody?
What will Player II's best

00:49:17.985 --> 00:49:23.612
response look like as a function
of Player I's choice in the same

00:49:23.612 --> 00:49:25.877
picture?
Someone we haven't had before,

00:49:25.877 --> 00:49:27.909
we've had all these guys
before, someone else.

00:49:27.909 --> 00:49:31.210
Yeah, there's a guy in the
middle, can we get in to him?

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.739
Yeah, maybe it's easier from
that side.

00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:35.269
Shout out loud so the mike can
hear you.

00:49:35.269 --> 00:49:37.687
Student: It should be a
reflection across the 45°

00:49:37.687 --> 00:49:38.503
line.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:49:38.503 --> 00:49:40.522
Right, exactly.
So if I drew the equivalent

00:49:40.522 --> 00:49:43.297
line for Player II,
which is Player II's best

00:49:43.297 --> 00:49:45.820
response for each choice of
Player I,

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.828
we're simply flipping the
identities of the players,

00:49:48.828 --> 00:49:52.249
which means we'll be reflecting
everything in that 45º

00:49:52.249 --> 00:49:56.434
line.
So it'll go from 1 here to 2

00:49:56.434 --> 00:50:02.413
here, and it'll look like this.
So this the best response for

00:50:02.413 --> 00:50:05.460
Player II for every possible
choice of Player I,

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.209
and just to make sure we
understand it,

00:50:07.209 --> 00:50:10.110
what this blue line tells me is
you give me an S_1,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:14.515
an effort level of Player I,
I read up to the blue line and

00:50:14.515 --> 00:50:18.769
go across and that tells me
Player II's best response.

00:50:18.769 --> 00:50:21.940
Okay, now we're making some
progress.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.115
What do we notice?
Remember we said that one of

00:50:24.115 --> 00:50:26.119
the lessons of today's class,
the second lesson.

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:28.336
The first lesson was don't
shoot towards the middle of the

00:50:28.336 --> 00:50:30.320
goal and the second more general
lesson was what?

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.212
It was don't ever play a
strategy that is not a best

00:50:34.212 --> 00:50:38.041
response to everything.
I admit I'm cheating a little

00:50:38.041 --> 00:50:41.818
bit here because I'm ignoring
beliefs, but trust me that's

00:50:41.818 --> 00:50:46.328
okay in this game.
So are there strategies here

00:50:46.328 --> 00:50:51.230
that are never a best response
to anything?

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.148
Put another way,
what strategies of Player I's

00:50:55.148 --> 00:50:59.180
are ever a best response?
Anybody?

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:03.251
Well, let's have a look.
If Player II chooses 0 then

00:51:03.251 --> 00:51:07.099
Player I's best response is 1,
and that's as low as he ever

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:12.295
goes.
So these strategies down here

00:51:12.295 --> 00:51:20.659
less than 1 are never a best
response for Player I.

00:51:20.659 --> 00:51:25.367
If Player II chooses 4,
then the synergy leads Player I

00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:29.639
to raise his best response all
the way up to 2,

00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:35.914
but these strategies up here
above 2 are never a best

00:51:35.914 --> 00:51:39.780
response for Player I.
Is that right?

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.371
So the strategies below 1 and
above 2 are never a best

00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:47.805
response for Player I.
Similarly, for Player II,

00:51:47.805 --> 00:51:50.299
the lowest Player I could ever
do, is choose 0,

00:51:50.299 --> 00:51:53.010
in which case Player II would
want to choose 1,

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.947
so the strategies below 1 are
never a best response for Player

00:51:56.947 --> 00:52:00.698
II.
And the strategies above 2 were

00:52:00.698 --> 00:52:04.789
never a best response for Player
II.

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:07.860
So let's actually--you might
want to be a little bit gentle

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.195
in your own notebook--but on my
board let's get rid of all these

00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:13.630
strategies that are never a best
response.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:18.247
So all of these strategies for
Player I are gone,

00:52:18.247 --> 00:52:23.250
and all of these strategies for
Player I are gone.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.792
You might want to not scribble
quite so much on your own

00:52:25.792 --> 00:52:29.840
notebook, but still.
And all these strategies for

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.928
Player II are gone,
and all these strategies for

00:52:34.928 --> 00:52:39.150
Player II are gone,
and what's left?

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:41.829
A lot of scribble is left.
What's left?

00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:49.655
So I claim if you look
carefully there's a little box

00:52:49.655 --> 00:52:55.326
in here that's still alive.
I've deleted all the strategies

00:52:55.326 --> 00:52:57.897
that were best--that are never
best responses for Player I and

00:52:57.897 --> 00:53:00.342
all the strategies that are
never best responses for Player

00:53:00.342 --> 00:53:02.522
II,
and what I've got left is that

00:53:02.522 --> 00:53:05.954
little box.
But I can't see that little

00:53:05.954 --> 00:53:12.141
box, so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to redraw that little

00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:16.150
box.
So let's redraw it.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:19.989
So it goes from 1 to 2 this
time.

00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:22.159
I'm just going to blow up that
box.

00:53:22.159 --> 00:53:30.190
So this now is 1,1 and up here
is 2,2 and let's put in numbers

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:36.510
of quarters, so this will be,
what will it be?

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:48.968
It'll be 5/4,6/4 and 7/4,
and over here it'll be 5/4,

00:53:48.968 --> 00:53:55.028
and 6/4, and 7/4.
And let's just draw how those,

00:53:55.028 --> 00:53:57.139
that pink and blue line look in
that box.

00:53:57.139 --> 00:54:03.844
This is just a picture of that
little box, so it's going to

00:54:03.844 --> 00:54:11.010
turn out it goes from--the pink
line goes from here to here and

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:15.750
the blue line goes from here to
here.

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.361
We can work it out at home and
check it carefully,

00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:23.365
but this isn't that incorrect.
So what I've done is I've

00:54:23.365 --> 00:54:26.590
redrawn the picture we just had
and blown it up.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:31.219
And have any of you seen that
picture before?

00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:33.510
Anyone here seen that picture
before?

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:37.309
That's the picture we just had,
except I've changed the numbers

00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:39.509
a bit.
Once I deleted all the

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:44.015
strategies that were never a
best response and just focused

00:54:44.015 --> 00:54:47.900
on that little box of strategies
that survived,

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.191
the picture looked exactly the
same as it did before,

00:54:51.191 --> 00:54:54.040
albeit it blown up and the
numbers changed.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.594
So what have we done so far?
We said players should never

00:54:57.594 --> 00:55:01.961
play a strategy that's never a
best response to anything,

00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:04.900
so we threw those away.
Now what's left?

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:10.940
What should we do now?
So some of the strategies that

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:15.170
we didn't throw away were best
responses to things,

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:19.027
but the things they were best
responses to have now been

00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:21.170
thrown away.
Is that right?

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.224
This should be something
familiar from when we were

00:55:23.224 --> 00:55:26.102
deleting dominated strategies.
The strategies I'm about to

00:55:26.102 --> 00:55:28.474
throw away now,
they're not--it isn't that

00:55:28.474 --> 00:55:31.541
they're not best responses,
they are best responses to

00:55:31.541 --> 00:55:33.971
something.
But the things they were best

00:55:33.971 --> 00:55:36.126
responses to,
we know are not going to be

00:55:36.126 --> 00:55:39.195
played, because they themselves
were not best responses to

00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:41.039
anything.
So what strategies do I have in

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:43.824
mind?
What strategies am I about to

00:55:43.824 --> 00:55:46.297
throw away?
Well, for example,

00:55:46.297 --> 00:55:50.676
for Player I we know now that
Player II is never going to

00:55:50.676 --> 00:55:54.611
choose any strategy below 1,
and so the lowest Player II

00:55:54.611 --> 00:55:57.242
will ever choose is 1,
and it turns out that the

00:55:57.242 --> 00:56:00.714
lowest Player II would ever do
in response to anything is 1 and

00:56:00.714 --> 00:56:04.699
above,
never leads Player I to choose

00:56:04.699 --> 00:56:10.207
a strategy less than 5/4.
The highest Player II ever

00:56:10.207 --> 00:56:14.387
chooses is 2,
and the highest response that

00:56:14.387 --> 00:56:19.960
Player I ever makes to any
strategy 2 or less is 6/4,

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.320
so all these things bigger than
6/4 can go.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.633
Let's be careful here.
These strategies I'm about to

00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:28.059
delete, it isn't that they're
never best responses,

00:56:28.059 --> 00:56:31.599
they were best responses to
things, but the things they were

00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:35.193
best responses to,
are things that are never going

00:56:35.193 --> 00:56:38.050
to be played,
so they're irrelevant.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:42.093
So we're throwing away all of
the strategies less than 5/4 for

00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:45.010
Player I and bigger than 6/4 for
Player I,

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:50.292
(which is 1½
for Player I) and similarly for

00:56:50.292 --> 00:56:53.689
Player II.
And if I did this--and again,

00:56:53.689 --> 00:56:58.096
don't scribble too much in your
notes--but if we just make it

00:56:58.096 --> 00:57:03.311
clear what's going on here,
I'm actually going to delete

00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:09.873
these strategies since they're
never going to be played--I end

00:57:09.873 --> 00:57:14.170
up with a little box again.
So everyone see what I did?

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.016
I started with a game.
I found out what Player I's

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:19.800
best response was for every
possible choice of Player II,

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.095
and I found out what Player
II's best response was for every

00:57:22.095 --> 00:57:25.389
possible strategy of Player I.
I threw away all strategies

00:57:25.389 --> 00:57:30.173
that were never a best response,
then I looked at the strategies

00:57:30.173 --> 00:57:32.696
that were left.
I said those strategies that

00:57:32.696 --> 00:57:35.300
were a best response to things
that have now been thrown away,

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.774
but not best response
otherwise, I can throw those

00:57:37.774 --> 00:57:39.785
away too.
And when I threw those away,

00:57:39.785 --> 00:57:42.748
I was left once again with a
little box, and I could do it

00:57:42.748 --> 00:57:44.360
again, and again,
and again.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.464
If I go on doing this exercise
again, and again,

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:52.219
and again what am I going to
end up with?

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:54.770
Shout it out,
what am I going to end up with?

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:57.843
The intersection, right?
If I keep on constructing these

00:57:57.843 --> 00:58:01.172
boxes within boxes,
so the next box would be a

00:58:01.172 --> 00:58:04.013
little box in here.
I'm not going to draw it,

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:07.174
but it's something like this.
But if you keep on doing boxes

00:58:07.174 --> 00:58:09.446
within boxes,
I'm going to converge in on

00:58:09.446 --> 00:58:11.719
that intersection.
So if we know people are not

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:13.607
going to play a best
response--that's never a best

00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:15.199
response,
and we know if we people are

00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:17.619
not going to play something
which is never a best response,

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:20.420
and we know people are not
going to play which is not a

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:22.443
best response,
which is not a best etc.,

00:58:22.443 --> 00:58:25.626
etc., etc.
We're going to converge in,

00:58:25.626 --> 00:58:29.449
in this game,
to just one strategy for each

00:58:29.449 --> 00:58:33.179
player, which is where they
intersect.

00:58:33.179 --> 00:58:37.795
So what we're going to converge
in on to, is the S_1*,

00:58:37.795 --> 00:58:42.835
let's call it in this case,
is equal to 1 plus B

00:58:42.835 --> 00:58:49.686
S_2* and that S2* is
equal to 1 plus B

00:58:49.686 --> 00:58:53.741
S_1*.
Actually, we can do it a little

00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:55.679
better than that,
since we know the game is

00:58:55.679 --> 00:58:59.303
symmetric,
we know that S_1* is

00:58:59.303 --> 00:59:02.730
actually equal to
S_2*.

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:05.467
So taking advantage of the fact
that we know S_1 is

00:59:05.467 --> 00:59:08.113
equal to S_2 (because
we're lying on the 45º

00:59:08.113 --> 00:59:11.185
line),
I can simplify things by making

00:59:11.185 --> 00:59:14.559
S_1* equal to
S_2*.

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:16.570
So now I've got--actually,
that looks like three

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.179
equations, it's really just two
equations, because one of them

00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:21.801
implies the other.
And I can solve them,

00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:26.524
and if I solve them out I'm
going to get something like (let

00:59:26.524 --> 00:59:30.607
me just be careful) I'm going to
get something like:

00:59:30.607 --> 00:59:34.130
1 minus B S_1* is
equal to 1,

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:38.999
or S_1* equals
S_2* is equal to 1

00:59:38.999 --> 00:59:41.631
over (1--B).
And again, anytime I'm doing

00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:43.850
algebra on the board,
someone should check me at

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.880
home, so just have a quick look
at that.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.159
Is that right?
I think that's right.

00:59:48.159 --> 00:59:52.176
My algebra, which is often
wrong, suggests that the

00:59:52.176 --> 00:59:56.674
solution is S_1*
equals S_2* equals 1

00:59:56.674 --> 00:59:58.704
over (1--B).
But what I'm doing,

00:59:58.704 --> 01:00:00.349
it's just math,
there's nothing interesting

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:03.988
going on.
I'm just trying to solve out

01:00:03.988 --> 01:00:08.980
for the equation of this point.
So what did we learn here?

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.727
We learned that in this game
deleting strategies that are

01:00:12.727 --> 01:00:15.257
never best response,
and then deleting strategies

01:00:15.257 --> 01:00:17.637
that are never best response to
anything that is a best response

01:00:17.637 --> 01:00:22.058
and so on and so forth,
yielded a single strategy for

01:00:22.058 --> 01:00:25.528
each player.
Just one strategy for each

01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:29.460
player and that strategy was
given by this equation.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.986
So if we were management
consultants working for Mckinsey

01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:35.379
or something,
and we were brought in to

01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:38.150
advise you on your homework
assignments,

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:42.521
or this law partnership on
their work practices,

01:00:42.521 --> 01:00:47.822
we would come down with a
prediction that this is how much

01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:52.946
work you're going to get.
Question, is this amount of

01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:57.619
work a good amount of work or a
bad amount of work?

01:00:57.619 --> 01:01:00.843
Here you are,
you're working for Mckinsey,

01:01:00.843 --> 01:01:05.325
you've been hired by Joe Smith
and Ann Blogs to figure out

01:01:05.325 --> 01:01:08.659
their strategy,
working on a problem in a team

01:01:08.659 --> 01:01:11.050
on working on my homework
assignments.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:13.400
You figured out how much work
they're going to contribute.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.094
Is this a good amount of work?
Are they contributing too much,

01:01:17.094 --> 01:01:20.573
too little?
Because the answer is,

01:01:20.573 --> 01:01:24.230
depending on,
compared to what?

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.263
So let me rephrase,
are these people,

01:01:26.263 --> 01:01:28.579
are these pair of partners in
the firm,

01:01:28.579 --> 01:01:34.166
or two students working on
their homework assignments,

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:40.070
are they working more or less
than an efficient level?

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:45.869
Let's have a poll,
who thinks more?

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.980
Turn the camera out into the
audience, let's have a look.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:52.073
Who thinks more?
Who thinks they're working just

01:01:52.073 --> 01:01:55.120
right?
Who thinks less?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.847
A lot of abstentions here.
I think they're working too

01:01:59.847 --> 01:02:03.639
little here compared to what's
efficient.

01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:06.474
I'll get you to solve it out on
a homework assignment,

01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:09.349
so you can actually prove that.
You can prove that,

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:12.912
in fact, if you were writing a
contract, if there was a social

01:02:12.912 --> 01:02:16.281
planner you'd work more.
But let's try and get to grips

01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:18.346
why.
Why is it that when we see

01:02:18.346 --> 01:02:20.995
these law partners,
or medical partners,

01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:24.743
or whatever it happens to be,
or students together on a

01:02:24.743 --> 01:02:27.514
homework assignment,
why is it we tend to get

01:02:27.514 --> 01:02:31.102
inefficiently little effort when
we start figuring out the

01:02:31.102 --> 01:02:33.810
strategy and working through the
game?

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.276
I'm conceding the answer.
I'm telling you they're going

01:02:36.276 --> 01:02:40.986
to work too little.
Why do they end up not working

01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:46.560
hard enough?
Any takers?

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.393
Can we get a mike in here, yeah.
Student: Because if they

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.901
work any harder than that,
then the other person is just

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:56.027
going to slack off instead.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:02:56.027 --> 01:02:57.469
right, so there's something
about that, there's something.

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:59.166
On the other hand,
this isn't really,

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.475
I mean the intuition you're
giving me is kind of a

01:03:01.475 --> 01:03:04.696
Prisoner's Dilemma intuition.
Saying I'm going to let the

01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:07.553
other guy work and I'll shirk.
But there's something,

01:03:07.553 --> 01:03:10.040
I think there's something in
that, but there's a little bit

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.969
more going on here,
what more is going on?

01:03:11.969 --> 01:03:13.460
I think that's a good first
step.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.619
There is something of that.
Yeah.

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:21.114
Student: If there are
two people working together,

01:03:21.114 --> 01:03:24.610
there's about half as much work
for each person to do.

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.921
Professor Ben Polak:
That's true, but that would

01:03:26.921 --> 01:03:28.889
suggest it doesn't matter if
they slack off.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:31.364
What's going on here,
so go back to your Economics

01:03:31.364 --> 01:03:33.890
115 or 150, if you took either
of those courses.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:36.320
What's the problem here?
What's underlying the problem?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.579
Let's get this guy in the pink
down here.

01:03:39.579 --> 01:03:41.988
Student: They only
capture fifty percent of their

01:03:41.988 --> 01:03:43.744
marginal benefit.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:03:43.744 --> 01:03:45.770
That's the point.
Good, well your name is?

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.198
Student: Patrick.
Professor Ben Polak: So

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:49.030
Patrick is giving,
I think, it's the correct

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:51.557
answer here.
The problem here isn't really

01:03:51.557 --> 01:03:54.211
about the amount of work.
It isn't even,

01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:57.771
by the way, about the synergy.
You might think it's because of

01:03:57.771 --> 01:04:00.450
this synergy that they don't
take into account correctly.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.243
That isn't the problem here.
It turns out even without the

01:04:02.243 --> 01:04:03.409
synergy this problem would be
there.

01:04:03.409 --> 01:04:04.969
The problem is what Patrick
said.

01:04:04.969 --> 01:04:09.331
The problem is that at the
margin, I, a worker in this

01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:14.269
firm, be it a law partnership or
a homework solving group,

01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:18.030
I put in, I bear the cost,
at the margin,

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:23.199
I bear the full cost at the
margin for any extra unit of

01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:28.411
effort I put in,
but I only reap half the

01:04:28.411 --> 01:04:30.730
benefits.
At the margin,

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:33.390
I'm reaping,
I'm bearing the cost for the

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:35.849
extra unit of effort I
contribute,

01:04:35.849 --> 01:04:40.970
but I'm only reaping half of
the induced profits of the firm,

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:46.298
because of profit sharing.
That leads all of us to put in

01:04:46.298 --> 01:04:51.243
too little effort.
What's the general term that

01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:55.980
captures all such situations in
Economics?

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.030
It's an "externality."
It's an externality.

01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:07.578
There's an externality here.
When I'm figuring out how much

01:05:07.578 --> 01:05:11.926
effort to contribute to this
firm I don't take into account

01:05:11.926 --> 01:05:15.449
that other half of profits that
goes to you.

01:05:15.449 --> 01:05:18.630
So this isn't to do with the
synergy.

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.150
It isn't to do with something
complicated.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.670
It's something you knew back in
115.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.312
If you have profit sharing in a
firm or profit sharing in

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.509
homework assignment,
or any joint projects,

01:05:27.509 --> 01:05:30.567
you have to worry about too
little effort being contributed

01:05:30.567 --> 01:05:36.582
because there's an externality.
My efforts benefits you not

01:05:36.582 --> 01:05:39.058
just me.
While we've got this on the

01:05:39.058 --> 01:05:40.760
board, let's just think a little
bit more.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:45.739
What would happen if we changed
the degree of the synergy?

01:05:45.739 --> 01:05:48.469
What would happen if we lowered
B?

01:05:48.469 --> 01:05:51.577
So B is the degree to which the
synergy across these workers,

01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:53.648
if we lowered B,
what would happen to our

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:58.480
picture?
Let me redraw a picture

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:06.437
unscribbled.
We had a picture that looked

01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:12.988
something like this.
This was S_1 and this

01:06:12.988 --> 01:06:15.995
was S_2.
If we lowered the degree of

01:06:15.995 --> 01:06:19.452
synergy, what would happen to
the effort level that we'd find

01:06:19.452 --> 01:06:21.320
by this method?
What would happen?

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.440
What would happen to the
picture?

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.848
Anybody, again this is a 115
kind of exercise,

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.990
we're going to be moving lines
around.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:34.260
Yeah, Henry isn't it?
So let's get a mike in to Henry.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.005
Student: The lines will
get shallower and eventually

01:06:36.005 --> 01:06:37.389
become horizontal and vertical
respectively.

01:06:37.389 --> 01:06:38.090
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, good.

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.733
So the pink line is actually
going to get steeper,

01:06:40.733 --> 01:06:44.859
but I know what you mean.
So the pink line is going to

01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:50.104
move towards the vertical,
and the blue line is going to

01:06:50.104 --> 01:06:55.543
move towards the horizontal,
and notice that the amount of

01:06:55.543 --> 01:06:59.740
effort that we generate,
goes down dramatically,

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.914
goes down in this direction.
So if we lower the synergy

01:07:03.914 --> 01:07:06.795
here, not only do I contribute
less effort, but you know I

01:07:06.795 --> 01:07:09.553
contribute less effort,
and therefore you contribute

01:07:09.553 --> 01:07:15.008
less effort and so on.
So we get this scissors effect

01:07:15.008 --> 01:07:20.432
of looking at it this way.
We could draw other lessons

01:07:20.432 --> 01:07:23.480
from this, but let me try and
move on a little bit.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.138
We decided in this game to
solve it by looking at best

01:07:27.138 --> 01:07:31.349
responses, deleting things that
were never a best response,

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:33.393
looking again,
deleting things that were never

01:07:33.393 --> 01:07:35.300
a best response,
and so on and so forth,

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.436
and luckily,
in this particular game,

01:07:38.436 --> 01:07:43.141
things converged and they
converged to the points where

01:07:43.141 --> 01:07:46.540
the pink and the blue line
crossed.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:52.987
What do we call that point?
What do we call the point where

01:07:52.987 --> 01:07:55.320
the pink and the blue line
cross?

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.480
That's an important idea for
this class.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:06.265
That's going to turn out to be
what's called a Nash

01:08:06.265 --> 01:08:09.659
Equilibrium.
So we know what it's called.

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:13.079
How many of you have heard the
term Nash Equilibrium before?

01:08:13.079 --> 01:08:15.889
How many of you saw the movie
about Nash?

01:08:15.889 --> 01:08:18.430
We'll come back and talk about
that a bit next time.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:22.190
So this is a Nash Equilibrium,
but okay we know what it is in

01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:24.880
jargon, and we know,
we kind of knew that was going

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.281
to be an important point,
because most of you have taken

01:08:27.281 --> 01:08:29.988
Economics courses before and you
know that whenever lines cross

01:08:29.988 --> 01:08:35.200
in Economics it's important,
right?

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.912
But what does it mean here?
Why is it--what's going on at

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:41.665
that line?
What does it tell us that the

01:08:41.665 --> 01:08:46.029
pink and the blue line cross?
What makes that point special?

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:51.960
What does it mean to say the
pink and the blue line cross?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.113
Can I get the guy way back,
like three rows behind you in

01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:56.920
purple?
Shout out again.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.340
Student: It means that
neither player has an incentive

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.608
to deviate from that point.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:09:01.608 --> 01:09:04.397
right, well that's correct.
So let's try and read that

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:06.528
through.
So I don't know your name,

01:09:06.528 --> 01:09:07.989
your name is?
Student: Allen.

01:09:07.989 --> 01:09:12.387
Professor Ben Polak: So
Allen is saying if Player I is

01:09:12.387 --> 01:09:16.124
choosing this strategy and
Player II is choosing her

01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:20.048
corresponding strategy here,
neither player has an incentive

01:09:20.048 --> 01:09:22.433
to deviate.
Another way of saying it is:

01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:24.649
neither player wants to move
away.

01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:27.330
So if Player I chooses
S_1*,

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:31.676
Player II will want to choose
S_2* since that's her

01:09:31.676 --> 01:09:34.449
best response.
If Player II is playing

01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:37.069
S_2*,
Player I will want to play

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:40.199
S_1* since that's his
best response.

01:09:40.199 --> 01:09:43.800
Neither has any incentive to
move away.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.571
So more succinctly,
Player I and Player II,

01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:52.779
at this point where the lines
cross, Player I and Player II

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:56.909
are playing a best response to
each other.

01:09:56.909 --> 01:10:20.640
The players are playing a best
response to each other.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.640
So clearly in this game,
it's where the lines cross.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.720
Let's go back to the game we
played with the numbers.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.984
Everyone had to choose a number
and the winner was going to the

01:10:29.984 --> 01:10:32.460
person who was closest to 2/3 of
the average.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.284
(By the way,
the winner's never picked up

01:10:35.284 --> 01:10:39.098
their winnings for that,
so they still can.) So in that

01:10:39.098 --> 01:10:42.700
game, what's the Nash
Equilibrium in that game?

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:48.434
Everyone choosing 1.
How do we know that's the Nash

01:10:48.434 --> 01:10:52.138
Equilibrium of that game?
How do we know that everyone

01:10:52.138 --> 01:10:55.105
choosing 1 is the Nash
Equilibrium in the game where

01:10:55.105 --> 01:10:57.407
you all chose numbers?
Well let's just use the

01:10:57.407 --> 01:10:59.699
definition.
If everybody chose a 1,

01:10:59.699 --> 01:11:04.445
the average in the class would
be 1,2/3 of that would be 2/3

01:11:04.445 --> 01:11:08.934
and you can't go down below 1,
so everyone's best response

01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:11.318
would be to choose 1.
Say it again:

01:11:11.318 --> 01:11:14.669
if everyone chose 1,
then everyone's best response

01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:17.677
would be to choose 1,
so that would be a Nash

01:11:17.677 --> 01:11:20.174
Equilibrium.
Did people play Nash

01:11:20.174 --> 01:11:22.710
Equilibrium when we played that
game?

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.947
No, they didn't.
Not initially at any rate,

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.704
but notice as we played the
game repeatedly,

01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:30.358
what happens?
As we played the game

01:11:30.358 --> 01:11:35.242
repeatedly, we noticed that play
seemed to converge down towards

01:11:35.242 --> 01:11:37.130
1.
Is that right?

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.359
In this game,
when we analyzed the game

01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:45.460
repeatedly, it seemed like our
analysis converged towards the

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.000
equilibrium.
Now that's not always going to

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.479
happen but it's kind of a nice
feature about Nash Equilibrium.

01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:56.340
Sometimes play tends to
converge there.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.916
Nash Equilibrium's going to be
a huge idea from now to the

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:03.933
mid-term exam and we're going to
pick it up and see more examples

01:12:03.933 --> 01:12:04.933
on Wednesday.

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.360
what I want to do this time
is talk about probability.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.110
I don't think many of you
have taken a course

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.950
in probability theory.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.020
I don't take that as a
prerequisite for this course,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.750
but I think that actually
probability theory is

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.870
fundamental to the way we
think about finance.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.960
So, I wanted to talk about
that a little bit today.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.510
And I'm going to put it in a
concrete context, namely, the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.440
crisis that's the world has been
through since 2007, and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.630
which we're still in
at this point.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.430
It's a financial crisis that's
bigger than any since the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.390
Great Depression
of the 1930's.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.020
There's many different ways
of thinking about

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.410
a crisis like this.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.720
And I wanted to focus on one way
that people think about it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.920
in terms of probability
models.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.990
So, that's not the only way,
it's not necessarily my

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.520
favorite way of thinking
about it.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.570
That's, I think, a good way of
introducing our discussion of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.100
probability as it relates
to finance.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.330
Excuse my cold.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.025
I am managing to talk.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:21.570
I didn't bring any water.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.610
I hope I make it through
this lecture.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.860
It's a little bit iffy.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730
So, let's just think
about the crisis.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.190
Most people, when they talk
about financial crises, they

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.870
talk in terms of narrative,
of a historical narrative.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
So, I'll give you a quick and
easy historical narrative

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.900
about the crisis.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.320
The crisis began with bubbles
in the stock market, and the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.530
housing market, and also in
the commodities market.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.000
Bubbles are --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.080
I will talk about these later,
but bubbles are events, in

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.740
which people get very excited
about something, and they

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.440
drive the prices up really high,
and it's got to break

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.690
eventually.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.450
And there was a pre-break around
2000 when the stock

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630
market collapsed around
the world.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.800
All over the world, the stock
markets collapsed in 2000.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.410
But then they came back again
after 2003 and they were on

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.340
another boom, like a roller
coaster ride.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.500
And then they collapsed again.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.670
That's the narrative story.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.290
And then, both the housing
market and the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.620
stock market collapsed.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.580
And then, what happened
is, we see a bunch of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.540
institutional collapses.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.170
So, we see, in 2007, failures in
companies that had invested

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.940
in home mortgages.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.910
And we see a run on a
bank in the United

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.120
Kingdom, Northern Rock.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.870
It was arrested, but it looked
like 1930's all over again

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.340
with the bank failure.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.190
We saw bank failures in
the United States.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.990
And then, we saw international
cooperation to prevent this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.880
from spreading like a disease.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.190
And then, we had governments all
over the world bailing out

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.360
their banks and other
companies.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.440
So, a disaster was
averted, and then

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.750
we had a nice rebound.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.900
That's the narrative
story, OK.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.020
And it makes it sound -- and I'm
going to come back to it,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.390
because I like the narrative
story of the collapse.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.310
But I want to today focus on
something that's more in

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.480
keeping with probability, with
the way financial theorists

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.820
think about it.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.860
And what financial theorists
will think about is that

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.140
actually it's not just
those few big events.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.210
The crisis we got into was the
accumulation of a lot of

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.770
little events.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.360
And sometimes they accumulate
according to the laws of

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.560
probability into big events.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.770
And you are just telling
stories around these

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.580
accumulation of shocks that
effected the economy.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.450
And the stories are
not, by some

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.380
accounts, not that helpful.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.620
We want to understand the
underlying probabilities.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.325
And so that's --

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.420
thank you, a good assistant.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.310
He knows what I need.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.280
I just announced what
I need, he got it.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.640
A bottle of water.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.650
Tomorrow I may have absolutely
no voice.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.900
You're lucky.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.000
I'm going to talk today about
probability, and variance, and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.690
covariance, and regression, and
idiosyncratic risk, and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.170
systematic risk.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.110
Things like that which are
core concepts in finance.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.990
But I'm also going to, in the
context of the crisis,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.960
emphasize in this lecture,
breakdowns of some of the most

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.330
popular assumptions that
underlie financial theory.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.690
And I'm thinking particularly
of two breakdowns.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.740
And we'll emphasize
these as other

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.860
interpretations of the crisis.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.290
One is the failure
of independence.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.100
I'll come back and
redefine that.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.290
And another one is a tendency
for outliers or fat-tailed

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.850
distributions.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.630
So, I'll have to explain
what all that means.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:54.020
But basically, let me just
try to elaborate on --

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:02.030
probability theory is a
conceptual framework that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.090
mathematicians invented.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.970
And it's become a very important
way of thinking, but

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.950
it doesn't go back
that far in time.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.890
The word probability in its
present meaning wasn't even

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.510
coined until the 1600's.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:27.080
So, you if you talk to someone
before the year 1600, and say,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.240
this has a probability of 0.5,
they would have no idea what

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.650
you're talking about.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.380
So, it's a major advance in
human understanding to think

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.280
in terms of probabilities.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.440
Now we do.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.270
And now it's routine, but it
wasn't routine at all.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.880
And part of what I'm thinking
about is, what probability

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.550
theorists do, or in particular
finance theorists like to do,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.590
is they think that the world
is, well, let me just say,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.180
it's kind of a realization
that the world is very

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.300
complex, and that the outcomes
that we see are the results of

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.250
millions of little things.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.920
And the stories we tell
are just stories.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.330
So, how do we deal with the
complexity of the world?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Well, we do it by dealing
with all of these little

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.990
incremental shocks that
affect our lives in a

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.960
mathematical way.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.660
And we think of them as
millions of shocks.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.160
How do they accumulate?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.950
We have mathematical laws
of how they accumulate.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:46.230
And once we understand those
laws, we can we can build

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.870
mathematical models
of the outcomes.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.750
And then we can ask whether we
should be surprised by the

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.050
financial events that
we've seen.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.740
It's a little bit like science,
real hard science.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.990
So, for example, weather
forecasters.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.980
They build models that
-- you know, you see

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.320
these weather forecasts.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.140
They have computer models that
are built on the theory of

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.280
fluid dynamics.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.670
And there is a theory of all
those little atoms moving

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.090
around in the air.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:27.400
And there's too many atoms to
count, but there's some laws

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.230
about their cumulative movement
that we understand.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.300
And it actually allows us
to forecast the weather.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.350
And so, people who are steeped
in this tradition in finance

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.810
think that what we're doing
when we're doing financial

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.120
forecast is very much
like what we do when

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.680
we do weather forecasts.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.150
We have a statistical model,
we see all of the shocks

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.810
coming in, and of course there
will be hurricanes.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.830
And we can only forecast them --
you know there's a limit to

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.240
how far out we can
forecast them.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.740
So, all hurricanes are
a surprise two

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.530
weeks before they happen.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.410
Weather forecasters
can't do that.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.560
Same thing with financial
crises.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.260
This would be the model.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.780
We understand the probability
laws, there's only a certain

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.580
time horizon before which
we can forecast

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.290
the financial crisis.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.680
That isn't exactly my view
of the situation.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.230
I'm presenting a view this
time which is very

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.340
mathematical and probability
theory oriented.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.770
So, let me get into some
of these details.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.320
And again, these are going to
be re-covered in the review

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.560
session that Elan Fuld,
one of our teaching

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.810
assistants, will do.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.220
I have just slides with
graphs and equations.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.220
But, that's not Elan Fuld.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.950
I want to start out with just
the concept of return.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.920
Which is, in finance, the
basic, the most basic

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.400
concept that --

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.290
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.350
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: When
you invest in something, you

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.190
have to do it for
a time interval.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.520
And I'm writing the return
as one time period.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.600
T is time.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.310
And so, it could be a year, or
it could be months, or it

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.560
could be a day.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.390
We're going to number these
months, let's say it's monthly

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:49.210
return, we're going to number
these months, so that the

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.180
first month is number one,
second month is number two.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.420
And so, return at time t, if t
is equal to 3, that would be

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.070
the return at month three.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.610
And we'll do price at the
beginning of the month.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.230
And so, what is your return
to investing in something?

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.660
It's the increase
in the price.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.140
That's p t plus 1, minus p t.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.310
I'm spelling it out here.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.170
Price --

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.180
I spelled it out in the
numerator, I guess I didn't do

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.430
it in the denominator.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.870
It's price at time t plus 1
minus the price at time t,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.040
which is called the capital
gain, plus the dividend, which

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.460
is a check you receive, if you
do, from the company that

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.470
you're investing in.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.360
That's the return.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.240
We have something else
called gross return.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.480
Which is just 1 plus
the return.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.280
Returns can be positive
or negative.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.880
They can never be more than --
never be less than minus 100%.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.630
In a limited liability economy
that we live in, the law says

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.380
that you cannot lose more than
the money you put in, and

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.420
that's going to be
our assumption.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.290
So, return is between minus
100% and plus infinity.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.400
And gross return is
always positive.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.730
It's between zero
and infinity.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.710
Now what we're going to do --

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.150
this is the primary thing that
we want to study, because we

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.460
are interested in investing
and in making a return.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:30.530
So, we want to do some
evaluations of the success of

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.110
an investment.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.580
So, I want to now talk about
some basic statistical

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.330
concepts that we can apply to
returns and to other random

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.580
variables as well.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.480
These on this slide are
mostly concepts that

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.490
you've already heard.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.410
This is expected value.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.560
This is the mathematical
expectation of a random

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.110
variable x, which could be the
return, or the gross return,

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.942
or something else, but
we're going to

00:13:05.942 --> 00:13:07.750
substitute something else.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.770
We're going to substitute
in what they are.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.410
So, the expectation of x, or
the mean of x, mu sub x is

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.900
another term for it, is the
weighted sum of all possible

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.960
values of x weighted by
their probabilities.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.690
And the probabilities
have to sum to 1.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.930
They're positive numbers, or
zero or positive numbers,

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.280
reflecting the likelihood
of that random variable

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.010
occurring, of that value of the
random variable occurring.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.900
So, I have here --

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.960
there's an infinite number of
possible values for x, and we

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.430
have a probability for each one,
and the expectation of x

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.290
is that weighted sum of those,
weighted by probabilities, of

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.920
those possible values.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.240
This is for a discrete random
variable that takes on only a

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.250
finite, only a countable
number of values.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.080
If it's a continuous random
variable, if x is continuous,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:16.390
then the expectation of x is an
integral of the probability

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.440
density of x, times x dx.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.650
I'm just writing that down for
you now for completeness.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.273
But I'm not going to explain
or elaborate that.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:35.750
These two formulas here are
measures of the central

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.060
tendency of x, OK.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:49.250
It's essentially the average of
x in the probability metric

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.310
that we have up here.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.100
But this formula is something
we use to estimate the

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.350
expected value of x.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.690
This is called the mean or
average, which you've

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.450
learned long ago.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:08.720
If you have n observations on
a random variable x, you can

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.670
take the sum of the x
observations, summation over i

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.050
equals 1 to n, and then
divide that by n.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.740
That's called the average.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.260
So, what I want to say is that
this is the average, or the

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.810
mean, or sample mean when
you have a sample of n

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.910
observations, which is
an estimate of the

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.230
expected value of x.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.160
So, for example, if we're
evaluating an investor who has

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.010
invested money, you could get n
observations, say an annual

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.840
returns, and you can take
an average of them.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.630
And that's the first and most
obvious metric representing

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:53.230
the success of the investments
if x is the return, OK.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.950
People are always wanting to
know, they're looking at

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.740
someone who invests money, is
this person a success or not?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.890
Well this is the first and
most obvious measure.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.020
Let's see what that person
did on average.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.010
You were investing for, let's
say n equals 10, ten years,

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.290
let's take the returns you made
each year, add them up

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.370
and divide by 10.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.610
And that gives us an average.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.970
I put this formula down as
an alternative, because

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.690
it's another --

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.370
this is called the
geometric mean.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.680
This is the arithmetic mean.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.170
This is the geometric mean and
you're probably not so

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.170
familiar with that, because
it's a different concept.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.730
The geometric mean, instead of
adding your n observations,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.600
you multiply them together.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.120
You form a product of them.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.810
And then, instead of dividing by
n, you take the nth root of

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.990
the product.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.720
And so, that's a formula that's
used to estimate the

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.520
average return of a portfolio
of investments, where we use

00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:01.030
gross return for x, not just
the simple return.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.340
This geometric mean makes sense
only when all the x's

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.300
are non-negative.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.030
If you put in a negative
value, you might get a

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.890
negative product, and then, if
you took the nth root of that,

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.840
it could be an imaginary number,
so let's forget that.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.510
We're not going to apply this
formula if there are any

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.630
negative numbers.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:25.440
But it's often used, and
I recommend its use, in

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.520
evaluating investments.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.760
Because if you use gross return,
it gives a better

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.720
measure of the outcome
of the investments.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.870
So, think of it this way.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.150
Suppose you invested money with
some investment manager,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.900
and the guy said, I've
done a wonderful job

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.390
investing your money.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.000
I made 50% one year, I made 30%
another year, oh, and by

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.830
the way, I had one bad year
with minus 100%, OK.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.100
So, what do you think
of this investor?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.920
Well, if you think about it, if
he made 50% one year, and

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.046
then 30% another year, and
then he lost everything.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.700
That dominates everything,
right?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.360
If you have a minus 100% simple
return, your gross

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.550
return is 0, OK?

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.900
So, if I plug in, if I put in
a 0 here to any of the x's,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.250
right, this product will be 0.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.440
Anything times 0 is 0.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.490
And I take the nth root of
zero, and what's that?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.900
It's 0.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.230
So, if there's ever a year in
which the return is minus

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:38.490
100%, then the geometric
mean is 0.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.820
That's a good discipline.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.250
This obviously doesn't make
sense as a way to evaluate

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.360
investment success.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.940
Are you with me on this?

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.750
Because you care a lot, if
the guy wipes you out.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.110
Whatever else is done after
that doesn't matter.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.430
So, that's why we want to use
the geometric return.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.920
These are all measures
of central tendency.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.230
That is, what is the
central result?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.560
Sometimes the investor had a
good year, sometimes the

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.520
investor had a bad year, but
what was the typical or

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.590
central value?

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.840
So, these are a couple
of measures of them.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.890
But we care about more than just
about central tendency

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.810
when evaluating risk.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.540
We have to do other
things as well.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.420
And so, you want to talk about
-- and this is very

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.900
fundamental to finance.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.540
We have to talk about risk.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.180
What could be more fundamental
than risk for finance?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.890
So, what we have here now is
a measure of variability.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:48.010
And the upper equation here is
something called variance.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:56.380
And it's equal to the weighted
average of the x random

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.608
variables [correction:
realizations of

00:19:56.608 --> 00:19:57.300
the x random variable]

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.200
squared deviation from
the mean, weighted by

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.010
probabilities.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.150
OK?

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:09.180
All it is, is the expectation of
the square of the deviation

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.100
from the mean.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.820
The mean is the center value,
and the deviations from the

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.070
mean are --

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.380
whether they're positive or
negative, if you square them

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.820
they become positive numbers.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.670
And so, that's called
variance.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.650
So, for example, if
x tends to be --

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.240
if the return tends to
be plus or minus 1%

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.630
from the mean return...

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.790
say the mean return for an
investor is 8% a year, and

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.190
it's plus or minus 1%, then
you would see a lot of 1's

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.440
when you squared the deviation
from the mean.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.860
And the variance would
probably be 1.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.030
And the standard deviation,
which is --

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:03.670
the standard deviation is the
square root of the variance.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.350
And it would also be 1.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.430
OK.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.920
This is a very simple concept.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.250
It's just the average squared
deviation from the mean.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.930
The estimate of the variance,
or the sample variance, is

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.040
given by this equation.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.160
And it's s squared of x.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160
It's just the sample mean.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.320
Take deviations of the variable
from its sample mean.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.480
You have n observations, say
someone has invested money for

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.080
ten years, you take the average
return for the ten

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.170
years and that's x bar, and
then you take all 10

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:49.580
deviations from the mean
and square them, and

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.640
then divide by n.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.600
Some people divide by n minus
1, but I'm just trying to be

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.030
very basic and simple here, so
I'm not going to get into

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.785
these ideas.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.510
The next thing is covariance.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.870
We're getting through
these concepts.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.710
They're very basic concepts.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.630
Covariance is a measure of how
two different random variables

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.430
move together.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.380
So, I have two different random
variables, x and y.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:30.000
So, x is the return on, let's
say, the IBM Corporation, and

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.490
y is the return on General
Motors Corporation.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.330
And I want to know, when IBM
goes up, does General Motors

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.340
go up or not?

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:47.600
So, a measure of the co-movement
of the two would

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.500
be to take the deviation of
x from its mean times the

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.600
deviation of y from it's
mean, and take the

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.210
average product of those.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.060
And that's called covariance.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.750
It's a positive number if, when
x is high relative to

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.660
it's mean, y is high relative
to its mean also.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.550
And it's a negative number if
they tend to go in opposite

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.550
directions.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:21.080
If GM tends to do well when IBM
does poorly, then we have

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.870
a negative covariance.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.790
Because, if one is above its
mean, and the other is below

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.050
its mean, the product is going
to be a negative number.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.760
If we get a lot of negative
products like that, it means

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.920
that they tend to move
opposite each other.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.490
And if they are unrelated
to each other, then the

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.000
covariance tends to be 0.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.200
And this is the core concept
that I was talking about.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.940
Some idea of unrelatedness
underlies a lot of our

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.190
thinking in risk.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.090
So, if x and y are independent,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.230
they're generated --

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.730
suppose IBM's business has just
nothing at all to do with

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.790
GM's businesses, they're
so different.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.800
Then I'd say the covariance
is probably 0.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:14.900
And then we can use that as a
principle, which will underlie

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.790
our later analysis.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.650
Correlation is a scaled
covariance.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.630
And it's a measure of how much
two variables move together.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.810
But it's scaled, so that it
varies only over the range of

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.380
minus 1 to plus 1.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.990
So, the correlation between two
random variables is their

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.400
covariance divided by the
product of their standard

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.540
deviations.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.220
And you can show that that
always ranges between minus 1

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.610
and plus 1.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.800
So, if two variables have a plus
1 correlation, that means

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.425
they move exactly together.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.550
When one moves up 5%, the other
one moves up 5% exactly.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.590
If they have a correlation of
minus 1, it means the move

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.840
exactly opposite each other.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.270
These things don't happen very
often in finance, but in

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.800
theory that's what happens.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.710
If they have a zero correlation,
that means

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.900
there's no tendency for them
to move together at all.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.830
If two variables are
independent, then their

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.550
correlation should be zero.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:37.240
OK, the variance of the sum of
two random variables is the

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.940
variance of the first random
variable, plus the variance of

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.500
the second random variable, plus
twice the covariance of

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.450
the random variables.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.190
So, if the two random variables
are independent of

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.700
each other, then their
covariance is zero, and then

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.930
the variance of the sum is
the sum of the variances.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.140
But that is not necessary.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:06.860
That's true if the random
variables are independent, but

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.900
we're going to see that
breakdown of independence is

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.600
the story of this lecture
right now.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.150
We want to think about
independence

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.210
as mattering a lot.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.250
And it's a model, or a core
idea, but when do we know that

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.500
things are independent?

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.090
OK, this is a plot.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.580
I was telling you earlier
about the --

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:45.360
let me see, OK, let me just
hold off on that a minute.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.140
Well, I'll tell you
what that was.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.950
That was a plot of the stock
market from 2000 to 2010 in

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.040
the U.S. And I'm going
to come back to that.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.950
These are the crises I was
telling you about.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.860
This is the decline in the stock
market from 2000 to 2002

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.670
or 2003 and this is the
more recent decline

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:17.190
from 2007 to 2009.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.420
Those are the cumulative effects
of a lot of little

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:25.160
shocks that didn't happen
all at once.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.640
It happened over years.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.380
And we want to think about
the probability of

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.690
those shocks occurring.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:41.830
And that's where I am going.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:51.440
But what I want to talk about
is the core concept of

00:27:51.440 --> 00:28:02.020
independence leading to some
basic principles of risk

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.610
management.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:09.220
The crisis that we've seen here
in the stock market is

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.230
the accumulation of --

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.740
you see all these ups and downs
in the stock market, and

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:21.820
then all these ups and
downs on the way up.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.450
There were relatively more downs
in the period from 2000

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.170
and 2002 and there were
relatively more ups from the

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.300
period 2003 to 2006.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.710
But how do we understand the
cumulative effect of it, which

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:37.450
is what matters?

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:43.690
So, we have to have some kind
of probability Model.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:48.130
The question immediately is, are
these shocks that affected

00:28:48.130 --> 00:29:01.580
the stock market, are they
independent, or are they

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.010
somehow related to each other?

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:10.670
And that is a core question that
made it so difficult for

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.960
us to understand how to deal
with the potential of such a

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.760
crisis, and why so many people
got in trouble dealing with

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.010
this crisis.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:36.820
So, we had a big financial
crisis in the United States in

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.510
1987, when there was a stock
market crash that was bigger

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.630
than any before in one day.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.510
We'll be talking about that.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:57.960
But after the 1987 crash,
companies started to compute a

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.060
measure of the risk to their
company, which is

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.770
called Value at Risk.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.350
I'll write it up like that.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.960
I capitalized the first and
the last letter, so you'll

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.520
know that I'm not --
this is not the

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.090
same thing as variance.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:16.230
This is Value at Risk.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.240
And what companies would do
after 1987 to try to measure

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.610
the risk of their activities
is to compute a number

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.570
something like this.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:44.670
They would say, there's a 5%
probability that we will lose

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:51.760
$10 million in a year.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.810
That's the kind of bottom
line that Value at Risk

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.020
calculations would make.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.350
And so, you need a probability
Model to make these

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.660
calculations.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:15.420
And so, you need probability
theory in order to do that.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:21.240
Many companies had calculated
Value at Risk numbers like

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.030
this, and told their investors,
we can't do too

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.690
badly because there's no way
that we could lose --

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.715
the probability is
only 5% that we

00:31:30.715 --> 00:31:31.840
could lose $10 million.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.640
And they'd have other
numbers like this.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.470
But they were implicitly making
assumptions about

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.970
independence, or at least
relative independence.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:49.860
And that's the concept I'm
trying to emphasize here.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.600
It's a core concept
in finance.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:01.500
And it's not one that is easy
to be precise about.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.220
We have an intuitive idea that,
you know -- we see the

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.910
ups and downs on the stock
market, and we notice them,

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:13.120
and they all average out to
something not too bad.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.440
The problem that brought us this
crisis is that the Value

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.760
at Risk calculations were
too optimistic.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.020
Companies all over the world
were estimating very small

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.750
numbers here, relative to
what actually happened.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.315
And that's a problem.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.840
I wanted to emphasize
core concepts here.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:45.110
Intuitive concepts that you
probably already have. One of

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.640
these concepts is something
we'll call the

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.990
law of large numbers.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.930
And the law of large numbers
says that, there's many

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.010
different ways of formulating
it, but putting it in its

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:10.390
simplest form, that if I have
a lot of independent shocks,

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.010
and average them out, on average
there's not going to

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.970
be much uncertainty.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:21.470
If I flip a coin once, let's
say I'm making a

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.590
bet, plus or minus.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.280
If it comes up heads, I win a
dollar, if it comes up tails,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.810
I lose a dollar.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.820
Well, I have a risk.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.610
I mean, I have a standard
deviation of $1 in

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.810
my outcome for that.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:42.130
But if I do it 100 times and
average the result, there's

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.500
not going to be much
risk at all.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.240
And that's the law
of large numbers.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.800
It says that the variance of
the average of n random

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.590
variables that are all
independent and identically

00:33:55.590 --> 00:34:00.510
distributed goes to 0 as the
number of elements in the

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.270
average goes to infinity.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:11.990
And so, that's a fundamental
concept that underlies both

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.000
finance and insurance.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.740
The idea that tossing a coin or
throwing a die in a small

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.840
number of --

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.570
it has uncertainty in a small
number of observations, but

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.340
the uncertainty vanishes in a
large number of observations,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.870
goes back to the
ancient world.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.370
Aristotle made this observation,
but he didn't

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.880
have probability theory and he
couldn't carry it further.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.490
The fundamental concept of
insurance relies on this

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.730
intuitive idea.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.760
And the idea was intuitive
enough that insurance was

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.440
known and practiced
in ancient times.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:01.510
But the insurance concept
depends on independence.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:09.380
And so, independence is
something that apparently

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.620
breaks down at times
like these.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.860
Like these big down crises that
we've seen in the stock

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.500
market, in the two
episodes in the

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.490
beginning of the 20th century.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:30.040
So, the law of large numbers has
to do with the idea that

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:38.720
if I have a large number of
random variables, what is the

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.410
variance of --

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:51.810
the variance of x1 plus
x2 plus x3 up to xn?

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.660
If they're all independent,
then all of the

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.540
covariances are 0.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:07.190
So, it equals the variance of
x1, plus the variance of x2,

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.710
plus the variance of xn.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.120
There's n terms, I'm not
showing them all.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.530
OK?

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.790
So, if they all have the same
variance, then the variance of

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:25.900
the sum of n of them is n times
their variance, OK.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.290
And that means the standard
deviation, which is the square

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:33.380
root of the variance, is equal
to the square root of n times

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.660
the standard deviation
of one of them.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.880
The mean is divided by n.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.950
So, that means that the standard
deviation of the mean

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.850
is equal to the standard
deviation of one of the x's

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.880
divided by the square
root of n.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.340
So, as n goes large, you can
see that the standard

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.110
deviation of the
mean goes to 0.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.910
And that's the law
of large numbers.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.030
OK.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.210
But the problem is, so you
know, you can look at a

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.270
financial firm, and they have
returns for a number of years,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.790
and those returns can be
cumulated to give some sense

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.630
of their total outcome.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:20.810
But does the total outcome
really behave properly?

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.340
Does it become certain over
a longer interval of time?

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:31.460
Well apparently not, because
of the possibility that the

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.870
observations are not
independent.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.530
So, we want to move from
analysis of variance to

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.180
something that's more --

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:48.810
I told you that VaR came in 1987
or thereabouts, after the

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.150
stock market crash of '87.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:56.970
There's a new idea coming up
now, after this recent crisis,

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:03.180
and it's called CoVaR.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.470
And this is a concept emphasized
by Professor

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:15.280
Brunnermeier at Princeton and
some of his colleagues, that

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.050
we have to change analysis of
variance to recognize, I'm

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:24.570
sorry, we have to change Value
at Risk to recognize that

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:30.790
portfolios can sometimes co-vary
more than we thought.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.810
That there might be episodes
when everything goes wrong at

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:34.820
the same time.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.600
So, suddenly the covariance
goes up.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:46.160
So, CoVaR is an alternative
to Value at Risk that does

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.120
different kinds of
calculations.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.830
In the present environment,
I think, we recognize

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.710
the need for that.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:39:06.460
So, this is the aggregate stock
market, and let me go to

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:11.190
another plot which shows both
the same aggregate stock

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:15.850
market, that's this blue line
down here, and one stock.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:21.250
The one stock I have shown is
Apple, the computer company.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.320
And this is from the
year 2000 --

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.760
this is just the first decade
of the twentieth century.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.460
Can you see this?

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.250
Is my podium in the way
for some of you?

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.620
You might be surprised to
say, wait a minute,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.190
did I hear you right?

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.980
Is this blue line the same
line that we just saw?

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.780
But you know if I go back,
it is the same line.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.110
It's just that I rescaled it.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.300
There it is, it's a blue line.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.980
This looks scary, doesn't it?

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.760
The stock market lost
something like

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.570
almost half of its value.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:59.710
It dropped 40% between
2000 and 2002.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.150
Wow.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.350
Then it went all the way
back up, and then it

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.950
dropped almost 50%.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.770
These are scary numbers,
right?

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:15.180
But when I put Apple on the same
plot, the computer had

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.290
to, because Apple
did such amazing

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.480
things, it had to compress.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.590
And that's the same curve that
you were just looking at.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.080
It's just compressed, so that
I can plot it together.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.280
I put both of them at 100
in the year 2000.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:38.600
So, what I'm saying here is that
somehow Apple did rather

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.220
differently than the --

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.830
this is the S&amp;P 500.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.370
It's a measure of the
whole stock market.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:59.690
Apple computer is the one of the
breakout cases of dramatic

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.710
success in investing.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.120
It went up 25 times.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.480
This incidentally is the
adjusted price for Apple,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.010
because in 2005 Apple
did a 2-for-1 split.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.220
You know what that means?

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.800
By tradition in the United
States, stocks should be worth

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.790
about $30 per share.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.670
And there's no reason why they
should be $30 per share.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:29.170
But a lot of companies, when
the price hits $60 or

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.810
something like that, they say,
well let's just split all the

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.110
shares in two.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.020
So, that they're back to $30.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.950
Apple went up more than double,
but they only did one

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.180
split in this period.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.120
So, we've corrected for that.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.880
Otherwise, you'd see a big
apparent drop in their stock

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.270
price on the day of the split.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.900
Are you with me on
this split thing?

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.400
It really doesn't matter,
it's just a units thing.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.480
But you can see that an
investment in Apple went up 25

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:07.790
times, whereas an investment in
the S&amp;P 500 went up only --

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.980
well, it didn't go up,
actually, it's down.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:20.150
So now, this is a plot showing
the monthly returns on Apple.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.770
It's only the capital
gain returns, I

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.410
didn't include dividends.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:27.370
But it is essentially the return
on these two, on the

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.970
S&amp;P 500 and on Apple.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.620
Now, this is the same data you
were just looking at, but it

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.730
looks really different
now, doesn't it?

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.500
It looks really different.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.850
They're unrecognizable
as the same thing.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:47.910
You can't tell from this plot
that Apple went up 25-fold.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.290
That matters a lot
to an investor.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.870
Maybe you can, if you've
got very good eyes.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.910
There's more up ones than there
are down ones, more up

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.730
months than down months.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.220
There's a huge number of --

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.470
enormous variability
in the months.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.920
But I like to look at a picture
like this, because it

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.870
conveys to me the incredible
complexity of the story.

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:16.950
What was driving Apple up
and down so many times?

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.490
Really a pretty simple
picture.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:23.000
Buy Apple and your money
will go up 25-fold.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.030
Incidentally, if you were a
precocious teenager, and you

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:31.140
told your parents ten
years ago, OK, where

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.440
you into this then?

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.860
But just imagine, you say, mom,
let's take out a $400,000

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:44.790
mortgage on the house and put
it all in Apple stock, OK.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.790
Your parents would thank
you today if you

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.650
told them to do that.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.740
Your parents could do that.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.200
They have probably paid off
their mortgages, right, they

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.980
could go get a second
mortgage.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.500
Easily come up with $400,000.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.640
Most of your houses would
be worth that.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.860
So, what would it
be worth today?

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.750
$10 million.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:08.050
Your father, your mother would
be saying, you know, I've been

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.160
working all ten years, and your
little advice just got me

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.700
$10 million.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.460
It's more than I made,
much more than I made

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.620
in all those years.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.750
So, these kind of stories
attract attention.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.760
But you know, it wasn't
an even ride.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.880
That story seems too good
to be true, doesn't it?

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.340
I mean 25-fold?

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:34.940
The reason why it's not so
obvious is that the ride, as

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.180
you're observing this happen,
every month it goes opposite.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.250
I just goes big swings.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.520
You make 30% in one month, you
lose 30% in another month.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.280
It's a scary ride.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.070
And you can't see it happening
unless you look at your

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.360
portfolio and see what
-- you can't tell.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.230
It's just so much randomness
from one month to the other.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:01.820
Incidentally, I was a dinner
speaker last night for a Yale

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.120
alumni dinner in
New York City.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.700
And I rode in with Peter Salovey
who's Provost at Yale.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.270
And on the ride back he reminded
me of a story that I

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.030
think I've heard, but it took
me a while to remember this.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.920
But I'll tell you that it's
an important Yale story.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:32.140
And that is that in 1979, the
Yale class of 1954 had a 25th

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.460
reunion, OK.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.810
This is history.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:35.730
Do you know this story?

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.130
Do you know where I'm heading?

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.540
So, somebody said, you know,
we're here at this reunion,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.140
there's a lot of us here, let's
all, as an experiment,

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.540
chip in some money and ask an
investor to take a risky

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.970
portfolio investment for Yale
and let's give it to Yale on

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:56.950
our 50th anniversary,
all right?

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.090
Sounds like fun.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.660
So, they got a portfolio
manager, his name was Joe

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.340
McNay, and they said --

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.910
they put together --

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.100
it was $375,000.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.860
It's like one house, you know,
for all the whole class of

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.990
1954, no big deal.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:22.370
So, they gave Joe McNay
a $375,000 start.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.900
And they said, just have
fun with this.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.460
You know, we're not
conservative.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.840
If you lose the whole
thing, go ahead.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.420
But just go for maximum
return on this.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:41.120
So, Joe McNey decided to invest
in Home Depot, Walmart,

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.270
and internet stocks, OK?

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.320
And on their 50th reunion, that
was 2004, they presented

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.610
Yale University with $90
million dollars.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.010
That's an amazing story.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.900
But I'm sure it was the same
sort of thing, same kind of

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.130
roller coaster ride
the whole time.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.020
And now, we're trying to decide,
is Joe McNey a genius?

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.060
What do you think,
is he a genius?

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.130
I think, maybe he is.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:17.890
But the other side of it is, I
just told you what to do in

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:18.800
just a few words.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.960
It's Walmart Home Depot,
and internet stocks.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.460
And the other thing is, he
started liquidating in 2000,

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.440
right the peak of the market.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.030
So, it must be partly luck.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.170
The thing is, how did he know
that Walmart was a good

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.970
investment in 1954
[correction: 1974]?

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:42.650
I don't know.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:46.680
It's sort of -- he
took the risks.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.550
Maybe that's why --

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:53.300
I'm just digressing a little
bit to think about the way

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.930
things go in history.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.270
But it seems that --

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:02.330
I talked about the Forbes 400
people, and I mentioned last

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.950
lecture about Andrew Carnegie's
The Gospel of

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:09.310
Wealth, and he says that some
people are just very talented

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:12.660
and they make it really big,
and we should let them then

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.330
give their money away, and it's
kind of the American idea

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.020
that we let talented people
prove themselves in the real

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.410
marketplace and then they end
up becoming philanthropists

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.520
and guiding our society.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.060
But maybe they're just lucky.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.755
No one could have known
that Walmart was going

00:48:31.755 --> 00:48:34.530
to be such a success.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.550
And I think that history
is like that.

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.460
The people you read about in
history, these great men and

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.650
women of history, are often just
phenomenal risk takers

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.480
like Joe McNey.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.810
And for every one of them that
you read about, there's 1,000

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.820
of them that got squashed.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.050
I was reading the history
of Julius Caesar,

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.080
as written by Plutarch.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.710
It's a wonderful story.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.330
And I was reading this, and I
thought, this guy is a real

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.770
risk taker.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:05.200
You know, you read all the
details of his life.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.680
He just went for
it every time.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.250
And he ended up emperor
of Rome.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.920
But you know what happened to
him, he got assassinated.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.560
So, it was --

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.060
you know, it turned out not
entirely a happy story.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.390
So, maybe it's all those poor,
all those ordinary people,

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.920
living the little house,
the $400,000 house,

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.170
they don't risk it.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.330
Maybe they're the smart ones.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.080
You just don't ever
hear of them.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.010
Well, these are issues
for finance.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:38.760
But you wonder, what are all of
these things, all of these

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.190
big movements?

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.150
This is the worst one here,
where lost about a third of

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.820
its value in one month.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.100
And I researched it.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:48.690
What was it?

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.520
Does anyone know what
caused it in 2008?

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.350
Well, I'll tell you what caused
Apple to lose a third

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.300
of its value in one month.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.300
Steve Jobs, who is the founder
of Apple and genius behind the

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.860
company, gave a -- or was at
an annual meeting or press

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.090
conference, and people said,
he doesn't look well.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.620
And so, they recalled that he
had pancreatic cancer in 2004,

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.140
but the doctors then said it's
curable, no problem, so the

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.390
stock didn't do anything.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:22.950
But reporters called Apple
and said, is he ok?

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.270
And their company spokesman
wouldn't say anything.

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.890
So, it started a rumor
mill that Steve Jobs

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.450
was dying of cancer.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.860
It quickly rebounded
because he wasn't.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:40.240
That's how crazy these things
are, these market movements.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.530
So, now the next plot, and
this is important for our

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.420
concepts here.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.770
I can plot the same data
in different ways.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:52.500
This shows a different
sort of complexity.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.930
Let me just review what
we've seen here.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.580
We started out with
Apple stock.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.300
This is the stock price
normalized to 100 in 2000.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.300
OK?

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.190
And it goes up to 2500.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.090
Then, the next thing
I did is I did

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:11.610
capital gains as a percent.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.890
The percentage increase in
price for each month.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.940
It looks totally different, and
it shows such complexity

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.970
that I can't tell a
simple narrative.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.910
I've just told you about one
blip here, but they were so

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.250
many of these blips on the way,
and they all have some

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:31.250
story about the success of some
Apple product, or people

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:32.870
aren't buying some product.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.870
Every month looks different.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.250
But now, what I want to do --
and I have here the blue line

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.790
is the return of the S&amp;P 500.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:45.020
Now what I want to do is plot
a different sort of plot.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.390
It's a scatter plot.

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:50.890
I'm going to plot the return on
Apple against the return on

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.710
the S&amp;P 500, OK.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.900
Do you know what I'm
referring to here?

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.400
So, this is scatter plot.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.470
On the vertical axis I have the
return, it's actually the

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:08.080
capital gain on Apple, and on
the horizontal axis I have the

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.570
capital gain on the whole
stock market.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:11.610
OK?

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:15.700
And each point represents one
of the points that we saw on

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:21.720
the market.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.450
Actually I think it was,
I was telling you the

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.020
second lowest story.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.480
Steve Jobs, I'm not sure
which point it was.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.820
One of these points
in 2008 was when

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.220
Steve Jobs looked sick.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.780
So, each point is a month, and
I have the whole decade of

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:46.140
2000, of the beginning of
the 2000s, plotted.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:52.510
So, the best success was in
December, January of 2001,

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:57.280
where the stock price went
up 50% in one month.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.130
I tried to figure out
what that was about.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.170
Why'd they go up 50% percent
in one month?

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.550
It turns out that the preceding
two months it had

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:04.730
gone down a lot.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.340
They were down here somewhere.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.010
There were these big drops, and
people were getting really

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.110
pessimistic because Apple
products weren't going well.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:18.310
They had introduced some new
products, MobileMe, I think,

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:21.160
we forget about these products
that don't work, that didn't

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.040
work very well.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.030
And then somehow people decided
it really wasn't so

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:27.550
bad, so we have plus
50, almost 50%

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.800
return in one month.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.800
The reason why it looks kind of
compressed on this way is,

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.770
because the stock market doesn't
move as much as Apple.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:47.970
So, basically Apple return is
the sum of two components,

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:54.700
which is the overall market
return, and the idiosyncratic

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.800
return, OK.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:03.500
So, the return for a stock, for
the i-th stock, is equal

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:09.795
to the market return, which is
represented here by the S&amp;P

00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:15.140
500, which is pretty much the
whole stock market, plus

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.390
idiosyncratic return.

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.570
OK.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.790
And if they're independent of
each other, the variance of

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.010
the sum is the sum
of the variance.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:32.420
The variance of the stock
returns is the variance --

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.130
the variance of the Apple return
is the sum of their

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:41.830
market return and their
idiosyncratic return.

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.790
Well, let me be clear
about that.

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:47.080
Let's add a regression line
to the scatter point

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.030
[correction: scatter plot].

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.050
OK?

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.400
It's the same scatter that
you saw -- is it clear?

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.050
Everyone clear what
we're doing here?

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.620
I've got S&amp;P on this axis,
and Apple on this axis.

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.670
And now I've added a line, which
is a least-square fit,

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.530
which minimizes the
sum of squared

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.100
deviations from the line.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.110
It tries to get through
the scatter of points

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.330
as much as it can.

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:28.650
And the line has a
slope of 1.45.

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:31.910
We call that the beta,
all right?

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:36.990
These are concepts that I'm
asking Elan to elaborate for

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:38.550
you in the review session.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.110
But it's a simple idea here.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:47.160
What it means is that it seems
like Apple shows a magnified

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.670
response to the stock market.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.420
It goes up and down
approximately one and a half

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.110
times as much as the stock
market does on any day.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:05.570
So, the market return here is
equal to beta times the return

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.710
on the S&amp;P that you see here.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.090
So, I wonder why that is?

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:21.920
Why does Apple respond more
than one for one with the

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.740
stock market?

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.020
I guess it's because
the aggregate

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.480
economy matters, right?

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.770
If you think that maybe because
Apple is kind of a

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:35.550
vulnerable company, that if the
economy tanks, Apple will

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.310
tank even more than the economy,
than the aggregate

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:41.050
economy, because they're
such a volatile,

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:44.800
dangerous strategy company.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:51.990
And if the market goes
up, then it's even

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.650
better news for Apple.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:57:03.820
But even so, the idiosyncratic
risk just dominates.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.150
Look at these observations,
way up and way down here.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:10.410
Apple has a lot of idiosyncratic
risk.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:14.340
And I mentioned one example,
it's Steve Jobs' health.

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.510
The Steve Jobs story
is remarkable.

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.870
He founded Apple and Apple
prospered, and then he kind of

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.890
had a falling out with the
management, and got kind of

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.640
kicked out of his own company.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.030
And then he says, all right,
I'll start my own computer

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.360
company, my second,
I'll do it again.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.860
So, he founded Next Computer.

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.950
But meanwhile, Apple started
to really tank.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.270
This is in the nineties.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.310
And they finally realized they
needed Steve Jobs, so they

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.780
brought him back.

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:47.090
So, the company's ups and downs,
the idiosyncratic risk,

00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:50.790
has a lot to do with Steve Jobs,
and what he does, the

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:52.350
mistakes he made.

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:56.640
Those are what causes
these big movements.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640
This line, I thought it would
have an even higher beta.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.310
But I think it's this
point which is

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.620
bringing the beta down.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.340
And this is, I think this
is the point --

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.030
the month after it turns
out that Steve Jobs

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:09.590
really wasn't sick.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:10.430
OK?

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.200
And it turned out to be the same
month that's the Lehman

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.920
Brothers collapse occurred.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.530
So you see, this point here
is between September

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.980
and October of 2008.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.830
And that's the point --

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.840
it was September 15th that we
had the most significant

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.610
bankruptcy in U.S. history.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:29.655
Lehman Brothers, the

00:58:29.655 --> 00:58:31.400
investment bank, went bankrupt.

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.140
It threw the whole
world in chaos.

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.060
So, the stock market and S&amp;P
500 stock market return was

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:43.850
minus 16% in one month,
horrible drop.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:48.530
But for Apple, it really was
only about minus 5%, because

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.710
they're getting over the
news of Steve Jobs.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:55.140
So, that's the way
things work.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.750
So, I want to move on now to
next topic, which is outliers,

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:09.690
and talk about another
assumption that is made in

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:12.500
finance traditionally that
turned out to be

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.140
wrong in this episode.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.250
And the assumption is that
random shocks to the financial

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:23.890
economy are normally
distributed.

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.630
You must have heard of the
normal distribution.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:32.960
This is the bell-shaped, the
famous bell-shaped curve, that

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.890
was discovered by the
mathematician Gauss over a

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.810
hundred years ago.

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:44.780
The bell-shaped curve
is thought to be --

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:50.330
this particular bell-shaped
curve which is the --

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.820
the log of this curve
is a parabola.

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:58.780
It's a particular mathematical
function.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:06.310
The curve is thought by
statisticians to recur in

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.385
nature many different ways.

01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:12.500
It has a certain probability
law.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:18.260
So, I have plotted two normal
distributions, and I have them

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.840
for two different standard
deviations.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.290
One of them, black line, is the
standard deviation of 3,

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.460
and the other one, the pink
line, is the standard

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.000
deviation of 1.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.820
But they both look the same,
they're just scaled

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.850
differently.

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:35.290
And these distributions have
the property that the area

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:39.520
under the curve is equal to 1
and the area between any two

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.730
points, say between minus 5 and
minus 10, the area under

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.480
this curve is the probability
that the random variable falls

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.590
between minus 5 and minus 10.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:54.450
So, a lot of probability theory
works on the assumption

01:00:54.450 --> 01:01:00.000
that variables are normally
distributed.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.570
But random variables have a
habit of not behaving that

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:11.530
way, especially in finance it
seems. And so, we had a

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:15.060
mathematician here in the Yale
math department, Benoit

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.870
Mandelbrot, who was really the
discoverer of this concept,

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:24.152
and I think the most important
figure in it.

01:01:24.152 --> 01:01:24.328
[correction: Pierre Paul Levy
invented the concept, as

01:01:24.328 --> 01:01:24.438
discussed in the
next lecture.]

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:31.850
He said that in nature the
normal distribution is not the

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:35.260
only distribution that occurs,
and that especially in certain

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.230
kinds of circumstances we have
more fat-tailed distributions.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:44.160
So, this blue line is the normal
distribution, and the

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.990
pink line that I've shown is a
fat-tailed distribution that

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:51.100
Mandelbrot talked about,
called the Cauchy

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.250
distribution.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.890
You see how it differs?

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:57.860
The pink line looks pretty
much the same.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.230
They're both bell-shaped
curves, right?

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:05.350
But the pink line has
tremendously large probability

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.710
of being far out.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.960
These are the tails of
the distribution.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:17.140
So, if you observe a random
variable that looks --

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.320
you observe it for a while,
maybe you get 100

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.960
observations, you probably can't
tell it apart very well

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.170
from a normal distribution.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.910
Whether it's Cauchy or normal,
they look about the same.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:32.780
The way you find out that
they're not the same, is that

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.680
in extremely rare circumstances
there'll be a

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.700
sudden major jump in the
variable that you might have

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.950
thought couldn't happen.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:52.420
So, I have here a plot of a
histogram of stock price

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:58.920
movements from 1928, every
day, I've taken every day

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.750
since 1928, and I've
shown what the S&amp;P

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.440
Composite Index --

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.080
it didn't have 500 stocks in
1928, so I can't call it S&amp;P

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.990
500 for the whole period --

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:18.550
but this is essentially
the S&amp;P 500.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:19.600
And I have every day.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.650
There's something like
40,000 days.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:27.030
And what this line here shows is
that the stock return, the

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:31.120
percentage change in stock price
in one day, was between

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.490
0 and 1% over 9,000 times.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:43.750
And it was between 0 and minus
1 percent around 8,000 times.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.000
OK?

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.700
So, that's typical per day.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.080
You know, it's less than
1% up or down.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.960
But occasionally, we'll
have a 2% day.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.540
This is between 1 and 2%, that
occurred about 2,000 times.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:03.520
And about 2,000 times we had
between minus 1% and minus 2%.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.340
And then, you can see
that we've had --

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.870
you can see these
outliers here.

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.750
These look like outliers,
they're not extreme outliers.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:18.180
So, if you look at a small
number of data, you get an

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.720
impression that well, you know,
the stock market goes up

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.210
between plus or minus 2%,
usually not so much, that's

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.030
the way it is.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.100
After here they don't seem to be
anything, which means that,

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.050
it looks like you never see
anything more than up

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:38.110
or down 5% or 6%.

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:40.260
It just doesn't happen.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.270
Well, because it's so few days
that it does those extremes.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.070
Can you see these little --

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:48.580
that's between 5 and 6.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.090
There were maybe like 20 days,
I can't read off the chart

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.280
when it did this since 1928.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.670
You can go through ten years on
Wall Street and never see a

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.150
drop of that magnitude.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.700
So, eventually you get
kind of assured.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.180
It can't happen.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.210
What about an 8% drop?

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:10.070
Well, I look at this, I say,
I've never seen that.

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:12.960
You know, I've been watching
this now, I've seen thousands

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.280
of days, and I've
never seen that.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960
But I have here the
two extremes.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:26.000
Stock market went up 12.53%
on October 30, 1929.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.330
That's the biggest
one-day increase.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.140
That's way off the charts, and
if you compute the normal

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.020
distribution, what's the
probability of that?

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.820
If it's a normal distribution
and it fits the central

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.600
portion, it would say
it's virtually zero.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.510
It couldn't happen.

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:49.410
Anyone have any idea what
happened on October 30, 1929?

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:53.190
It's obvious to me, but it's
not obvious to you.

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.950
I'm asking you to --

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.350
I won't ask.

01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:59.430
What happened in October, does
anyone know what happened in

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.190
October 1929?

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.595
STUDENT: That must be right
before the crash.

01:06:03.595 --> 01:06:05.230
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
You're close.

01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:06.980
You're right.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.650
But someone else?

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:07.960
STUDENT: Wasn't it the rebound
after the crash?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.160
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Yes,
absolutely, it was the rebound

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.730
after the crash.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:16.970
The stock market crash of 1929
had two consecutive days.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:19.460
Boy is that probability,
independence

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.540
doesn't seem right.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.870
It went down about 12% on
October 28, and then the next

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:26.240
day it did it again.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.400
What's going on here?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.170
We were down like
24% in two days.

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:33.540
People got up on the 30th and
said, oh my God, is it going

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.880
to do that again?

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.840
But it did just the opposite.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.130
It was going totally wild.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.655
So, we don't know whether
covariance broke down or not.

01:06:41.655 --> 01:06:44.160
I guess it didn't, because it
rebounded, and that was the

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.510
biggest one-day increase ever.

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:50.600
But if that weren't enough,
however, let's go back to

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.930
October 19, 1987.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:58.760
It went down 20.47%
in one day.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.660
It went down even
more on the Dow.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.360
Some people say it went down
more than that, didn't it?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.970
But on the S&amp;P that's how
much it went down.

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:10.530
So, I figured, well if this were
normally distributed with

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:14.310
the standard deviation suggested
by this, what's the

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:20.700
probability of a decline
that's that negative?

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.650
It's 10 to the minus 71 power.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.910
1 over 10.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:29.750
So, you take 1 and you divide
that by 1 followed by

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.730
seventy-one zeros.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:34.160
That's an awfully
small number.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.400
If you believe in normality,
October 19,

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.110
1987 couldn't happen.

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:40.950
But there it is.

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:41.690
It happened.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.300
And in fact, I was, I told you
I've been teaching this course

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.510
for 25 years.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:52.280
I was giving a lecture, not in
this room, but nearby here,

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.090
and I was talking about
something else.

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.530
And a student had a
transistor radio.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.530
Remember transistor radios?

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.160
And he was holding it up
and listening to it.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.875
Then he raised his
hand and said, do

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:08.660
you know what's happening?

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.510
He said the stock market is
totally falling apart.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.950
It just came as a complete
surprise to me.

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:17.545
So, after class, I didn't
go back to my office.

01:08:17.545 --> 01:08:20.070
I went downtown to
Merrill Lynch.

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:23.400
And I walked up, it's a
story I like to tell.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.990
It's not that good.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.250
I walked up and I talked to a
stockbroker there, and I said,

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.280
I was about to say something,
but he didn't let me talk.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.490
He said, don't panic.

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:38.400
He thought that I had shown up
as a someone who was losing

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.660
everything, his life savings
all in one day.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.080
And he said, don't worry,
it's not going to --

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.010
it's going to rebound.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.300
It didn't rebound.

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:53.750
I showed up at lunchtime
and it kept going down.

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.900
So, anyway, there was
something wrong with

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.430
independence.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.410
Let me just recap.

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:03.320
The two themes are that
independence leads to the law

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.680
of large numbers, and it leads
to some sort of stability.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.870
Either independence
through time or

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.720
independence across stocks.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.640
So, if you diversify through
time or you diversify across

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.950
stocks, you're supposed
to be safe.

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:19.450
But that's not what happened in
this crisis and that's the

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.180
big question.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.460
And then it's fat-tails, which
is kind of related.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.050
But it's that distributions
fool you.

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:32.230
You get big incredible shocks
that you thought couldn't

01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:35.230
happen, and they just come
up with a certain low

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:38.480
probability, but with a certain
regularity in finance.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.510
All right, I'll stop there.

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:41.865
I'll see you on next Wednesday.

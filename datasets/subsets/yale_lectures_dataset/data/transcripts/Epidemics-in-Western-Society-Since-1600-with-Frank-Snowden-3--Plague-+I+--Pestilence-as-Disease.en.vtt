00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.712
Prof: Well,
what we'll do this morning is

00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:06.090
to start right now.
 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.033
And we'll be dealing today with
the beginnings of our first

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.210
major epidemic in the course.
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.940
We'll be talking about bubonic
plague.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.729
This time we'll have an
overview of bubonic plague and

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:27.880
its passage through Western
society.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.818
And then in the next two
classes we'll look at specific

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:38.006
features of bubonic plague;
next time, community responses

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.219
to the plague,
and the time after that,

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.530
the impact on society,
and in particular on European

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.630
culture.
 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.420
So, that's where we're headed.
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.950
And this morning we'll have a
sort of overview.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.392
Now, one of the reasons for
dealing first with the plague is

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:02.835
that it's very important as part
of testing the theme of our

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:06.007
course;
the theme being--one of the

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.561
themes--that epidemic diseases
aren't just interchangeable

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.724
causes of illness and death;
that each one has its own

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:18.161
particular history that is
determined by a number of

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.790
variables that we'll be looking
at,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.875
such as virulence,
the nature of the symptoms of

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.390
the disease,
and a number of others.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.081
And we'll be testing the theory
too that epidemic diseases are

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:40.884
major determinants of historical
change, and have major impacts

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:42.530
on society.
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.970
Well, plague,
in a sense, set the standard by

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.019
which all other epidemics are
judged.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:51.584
The plague was,
we might call it,

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:55.425
the worst-case scenario,
and we'll see that in later

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.980
centuries,
when societies experienced some

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.480
new and unfamiliar disease,
they waited anxiously to see if

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.020
those diseases would be similar
in their impact.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.620
And especially terrible
diseases like cholera,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.360
in the nineteenth century,
and influenza,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.227
just after the First World War,
were said to be "the

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.229
return of the plague."
 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.855
Tuberculosis,
the great killer of the

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:27.211
nineteenth century,
was known also as "the

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:28.889
white plague."
 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.449
What were some of the
distinctive features of bubonic

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:34.240
plague?
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.280
The first thing that stands out
is its extreme virulence.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.512
That's one of the first words
that we may want to define as we

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:44.370
move on.
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.426
By that I mean its capacity to
cause harm and symptoms in the

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:51.740
human body.
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.333
It's a measurement of the
ability of a pathogen to cause

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.348
disease.
 

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:02.379
Plague in that sense was highly
virulent.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.780
It also struck rapidly.
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.860
It caused excruciating and
degrading symptoms,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.639
and it achieved a case fatality
rate--

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.405
another technical term,
which simply means the kill

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:17.740
rate that a disease achieved.
 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.634
In the case of bubonic plague,
it normally killed fifty to

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.780
seventy percent of the patients
it infected;

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.680
a rate attained by few other
diseases.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.628
Its course in the human body
was also terrifyingly swift.

00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:38.578
Normally it killed within about
three days of the first

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:40.870
appearance of symptoms.
 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.696
Another feature that was
characteristic of bubonic plague

00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:48.538
was the profile of its victims.
 

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:53.417
I mean that both in terms of
their age and their social

00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:54.139
class.
 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.312
Familiar endemic childhood
diseases in a society tend to

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:05.250
strike primarily children and
the elderly.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.915
That, if you like,
would be the normal experience

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.819
of society with infectious
diseases.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.438
But the plague was different.
 

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:17.860
It struck men and women in the
prime of life.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.511
And this fact,
among others,

00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:25.422
made plague seem like an
unnatural, or might we say

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:27.778
supernatural,
event.

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:32.129
It also magnified the economic
and social dislocations it

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.829
caused.
 

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:36.636
In other words,
plague left in its wake vast

00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:41.240
numbers of orphans,
widows and destitute families.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.168
Furthermore,
the plague, unlike most

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:48.271
epidemic diseases,
did not show a predilection for

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:49.360
the poor.
 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.154
It struck universally,
again magnifying a sense that

00:04:54.154 --> 00:04:59.699
this was the final day of
reckoning, a divine visitation.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.398
Another feature of plague we'll
be looking at is terror as a

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:07.040
response to it.
 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.233
All of the things that we'll be
saying about plague magnified

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:14.939
the responses of the societies
that were afflicted.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.870
Plague was associated with mass
hysteria;

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.949
with terror;
with violence;

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.483
with religious revivals,
as people sought to assuage the

00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:27.720
divine wrath.
 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.338
It was associated with
scapegoating and witch-hunts,

00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:34.956
for the guilty people in
society responsible for the

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:35.879
disaster.
 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:41.139
Perhaps those were the sinful,
for those who saw the disease

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.279
as divine retribution.
 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:48.723
Or it could be a search for the
homicidal agents of some human

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:53.720
conspiracy, for the demonic
interpretation of disease.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.439
Those might be foreigners,
witches, Jews or poisoners.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.697
Then the plague was important
because it generated a major

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:09.939
societal response:
the development of the first

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.430
forms of public health.
 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.290
In part because of its very
virulence,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.214
the plague inspired the first
and most extreme form of public

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:24.401
health policy to protect
populations and contain the

00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:28.589
spread of this horrendous and
terrible disease.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.668
Plague public health--and we'll
see this more next

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:37.745
time--involved a military style
policy carried out by the army

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.160
and the navy.
 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.399
It involved maritime and
land-based quarantines,

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:48.970
sanitary cordons,
which are military lines

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.980
isolating a population.
 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.149
It gave rise to pest houses or
lazarettos.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.079
And to new health
authorities--variously called,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.653
over the centuries,
health magistrates or boards of

00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:05.485
health--
equipped with extraordinary

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:08.540
powers to enforce the plague
measures.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.437
In some places there were
erected stocks and scaffolds to

00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:18.600
remind the population of the
powers of these authorities.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.620
Early Italian states,
at the time of the Renaissance,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.151
devoted a special
role--deserved a special role as

00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.610
the inventors of these public
health measures.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.343
This was thrust upon them by
their vulnerable position at the

00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:40.839
geographic center of trade
routes in the Mediterranean.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:44.887
So, we'll see the decisive role
in the development of these

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:49.144
measures was played by places
like Florence and the great port

00:07:49.144 --> 00:07:53.759
cities like Genoa,
Naples, Venice.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.899
Later centuries will see
another pattern,

00:07:56.899 --> 00:08:01.850
when a new, mysterious and
frightful disease strikes--

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.923
say cholera,
yellow fever or AIDS--one of

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:10.913
the first responses of
authorities is to return to

00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:14.579
plague measures of self-defense.
 

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:19.196
It's said of generals that they
always try to fight the last war

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:23.519
over again, often confronting
new enemies with inappropriate

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:24.620
strategies.
 

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.624
The same might be said of
public health authorities over

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:29.790
the centuries.
 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.090
And this temptation is all the
greater for authorities because

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.109
the battery of anti-plague
defenses gives an impression of

00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:40.928
taking forceful and decisive
action;

00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:43.975
providing the population,
in other words,

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:46.259
with some sense of security.
 

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:52.056
A third feature of the plague
is its enormous impact on

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:53.129
society.
 

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:57.178
As we've said,
infectious diseases are not

00:08:57.178 --> 00:09:00.340
narrow, specialized interests.
 

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.808
They're often part of the big
picture,

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:08.214
as essential for understanding
a society and its history as

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.216
studying war,
religion, economics,

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.629
high politics and culture.
 

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:17.916
I'm not trying to make a case
for disease determinism,

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:22.928
and I'm not what you might want
to call a microbial Marxist.

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:28.495
My argument instead is simply
that certain diseases do have a

00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:33.970
transforming effect on society,
plague being one of them.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.575
Certain others do not,
even great killers such as

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:40.590
polio or influenza.
 

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.947
We're going to examine why this
major difference--why some

00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:51.399
diseases have a much more
lasting footprint than others.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:56.172
Bubonic plague was a disease
that affected every aspect of

00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:57.009
society.
 

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:00.330
It transformed the demography
of Europe.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.899
Recurring cycles of plague,
with an epidemic every

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.149
generation,
constituted a major break on

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:10.974
population between the
fourteenth century and the

00:10:10.974 --> 00:10:12.090
eighteenth.
 

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.751
It had devastating effect on
economic life and economic

00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:17.528
growth.
 

00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:23.120
It also had a major impact on
religion and popular culture.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.490
It gave rise to a new piety,
to cults of plague saints,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.379
to passion plays.
 

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:34.845
Plague led to an outpouring of
sermons and religious pamphlets,

00:10:34.845 --> 00:10:38.950
with a central theme being what
we might call theodicy;

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.529
that is, how do you justify
God's ways towards men?

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:48.634
A just and loving God could be
angry and punish sinners who

00:10:48.634 --> 00:10:50.899
turned from him and disobeyed.
 

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:55.129
But how were priests and
ministers to explain the

00:10:55.129 --> 00:11:00.594
gruesome suffering and death of
innocents, and in particular of

00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:01.740
children?
 

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.690
Thus also we see another
undertow.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.500
We talked about piety.
 

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.308
I would argue that plague also
led sometimes to its opposite;

00:11:12.308 --> 00:11:17.000
the terrifying conclusion that
how could there be a good God,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.496
because a loving and
all-powerful being would not

00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:24.649
take the lives of half the
population of a great city,

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:28.960
indiscriminately killing men,
women and children.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.227
So, for some,
the result wasn't an act of

00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:36.639
atheism but a mute despair that
was not articulated;

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:41.618
a psychological impact that
with historical hindsight we

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:45.240
might even call post-traumatic
stress.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.570
So, plague had a major
psychological impact on the

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.724
relationship of human beings to
their mortality,

00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:55.580
and to their god.
 

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.450
Plague had a major impact on
the arts and culture.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.121
In literature we'll be
seeing--and in fact you're

00:12:03.121 --> 00:12:05.313
starting to see,
I hope already,

00:12:05.313 --> 00:12:09.325
by reading Defoe--that there's
a whole genre of plague

00:12:09.325 --> 00:12:12.513
literature,
including not only Defoe but

00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:16.149
names like Boccaccio,
Camus, Manzoni;

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:17.759
of whom more later.
 

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:21.815
It affected European painting
profoundly, and we'll be looking

00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:22.480
at that.
 

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.554
It affected architecture,
with large numbers of churches

00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:30.259
dedicated to the redeemer and
the plague saints.

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:34.385
It led to sculpture,
and plague columns appeared

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:38.250
throughout Vienna and the
Austrian cities.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.672
We have, even in modern times,
the film that I hope you'll be

00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:45.990
seeing, The Seventh Seal
by Bergman.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:51.269
Plague also had a major impact
intellectually on the medical

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.240
paradigm of disease.
 

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.149
Plague profoundly tested the
humoral framework of disease.

00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:04.342
And we can see this in a man I
mentioned in the last lecture,

00:13:04.342 --> 00:13:08.238
Girolamo Fracastoro,
who developed a theory of

00:13:08.238 --> 00:13:09.710
contagionism.
 

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.216
Now, the humoral idea,
and Hippocrates,

00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:18.754
had recognized the difficulty
that epidemics pose for humoral

00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:19.769
theory.
 

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:24.674
How is it possible to account
for vast numbers of people

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:30.027
experiencing the same humoral
imbalance at precisely the same

00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:30.830
time?
 

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:36.778
Well, Fracastoro took that idea
and he eliminated the mediation

00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:40.990
of the humors,
suggesting instead that the

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.288
disease was caused by a
poisonous chemical,

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:48.559
transmitted in a way he didn't
understand,

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:51.259
from one person to another.
 

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:56.191
But let's not think of
Fracastoro as a modern medical

00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:57.330
scientist.
 

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.445
He thought that plague was
caused, not by a living entity,

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:04.240
but by a chemical.
 

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.620
That's the background, then.
 

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.407
Let's remember the history of
three pandemics of bubonic

00:14:13.407 --> 00:14:16.879
plague that afflicted the West.
 

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:19.798
Now, first maybe we should
define what we mean.

00:14:19.798 --> 00:14:24.385
An outbreak--let's talk about
three terms--an outbreak,

00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.850
an epidemic and a pandemic.
 

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:33.423
An outbreak is a small surge in
morbidity and mortality in a

00:14:33.423 --> 00:14:34.649
locality.
 

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:39.679
So, we might talk of an
outbreak of influenza in New

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:40.470
Haven.
 

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:47.240
An epidemic is a much bigger
surge, over a larger area.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.379
And a pandemic is when an
epidemic goes transnational;

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:57.659
becomes an international
phenomenon, affecting whole

00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:01.269
continents, or occasionally
going global.

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:05.490
The plague struck the West in
three pandemic waves.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.639
We'll be talking about the
history, then,

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.710
of three pandemics of bubonic
plague.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:17.783
And each pandemic as a subset,
if we like, had a series of

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:24.070
recurring visitations that might
even last for centuries.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.856
And in addition to being
cyclical in that sense,

00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:30.918
plague had a pronounced
seasonality.

00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:35.614
An epidemic of bubonic plague
usually began in the spring or

00:15:35.614 --> 00:15:39.115
summer months,
and faded away with the coming

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:40.230
of winter.
 

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.081
Especially favorable were
months that were both hot and

00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:44.509
wet.
 

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:47.144
The explanation for that,
as we'll see,

00:15:47.144 --> 00:15:48.740
wasn't a humoral one.
 

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.846
But that provides an ideal
environment for fleas,

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:57.807
which are decisive in plague,
and their need for warmth and

00:15:57.807 --> 00:16:01.058
humidity, for their eggs to
hatch;

00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:07.038
and they become inactive in
cold or very dry climate.

00:16:07.038 --> 00:16:09.970
The first pandemic,
when was that?

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.427
That lasted for two centuries
after 541 A.D.,

00:16:14.427 --> 00:16:18.480
and is called the Plague of
Justinian.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.187
It was the first appearance of
bubonic plague as a major player

00:16:24.187 --> 00:16:28.423
in world history,
and there are estimates that it

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:31.745
afflicted Africa,
Asia and Europe with--people

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:35.048
are guessing,
but there are figures bandied

00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:38.548
about of perhaps a hundred
million victims.

00:16:38.548 --> 00:16:41.950
There are few accounts,
or records that have survived,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.028
and there's some debate about
whether this so-called Plague of

00:16:46.028 --> 00:16:48.970
Justinian was even bubonic
plague at all,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.259
or whether it was some other
disease.

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:55.000
But as we speak,
paleopathologists are at work

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.572
exhuming bodies from ancient
cemeteries in order to find

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:04.308
conclusive DNA evidence to
support a firm diagnosis,

00:17:04.308 --> 00:17:08.876
and the latest news is that
they're pretty certain that it

00:17:08.876 --> 00:17:10.558
was bubonic plague.
 

00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:16.069
The second pandemic occurred
from the 1330s,

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:20.940
in the Middle East,
until the 1830s.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.598
So, we have--what's that?--five
centuries of bubonic plague in

00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:28.640
the second pandemic.
 

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.828
It began with what was called
the Black Death.

00:17:31.828 --> 00:17:37.954
This erupted in Central Asia in
the 1330s, and first invaded

00:17:37.954 --> 00:17:39.720
Europe in 1347.
 

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.579
And the early years,
from 1347 into the 1350s,

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:48.470
were usually called the Black
Death, which referred to the

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.730
first wave of the second
pandemic;

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.355
after which it's usually
referred to simply as bubonic

00:17:56.355 --> 00:17:59.150
plague, plague,
or pestilence.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:04.300
It may well--and this is the
common theory--have arrived

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:09.920
aboard a Genoese merchant ship
that had sailed from the Black

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.730
Sea in the summer of 1347.
 

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.284
In any case,
Italy was the first land to be

00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:19.503
invaded by the disease;
again, as I say,

00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:22.612
not by chance,
because Italy was at the center

00:18:22.612 --> 00:18:25.720
of the trade routes of the
Mediterranean,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.210
and therefore was always,
at this time,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.930
permanently at risk.
 

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.911
About a third of the population
of Europe is estimated to have

00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:36.808
perished.
 

00:18:36.808 --> 00:18:42.098
And after the 1350s,
after the Black Death,

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:46.460
the plague returned more or
less once in a generation,

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.516
for a number of centuries,
with some famous local

00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:51.529
epidemics.
 

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:55.358
Let me just remember some of
the worst cases.

00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:59.147
Florence in 1348,
when the disease killed half

00:18:59.147 --> 00:19:04.030
the population--and that's
portrayed vividly in Boccaccio's

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:10.750
Decameron;
1576 to 1577, Milan;

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.329
1630, again Milan--and there
are two major plague works of

00:19:15.329 --> 00:19:19.509
literature: Manzoni's novel
The Betrothed,

00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:22.240
and his work The Column of
Infamy--

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.015
1656 in Naples;
and 1665 and 1666 in London,

00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:31.580
which you're reading about in
Dafoe's Journal of the Plague

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.480
Year.
 

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.269
Then for reasons we're going to
return to,

00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:39.464
the plague was vanquished in
Western Europe between the end

00:19:39.464 --> 00:19:43.950
of the seventeenth century and
the middle of the eighteenth.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:49.114
The last outbreaks in Western
Europe, of the second pandemic,

00:19:49.114 --> 00:19:52.730
were 1720 to 1722,
at Marseilles in France,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.690
the last on the Western
European mainland;

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.690
and in 1743 at Messina and
Sicily.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.664
Interestingly,
Messina is a convenient

00:20:03.664 --> 00:20:07.048
bookend;
the very first place in Western

00:20:07.048 --> 00:20:11.624
Europe to be afflicted by the
plague, and also the last,

00:20:11.624 --> 00:20:14.118
during the second pandemic.
 

00:20:14.118 --> 00:20:18.318
Now, don't make the mistake of
assuming that the virulence of

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.328
the plague declines over these
centuries.

00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:24.778
In many cases the last
epidemics of the seventeenth or

00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:28.358
eighteenth century were the most
devastating of all,

00:20:28.358 --> 00:20:33.858
including the experience of
London that you're reading

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:34.690
about.
 

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:41.374
Then we come to the third
pandemic, which lasted from

00:20:41.374 --> 00:20:45.873
about 1855 until 1959,
more or less,

00:20:45.873 --> 00:20:48.828
when it fades away.
 

00:20:48.828 --> 00:20:53.583
It began in earnest,
and attracted world attention

00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:59.210
in China, when it attacked Hong
Kong and Canton in 1894.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.023
And, as I said,
it lasted until the middle of

00:21:02.023 --> 00:21:03.558
the twentieth century.
 

00:21:03.558 --> 00:21:08.863
Now, this pandemic ravaged
India and affected five

00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:12.935
countries,
but mostly not the industrial

00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:17.160
West,
apart from a brief flare-up in

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.573
Naples in 1899,
and an also limited outbreak in

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:26.108
San Francisco in the early years
of the twentieth century.

00:21:26.108 --> 00:21:30.731
That's the topic of Marilyn
Chase's work that you'll be

00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:33.900
reading, The Barbary
Plague.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.674
It was the steamship that
enabled plague to reach the New

00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:43.108
World for the first time in the
twentieth century.

00:21:43.108 --> 00:21:47.508
It had limited impact on
humans, but it did establish a

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:51.906
stable reservoir of infection
among wild rodents in the

00:21:51.906 --> 00:21:57.412
southwest of the United States,
where it persists to this very

00:21:57.412 --> 00:22:01.869
day and causes an ongoing
trickle of cases of bubonic

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:04.098
plague in this country.
 

00:22:04.098 --> 00:22:09.859
The great disaster was India
from 1898 to 1908,

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:16.872
which experienced some 13
million deaths from the bubonic

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:18.250
plague.
 

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.310
Present day plague--and I think
a number of you may have the

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.097
idea that plague is something
medieval that doesn't have

00:22:26.097 --> 00:22:28.990
anything to do with the modern
world,

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.960
and I want to make it clear
that plague is not extinct.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.608
Indeed, I have a friend myself
who is a survivor of bubonic

00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:42.338
plague, which she contracted in
Arizona in the southwest.

00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:47.010
As I said, it continues to
cause a trickle of cases every

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:52.961
year in the United States,
because it persists in the wild

00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:58.262
animal population,
and there are occasional

00:22:58.262 --> 00:22:59.650
flare-ups.
 

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.703
We also need to remember
there's a somber background

00:23:03.703 --> 00:23:07.315
threat,
then, of bubonic plague even

00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:11.155
today,
which is made more vivid by the

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:16.248
threat possibly of bubonic
plague as an instrument of

00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:17.618
bio-terror.
 

00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:23.632
And just to show the sort of
modern--here's a modern image of

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:27.140
the grim reaper as still with
us.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.280
Now, our focus here in our
class will be instead firmly on

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.160
the second pandemic,
and especially its last

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.490
terrible century in Europe,
the seventeenth.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.683
Let's talk about some of the
features of bubonic plague,

00:23:44.683 --> 00:23:47.430
and we'll begin with its
etiology.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:52.144
Again a bit of jargon,
and by that I simply mean the

00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:55.380
causes or origins of the
disease.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.952
And the plague is a disease
with a complex history of four

00:24:00.952 --> 00:24:02.420
protagonists.
 

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.628
First there's the
bacterium--and there it

00:24:06.628 --> 00:24:11.259
is--Yersinia pestis,
sometimes called,

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:17.470
in a more old-fashioned way,
Pasteurella pestis.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.500
It was discovered in Hong Kong
by Alexander Yersin,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.214
a Swiss student of Louis
Pasteur, and at the same time by

00:24:27.214 --> 00:24:30.890
his rival the Japanese
physician,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:37.472
Shibasaburo Kitasato,
a prot�g� instead of Robert

00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:38.358
Koch.
 

00:24:38.358 --> 00:24:42.324
So, the first protagonist is
this bacterium,

00:24:42.324 --> 00:24:44.630
Yersinia pestis.
 

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.259
And then there are two vectors.
 

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:51.835
The vector is normally another
bit of jargon:

00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:58.385
An animal or insect responsible
for conveying a disease to human

00:24:58.385 --> 00:24:59.529
beings.
 

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:05.571
And in this case there are two
vectors or carriers that convey

00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:10.127
the disease to human beings:
fleas and rodents,

00:25:10.127 --> 00:25:12.108
especially rats.
 

00:25:12.108 --> 00:25:17.548
And then there's the fourth
protagonist, you and me.

00:25:17.548 --> 00:25:24.250
By between 1894 and 1898,
Yersin and his colleague,

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.676
Paul-Louis Simond,
unraveled the complex

00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:31.753
relationship among rats,
fleas and humans,

00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:36.483
and the bacterium,
that governs the epidemiology

00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:38.269
of bubonic plague.
 

00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:42.029
Normally the plague began as an
infection,

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:48.250
an epidemic among animals and
especially wild rodents:

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.249
hamsters,
gerbils, prairie dogs,

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.140
chipmunks, squirrels in their
burrows,

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.519
where underground catastrophes,
unknown to humans,

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:59.288
took place.
 

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:03.109
A particularly important moment
was when it inflicted this

00:26:03.109 --> 00:26:07.762
particular creature and friend,
that lives not so distant from

00:26:07.762 --> 00:26:12.250
us, Rattus rattus,
the black rat or ship rat;

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.630
and as you see,
extremely cute it is.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.374
Unlike his cousin,
the brown rat,

00:26:19.374 --> 00:26:23.490
that took over its ecological
niche later on,

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.180
and is more familiar in modern
times,

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.259
the black rat was definitely
not shy,

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:33.230
but lived in close proximity to
people,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.880
with whom they shared the same
dietary preferences.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.240
So, the rat was extremely
important.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:47.897
The bacterium was spread in a
third major character,

00:26:47.897 --> 00:26:55.338
the flea, a highly efficient
vector for bubonic plague.

00:26:55.338 --> 00:27:00.480
The flea is naturally parasitic
on warm-blooded animals.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.203
In a single feed it sucks up an
amount of blood equal to its own

00:27:05.203 --> 00:27:05.880
weight.
 

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.915
I'm talking about something
like a billion bacteria at a

00:27:09.915 --> 00:27:10.430
time.
 

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.804
And here we're looking at the
slide of a flea engorged with

00:27:15.804 --> 00:27:17.750
blood after a meal.
 

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:22.506
Now, once infected--and here
you'll feel sorry for the poor

00:27:22.506 --> 00:27:26.769
flea--the flea does not survive
the plague either.

00:27:26.769 --> 00:27:32.497
The bacterium blocks the gut of
the flea, causing it to starve

00:27:32.497 --> 00:27:33.529
to death.
 

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:35.509
Poor thing.
 

00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:39.720
But before dying,
in a frenzied bid to survive,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.131
the flea feeds repeatedly,
and in each bite inoculates

00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:48.959
perhaps a hundred thousand
bacteria into the bloodstream of

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:51.288
its warm-blooded victim.
 

00:27:51.288 --> 00:27:55.848
So, when a rodent host of fleas
sickens and dies,

00:27:55.848 --> 00:28:01.548
the fleas leap to the warm body
of another mammal that passes

00:28:01.548 --> 00:28:04.019
within leaping radius.
 

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:09.247
And the flea also is capable of
hibernating for as much as a

00:28:09.247 --> 00:28:12.259
couple of months,
lying in wait.

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:17.128
Now, how did human beings come
to be involved in this

00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:18.440
catastrophe?
 

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.939
Well, it might be sometimes
that the remote steppes where

00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:27.838
wild rodents lived had their
ecological systems disrupted,

00:28:27.838 --> 00:28:33.068
perhaps by floods or droughts,
that sent animals scurrying

00:28:33.068 --> 00:28:37.493
over long distances,
and then they encountered other

00:28:37.493 --> 00:28:40.930
rodents who lived in close
proximity to man,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:45.279
and especially our friend the
black rat.

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:48.612
Alternatively,
human beings invaded rodents'

00:28:48.612 --> 00:28:52.098
habitats, exposing themselves to
infection;

00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:56.306
soldiers perhaps,
or refugees in times of war,

00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:58.828
or hunters and shepherds.
 

00:28:58.828 --> 00:29:04.131
So, the first foci--that is,
the first locuses where

00:29:04.131 --> 00:29:08.808
infections sprang up amongst
human beings--

00:29:08.808 --> 00:29:13.382
were the first infected men and
women which shared their fleas

00:29:13.382 --> 00:29:17.430
and infection with other members
of their household.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.664
The plague would then begin,
not as a disease so much of

00:29:21.664 --> 00:29:24.900
isolated individuals,
but of households.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.190
Housing conditions were
important.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.355
Overcrowding,
with whole families sleeping in

00:29:31.355 --> 00:29:35.143
a single bed,
facilitated the exchange of

00:29:35.143 --> 00:29:36.088
fleas.
 

00:29:36.088 --> 00:29:39.946
And there were particular
moments that were especially

00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:44.314
dangerous, such as the laying
out and final attentions to the

00:29:44.314 --> 00:29:44.970
dead.
 

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:50.067
As the body cooled,
the fleas infesting it became

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:56.440
desperate to escape to the next
warm body that approached;

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.380
quite possibly you and me.
 

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:05.080
Then there was the wider spread;
and this was dependent on

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.808
networks of trade and commerce.
 

00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:12.147
It was not an accident that
plague emerged when it did in

00:30:12.147 --> 00:30:13.618
European history.
 

00:30:13.618 --> 00:30:17.626
It spread overland and along
river valleys,

00:30:17.626 --> 00:30:19.440
by river traffic.
 

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.134
Now, fleas obviously are
severely restricted in their

00:30:24.134 --> 00:30:28.558
range, but rats are really
wonderful travelers.

00:30:28.558 --> 00:30:32.448
They hide in the shipments of
wheat and are transported

00:30:32.448 --> 00:30:33.240
overland.
 

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.460
They travel by barge down
waterways.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.471
But the garments of victims
were also important,

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:42.328
because they were recycled.
 

00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:47.277
Remember how precious an item
of clothing was in the early

00:30:47.277 --> 00:30:48.578
modern world.
 

00:30:48.578 --> 00:30:53.357
And, so, the clothing of dead
men and women was packed in

00:30:53.357 --> 00:30:58.561
crates, and sold in markets and
fairs, often with fleas intact

00:30:58.561 --> 00:31:00.440
among their folds.
 

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.455
Certain professions were also
highly at risk:

00:31:04.455 --> 00:31:08.092
street vendors,
market-stall-holders,

00:31:08.092 --> 00:31:10.750
washerwomen,
gravediggers,

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:16.220
physicians, priests,
and also millers and bakers,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.875
because of the dietary
preferences of your friend the

00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:21.950
black rat.
 

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.823
But the disease also went
further afield,

00:31:25.823 --> 00:31:28.048
and it did so by sea.
 

00:31:28.048 --> 00:31:32.392
And shipping was essential to
the spread of the plague over

00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:35.237
long distance,
and helps to explain its

00:31:35.237 --> 00:31:37.751
epidemiology;
its tendency,

00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:43.582
that is, to arrive in a country
first by striking port cities,

00:31:43.582 --> 00:31:49.029
and only then moving inland by
road and river traffic.

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:52.219
Infected rats would clamor
aboard ships,

00:31:52.219 --> 00:31:56.635
by ropes and gangplanks,
or they could be lifted aboard

00:31:56.635 --> 00:32:00.480
in crates of grain or shipments
of clothes.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.920
Istanbul was a great hub of
trade in the Middle East,

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.162
and it linked the rest of the
Mediterranean world by trade

00:32:09.162 --> 00:32:13.501
overland across the Balkans,
and by ship to Venice,

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:17.470
Naples, Genoa,
Marseilles, Valencia.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.772
Sometimes there was havoc at
sea when a whole crew and its

00:32:21.772 --> 00:32:26.228
passengers would be killed by
the plague before they arrived

00:32:26.228 --> 00:32:30.249
at port,
and there were ghost ships that

00:32:30.249 --> 00:32:33.190
floated on the Mediterranean.
 

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.950
Once reaching a port,
however, the ship would dock

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.732
and rats would disembark,
in crates, or by rope,

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:47.402
or by the gangplank again,
and at the same time infected

00:32:47.402 --> 00:32:50.079
passengers and crew could go
ashore,

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:52.390
together with their fleas.
 

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.430
Normally the first indication
of plague--

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:59.741
one that's dramatically
apparent in Camus' novel The

00:32:59.741 --> 00:33:03.490
Plague,
but we'll also see in some of

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.118
the paintings that we'll look at
time after next--

00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:13.106
an important indication was a
sudden and massive die-off of

00:33:13.106 --> 00:33:13.710
rats.
 

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:19.369
And there would be pictures
like this of rats killed by an

00:33:19.369 --> 00:33:25.200
epidemic of bubonic plague;
in this case Sydney, Australia.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.795
So, ports are crucial in
epidemics, and in the

00:33:28.795 --> 00:33:33.269
development of public health
measures to counter them.

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:37.759
Almost invariably in Western
Europe the plague arrived in

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:42.087
port cities and then spread
inland, following roads and

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:42.970
rivers.
 

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.722
In the large cities,
the disease typically would

00:33:46.722 --> 00:33:51.449
arrive in the spring,
reach a peak of ferocity after

00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:54.869
a few weeks,
then continue as a violent

00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:59.056
outbreak for two to four months,
and then decline with the

00:33:59.056 --> 00:34:01.299
coming of colder,
dry weather,

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:06.682
either to disappear entirely,
or to be rekindled when

00:34:06.682 --> 00:34:10.829
favorable climatic conditions
returned.

00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:13.786
Well, that's the etiology,
in a nutshell,

00:34:13.786 --> 00:34:14.969
of the plague.
 

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:18.809
I'd like to turn now to its
symptomatology and pathology;

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:24.159
that is, how does it affect the
individual human body?

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.748
And the study of the symptoms
of the epidemics we study isn't

00:34:29.748 --> 00:34:33.289
just a matter of ghoulish
curiosity.

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:37.815
I'm going to argue that the
history of each epidemic disease

00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:38.889
is distinct.
 

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.411
That's one of the reasons that
I will be showing slides,

00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:46.000
to fix the image of a
particular disease in your mind.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.989
Because it's important not to
confuse them,

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.480
because each has its own
history.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.807
And a crucial variable is the
differing way in which each of

00:34:56.807 --> 00:35:00.239
these diseases affected its
victims.

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:03.480
A feature of the plague,
I would argue,

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.574
is that it seemed almost
purposefully designed to

00:35:07.574 --> 00:35:09.280
maximize terror.
 

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.467
I will be showing you some
vivid material,

00:35:12.467 --> 00:35:15.889
and I'm sorry that it's just
before lunch.

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:20.367
And indeed a couple of years
ago in this class someone in the

00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:23.800
front row fainted with some of
the pictures.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.572
So, if you don't wish to look
at them, I can tell you in

00:35:27.572 --> 00:35:29.630
advance it's not compulsory.
 

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.710
You can simply close your eyes.
 

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:35.934
In any case,
Yersinia pestis is

00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:41.253
exceptionally virulent because
of its ability to overwhelm the

00:35:41.253 --> 00:35:43.869
immune system of the body.
 

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:47.550
After an infective bite,
there's an incubation period,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:53.039
usually of one to six days,
and then the classic symptoms

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:56.612
appear--
the first beginning--launching

00:35:56.612 --> 00:35:59.639
the first stage of bubonic
plague.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:05.204
That is, at the site of the
flea bite, there's what's called

00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:10.956
a carbuncle or gangrenous black
blister, surrounded by red pot

00:36:10.956 --> 00:36:11.900
marks.
 

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.731
And this will be familiar to
you because it's been

00:36:15.731 --> 00:36:20.268
immortalized in the nursery
rhyme, "The Ring a Ring o'

00:36:20.268 --> 00:36:21.518
Roses."
 

00:36:21.518 --> 00:36:26.708
But also, along with it,
there's high temperature and

00:36:26.708 --> 00:36:31.496
shivering, violent headache,
nausea and vomiting,

00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:37.416
and general flu-like symptoms;
after which the patient passes

00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:41.039
on to the second stage of
bubonic plague,

00:36:41.039 --> 00:36:45.617
when it invades--the bacteria
invade the lymph system and

00:36:45.617 --> 00:36:47.989
drain into the lymph nodes.
 

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:52.608
A couple of days later a
so-called bubo--which gives the

00:36:52.608 --> 00:36:57.563
symptom that gives the disease
its name, bubonic plague--the

00:36:57.563 --> 00:37:00.000
plague of buboes appears.
 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.876
This is an infected swelling of
the lymph nodes,

00:37:03.876 --> 00:37:08.250
a hard mass the size of an
orange beneath the skin.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.489
The site of the bubo varies,
according to the location of

00:37:12.489 --> 00:37:14.079
the infective bite.
 

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:19.364
If a flea bites the legs,
the bubo is usually in the

00:37:19.364 --> 00:37:22.889
groin, and would look like that.
 

00:37:22.889 --> 00:37:27.309
If the fleas instead were to
bite the arms,

00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:30.929
the bubo would appear in the
armpit or on the neck,

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:36.300
and there would be
symptoms--would look like this,

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.980
or like that.
 

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.780
In any case,
Daniel Defoe imagined,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.295
and he writes in our book,
that the agony was so violent

00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:54.139
from the bubo that victims
hurled themselves from roofs,

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:56.909
or into the Thames to escape it.
 

00:37:56.909 --> 00:38:01.570
And there was a general
consensus that the body and all

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.887
of its excretions--urine,
sweat, the breath--had an

00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:07.960
overpowering stench.
 

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.525
This led--I want us to remember
how dehumanizing the symptoms of

00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:16.532
plague were,
and that's tremendously

00:38:16.532 --> 00:38:20.190
important to the way that
societies experienced its

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.070
outbreak.
 

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.110
In the third stage,
the bacteria releases a

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.367
powerful toxin,
and this circulates throughout

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:31.059
the bloodstream,
and it's the toxin that kills.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:34.523
It attacks tissues,
causing blood vessels to

00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:39.358
hemorrhage, and giving rise to
purpurous, subcutaneous spots,

00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:42.179
the so-called tokens of plague.
 

00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:44.260
Another bit of jargon to
remember.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.867
The plague is associated with
tokens and these--let's have a

00:38:49.867 --> 00:38:52.909
look at--which look like this.
 

00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:56.704
They gain their name because
they were thought by many to be

00:38:56.704 --> 00:38:59.423
the signs,
that is the tokens,

00:38:59.423 --> 00:39:03.889
of God's anger,
the anger that led him to smite

00:39:03.889 --> 00:39:06.400
his people with the plague.
 

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.719
The toxin initiates the septic
phase of this disease,

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:15.789
causing rapid degeneration of
the muscles of the heart,

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:18.762
of the kidneys,
of the nerves and the central

00:39:18.762 --> 00:39:22.556
nervous system,
and this leads to such symptoms

00:39:22.556 --> 00:39:26.224
as bloodshot eyes,
general prostration,

00:39:26.224 --> 00:39:29.380
fever, nausea,
severe headache,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:34.708
and progressive neurological
damage that's manifested by

00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:38.443
slurred speech,
a staggering gait,

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:42.440
psychic disturbances and
derangement.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:49.233
We again see how this disease
is terrifyingly dehumanizing and

00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:50.570
agonizing.
 

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:55.250
And it leads then to delirium
and coma.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:00.070
Sometimes it also causes
gangrene of the extremities--

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:04.849
and I will also have a picture
of that--

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:08.898
and this may,
in fact, be the origin of the

00:40:08.898 --> 00:40:10.730
term Black Death.
 

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.380
Now, in terms of the
symptomatology--let me pass on

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.239
from that to this.
 

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:21.690
This is a Franciscan friar,
Michael of Piazza,

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.347
a chronicler--you'll remember I
said Messina was the first place

00:40:26.347 --> 00:40:29.599
to be afflicted by bubonic
plague in 1347.

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:33.927
He wrote this terrifying
description of how it afflicted

00:40:33.927 --> 00:40:34.949
a sufferer.
 

00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:38.789
He wrote: "Not only did
the burned blisters appear,

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:42.211
but there developed in
different parts of the body

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:45.929
gland boils;
in some on the sexual organs.

00:40:45.929 --> 00:40:53.722
In others"--whoops,
sorry, there we go--"In

00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:58.670
others on the arms or the neck.
 

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.434
At first these were the size of
a hazelnut and developed

00:41:02.434 --> 00:41:06.608
accompanied by violent shivering
fits that soon rendered those

00:41:06.608 --> 00:41:10.510
attacked so weak they could no
longer stand upright,

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.199
but were forced to lie in their
beds,

00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:18.440
consumed by violent fever and
overcome by great tribulation.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.360
Soon the boils grew to the size
of a walnut,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.945
then a hen's egg,
and they were exceedingly

00:41:23.945 --> 00:41:28.867
painful and irritated the body,
causing it to vomit blood by

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:31.090
vitiating the juices.
 

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:34.711
The blood rose from the
affected lungs to the throat,

00:41:34.711 --> 00:41:38.543
producing on the whole body a
putrefying and decomposing

00:41:38.543 --> 00:41:39.309
effect.
 

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:42.985
The sickness lasted three days,
and on the fourth,

00:41:42.985 --> 00:41:46.360
at the latest,
the patient succumbed."

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.481
So, as soon as anyone was
seized with headache and

00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:52.125
shivering,
he knew that he was bound to

00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:54.590
pass away within the specified
time,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.800
and first confessed his sins to
the priest,

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.079
and then made his will.
 

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:06.050
Death occurred in about half of
cases within a few days,

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:10.603
though some of the afflicted
lingered in agony for as long as

00:42:10.603 --> 00:42:15.076
three to four weeks,
and then a minority slowly

00:42:15.076 --> 00:42:16.230
recovered.
 

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.349
The symptoms of bubonic plague
are agonizing.

00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:23.702
They're terrifying,
dehumanizing,

00:42:23.702 --> 00:42:29.150
as suffers succumb to
hallucinations and delirium.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.239
Now, there are three forms of
bubonic plague,

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:35.820
and I want to mention what
those are immediately.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.289
These are not three separate
diseases.

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:42.789
They're one disease in three
separate manifestations.

00:42:42.789 --> 00:42:46.978
The first is what we've been
describing as classic bubonic

00:42:46.978 --> 00:42:50.947
plague, the most common and
historically most important

00:42:50.947 --> 00:42:51.610
form.
 

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:56.717
Then there's septicemic plague,
which is an overwhelming

00:42:56.717 --> 00:43:00.990
infection in which the patient
frequently dies,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.150
even before developing a bubo.
 

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.480
But this, as I said,
is not a separate disease;

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.940
simply a fulminant form of
plague;

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:14.780
and it's most common among the
elderly.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.530
Then there's pneumonic plague,
which again is the same

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:24.639
disease, but clinically and
epidemiologically distinct.

00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:29.101
It begins with an ordinary case
of plague, complicated by

00:43:29.101 --> 00:43:33.880
pneumonia, and can then give
rise to a secondary catastrophe,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:39.047
within the general disaster;
that is, the disease is then

00:43:39.047 --> 00:43:44.751
spread by bacteria coughed out
in the sputum of the victim and

00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:49.987
spread person to person when
inhaled by those near him or

00:43:49.987 --> 00:43:50.829
her.
 

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:55.340
This form of plague is not
dependent on fleas.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.362
It's highly infectious,
and as far as is known is one

00:44:00.362 --> 00:44:02.679
hundred percent fatal.
 

00:44:02.679 --> 00:44:05.619
And even today,
in the antibiotic era,

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:08.719
there's no cure for pneumonic
plague.

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:14.818
And pneumonic plague is also
recorded in your favorite

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.659
nursery rhyme.
 

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:19.710
This is the,
"ah-choo,

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:23.699
ah-choo, we all fall
down."

00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:25.969
Now, what did doctors do?
 

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:29.809
What were treatments
historically?

00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:33.518
There was a continuity of
strategy from the Black Death,

00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:38.135
through the eighteenth century,
based on Galenic principles of

00:44:38.135 --> 00:44:41.920
dealing with the a
disequilibrium of the humors.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.900
So, the main indication of
treatment was to assist the body

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.880
in expelling what was called the
peccant humor responsible,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.199
or the morbific poison.
 

00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:58.561
The physician regarded his task
as one of assisting Nature,

00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:03.449
as the body was already clearly
attempting to expel the poison.

00:45:03.449 --> 00:45:06.920
After all, it was vomiting,
there was diarrhea and

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.699
sweating.
 

00:45:07.699 --> 00:45:12.449
So, physicians attempted to
assist the body in its fight;

00:45:12.449 --> 00:45:17.099
perhaps directly by bleeding,
a very popular therapy,

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:20.440
although there were intense
debates about timing,

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:25.449
about the best veins to be
opened, and the amount of blood

00:45:25.449 --> 00:45:26.679
to be drawn.
 

00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:30.414
Other key practices were
administering powerful

00:45:30.414 --> 00:45:34.637
purgatives or emetics,
so the poison could pour forth

00:45:34.637 --> 00:45:38.009
more copiously;
or to cause the patient to

00:45:38.009 --> 00:45:40.965
sweat, piling him or her high
with clothes,

00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:44.061
even mattresses,
so the poison would pass out

00:45:44.061 --> 00:45:47.780
through the pores;
and forbidding the sufferer to

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.230
drink;
and of course lancing or

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.967
cauterizing the bubo itself,
so that it too could discharge

00:45:54.967 --> 00:45:57.500
its load of poison directly.
 

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.159
Some doctors applied hot
compresses.

00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:03.411
There were also internal
medicines that were

00:46:03.411 --> 00:46:05.983
administered,
as they were thought to raise

00:46:05.983 --> 00:46:08.681
the buboes,
or to hasten recovery by

00:46:08.681 --> 00:46:13.407
fortifying what was called the
flagging animal energy of the

00:46:13.407 --> 00:46:18.110
victim;
things like brandy or opium.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:22.358
But in practice,
treatment was pitifully rare

00:46:22.358 --> 00:46:24.579
for plague sufferers.
 

00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:29.271
Physicians, priests and
attendants recognized that they

00:46:29.271 --> 00:46:32.358
were powerless;
that they were too few in

00:46:32.358 --> 00:46:35.960
number to cope with the
catastrophe that engulfed them.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.710
And they perished too in great
numbers during the outbreaks.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:45.197
And many, overcome with terror
like everyone else,

00:46:45.197 --> 00:46:46.480
simply fled.
 

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.717
So, one of the terrors of the
plague was that it broke the

00:46:50.717 --> 00:46:55.150
common bonds of humanity,
and the common plight of plague

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.880
victims was often to be
abandoned,

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.090
to face agony and death alone.
 

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:10.547
Let's listen to the famous and
awful testimony of Boccaccio in

00:47:10.547 --> 00:47:17.369
The Decameron,
describing Florence.

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:22.777
Sorry for a momentary
technological glitch,

00:47:22.777 --> 00:47:25.610
but we'll get there.
 

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.139
There we are.
 

00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:32.889
This is Boccaccio describing
Florence in 1348.

00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:36.610
"Let us omit that one
Citizen fled after another,

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.619
and one neighbor had not any
care of another,

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:42.360
Parents nor kindred ever
visiting them,

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.708
but utterly they were forsaken
on all sides:

00:47:45.708 --> 00:47:49.679
this tribulation pierced into
the hearts of men,

00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:53.431
and with such a dreadful
terror, that one brother forsook

00:47:53.431 --> 00:47:55.989
another,
the Uncle, the Nephew,

00:47:55.989 --> 00:48:00.143
the Sister, the Brother,
and the Wife the Husband:

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:04.210
nay a matter much greater,
and almost incredible;

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:08.855
Fathers and Mothers fled from
their own Children,

00:48:08.855 --> 00:48:13.210
even as if they no way
appertained to them.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.018
In regard whereof,
it could not be otherwise,

00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:19.849
but that a countless multitude
of men and women fell sick;

00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:24.518
finding no charity among their
friends, except a very few,

00:48:24.518 --> 00:48:28.780
and were subject to the avarice
of servants."

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.500
So, this is our first overview
of plague in its three

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.590
pandemics.
 

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.246
Next time what I'd like to do
is to talk about the response of

00:48:39.246 --> 00:48:43.920
communities to this catastrophe,
and to look in particular at

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.920
public health measures designed
to protect communities.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.039
That's where we're heading next.
 

00:48:50.039 --> 00:48:55.000

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.946
Prof: Okay,
as you may remember,

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:08.518
way back before the exam,
we'd started looking at how

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:11.082
things really happened,
how people were able to figure

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.553
out about bonds,
and how atoms were arranged,

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:17.081
and molecules reacted,
before there were the powerful

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.514
techniques that we --
that developed mostly in the

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:22.870
last twenty-five or thirty
years,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.825
as far as their practical
application in organic

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.588
chemistry;
but how they found these out

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:29.880
before that time.
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.658
And it started with what we
call the "Chemical

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:35.428
Revolution",
which was launched by

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:39.652
Lavoisier, with this book,
in 1789, the same year as the

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:42.865
French Revolution,
The Elementary Treatise of

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:43.810
Chemistry.
 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.896
Which, you remember,
he started work on just because

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:49.740
he was interested in improving
nomenclature,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.320
but found that there was such a
tight coupling between

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.081
nomenclature and the science --
that is, the facts and the

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:59.038
theory --
that he couldn't improve any

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.090
one of them without improving
the others.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.239
So we saw last time that he
developed a --

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.599
that in the process of
developing a new nomenclature,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:14.319
he also developed instruments,
so that he could weigh gases,

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.706
because weighing turns out to
be such an important feature in

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:19.909
all of nineteenth century
chemistry,

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.870
no doubt the most important
single technique.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.599
But he also could measure heat,
which didn't have any weight.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.078
For that he developed a
calorimeter together with

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.920
Laplace, and we saw how that
worked by melting ice.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.290
So now we're going to look at
some of the other developments

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.253
from this book,
in particular the idea of

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:42.290
oxidation.
 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.845
There's no doubt that the most
important element for Lavoisier

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:51.120
was oxygen,
because of its key role in his

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.575
chemistry,
so that all other elements were

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:58.120
called bases,
or radicals. Right?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.819
And they could react with
oxygen to become new things.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.221
There were several degrees of
oxidation, as shown in this

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:07.200
table from the English
translation of his book.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.465
So first you get an oxide,
oxides of all the elements that

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.860
are listed in the first table.
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.848
For example,
hydrogen when oxidized would

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:19.460
give water;
that's the second row.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.669
But the first row is caloric.
 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.389
This was sort of a stretch,
at least it seems so from our

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.978
perspective, that caloric,
heat, when it gets oxidized,

00:02:28.978 --> 00:02:30.438
yields oxygen gas.
 

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:34.406
But then there were further
degrees of oxidation if you

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.389
reacted with more oxygen.
 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.275
So the second degree of
oxidation, according to his

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:44.393
theory, was to give an acid,
that the suffix was to be

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.580
systematically o-u-s,
so -ous.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.053
And those names we use now,
like cuprous,

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:53.330
ferrous, come directly from
this work of Lavoisier.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.947
So that's the lower oxidation
state of an acid.

00:02:57.947 --> 00:02:58.750
Right?
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.296
So you have,
for example,

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.103
nitrous acid,
carbonous acid,

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:04.167
sulfurous acid,
phosphorous acid,

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.068
he said.
 

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:08.025
And then you have a still
higher degree of oxidation,

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:10.810
the third degree,
which is the -ic acid.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.813
So you have nitric acid,
carbonic acid,

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:15.080
sulfuric acid.
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.038
And notice that many of these
were not known;

00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:21.778
and many of them still are not
known because the theory wasn't

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:22.758
exactly right.
 

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:26.152
For example,
carbonous acid was not known at

00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:29.131
that time;
you see in the second entry in

00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:31.229
the second row,
second column.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.090
Okay?
 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.032
And then there was still a
fourth degree of oxidation,

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:38.699
which he called the
oxygenated ic acid.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.990
He didn't use the peroxy acid,
as we would often use nowadays.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.592
But he used,
for example,

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:47.530
oxygenated nitric acid,
which was unknown.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.000
Oxygenated carbonic acid was
unknown.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.550
Same for sulfuric or phosphoric.
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.869
And oxygenated muriatic acid
was -- used to be called

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.038
dephlogisticated marine acid.
 

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:03.806
But he has a more systematic
name, showing its degree of

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:04.408
oxidation.
 

00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:07.824
So these -ous and
-ic names,

00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:11.990
that we still use,
come directly from Lavoisier.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.658
And probably the next most
important tool he developed was

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:21.139
one for doing elemental
analysis.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.632
Remember, you could do
proximate analysis,

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:26.978
what other compounds are
present in the substance you're

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:27.769
studying.
 

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:31.290
Or you could do ultimate
analysis and find out how much

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.639
of the elements there was in
each.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.067
And this was how to do
elemental analysis of an organic

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:38.560
oil.
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.550
So it has carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen in it.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.990
Okay?
 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.410
So this big upside-down barrel,
inside another barrel with

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.036
water in it,
is how he got air for the

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:53.459
burning, because the upside-down
barrel would be lowered into the

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.692
water,
which would create pressure in

00:04:55.692 --> 00:04:57.440
the oxygen that's trapped
inside.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.487
It would then flow out through
the pipe you see coming from the

00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:04.685
tank,
through a dryer and into this

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:10.040
big, vertical cylinder where the
combustion takes place,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.459
fed by an oil supply which is
siphoned in as needed.

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:20.613
So there's a lamp inside,
burning the oil with the air,

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:25.307
and the vapors generated by the
combustion come up and out the

00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:27.000
tube to the right.
 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.620
So there's the lamp.
 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.149
The gases come out and water
gets condensed in the spiral

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.483
tube, in here,
and drips down and gets

00:05:34.483 --> 00:05:36.879
collected in the jar that you
see.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.620
And the part that doesn't
condense and get collected into

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.612
the jar,
gets absorbed in that

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:45.624
horizontal tube that has a
calcium chloride drying agent in

00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:46.040
it.
 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.757
So at the end of the experiment
you weigh how much water there

00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:53.415
is in the jar and how much the
calcium chloride has increased

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:55.685
in weight,
and that tells you how much

00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:56.540
water there was.
 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.160
And what does that tell you
about the compound?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.720
How much what?
 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.341
What element is being measured
in the oil, by weighing the

00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:07.850
water?
 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.360
It's measuring the hydrogen.
 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.134
So he had to know what percent,
by weight, water is,

00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:14.170
of hydrogen.
 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.028
Then if he measured the water
that came from combustion,

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:20.197
he measured how much hydrogen
there was in the oil sample that

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:21.290
was being burned.
 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.699
And then the gases continued to
go through limewater,

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.778
calcium hydroxide.
 

00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:34.639
So that would absorb CO_2,
as calcium carbonate.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.029
So those would increase in mass.
 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.483
And he had two of them,
so whatever got through the

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:42.279
first one would hopefully be
collected in the next one.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.589
And then there's another drying
tube, on further from that,

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.442
because these solutions,
as you pass gas over them,

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:50.555
they lose a little bit of their
water.

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:51.240
Right?
 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.476
So they'd be losing weight,
as well as gaining weight from

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:56.238
the CO_2 that's being absorbed.
 

00:06:56.238 --> 00:06:56.750
Right?
 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.100
But that water that's lost is
reabsorbed in that final tube.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.079
So you weigh it at the end,
and now you have --

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.461
you've corrected for whatever
loss of water there was from the

00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:09.213
bulbs,
and now you know what weight of

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:09.649
CO_2.
 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.937
And if know what fraction of
CO_2 is carbon -- and there's a

00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:15.778
homework problem for Friday that
you can look at.

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:20.346
You can work in groups on that,
that shows you how he knew how

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:24.240
much -- what weight percentage
of CO_2 was carbon.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.850
So having then measured how
much CO_2, he knew how much

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.300
carbon there was in the oil.
 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.490
So he measured the hydrogen,
he measured the carbon.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.269
So that's fine if it's a
hydrocarbon oil.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:36.610
How about if there was oxygen
in the oil?

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.920
Notice, he's adding all kinds
of oxygen from the air.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.678
So how's he going to know how
much oxygen there was,

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:45.709
if it was an alcohol or
something that he was burning?

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:46.720
Student: 
&gt;

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.382
Prof: Sam?
 

00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:49.949
Can't hear you.
 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.069
Student:  The leftovers.
 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.060
Prof: It's the leftovers.
 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.839
You see how much oil got
burned, how much carbon,

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:57.620
how much hydrogen,
and you assume there's nothing

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.360
else there, except oxygen.
 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.649
So you get oxygen by difference.
 

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.802
And that's the way oxygen is
almost always measured,

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:05.853
is by difference.
 

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:06.410
Right?
 

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.805
So you assume -- and you have
to be sure there are no other

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:10.581
elements there,
if you want that to be true,

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:11.160
obviously.
 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.607
Okay, so this was a big
operation and it took,

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:16.814
you know, somebody to control
the air supply to make sure it

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:17.740
was constant.
 

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.970
Notice, incidentally,
there's a T here.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.574
So there was another one of
these things over here,

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:25.398
another one of these double
barrels.

00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:25.920
Right?
 

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.930
Why?
 

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.839
Student: 
&gt;

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.764
Prof: Ah,
so when you run out of air in

00:08:30.764 --> 00:08:34.600
one, you switch the valve and
take it from the other one;

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.879
then you can go back to the
first one.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.336
So you have an infinite supply
of air, plenty to burn the oil.

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:39.788
Right?
 

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:41.440
But you need someone to control
that,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.269
and you need someone else to
make sure the lamp stays lit,

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.190
that it gets the proper amount
of oil siphoned in,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.740
and the airflow is right.
 

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.663
You need someone else -- in the
CO_2 collectors,

00:08:51.663 --> 00:08:53.778
you just blow gas over the
surface.

00:08:53.778 --> 00:08:54.399
Right?
 

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.279
So it's got a little key on the
top and a hook that goes down

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:57.519
in.
 

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.861
Somebody has to be standing
there, doing this,

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:00.850
to keep it stirred.
 

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:01.320
Right?
 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.000
So that's stirred.
 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.424
So it takes at least three or
four people to run this thing.

00:09:05.424 --> 00:09:05.889
Right?
 

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:08.120
And it cost a lot of money to
build.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.278
So no one else built one.
 

00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:13.248
In fact, it's not absolutely
certain that Lavoisier ever used

00:09:13.248 --> 00:09:15.629
this, although it exists --
right?

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:17.841
-- because he was busy with
other things,

00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.940
having to do with the French
Revolution, by the time this

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:21.769
came along.
 

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.278
But this was big science. Right?
 

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:26.673
He was very wealthy,
so he was able to do this kind

00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:27.418
of thing.
 

00:09:27.418 --> 00:09:28.884
But he showed,
in this diagram,

00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:30.399
exactly how it could be done.
 

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.558
So it was no secret,
not like what the alchemists

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:35.080
did.
 

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.950
Was there a question here?
 

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.460
No.
 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.408
Yes Lucas?
 

00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:40.535
Student:  Did they ever
measure like the air supply they

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:40.879
gave it?
 

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:41.580
Prof: Did they measure
--

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.727
Student:  Did they
measure the amount of air that

00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:44.509
they gave into it?
 

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:45.610
Did they know like the amount
of the air?

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.144
Prof: I don't think so,
because there wasn't any

00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:49.306
purpose;
you didn't care how much air

00:09:49.306 --> 00:09:50.110
you put in.
 

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.808
Because most of the air just
flowed right on through,

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:54.001
it was never collected.
 

00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:54.470
Right?
 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.249
It just carried the other gases
along, where the water and the

00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.860
CO_2 would be collected.
 

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.241
Student:  Well I guess
if they knew the content of the

00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:06.230
air, like they could just
measure how much oxygen-

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.539
Prof: To get the oxygen?
 

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:09.269
Conceivably;
but that was never done.

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.649
It would've been very difficult
to collect all that air and

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:14.048
measure it accurately.
 

00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:17.077
Okay now what if you have a
substance that won't burn

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:19.639
cleanly, so you can't measure
these gases?

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.414
Notice, incidentally,
the role of gases in

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:25.529
understanding things,
because they provide easy

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:26.274
separation.
 

00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:27.019
Right?
 

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:31.144
And then since he was able to
weigh gas, once,

00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:34.080
then he knows the gas density.
 

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.052
So now all you have to do,
from then on,

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.176
in principle,
is measure the volume of gas,

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:40.298
and you know how much stuff
there was.

00:10:40.298 --> 00:10:42.960
So gases played a really key
role through all this.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.985
But suppose you had a substance
that wouldn't burn,

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:48.769
that you couldn't convert to
steam and CO_2.

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:49.889
What do you do then?
 

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:52.250
For example, grape sugar.
 

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.899
So here's chapter thirteen
where he talks about le suc

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:58.178
des raisins,
the grape sugar;

00:10:58.178 --> 00:11:01.139
which will char,
it won't burn cleanly.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:02.058
So what do you do?
 

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.567
Well, as he says up at the top
there, "tout le monde

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:06.269
sait comment se fait le
vin";

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:10.662
everyone knows how to make
wine, cider and mead.

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:11.408
Right?
 

00:11:11.408 --> 00:11:15.730
So can you see what he's going
to do?

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.649
So here's the device for that
one, which is in many ways sort

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:21.619
of similar, but you don't need
an air -- you don't put the air

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:21.960
in.
 

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.988
What you have is a big flask at
the beginning which has sugar,

00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:27.044
yeast and water.
 

00:11:27.044 --> 00:11:27.639
Right?
 

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:35.759
So the yeast ferments the sugar
and changes it into CO_2.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:38.602
So you have -- it foams up;
if you've even seen something

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:39.110
fermenting.
 

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.375
So you have to have something
that catches the foam so it

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.548
won't get into your device.
 

00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:46.120
And then you have something
that will absorb water.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.740
Now the water is not just --
it's not like the previous one,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.908
where the water is all formed
by the thing,

00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:53.190
because you got a whole bunch
of water there at the beginning.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.490
Right?
 

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.940
So that's not what you're
trying to measure.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.265
What you're trying to measure
is how much carbon,

00:11:57.265 --> 00:11:59.399
how much CO_2 there is in the
grape sugar.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.561
So you have these sodium
hydroxide solutions,

00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:06.370
the base that will absorb the
CO_2, as a carbonate.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.288
So you weigh those before and
after.

00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.798
And the excess gas,
if there's another gas being

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:16.428
evolved, will collect over the
mercury in the far tube here.

00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:20.677
So he could measure the CO --
the carbon, in sugar,

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:25.690
by converting it completely to
CO_2 through fermentation.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:31.793
In speaking of fermentation
here, he says it furnishes a

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.789
means of analyzing sugar.
 

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:36.889
So oxidation failed with air.
 

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.875
Even with oxygen or sulfuric
acid or mercuric oxide,

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.509
you couldn't get clean
combustion of sugar;

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:44.408
you got charring instead.
 

00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:48.230
But as he says here -- this is
the most interesting thing about

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.897
his treatment of the data --
he said, "I could consider

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:54.360
the materials subjected to
fermentation,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.212
and the products of
fermentation,

00:12:57.212 --> 00:13:01.808
as an algebraic equation,
having to do with weights."

00:13:01.808 --> 00:13:05.519
Can you see what his
assumption's going to be here?

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.690
Student:
&gt;

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.308
Prof: Sam?
 

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:09.460
Student:  The same
weights on both --

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.940
Prof: The same weights
on both side;

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.220
conservation of mass is his
assumption.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220
Okay?
 

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.041
So he can make an equation that
the weight on the right and the

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:19.769
weight on the left will be the
same.

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:21.090
Okay, so an algebraic equation.
 

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.702
"And by in turn,
supposing each of the elements

00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:28.664
of the equation to be unknown,
I can derive a value,

00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:32.149
and thus correct experiment by
calculation,

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:34.840
and calculation by
experiment."

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.918
So what does he mean by that?
 

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:41.779
So if you have this equation,
a certain amount of sugar and a

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:45.320
certain amount of oxygen gives a
certain amount of CO_2,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.091
for example.
 

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:46.798
Right?
 

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:49.320
So the weights on the two sides
should be the same.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.816
He doesn't know one of them.
 

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:52.440
Right?
 

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.133
But if he knows all the others,
and it's an algebraic equation,

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:58.100
he can then solve for that one.
 

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.374
So he says here:
"I can derive a value and

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:04.720
thus correct experiment by
calculation."

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.240
Have you ever heard of that
being done?

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.908
Lexie?
 

00:14:09.908 --> 00:14:11.178
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:11.178 --> 00:14:14.306
Prof: Would somebody --
would you do that in lab,

00:14:14.306 --> 00:14:15.500
correct experiment?
 

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.339
Do you suppose there might be
any nefarious people who would

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:23.048
correct their experiments by
calculation after finishing a

00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:23.570
lab?
 

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.230
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.437
Prof: No,
I can't imagine that would

00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:28.278
happen, right?
 

00:14:28.278 --> 00:14:30.607
Okay, but Lavoisier was
upfront.

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:31.210
Right?
 

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.715
He was even,
one might say,

00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:35.264
bragging about it,
that he has this algebraic

00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:37.754
equation, so he can correct his
experiments.

00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:38.450
Right?
 

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.798
"I've often profited from
this way of correcting the

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.548
preliminary results of my
experiments."

00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:48.754
No one told him that that's not
the way science works.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:49.389
Right?
 

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.340
That the experiments are the
things you have to do.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.149
You have to adjust the theory
to deal with the experiments.

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:56.808
Okay?
 

00:14:56.808 --> 00:15:02.515
Remember, he was the treasurer
for the firm that collected

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:05.219
taxes for the French Crown.
 

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:06.120
Right?
 

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.514
So he was accustomed to
bookkeeping, and everything had

00:15:09.514 --> 00:15:12.030
to balance, right down to the
sou.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.658
Right?
 

00:15:12.658 --> 00:15:15.190
So the same thing he applied to
chemistry.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.740
So Table One here is the
materials of fermentation.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.649
He put in a certain amount of
water, 400 pounds;

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:25.908
a certain amount of sugar,
100 pounds; yeast.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:28.278
Now he knew that the yeast was
wet.

00:15:28.278 --> 00:15:30.090
So there was a certain amount
of water.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.525
He put ten pounds of yeast,
but he knew by analysis,

00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:35.750
by proximate analysis -- right?
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.515
-- not what the elements are
but what the substances are

00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:42.245
there --
that in ten pounds of yeast,

00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:45.057
wet yeast,
you'd have seven pounds,

00:15:45.057 --> 00:15:48.668
three ounces,
six gros and forty-four grains.

00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:54.363
It turns that a gros is a 72nd
of a grain, and eight gros make

00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:55.389
an ounce.
 

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.639
So it's a gros is -- which is
28.35 grams.

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:01.379
So, if you want,
you can work through all this.

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:06.902
Do you think he had analyzed
things that accurately,

00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:12.966
that he knew right down to the
gros how much there was in

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:14.048
there?
 

00:16:14.048 --> 00:16:14.215
No.
 

00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:16.360
There's no way he could've
known that.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.620
But things had to balance,
right?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.682
So he made an approximate
thing, and then he carried it

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:24.631
out to eighteen decimal points,
the way you'd do on a

00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:25.255
calculator.
 

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:25.879
Right?
 

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:29.960
Okay, so he didn't know about
significant figures yet either.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.629
Okay?
 

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:35.370
So then in Table Two he figures
in that much water,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.720
sugar, yeast,
how much is there of --

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.129
in each one,
how much is in water,

00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:42.289
how much is hydrogen,
and how much is oxygen.

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:42.980
So he knows that.
 

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.702
So now he knows down to
hundredths of gros how much of

00:16:46.702 --> 00:16:51.126
each of those elements there are
in the 400 pounds of water he's

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:51.830
using.
 

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.980
Incidentally,
he never used 400 pounds of

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.610
water.
 

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.504
He just rounded his numbers up,
or multiplied his numbers,

00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:00.129
scaled them up to be that big.
 

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:03.259
He used large quantities,
but not that large.

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:04.098
Okay.
 

00:17:04.098 --> 00:17:06.770
So if you had 100 pounds of
sugar, you'd have a certain

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.194
amount of hydrogen,
oxygen and charcoal - that is,

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:09.740
carbon.
 

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.022
And if you had a certain amount
of the dry yeast you'd have

00:17:13.022 --> 00:17:13.420
that.
 

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.682
And then he makes still a third
table where he rearranges it,

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:18.858
so he pulls the elements all
together.

00:17:18.858 --> 00:17:21.153
So in the starting material,
how much hydrogen,

00:17:21.153 --> 00:17:22.150
oxygen and carbon?
 

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.400
Okay?
 

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.034
So he's got 411 pounds,
12 ounces, 6 gros,

00:17:28.034 --> 00:17:33.798
1.36 grains of oxygen -- grains
and gros, got it;

00:17:33.798 --> 00:17:36.730
oh gros and grains,
okay, right -- okay,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.308
that much oxygen and some
amount of hydrogen and charcoal,

00:17:40.308 --> 00:17:42.880
and a certain amount of
nitrogen that's in the yeast,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.750
because he knew that was there;
which is just a small weight

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.608
altogether, because there's not
much yeast.

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:52.726
And in all, 510 pounds exactly.
 

00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:53.430
Right?
 

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.759
So his balance sheet was just
like what a banker would want.

00:17:57.759 --> 00:18:00.784
Okay, and now he does -- he
looks at the products,

00:18:00.784 --> 00:18:04.240
and he has a certain amount of
CO_2 that he collected;

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.440
that's carbonic acid.
 

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.380
And he knows how much oxygen
and charcoal;

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.390
there is that.
 

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.098
A certain amount of water.
 

00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:13.808
A certain amount of alcohol,
if dry.

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:16.545
So he had to collect the
alcohol and say how much alcohol

00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:18.059
and how much water was in it.
 

00:18:18.059 --> 00:18:19.460
How much acetic acid.
 

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.630
How much residual sugar that
had fermented.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.750
And how much dry yeast there
was at the end.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.056
And he added them all together,
and by God, there was 510

00:18:30.056 --> 00:18:33.670
pounds, zero ounces,
zero gros, and zero grains.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.440
Right?
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.619
QED.
 

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:38.450
Okay?
 

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.210
And then he recapitulated it,
according to how much oxygen,

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.210
how much charcoal and how much
hydrogen.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:48.440
And once again it balances out
absolutely precisely.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.009
Okay, so he recapitulates it
that way.

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:55.019
And this is how he would do
some of these things.

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:55.750
Okay?
 

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.630
So this is a description of an
experiment,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.778
on page eighty-eight to
ninety-two of the

00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:02.410
Traité
Élémentaire.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.413
Okay, so he's got a fire
burning here,

00:19:04.413 --> 00:19:07.173
and a glass tube that runs
through the middle of the

00:19:07.173 --> 00:19:08.473
charcoal that's burning.
 

00:19:08.473 --> 00:19:09.068
Right?
 

00:19:09.068 --> 00:19:13.182
And he's got a flask cemented
to it, on the right,

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:15.278
which is over a burner.
 

00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:18.751
And in the tube he puts
twenty-eight grains of carbon --

00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:21.720
not pieces but a weight of
twenty-two grains.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.818
We saw what a grain was last
time.

00:19:23.818 --> 00:19:28.978
That turns out to be 1.38 grams
of carbon he's got inside the

00:19:28.978 --> 00:19:29.578
tube.
 

00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:33.671
Okay, and now do you think the
carbon will evaporate,

00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:36.740
incidentally,
if you put it in flame?

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.410
Do you know how?
 

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.619
How do you know it won't
evaporate?

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:40.118
Student:  It shouldn't.
 

00:19:40.118 --> 00:19:41.089
Prof: Where do you get
carbon?

00:19:41.089 --> 00:19:42.609
What did he call it?
 

00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:44.088
Student:  Charcoal.
 

00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:45.180
Prof: He called it
charcoal.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.400
You get charcoal by the flame,
right?;

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.410
so with burning without enough
oxygen.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.019
So obviously it's not going to
evaporate, it's just going to

00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:53.548
sit there.
 

00:19:53.548 --> 00:19:56.390
Okay, so in flask A there he
puts water.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.858
So there's water in it.
 

00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:01.595
And then he lights the fire
underneath and the water begins

00:20:01.595 --> 00:20:05.460
to boil, and distills through
the tube and collects over here

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.619
in H. Right?
 

00:20:06.619 --> 00:20:09.150
There it comes.
 

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.960
Okay?
 

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:16.460
But did you notice what
happened in the process?

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:25.359
Want me to back up and do it
again?

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:26.650
What happened?
 

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.940
Student:  The charcoal
went away.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.579
Prof: The charcoal went
away.

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:34.880
What happened?
 

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.990
Well let's see what he found.
 

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.512
So, the twenty-eight grains of
carbon was gone.

00:20:41.512 --> 00:20:42.298
Right?
 

00:20:42.298 --> 00:20:46.346
And in the end he got the water
that he had put in at the start,

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:47.890
but not all the water.
 

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.450
It was 85.7 grains short.
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:59.740
So all the carbon and some of
the water has gone.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:12.130
Where did it go?
 

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:18.470
Well it went out the tube.
 

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.950
So out the tube,
he said, came 144 cubic inches

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.511
--
and because he knows the

00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:26.710
density, he knows how much
weight that is --

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.105
100 grains, exactly,
of carbonic gas,

00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:34.492
CO_2;
we would call it CO_2 -- and

00:21:34.492 --> 00:21:37.660
380 cubic inches of flammable
gas.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.096
So one of them would be
collected by limewater,

00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:42.375
the carbonic gas,
and the other one would go

00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.490
right on through.
 

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.829
What do you suppose flammable
gas is?

00:21:45.829 --> 00:21:46.630
Students:  Hydrogen.
 

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.318
Prof: Hydrogen.
 

00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:51.310
So the oxygen went to the
carbon, and the hydrogen became

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.019
elemental hydrogen,
in this process.

00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:55.150
Okay?
 

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.880
Now, look at this,
this is what's neat.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.230
So he got 100 grams -- 100
grains, pardon me,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:05.390
of carbonic gas,
and 13.7 grains of hydro-gen,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.299
the stuff that gives water when
you burn it,

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:08.778
according to him. Right?
 

00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:10.450
Which is right,
which is correct.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:16.400
And what do you notice,
quantitatively?

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.538
Student:  They match.
 

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:23.852
Prof: They exactly
match, right down to the 10ths

00:22:23.852 --> 00:22:25.230
of grains.
 

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.108
Okay?
 

00:22:27.108 --> 00:22:30.240
Now, if you recalculate,
by modern theory,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.919
how much gas you should get
from twenty-eight grains of

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.082
carbon doing this,
you should get 157 cubic inches

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:42.509
and 313 cubic inches,
instead of 144 and 380;

00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:47.259
you should get 103 grains of
carbonic gas and 9.4 grains of

00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:48.568
flammable gas.
 

00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:50.909
So his experiments weren't
perfect.

00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:51.460
Right?
 

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.358
Which is not surprising,
and there's no shame in that.

00:22:56.358 --> 00:22:59.750
But what would we now say he
did wrong?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.328
Student:  He adjusted
his results.

00:23:01.328 --> 00:23:04.896
Prof: He adjusted his
results to fit his theory.

00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:05.359
Okay?
 

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.538
But this was early days.
 

00:23:07.538 --> 00:23:10.798
He thought, he actually said,
on page ninety-two:

00:23:10.798 --> 00:23:14.874
"I have thought it best to
correct by calculation and to

00:23:14.874 --> 00:23:18.608
present the experiment in all
its simplicity."

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:23.297
Now what's wrong with
presenting an experiment in all

00:23:23.297 --> 00:23:24.828
its simplicity?
 

00:23:24.828 --> 00:23:28.709
You lose anything that's new,
anything that you might have

00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:30.819
discovered in the experiment.
 

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:31.660
Okay?
 

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.157
But he was discovering a lot of
stuff, so we'll forgive him

00:23:34.157 --> 00:23:34.460
that.
 

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.108
Okay?
 

00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:37.579
He was certainly a great
scientist.

00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:40.390
So what were his contributions?
 

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.740
Clarity, above all. Right?
 

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.307
This idea of facts and ideas
and words having to go together

00:23:48.307 --> 00:23:50.088
and improve together.
 

00:23:50.088 --> 00:23:53.511
And of the facts he worked on,
there were these -- the

00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:56.160
apparatus I showed,
and others as well.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.450
The important thing was
quantitation,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.278
using numbers,
which people hadn't used before

00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:03.330
--
not nearly as effectively at

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.106
least --
concentrating on making things

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:08.859
balance,
using mass as the criterion for

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:10.490
how much stuff you have.
 

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:15.048
But also, in the case of gases,
volume, but measuring the

00:24:15.048 --> 00:24:18.795
density, so that you can relate
volume to mass,

00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:21.890
which is the fundamental
quantity.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.299
He found some new substances --
although that wasn't much of a

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:27.518
contribution on his part;
other people,

00:24:27.518 --> 00:24:30.516
like Scheele before him,
had discovered lots and lots of

00:24:30.516 --> 00:24:34.214
new pure substances;
that wasn't Lavoisier's strong

00:24:34.214 --> 00:24:36.088
suit -- and reactions.
 

00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:40.488
And then, with respect to
ideas, the idea of what an

00:24:40.488 --> 00:24:43.162
element is;
that it's not some platonic

00:24:43.162 --> 00:24:46.724
ideal, but it only means as far
as we've so far been able to go

00:24:46.724 --> 00:24:49.368
in analyzing things and breaking
them down.

00:24:49.368 --> 00:24:52.394
And if we can't break them down
further, we'll assume for the

00:24:52.394 --> 00:24:55.067
time-being that they are
elements, but maybe that they

00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:56.529
won't be in the long run.
 

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:59.241
The idea of conservation of
mass, of course,

00:24:59.241 --> 00:24:59.808
is key.
 

00:24:59.808 --> 00:25:02.150
Oxidation as the organizing
principle.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.558
The idea of a radical,
that an element is the base of

00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:09.558
something and that it can become
an acid through oxidation.

00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:16.288
And the idea of salts,
from mixing of elements.

00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:20.559
And with respect to words,
the idea that names should be

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.746
meaningful;
in particular,

00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:26.190
the names for elements,
oxidation state.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.384
So he developed these suffixes;
-ous, -ic, -ide,

00:25:30.384 --> 00:25:33.670
-ite and -ate are all due to
Lavoisier.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:38.513
And the idea of a salt
composition, the way of naming

00:25:38.513 --> 00:25:42.335
them, that sodium hydrox-ide,
for example,

00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:45.409
or sodium chlor-ide,
or chlor-ate,

00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:49.719
or chlor-ite;
which are different degrees of

00:25:49.719 --> 00:25:51.920
oxidation of the element.
 

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.981
But, like everyone who would
follow, and everyone before,

00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:59.391
and everyone nowadays,
he was plagued by lack of

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.261
imagination.
 

00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:01.058
Right?
 

00:26:01.058 --> 00:26:05.180
That's always the short suit of
everyone who's in science,

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.058
or probably in anything.
 

00:26:07.058 --> 00:26:11.123
He said, at the end of this
preface that we've talked about:

00:26:11.123 --> 00:26:13.740
"Chemistry's present
progress,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.068
however, is so rapid,
and the facts,

00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:18.747
under modern doctrine,
have assumed so happy an

00:26:18.747 --> 00:26:21.553
arrangement,
that we have ground to hope,

00:26:21.553 --> 00:26:25.103
even in our own times,
to see it approach near to the

00:26:25.103 --> 00:26:28.891
highest state of perfection of
which it is susceptible."

00:26:28.891 --> 00:26:29.460
Right?
 

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.585
So people always think that;
that there are a few things you

00:26:33.585 --> 00:26:37.242
see you have to do to fill in
little chinks here and there,

00:26:37.242 --> 00:26:39.199
but otherwise we've got it now.
 

00:26:39.199 --> 00:26:39.828
Right?
 

00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:43.448
This is certainly what a lot of
people tended to think about the

00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:44.308
human genome.
 

00:26:44.308 --> 00:26:47.729
Once you know what the human
genome is, then all diseases are

00:26:47.729 --> 00:26:49.096
solved, everything else.
 

00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:49.608
Right?
 

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:52.756
It's never been true and it
almost certainly is not true

00:26:52.756 --> 00:26:53.098
now.
 

00:26:53.098 --> 00:26:55.269
And it certainly wasn't true in
his time.

00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:57.269
He said, "even in our own
times."

00:26:57.269 --> 00:27:03.269
He wrote this in 1789,
and in 1794 he was guillotined.

00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:04.259
&gt;
 

00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:07.818
So it certainly didn't happen
in his own time.

00:27:07.818 --> 00:27:12.828
The judge, Coffinhal,
is reported to have said,

00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:16.211
although perhaps apocryphally,
that "the Republic has no

00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:17.618
need of geniuses."
 

00:27:17.618 --> 00:27:19.982
And, in fact,
all his equipment was seized

00:27:19.982 --> 00:27:22.346
for The People,
including his 80 pounds of

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:24.884
mercury that he carried around
in this thing,

00:27:24.884 --> 00:27:26.210
to measure gases.
 

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:32.119
That madness lasted only a
couple of years;

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:33.670
maybe not even that long.
 

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.055
And his widow recovered the
equipment, and it currently is

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:40.500
in the Musée des Arts et
Métiers in Paris.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.742
I've never seen it,
but a number of students from

00:27:43.742 --> 00:27:48.000
the class have sent me postcards
when they've gone to see it.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.520
Okay, and Lagrange,
the guy that helped him build

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.865
the calorimeter,
wrote: "It took them only

00:27:53.865 --> 00:27:56.680
an instant to make this head
fall,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.700
but 100 years may not suffice
to reproduce one like it."

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.053
So what we're going to look at
is what the heads in the next

00:28:04.053 --> 00:28:06.098
100 years were able to
accomplish.

00:28:06.098 --> 00:28:08.788
So today we're going to do the
first twenty,

00:28:08.788 --> 00:28:11.038
or twenty-five,
or thirty years after

00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:13.538
Lavoisier, to see where things
went.

00:28:13.538 --> 00:28:16.769
So we've looked at Boyle and
his gas laws,

00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:18.028
and Lavoisier.
 

00:28:18.028 --> 00:28:20.880
And now we're going to go on to
Dalton.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.766
So here's John Dalton,
who lived up near the Lake

00:28:23.766 --> 00:28:25.088
District in England.
 

00:28:25.088 --> 00:28:27.778
And he was an amateur
meteorologist.

00:28:27.778 --> 00:28:30.578
So he was interested in keeping
weather records and so on.

00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:33.118
And in particular he was
interested in why,

00:28:33.118 --> 00:28:36.189
in the atmosphere,
if you collect air at the top

00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:39.182
of a mountain,
and down in the bottom of a

00:28:39.182 --> 00:28:41.328
valley,
you get the same composition.

00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:45.710
Why don't the heavier gases
sink and the lighter ones rise?

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.548
Good question, right?
 

00:28:48.548 --> 00:28:52.405
Well people on the continent
had proposed that different

00:28:52.405 --> 00:28:54.368
gases attract one another.
 

00:28:54.368 --> 00:28:57.325
So they tend to stick and
therefore stay mixed.

00:28:57.325 --> 00:28:57.839
Right?
 

00:28:57.839 --> 00:28:59.848
But Dalton had a different idea.
 

00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:02.509
And this is a picture he drew
of gases.

00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:05.078
The top is Azote,
or nitrogen,

00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:07.150
and the bottom is hydrogen.
 

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:12.672
So he said, "The atoms of
one kind did not repel the atoms

00:29:12.672 --> 00:29:14.808
of another kind."
 

00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:16.690
It's not -- well you'll see in
just a second.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.690
Okay, so the center is his
symbol for the atom;

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:20.710
nitrogen in that case.
 

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.105
And surrounding it,
this sort of halo,

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:26.601
is the "envelope"
that's heat associated with

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:28.220
that particular atom.
 

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.038
So these rays come out.
 

00:29:30.038 --> 00:29:33.673
And if the rays meet one
another, between adjacent atoms

00:29:33.673 --> 00:29:36.450
in the gas, then they repel one
another;

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.150
according to Dalton's theory.
 

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.740
But if they don't match,
as in hydrogen and nitrogen,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.019
then they don't repel one
another.

00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:44.710
Right?
 

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.842
So atoms of the same element
tend to stay apart,

00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:51.972
but atoms of the other element
are completely free to be inside

00:29:51.972 --> 00:29:52.640
there.
 

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.160
They knew that the pressure
went down, as you went up;

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.839
that was no question, right?
 

00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.660
But why don't they stratify?
 

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.826
It's because the different
elements don't repel one

00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:02.460
another.
 

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.239
So he substituted
homorepulsion,

00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:10.618
that the same atoms repel one
another, for what the Europeans

00:30:10.618 --> 00:30:13.220
used as heteroattraction.
 

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.288
Okay?
 

00:30:14.288 --> 00:30:16.450
Obviously that turned out to be
nonsense.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:21.219
But Dalton developed three
principles, in terms of these

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:26.422
atoms that he had started using
for this purpose of something

00:30:26.422 --> 00:30:28.588
about the atmosphere.
 

00:30:28.588 --> 00:30:32.023
These principles have come to
be known as Definite

00:30:32.023 --> 00:30:35.387
Proportions, Equivalent
Proportions, and Multiple

00:30:35.387 --> 00:30:36.509
Proportions.
 

00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:40.945
So Definite Proportions is that
pure compounds always have the

00:30:40.945 --> 00:30:43.710
same weight ratio of their
elements.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:49.220
So you don't get a sample,
of sugar here,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.338
that's a certain percentage of
carbon and hydrogen,

00:30:52.338 --> 00:30:54.483
and a slightly different
percentage of carbon and

00:30:54.483 --> 00:30:55.200
hydrogen here.
 

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.582
And he explains it by saying
that these compounds are a given

00:30:58.582 --> 00:30:59.710
ratio of elements.
 

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.087
So you have that same ratio all
the time when you have a

00:31:03.087 --> 00:31:04.440
particular compound.
 

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.563
Now Equivalent Proportions is a
pretty simple idea,

00:31:07.563 --> 00:31:09.000
but it looks complex.
 

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.854
Okay, so suppose you have a
certain weight of A reacts with

00:31:12.854 --> 00:31:16.019
a certain weight of B;
okay, to form AB.

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:16.730
Okay?
 

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.688
And a certain amount of A
reacts with a certain amount of

00:31:20.688 --> 00:31:21.818
C, to form AC.
 

00:31:21.818 --> 00:31:26.142
But if it's the same amount of
A, then in some sense that

00:31:26.142 --> 00:31:31.160
weight of B and that weight of C
are equivalent to one another.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.788
Okay?
 

00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:34.960
Because they react with the
same weight of A;

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.890
so they're equivalent.
 

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.780
But now suppose you have
another compound D that also

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.980
reacts with b parts of B.
 

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.858
A reacted with b parts
of B. Right?

00:31:46.858 --> 00:31:51.588
What does that tell you,
about equivalence?

00:31:51.588 --> 00:31:54.130
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.333
Prof: That means that
a parts of A is

00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:59.640
equivalent to d parts of
D.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.038
Okay?
 

00:32:02.038 --> 00:32:08.222
So just suppose two grams of A
reacted with three grams of B,

00:32:08.222 --> 00:32:13.480
and two grams of A reacted with
eight grams of C.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.113
That means three grams of B is
equal to eight grams of C,

00:32:17.113 --> 00:32:18.930
for purposes of combining.
 

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:19.640
Okay?
 

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.430
And suppose 1.5 grams of D also
reacted with three grams of B.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.430
Then 1.5 grams of D is equal to
one gram of A.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.740
Okay?
 

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.588
Now what could you conclude?
 

00:32:32.588 --> 00:32:34.160
What's the final line going to
be?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.462
What do you predict from this,
if you have these kinds of

00:32:36.462 --> 00:32:38.958
equivalence;
an equivalence between B and C

00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:41.259
and an equivalence between A and
B?

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:44.288
Can you see?
 

00:32:44.288 --> 00:32:48.276
Then you predict that if you
react D and C,

00:32:48.276 --> 00:32:50.650
what's going to happen?
 

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.588
What weight ratio will they be
in?

00:32:52.588 --> 00:32:53.980
Student:  d parts
of --

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.464
Prof: Okay,
d parts of D will react

00:32:56.464 --> 00:32:58.328
with c parts of
C.***Right?

00:32:58.328 --> 00:33:01.588
Because the D is like the A in
the beginning.

00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:03.720
The C is like the B in the
beginning.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.858
So d parts of D should
react with c parts of C.

00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:07.730
That's what multiple
Proportions is.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.180
I'll show you an example.
 

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.210
Okay?
 

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.160
And finally Multiple
Proportions.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.315
If the same two elements form
several different compounds,

00:33:16.315 --> 00:33:19.960
the weight ratios are related
by simple factors.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.328
And I'll show you an example of
that.

00:33:22.328 --> 00:33:27.073
So these are all things that
Dalton adduced as support for

00:33:27.073 --> 00:33:32.150
the idea that things were made
of atoms, fundamental units.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.150
Now Definite Proportions.
 

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:39.038
Does the same compound always
have the same ratio of the

00:33:39.038 --> 00:33:40.548
elements in it?
 

00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:44.420
The French School was divided
on this question.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.970
Berthollet said,
"Non!"

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:52.265
Because he said they're metal
alloys, or natural

00:33:52.265 --> 00:33:56.560
"organic"
materials that vary in their

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.384
analysis.
 

00:33:57.384 --> 00:33:58.390
Right?
 

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.348
Okay?
 

00:33:59.348 --> 00:34:02.386
And Proust said,
"Oui!"

00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:03.009
Right?
 

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:08.969
And that defined
what chemistry was;

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:12.528
that chemists then began to
deal only with things that

00:34:12.528 --> 00:34:15.349
obeyed this Law of Multiple
Proportions.

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:19.295
They didn't deal in fundamental
ways with alloys or with

00:34:19.295 --> 00:34:24.030
complicated big molecules that
had really complicated formulas,

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.106
or couldn't be separated as
mixtures and therefore got

00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:29.429
different analyses at different
times.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.021
They assumed that anything that
was pure had this -- obeyed the

00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:34.760
Law of Definite Proportions.
 

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:39.829
So it was really more of a
definition, than a law.

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:42.980
Okay, now Multiple Proportions.
 

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.893
So there were oxides of carbon;
you remember Lavoisier,

00:34:46.893 --> 00:34:51.119
1789, defined 44% carbon and
56% oxygen in CO_2.

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:53.873
And again there are problems
for you to work together to see

00:34:53.873 --> 00:34:55.460
how he did some of these things.
 

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.179
So that's one of them,
I believe.

00:34:57.179 --> 00:35:00.889
And then in 1801 carbonic acid,
as it was called,

00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:05.295
was analyzed and found to be
twenty-one grams of carbon to

00:35:05.295 --> 00:35:07.769
seventy-two grams of oxygen.
 

00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:08.349
Okay?
 

00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:13.480
Or in the case of nitrogen,
there were several oxides that

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.170
had these ratios,
all as analyzed in 1810.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.070
Right?
 

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.550
Now, you can look at the weight
ratios, if you want to.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:24.096
Oxygen to carbon ratio in the
first one is 1.27,

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:25.179
the other is 2.57.
 

00:35:25.179 --> 00:35:30.920
Or you can look in the oxides
of nitrogen, and they're

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.545
0.58,1.27,2.39.
 

00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:33.518
Right?
 

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:38.860
Now, what do you notice about
these?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.929
Do you learn anything from this?
 

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:47.797
These guys got these results
and sat down and scratched their

00:35:47.797 --> 00:35:48.179
heads.
 

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.190
What did they come up with?
 

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.860
Anything profound?
 

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:56.179
Any relationships among these
numbers, that you can see?

00:35:56.179 --> 00:36:03.909
Or are they just sort of random
numbers?

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:04.230
Yes.
 

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.199
Nick?
 

00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:07.840
Student:  The ratio is
kind of like --

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.489
Prof: Can you speak up a
little bit?

00:36:08.489 --> 00:36:10.349
Student:  1.27 is half
of --

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:13.655
Prof: Ah,
1.27 is very close to half of

00:36:13.655 --> 00:36:14.170
2.57.
 

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.041
It's not exact,
but there's going to be

00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:16.976
experimental error.
 

00:36:16.976 --> 00:36:17.420
Right?
 

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.320
It's about one to two;
it's actually 2.02.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.166
And if you look in the case of
nitrogen, it's 1:2:4.

00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:25.769
Right?
 

00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:28.199
It's actually 2.19 and 4.12.
 

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:31.652
So as always,
when people develop things

00:36:31.652 --> 00:36:35.460
experimentally and observe
regularities,

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.666
there's a question of what's
real and what's just

00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:41.157
experimental error;
and you have no way of knowing

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:41.809
at the beginning.
 

00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:45.132
We have a way of knowing now
because we know what the true

00:36:45.132 --> 00:36:45.949
weights are.
 

00:36:45.949 --> 00:36:49.472
So they're integral values
consistent with simple atomic

00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:50.050
ratios.
 

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.280
So now we know what the percent
errors were in these things.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.152
Okay, that the ratio of the
error was about 5% or 4% off

00:36:59.152 --> 00:37:03.849
from what it should've been in
the oxygen:nitrogen.

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:07.768
One is minus 2%,
the others are plus 11%.

00:37:07.768 --> 00:37:12.012
So within roughly 5% or so,
they were doing a pretty job of

00:37:12.012 --> 00:37:13.110
the analysis.
 

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.556
But they were able to see
through to this Law of Multiple

00:37:16.556 --> 00:37:17.420
Proportions.
 

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.523
And that's what you would
expect, if these things were

00:37:20.523 --> 00:37:24.155
made up of identical molecules
with simple ratios of numbers of

00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:25.210
atoms in them.
 

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.090
So this tended to support
Dalton's ideas of atoms.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.739
Okay, so we've looked at
Lavoisier.

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:36.172
And now we're on further into
elemental analysis,

00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:40.105
doing accurate elemental
analysis, and the idea of atoms

00:37:40.105 --> 00:37:41.250
and dualism.
 

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.840
And we'll see what that is
right away.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.615
And to do that we're going to
focus on Berzelius,

00:37:47.615 --> 00:37:50.900
but also talk about Gay-Lussac.
 

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.730
Okay, so there's Faraday,
whom we've talked about

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.141
already;
Berzelius and Gay-Lussac,

00:37:56.141 --> 00:37:58.110
and also Davy,
in England.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.539
Okay, so here's Berzelius in
Sweden.

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:02.320
Born in 1779.
 

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.871
Notice on the previous slide,
all those guys were born within

00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:08.389
a year, 1778,1779.
 

00:38:08.389 --> 00:38:11.012
Another guy that was born at
the same time didn't make it to

00:38:11.012 --> 00:38:13.411
the list, but his statue is
right below, who's Benjamin

00:38:13.411 --> 00:38:15.639
Silliman;
he was exactly the same time.

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:19.027
Okay, so here's Berzelius,
who lived to be almost seventy

00:38:19.027 --> 00:38:21.630
years old, and did an awful lot
of stuff.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.543
So he was very good at
analysis, both of organic

00:38:25.543 --> 00:38:27.960
substances and of minerals.
 

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.088
In a period of six years he
accurately analyzed 2000

00:38:32.088 --> 00:38:34.599
compounds for their elements.
 

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:35.768
Okay?
 

00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:38.989
He developed really good atomic
weights.

00:38:38.989 --> 00:38:42.594
Remember, we just saw that
these previous ones were off by

00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:45.755
as much as 10 or 11%,
but he got very good ones for

00:38:45.755 --> 00:38:47.590
fifty different elements.
 

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.389
Okay?
 

00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:51.030
He studied electrolysis,
which we will see,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.800
and used that to develop the
theory of dualism and how --

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.840
understanding reactions as
double decompositions;

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.768
and we'll shortly see what that
is.

00:38:59.768 --> 00:39:01.960
And he did a lot of teaching
and writing.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.199
He was the most respected
chemist worldwide.

00:39:05.199 --> 00:39:08.539
He chose in his picture --
remember,

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:09.920
when these people got these
pictures painted,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.550
they always chose some emblem
to put in,

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.699
and he chose his textbook that
he wrote in 1803 .

00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:19.429
But he was a very important
editor and summarizer of the

00:39:19.429 --> 00:39:22.280
year's progress in chemistry
every year.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.233
And he developed the notation
that we still use for

00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:27.340
composition.
 

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.840
So you'll see that.
 

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.460
Okay, notation for composition.
 

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.777
We're going to look at its
evolution, from alchemy through

00:39:34.777 --> 00:39:37.164
Dalton to Berzelius,
which is what we use,

00:39:37.164 --> 00:39:38.268
almost exactly.
 

00:39:38.268 --> 00:39:42.503
Okay, so in 1774,
this is a table printed in

00:39:42.503 --> 00:39:47.130
Sweden of symbols for elements
and compounds.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.570
And you see,
for example,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:55.980
here's vitriolum cupri,
or vitriolum coeruleum.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.280
Do you know what about
cupri;

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.030
that's the symbol there of
copper, right?

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:08.210
So why would it have been
called coeruleum?

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.119
Can you see any word that's
related to that?

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:11.050
Student:  Cerulean.
 

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.309
Prof: What's cerulean
about it?

00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:15.559
Student:  The color.
 

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:17.739
Prof: I got some here.
 

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:23.469
That's not it.
 

00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:25.739
That's not it.
 

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:26.909
This is it.
 

00:40:26.909 --> 00:40:28.989
It's cerulean, right?
 

00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:31.619
Like the sky.
 

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:32.590
Okay.
 

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.018
Or iron, there's the alchemical
symbol of iron.

00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:39.719
Or and vitriol means
sulfate, right?;

00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:44.019
or mercury sulfate;
okay, lead.

00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:44.349
Okay?
 

00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:45.449
So these are the chemical
symbols.

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:48.021
Notice particularly
nitrum,

00:40:48.021 --> 00:40:51.059
at the top, that comes from
nitrates.

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:56.425
Okay, and we'll focus on that
and see that that's exactly the

00:40:56.425 --> 00:41:00.360
same symbol that Dalton used for
nitrogen.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.210
So he derived his symbols for
atoms from the alchemical

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.789
symbols;
at least many of them.

00:41:04.789 --> 00:41:06.010
Not all of them.
 

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.980
Here are some others.
 

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.445
And here are the symbols that
Berzelius used for the same

00:41:10.445 --> 00:41:13.539
elements, which you see are the
ones we use now.

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:14.719
Okay?
 

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:17.447
So notice as -- so there were
alchemical symbols at the

00:41:17.447 --> 00:41:19.614
beginning for Dalton,
as you went across,

00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:22.579
but in the next row,
once you get to iron,

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:25.820
which is Fe in Berzelius,
can you see what it is?

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.440
It's a little hard to read at
this resolution.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.610
It's a little circle with a
letter inside.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.409
What's the letter for iron?
 

00:41:33.409 --> 00:41:35.820
Can you see it?
 

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.809
It's in the middle of the
second row.

00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:40.510
It's an 'I'.
 

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.768
I'm sorry it's not such a good
resolution.

00:41:42.768 --> 00:41:46.989
And the next one is Z and then
C and the L.

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:49.710
Why?
 

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.179
Z?
 

00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:51.659
Student:  Zinc.
 

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:52.849
Prof: Zinc.
 

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:53.579
C?
 

00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:55.289
Student:  Copper.
 

00:41:55.289 --> 00:41:56.110
Prof: Copper.
 

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:56.929
L?
 

00:41:56.929 --> 00:41:57.610
Student:  Lead.
 

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.329
Prof: Lead.
 

00:41:58.329 --> 00:41:59.659
And so on.
 

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:04.280
Okay, now down below that are
binary symbols.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.280
So you put two elements
together, like H with O,

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.768
H with N, N with O,
H with C, O with C.

00:42:11.768 --> 00:42:15.969
Now here's Dalton's logic about
these symbols.

00:42:15.969 --> 00:42:21.092
He says, "When only one
combination of two bodies can be

00:42:21.092 --> 00:42:25.960
obtained, it must be presumed to
be a binary one."

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.463
That is, if you get only one
compound, it must be one atom of

00:42:30.463 --> 00:42:32.713
one and one atom of the other.
 

00:42:32.713 --> 00:42:33.389
Right?
 

00:42:33.389 --> 00:42:35.460
So what would water be?
 

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.599
Student:  H.
 

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:40.277
Prof: HO,
or his circle with a dot in the

00:42:40.277 --> 00:42:40.824
circle.
 

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:41.530
Right?
 

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:44.027
"Unless some other cause
appear to the contrary"

00:42:44.027 --> 00:42:46.699
that would show you that that's
not what you should assume.

00:42:46.699 --> 00:42:50.641
Okay, the next row,
the ternary ones:

00:42:50.641 --> 00:42:52.940
N2O, NO2, CO2,
CH2.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.005
And what he said about that is:
"When two combinations are

00:42:56.005 --> 00:42:58.251
observed,
of the same elements,

00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:03.210
then they must be presumed to
be a binary and a ternary."

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.780
So you could have NO and NO2.
 

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.648
What if there are three
combinations of the same

00:43:09.648 --> 00:43:11.539
elements that give compounds?
 

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:14.092
Do you see what he's going to
observe, what he's going to

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:14.550
suppose?
 

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.579
Student:  Binary.
 

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:19.092
Prof: Right?
 

00:43:19.092 --> 00:43:23.155
"When threeâ€¦
a binary, and the other two

00:43:23.155 --> 00:43:24.510
ternary."
 

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.070
Okay?
 

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:31.780
Okay, and what about if there
are four?

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.755
"When fourâ€¦
one binary, two ternary,

00:43:35.755 --> 00:43:38.039
and one quaternary."
 

00:43:38.039 --> 00:43:38.610
Okay?
 

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.661
So he's laying down rules of
logic for what,

00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.650
the way atoms must behave.
 

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.465
And it turns out,
as we know, atoms have

00:43:46.465 --> 00:43:49.210
different ideas from Dalton's
logic.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:53.800
There's nothing illogical about
Dalton, it's just wrong.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.976
Okay, and this is Berzelius's
notation for the same symbols

00:43:57.976 --> 00:44:00.210
that Dalton gave on the left.
 

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.916
But you notice they're
completely recognizable to them,

00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:04.070
except for one thing.
 

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.420
What's different?
 

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.159
Student: Superscripts
instead of subscripts.

00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:12.389
Prof: Here was ours,
and here is Berzelius's.

00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:16.340
The only difference is he used
superscripts instead of

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.309
subscripts.
 

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:18.420
Okay?
 

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.554
And he decided to base the
names on Latin,

00:44:20.554 --> 00:44:23.264
so it would be international,
whereas Dalton had used

00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:23.889
English.
 

00:44:23.889 --> 00:44:26.929
And the formulas,
notice, are not structural.

00:44:26.929 --> 00:44:29.661
Berzelius's aren't,
they're just written in a line

00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:30.610
and the number.
 

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.864
These could've been assumed to
be structural,

00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:35.530
that you thought the atoms were
arranged that way.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.030
I don't know that Dalton really
had that idea,

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.030
but they sort of convey that
idea.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.244
But Berzelius's don't,
they're just a list of the

00:44:43.244 --> 00:44:46.860
elements and the ratio,
by weight, of atoms in them.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.429
And he developed some more
fancy abbreviations as well,

00:44:50.429 --> 00:44:52.556
where, for example,
these little dots above

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:55.849
elements would who show how much
oxygen was associated with it.

00:44:55.849 --> 00:45:00.697
So that chromate
potassique was K with an O,

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:03.510
and chromium with three Os.
 

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.989
Or down here he has some even
fancier things.

00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:09.829
Notice the superscripts denote
the number of atoms.

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:16.219
And this benzoic acid should be
H_10C_14O_3.

00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:20.762
Now wait a second,
a carboxylic acid has how many

00:45:20.762 --> 00:45:21.710
oxygens?
 

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.099
Carboxylate group?
 

00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:23.690
Students:  Two.
 

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.159
Prof: Two.
 

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:25.449
Here he's got three.
 

00:45:25.449 --> 00:45:28.530
The reason is that he felt
there was water in these acids.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.181
So he heated the heck out of
them to drive the water out,

00:45:31.181 --> 00:45:33.880
and what you actually were left
with was the anhydride.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.469
So two acids had come together
and lost water.

00:45:36.469 --> 00:45:36.929
Right?
 

00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:41.706
So the formula should be
C_10C_14O_3, and he's got

00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:42.780
H_12C_15.
 

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.150
So not so far off.
 

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.282
And he's got these neat symbols
for acetic, tartaric,

00:45:48.282 --> 00:45:50.268
citric and so on,
acid.

00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:51.730
But those didn't catch on
either.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:55.969
But his symbols for the
elements did.

00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:58.829
Now let's see what we got here,
I had one more topic.

00:45:58.829 --> 00:46:00.400
Atomic weights and equivalents.
 

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.063
Okay, these are Dalton's atomic
weights that he used in 1808:

00:46:05.063 --> 00:46:07.007
hydrogen one,
carbon five,

00:46:07.007 --> 00:46:09.106
nitrogen five,
oxygen seven,

00:46:09.106 --> 00:46:10.349
and so on.
 

00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:13.949
Now as of 2004,
this is what they should've

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:14.550
been.
 

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:20.010
What's wrong with Dalton?
 

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.985
Why is he off so far,
for example,

00:46:23.985 --> 00:46:30.610
in oxygen, which should be
sixteen, and he has seven?

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.409
How can he be off that much?
 

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:33.639
Charles?
 

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:34.380
Can't hear.
 

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.800
Student:  Diatomic.
 

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.320
Prof: Yeah,
what did he think water was?

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:38.820
Student:  HO.
 

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.400
Prof: HO.
 

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.710
We know it's H_2O.
 

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.757
So the ratio is off by a factor
of two.

00:46:44.757 --> 00:46:45.190
Right?
 

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.806
So all these are off -- most of
these are off by a factor of two

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:52.539
or three, depending on what the
true formula we now know to be.

00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:53.139
Okay?
 

00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:55.884
But if you make that
correction, this is what kind of

00:46:55.884 --> 00:46:57.889
errors he had in his atomic
weights.

00:46:57.889 --> 00:47:01.202
There were roughly 10% or so
errors.

00:47:01.202 --> 00:47:01.960
Right?
 

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.119
And the question in silicon
chloride.

00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:09.369
Thomas Thomson in Scotland
thought it was SiCl.

00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:11.960
Gmelin in Germany thought it
was SiCl_2.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.342
Berzelius thought it was
SiCl_3_ and Odling in

00:47:15.342 --> 00:47:17.309
England thought it was SiCl_4.
 

00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:20.500
So you could have anything you
wanted.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.190
Right?
 

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:22.250
So which one is it?
 

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.349
How can you tell which one it
is?

00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:26.420
That's the problem.
 

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:31.489
Okay, this is when Gay-Lussac
in France gets into the act.

00:47:31.489 --> 00:47:36.572
So in 1804, he and the
physicist Biot made a balloon

00:47:36.572 --> 00:47:40.159
ascent to a height of 7000
meters.

00:47:40.159 --> 00:47:41.420
That's way the heck up there.
 

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.585
And in fact,
that was a record for fifty

00:47:43.585 --> 00:47:44.030
years.
 

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.239
And they have a big flask
they're carrying.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:48.599
Why?
 

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.699
What do they want to do with
their big flask?

00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:52.690
Student:  The flask was
to collect air.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.757
Prof: Collect air at
7000 meters and see if it's

00:47:55.757 --> 00:47:56.440
different.
 

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440
Okay?
 

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.978
Okay, so they established that
the atmospheric composition is

00:47:59.978 --> 00:48:03.025
invariant with altitude;
at least at the heights they

00:48:03.025 --> 00:48:03.719
could do.
 

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:05.652
But that's not the most
important thing he did,

00:48:05.652 --> 00:48:06.409
for our purpose.
 

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:09.635
One of the really important
things he did was figure out how

00:48:09.635 --> 00:48:12.150
to oxidize sugar,
how to burn sugar cleanly.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.840
Remember, Lavoisier had to
resort to fermentation.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.806
But he found if the source of
the oxidation was sodium

00:48:17.806 --> 00:48:19.811
chlorate,
then you could heat them

00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:22.643
together and actually get it
right and get water and

00:48:22.643 --> 00:48:24.420
CO_2_ out of sugar.
 

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.280
So that was a very important
practical contribution.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.202
For the present purposes,
he found that when you

00:48:31.202 --> 00:48:35.791
decompose water you get,
to one volume of oxygen you get

00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:38.380
1.9989 volumes of hydrogen.
 

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.972
And if you do the same thing
with ammonia,

00:48:40.972 --> 00:48:44.768
for a volume of nitrogen you
get 3.08163 volumes of hydrogen,

00:48:44.768 --> 00:48:46.159
in his experiment.
 

00:48:46.159 --> 00:48:49.849
What did he conclude?
 

00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:52.510
What was Gay-Lussac's
conclusion for this?

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.079
Student:  H2.
 

00:48:53.079 --> 00:48:56.637
Prof: What do you think
he thought the values would've

00:48:56.637 --> 00:48:59.130
been if there was no
experimental error?

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.989
How much hydrogen would he have
gotten?

00:49:00.989 --> 00:49:01.750
Student:  Two.
 

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:02.398
Prof: Two.
 

00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:04.610
And how much hydrogen would he
have gotten from nitrogen?

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.449
Student:  Three.
 

00:49:05.449 --> 00:49:06.559
Prof: Three. Right?
 

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.686
They're very,
very close, just a few percent

00:49:08.686 --> 00:49:08.884
off.
 

00:49:08.884 --> 00:49:09.329
Right?
 

00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:13.159
And even closer in the case of
water.

00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:17.768
So what did he think?
 

00:49:17.768 --> 00:49:21.195
He thought the number,
that the volume of a gas was

00:49:21.195 --> 00:49:24.003
proportional to the number of
atoms in it.

00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:24.690
Right?
 

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.269
Whose name do you associate
that with?

00:49:26.269 --> 00:49:27.400
Student: Avogadro.
 

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.369
Prof: Avogadro.
 

00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:31.317
But both of them did it,
independently,

00:49:31.317 --> 00:49:35.659
and Gay-Lussac is the one whose
data I'm showing here.

00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:38.652
Okay, so this was an
alternative to Dalton's Law of

00:49:38.652 --> 00:49:39.969
Greatest Simplicity.
 

00:49:39.969 --> 00:49:43.889
Dalton said if there's only one
compound, it must be one to one.

00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:46.059
Gay-Lussac said look at the gas
ratios.

00:49:46.059 --> 00:49:48.420
And that turned out to be
correct;

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:54.146
although it didn't get
completely adopted for another

00:49:54.146 --> 00:49:55.690
sixty years.
 

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.110
That's really funny.
 

00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:59.880
Okay, that's enough for now.

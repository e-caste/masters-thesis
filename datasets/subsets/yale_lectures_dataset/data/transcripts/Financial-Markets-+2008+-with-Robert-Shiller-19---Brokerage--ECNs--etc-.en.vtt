00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.761
Professor Robert
Shiller: What I want to talk

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.032
about today is about places
where stocks are exchanged--or

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:14.560
bonds or other securities.
It's another huge industry.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.767
I would say it's part of our
information technology--our

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.483
information network.
What we have to do is find a

00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:25.970
national or international price
for a security.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.563
The problem is that when
securities are traded without a

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.820
central market,
different people will be

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.830
getting different prices for the
same thing.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.650
We have what's called--or maybe
the term--what markets do for us

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.630
is--the important term is "price
discovery."

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.761
That means that there is a
market price that an asset would

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:03.263
have if everybody in the whole
world were free to buy and sell

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:07.250
the asset on the same market and
at the same time.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.713
But if you don't have an
organized exchange,

00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:18.459
which is open and available to
everybody without a lot of cost,

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:23.175
then you don't have effective
price discovery and that means

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:28.290
that nobody knows what the asset
is worth in the whole market.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.882
We take price discovery for
granted but we have to realize

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:35.537
that there's a technology that
brought us that and it's the

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:38.626
technology that we want to
emphasize that has been

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.730
improving over the years;
it's not static.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.095
I wanted to start by just
defining some important terms

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:53.870
regarding exchange of
securities.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.228
One important term is
"broker"--and I'll put it over

00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:06.811
here--another one is "dealer."
Those are the two kinds of

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:14.605
people who trade securities.
It's important to keep the

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:21.252
concept, so one thing that's
used to describe is to start

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:26.711
with the letters
BOAC--that sounds likes

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:32.290
it's British Overseas Airways
Corporation,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.127
but that's not what I mean.
This is a mnemonic to remember

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:41.681
broker.
It says brokers act on

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:53.290
Behalf or for
Others as an Agent

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.890
for which they earn a
Commission.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.612
A broker goes between two
people and the two people trade

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:19.997
with each other.
The broker makes it happen and

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:26.355
the broker receives a fee called
a commission for bringing these

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:32.006
people together so that they
could find each and make the

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:37.809
deal--make the trade.
For dealer, we have a

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:42.200
different--it's DHPM.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:02.596
A Dealer acts for
Herself or Himself

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:13.790
as a Principal for a
Markup;

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.139
that's the fundamental
difference.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:26.431
In contrast to a broker,
the dealer actually buys and

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:34.283
sells himself or herself and
that means the dealer has an

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:41.994
inventory of whatever it is
that--so that the dealer has

00:04:41.994 --> 00:04:47.919
something to sell.
If you go to a dealer and buy a

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.956
security, you're buying it from
the dealer out of the dealer's

00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:56.700
inventory.
If you sell through a dealer,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.430
you sell to the dealer.
There's a fundamental diff--the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.472
markup is the difference between
the price that the dealer buys

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:12.220
and sells at;
so, you see that there's a

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.684
fundamental difference.
Now, securities law says that

00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:21.342
you can never function as both a
broker and a dealer in the same

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:24.230
transaction.
You've got to be one or the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.240
other.
The same person can do both.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.470
You can be both a broker and a
dealer, but not in the same

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.537
transaction.
We also have the term in

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:50.089
finance "broker-dealer" and
that's called BD.

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:58.420
A BD is a firm that hires--that
employs brokers and dealers.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.187
The fact that they hyphenate
them doesn't mean that any one

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:09.160
transaction involves both
brokering and dealing.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.579
You can see the difference in
ordinary life.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:23.749
When you buy and sell a house,
your real estate agent is a

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.079
broker.
The real estate agent usually

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:29.990
does not buy the house from you
if you're selling your house.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.256
Or if you call up a real estate
agent and say,

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:36.740
"I want to sell my house," the
agent doesn't say,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.699
"okay I'll buy it;"
so, that person is operating as

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.898
a broker.
However, if you go to an

00:06:44.898 --> 00:06:50.157
antique shop and say you want to
buy a chest of drawers or a

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:53.900
dining room table,
you'll be dealing with a

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.876
dealer.
I guess there are fundamental

00:06:56.876 --> 00:07:01.085
reasons in why it works out well
in one and why it tends to break

00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:04.504
down differently for the
different--why is it that we

00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:07.990
have dealers for antiques and
brokers for homes?

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.998
Well, I think it has something
to do with--can you tell me,

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:17.721
why do we do it that way?
I was thinking it has something

00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:22.583
to do with the information cost
of--since buying a house is such

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:27.829
a big decision and you've got to
go looking at the houses anyway.

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:32.913
Somehow, antiques--you wouldn't
have an antique broker would

00:07:32.913 --> 00:07:36.759
you?
I guess you could.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.077
People could have antiques for
sale in their homes and the

00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:42.930
antique broker would take you
around on a tour.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.810
I wonder if that was my
Blackberry.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.480
I am so wired here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.510
Yes, I think it was my
Blackberry.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:23.884
The concept of a BD is that it
is something regulated,

00:08:23.884 --> 00:08:30.250
once again by the Securities
and Exchange Commission;

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.200
that means any BD must register
with the SEC.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.024
In that sense,
we have a sort of licensing for

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:49.515
BDs.
BDs in turn are responsible for

00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:55.446
their employees,
who are acting as brokers and

00:08:55.446 --> 00:09:02.694
dealers, and the employees will
have to be appropriately

00:09:02.694 --> 00:09:06.478
licensed.
What BDs do is,

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:13.587
according to our securities
law, they would manage their

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:20.179
employees exams through
FINRA--now, I mentioned that

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:23.261
before.
That's the successor to

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:26.190
National Association of
Securities Dealers;

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.720
that has exams for brokers and
dealers.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.526
What it is--a BD is a company
that hires people and they

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:44.580
become licensed as brokers or
dealers through their own BD

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.346
using FINRA,
so that's the organization

00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:52.809
method that we have.
The reason why we have it this

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:58.849
way is that there are so many
instances of bad behavior among

00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:03.580
brokers and dealers that have to
be handled.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.602
This goes back to a basic theme
of this course that human nature

00:10:07.602 --> 00:10:11.624
is imperfect and while economics
theory tries to describe people

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:14.049
as honest and following the
rules,

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:26.969
there are so many opportunities
for bad behavior that have to be

00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:32.326
corrected.
I've taken the licensing exams

00:10:32.326 --> 00:10:37.348
for FINRA because I wanted,
myself, to do creating of

00:10:37.348 --> 00:10:40.677
securities.
I think it's actually a very

00:10:40.677 --> 00:10:44.986
good program they have and they
have continuing education that

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:47.529
brokers and dealers have to
take.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.892
One thing that they do in the
continuing education--I was

00:10:50.892 --> 00:10:54.554
impressed with what they've come
up with--they have actors and

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:58.157
actresses portraying situations
that brokers and dealers will

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.879
come up with--will encounter
that are not quite ethical.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:06.545
I remember there was a scene
where a woman comes up to the

00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:11.292
broker and there's a document
that--she has a joint account

00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:15.957
with her husband and there's a
document that requires both

00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:20.312
their signatures.
The broker hands it to her and

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:24.926
she signs and then he says,
okay can you get your husband

00:11:24.926 --> 00:11:28.402
to sign it?
She says, oh he already did,

00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:33.295
look--right in front of the
broker and then they show the BD

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:38.520
backing down--this is in the
skit that I saw--and accepting,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.769
okay.
She said, I'm sure it's all

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:43.289
right with him;
so he says, all right.

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:47.134
The skit goes on and shows how
much trouble he got into for

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:49.793
accepting.
Then, the husband shows up the

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:53.581
next day and they're getting a
divorce and he's furious and he

00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:55.754
[the broker]
tries to cover it up by

00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:59.335
pretending he didn't know.
She then comes back and admits

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.040
that he [the broker]
just told me it was all right

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.690
that my husband--I could sign
for my husband.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.702
There are all kinds of moral
issues that arise and I think

00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:12.573
that the system works as well as
it does because we have

00:12:12.573 --> 00:12:15.422
institutions.
We recognize that there's a

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.870
tendency for all kinds of bad
behavior.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:24.178
My own experience with FINRA
was increased confidence in our

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:27.112
BDs.
I think that we have a good

00:12:27.112 --> 00:12:32.121
system--that there's going to be
a lot of temptation for bad

00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:35.681
behavior.
We have a pretty good system in

00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:39.779
this country for educating
people not to do that.

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:46.854
We also actually go after BDs
who do things that are seemingly

00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:49.381
innocent.
For example,

00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:53.029
churning--I mentioned this
before.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:58.529
Churning is overtrading a
customer's account.

00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:05.022
It's not obvious to uninformed
investors that it isn't a good

00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:11.840
idea to trade stocks every other
day, but it's obvious to anyone

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.485
in the field.
If you're trading stocks that

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:19.159
frequently, there's just no way
that you could make money.

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:24.436
There's nobody who can get a
50% return on stocks with

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:27.722
reliability.
We know that David Swensen--we

00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:31.192
mentioned him before--has got
18%, but he's the star and

00:13:31.192 --> 00:13:34.409
you're not going to do that
well, realistically.

00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:38.025
If you're churning--if you're
paying more then 18% in

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:41.850
commissions every year,
you just don't have a chance.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.908
A broker could try to hide
behind some kind of

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:48.238
façade and say,
well but I think I can earn

00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:50.118
that.
But fortunately,

00:13:50.118 --> 00:13:54.241
we have good enough regulatory
agencies to stop that,

00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:57.222
so right now,
brokers who churn their

00:13:57.222 --> 00:14:01.391
portfolios will be caught by
market surveillance and they

00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.370
will be thrown out of the
profession.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.558
It's actually--you can be
disbarred--prevented from

00:14:08.558 --> 00:14:13.480
trading for life.
That's the kind of regulations

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.106
we have.
I think it's a very--the world

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:22.446
is more ambiguous and faces more
moral dilemmas than you would

00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:24.919
imagine.
You have to get out into the

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:27.940
business world and start seeing
how often they come up.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.927
It's kind of remarkable that we
have a system that handles these

00:14:31.927 --> 00:14:35.611
dilemmas as well as we do.
You see a lot of anger now,

00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:39.223
for example with the subprime
crisis, and people who

00:14:39.223 --> 00:14:42.409
supposedly or allegedly behave
very badly.

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:45.392
Certainly some of them did
behave badly,

00:14:45.392 --> 00:14:49.444
but we have a system that,
I think, has developed over

00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:52.350
many years that works pretty
well.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.993
Now these are--so,
brokers and dealers are people

00:14:57.993 --> 00:15:04.660
who work with the exchanges,
but I want to go on to talk

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:11.639
about the exchanges themselves
on which these people trade.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:16.249
This is, unfortunately,
a difficult topic to keep up

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:21.039
with because the exchanges are
changing every year.

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:25.271
I think a big impetus for
change is the advance of

00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:28.707
information technology.
I might say also,

00:15:28.707 --> 00:15:32.930
financial technology.
This is a world in rapid change;

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:39.715
it's not fixed at all.
I wanted to just talk about

00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:44.740
different kinds of exchanges
that we have.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.399
Traditionally,
we say there are--in the U.S.,

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.910
there are four markets.

00:15:53.399 --> 00:16:01.951
One of them is called the first
market and this is traditional

00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:07.840
and that is the New York Stock
Exchange.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.094
I'm going to come back--it's
now called NYSE-Euronext,

00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:13.980
but let's just be traditional
for the moment.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.642
New York Stock Exchange is the
old original stock market and

00:16:18.642 --> 00:16:21.960
the dominant one,
so we call that the first

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:28.041
market.
Then there's the second market

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:38.116
and that is NASDAQ and that
stands for National Association

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:47.149
of Securities Dealers Automatic
Quotation System;

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:52.460
that was the first electronic
exchange.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:17:00.759
It was founded--the New York
Stock Exchange was founded in

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:09.058
1792, NASDAQ was founded in
1971--very different tradition

00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:13.734
between the two.
I should say,

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:21.877
the second market--I have to
add that--is the NASDAQ National

00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:28.800
Market because NASDAQ is divided
into two parts;

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.578
there's the national market.
The third market,

00:17:32.578 --> 00:17:38.240
so called third market,
is NASDAQ small-cap;

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.930
small-cap means companies whose
capitalization is low.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.382
Capitalization,
remember, is the price per

00:17:47.382 --> 00:17:50.793
share times the number of
shares, so it's the value of the

00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:51.870
whole company.

00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:02.240
The small caps are treated
separately on NASDAQ.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:10.003
Then, there's the fourth market
and that's beyond the exchanges

00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:12.358
itself.
This is--it's large

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:15.010
institutions trading amongst
themselves;

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.725
it does happen.
There's no law saying you have

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:32.782
to go through an exchange.
You can just buy and sell

00:18:32.782 --> 00:18:36.366
whatever.
Especially if it's a very large

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:40.279
transaction it can happen that,
as part of some deal,

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:44.202
institutions will trade shares
and they don't have to go

00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:48.927
through the market.
We really think that these are

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:53.914
the most important markets.
Let me--incidentally,

00:18:53.914 --> 00:18:57.769
these are not the first stock
exchanges.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:01.230
The United States did not
invent the stock exchange.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.804
I think maybe I mentioned this
before, but Ulrike Malmondier,

00:19:05.804 --> 00:19:10.063
who is a professor at Stanford,
has researched the Ancient

00:19:10.063 --> 00:19:14.087
Roman stock exchange and claims
to have identified--I think I

00:19:14.087 --> 00:19:17.910
said this before--but has
claimed to identify where in the

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.330
Roman forum the Roman
stockbrokers worked and it was

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.107
out of a certain temple.
You can find the location when

00:19:25.107 --> 00:19:27.119
you visit Rome now.
I think it's in ruins,

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:28.840
but you can find where they
traded stocks;

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.088
it was never very big.
Then, some people in Anthrop

00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:36.429
had the first modern stock
exchange--I don't know,

00:19:36.429 --> 00:19:41.147
like many centuries ago.
Amsterdam was an early--London

00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:46.392
was an early stock exchange.
So, we came kind of late in the

00:19:46.392 --> 00:19:50.603
United States to stock
exchanges--1792 is kind of late

00:19:50.603 --> 00:19:55.960
in the world history.
However, I think that the U.S.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.229
actually features somewhat
prominently in the history of

00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:08.384
stock exchanges because there
was a New York Securities

00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:15.109
Law--1811--which became a model
for securities law and which

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:22.289
made the stock exchange in New
York especially important.

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:28.840
The 1811 Securities Law in New
York established two important

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.452
principles.
The first one was that anybody

00:20:32.452 --> 00:20:36.472
can set up a corporation and
have it traded on the stock

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:39.799
exchange.
Anybody who satisfies some

00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:44.133
criteria specified by the
securities regulator,

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:49.127
but the criteria did not
involve the state legislature

00:20:49.127 --> 00:20:52.990
convening and giving you
permission;

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.099
it was automatic.
Didn't matter who you were;

00:20:57.099 --> 00:21:01.126
they would do anybody,
but of course there were

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:03.818
restrictions.
The company may have had

00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:07.609
certain capital requirements and
the like, but it was democratic.

00:21:07.609 --> 00:21:11.165
Until then, it used to be that
in many countries companies

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:14.409
would require an act of
parliament to be found or the

00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:16.779
king would have to sign
something.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:19.509
Now, it was very clear that it
was democratic.

00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:27.489
The other thing that the New
York Securities Law of 1811 did

00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:34.521
was make it law that limited
liability was always the

00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:38.426
standard.
That is that--limited liability

00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:41.333
means that you,
as a stock market investor,

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:45.003
can never be sued for the
misdoings of the company you

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:48.626
invested in.
This was a very fundamental

00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:53.881
step in securities law because
before 1811, while there was

00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:59.498
some limited liability--the idea
was already out there and some

00:21:59.498 --> 00:22:04.935
companies put limited liability
clauses in their charters--it

00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:08.650
was never so clear as in New
York.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.956
So, you didn't want to trade
and buy a few shares on some

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:17.417
exchange because you had the
possibility of getting hit for

00:22:17.417 --> 00:22:19.750
that;
they could come after you.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.570
With the New York Securities
Law of 1811, the New York Stock

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.799
Exchange began to really prosper
because then it became something

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:34.702
that anybody in the world could
come in and buy a share there

00:22:34.702 --> 00:22:38.788
and have no worries--except,
you could only lose your money

00:22:38.788 --> 00:22:40.140
that you put in,
nothing more.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.010
That turned out to be a very
important innovation,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.855
which came in the U.S.,
and accounts,

00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:51.200
I think, for the importance of
New York in finance.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.189
It was copied later in the
nineteenth century all over

00:22:56.189 --> 00:23:02.119
Europe--this kind of securities
law--but it took a long time.

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:08.361
The New York Stock Exchange was
founded in 1792,

00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:13.009
outdoors under a buttonwood
tree.

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:15.880
I've always wondered,
what was a buttonwood tree.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.809
I guess some stock exchanges
occurred in coffee houses.

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:24.075
People used to like coffee,
just as they do now,

00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:26.099
and that's a good place to
trade stocks.

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:29.393
You would be at Starbuck's or
something in London

00:23:29.393 --> 00:23:33.236
probably--the equivalent of
Starbuck's--and it would be a

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:37.484
natural place to trade stocks.
Actually, the New York Stock

00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:40.630
Exchange was founded under a
buttonwood tree.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.168
I looked it up,
a buttonwood tree is just a

00:23:43.168 --> 00:23:46.432
sycamore or American plain tree
and we have them--I was

00:23:46.432 --> 00:23:48.850
wondering--we have them around
here;

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:53.342
they're just outside somewhere.
I don't know why they call them

00:23:53.342 --> 00:23:55.697
buttonwoods;
maybe they made buttons out of

00:23:55.697 --> 00:23:56.450
them--of the wood.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.840
The system has gone on now for
well over two hundred years but

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.710
it's changing because of our
technology.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:25.785
It's one of the themes of my
book, New Financial

00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:31.428
Order, as to how much
technology has advanced our

00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:35.660
financial markets and
institutions.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.715
There was some--if you look at
the number of stocks traded on

00:24:39.715 --> 00:24:42.622
the London Stock Exchange,
say, around 1800,

00:24:42.622 --> 00:24:46.431
it was just a handful;
it was just not very big or not

00:24:46.431 --> 00:24:50.009
very important.
But, it was certain kinds of

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:55.319
information technology that
really made stock exchanges take

00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:57.265
off.
I'd like to just mention a few

00:24:57.265 --> 00:25:01.140
of them.
One was--we were living in a

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:07.723
very primitive world in 1800.
People were actually using

00:25:07.723 --> 00:25:13.650
feather pens--that's what you
would use at that time;

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.720
also, paper was very expensive
in 1800.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.359
If you bought a newspaper,
if you look at newspapers from

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:25.349
1800, there would be a single
sheet, typically,

00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:28.390
that folded in half--of paper.
Why was that?

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.818
Well, it's because paper was so
expensive, because in 1800 paper

00:25:32.818 --> 00:25:35.630
had to be made out of scraps of
cloth;

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.167
they didn't have wood pulp
paper and they didn't have--it

00:25:38.167 --> 00:25:42.211
had to be made by hand.
You'd have people washing the

00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:48.134
fabric and then laying it on a
screen--all by hand--and then

00:25:48.134 --> 00:25:52.089
rolling it;
so, it was too expensive.

00:25:52.089 --> 00:26:00.368
We got--in the nineteenth
century, we got cheap paper and

00:26:00.368 --> 00:26:09.386
then we got--I mention that I
think it's important for--we got

00:26:09.386 --> 00:26:13.364
carbon paper;
this came in the nineteenth

00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:16.620
century, although there were
some maybe primitive versions.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.631
It allowed you to make copies.
The typewriter--that came in in

00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:25.591
the late nineteenth century,
so you could make records much

00:26:25.591 --> 00:26:30.552
more accurately with--and make
copies and it's important to

00:26:30.552 --> 00:26:34.230
make copies so that they're
backed up.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:39.950
We had printed forms,
although those actually go back

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:45.450
to the--in Holland,
I think, we traced them back to

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.190
maybe the 1700s.
The idea is having a document

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.166
with spaces to fill in numbers
and then you put it in the

00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:54.698
typewriter;
you've got printed up multiple

00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:57.500
copies of this with carbon paper
between them.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.408
You type--it's very accurate;
it makes it possible to do

00:27:01.408 --> 00:27:05.196
business.
We invented filing cabinets in

00:27:05.196 --> 00:27:06.350
the 1890s;

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.960
that's comparatively
recently--it's kind of amazing.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.579
Filing cabinets--we have the
drawers that come out and you

00:27:16.579 --> 00:27:20.617
put file folders in;
it wasn't until the 1890s that

00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:23.432
that came in.
Before that you would take

00:27:23.432 --> 00:27:26.290
documents and tie them up with
ribbons and put them on

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.673
bookshelves.
Well, there may have been other

00:27:28.673 --> 00:27:30.956
systems as well,
but we didn't have the modern

00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:33.336
filing cabinet.
The really important thing was

00:27:33.336 --> 00:27:38.306
electronic technology.
We had the telegraph,

00:27:38.306 --> 00:27:47.280
which came in by Samuel Morse
in--when was that?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.160
1840s?
I think I might have it.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:59.127
Samuel Morse graduated from
Yale University in 1810 and he

00:27:59.127 --> 00:28:06.059
patented the telegraph in 1837;
so it was 1837.

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:09.849
I'll mention--there's also a
college here.

00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:12.770
Are you, anyone from Morse
College?

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.785
Yes?
Only one, nobody else from

00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:18.650
Morse?
There's a good number.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.881
He did something very important.
Incidentally,

00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:30.522
he lived--his house is 58
Trumbull, which is three blocks

00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:37.636
from here and if you want to,
you can walk over there and see

00:28:37.636 --> 00:28:41.608
Morse's house.
He used to have inventions

00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:45.640
parked out on his front lawn,
but they're not there anymore;

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.471
they've taken them in.
This was a very important

00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:53.952
invention because electronic
communication instantly--or at

00:28:53.952 --> 00:28:57.196
the speed of light
essentially--is what now

00:28:57.196 --> 00:29:02.737
underpins our exchange.
The next thing that happened,

00:29:02.737 --> 00:29:08.211
and that's a little bit later
in the technology,

00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:14.417
was the ticker machine.
It's not entirely clear who

00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:20.889
invented it but--because there
are various versions--but

00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:26.420
apparently it was invented by
Thomas Edison.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:35.640
This was--he was--this was his
first invention.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.569
You've heard of many inventions
from Thomas Edison.

00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:44.112
Quite remarkable that his first
invention was in the area of

00:29:44.112 --> 00:29:49.448
finance and that was in 1867.
How old do you think he was

00:29:49.448 --> 00:29:52.050
when he invented the ticker
machine?

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.824
He was twenty-three;
so that's just a--those of you

00:29:55.824 --> 00:29:59.454
who are thinking of your
careers, some people get started

00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:03.835
at a good, young age.
You probably don't even know

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:08.229
what a ticker machine is.
Do you know what I'm talking

00:30:08.229 --> 00:30:11.799
about, a ticker machine?
Some of you do anyway.

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:16.870
What it was was like a computer
printer.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.336
I mean.
he was just like way ahead of

00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:21.447
his time.
We have these printers--you

00:30:21.447 --> 00:30:24.842
have one in your room or
somewhere--that when electronic

00:30:24.842 --> 00:30:27.930
signals come to it,
it prints out on the paper;

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:35.543
well, he invented one in 1867.
What it did--remember the

00:30:35.543 --> 00:30:41.840
telegraph machine that Morse
invented was--it required humans

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.117
on both ends.
One person would be tapping on

00:30:45.117 --> 00:30:48.207
the Morse Code on one end and
there would be another person

00:30:48.207 --> 00:30:51.509
listening on the other end who
would transcribe it by hand.

00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:54.606
So, Edison thought,
well there's no reason why it

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:58.089
shouldn't be done mechanically
at the receiving end,

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:02.787
so he invented a sort of
automatic typewriter that

00:31:02.787 --> 00:31:06.378
printed out.
The initial application of it

00:31:06.378 --> 00:31:10.177
was to stocks because that
was--that's the kind of

00:31:10.177 --> 00:31:14.519
information people needed
continually on a big basis.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:19.789
He invented this printer and
it's a little different from

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:23.930
modern--we have a standard paper
size now,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.220
which is 8.5" x 11",
but he didn't want to use all

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.053
that.
Remember, paper was more

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.665
expensive then and he didn't
need to get a lot,

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:34.512
so he changed the shape of it.
So, the paper,

00:31:34.512 --> 00:31:38.470
instead of being that wide,
was like that wide because all

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.637
he had to put was symbols for
stocks--abbreviations for their

00:31:42.637 --> 00:31:46.109
names--and then the price at
which it traded.

00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:49.859
He wanted to get a lot of these
in rapid succession out,

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:53.680
so he didn't need a wide width.
It's all very logical.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.990
It was basically a computer
printer with a narrow width.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.630
I forgot to bring it today;
I should have.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.726
I was telling someone at the
New York Stock Exchange that I

00:32:02.726 --> 00:32:05.929
was telling my students about
the ticker machine and students

00:32:05.929 --> 00:32:09.240
didn't--my students didn't seem
to know anything about it.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.539
Then he sent me as a gift a
ticker tape;

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:14.890
it was just a roll of paper
tape.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.089
They were using ticker tapes at
the New York Stock Exchange

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:22.125
until 1964, I think it was,
and he said,

00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:26.800
well we still have some in the
attic and he gave me a roll.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.961
Maybe I'll try to bring it.
This is just,

00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:34.519
maybe, a curious history about
communications.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:37.400
Do you know what a ticker tape
parade is?

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:46.698
Some of you--these ticker
machines used to be printing out

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:52.706
stock prices constantly,
so this tape was just

00:32:52.706 --> 00:32:57.752
constantly running and it would
pile up in these huge wads of

00:32:57.752 --> 00:33:00.756
paper tape.
They had to always dispose of

00:33:00.756 --> 00:33:04.786
it at the brokerages because all
this paper tape had to be thrown

00:33:04.786 --> 00:33:07.180
away and it was a disposal
problem.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.491
Whenever there was a parade
down Wall Street,

00:33:09.491 --> 00:33:12.538
people would--they would use
this ticker tape like confetti

00:33:12.538 --> 00:33:15.690
and they would tear it up into
shorter lengths and they would

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.789
toss it out the windows and so
you'd see all this paper tape

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:22.808
coming down.
We still--this is all obsolete

00:33:22.808 --> 00:33:27.656
now, but in a sense it is
electronic communication

00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:33.890
technology that--I guess we're
still wasting a lot of paper;

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.190
we just changed the width,
so we don't call it tape

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.677
anymore.
We call it printer paper or

00:33:39.677 --> 00:33:43.130
something like that,
so it's not exactly the same.

00:33:55.569 --> 00:34:02.099
The idea that we should have
one market--when we have ticker

00:34:02.099 --> 00:34:09.071
tape machines--we still use the
word ticker symbol for the short

00:34:09.071 --> 00:34:15.066
abbreviation of a stock,
so every stock has an

00:34:15.066 --> 00:34:19.067
abbreviated name.
We don't need abbreviations

00:34:19.067 --> 00:34:21.989
anymore because our printers are
much more effective,

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:26.109
but we still have them.
That's the official--the ticker

00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:31.515
symbol is the official name for
a stock or other security that's

00:34:31.515 --> 00:34:36.607
traded on an exchange.
When you have electronic

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:41.641
communication,
it should create a national

00:34:41.641 --> 00:34:49.010
market that is--where everyone
is getting the same price.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:53.599
However, it doesn't necessarily
work automatically.

00:34:53.599 --> 00:35:01.498
In 1975, people made a number
of complaints to our lawmakers

00:35:01.498 --> 00:35:06.251
in Washington that,
in fact, while we have ticker

00:35:06.251 --> 00:35:09.329
machines and we have a lot
of--well actually,

00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:12.130
they were already gone by
â€˜75, but there were a lot

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.175
of electronic communications.
But, some people were not

00:35:15.175 --> 00:35:18.058
always getting the same price.
Someone would say,

00:35:18.058 --> 00:35:21.200
I placed my order in the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange and

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.346
I got a bad price.
I realized later I could have

00:35:24.346 --> 00:35:27.837
traded at some other
exchange--nobody told me--at the

00:35:27.837 --> 00:35:32.217
same time.
So, Congress created--it was

00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:37.853
The Securities Act of
1975--wanted to create a

00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:41.110
national market system.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.098
So, Congress mandated that
securities brokers set up some

00:35:52.098 --> 00:35:56.263
kind of electronic system that
would allow people to trade on

00:35:56.263 --> 00:35:59.179
whichever exchange has the best
price.

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:02.798
It was sort of a challenge to
the monopoly of the New York

00:36:02.798 --> 00:36:06.353
Stock Exchange because your
broker--if you place an order

00:36:06.353 --> 00:36:10.480
with your broker this--we would
have a new electronic system.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.226
The broker would look over all
the different exchanges and see

00:36:14.226 --> 00:36:17.844
which one had the best price;
that's what you want as a

00:36:17.844 --> 00:36:21.234
customer.
It was implemented with

00:36:21.234 --> 00:36:26.409
something called the
ITS--Intermarket Trading

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:33.700
System--which allows a broker to
look over all the exchanges to

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.702
find the best price.
That was set up with computers

00:36:38.702 --> 00:36:42.070
in 19--or in the early
'70s--1975 or shortly after

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:50.039
1975.
It's been in place ever since;

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:53.921
however, because it was
mandated by Congress,

00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:58.949
the computer system was up to
date and modern in the early

00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:04.429
'70s or late '70s,
but it hasn't kept up and it's

00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:08.914
considered slow,
as a sort of dinosaur,

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:13.869
and people want to avoid
trading in it.

00:37:13.869 --> 00:37:21.521
In 2006, all the major
exchanges proposed that we

00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:29.809
replace the ITS with something
called NMS linkage,

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:35.980
which is just a more modern
version of the computer

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:42.645
technology, but I haven't heard
anything about it being

00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:46.017
implemented.
Again, since I don't

00:37:46.017 --> 00:37:50.281
trade--maybe some of you know
what's happened with NMS linkage

00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:54.141
system.
Let me put this--NMS linkage

00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:59.110
was proposed,
but you see what's happening.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.571
[The NMS Linkage plan was
activated and replaced the ITS

00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:01.660
in June 2007]
When the government tries to

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.492
mandate a linking of exchanges,
that's not the same thing as

00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:07.889
having a market impetus for
linking of exchanges,

00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:14.418
so what's actually happened is
really ignoring the national

00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:18.132
market system.
Computer technology has

00:38:18.132 --> 00:38:23.371
advanced so rapidly it starts to
create opportunities for people

00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:28.361
to set up their own competing
systems and who cares about the

00:38:28.361 --> 00:38:30.869
ITS,
which is a dinosaur,

00:38:30.869 --> 00:38:34.399
which nobody likes.
That's something we have to

00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:38.003
recognize--that there are
different approaches and there

00:38:38.003 --> 00:38:42.001
are going to be clever people
who come up with new ideas about

00:38:42.001 --> 00:38:49.454
how to trade stocks.
This brings us to the so called

00:38:49.454 --> 00:38:55.115
ECNs.
They were called electronic

00:38:55.115 --> 00:39:05.698
communications networks and what
happened was with the advent of

00:39:05.698 --> 00:39:13.458
the Internet--in the mid-1990s,
people started setting up

00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:18.048
websites that looked like stock
exchanges, but maybe they

00:39:18.048 --> 00:39:18.950
weren't.

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:30.801
I guess the first one was
Instinet--I'm not sure it's the

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:35.619
absolute first one,
but Instinet was--now,

00:39:35.619 --> 00:39:42.210
understand that an exchange has
to register with the SEC.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.175
The SEC has all kinds of
requirements,

00:39:44.175 --> 00:39:47.150
and if you're setting up some
website, you probably can't

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.602
satisfy all those requirements.
So, Instinet set up an

00:39:50.602 --> 00:39:53.354
electronic bulletin board,
I called it,

00:39:53.354 --> 00:39:57.409
which was not an exchange but
it was a place where people

00:39:57.409 --> 00:40:01.391
interested in buying and selling
shares could post their

00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:04.964
interest.
It was like an electronic

00:40:04.964 --> 00:40:08.826
bulletin board,
so it would be especially

00:40:08.826 --> 00:40:13.944
important for people who are
placing really big orders

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:19.834
because they might want to not
just put it on the floor of the

00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:24.542
exchange.
But to--they might want to say

00:40:24.542 --> 00:40:30.550
something on the thing about
under what conditions I would

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:36.012
buy this or something like that.
It became more flexible and

00:40:36.012 --> 00:40:39.230
became very popular among
institutional traders.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:45.359
Then there was a number of
other--now the SEC allowed them

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:50.628
to function as ECNs,
which is a separate category,

00:40:50.628 --> 00:40:55.360
and they started to look like
exchanges.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.610
I guess the legal history of
these is very complicated.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.369
They ended up merging with
exchanges;

00:41:01.369 --> 00:41:07.380
this is in the 1990s and early
2000s.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.730
I remember one that impressed
me because I had heard in the

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:19.134
'90s a talk from the founder;
Island was an exchange that was

00:41:19.134 --> 00:41:26.679
created--can you see this?--that
was created for small investors.

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:31.340
It actually started to look a
lot like an exchange.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.429
What I found interesting about
Island--the person I heard speak

00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:40.534
about it in the '90s spoke of
this as democratizing

00:41:40.534 --> 00:41:43.783
institutions.
It was the Web culture taking

00:41:43.783 --> 00:41:46.340
over what the stock exchanges
had done.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:53.613
What Island did was it posted
its limited, so called,

00:41:53.613 --> 00:42:01.865
"order book" on the Web to the
whole world to see and it was

00:42:01.865 --> 00:42:07.460
kind of challenging stock
exchanges,

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.280
which had kept the order books
more or less in secrecy.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.888
Let me just step back and let's
go back to what happens on an

00:42:16.888 --> 00:42:20.960
exchange and how Instinet and
Island are different.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.426
There was another one--another
big one was called

00:42:23.426 --> 00:42:25.429
Archipelago--that sounds like
Island.

00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:30.134
It was another website that you
used to be able to get on and

00:42:30.134 --> 00:42:34.759
you could read these order books
for any stock and you'd see

00:42:34.759 --> 00:42:38.679
some--let's step back and talk
about what's goes on

00:42:38.679 --> 00:42:43.462
traditionally at the New York
Stock Exchange and still goes on

00:42:43.462 --> 00:42:47.138
today.
The New York Stock Exchange is

00:42:47.138 --> 00:42:52.295
the biggest stock exchange in
the U.S., but also in some ways

00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:56.929
the most-old fashioned.
They still have a floor,

00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:02.255
a trading floor.
Most stock exchanges have

00:43:02.255 --> 00:43:08.540
abolished their trading floor.
I just gave a talk in Moscow at

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.776
their stock exchange and I was
mentioning something about

00:43:11.776 --> 00:43:15.011
trading floors and someone
raised his had in the audience

00:43:15.011 --> 00:43:17.387
and says,
you're talking at the Russian

00:43:17.387 --> 00:43:20.650
Stock Exchange trading floor;
that's where my talk was.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.031
I didn't even know I was in it.
I was in the German Frankfurt

00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:30.607
Stock Exchange and I was--they
said, I'll show you our trading

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:33.263
floor.
So, I walk in and I just see a

00:43:33.263 --> 00:43:36.930
bunch of school children and
they had--there was nobody there

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.019
except school children.
It had turned into a museum.

00:43:40.019 --> 00:43:41.956
That's what's happening all
over the world because

00:43:41.956 --> 00:43:45.088
everything is going electronic.
The New York Stock Exchange,

00:43:45.088 --> 00:43:49.138
and the Toronto Stock Exchange,
and the American Stock Exchange

00:43:49.138 --> 00:43:51.619
are the few--or is it the
Montreal,

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:54.008
I forget now--anyway,
there are very few that still

00:43:54.008 --> 00:43:55.277
do it this way.
[The Toronto Stock Exchange

00:43:55.277 --> 00:43:56.192
replaced its trading floor with
an electronic system in

00:43:56.192 --> 00:43:57.242
1997--the Montreal Exchange has
also augmented its trading with

00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:57.869
its SOLA platform introduced in
2005.]

00:43:57.869 --> 00:43:58.920
We still have a floor [at the
New York Stock Exchange].

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.826
So, you have,
for each stock,

00:44:02.826 --> 00:44:10.778
you have a specialist who
stands at a post on the floor of

00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:15.840
the exchange;
so each stock has a specialist.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:22.612
Then you have traders who roam
around the floor and go

00:44:22.612 --> 00:44:30.535
to--these are brokers or dealers
who are trying to buy and sell

00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:37.308
stocks and they go to the
various posts and make their

00:44:37.308 --> 00:44:40.881
rounds.
They have so many stocks they

00:44:40.881 --> 00:44:44.770
want to buy and so many they
want to sell and they go around

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.024
on the floor of the exchange.
If they want to buy a

00:44:48.024 --> 00:44:50.530
particular company,
they go to--they know where

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.710
that specialist is and they go
there.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:58.590
On the floor of the exchange,
they can either buy and sell

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.936
from the specialist,
who is a dealer,

00:45:01.936 --> 00:45:05.703
who maintains an inventory,
or they can buy and sell from

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:08.260
anybody else they meet at the
post.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.550
Of course, everyone there is
licensed;

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.195
it's not open to the public.
What happens is,

00:45:14.195 --> 00:45:21.222
there is a crowd that develops
at each specialist's post and

00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:27.535
the crowd consists of people who
decided to go to that

00:45:27.535 --> 00:45:34.443
specialist's post to look at
what they want to possibly buy

00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:37.775
or sell.
They can buy or sell from

00:45:37.775 --> 00:45:39.782
anyone.
The specialist is sometimes

00:45:39.782 --> 00:45:42.750
just standing there watching and
it's all happening.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.727
The specialist--and the New
York Stock Exchange

00:45:45.727 --> 00:45:49.676
maintains--that the specialist
fulfills an important function,

00:45:49.676 --> 00:45:52.329
which is to create an orderly
market;

00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:56.686
so, the specialist has a
responsibility as well as an

00:45:56.686 --> 00:45:59.709
opportunity.
The other people at the crowd

00:45:59.709 --> 00:46:03.216
are just doing their own
business, but the specialist is

00:46:03.216 --> 00:46:06.659
supposed to be obligated to
preserve a good market.

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:11.125
If for some reason the price is
dropping rapidly and the

00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:14.210
specialist thinks something's
wrong,

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:18.495
the specialist is supposed to
come in and buy on his or her

00:46:18.495 --> 00:46:21.740
own account;
that's an obligation.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:30.447
There have been problems.
For example,

00:46:30.447 --> 00:46:33.513
in 1987, when the stock market
dropped precipitously,

00:46:33.513 --> 00:46:36.874
there were criticisms of the
specialists for not buying to

00:46:36.874 --> 00:46:39.805
support the market.
But then, specialists said in

00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:41.740
their own defense,
what could we do?

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.734
The market is crashing.
So, it's not clear that

00:46:44.734 --> 00:46:48.430
specialists make a huge
difference, but that's the

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:53.645
presumed advantage.
Now it used to be--this is an

00:46:53.645 --> 00:46:59.776
interesting historical
thing--that before the 1930s

00:46:59.776 --> 00:47:05.539
there were two crowds on the
stock exchange.

00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:10.893
There was the buy/sell crowd
and there was another part of

00:47:10.893 --> 00:47:16.716
the floor--I can't find this in
my notes--where stocks would be

00:47:16.716 --> 00:47:20.486
rented.
I had the dates here and I

00:47:20.486 --> 00:47:22.800
don't remember.
I can't find it in my notes.

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.385
[Charles Jones and Owen Lamont
report in their study of the

00:47:28.385 --> 00:47:29.357
loan crowd that data on their
trades was published in the

00:47:29.357 --> 00:47:30.137
Wall Street Journal from
1919 to 1933.]

00:47:30.137 --> 00:47:32.526
Well anyway,
shares are--it's called the

00:47:32.526 --> 00:47:33.450
loan crowd.

00:47:39.329 --> 00:47:43.115
There used to be a special part
of the floor of the New York

00:47:43.115 --> 00:47:47.030
Stock Exchange where stocks
would be lent rather than sold.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.840
There are two things you can do;
there are two kinds of trade.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.961
You go to a real estate
broker--you can say,

00:47:51.961 --> 00:47:55.070
I want to buy a house or you
can say, I want to rent a house.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.550
The broker can do both of those
for you.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.707
Same thing with stocks--you can
say, I want to buy a stock or

00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:04.340
you can say, I want to rent a
stock.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.909
Or you can go the other way--I
want to sell a stock and I'd

00:48:06.909 --> 00:48:09.789
like to rent out my stock.
Why would anyone want to rent a

00:48:09.789 --> 00:48:14.909
stock?
Well, that's called short sales.

00:48:14.909 --> 00:48:17.010
They would rent a stock and
sell it.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:23.089
It used to be that--of course,
if you're lending out a stock,

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:27.750
you might demand some
compensation for that.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:32.438
They used to argue--there would
be a specialist crowd called

00:48:32.438 --> 00:48:37.048
the--there would be a loan crowd
that would argue about the

00:48:37.048 --> 00:48:40.315
rental cost,
which is an interest cost for

00:48:40.315 --> 00:48:43.756
borrowing a security.
The Wall Street Journal

00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:46.840
used to publish--there were two
stock sections;

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.369
there was the price section and
there was the loan section.

00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:56.719
That, however,
disappeared after the stock

00:48:56.719 --> 00:49:02.277
market crash of 1929.
Apparently, it disappeared

00:49:02.277 --> 00:49:08.574
because of concern that shorting
stocks was the cause of the 1929

00:49:08.574 --> 00:49:10.934
crash.
The story was that J.

00:49:10.934 --> 00:49:13.743
Edgar Hoover,
who was head of the F.B.I.,

00:49:13.743 --> 00:49:17.605
thought that shorting stocks
had caused the Crash and he

00:49:17.605 --> 00:49:19.362
didn't like it.
If J.

00:49:19.362 --> 00:49:23.166
Edgar Hoover didn't like what
you were doing back then,

00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:26.526
you were afraid and worried.
So, the New York Stock

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:28.451
Exchange, without ever
publishing it,

00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:30.911
just shut the whole thing down
and to this day,

00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:33.050
we don't have a loan crowd
anymore.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:37.987
We do still lend out shares,
but it's not done on the floor

00:49:37.987 --> 00:49:42.241
of the exchange.
Anyway, the specialist at the

00:49:42.241 --> 00:49:47.966
floor of the exchange has a book
and it used to be a big thick

00:49:47.966 --> 00:49:53.134
paper book.
What the specialist would

00:49:53.134 --> 00:50:02.846
do--the specialist would record
in the book offers and bids--bid

00:50:02.846 --> 00:50:08.885
and asked prices.
There would be people who would

00:50:08.885 --> 00:50:14.891
tell the specialist that I want
to sell so many shares at such a

00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:20.707
price or buy so many shares at
such a price and the book would

00:50:20.707 --> 00:50:25.570
show the list of orders that
were outstanding.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:32.530
Now, this comes back to--I
should clarify kinds of orders.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.981
When you call up a broker and
say, I would like to buy or sell

00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:45.995
shares, there's different--you
can give--you're giving your

00:50:45.995 --> 00:50:49.508
broker an order.
You can give the broker a

00:50:49.508 --> 00:50:50.700
market order.

00:50:54.889 --> 00:50:58.112
If you give a market order to
your broker, you're saying you

00:50:58.112 --> 00:51:01.389
only have to give the broker one
number, which is a number of

00:51:01.389 --> 00:51:04.584
shares.
So, I can have a buy order or a

00:51:04.584 --> 00:51:08.115
sell order--market order.
If it's a buy order,

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:10.894
all I do is say,
I want you to buy for me,

00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:15.164
let's say, 1,000 shares of this
company at whatever price is out

00:51:15.164 --> 00:51:18.191
there;
just get the best price you

00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:24.469
can, but execute it right now.
It only gives a number of

00:51:24.469 --> 00:51:25.640
shares.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.300
Another kind of order,
however, is a limit order.

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:41.700
With this order you have to
tell the broker both the number

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:48.060
of shares and the price.
There's either a buy or a sell,

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:53.127
so if it's a buy limit order,
you want to say,

00:51:53.127 --> 00:51:59.320
I want you to buy the stock at
any price up to the one I

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.953
mentioned.
So, I would give--I would say,

00:52:03.953 --> 00:52:09.840
1,000 shares at $30 a share and
that means that if it's a buy

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.630
order, you wait until--you don't
execute it immediately.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:20.659
You execute it when the price
falls below $30.

00:52:20.659 --> 00:52:24.371
A person would do this who
thinks, I think the stock is a

00:52:24.371 --> 00:52:27.420
good buy at $30,
but not where it's trading now

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.094
at $35.
So, I just put--and just tell

00:52:30.094 --> 00:52:33.917
my broker, I want you to take
this limit order and I don't

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:37.788
expect you to fill this order.
Maybe you'll never fill it,

00:52:37.788 --> 00:52:40.920
but I just want it to be there
until I correct it.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.878
You're just supposed to be
standing ready and you're

00:52:43.878 --> 00:52:47.184
supposed to notice when the
price falls below $30 and then

00:52:47.184 --> 00:52:49.905
you buy.
If it was a sell limit order

00:52:49.905 --> 00:52:52.943
you would say,
I want you to sell it if the

00:52:52.943 --> 00:52:56.656
price gets up to $40.
Again, if it's above the

00:52:56.656 --> 00:53:00.610
current market price,
it won't be executed now;

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:05.344
it might never be executed.
Then there's another kind of

00:53:05.344 --> 00:53:09.120
order called a stop-loss order.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.508
With a stop-loss order,
like a limit order,

00:53:16.508 --> 00:53:19.469
you have to both give a
quantity and a price to your

00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:23.866
broker when you place the order.
It's similar to a--it's in a

00:53:23.866 --> 00:53:28.561
different--a stop--a sell--you
could have the same numbers

00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.916
here;
you could say 1,000 and $30

00:53:31.916 --> 00:53:36.510
again, but it would have a
different meaning.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:42.760
A stop-loss order says to sell
when the price hits $30.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.116
In this case,
if it were a stop loss order

00:53:47.116 --> 00:53:53.704
for 1,000 shares at $30 it would
be to sell--if the price today

00:53:53.704 --> 00:53:56.679
is $35--not buy.
It's a different

00:53:56.679 --> 00:53:59.280
motivation--that you would do a
stop-loss order.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.345
You see the difference?
If it's a limit order,

00:54:02.345 --> 00:54:05.760
I'm saying I think the stock is
only worth $30;

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.909
I want to buy it when it gets
down to $30.

00:54:07.909 --> 00:54:11.427
With a stop-loss order,
if the actual price today is

00:54:11.427 --> 00:54:15.022
$35 a share, I'm saying,
I'm worried about the stock

00:54:15.022 --> 00:54:18.025
crashing on me,
so I want you to get me out if

00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:20.702
it's crashing.
The broker has to know,

00:54:20.702 --> 00:54:24.752
well when do I get you out?
Well, you have to say when,

00:54:24.752 --> 00:54:27.603
so this is when.
So, you'd be telling,

00:54:27.603 --> 00:54:30.853
if it's a sell order,
you would be telling your

00:54:30.853 --> 00:54:34.739
broker, sell the stock if the
price falls below $30.

00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:37.341
There's a fundamental
difference between a limit order

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:40.369
and a stop-loss order.
There's also a buy-stop order.

00:54:40.369 --> 00:54:45.131
You could tell your broker,
I want you to buy the stock if

00:54:45.131 --> 00:54:50.260
the price rises above $40.
Now, why would someone do that?

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.317
Why would you tell--have an
order to buy the stock only if

00:54:53.317 --> 00:54:56.269
it gets expensive?
Well, the people who would do

00:54:56.269 --> 00:54:59.119
that are people who have shorted
the stock.

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:02.263
If you've shorted the stock and
the stock price starts going up,

00:55:02.263 --> 00:55:04.059
you're potentially in big
trouble.

00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:07.533
So, if you worry about that,
then you can say a buy-stop

00:55:07.533 --> 00:55:10.059
order and place that with your
broker.

00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:17.522
What Island did--I'm going back
to--the brokers used to have all

00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:21.340
these orders--well,
the market orders wouldn't end

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.513
up on their book because it
would just be executed

00:55:23.513 --> 00:55:25.110
immediately and it would be
gone.

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:29.148
These limit orders and
stop-loss orders would be on the

00:55:29.148 --> 00:55:33.111
book of the broker and the
broker would then know--the

00:55:33.111 --> 00:55:37.000
specialist at the exchange would
have this book,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.230
which recorded customers'
orders.

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:44.335
So, the specialist would
understand the market because it

00:55:44.335 --> 00:55:48.440
would have a whole bunch of
these orders on the books.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:55.750
The nice thing about Island,
when it became part of our Web

00:55:55.750 --> 00:56:02.867
culture in the 1970s,
is they created their own book

00:56:02.867 --> 00:56:10.598
on the Web, so you could
get--you could actually--it was

00:56:10.598 --> 00:56:17.818
open to everyone.
You'd have the--you would have

00:56:17.818 --> 00:56:26.193
buy orders and sell orders and
this would be something you

00:56:26.193 --> 00:56:31.250
could see on the Web.
Actually, you can see things

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.639
like this on the Web now too,
but not through Island anymore.

00:56:34.639 --> 00:56:40.567
Let's say this is some company,
let's say it's IBM,

00:56:40.567 --> 00:56:45.309
and you would see something
like this.

00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:50.691
It would be--the buy orders
would--it would be--the first

00:56:50.691 --> 00:56:54.920
one would say for $90 a share,
100 shares.

00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:02.391
Someone's willing to buy 100
shares at $90 and over here you

00:57:02.391 --> 00:57:09.230
would see something like,
someone is willing to sell at

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:18.039
$92, let's say 200 shares.
There's no trade here, right?

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:21.888
If somebody is willing to buy
at 90 and someone else is

00:57:21.888 --> 00:57:24.810
willing to buy at $92 there's no
trade.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:30.182
Then you'll see other orders;
somebody else is willing to buy

00:57:30.182 --> 00:57:36.090
at 89 1/2, say 200 shares,
and you see these descending.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:40.960
I'm just making up numbers--$88
for 1,000 shares and so on.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.168
On sell, we then see other
people, someone who's going at

00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:52.255
92 1/4 for 300 shares.
I'm showing all the purchases

00:57:52.255 --> 00:57:55.010
in round lots;
a round lot is 100 shares.

00:57:55.010 --> 00:58:00.485
You could also have odd lots,
but most of the time people put

00:58:00.485 --> 00:58:06.780
round lots on as a trade.
This book would then sit there;

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.980
there's no trade here.
This is the inside spread.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:18.375
That is the--on the limit order
book, those are the trades that

00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:23.635
are closest to execution,
but it's not an executable

00:58:23.635 --> 00:58:27.546
trade yet.
What would happen then--and it

00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:31.657
was as you would watch the
book--and since it's now

00:58:31.657 --> 00:58:35.110
electronic, it corrects itself
quickly.

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.401
I don't know what the
specialist had to do with a

00:58:37.401 --> 00:58:39.894
feather pen.
Originally, they would have to

00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:43.604
cross these things out with ink
and the book was probably hard

00:58:43.604 --> 00:58:46.219
to maintain, but now it's all
automatic.

00:58:46.219 --> 00:58:51.440
Suppose someone comes in with a
buy order for 100 at 90 and a

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.313
sell order for 100 at 90,
so someone's willing to sell at

00:58:56.313 --> 00:59:01.217
a lower price.
What happens immediately on

00:59:01.217 --> 00:59:07.151
this--this thing becomes
executed and disappears,

00:59:07.151 --> 00:59:12.219
so you see that happening on
the book.

00:59:12.219 --> 00:59:15.739
It's fun to watch an electronic
book.

00:59:15.739 --> 00:59:21.305
This is what brokers see who
are members of NASDAQ and they

00:59:21.305 --> 00:59:24.760
see the electronic trading
system.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:31.450
Of course, there are many such
books now that are available.

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:42.008
The dealer--the specialist on
the exchange also has his

00:59:42.008 --> 00:59:46.228
own--his or her own--bid-asked
spread, which is also an offer

00:59:46.228 --> 00:59:49.594
to buy or sell on the exchange.
Incidentally,

00:59:49.594 --> 00:59:52.448
Island would only allow one
kind of order,

00:59:52.448 --> 00:59:55.503
at least originally.
It was only limit orders

00:59:55.503 --> 00:59:59.196
because they didn't--they had a
system where you had to put it

00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:02.829
onto their book and everything
had to appear on the book,

01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:06.210
so it was just a limit order
book originally.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:12.573
The history of this--I guess
one thing I wanted to--what I

01:00:12.573 --> 01:00:18.489
was leading up to is that the
ECNs are history now.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:21.070
They've been generally merged
and acquired.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.337
Notably, the New York Stock
Exchange, which has been the

01:00:24.337 --> 01:00:28.390
holdout doing floor trading,
bought Archipelago because

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:33.629
Archipelago was growing so fast
doing this kind of electronic

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:36.550
trading;
it was really catching on.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:41.575
New York Stock Exchange began
to worry that it was starting to

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:45.124
get behind the times.
The New York Stock--these

01:00:45.124 --> 01:00:49.095
things, which were started by
kids--young college students in

01:00:49.095 --> 01:00:53.198
the late â€˜90s--just grew
so fast and they got so big that

01:00:53.198 --> 01:00:57.367
Archipelago was starting to look
like it was going to get bigger

01:00:57.367 --> 01:01:01.458
than New York Stock Exchange.
So, finally New York Stock

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:05.400
Exchange merged with them and
they changed the name after 200

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.525
years in business.
They changed the name to NYSE

01:01:09.525 --> 01:01:14.070
Archa--Archa is short for
Archipelago Exchange.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.539
That didn't last long;
they changed their name again.

01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:21.804
They just merged--New York
Stock Exchange merged with the

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:25.536
European Stock Exchange,
Euronext, and so now it's

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:29.973
called NYSE Euronext.
Everything happened so fast and

01:01:29.973 --> 01:01:34.751
it seems fast to me.
The New York Stock Exchange is

01:01:34.751 --> 01:01:39.241
in the process,
we think, of merging with the

01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:45.159
American Stock Exchange and
that's happening right now.

01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:47.486
[NYSE Euronext announced on
January 17,2008 a "definitive

01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:49.978
agreement" to acquire the AMEX.]
I wanted to just finish with

01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:52.346
just a little bit of a thought
about what it means to be a

01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:56.610
dealer in this market.
What is it that if you are a

01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:03.032
dealer operating on one of these
exchanges, you are placing

01:02:03.032 --> 01:02:05.756
orders,
effectively,

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:13.030
in somebody's book and standing
ready to buy or sell.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:18.302
A dealer is someone who is
trading everyday,

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:23.820
who has an inventory of stocks
for trading.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.934
I want to just maybe close with
a little thought about what it's

01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:33.519
like to be a dealer.
I've never been a dealer and I

01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:39.024
don't know the emotional thing,
but the problem with being a

01:02:39.024 --> 01:02:44.809
dealer of any kind--maybe it
takes a certain moral stamina,

01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:47.238
mental stamina,
to do this kind of thing--is

01:02:47.238 --> 01:02:50.837
that you're trading everyday.
You're not someone who's

01:02:50.837 --> 01:02:55.074
managing the Yale portfolio.
What you're trying to do is

01:02:55.074 --> 01:02:59.305
make money everyday by buying
low and selling high and you

01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:03.908
have to be ready to stand--ready
to take orders--because people

01:03:03.908 --> 01:03:06.942
come to you.
Someone will come to you or

01:03:06.942 --> 01:03:10.685
there will be someone in a
specialist's crowd who wants to

01:03:10.685 --> 01:03:14.559
place an order or buy or sell
and you have an inventory.

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:21.533
You're like an antiques dealer
and one problem is that your

01:03:21.533 --> 01:03:27.171
life's work, unfortunately,
as a dealer is summarized by

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:29.860
your portfolio and your
inventory.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.579
That's why I didn't become a
dealer, actually.

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:38.775
I don't--I guess you have to
have the right stomach of steel

01:03:38.775 --> 01:03:41.961
or something.
The thing that I wanted to

01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:45.059
impress on you is that no matter
how well you do,

01:03:45.059 --> 01:03:49.241
your cumulative score is there
in your portfolio and it's a

01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:53.355
competitive business.
So, you run the risk of being

01:03:53.355 --> 01:03:58.638
ruined at any time in your life.
This just--I want to remind you

01:03:58.638 --> 01:04:03.295
of what's called the gambler's
ruin problem because being a

01:04:03.295 --> 01:04:07.791
dealer is a little bit like
being someone who goes to the

01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:12.119
gambling casino everyday.
If you enjoy your visit to the

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:15.190
gambling casino,
maybe you want to be a dealer.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:18.207
Actually, I don't really enjoy
it, so I'm just not the right

01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:20.967
person to do this.
What I really wouldn't like

01:04:20.967 --> 01:04:24.314
about it is that you always
stand the chance of being

01:04:24.314 --> 01:04:26.760
ruined--that is,
losing everything.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.845
So, I just want to review.
This is a little bit of

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:33.800
mathematics that is in market
microstructure theory.

01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:49.017
Suppose you're a dealer and you
have a way of either winning or

01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:51.630
losing money on each
transaction.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:59.612
Suppose the probability of
winning on a transaction is

01:04:59.612 --> 01:05:08.800
equal to p--that's the
probability of winning on one of

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.794
your trades.
To simplify this thing,

01:05:12.794 --> 01:05:15.480
let's say that you either win
or lose.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:24.860
If you win, you get $1;
if you lose, you lose $1.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:30.722
So, you win $1 with probability
p and you lose $1 with

01:05:30.722 --> 01:05:33.360
probability 1 - p.

01:05:38.849 --> 01:05:42.211
I want to know,
what is your life career going

01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:46.619
to look like if you're just
doing this everyday for the next

01:05:46.619 --> 01:05:50.973
thirty years?
Well, the first question is,

01:05:50.973 --> 01:05:56.039
what is the probability of your
being ruined?

01:05:56.039 --> 01:06:00.004
Let's start with the case
p = ½

01:06:00.004 --> 01:06:05.590
and let's not say--thirty years
is close enough to infinity,

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.759
but let's just say you're going
to do this forever because I

01:06:08.759 --> 01:06:12.090
don't want to have to figure out
the effect of the last day.

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:15.271
What do you think is the
probability of being--remember,

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.510
being ruined means having your
inventory fall to zero.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:25.928
You start with S
dollars--that's capital S

01:06:25.928 --> 01:06:32.593
dollars--which is an integer.
When S falls to zero,

01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:35.850
you are "ruined;"
you don't have any money left;

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:38.545
you're out of the game;
and you will be dismissed from

01:06:38.545 --> 01:06:40.879
the exchange.
If you can't trade anymore,

01:06:40.879 --> 01:06:43.638
you don't have anything.
You have to start with

01:06:43.638 --> 01:06:46.519
something, otherwise you can't
trade at all.

01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:48.949
So, S is something like
$100.

01:06:48.949 --> 01:06:51.809
If p as a point--do any
of you know the answer?

01:06:51.809 --> 01:06:55.680
What's the probability that I
will eventually be ruined?

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.309
This isn't something that you
got in your probability theory?

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:10.269
You got it right--that's right,
it's 100%.

01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:15.110
You will with certainty be
ruined.

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:22.835
In fact, the probability of
ruin is ((1 -

01:07:22.835 --> 01:07:34.229
p)/p)^S,
if p is greater than .5

01:07:34.229 --> 01:07:41.791
or greater than-equal to .5.
That's because,

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:45.292
if you substitute in .5,
this is 1, so,

01:07:45.292 --> 01:07:50.597
the probability of ruin is 1.
If it's--if the probability is

01:07:50.597 --> 01:07:54.056
greater than .5,
then the probability of ruin

01:07:54.056 --> 01:07:59.822
will be something less than 1.
This is actually easy to derive

01:07:59.822 --> 01:08:04.836
because--think of it this
way--we'll call this the

01:08:04.836 --> 01:08:10.260
probability of ruin,
if you have S dollars.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:17.985
The reason it has this is
because if I start with s

01:08:17.985 --> 01:08:22.864
dollars, there are two
possibilities:

01:08:22.864 --> 01:08:30.382
either gain $1 or lose $1.
So, this probability of

01:08:30.382 --> 01:08:39.237
S has to equal p x
Pr(S + 1) + (1 - p )

01:08:39.237 --> 01:08:43.439
x Pr(S â€“
1).

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:48.216
That is the probability--this
is the probability of ruin if

01:08:48.216 --> 01:08:53.156
you have S + $1 and this
is the probability of ruin if

01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:57.131
you have S - $1.
So, the function determining

01:08:57.131 --> 01:09:00.510
probability of S has to
satisfy this equation.

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:04.284
Also, we have the
restraint--the probability of

01:09:04.284 --> 01:09:09.043
ruin if you have zero dollars is
1, so this is a difference

01:09:09.043 --> 01:09:11.960
equation.
If you solve it, you get this.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.773
What it means is that you had
better have a probability of

01:09:17.773 --> 01:09:23.688
winning substantially above $1
or else have an awful lot of

01:09:23.688 --> 01:09:27.333
dollars to start with.
Unfortunately,

01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:30.808
it's hard to get the
probability of winning in any

01:09:30.808 --> 01:09:34.922
one trade much up above ½
because you're living in a

01:09:34.922 --> 01:09:39.886
competitive marketplace.
So, if p is close to

01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:45.159
½, it's just a little bit
above ½,

01:09:45.159 --> 01:09:48.209
then you will be standing for
your whole life,

01:09:48.209 --> 01:09:52.342
always with a probability that
the rest of my life is going to

01:09:52.342 --> 01:09:55.551
end up in ruin.
So, you may have been very

01:09:55.551 --> 01:09:58.729
successful and you now have
S = 1000,

01:09:58.729 --> 01:10:03.460
but the probability keeps going
down, but it never hits zero.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:07.680
Student: A gambler can
take money off the table.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.035
Professor Robert
Shiller: Well,

01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:10.720
that's what you have--that's
what people do.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.372
Student: I think you're
saying that the specialist--the

01:10:14.372 --> 01:10:16.369
first few [inaudible].
Professor Robert

01:10:16.369 --> 01:10:17.634
Shiller: Well,
they are taking money off

01:10:17.634 --> 01:10:18.869
the--maybe because they are
doing that.

01:10:18.869 --> 01:10:23.900
You live your life and you take
money off.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.096
Yeah, you're right;
I don't have to play it out to

01:10:29.096 --> 01:10:33.410
the bitter end like this.
I wanted to show--this is

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:38.649
actually--this mathematical
model is something that you will

01:10:38.649 --> 01:10:43.711
find in the Page 1 or Chapter 1
of a market microstructure

01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:48.570
textbook because you're right;
there are strategies that can

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:52.411
prevent ruin like that.
This is the basic--this is

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:57.469
just--I'm presenting this as a
very simple model of what

01:10:57.469 --> 01:11:01.239
underlies the restriction on a
broker.

01:11:01.239 --> 01:11:06.228
A broker has to
maintain--create a strategy such

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:11.853
that this p is
sufficiently probable--that this

01:11:11.853 --> 01:11:16.630
ruin problem doesn't become
catastrophic.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:20.539
The way they do that,
they set the bid-asked spread

01:11:20.539 --> 01:11:24.291
that a dealer has with
consideration of this ruin

01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:27.053
problem,
which has to be the focal point

01:11:27.053 --> 01:11:30.455
of their attention.
They have to set the bid-asked

01:11:30.455 --> 01:11:34.832
spread wide enough so that they
feel comfortable enough with

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.927
this probability of ruin.
If you don't--of course,

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:43.130
it's a competitive market and
so you can't get this

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:48.078
probability up too high.
So, if you don't like this,

01:11:48.078 --> 01:11:51.689
don't become a dealer;
that's the way it is.

01:11:51.689 --> 01:11:55.307
The people who are in this
business are people who can

01:11:55.307 --> 01:11:59.744
tolerate this prospect of ruin.
On the other hand,

01:11:59.744 --> 01:12:02.917
ruin isn't death;
that's another thing you were

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:05.316
saying.
I can make a living doing this

01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:09.499
for a while and I am taking
money out and that's part of the

01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:12.055
strategy.
Maybe I'm just being too much

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:15.158
of an academic here.
I live in great comfort in

01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:18.250
academia and these beautiful
surroundings.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.560
This university has been around
for 300 years;

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.051
I have no worries.
So, you might want to consider

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:29.979
an academic career instead of a
career in finance.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:35.020
I hope to see you again then on
Friday.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.000
I think we'll have a good time
with Schwarzman.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.958
Prof: Today what I'd
like to do is focus first on de

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.215
Soto,
and then on the larger

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:11.170
question--you have your informal
property back,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.621
Jennifer--and then on the
larger question of what's the

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:17.270
point of all this?
 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.460
What is the merit of capitalism?
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.223
We know a lot of things that
capitalism isn't really great

00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:30.993
at,
and we know that it has--if you

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:36.242
let it run its own course,
it is inclined toward

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:42.641
instability and it is inclined
toward stupendous disruption of

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.110
the planet.
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.990
Yet, I for one,
am a guarded enthusiast for

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.430
capitalism.
 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.530
The underlying point of it must
have something to do with

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.519
helping people to have a fuller
capacity to lead their lives.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.010
You might call it a practical
freedom.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:20.849
The subject for today and for
next Monday bring that out,

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:25.444
that is, today with de Soto and
I'm going to call on several of

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:30.040
you to think about how you would
use 5% of the GDP of a country

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.964
to do as much good as possible,
and then on Monday,

00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:40.760
The White Tiger,
which illustrates,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.684
quite powerfully,
that increasing the average

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:55.989
income or wealth in a country
can be a wonderful thing,

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.950
but seen from the very bottom
cannot be so great.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.361
The protagonist in The White
Tiger is a brilliant

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:09.688
articulator, if you will,
of that problem.

00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:17.432
Okay, so the photograph in
front of you is meant to call

00:02:17.432 --> 00:02:23.908
forth de Soto's idea of
Braudel's bell jar,

00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:31.805
and the foreground,
a vast favela is all

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:37.145
informal property,
and because it's informal

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:43.310
property it is dead capital,
and the background is not only

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.068
live capital and formal
property,

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:52.830
but extremely dense piling up
of live capital.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.810
It is an expression of intense
economic activity and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.729
presumably, for the most part,
of great economic success.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:13.195
De Soto, on pages 160 and 161
has--first of all he has some

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:20.919
typeface there that is small
enough that I can't read it,

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.608
and my guess is,
many of you will struggle to

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:24.220
read it.
 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.054
But at the top of the page he
has a bridge showing his

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:34.709
prescription for the path from
dead capital on the left to live

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.990
capital on the right.
 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.651
Across the top,
the roadway,

00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:43.270
if you will,
is the commercial strategy,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.224
the creation of businesses,
the taking of debt in order to

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:52.150
create new enterprises.
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.913
Then the process by which de
Soto and his disciples first map

00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:06.413
out the problem,
and then engage in a political

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:11.498
and legal strategy to create the
framework for formalized

00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:16.040
property all the way to the
bottom of society,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.124
and then the operational
strategies whereby that is

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:22.714
implemented,
a neighborhood at a time,

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:24.189
a favela at a time.
 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:30.540
De Soto is deadly serious about
this, and it's a practical

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.990
enterprise.
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.697
I'm going to Peru at the end of
term to sit in on an attempt by

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:44.973
de Soto and his fellows to
formalize a set of neighborhoods

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:49.286
around a city,
and I hope to write a business

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:53.798
case that will be used in this
course a year from now on that

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:54.399
trip.
 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:04.550
Now if you take the totality of
de Soto's book,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.137
the only thing worse than
leaving informal property

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:14.002
informal,
from his point of view,

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:20.584
is force fitting a formalized
system invented in a university

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:25.850
onto an existing system of
informal property.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.913
I'd like to talk about that
with you or a few minutes and

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:35.615
give you a case from my own
experience in an American

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:36.699
setting.
 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.091
Well informal property,
these are boundaries in an

00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:48.050
imaginary informal property
system,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.502
which correspond to the
ingrained habits and customs of

00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:55.470
the people who own this
property,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.624
and their inclination will be
always to defend it against

00:06:00.624 --> 00:06:04.490
change imposed arbitrarily from
outside.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.028
If you ask smart professors at
The Yale School of Management,

00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:15.382
what's the most efficient way
to lay out the boundaries of

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:17.829
property,
they'll give you something like

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:21.988
the red grid here,
with right angles and straight

00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:22.759
lines.
 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.024
Right angles and straight lines
have a brilliant history in

00:06:27.024 --> 00:06:28.790
American property law.
 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.949
President Jefferson laid out a
grid like this on all but the

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:39.995
northeast corner of the U.S.,
of longitude and latitude lines

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:45.521
defining sections of 640 acres,
and the whole development of

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.110
the American West is actually
on--

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.170
with the exception of the
mountainous areas,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.009
for example, The Sierra Nevadas.
 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.129
With that exception the whole
country looks like this rec--

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.946
rectalinear grid,
and as you fly from coast to

00:07:03.946 --> 00:07:06.940
coast,
you can see the grid laid out

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.084
in a perfectly symmetrical way,
with center pivot irrigation

00:07:12.084 --> 00:07:15.990
interrupting the grid from time
to time,

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.000
and an occasional river.
 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.569
The better way,
according to de Soto,

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:29.300
is to adapt formal systems to
fit informal systems;

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.410
to incrementally add the
perimeter meets and bounds shown

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.913
here,
and ultimately to convert the

00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:41.259
old boundaries to new
boundaries,

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.896
the old boundaries being
recognized only by people living

00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:49.617
within this little area;
the new boundaries being

00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:53.209
recognized all the way up to the
nation's state level;

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:56.004
and in theory,
all the way up to the world

00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:59.615
level, if people from another
country are engaged in a

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:01.319
property transaction.
 

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:06.110
For example,
if the owner of this land seeks

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:12.574
to take debt from a bank in New
York and the property is in

00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:16.391
Peru,
the whole world system is

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:21.846
involved in the formalization,
and the obligation of the

00:08:21.846 --> 00:08:26.641
Peruvian government to honor a
contract with an American bank

00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:28.560
would come into play.
 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.572
And so even at the very lowest
level, the ultimate chain of

00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:40.898
connections to the top level of
government on a world scale is

00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:42.350
important.
 

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:54.590
Nearly twenty years ago,
a fellow named Kurt Schmoke,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:01.086
Yale class of 1970,
and sometimes senior fellow of

00:09:01.086 --> 00:09:07.870
The Yale Corporation,
was Mayor of Baltimore.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:14.138
I didn't actually have him as a
student here but I was working

00:09:14.138 --> 00:09:18.658
then on cities that had too much
housing,

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:24.509
which I called "under
crowded cities."

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:27.278
You read all the city planning
books from that period,

00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:29.631
it's all about how do we handle
all this new population that has

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:32.779
to be housed,
and of course the real story

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:37.860
for a city like Baltimore,
was a vast housing surplus.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.750
Anybody come from Baltimore?
 

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.193
I'll settle for Washington or
Philadelphia,

00:09:44.193 --> 00:09:47.639
or Wilmington,
what have we got in the back

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:48.460
there?
 

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.820
What city?
 

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.840
Student:  Washington.
 

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.658
Prof: Okay can you--can
you give us a feel for what a

00:09:58.658 --> 00:10:04.669
neighborhood constructed of row
houses looks like?

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:05.808
How it's organized.
 

00:10:05.808 --> 00:10:07.607
Student:  Well I can
tell you about Baltimore because

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.340
I see it on the train.
 

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.909
It looks like all the houses
are boarded up,

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:14.376
all the backyards are trashed,
and there's a lot of vacancy

00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:16.288
and just desolate wasteland.
 

00:10:16.288 --> 00:10:18.057
Prof: Okay,
it's still a mess,

00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:18.450
right?
 

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.340
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.594
Prof: Which means I was
not very effective,

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:25.450
and Mayor Schmoke was not very
effective.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.688
The difficulty with--row houses
are what the economists call an

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:33.298
inferior good.
 

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:37.129
The standard Baltimore row
house is nine feet wide,

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:42.567
the widest are 16 feet wide,
so it's like living in a

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:46.326
railroad car,
or in--if it's a tall one,

00:10:46.326 --> 00:10:50.899
two or three railroad cars
stacked on top of each other.

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:53.873
By and large,
people prefer ranch houses,

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:57.812
which are more--which more
nearly approximate a square

00:10:57.812 --> 00:10:58.629
layout.
 

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:03.706
People also don't like living
around visible signs of decay

00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:06.418
like the ones just described.
 

00:11:06.418 --> 00:11:12.594
When I came on the scene,
this is a very abstract

00:11:12.594 --> 00:11:16.668
representation,
but the green dots

00:11:16.668 --> 00:11:22.528
represent--the squares represent
property units and the green

00:11:22.528 --> 00:11:28.355
dots represent occupied units,
the yellow dots represent units

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.590
that are still standing but
condemned,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:37.124
and the blank units represent
areas where the house has been

00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:38.250
torn down.
 

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.077
There's no precision in what
I'm doing here but it'll show

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:48.668
you the difficulty of trying to
change something for the better.

00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:52.976
I didn't even know de Soto's
work at this time,

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:58.779
but I was acting on the same
general intuitions that he has;

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:04.602
that we're at the edge of the
bell jar--this slide's just in

00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:09.241
the wrong place,
but the red line is the edge of

00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:10.918
the bell jar.
 

00:12:10.918 --> 00:12:18.839
One solution to missing
properties is to install

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:25.147
waterfalls;
this was done as a joke by a

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:28.970
student at Johns Hopkins.
 

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.320
It didn't involve any actual
water or construction;

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.710
it's just a photographic joke.
 

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.615
Another approach,
and it's the one that I

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:46.509
advocated,
is to triage neighborhoods and

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:53.548
to take a neighborhood like this
where you have very few occupied

00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:57.128
units,
most of what's there standing

00:12:57.128 --> 00:13:02.620
is condemned,
and lots of vacant lots.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:11.440
To say let's find a way to use
the wealth of people living here

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:20.830
to improve conditions in a more
promising adjacent neighborhood.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:33.371
The first thought is that you
take down the condemned houses

00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:41.876
in the unworkable area,
and at the same time,

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:49.250
you offer swaps where you buy
for what it's worth,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.269
which is not a lot,
you buy houses in the

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:57.248
unworkable area from people,
and part of their payment is

00:13:57.248 --> 00:14:02.902
clear title to a similar space
in a more promising and nearby

00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:04.408
neighborhood.
 

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:11.187
There is a--we're creating a
market here that has a barter

00:14:11.187 --> 00:14:17.471
element in it,
land and a small cash payment,

00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:25.287
and an effort to facilitate the
financing of replacement

00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:26.850
housing.
 

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:35.775
So after the people make those
moves, this is theory,

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:43.845
you get a much denser occupancy
grid in the top,

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:50.538
and you get some benefit from
that;

00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:53.509
one benefit is that crime
generally goes down.

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:59.120
A neighborhood which is mostly
vacant lots is an invitation to

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.960
criminal activity.
 

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.438
The statistics on this area in
Baltimore, and it had hundreds

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:08.947
of areas like this one,
the crime statistics are

00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:09.769
brutal.
 

00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:14.975
Another fact is that the
administration of public

00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:21.264
services is wildly inefficient
where only a few houses in a

00:15:21.264 --> 00:15:25.820
neighborhood have trash to take
away,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.139
where streets need to be plowed
and cleaned,

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:37.068
even when very few people use
them and where police services

00:15:37.068 --> 00:15:39.658
are stretched extremely thin.
 

00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:44.788
The idea is to densify one area
at the expense of another,

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:51.774
and then to demolish and
replace the condemned houses in

00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:59.139
the stronger neighborhood and
you've made some progress.

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:03.519
Well the first thing
that--what's the first objection

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.289
that comes to mind?
 

00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:11.980
What do you do with this?
 

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:18.200
This now vacant area,
what do you do with it?

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.220
Anybody got a suggestion?
 

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.970
Sasha?
 

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.918
Student:  Make it a park.
 

00:16:26.918 --> 00:16:28.990
Prof: Make it a park,
that's good,

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.480
and it could be a park with a
huge lake in it,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.908
lakes are much easier to
administer than--

00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:42.389
you don't have to mow lakes,
and crime is relatively

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:45.142
scarce--
aquatic crime is,

00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:48.918
as far as I know,
rare.

00:16:48.918 --> 00:16:52.460
Or in some places,
you make it a golf course.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.546
There's a place in Miami where
they've created a zone where

00:16:57.546 --> 00:17:00.107
they've just--
it just grows wildly,

00:17:00.107 --> 00:17:03.418
it's largely bamboo and there's
a 12-foot fence around it,

00:17:03.418 --> 00:17:06.226
and the thought is that 50
years from now somebody will

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:07.890
figure out what to do with it.
 

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:13.411
That's one problem,
but there's another set of

00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:20.405
problems that are even tougher,
and that is that all these

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:24.210
neighborhoods have leaders.
 

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:30.336
Leaders are not really very
generous about having you take

00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:32.808
their followers away.
 

00:17:32.808 --> 00:17:38.117
People who are say Aldermen,
or people who are head of a

00:17:38.117 --> 00:17:43.364
neighborhood development board,
or of a neighborhood crime

00:17:43.364 --> 00:17:46.690
watch, they all come forward and
they say,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.700
"This is madness!
 

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.269
These people live in perfectly
good houses where they

00:17:52.269 --> 00:17:55.634
are," and the ultimate
effect is to drive the

00:17:55.634 --> 00:17:58.519
transaction costs through the
ceiling.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:06.358
The cost of getting the deals
made is astronomically high.

00:18:06.358 --> 00:18:12.523
It's a perfect illustration of
why the Coase theorem is

00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:15.895
serious,
because if the transaction

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:20.971
costs are high enough,
even obviously beneficial to

00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:24.970
all sides swaps,
just don't happen.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.348
De Soto is dealing with
environments in which

00:18:29.348 --> 00:18:33.328
transaction costs are extremely
high,

00:18:33.328 --> 00:18:40.079
in which the difficulty of
getting things like this done

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:44.108
are--
is just very, very great.

00:18:44.108 --> 00:18:50.630
It's fine for you and I to read
this elegant little book,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.226
but that's very different from
actually accomplishing things on

00:18:56.226 --> 00:18:59.790
the street,
so that this triangular

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.895
relationship between imaginary
leaders would become a dominant

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.700
obstacle to completion of the
task.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.630
Back to Coase.
 

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:18.463
The thesis, as you will
remember, is that where there

00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:24.217
are clear cut entitlements,
a high degree of transparency

00:19:24.217 --> 00:19:29.202
and symmetrical transparency,
and low transaction costs,

00:19:29.202 --> 00:19:32.009
efficient swaps are feasible.
 

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:38.019
And on the surface de Soto is
all about clear entitlement.

00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:44.602
He's perfectly aware that
without being able to execute

00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:48.493
economic transactions,
for example,

00:19:48.493 --> 00:19:51.308
borrowing against a clear
entitlement,

00:19:51.308 --> 00:19:54.650
very little has been
accomplished.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.653
That if corruption,
for example,

00:19:57.653 --> 00:20:02.303
interdicts transparency,
those transactions won't

00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:08.308
happen, or if they do they will
be the wrong transactions.

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:17.151
One way to think about how to
use de Soto practically is to

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:26.298
take the three conditions from
this simplified version of the

00:20:26.298 --> 00:20:35.749
Coase theorem and put them in a
table with relatively practical

00:20:35.749 --> 00:20:42.000
categories that you can deal
with,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.269
and then look for ways in
which, for example,

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:56.960
education might impact
transparency and so on.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.000
I'm going to--what I want to do
is proceed much less formally

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.808
than this.
 

00:21:01.808 --> 00:21:06.608
The chart is kind of--it's a
very rigid framework,

00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:11.410
it's not a bad framework,
but it's a rigid one.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.237
Now have some of you thought
about how you'd spend 5% of the

00:21:15.237 --> 00:21:16.470
GDP of a country?
 

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.970
Wave if you have.
 

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:24.096
I've got one,
two--more--one,

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:29.588
two--no one in this section?
 

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:35.559
Three--no one's fessing up in
the front row here.

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:39.180
Over here?
 

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.439
Okay we're going to--there we
are in the back--so we're going

00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:42.869
to do some winging here,
I'm afraid.

00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:47.200
That's okay.
 

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:56.818
Now Leslie, will you trade me
places?

00:21:56.818 --> 00:22:05.241
There's some chalk--now
what--the exercise is to figure

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:13.976
out if we can create large
increments in useful wealth by

00:22:13.976 --> 00:22:16.940
spending money.
 

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.430
Tom is it?
 

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.519
What have we got?
 

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:26.971
Student:  I think its
education is sort of the key to

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.328
everything else.
 

00:22:28.328 --> 00:22:30.979
Prof: Okay you would put
education ahead of any--of all

00:22:30.979 --> 00:22:31.368
things?
 

00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:32.858
Student:  All other
things.

00:22:32.858 --> 00:22:36.259
Prof: Okay,
help us understand why.

00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:38.934
Student:  Because I
think that having human capital

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:41.328
can increase your investment on
everything else,

00:22:41.328 --> 00:22:43.874
but without that,
you're not going to have the

00:22:43.874 --> 00:22:46.078
people that you need to build
roads,

00:22:46.078 --> 00:22:49.137
or expand property rights or
all these other things that de

00:22:49.137 --> 00:22:50.140
Soto talks about.
 

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.695
Prof: Okay so education,
a relatively well-educated

00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:57.002
populous is a necessary
condition, is that what you're

00:22:57.002 --> 00:22:57.690
saying?
 

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.890
Student:  Absolutely.
 

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.695
Prof: Okay are there any
necessary conditions to a

00:23:01.695 --> 00:23:03.048
well-educated population?
 

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:06.821
Student:  Well-educated
teachers I think would be

00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:07.440
better.
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.240
Prof: Okay so we have to
have well-educated teachers.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.980
Are there any other things we
probably need?

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.328
Yes.
 

00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:15.200
Student: 
&gt;

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.509
food and water.
 

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:20.083
Prof: Food,
running clean water,

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:24.126
electricity,
all the infrastructure--you buy

00:23:24.126 --> 00:23:25.349
that Tom?
 

00:23:25.349 --> 00:23:27.680
Student:  Sure.
 

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.769
Prof: Okay so education
was expensive to begin with,

00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:31.108
and now it's looking more
expensive,

00:23:31.108 --> 00:23:35.529
so we're probably going to need
more than 5% of GDP to get very

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:38.380
far with that but that's a good
thing.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.608
Tal?
 

00:23:39.608 --> 00:23:43.640
Student:  The other
problem with education is that,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.775
unless the opportunity costs of
the education for those workers

00:23:47.775 --> 00:23:51.470
are not extremely high,
they're not going to go school.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.118
The kids will end up trying to
make as much money as they can

00:23:55.118 --> 00:23:58.099
to support their families,
and so would not end up

00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:00.288
actually educating the populous.
 

00:24:00.288 --> 00:24:01.900
Prof: Absolutely,
spot on.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.298
There's an incident in White
Tiger which is exactly about

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:08.724
that,
where the uncle comes and drags

00:24:08.724 --> 00:24:14.329
our protagonist away from school
because his labor has been

00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:17.230
exchanged in a family deal.
 

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.068
Yes, back?
 

00:24:20.068 --> 00:24:28.838
Student:  There's also a
cultural problem,

00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:31.088
like certain societies don't
want females to go to school,

00:24:31.088 --> 00:24:34.509
so there's something deeper
than just opportunity costs at

00:24:34.509 --> 00:24:37.568
work there that must be dealt
with in other ways.

00:24:37.568 --> 00:24:40.819
Prof: I'm sure you're
right.

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:44.548
Can you give a specific example?
 

00:24:44.548 --> 00:24:49.516
Student:  Well I was
watching a movie and it was

00:24:49.516 --> 00:24:55.125
about Indian societies in which
women are not allowed to go to

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:59.023
school,
and the figure in the movie,

00:24:59.023 --> 00:25:02.605
the leading hero,
was actually based on a real

00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:06.218
life figure who went into the
village and convinced all these

00:25:06.218 --> 00:25:09.710
different families to let their
children go to school,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.509
because it would be better for
them in the long run,

00:25:13.509 --> 00:25:16.971
but not based on opportunity
costs but basically trying to

00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:19.818
change their cultural,
kind of closedness.

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:23.182
Prof: What's behind this
prohibition on educating women

00:25:23.182 --> 00:25:24.118
do you suppose?
 

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:28.150
Student:  I think it's
partly to do with the males.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.338
Prof: I'll bet on that,
you think?

00:25:32.338 --> 00:25:35.400
Student:  I know that in
certain families as well,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.460
like the female cannot be more
educated then the male.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.087
In marriages--
Prof: A precept I

00:25:41.087 --> 00:25:41.940
certainly believe in.
 

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.923
Student:  Sometimes a
family believes that if their

00:25:45.923 --> 00:25:49.083
females are too educated,
then they won't be able to

00:25:49.083 --> 00:25:51.588
marry them off,
or something like that.

00:25:51.588 --> 00:25:54.220
Prof: Okay,
that's terrific thank you.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.660
Yes?
 

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.071
Student:  You also need
infrastructure in place,

00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:02.799
and laws in an economy in place
for what they're going to do

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.568
after they go to school.
 

00:26:04.568 --> 00:26:08.143
In Cuba they have fantastic
education but no opportunities

00:26:08.143 --> 00:26:10.400
for anyone after that's
finished,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.200
so for education to be
effective you also have to

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.210
invest in,
sort of like, the next step.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.440
Prof: Okay,
so for education to be

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.670
effective we have to have a next
step.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.640
Is the Cuban example one you
know well?

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.779
Student:  I wouldn't say
I know it well.

00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:33.656
That scares me;
I don't want you to ask me a

00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:34.779
question I don't know.
 

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:37.630
Prof: Well can you--I
mean I've got a couple of--

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.547
I've been to Cuba a couple of
times and I have a couple of

00:26:40.547 --> 00:26:42.849
Cuba stories that could fill in
the blank,

00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:44.960
but how about you try it first.
 

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.739
Student:  I tried to go
to Cuba, but I didn't get a

00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:51.788
visa, so I don't know it as well
as I would.

00:26:51.788 --> 00:26:57.804
They have--well it has a lot to
do with the communist/socialist

00:26:57.804 --> 00:26:58.578
model.
 

00:26:58.578 --> 00:27:02.880
There's just no--there just
aren't any jobs,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.373
there aren't any--so if you're
educated as a lawyer you just

00:27:05.373 --> 00:27:08.179
end up being,
like, a taxi driver no matter

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:08.619
what.
 

00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:10.308
Prof: Okay, good.
 

00:27:10.308 --> 00:27:14.380
There's a--I have friend whom I
met in Havana,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.088
who was sort of top five among
the fishery scientists in Cuba,

00:27:19.088 --> 00:27:24.106
PhD in biology,
and he was--he kept giving the

00:27:24.106 --> 00:27:25.778
wrong advice.
 

00:27:25.778 --> 00:27:30.490
After the Russians pulled out
in the so-called special period,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.980
the government wanted to
double, and double,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.356
and double the harvest of
shrimp, and there are limits on

00:27:39.356 --> 00:27:42.130
the ecosystem,
and he kept saying,

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.548
"You can't do it,"
and finally they declared him

00:27:45.548 --> 00:27:46.509
unemployable.
 

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:51.097
And the effect of that was that
he became a taxi driver and

00:27:51.097 --> 00:27:52.759
trebled his income.
 

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:57.136
It was still a very low income,
but it trebled what he was

00:27:57.136 --> 00:27:58.980
making as a scientist.
 

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:07.519
Hands over here, yes?
 

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:10.411
Student:  One of the
downsides of education is brain

00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:10.808
drain.
 

00:28:10.808 --> 00:28:13.776
You put all your resources into
educating people but there are

00:28:13.776 --> 00:28:16.838
better opportunities in other
countries for them to go work,

00:28:16.838 --> 00:28:19.596
make money, and stay there,
so if you are going to put

00:28:19.596 --> 00:28:22.718
education as your main emphasis
you need to have some sort of

00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:25.838
incentive within your own
country to have people remain.

00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:30.630
Prof: Okay,
Tom do you want to answer that?

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.523
Student:  I agree that's
a problem but I think it's maybe

00:28:33.523 --> 00:28:35.500
less of a problem then it first
appears,

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.301
because of remittances,
or even in cases of brain drain

00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:41.080
where people are--
get well educated and go be

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.788
doctors in America rather than
in India,

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:47.205
they're still going to send a
percentage of that money home in

00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:50.510
the form of remittances which
can do a lot in itself to prop

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.519
up an economy.
 

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:56.088
Prof: In the back.
 

00:28:56.088 --> 00:28:57.279
Student:  So I won't
take all the credit for this,

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:00.630
Richard has been convincing me
by degrees as this goes on,

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.383
I think, I mean,
you'd rather have 100% of that

00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:06.734
income in your country,
and the way to get that would

00:29:06.734 --> 00:29:08.087
be through,
for instance,

00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:10.410
creating pools of capital in
your country through direct

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.773
foreign investment and then the
way you would get that is

00:29:12.773 --> 00:29:15.180
through investments and
infrastructure and security.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.977
Prof: Okay,
now we're--we have veered a

00:29:18.977 --> 00:29:23.703
long way from education when we
talk about direct foreign

00:29:23.703 --> 00:29:24.970
investment.
 

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.200
Would you put that as a high
priority?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.460
Student:  Higher than
education,

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.568
because I think that that
comes, but I think you need to

00:29:32.568 --> 00:29:35.846
be able to give people jobs and
a livelihood before you can

00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:37.598
think about educating them.
 

00:29:37.598 --> 00:29:43.529
Prof: Okay what do you
think Tom?

00:29:43.529 --> 00:29:46.622
Student:  I think you're
sort of endorsing the idea of

00:29:46.622 --> 00:29:49.541
offering your country up as--
to be colonialized more or

00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:52.441
less, in saying that well the
best thing that we can do to

00:29:52.441 --> 00:29:55.239
spur our own economic growth is
to offer ourselves as an

00:29:55.239 --> 00:29:57.790
extractive nation,
and we'll build the roads for

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.124
people to come in,
and take out what they need,

00:30:00.124 --> 00:30:03.203
and I don't know if that's the
solution for long term economic

00:30:03.203 --> 00:30:03.710
growth.
 

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.539
That's how I would read that
interpretation.

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:12.358
Prof: Richard?
 

00:30:12.358 --> 00:30:14.748
Student:  I think in the
long run in order to build

00:30:14.748 --> 00:30:16.338
sustainable growth in your
country,

00:30:16.338 --> 00:30:18.827
if you're starting off where
you don't have any of this

00:30:18.827 --> 00:30:21.269
infrastructure or educational
facilities in place,

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:23.990
you have to find some sort of
competitive advantage.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.970
At the initial standpoint
that's going to be your labor,

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.548
that's going to be your
resources, anything you can

00:30:28.548 --> 00:30:31.846
offer up that's going to attract
investment to build out the rest

00:30:31.846 --> 00:30:34.890
of these different pillars of
what you need in society.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.242
You can't just start off with,
here's the school and we're

00:30:37.242 --> 00:30:39.556
going to educate people and
they're going to keep all the

00:30:39.556 --> 00:30:42.107
value within society,
they're going to capitalize on

00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:44.769
it, there's not an incentive
based to really do that.

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:47.179
So until you can actually move
up the ladder of competitive

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:49.630
advantage and development of
your markets and education,

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.503
and quality of life,
it's sort of putting the cart

00:30:52.503 --> 00:30:54.440
before the horse in my opinion.
 

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.390
Prof: Okay.
 

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:01.175
Now what's fairly obvious in
this conversation is that you've

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:05.710
got to try to do more than one
thing at once.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.150
If we just say education full
stop,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.691
or if we say,
foreign direct investment full

00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:16.484
stop,
we're not going to get it done

00:31:16.484 --> 00:31:20.328
and there has to be a complex
spiral of these things.

00:31:20.328 --> 00:31:24.327
This is why the book by Clark
that we read is so unpersuasive

00:31:24.327 --> 00:31:27.384
on this point,
because it takes one thing at a

00:31:27.384 --> 00:31:31.359
time and then says,
well that won't do it and it's

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:35.009
the spiraling of several things
at once.

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:41.170
Shoshanna, back there.
 

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.872
Student:  I think the
problem goes back to the

00:31:43.872 --> 00:31:46.990
question at hand because with 5%
of GDP you really can't--

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.834
I think the problem goes back
to the question at hand because

00:31:49.834 --> 00:31:52.772
you can't really do much with 5%
of your GDP so people are more

00:31:52.772 --> 00:31:55.238
likely to create this false
dichotomy of options just

00:31:55.238 --> 00:31:57.230
because they have limited
resources.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.924
Prof: Okay,
but if this were a real

00:32:02.924 --> 00:32:10.842
exercise and you had control
over 5% of the GDP of Cuba or

00:32:10.842 --> 00:32:16.259
Peru, or Nigeria what would you
do?

00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:19.751
You've got the 5% what's the
first thing you better figure

00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:20.118
out?
 

00:32:20.118 --> 00:32:23.354
Student:  I think you
have to focus on getting basic

00:32:23.354 --> 00:32:25.920
resources and developing a basic
structure,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.008
so you may have to forfeit your
emphasis on education

00:32:29.008 --> 00:32:29.838
immediately.
 

00:32:29.838 --> 00:32:33.252
Prof: Okay,
but what I'm driving at is that

00:32:33.252 --> 00:32:37.920
you would want to look at what's
already happening the right way.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.578
You would want to,
say, if there are--

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:44.190
if there are twelve conditions
we're worried about,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:48.025
you'd want to survey and figure
out that there were three or

00:32:48.025 --> 00:32:51.470
four where you could ride
somebody else's dollar so to

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.118
speak.
 

00:32:52.118 --> 00:32:56.250
Then you would figure out some
crucial set of others that you

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.450
would have to pay your attention
to, does that sound right?

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.838
Student:  I think that's
fair.

00:33:01.838 --> 00:33:04.832
I think the problem lies in--I
was focusing on central Asian

00:33:04.832 --> 00:33:07.420
countries when you gave us this
mini assignment,

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.710
and the problem comes when you
devote everything to foreign

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.868
direct investment,
when do you stop?

00:33:11.868 --> 00:33:15.258
When do you transition back to
meeting all those other criteria

00:33:15.258 --> 00:33:17.278
that you laid out in the
beginning?

00:33:17.278 --> 00:33:21.919
Prof: Okay,
so it sounds like this is a

00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:24.910
pretty complicated subject.
 

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.640
Richard?
 

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.618
Student:  I apologize.
 

00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:29.602
I wanted to clarify what we
were--our point was which is by

00:33:29.602 --> 00:33:32.738
attracting foreign investment
the idea is that is not mutually

00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:35.368
exclusive,
so instead of taking a limited

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:39.088
5% of GDP and allocating it
towards one aspect of society,

00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:41.945
if you can signal to the
broader markets that you're an

00:33:41.945 --> 00:33:44.909
attractive investment place
you've now grown that pool of

00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:47.606
capital such that it can be
invested through all the

00:33:47.606 --> 00:33:50.835
different aspects of what you
need to build society as opposed

00:33:50.835 --> 00:33:53.108
to cherry picking one over
another.

00:33:53.108 --> 00:33:55.618
That's the goal of attracting
multiple investors.

00:33:55.618 --> 00:34:00.746
Prof: One of--so the one
thing that we're at least clear

00:34:00.746 --> 00:34:04.220
about is that there is no secret
sauce,

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.651
there's no one secret sauce
that is going to get this job

00:34:07.651 --> 00:34:08.079
done.
 

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.340
It's vastly more complex.
 

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.340
Now who--did you have your hand
up a moment ago?

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.590
Student:  I think it's
&gt;

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.159
Prof: Been covered?
 

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.300
Student:  I think it has.
 

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.054
Prof: Okay.
 

00:34:20.054 --> 00:34:24.050
Who will give us a fresh start
with a--

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:29.496
Student:  I was going to
say that what de Soto keeps

00:34:29.496 --> 00:34:34.849
emphasizing is the importance of
political leadership,

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:37.186
and what he forgets is that in
many of these developing

00:34:37.186 --> 00:34:39.072
countries,
the political leadership itself

00:34:39.072 --> 00:34:41.217
is very corrupt,
and it's not within the

00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:44.630
leadership's best interest to
move the society forward,

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.659
so I thought that empowering
education would give us better

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.583
leaders that would follow de
Soto's ideas of transforming

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:52.829
debt capital
&gt;.

00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:54.817
Prof: So you and Tom are
playing the same tune,

00:34:54.817 --> 00:34:55.380
more or less?
 

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:55.809
Student:  Yes.
 

00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:57.940
Prof: Same tune,
slightly different rationale.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.369
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:02.909
Prof: Okay good.
 

00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:05.333
Student:  I was just
about to add to that with an

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:07.315
example, actually,
of a Kosovo case that I had

00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:08.550
experienced this summer.
 

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.329
When I was in Kosovo they had a
hard time attracting leaders

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:15.980
because most of them fled as
refugees in the 1999 war,

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.628
so the USAID program had
invested, instead of like this

00:35:19.628 --> 00:35:22.130
foreign direct investment
project,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.460
there are projects in that as
well,

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.969
but a professional studies
course that educates leaders,

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:30.074
particularly in finance and
investments and these sorts of

00:35:30.074 --> 00:35:31.885
things,
so it's bringing the brain

00:35:31.885 --> 00:35:34.293
drain back--
like back into the country,

00:35:34.293 --> 00:35:36.789
and investing in leaders
instead of--

00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:39.516
so then once they have an
efficient leadership base they

00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:41.699
can go out and do these things
themselves.

00:35:41.699 --> 00:35:44.585
Prof: Did I just hear
you say that MBA education is

00:35:44.585 --> 00:35:46.610
the most important thing in the
world?

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.550
Student:  Wouldn't that
be nice.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.800
Prof: Thanks.
 

00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:00.639
Who would--are there--why am I
doing that?

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:10.380
Who would start us with an
entirely different starting

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.768
point, yes?
 

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:16.449
Student:  I don't know
how you would do this with 5% of

00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:19.887
the GDP but I think if there
were secret sauce it would be

00:36:19.887 --> 00:36:22.360
efficiency and low transaction
costs.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.260
This is coming from my
experience in Latin America,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.909
which, I've worked there and
I've traveled there,

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:30.780
and I don't even understand how
they do business there ever,

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.889
because it's so inefficient.
 

00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:37.838
Like down to little things,
like I know in Buenos Aries

00:36:37.838 --> 00:36:42.373
they don't have enough coins but
you can only pay with coins to

00:36:42.373 --> 00:36:45.038
ride the bus,
but there's a shortage of

00:36:45.038 --> 00:36:48.489
coins, and so sometimes you just
can't get on the bus because you

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:50.539
have cash but you don't have
coins.

00:36:50.539 --> 00:36:53.342
It's little things like that,
but I don't know how you

00:36:53.342 --> 00:36:55.298
would--
like where you would even begin

00:36:55.298 --> 00:36:57.590
to invest to make those things
more efficient,

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.541
but I think the foreign direct
investment and the competitive

00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:03.320
advantage flow from that.
 

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.534
You're not going to be a good
candidate unless you have low

00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:10.369
transaction costs within the
country.

00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:12.018
Prof: Okay.
 

00:37:12.018 --> 00:37:16.554
What I think I hear you saying
is that you've got to get the

00:37:16.554 --> 00:37:18.400
Coase theorem working?
 

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.184
Student:  Right and that
has something to do with

00:37:21.184 --> 00:37:24.222
corruption, or a lot to do with
corruption of the government,

00:37:24.222 --> 00:37:25.489
and the legal system.
 

00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:28.389
Prof: Okay, good.
 

00:37:28.389 --> 00:37:33.320
Yes?
 

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.380
Student:  A couple of
things that I'd do here.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.494
If you're getting 5% of the
GDP, one thing that we should

00:37:38.494 --> 00:37:41.719
keep in mind is that we can
assume that the economy will go

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:44.730
on forever,
so I would not spend 5% of the

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.710
GDP in that way given here.
 

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.500
I'd divide it over a number of
years.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.280
The second is that the money
that I'd be getting,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.699
I would not leave a penny in
the hands of the government.

00:37:55.699 --> 00:37:58.880
I would give it to the private
sector and ear market a thousand

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.960
villages and ask the private
sector to use that money in that

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.090
thousand villages.
 

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.869
The next year,
based on their performances,

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:08.543
the second allotment that I
would get out of that 5% of the

00:38:08.543 --> 00:38:11.172
GDP would be again given to the
private companies who have

00:38:11.172 --> 00:38:12.050
performed well.
 

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.016
Now I'll leave it up to them
how do they want to develop the

00:38:15.016 --> 00:38:16.768
villages,
it can be a holistic

00:38:16.768 --> 00:38:19.530
development, it can be
incomplete development,

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.869
it can be corrupt development,
but the second year's resources

00:38:22.869 --> 00:38:25.773
would be only going on the basis
of the quality of the

00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:26.650
development.
 

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.382
Prof: Okay so what you
want to do is put as much rocket

00:38:30.382 --> 00:38:33.869
fuel as you can in the rockets
that are already moving?

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:35.949
Student:  Exactly,
but make sure that the

00:38:35.949 --> 00:38:38.206
rockets--the next year the
rockets move based on the

00:38:38.206 --> 00:38:39.579
performance of the rockets.
 

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:42.728
Prof: Okay and if you
were a public official would

00:38:42.728 --> 00:38:45.539
there be some problem about that
do you imagine?

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:48.369
Student:  A lot of
problems.

00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:52.561
Prof: Right,
because the natural tendency is

00:38:52.561 --> 00:38:56.751
to redistribute from the
functioning rockets to the

00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:59.099
non-functioning rockets.
 

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.735
The axiom we saw twenty times
earlier in term about how a

00:39:03.735 --> 00:39:08.039
defining characteristic of
capitalism is that failing

00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:13.266
enterprises fail,
right, and that's one of the

00:39:13.266 --> 00:39:18.619
ways capitalism becomes a
learning machine.

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:24.699
You are a cruel but wise man.
 

00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:27.469
Yes?
 

00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:29.460
Student:  In many ways,
this is I guess the--

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.210
sort of the opposite of the
last comment,

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:35.409
but you could also see some
validity to the point of using

00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:40.050
that money to try to improve
government capacity in a sense,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.146
because, as we've been
discussing, the government is

00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:46.425
really a strong point for
creating the stability needed

00:39:46.425 --> 00:39:49.400
for investment in other parts of
the economy.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.677
So if there was some way to,
say, use the money to increase

00:39:54.677 --> 00:39:59.865
the reach of the government into
more rural regions of the

00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:04.262
country,
or to create secure borders,

00:40:04.262 --> 00:40:06.329
things like that.
 

00:40:06.329 --> 00:40:09.940
I think that that could have a
potentially positive effect,

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:16.190
and it's sort of a more direct
and centralized use of it,

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.090
so it might be a little bit
easier.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.393
Obviously you run into problems
with corruption in government

00:40:20.393 --> 00:40:21.989
and, not that that's minor.
 

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:23.170
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.260
That's a very plausible
thought, where you have a weak

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.815
state which doesn't have the
ability to actually enforce the

00:40:31.815 --> 00:40:35.829
law or to carry out policy in an
effective way,

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:37.869
say, in rural areas.
 

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:43.586
Think of Western China or large
chunks of Afghanistan,

00:40:43.586 --> 00:40:48.393
or nearly all of Somalia;
strengthening the state if

00:40:48.393 --> 00:40:52.545
you've got the right incentives
for the people who benefit

00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:55.460
directly from the increment of
power.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.443
You've got to have the right
people there with the right

00:40:57.443 --> 00:40:58.699
incentives,
and if you have the wrong

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:03.070
people and the wrong incentives,
you're actually going to make

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.690
things worse.
 

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:10.400
Tal.
 

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.382
Student:  I sort of have
two different--very different

00:41:13.382 --> 00:41:13.780
ideas.
 

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.391
One that's sort of bottom up
and one that's sort of top down,

00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:19.800
from two different parts of the
world.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.750
The first one that's sort of
bottom up would build on the

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.110
work of,
sort of, micro finance,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.670
especially in India and
countries like that,

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:32.518
where we've seen that if you
give entrepreneurs,

00:41:32.518 --> 00:41:35.010
even at the village level,
some basic capital they can--

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.630
even based on their dead
capital, sort of,

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.750
they can turn it into live
capital themselves,

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.860
especially women.
 

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.355
And if you can focus on that
you can maybe build up sort of a

00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:49.559
local economy that's sustainable
in its own right,

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:55.960
and not just sort of at the
whim of FDI.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.856
At the same time,
to use a part of the world that

00:41:58.856 --> 00:42:02.005
I'm a little more familiar with,
Israel--my parents are from

00:42:02.005 --> 00:42:04.422
Israel,
I spent a good deal of time

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:07.744
there, used to be--
it was built up on the Kibbutz

00:42:07.744 --> 00:42:09.668
system,
socialist system,

00:42:09.668 --> 00:42:14.242
and had many of the same
problems of the former Communist

00:42:14.242 --> 00:42:18.266
nations almost at first,
and then transitioned into a

00:42:18.266 --> 00:42:21.179
much more capitalist market
oriented economy,

00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:24.099
one that is arguably quite
strong.

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:26.599
Part of the way that was
accomplished was,

00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:30.240
as much as it pains me to say,
through state sponsored

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.090
enterprise much in the way that
China accomplished it.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.590
In the sort of building up of
basic utilities and

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.110
infrastructure and the companies
that served the people's needs

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.048
for those and then sort of
spread outwards and actually

00:42:46.048 --> 00:42:49.768
turning that informal sort of
communal property into

00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:53.050
individual property and live
capital.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:57.300
Prof: Okay,
let's stop and take stock here

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.630
for a minute.
 

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:04.135
We've heard a dozen or fifteen
points of view,

00:43:04.135 --> 00:43:10.744
every single one of them
intelligent, and no single one

00:43:10.744 --> 00:43:16.130
of them any major fraction of an
answer.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:21.237
There is some pattern of
webbing together different

00:43:21.237 --> 00:43:26.855
strategies and of custom fitting
those strategies to the

00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:32.780
circumstance of actual countries
and actual cultures,

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.389
anfd actual governmental
systems, and actual

00:43:36.389 --> 00:43:38.489
infrastructure systems.
 

00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:42.389
We've said very little so far
today about infrastructure,

00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:46.510
and arguably trains,
planes, harbors,

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:51.610
all that should be an
important, at least late stage

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:57.739
and very possibly middle stage,
element in a strategy.

00:43:57.739 --> 00:44:02.902
Next time we're--our text is
The White Tiger, and I

00:44:02.902 --> 00:44:08.701
would like to be able to call on
you to bring forth the anecdotes

00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:13.684
from White Tiger because
we're going to use it as

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:18.485
follows: the circumstances
described in this brilliant

00:44:18.485 --> 00:44:22.923
novel are almost invariably
circumstances that are

00:44:22.923 --> 00:44:29.724
destructive of wealth formation,
and so think about the events

00:44:29.724 --> 00:44:33.472
which happen in the book,
and then, in class,

00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:35.780
we're going to flip them on
their heads,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.916
so to speak,
and talk about what might be

00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:46.034
beneficial to the protagonist,
and more generally,

00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:51.349
to village India,
and village Indians who come,

00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:56.842
in the language of the book,
out of the darkness into the

00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:57.639
cities.
 

00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:03.467
I'll show you a short film clip
of a company called SELCO,

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:08.679
which is in the business of
making off-grid electric

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:11.849
lighting for village India.
 

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:15.938
Then before the end of term
you'll see a full business case

00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:17.420
about this company.
 

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:24.018
It's a for-profit company,
and it depends on micro finance

00:45:24.018 --> 00:45:26.219
to sell lighting.
 

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:30.737
There are many parts of India
where there just isn't any

00:45:30.737 --> 00:45:35.255
artificial lighting and
the--it's quite an inspiring and

00:45:35.255 --> 00:45:36.980
interesting case.
 

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.239
So I'll see you on Monday and
if you haven't yet read every

00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:45.719
last page of White Tiger
I'd do it over the weekend.

00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:51.000

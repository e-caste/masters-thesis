00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.020
- Today we're gonna talk about

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.330
Unemployment, Reemployment,
and Income Security,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.270
or income insecurity as the case might be.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.670
So, let's start with some something to get

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.973
our attention focused on that question.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.690
- [Narrator] We're hauling
20,000 pounds of freight

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.550
down the Florida Turnpike

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.770
in a self-driving, robotic truck.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.060
It's been retrofitted
with a self-driving kit

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.210
made by Starsky Robotics.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.380
Kartik Tiwari and Stefan Seltz-Axmacher

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.470
founded the company in 2016.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.980
- We think that sometime
towards the end of the year,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.230
we could be doing this run

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.940
without a person behind the wheel.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.100
- This year?
- Yeah.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
- Self-driving trucks this year?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.933
- Yep.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.680
- [Narrator] And if it's not
his company, it might be OTTO,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.120
whose truck made headlines last October

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000
by driving itself across Colorado

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.830
to deliver a shipment of beer.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.150
OTTO is owned by Uber,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.680
which has also been
testing self-driving taxis

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.990
in Pennsylvania and Arizona.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.490
But here's the thing.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.460
Once our trucks and
taxis drive themselves,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.120
what will happen to the people
who used to do those jobs?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.707
In the US, that's 180,000 taxi drivers,

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:27.410
600,000 Uber drivers,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.420
and three and a half
million truck drivers.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.620
- We really need to start to think

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.800
very seriously about this.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.150
- [Narrator] Martin Ford is the author

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.970
of "Rise of the Robots".

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.910
- [Martin] This is it.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.800
- [Narrator] He says
driverless cars and trucks

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.550
are just the beginning
of a wave of automation

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.920
that will threaten millions of jobs

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.873
in every industry at once.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.720
Like America's nearly five
million store workers.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.270
- The cashiers are totally gone.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.650
You're gonna end up with
the equivalent of a Walmart

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.170
with a handful of employees.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.040
You scale that out,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.600
and that's just
extraordinarily disruptive.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.340
- [Narrator] You name an occupation

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.679
and there's somebody considering
a robot to take it over.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.183
- Look how delicate.
- Perfect every time.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.460
- [Narrator] At Zume
Pizza in Silicon Valley,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.443
four specialized robots
help make the pizza.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.020
Eventually, the company plans to replace

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.790
the remaining humans on the line too.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790
The common wisdom is that
robots primarily threaten

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.247
repetitive, blue-collar jobs.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.690
"Not so," says Martin Ford.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.680
- We're seeing dramatic advances

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.870
in the area of computers analyzing tumors,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.670
recognizing medical scans, mammograms,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.920
and being able to find disease.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.390
We're seeing algorithms moving to areas

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.340
like journalism, for example.
- Wait, wait wait.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.780
Certainly not journalism.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.460
- Oh yeah, absolutely journalism.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.530
By one account, every 30 seconds

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.550
there's a new story published on the web

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.800
or maybe in a newspaper
that's machine-generated.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.290
- [Narrator] Algorithms
are even threatening

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.280
the masters of the universe.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.130
Earlier this year, BlackRock,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.040
the world's largest money manager,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.060
announced that it's laying off
dozens of human stock pickers

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.590
and replacing them with robots.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.990
By 2025, across the financial industry,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.600
artificial intelligence
is expected to replace

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.050
230,000 human workers.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.650
- Bring on the disruption
that is automation.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.070
- [Narrator] Elisha Wiesel is
the chief information officer

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.110
at Goldman Sachs.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.480
The company now hires nearly
as many computer engineers

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.980
as financial workers.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.690
A quarter of these people aren't traders.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.760
They're coders, writing
software to automate

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.030
the routine grunt work of
employees all across the company.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.660
According to one recent study,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.890
47% of American jobs could
be lost to automation

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.840
in the next 20 years.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.910
- I'm sure 20 years from now,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.890
almost no one will be driving a vehicle.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.607
Young people are forward
looking and they say,

00:03:57.607 --> 00:03:59.447
"Well, I guess I'm not
gonna have a driving career,

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.090
"so I'm not gonna go there."

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.197
- Well, except that these
young people might think,

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:04.790
"Well, maybe I'll go into retail,"

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.877
but that's also going away.

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:08.497
"Well, maybe I'm be a chef,"
but that's also going away.

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:09.840
"Well, maybe I'll be a paralegal,"

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.040
but that's also going away.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.190
- So, let's do the
following thought exercise.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.810
It's the year 1900,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.460
and 40% of all employment
is in agriculture, right?

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.900
And so some twerpy economist from MIT

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.640
teleports back in time
to Farmer Pogue here

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.867
and says, "A hundred years from now,

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.327
"only 2% of people will
be working in agriculture.

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:34.453
"What do you think the other
38% of people are gonna do?"

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:35.286
- Well, I wouldn't know.

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:38.087
- Would you say, "Oh,
search engine optimization,

00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:41.070
"health and wellness,
software and mobile devices,"?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.530
Most of what we do barely
existed 100 years ago.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.363
- [Narrator] In other words,

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:48.180
just because we can't
predict what we'll be doing

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.980
doesn't mean we'll be doing nothing.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.650
- So, there you see the great debate

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.240
that is now being fostered
among economists and others

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.630
about the likely effects of automation.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.670
On the one hand, there
are people who are saying

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.910
this is a fundamentally new
development, that these,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.220
that essentially all
employment is going away

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.980
and there's gonna be
nothing for people to do.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.460
On the other hand, you
see people say, "Well,"

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.583
as was said at the end in
the last part of that clip,

00:05:25.327 --> 00:05:28.397
"In 1900, if people had had to speculate

00:05:28.397 --> 00:05:31.787
"where everybody who was
gonna be put out of work

00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:35.067
"in the agricultural
economy was gonna wind up,

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:39.440
"they wouldn't have had any
idea as to where they would go."

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.440
And so just as all kinds
of industries have emerged

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.180
over the course of the last century

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.880
that nobody could have dreamed
of at the beginning of it,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.650
so the same thing will
happen in the next century,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.390
and there will be all
kinds of new employment.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.793
Life has more imagination than us.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.990
People will innovate in new ways,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.160
with techniques we can't even consider.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.830
And that is certainly
gonna be an open question,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.800
not a debate we would
settle in this course,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.390
let alone whether anybody
else can settle it.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.220
What is clear, though,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.160
as I've emphasized in previous lectures

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.830
is that the idea of long-term

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.560
employment security has gone away.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.610
And so our agenda today,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.470
whether people are gonna
ever get new employment

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.210
or they're gonna work through a series

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.210
of up to 13 of 15 or 20 jobs
over the course of a lifetime,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.440
the idea of a continuous stream of income

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.460
from one job that people get

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.890
upon finishing their formal K through 12

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.890
or perhaps K through college
education has gone away.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.230
And so our agenda to day
is how to think about

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.400
the best responses to endemic
and permanent wage insecurity.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.880
But I wanna do it with one
eye on last Tuesday's lecture.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.310
We wanna think not only
about the economics

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.140
and the ethics of what we want to

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.530
consider as desirable policies

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.720
but also the political feasibility.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.710
Where is it likely that
we can build coalitions

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.540
to actually implement
the sorts of policies

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.470
that might be desirable

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.373
and then find the resources for them,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.240
the proximate goals to make
sure they move steadily forward,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.010
the entrenchment to stop
them from being undone,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.930
and the leadership to put together

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.450
and hold together the
coalitions to do that,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.730
along with a moral narrative

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.570
that will be compelling to people

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.210
and can head off potential
blocking coalitions.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.670
So, we wanna keep all of that in mind.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.410
And I'm gonna talk about
four different topics

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.970
in connection with this.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.950
The first is an idea that
has actually been around

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.903
since the 1970s.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.860
Then this is the idea of UBI.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.860
That used to stand for
unconditional basic income.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.520
Now refers to the idea of
universal basic income.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.240
But this is the idea

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.240
that people should be given
some kind of financial grant

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.860
unrelated to work,
unrelated to employment.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.250
Second, we'll focus on minimum wages

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.250
and the political pressure
to put up minimum wages

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.010
in response to employment

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.740
wage stagnation and the
relative decline of wages

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.693
that we have talked about at some length.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.060
Then we will look at

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.560
something called the EITC,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.880
the Earned Income Tax Credit,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.000
which is a kind of wage
subsidy that has also

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.390
emerged in the 1970s and
gets a lot less press,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.480
but we, in my forthcoming
book with Michael Grant,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.060
think is much more
interesting and promising.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.580
And then finally we will
talk about the history

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.100
and prospects for transitional assistance.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.570
There have been programs

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.940
since the Kennedy
administration in this country

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.150
to provide people with
transitional assistance

00:09:38.442 --> 00:09:42.050
in moving from one job to another

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.277
that have not fared very well,

00:09:43.277 --> 00:09:44.760
and we'll talk about why

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.840
and what the prospects for them might be.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.410
So, let's start by going

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.740
first to the idea of an unconditional

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.423
or universal basic income.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.110
(gentle music)

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.250
- Well, there is now,
in Europe and beyond,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.350
more interest in the idea of
an unconditional basic income

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.230
than there has ever been
in the history of mankind.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.110
Why?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.390
Some people say it's because we predict

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.870
more automation, robotization.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.140
There is some truth in that,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.670
but this is combined

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.520
with a greater

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.700
uncertainty, greater doubts
about the feasibility,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.330
the desirability of what
has always been offered

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.650
as the central answer to
the problem of unemployment

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.790
by both the right and
the left, namely growth.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.830
And so if we think that growth is either,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.410
continued growth is either
not possible or not desirable

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.680
and that anyway it hasn't lost
the problem of unemployment

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.400
despite all the growth we've had,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.430
then it's high time to
think about something else,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.400
think seriously about an
unconditional basic income.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.090
A floor instead of a safety net.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.510
Something that would be a
central element in any project

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.831
for a free society and a sane economy.

00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:12.940
(gentle music)

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.170
- So, that is Philippe Van Parijs.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.890
He is a Belgian political philosopher

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.890
who has been championing
this idea for some time.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.950
He runs something called the
Basic Income European Network,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.510
since renamed the Basic
Income Earth Network.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.680
Was originally formed in 1986.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.960
The book in which he developed this idea

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.530
was called "Real Freedom for All",

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.363
it's the subtitle,

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:46.080
"What (if anything) can
justify capitalism?",

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.870
which he published over two decades ago.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.520
And he's a Rawlsian political philosopher.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.183
You might call him a
sort of left Rawlsian,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.350
and he took off from the core
insight in John Rawls's work,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.310
in John Rawls's work
"A Theory of Justice".

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.760
And this is a, in the first instance

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.338
is a philosophical argument
for the idea that people,

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:17.010
every human being in a society

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.980
should be entitled to an
unconditional basic income.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.910
And so what Rawls did,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.470
and what was considered
to be revolutionary

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.100
and is at the analytical core
of his "Theory of Justice",

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.548
was he said, "Well, think
about the differences

00:12:33.548 --> 00:12:36.420
"in capabilities between us."

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.633
Some people say, differences
in IQ for example.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.880
Some people say it's all about genetics.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.270
Some people say it's
all about environment.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.170
And there, usually, there are these big,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.320
ideologically charged fights.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.470
Is it genetics, is it not?

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.350
Are there IQ differences
between different ethnic groups,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.940
provoked Charles Murray and others,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.540
got into these hugely

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.520
charged, ideological fights

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.800
over this question in recent decades.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.800
Rawls says, "If the differences
between us are due to nature

00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:21.457
"well, then it's luck
in the genetic lottery.

00:13:21.457 --> 00:13:24.727
"If the differences between
us are due to nurture,

00:13:24.727 --> 00:13:28.640
"then it's luck in where
you happened to be born."

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.300
Either way, it's morally arbitrary.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.730
After all, you didn't choose

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.370
to have the genes that you've got,

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.200
and you didn't choose to
grow up in the country,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.930
never mind the family that
you found yourself in.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.050
You were either born into
or perhaps adopted into,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.140
it's nothing to do with you.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.420
And so the debate about
nature versus nurture

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.960
as to what people are entitled to

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.560
is really beside the point.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.720
And this is sometimes called
luck egalitarianism because

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.730
Rawls made an argument on that basis

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.140
for the proposition that all
the differences between us

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.700
are morally arbitrary

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.510
and we should think about
principles of justice

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.770
that take account of
that moral arbitrariness.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.470
And he developed his own theory,

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.773
which need not concern us here,

00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:27.640
the bottom line of which was that

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.160
inequalities can only be justified

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.160
if they benefit the least
advantaged people in the society.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.960
And he thought that that would trickle up,

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.780
a kind of Keynesian story if you like,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.010
and that would benefit everyone.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.080
So, Van Parijs had a slightly different

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.740
take on this Rawlsian insight.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.687
He said, "What it means is that
everybody should be entitled

00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:57.637
"to an unconditional basic income

00:14:57.637 --> 00:15:00.330
"at the highest sustainable level."

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.420
Be up to political economists
to figure out what that is,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.610
but that's what we should
all be entitled to.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.860
It should have nothing to do
with our capacities to work

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.980
at different levels of productivity.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.130
Should be independent of work.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.070
And so this was the egalitarian case

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.620
for as high as sustainable

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.733
an unconditional basic income.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.330
This generated a huge
debate among philosophers.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.620
Nobody paid a great
deal of attention to it

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.650
outside of the academy,

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.550
and, indeed, a fatal objection
was launched, eventually,

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.350
by a philosopher called Susan Hurley

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.387
in a critique of Rawls in which she said,

00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:48.120
"Well, you know,"...

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.970
This is, I put the
quotation up on the board,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.200
but the gist of it is the following.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.877
She said, "Well, it may be true

00:15:55.877 --> 00:16:00.187
"that the differences among
us are morally arbitrary,

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:01.757
"whether it's genetic luck

00:16:01.757 --> 00:16:06.537
"or luck in the lottery of
where we happen to be born

00:16:06.537 --> 00:16:09.557
"and so no one is,

00:16:09.557 --> 00:16:14.447
"in some natural sense,
entitled to what they produce,

00:16:14.447 --> 00:16:16.787
"but why should that
create any presumption

00:16:16.787 --> 00:16:19.017
"in favor of an equal distribution?

00:16:19.017 --> 00:16:23.547
"It could just as easily create
some different presumption

00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:25.610
"in some people's minds."

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.240
And so the gist of Hurley's point was,

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.690
actually, it doesn't justify
any distributive presumption,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.190
including, perhaps, that we're entitled

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.440
to the fruits of our individual labor.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.860
I'll come back to that.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.670
So, it no more justifies a
presumption in favor of equality

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.620
than a presumption in favor
of any other distribution.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.520
A case will have to be made,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.310
and so it doesn't follow sort of

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.080
in any pristine, analytical sense

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.040
that we should be entitled
to have a distribution

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.300
that works to the benefit
of the least advantaged,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.710
in Rawls's case,

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.210
or in Van Parijs's case,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.160
it doesn't follow in any
analytically tight sense

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.220
that everybody should be entitled

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:18.050
to the highest possible
sustainable income.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.780
And so the normative case

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.780
for this strong egalitarian
presumption sort of goes away.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.610
Now, you might say,
"Well, that's all true,"

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.020
but particularly in light

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.850
of what we've been
discussing in this course,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.680
there might still be a powerful case

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.270
for a universal basic income.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.400
Not, perhaps not the highest sustainable

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.300
universal basic income,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.530
but, nonetheless, it's
something that would

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.530
give everybody a cushion.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.330
It would enable people to deal

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.220
with the vicissitudes
of employment markets

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.940
and the vagaries of

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:04.230
secure jobs that we
have been attending to.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.600
And, indeed, one of the
presidential candidates,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.390
who has just made it into
the debates last night,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.060
is a strong proponent of a UBI.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.390
So, let's give him a little more air time

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.047
than he got last night.
(students laughing)

00:18:18.047 --> 00:18:21.360
- And you're running for
president based on this issue

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.480
of UBI, universal basic income.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.210
What is a universal basic income?

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.250
What is your plan?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.750
- Universal basic income is a policy where

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.910
every member of a society,
let's say every American adult,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.880
receives a certain amount of money to meet

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.810
his or her basic needs every month.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.210
And my plan, the Freedom Dividend,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.140
is that every American
adult would receive $1,000

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.507
per month, free and clear.

00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:44.850
- [Interviewer] $1,000 per month,

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.740
every American over the age of...

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.123
- 18.
- 18.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.510
This, to a lot of people,
is gonna sound like

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.320
a completely nutso idea.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.180
So, just to be clear, has the US ever,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.900
has any government body in
the US, existing or past,

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.100
ever done anything like this?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.570
- Well, a law essentially
identical to this

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.950
passed the House of Representatives

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.590
in 1971 under Richard Nixon.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.510
Martin Luther King was for it,
Milton Friedman was for it,

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.140
and a thousand economists signed a letter

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.750
saying this would be great
for the economy and society.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.400
And then a number of years later,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.510
Alaska passed something identical to this

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.180
in the form of the Petroleum Dividend,

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.230
where everyone in Alaska today receives

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.260
between one and two
thousand dollars a year,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.770
no questions asked,
from the petroleum fund.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.290
And if you think about this for a moment,

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.860
Alaska's a deep red, conservative state,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.180
and the Republican governor

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.140
made this case to the Alaskan people.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.227
He said, "Who would you
rather get the oil money,

00:19:37.227 --> 00:19:39.157
"the government, who's
just gonna screw it up,

00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:41.050
"or you, the Alaskan people?"

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.870
And the Alaskans said, "Us."

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.940
And then now the Petroleum
Dividend is wildly popular.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.010
It has increased children's,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.890
it's improved children's
health and nutrition,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.610
it has created thousands of jobs,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.550
and no one can touch it.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.730
And that's been in effect for 36 years.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.720
So, if you think about it,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.620
what is the oil of the 21st century?

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.170
The oil of the 21st century is data,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.540
AI, autonomous vehicles,
and advanced technologies,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.830
and that's how we're gonna pay

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.470
for our Freedom Dividend
for all Americans.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.210
I want everyone here to reflect.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.430
Why is Donald Trump our president today?

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.700
And the reason why Donald Trump

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.490
is our president today is this.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.830
We automated away four
million manufacturing jobs

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.830
in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.040
All of the swing states
that he needed to win.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.710
And now we're about to do the same thing

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.980
to millions of retail
jobs, call center jobs,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.250
truck driving jobs, fast food jobs,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.520
which are unfortunately the four

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.640
most common jobs in the economy.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.290
I have many friends in Silicon Valley

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.650
who are working on this,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.380
who know full well that this
trend is about to accelerate.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.900
So, if we don't wake up

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.360
and start implementing
meaningful solutions

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.170
to the fact that we are going
through the greatest economic

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.110
and technological transition
in the history of the world,

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.522
then we are doomed to much,
much worse than Donald Trump.

00:20:59.522 --> 00:21:02.360
(students murmuring nervously)

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.113
- So, that is Andrew Yang's platform.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.900
And he makes some very,
very convincing points.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.403
And if you think about it,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.083
if you have a universal basic income,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.400
it can also have a desirable effect on

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.930
relations within firms.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.890
And this goes back to our
old friend Albert Hirschman.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.330
If you think about...

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.573
If you think about a world, so,

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.170
where there's a continuum

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.780
from what we might call
a Dickensian nightmare,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.010
where there's no social
support of any kind

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.270
for people who lose their jobs,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.570
and at at the other hand
a surfer's paradise.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.570
I use the term surfer's paradise because

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.300
one of Van Parijs's famous lines

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.513
was that even surfer's should be paid.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.667
So, surfer's paradise,
it's Van Parijs's utopia.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.213
So, you should, you
could then think that the

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.370
power relations within the workplace

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.140
are greatly affected by where
you are on this continuum.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.190
Because if you are living
near a Dickensian nightmare,

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.280
where the costs of losing
your job are extremely high,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.617
and your employer says to you,

00:22:36.617 --> 00:22:38.310
"I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee,"

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.610
you're gonna scurry off
and get that cup of coffee

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.980
and come scurrying back quickly,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.810
whereas if you are closer
to the surfer's paradise

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.890
and you could walk away from your job,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.160
you might say, "Well, go
get your own coffee," right?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.630
And so there was a thought,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.800
there was big literature
in the '80s and '90s

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.590
which basically said that

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.290
if you, rather than trying
to have the government

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.730
produce more democracy within firms

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.000
to protect workers from
exploitative practices,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.598
it would be better to just
decrease the exit costs

00:23:16.598 --> 00:23:19.130
and then they'll have to treat you better.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.843
Just as, for example, at Yale,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.360
in 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.360
compulsory retirement was
illegal, age discrimination.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.350
And so the interaction of tenure

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.470
and the abolition of compulsory retirement

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.170
created a huge problem for universities.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.260
And until that time,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.640
universities had treated
emeritus faculty with contempt.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.710
They had pretty much ignored them.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.890
Once you were out of here,

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.653
you were out of sight, out of mind.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.673
In order to get them to leave,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.700
the superannuated people like me,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.550
they had to start coming up

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.970
with much better retirement packages

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.410
to reduce the exit costs from employment.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.880
They had to start treating
emeritus faculty better.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.410
They built a building where
they can have offices,

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.450
they gave them email accounts,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.840
So, if your exit costs are very high,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.610
you're much more vulnerable within a firm

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.600
than if your exit costs are low.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.600
And so some people even
argued, and I was one of them,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.940
that you might be able
to get business support

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.830
for a much more robust social wage,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.120
giving people benefits that
are not tied to their work,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.200
if you, on the other hand,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.440
also promise business less regulation.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.430
So, you'd say, "Well, if,"...

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.300
There were debates
about this, for example,

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.900
in the European Union that in countries

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.810
that didn't supply a lot
of worker protection,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.163
maybe the social chapter
should provide stronger,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.230
stronger appeals processes

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.920
when workers are abused and so on.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.540
And the idea was that
since what business wants

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.930
is flexibility at the plant level,

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.390
you could try and get business support

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.670
for a coalition to increase social wages,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.510
the quid for the quo being

00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:32.420
that they would get less
regulation in the workplace.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.420
It would be easier for
them to lay-off people

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.700
because it would be less
catastrophic for the people

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.210
and so on.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:43.330
And so I and others pushed
these kinds of arguments.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.300
The difficulty with them was
political, for the most part.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.300
That because of the declining
power of labor anyway,

00:25:52.652 --> 00:25:55.160
the notion that business had any incentive

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.070
to get behind these
proposals was pie in the sky.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.920
And so they were stillborn,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.803
and it's very difficult
to make the case today.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.910
It might, nonetheless, be
true that we should think

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.670
that UBIs now is an
idea has time has come.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.030
But why does it get so little support?

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.610
Now, you can get polls.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.530
You can run polls where you can get

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.300
48% of the American public to
say they're in favor of it,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.320
but they're standalone polls
that don't say anything

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.213
about the costs or how it would be funded.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.500
And if you look at efforts
to actually produce it,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.380
you find that people are very resistant

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.710
to this idea of writing checks to anyone

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.053
that are completely unrelated to work.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.343
Why might that be?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.235
Why might that be?

00:26:54.235 --> 00:26:55.779
- [Student] American work ethic.

00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:56.920
- Work, there's a work ethic.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.443
So, what is a work ethic?

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.680
(multiple students responding)

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.460
We must bootstrap ourselves up.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.850
This idea that people
get something for nothing

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.160
or that they haven't done,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.160
they haven't made the requisite
effort is extremely strong.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.110
It's something that political theorists

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.120
sometimes call the workmanship ideal,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.740
this idea that when you...

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.953
Working for something creates,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.930
it creates an entitlement over it,

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.590
and because you know that,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.240
it gives you the incentive to work hard.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.460
And, indeed, if you go back
to the John Rawls's argument

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.760
that I mentioned at the
outset, he realized,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.300
not surprisingly, he was
a very intelligent guy,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.030
he realized that his moral
arbitrariness argument

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.610
was sort of at war with
the work ethic, right?

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.570
Because if you say nature,
nurture doesn't matter,

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.723
however you got your
skills and capacities,

00:28:05.382 --> 00:28:06.630
it's all morally arbitrary.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.850
You don't deserve, none
of you Yale students

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.574
deserve to be here, right?

00:28:11.574 --> 00:28:12.407
There's no reason.

00:28:12.407 --> 00:28:14.700
You just got lucky.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.750
And you wanna say, "No, I
worked hard to get to Yale."

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.153
And so Rawls had a kind of cop out,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.150
that he said, "Well,
yeah, the distribution

00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:33.187
"of our capacities and
skills is morally arbitrary,

00:28:33.187 --> 00:28:37.390
"but the, what we choose
to do with them is not."

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.900
So, if one person decides
to work hard every day

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.510
and has got lots of Protestant work ethic,

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.940
and the other one sits on the
couch watching ESPN all day,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.360
then the one who worked choose,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.130
even if they have the same capacities,

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.390
the one that chooses to work harder

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.690
is deserving of their
differential benefit.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.150
But, of course, that and
two dollars and 75 cents

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.320
might get you a seat on
the New York City subway.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.330
Because the capacity
to use your capacities

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.060
is also morally arbitrary,
arbitrarily distributed.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.240
If one person has

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.770
parents who pump the work
ethic into them a mile a minute

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.050
and gets, teaches them, sits
and does homework with them

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.770
every night for 15 years and so on,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.810
that's very different from a parent

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.580
who's maybe in an alcoholic
daze, ignoring their children.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.830
And so the one child grows up

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.660
with the capacity to use their capacities

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.230
much better than the next person.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.960
And, indeed, maybe the
capacity to stick at things

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.980
even has a genetic component.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.980
Some people may be genetically
more able to focus,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.420
all the research on
attention deficit disorder

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.270
and all of that.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.010
So, Rawls's answer

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.240
is just a way of avoiding the
problem that he's identified.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.920
And so here's the funny thing about Rawls,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.370
and when I teach this in
political philosophy classes

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.230
we spend a lot more time on it,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.540
but what you find

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.160
is almost nobody can see anything wrong

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.780
with Rawls's moral arbitrariness argument

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.080
except for his cop out,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.033
which any smart student can
shred in a matter of minutes.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.660
But nobody really wants
to go all the way with it

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.330
because it threatens the very idea

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.020
of individual responsibility, right?

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.710
Because how can you hold
anyone responsible for anything

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.240
if even our capacity to behave responsibly

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.370
is distributed in morally arbitrary ways.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.240
And so even though it is true

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.880
that our capacities to do things

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.450
are distributed in morally arbitrary ways,

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.920
people don't like to live
with that implication.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.910
Even if it's true that some
people got a lot of help

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:13.030
from whoever it is,
Sunday School teachers,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.600
that other people didn't get

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.980
and more diligent parents and so on,

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.000
people do not want to live
with the implications of that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.650
And if you want a political
illustration of that,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.600
think back to the firestorm
in the 2012 election

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.370
when President Obama

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.370
took the Rawlsian position
without the Rawlsian cop out.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.110
- If you were successful,
somebody along the line

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.603
gave you some help.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.698
There was a great teacher
somewhere in your life.

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:50.270
(crowd cheering)

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.580
Somebody helped to create

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.820
this unbelievable American
system that we have

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.810
that allowed you to thrive.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.660
Somebody invested in roads and bridges.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.090
If you got a business,

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.200
that, you didn't build that.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.143
Somebody else made that happen.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.300
- So, all hell broke
loose, as you might recall.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.870
Here's just one of a million ads

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.893
you could've found in response.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.130
- To say that Steve
Jobs didn't build Apple,

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.020
that Henry Ford didn't build Ford Motor,

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.110
to say something like that
is not just foolishness,

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.260
it's insulting to every entrepreneur,

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.793
every innovator in
America, and it's wrong.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.510
- My father's hands
didn't build this company?

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.290
My hands didn't build this company?

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.810
My son's hands aren't
building this company?

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.460
Did somebody else take out
the loan on my father's house

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.950
to finance the equipment?

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.140
Does somebody else make payroll every week

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.800
and figure out where it's coming from?

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.430
President Obama, you're
killing us out here.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.080
Through hard work and
a little bit of luck,

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.760
we built this business.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.276
Why are you demonizing us for it?

00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:55.280
(energetic music)

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.130
We are the solution, not the problem.

00:32:58.531 --> 00:33:00.360
It's time we had somebody
who believes in us.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.790
Someone who believes that achievement

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.660
should be rewarded, not punished.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.843
We need somebody who believes in America.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.810
- So, it didn't turn out
to be Mitt Romney, this,

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:16.020
but it is a portent of
things to come because

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.600
this ad was used to reinforce

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.770
the perception of sort of
"Let them eat cake" elites,

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:31.770
that he was sitting there in
the comfort of the Oval Office,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.620
saying, "You didn't build that,"

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.963
and denying the efficacy
of the work effic,

00:33:41.129 --> 00:33:42.680
of the work ethic.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.320
And so you might say

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.170
it's a difficult case to make.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.917
Nonetheless, you might have thought,

00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:56.020
"I missed something here,"
because, as Andrew Yang says,

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.150
not only is he pushing this idea now

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.320
but he noted that people like

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.510
Charles Murray are supporting it

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.320
and, indeed, Milton Friedman has supported

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.980
a universal basic income since the 1970s.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.340
But they have a slightly
different thing in mind.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.820
So, here's Murray's

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.720
take on it.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.823
- The basics are this.

00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:28.493
At the age of 21,

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.840
every American starts to
receive a monthly deposit

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.840
electronically to a known
bank account of 13,000

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.793
divided by 12.

00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:43.990
13,000 is the total basic income,

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:46.920
of which 3,000 must be
devoted to healthcare.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.860
So, you have 10,000 of disposable.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.470
I think if we simply add that on

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:54.440
to the current benefit
system, it's not affordable,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.600
but what if it replaces everything else?

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.220
There's no more Medicare, no
more health, Social Security,

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.980
there's no more welfare, there's
no more corporate welfare,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.800
there's no more agricultural subsidies.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.940
I can go through the
whole list of transfers.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.330
There's none of that stuff

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.360
and there's also none of the bureaucracies

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.110
that administer it.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.160
You have $10,000.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.287
And you say, "Well, you
can't live on $10,000."

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.950
Well, if you really wanna
live all by yourself, no.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.770
You'll probably, you'll live a pretty

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.760
crubby existence on $10,000.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.650
You get a minimum wage job,

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.999
just a minimum wage job,

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:36.999
and you work 2,000 hours a
year at, let's say, 7.50,

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.950
that's $15,000 plus 10, that's $25,000.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:49.210
Yeah, that's well above,
way above the poverty line.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.610
Well, suppose for some
reason you can't work

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.650
or let's suppose you don't wanna work.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.063
You can still have a decent
existence if you're cooperative.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.203
If you're cooperative
enough to convince a friend,

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.690
a girlfriend or boyfriend, a relative,

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:08.730
or something else to pool your resources,

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.930
if you just do it with
two people, you got 20

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.260
with no working whatsoever.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.100
You got 30 if you got three people.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.590
You add a little bit of income

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.760
and you're in the middle class.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.520
That $10,000 given to everyone has a huge

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.620
effect on their ability
to live a decent existence

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.840
by doing reasonable things.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.980
Right now, we claw back
benefits at a very low rate,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.780
so that if you're on
food stamps and Medicare

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.193
and you take a job,

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.483
you very soon face a very
punitive loss of benefits.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.950
I say, look, you keep your entire 10,000.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.200
We don't claw back a cent of it

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.383
until you have 30,000 of earned income.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.690
- So, there you have it.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.850
The conservative case for
universal basic income

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:03.430
is something that would replace
the entire welfare state.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:08.250
And if you look at the way
this has been costed out,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.800
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.610
in Washington, DC, which is a think tank,

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.510
estimates that giving everybody a 12,000,

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:21.150
he says 13, taking three
out for medical care,

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.170
but at the 12,000 minimum wage

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.960
that somebody like Andrew Yang is pushing

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.017
would cost three trillion
dollars to fund per year.

00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:36.017
And even if you got rid of
Social Security and Medicare,

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.910
that would not be enough to fund it.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.810
And so if you start to think about

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.290
what would the political
coalition for this actually be,

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.750
it dissolves before your eyes

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.280
because the AARP would quickly

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.650
become a leader in the opposition to this.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.313
You could think about universe,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.150
hospitals, hospital interest
groups and administrators.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.230
All kinds of people,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.683
public interest groups
protecting welfare benefits,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.110
would rapidly start to oppose it.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:19.290
And it's also worth saying
that if you look at where

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.240
there have been efforts
to institute universal

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.850
unconditional basic incomes elsewhere,

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.020
they haven't fared much better.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.290
So, setting aside
something like the Alaska

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.880
sort of windfall benefit

00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:38.933
or the Norwegian,

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.470
the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.700
that's been funded by their oil,

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.730
which is a different idea.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.260
It's a sort of...

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.180
It's a sudden...

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.984
A sudden benefit occurs and
there's a notion to take,

00:38:56.984 --> 00:38:59.680
to spend it on the whole community.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.860
But if you think in general,

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.287
in Switzerland they had
a referendum on a UBI

00:39:04.287 --> 00:39:06.210
and it went down massively

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:11.210
and, by the way, was strongly
opposed by labor unions,

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.680
as you might suspect if
you start to think about it

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.590
because it would erode labor
unions' bargaining power.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.920
In Finland they had a modest experiment,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.590
a selected experiment with UBIs

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.570
to see what impact it would have

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.130
and abandoned it after a few years.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:35.050
So, the notion that even
though it might appear

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.860
that you could get a great deal of support

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.980
for a universal basic income

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.780
and it seems like it might
not be such a bad idea

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.993
from a variety of perspectives,

00:39:46.995 --> 00:39:51.510
I think that it's a tall order
to think your way through

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:56.120
a political coalition that
could effectively achieve

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.060
the kind of universal basic income

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.220
that most people would want

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.910
and be, certainly would
be willing to accept.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.660
Between its sort of frontal
assault on the work ethic

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.220
that many people regard as necessary to

00:40:15.574 --> 00:40:18.240
get people to be productive

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.020
and the fact that it would replace

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.120
some of the policies

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.620
that Americans are so
strongly attached to,

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.800
I think, Andrew Yang,
there's a good reason why

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.220
even though he made it
just into the debates,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.400
he's not really getting much
attention for this view.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.463
So, I wouldn't buy a lot
of stock in it right now.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.400
Let's talk about minimum wages.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.780
Of course, this doesn't
help with unemployment,

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.420
but it certainly would help
people who have been victims

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.373
of long-term wage stagnation.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.760
- The fight for a $15 an hour minimum wage

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.940
just netted its biggest
victories yet this week.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.230
Yesterday, lawmakers in
California voted for a bill

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:11.150
that will raise the state's
minimum wage to $15 by 2022.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.040
On Monday, Governor Jerry Brown

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.140
is expected to sign it into law.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.180
Last night, New York
governor Andrew Cuomo said

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.860
he reached a budget deal,

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.420
hiking the minimum to $15 in New York City

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.500
by the end of 2018.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.360
Suburbs and other parts of the state

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.980
would reach that level in 2021.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.910
The combined moves could affect

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.090
as many as 10 million workers.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.683
- You know by today,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.280
many of the CEOs of the companies

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.130
that we're fighting to get
the minimum wage increased on,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.730
they have earned as much in the first

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.270
couple of weeks in January

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:52.700
as they will pay these
employees for the whole year.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.743
That is not justice.
- That ain't right.

00:41:54.743 --> 00:41:56.697
- That ain't fair, that isn't right.

00:41:56.697 --> 00:42:01.697
And we don't begrudge anyone
their success and their income,

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:06.020
but we do begrudge
exploitation of the workers

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.180
to that extent.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.890
- 90% of Americans have not
had a raise for 40 years.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.430
- Pay your workers a living wage,

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.580
15 bucks an hour.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.393
- It is a fight for fair wages.

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:24.030
- And so we could find clips of every one

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:27.250
of the Democratic candidates now running

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.360
calling for increases in
the minimum wage, at least,

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.030
at least $15 an hour

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.393
being phased in or not.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:43.780
So, and this has been a constant
theme of American politics

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.720
that the Democratic party tends to fight

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.930
for increased minimum wages,

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.400
and there are efforts,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.400
constant efforts to increase
minimum wages in urban,

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.120
within city and state
legislatures as well.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.970
But there are a lot of difficulties

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.500
with minimum wages as
policy, when we think.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.830
It's very easy politics, as
you can see, to make that case,

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.430
at least from the perspective of

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.200
the base of the Democratic party.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.350
One question is, well, who actually pays

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.360
for increases in the minimum wage?

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.210
It might well be the case that

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:34.880
the cost of the increased wages

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.760
is simply passed on in
increased prices with the,

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.430
by the companies

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.640
that have to pay higher wages.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.290
And, indeed, there was a

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.910
interesting effort to raise minimum wages

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:56.430
in Los Angeles a couple of years ago,

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.010
and we did some interviewing of employers

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:03.090
because the local Employers
Association was supporting it,

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.440
and they reasoned two things.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.440
One was the money would be spent
in their stores in the city

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.691
so that it would come back,

00:44:12.691 --> 00:44:17.370
but also that it would be
possible to increase prices.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:21.880
So, it's not clear who
benefits in that sense.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.291
But more indirectly, if
you're thinking about

00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:30.163
what are the effects
gonna be on employment?

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:34.140
And here we have to think about

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.310
whether you'll get higher
minimum wages for some

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:45.200
at the expense of lower
employment in the economy overall.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.760
And in some counties, this
takes on very extreme forms.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.040
In contemporary South Africa,

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.630
as I think I have mentioned to you,

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.230
where they have very strong protection

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.970
of wages in the formal sector,

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.430
they have extremely high levels

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.580
of unemployment in the informal

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.260
and very different, much lower
wages in the informal sector.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.080
And, furthermore, they have

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.700
hemorrhaged jobs to places like Lesotho

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.050
and textile jobs even to China.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:22.030
And so there's a real cost, if you like,

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.040
of increasing minimum wages

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.910
from the standpoint of employment.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.250
And particularly now,

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.270
when we're thinking about the temptations

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.773
to go to automation,

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.230
raising minimum wages might have even

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:39.080
more deleterious effects on employment.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.720
I think I described to
you the Nike factory

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.980
I visited outside Ho Chi Min City,

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.380
and one of the notable
features of that Nike factory

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.480
was it was extremely labor intensive.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.650
They were using technology

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.080
that was maybe 30 or 40 years old.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.340
But the reason was that wages were low.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.310
If you start to ramp up wages,

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:05.360
the incentive to send more jobs to robots

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.370
will become stronger.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:12.060
So, the impulse to improve minimum wages

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.200
is completely understandable,

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.980
but it has these costs.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:21.840
Moreover, in a federal
system like we have here,

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.233
if you increase minimum
wages in one state,

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.660
it creates an incentive for

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.160
employers just to go to other states.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.890
Just as if you have strong
union contracts in one state,

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.303
such as the auto workers
unions in Michigan,

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:46.550
the employers can simply
move to Tennessee.

00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:49.870
So, that's, there's a kind of internal

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.010
race to the bottom problem.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.740
And if you have a federal
minimum wage, you can avoid that,

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.410
but only at the price of
contributing to outsourcing,

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.210
the flying geese problem and so on.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.190
In an era when capital is very mobile

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.850
and can produce things
in anywhere in the world,

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:12.150
propping up minimum wages in one place

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.790
is water flows around a rock

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.910
and it's just gonna flow somewhere else.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:21.893
So, it feels like a stop-gap solution.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.900
It's also worth pointing
out, on the politics front,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.210
how difficult increasing
the minimum wage is.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:31.940
For example, we talked earlier

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:35.340
about the estate tax in the US.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.580
When the estate tax was made permanent

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.470
in the 2013 legislation,

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.770
the threshold at which you pay
it was indexed for inflation,

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.090
so now it keeps going up.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.670
Nobody has ever managed
to index the minimum wage,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.680
and it has, that's why it
hasn't been put up for years.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.710
There's very powerful resistance,

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.960
and I think that reflects
the relative weakness

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.303
of organized labor

00:48:03.303 --> 00:48:08.303
in getting those kinds of
things entrenched, if you like.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.720
So, even if we get, we
have a five year campaign

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.470
to get the minimum wage to $15 an hour,

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.610
it probably will have been
eroded by inflation by then

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:22.150
and a new campaign will have to be,

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:26.230
have to be instituted
to get it raised again.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.063
The idea of

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.360
in 1988, Bill Bradley,

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.470
when running for the
Democratic nomination,

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.320
ran on the platform of
indexing the minimum wage

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.230
to the median income,
got nowhere politically.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.513
A very difficult sell.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.567
Now, you could say, "Well, okay,

00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:49.127
"so if there's a race to the bottom,

00:48:49.127 --> 00:48:52.473
"what we need to do is
raise the bottom," right?

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.560
And so can we think about
global minimum wage?

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.850
And there have been people
who have, and even movements,

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.013
that have committed themselves to this.

00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:07.350
A man called Sullivan,

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.430
who was famous for the Sullivan Principles

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:11.900
applied to American,

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.733
he was a pastor

00:49:12.733 --> 00:49:14.820
and the Sullivan Principles were applied

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.450
to American corporations doing business

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.730
in apartheid South Africa.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.500
And the Sullivan Principles were,

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.450
they tried to force all the multinationals

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.580
operating in South Africa to say

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.660
they wouldn't do business in South Africa

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.610
except on these terms,

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.810
which defied some of the
worst features of apartheid.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.380
They were quite successful.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:42.330
He subsequently got behind
various other campaigns

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.400
to drive up wages in very poor countries.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.290
And, of course, there's
some precedent for this.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.660
If you look at the ILO,

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.970
the International Labor Organization,

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.423
they have created
international labor standards,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.710
and, for example, in the 1984 Trade Act,

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.340
the federal government said they will not

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.530
trade with countries

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.790
that don't meet certain labor standards.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:12.623
In the...

00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:17.410
When the Bush admin, the
Bush Senior administration

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.630
negotiated the NAFTA agreement

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.550
and then Clinton came in,

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:25.780
it's true that he signed the legislation,

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.090
but not before so-called
labor side agreements

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.230
had been added to the, to NAFTA

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.570
which said that countries had to meet

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.940
certain minimum wage and labor standards

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.600
if they were going to trade,

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.880
sell their products in the US.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.960
And so there are these efforts,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.540
and they often involve sort
of publicity campaigns.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.280
There was huge publicity attacks on Nike

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.540
for their labor practices

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.800
in sweatshops in Malaysia and elsewhere

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.020
that actually had a pretty good effect

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.250
on Nike jacking up their wages,

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:10.220
and Nike became an advocate
of pushing for increases

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.793
in global minimum wages.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.530
And I, in an earlier book,

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.990
spent some time exploring
the prospects for this,

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.400
but they're very, very difficult
to achieve politically.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.410
And even in poor countries,

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.980
they can have deleterious
employment effects

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.720
if the country's sufficiently poor.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.170
So, it's not that it's a,

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.150
it's not that it's a terrible idea,

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.920
but if you start to think about building

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.970
and sustaining coalitions
that gonna be able to do this

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:45.333
in an era of highly mobile capital,

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:50.320
again, it's not an idea that is likely

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.420
to have much effect.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.080
And certainly, if you look
at the amount by which

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.260
minimum wages have been increased

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.300
as a result of these
campaigns in countries

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.300
in East Asia and Southeast
Asia, they're minuscule

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.760
from a perspective of having
any effect on American wages.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.480
It's very unlikely that
they'll be able to do that.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.023
So, this is the difficulty
with minimum wages.

00:52:21.023 --> 00:52:22.670
It's an idea that

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.360
is obviously appealing.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.460
It's very, it's an easy soundbite.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.010
You see all these Democratic
candidates running on it.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.230
But in terms of having an actual impact,

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.640
it seems like it's not gonna do very much,

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.510
and it's certainly not gonna affect

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.023
the stability of employment.

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:50.130
So, let's talk about the
Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:55.630
This is a much less well
known about phenomenon

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.130
and although ideas of this kind

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.010
have been around for a long time.

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.070
Indeed, in Britain in the 19th century,

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.640
there was a poor law system
called the Speenhamland system,

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.140
which was essentially a
subsidy of very low wages

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.600
to keep people out of poverty.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.530
So, it's a subsidy to business,

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.100
but it's paid to the worker, okay?

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.410
That's how the Earned
Income Tax Credit works.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:28.010
And, interestingly, it was signed into law

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.233
by President Ford in 1975,

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.250
although it had begun its life
in the Nixon administration

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.980
and he had been overtaken
by events, but...

00:53:38.818 --> 00:53:40.210
(students laughing)

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.630
The program survived, nonetheless,

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.030
and it started out very small.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.270
So, the first Earned Income
Tax Credit worked like this.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:51.680
You got a 10% credit

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.130
for the first $4,000
of your earned income,

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:59.050
and it then was phased out after $8,000.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.340
So, the idea was that if your credit

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.430
exceeded the amount of tax you owed,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.190
the government would write you a check

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:10.450
for the difference, right?

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:13.550
So, this is the idea of the
Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:17.430
That's, economists say it is refundable.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.320
That's what a refundable credit means,

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.670
that if it falls below zero,
you don't stop getting it.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:26.300
The government actually writes you a check

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.960
for the difference.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.900
And so it took a lot of people
off the tax rolls entirely,

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.350
and then people would
start to get a check.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:38.507
Now, you might say, "Well,
the numbers were so small."

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.520
Furthermore, originally it was for

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.963
single mothers with children only,

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.910
but here we should call back

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.170
the language approximate goals

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.340
that I talked about last time.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.950
A very important book called
"The Hidden Welfare State"

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:02.950
by a man called Christopher
Howard was published in 1985,

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.180
in which he talked about the
world of tax expenditures.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.680
This is a classic expenditure.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.390
It's not seen as a transfer
payment in the budget.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:16.480
It's called a tax expenditure.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.700
It's an expenditure
through the tax system.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.010
Even though the great majority of it

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:24.580
is the government actually
writing checks to people,

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.270
it's not tax refunds

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.893
because of the refundable character of it.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.750
So, "The Hidden Welfare State"

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:36.330
is the world of tax expenditures,

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.840
and his book

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.360
gives chapter and verse
of the little-known truth

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.280
that the hidden welfare state

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.600
is actually as big as the welfare state,

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.500
as the visible welfare state.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.200
Because what tends to
happen with tax expenditures

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.710
is that they start out small
and then they grow over time,

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.970
and so it's a kind of get,

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:03.070
don't worry that it's small to begin with.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:06.510
Get your foot in the door
in the dark, as it were,

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:11.383
and then push to open
the door further later.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.683
And an interesting feature is that the,

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:23.110
the EITC has had strong
bipartisan support from Republican

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.790
and Democratic administrations

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:30.490
and has been expanded numerous times.

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:34.660
By 2017, it was costing
the federal government

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.170
more than 70 billion in wage subsidies

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.990
to more than 25 million families,

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.150
and it doesn't now phase out
completely until $50,000,

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.520
which is above the median income.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.840
So, it's 25 million families.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.150
You're talking about 100
million people probably,

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:56.690
close to it,

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.400
are being supported, in some measure,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.410
by the Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.580
They're either getting a tax deduction

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.550
or they're actually getting a check

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.990
from the federal government.

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:10.761
Now, this is...

00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:13.223
This is not chump change, right?

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.800
Another feature of it
that is very appealing

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.420
is that it's very cheap to administer.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.280
You don't need a new,

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.360
you don't need a new
bureaucracy to administer it.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.393
It's administered,
basically, by the IRS, right?

00:57:29.444 --> 00:57:32.130
You don't need a whole department

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.053
of the Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.960
So, that's an additional

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:43.350
feature of it.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.670
And also, it has a very interesting

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:49.640
set of incentives attached to it,

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.180
which is, unlike a minimum wage

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.090
which creates the incentive
of race to the bottom,

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:58.450
this actually creates an
incentive of the race to the top.

00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:03.450
Because if you have state
EITCs, as many states do,

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.420
what's gonna happen is if you, if

00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:11.630
a particular state offers a better,

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:16.405
a more generous EITC than a
different state, all else equal,

00:58:16.405 --> 00:58:19.290
the company will move to the state

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.240
that has the better EITC benefit

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.610
because it's a wage subsidy.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:27.730
It's a wage subsidy but it's,

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:30.190
so it's making things
cheaper for employers

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.810
and so it can be a magnet

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.900
for firms rather than

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.340
a disincentive for firms to

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.160
move into your state.

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.700
So, this is a hugely
appealing feature of it

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.630
from the standpoint of
avoiding the race to the bottom

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:53.593
and, on the contrary, creating
an opposite incentive.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:57.010
Another desirable feature of it

00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:01.190
is that while it is a subsidy to the firm,

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.343
it's paid directly to the worker.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:07.590
And if you think about that rather than,

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:10.120
say if you look at the infrastructure bill

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.300
that the Congress adopted last year

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.300
with tax breaks for firms
that invest in infrastructure,

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.570
one of the stock critiques
is it's very difficult

00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:27.030
to make sure they actually
make those investments

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.453
in the infrastructure.

00:59:29.433 --> 00:59:33.220
They do the planning in
R&amp;D and the planning,

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.100
and there's money paid to consultants,

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.080
and maybe they do it or maybe they don't.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.030
Or if you think about
place-based incentives

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.660
to firms to move to different areas,

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:50.923
there's lots of criticism of
them by economists that they,

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.610
that they lead to a lot of clientelism

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.140
and corruption and so on.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:02.320
When your payment is going
straight to the worker,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.870
there's no, there's a much
smaller possibility of that.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.240
Now, economists will still object

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.210
that this is distorting labor markets,

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:15.840
and some people think
it's morally obnoxious

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.243
because it's giving firms
incentives to pay lower wages,

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.400
and it does give firms
incentives to pay lower wages.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.360
Nonetheless, you can
see the potential here

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.820
for a coalition.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.620
And, indeed, business has tended to like

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.030
the Earned Income Tax Credit.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.140
I think that it's one reason why

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.350
Republicans have tended to get behind it.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:43.740
And certainly in the last decade,

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:48.630
the increases in the EITC
are by far the biggest

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:52.770
increase in downward
redistribution that we have seen

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.743
at the hands of the federal government.

01:01:00.263 --> 01:01:04.760
This is, I think, genuinely is an idea

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.020
that has time has come,

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.310
and you should think about

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:13.824
the likely expansion of the EICT,

01:01:13.824 --> 01:01:17.360
EITC as a way of

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.260
generating employment and increasing wages

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.010
that is going to have

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.280
more rather than less

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.193
of a future.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.950
Of course, it is, the
other reason Republicans

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:35.490
are willing to get onboard with it

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.510
is that it's linked to work.

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.610
There's no, this is unlike the,

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.080
unlike unconditional basic income.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.480
You only get it if you actually work.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.620
Nonetheless, employers can keep wages low,

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.390
knowing that they're gonna get the subsidy

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.873
for providing the employment.

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:57.540
So, I wanted to spend
our final few minutes

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:02.520
talking about unemployment
and adjustment assistance.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.560
Again, I think an extremely
important set of policies

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.323
in view of the,

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.820
the insecurity of insistence.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.210
Now, unemployment insurance
in America is a very,

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:21.800
has a very depressing history.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.610
If you go back to the
Social Security Act of 1935,

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.980
there was a lot of talk at that time

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.010
of creating a national
unemployment insurance system

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.710
based on a tax you pay when employed,

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:39.730
but there was a strong body of opinion

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:42.580
that said the Supreme
Court would strike it down

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.560
as unconstitutional for technical reasons

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.110
that needn't concern us.

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:50.890
So, instead what we got
was unemployment legis...

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:53.870
The unemployment system was created

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.570
as part of the Social Security Act,

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.360
but essentially it's a kind of

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.970
unfunded mandate on the states,

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.400
and all the federal government
supplied was some guidelines

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.300
and some administrative support,

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.270
and in particularly extreme circumstances

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:14.040
such as the Depression or
after the financial crisis,

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.370
the government, the federal government

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:17.800
will make lump sum contributions

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.590
to sort of prop up unemployment
insurance in the states.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.820
But basically, it's a state-based system.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.460
And that immediately has
one very bad feature,

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.470
which is state legislators do not want

01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:38.860
to have very generous
unemployment insurance

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.500
because they worry about the race to them.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.520
They don't wanna be paying it

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.690
and so there's a lot of
resistance at the state level.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:52.280
The benefits that they
create, state unemploy,

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.250
they're often very short-term,

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:57.500
they replace about 40% of prior earnings,

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.773
and they mostly don't keep
people out of poverty.

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.780
There's particularly low
coverage for low income workers,

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:09.810
so it's not a good country
in which to be unemployed.

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:14.810
And, indeed, the short-term
character of the support,

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.873
the hurdles to getting it,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.210
and the prevalence of
longer-term unemployment

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:26.090
I was telling about in an earlier lecture

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.180
may mean that in 2016,

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.240
only about a quarter of
the unemployed workers

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.800
in America were receiving benefits,

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.810
down from over a third

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.650
in 2007, so, you see there the effects

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:43.340
of the long-term unemployment

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.430
and the difficulties of getting it.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:48.040
And also another thing that's happening is

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.700
that more and more long-term unemployment,

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.680
employed workers are
just choosing to go onto

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.900
Social Security disability benefits.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.520
Applications for disability
insurance have skyrocketed,

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.020
so they're leaving the
workforce permanently.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.380
Again, it's a very costly solution

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:12.073
to the problem.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.830
And because the wages that are taxed

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:19.320
to fund unemployment
benefits, there's a cap,

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.630
it's also a very
regressively financed system.

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:27.130
So, the unemployment insurance in America

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.890
is never been robust,

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.890
it's difficult to get,
and it's failing badly

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.923
I think is about the best
that you can say of it.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:42.190
But there's a more
interesting set of programs

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:45.330
that I wanna end by
spending a little bit of,

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.560
a few minutes talking about,

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.710
and this, this is the idea that was known

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:52.453
as trade adjustment insurance,

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.160
trade adjustment assistance,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.920
and it was a missed opportunity
politically for the,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.920
because of the way in
which it came to be enacted

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:08.000
and then implemented.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So, it was adopted in the
Kennedy Administration in 1962.

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:16.390
This was an era of trade deregulation,

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.990
not unlike the era in the post-Cold War,

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.440
and the Kennedy administration
really wanted to

01:06:23.601 --> 01:06:27.780
get trade agreements with other
countries to improve trade.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:31.150
And the unions were a lot
stronger then than they are now,

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:35.310
and the way the administration
got the unions to support it

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:40.150
was to get behind this idea of
trade adjustment assistance.

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.610
And it was gonna be...

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:48.350
It was going to be robust
unemployment insurance

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.580
coupled with

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:56.100
funds to support relocation
and free retraining.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.200
And so the AF-of-L-CIO supported it.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.530
They supported the Free
Trade Act on the grounds

01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:07.300
that this would be the quid
for the quo, if you like,

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.453
to use the language of the week.

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:14.530
That we would start to get
this adjustment assistance

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.560
paid to workers.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.740
They would get better unemployment,

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.917
longer-term unemployment support,

01:07:19.917 --> 01:07:22.720
and they would get support to relocate,

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.550
and they would get

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.703
free retraining to
re-enter the workforce in,

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.320
in another occupation.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.133
It was a huge administrative catastrophe.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.410
President Kennedy was assassinated,

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.880
and when the Johnson
administration came in,

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.760
they had different priorities,

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.150
and they were doing civil rights,

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:49.310
they were doing voting rights,

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:51.800
they were preoccupied
with the Vietnam War,

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.650
so this was not a high
priority of the administration,

01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:00.650
and they didn't set up an
effective implementing strategy

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.010
for this program.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.480
And so throughout the 1960s,

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:09.480
actually, not a single claim
for trade adjustment assistance

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.490
was actually funded.

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:17.490
And business had been very
skeptical of this program

01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:19.320
and had not really supported it,

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.800
but as the 1960s wore on

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.680
and the desire for free
trade agreements in

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:28.980
many sectors got stronger,

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:33.083
business decided that
they liked this idea.

01:08:34.230 --> 01:08:38.890
But by then, the AF-of-L-CIO had concluded

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:42.650
they had been so badly
burned that George Meany,

01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:46.890
who was it's head and who had
actually championed the idea,

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.450
he rechristened it burial insurance,

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:54.450
and the unions have since
opposed all free trade measures.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.640
And so it's really a lost opportunity

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.600
because it was the one
time in American history

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.040
that American unions had actually been

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.633
in favor of free trade.

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.360
A real lost opportunity.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.170
And this is an idea that
has really taken hold

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:15.420
in some other countries.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.040
The gold standard here is Denmark,

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:23.040
which supplies 60% of your
lost wages for three years

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.590
plus huge amounts of retraining

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:30.530
for workers to re-enter the workforce.

01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:32.230
Very tailored to individuals.

01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:35.303
They spend a lot of resources on it.

01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:40.570
This to is an area where

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.960
we argue in "The Wolf at the Door"

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.363
is an idea whose time has come,

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.230
but it has to be rethought
in the following,

01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:53.320
I'll just finish with this,

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.130
has to be rethought in the following way.

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:59.050
One of the problems with it was that

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.410
the unions had a lot of
trouble supporting it,

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.780
not only because they had
thought they had been burned

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.117
but they said, "Why
should we only help people

01:10:08.117 --> 01:10:10.350
"who've lost their jobs to trade?"

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:12.670
Indeed, one of the reasons
it was so hard to get it

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.880
was you had to prove you'd
lost your job due to trade

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.080
rather than for some other reason.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.527
They said, "That's unfair

01:10:19.527 --> 01:10:22.107
"because what about industries
where people lose jobs

01:10:22.107 --> 01:10:23.790
"that are not due to trade?"

01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:25.920
And, indeed, in the Reagan administration

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.110
when they decided to essentially
underfund the program

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:31.480
so much as to effectively kill it,

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.340
Reagan made exactly the same argument.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.907
He said, "It's arbitrary
just to help people

01:10:36.907 --> 01:10:39.300
"who've lost jobs to trade."

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.740
Well, in our era,

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.490
where jobs are probably
increasingly going to technology,

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:48.210
as we have heard about,
it should be re-conceived

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.380
as universal adjustment assistance,

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.610
and I think it would
be much easier to build

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:58.550
and sustain the coalition to protect it.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.020
So, what business should fear

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:03.530
if they don't get behind
these kind of proposals

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.609
is that Andrew Yang will
turn out to have been right.

01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:07.770
(students laughing)

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:09.370
And just, we'll let...

01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:12.170
I'll leave you with this

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.770
epitaph on the 2016 election,

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.910
and I won't tell you who said it

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:20.360
until after I've read it to you.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.730
Trump's election wasn't about Trump.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:24.460
It was a throbbing middle finger

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.960
in the face of America's ruling class.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.890
It was a gesture of
contempt, a howl of rage,

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:34.050
the end result of decades of
selfish and unwise decisions

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.570
made by selfish and unwise leaders.

01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:40.340
Happy countries don't elect
Donald Trump president.

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.530
Desperate ones do.

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:44.810
In retrospect, the lesson seems obvious.

01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:48.630
Ignore voters for long enough
and you'll get Donald Trump.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:50.860
Yet the people at whom
the message was aims

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:51.940
never received it.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.740
Instead of pausing, listening,
thinking, and changing,

01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:00.740
America's ruling class withdrew
into a defensive crouch,

01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:03.003
beginning on election night.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.685
Well, that's enough of it.

01:12:06.685 --> 01:12:09.410
We're out of time but it's Tucker Carlson.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.343
You might be surprised to know.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.050
All right, we will see
you after next week.

01:12:18.148 --> 01:12:20.731
(bright music)

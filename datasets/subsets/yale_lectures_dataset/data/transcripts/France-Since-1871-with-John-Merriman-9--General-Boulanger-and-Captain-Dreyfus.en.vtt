00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.745
Professor John Merriman:
I want today to talk about

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:09.740
two very well known crises in
the Third Republic.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.533
One is the Boulanger Affair and
the second is the more well

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:21.065
known, the Dreyfus Affair.
And I guess what makes the

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:26.011
Dreyfus Affair even more
poignant is that Alfred

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:31.272
Dreyfus's granddaughter died at
Auschwitz, in 1944,

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:35.290
I think.
So, and the context for this is

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.164
to--most of the time I'm going
to talk about the Boulanger

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:42.753
Affair,
and in a way that sets up the

00:00:42.753 --> 00:00:45.384
Dreyfus Affair,
because the Dreyfus Affair is

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:48.682
more well known.
But I agree with the

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:54.305
interpretation that views the
Boulanger Affair as the

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:58.630
emergence of the far Right in
France,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.139
events that parallel,
for example,

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:08.412
the rise of the far Right in
Austria, and in other places as

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:11.218
well,
and particularly the sort of

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.726
propaganda campaign,
the anti-Semitism,

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:17.421
and the sort of street thug
tactics are rather similar to

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:21.250
movements that we would become
all too familiar with,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.640
not personally of course,
but in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.420
So, that's what I want to talk
about today.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.486
And the background of this is,
of course, the rise of

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.911
anti-Semitism.
World War I unleashed the

00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:36.815
demons of the twentieth century
to a great extent,

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:42.579
there's no question about that.
For Adolf Hitler it transformed

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.110
his anti-socialism and
subsequent anti-communism into a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.263
frenzy,
but it added the dimension that

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:55.900
was the most pernicious aspect
of his horrible existence,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.784
which was anti-Semitism.
But anti-Semitism was already

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:01.520
out there.
And Karl Lueger,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.010
who was the mayor of Vienna,
said, "I decide who's a Jew,"

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.815
and the old liberal Vienna sort
of disappeared in this sort of

00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:15.116
frenzy of anti-Semitism.
Well, anti-Semitism

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:18.618
was--characterized,
unfortunately,

00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:22.952
many centuries in Europe,
and certainly the Third

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:25.737
Republic did not invent
anti-Semitism in France,

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:28.819
either.
There were riots against Jews

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.067
after 1848.
One of the members of the

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.650
Committee of Public Safety in
the French Revolution,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.426
who was from Alsace,
where there were lots of Jews,

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.370
was extraordinarily
anti-Semitic,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.385
and all of this is sadly known.
But certainly the political

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:51.552
dimensions of anti-Semitism in
the '80s and '90s help explain

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:55.870
the intensity of these two big
affairs.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.929
And for the Dreyfus Affair,
it was so important and so

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.527
wrenching that people simply
referred to it as

00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:05.818
l'affaire,
the affair, because it was

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:12.449
so--it preoccupied dinner-table
discussions and brawls,

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.202
political newspapers and
everything else for a very long

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:19.892
time.
Now, in addition to the sort of

00:03:19.892 --> 00:03:24.141
growth of anti-Semitism,
continued growth,

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:28.958
in France and other places,
the other part of the context

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.199
that needs to be briefly
explained has two dimensions.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.684
First, there was the question
of revenge, of vengeance,

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:43.778
of the recapture of Alsace and
the parts of Lorraine that had

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:49.096
been so rudely snatched away.
It's possible to exaggerate,

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.819
of course, the impact,
as one of my former students,

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.559
Rachel Chrastil has argued,
of revengisme,

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:04.298
revenge thinking,
on French political life in the

00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:09.130
1870s and 1880s.
But by the end of the 1880s it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.035
still is an important part in
political thinking,

00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:16.939
and Boulanger's campaign
reflected that fact.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.221
And the second is that--the
second sort of aspect of

00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.671
background is the perceived
weakness of the republican

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:30.036
government in that in order to
protect France against

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:33.351
Caesarism;
which, I've explained before,

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:36.477
was the fear of,
who knows, another Napoleon or

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:40.080
some sort of strong leader
riding a horse and starting

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.235
wars,
or repressing their own people,

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:46.989
rather like Napoleon III had
done--they create a

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:51.781
constitutional framework that
invests power in the Chamber of

00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.980
Deputies,
basically.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.517
And the Chambre des
Députés is a

00:04:56.517 --> 00:04:58.829
political club,
which I've said before,

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:02.295
and the same members are often
returned year after year,

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:06.725
the same bribes are given,
big casks of wine or barrels of

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:10.937
wine are put up near a voting
booth and everything

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:15.923
proceeds--at least this is in
the popular imagination--as a

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:20.050
political club of swinging door
ministries.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.976
And certainly if you look at,
just take 1889 to 1893--and

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:30.079
you're not responsible for this
because basically who cares

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:35.006
about these details--but there
are 546 different sessions

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:41.089
between 1889 and 1893,
873 bills introduced;

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.915
between '93 and '98 there are
633 sessions with 1,112 bills,

00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:52.740
with the government presenting
on its own well over 2000.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.941
But, in fact,
if you look at the

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:57.995
accomplishments,
besides providing a certain

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:00.964
stability,
the accomplishments seem to be

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:04.847
rather pale when you've got
people, both on the Left and the

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:07.547
Right,
saying that the big issue is

00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:11.178
over there;
and over there is in the east

00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:16.259
of what had been France,
that is Alsace and Lorraine,

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.636
and--because each bill had to
be discussed by a whole

00:06:19.636 --> 00:06:22.709
commission of deputies,
and it went on and on,

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:25.610
commissions become sort of
mini-ministries.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.617
The perception is that this is
an impotent system,

00:06:29.617 --> 00:06:33.952
it's an impotent system,
that's condemned France to be

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:36.279
less than virile.
And remember,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.906
this is the time when the
population--people are becoming

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:41.767
very afraid of the fact that the
population is not reproducing

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:46.576
itself.
So, this is one of the big

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:52.129
images of simply--of
instability.

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.420
And it's the same people,
it's the same ministries that

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.074
are reconstituted,
rather like Italian politics

00:07:00.074 --> 00:07:03.569
and much of the post-World World
II Era.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.810
There were 180 ministries
between 1870 and 1940,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.940
and the average tenure is about
three years.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.115
But that's really not much.
But yet, I mean,

00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:22.151
this is to exaggerate because
the Third Republic does provide

00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:25.110
stability for all of these great
affairs.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.149
The Republic survives these two
big affairs.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.228
The Republic raises enough
money to pay off the indemnity

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:34.850
to the newly formed German
Empire,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:40.033
but people react as to what
they're thinking and not

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:46.131
necessarily the reality of the
people who are looking at this

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.486
deeper.
So, thus the Boulanger Affair,

00:07:49.486 --> 00:07:52.469
or the crisis,
is more--let's call it the

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:56.719
Boulanger Crisis and the Dreyfus
Affair is better--is more

00:07:56.719 --> 00:08:03.372
significant than the events,
which are interesting in their

00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:05.508
own way.
And, of course,

00:08:05.508 --> 00:08:08.143
the other background,
as I said the other day,

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:11.949
or the other context are these
political crises of corruption,

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:16.490
which in our country we are all
too familiar with as well,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.190
the Panama Crisis and the sale
of Légion d'honneur by

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.250
the president's son-in-law,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.289
But this kind of frustration
then builds up an

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:33.059
anti-parliamentarian movement in
France,

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:38.229
and the temptation of trying to
find a strong man who will right

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:43.070
this wrong and who will reattach
the right arm of France,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:48.141
Alsace and Lorraine, to France.
The General Ferry,

00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:50.361
whom you've read about,
Jules Ferry,

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.913
he wrote in 1885 that "the
general impression is that the

00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:56.450
Republic is at the end of its
rope.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.973
Next year we will have
revolutionary excesses again and

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:03.549
then a violent reaction.
What will come out of this?

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:07.698
Surely some sort of
dictatorship"--the feeling that

00:09:07.698 --> 00:09:11.939
the government was powerless.
Now, a guy called Paul

00:09:11.939 --> 00:09:16.719
Déroulède creates
in May of 1882 the League of the

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:20.161
Patriots.
He called himself a simple bell

00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:22.937
ringer for this
anti-parliamentary,

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:27.769
ultra nationalistic movement.
And it quickly has 182,000

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:32.634
members, which is a phenomenal
amount, and there are great

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:37.500
echoes of aggressive patriotism,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:44.600
And with this began the rapidly
rising career of General Georges

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.588
Boulanger, who was born in 1837,
the son of a Breton farmer and

00:09:51.588 --> 00:09:55.659
a Welsh mother.
He had fought in four

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:59.059
campaigns, he was wounded six
times.

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:03.019
He was lucky in that he wasn't
killed.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:07.826
He was wounded during the Paris
Commune but before the great

00:10:07.826 --> 00:10:12.086
reprisals took place;
so he wasn't identified with

00:10:12.086 --> 00:10:15.929
the massacre of ordinary people.
The campaigns,

00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:19.091
he'd fought in Africa,
he'd fought in Italy,

00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:23.135
and he'd fought in Vietnam,
or what they called in those

00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:27.280
days Indo-China.
He was a brave, heroic figure.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.129
He cut a mean image on a horse;
he was a good horseman.

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:40.149
He wasn't very bright but that
never hurt him at all.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:43.789
He received one promotion after
another.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:46.482
He's the head of a whole
military division at the age of

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:48.440
forty-eight, which is extremely
young.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.764
He had lots of energy but,
as I said, not many brains and

00:10:51.764 --> 00:10:54.139
no particular talent for
organization,

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:59.766
but he fit the image of what
many people in France who were

00:10:59.766 --> 00:11:05.102
fed up with the Republic
believed that they--that France

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:07.480
needed.
He was sent to the U.S.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.362
(that is, this place) at
Yorktown, in order to represent

00:11:12.362 --> 00:11:16.800
France at the centennial of
essentially the British

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.440
surrender in the American
Revolution,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.361
and he caused a stir by
refusing to leave the ship on

00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:28.887
which he'd arrived in America
until they took down the German

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:32.960
flags that were also being flown
at the same time.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.542
And it's precisely the '80s,
when the mass press is

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:40.177
developing in France.
And so these are just fabulous

00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:42.364
gros titres,
big headlines,

00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:45.159
in the newspaper.
So, he becomes part of the

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.815
chouchoux,
he becomes kind of the darling

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.850
of a press which is dominated
by,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.287
as always in France,
by the rightwing press because

00:11:53.287 --> 00:11:56.312
of big money,
as is the case traditionally in

00:11:56.312 --> 00:11:59.750
the United States and other
countries as well.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.243
But he's on good terms with
Clemenceau, who was the

00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:09.272
republican par excellence.
Both had graduated from the

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:12.994
same high school,
or lycée,

00:12:12.994 --> 00:12:16.529
in Nantes, on the edge of
Brittany.

00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:20.589
He shared Clemenceau's residual
or at least inherent

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:24.251
anti-clericalism,
and that's something he would

00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:28.629
temper later as he's going after
rightwing support.

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:32.706
He became the Director of the
Infantry at the War Office and

00:12:32.706 --> 00:12:36.990
his superiors noted that he had
a taste for clumsy intrigue,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.393
and complained about the
civilians, or the pekins,

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:43.180
as they were called,
the Peking people,

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.403
the civilians,
and they were treated with

00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:50.119
contempt by the military;
and of course the rule in the

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:53.190
French Army, really all the way
through to the Algerian War,

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.166
has been this tension between
the officer corps,

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:58.509
very, very rightwing,
and the civilian

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:02.309
population--thus the attempts to
kill de Gaulle himself,

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:07.090
in the time of the Algerian
situation.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:13.205
And, so, he as an operator--and
he was that--he took every

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:19.320
possible opportunity to be seen
in front of his troops.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.552
He welcomed recruits with
military music as well as with

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:28.773
the Marseillaise.
It was his idea to paint all

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:32.049
the sentry boxes red,
white and blue.

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:36.507
And he at one point had been
insulted by somebody in the

00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:41.208
Chamber of Deputies and he
fights a duel (and people fought

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:45.666
duels a lot then) and his
adoring public forgave him for

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:49.800
the fact that his gun actually
didn't go off,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.941
and that nobody was hurt.
In 1886, during the Strike of

00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:59.910
Decazville, he did a very clever
thing, in one of those sound

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.139
bytes before there were sound
bytes.

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:06.296
Somebody said,
"what do you think about the

00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:10.279
strike in Decazville,
of the miners in Decazville?"

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:13.870
And he replied,
"at this very moment French

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.000
soldiers are sharing their
rations with striking workers."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.930
It was perfect.
And, so, he gets the support,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.378
at least in the early days,
of many workers who could

00:14:27.378 --> 00:14:32.510
imagine a kind of Napoleonic
figure who could at least talk a

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.913
good game of caring about them,
even though he really didn't at

00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:41.225
all.
On the 14th of July,

00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:46.020
1886, all eyes are on him,
and they start writing songs

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.315
about him: "our brave general,
Boulanger, who will bring back

00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:56.612
Alsace and Lorraine."
He is called General Victory,

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:59.826
fairly soon.
One of the lines goes,

00:14:59.826 --> 00:15:03.868
"look at him over there,
he's smiling at us as he passes

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:07.351
us by;
he has just brought us back

00:15:07.351 --> 00:15:12.615
Lorraine and Alsace."
And, so, the German situation,

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:18.250
tensions with the German Empire
increase his popularity.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.017
Bismarck himself,
that is Otto von Bismarck,

00:15:23.017 --> 00:15:29.669
the cagey chancellor of the
second Reich was aware of him,

00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:36.459
and he uses Boulanger's
popularity for his own internal

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:40.391
benefit in Germany,
saying, "when France has any

00:15:40.391 --> 00:15:42.789
reason to believe that she is
stronger than we are,

00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:46.700
on that day I believe that war
is certain."

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:52.704
And one of the few ways
of--that the Reichstag had in

00:15:52.704 --> 00:15:58.190
trying to reign in the Kaiser,
arguably, was attempting to

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.909
have some control over military
budgets.

00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:05.919
So, Bismarck uses him very
effectively.

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:12.831
And then there's a spy crisis
that's terribly uninteresting,

00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:17.227
and it helps Boulanger.
So, this begins to scare

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:20.408
people, and Jules Grévy,
whose son was the one

00:16:20.408 --> 00:16:23.650
implicated in the sale of
Légion d'honneur,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.690
says that he's got to go.
Well, what do you do with him?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.409
You can't really make him a
martyr.

00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:35.220
If you make him a martyr then
it looks like he--who knows?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.320
Maybe there'll be some sort of
a coup d'état attempt.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.353
He is not allowed to run for
office because he's still in the

00:16:41.353 --> 00:16:44.715
army, but as a write-in
candidate he gets something

00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:48.480
like--he gets 39,000 votes,
which is a large amount.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.639
And, so, the government says,
"let's get rid of him before

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:54.376
the next July^( )14th,
so he can't ride his horse down

00:16:54.376 --> 00:16:55.919
the Champs-Elysées
again."

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:59.977
And, so, they send him
to--decide to send him to

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:02.740
Clermont-Ferrand,
in Auvergne,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.822
and he's supposed to leave from
the Gare de Lyon,

00:17:05.822 --> 00:17:08.069
on the train,
on the 8th of July,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.314
and huge crowds start singing,
"tout à

00:17:10.314 --> 00:17:12.660
l'Élysée" that is
seize power,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.262
and they block the tracks.
It's the first case that I know

00:17:16.262 --> 00:17:20.041
of, of people actually
physically blocking railroad

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:23.140
tracks as a sign of political
protest.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.169
And they're singing the
Marseillaise also which is--for

00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:29.029
one thing it's the song of the
French Revolution,

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:31.758
but you have this sort of mix,
because you've got this old

00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:34.821
sort of Jacobin,
"we'll take what we want"

00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:39.930
attitude, mixing with this sort
of anti-republican Right;

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.090
and Boulanger seems like
somebody who could please

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.811
everybody.
In the early days he

00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:47.327
gets--well, he would soon be a
real candidate--he gets votes

00:17:47.327 --> 00:17:49.829
from the Left while he's getting
money,

00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:54.224
lots of it, from the far Right,
and among all from monarchists

00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:58.619
who somehow see him as a way of
bringing back the monarchy.

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:01.178
There's this very wealthy
monarchist duchess

00:18:01.178 --> 00:18:04.450
from--originally the family is
from Uzes in the Gard,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:10.785
in the south of France,
and she gives him lots of big

00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:13.900
bucks.
And Clemenceau dumps him as a

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.255
friend, saying that "General
Boulanger's popularity has come

00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:22.019
too soon, for one who likes
noise so very much."

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:26.223
And then this incident I keep
referring to,

00:18:26.223 --> 00:18:30.426
this crisis,
this scandal of Grévy's

00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:36.558
son-in-law begins to come along,
and there are demonstrations

00:18:36.558 --> 00:18:40.079
against the Republic's very
existence.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:42.831
The Republic,
again, it cannot take back

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:46.430
Alsace Lorraine and seems as
rampant by this sort of

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.087
pourri,
this sort of corruption,

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.369
corrupt politics here and
there.

00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:57.515
And who comes along to be
President of France but Sardi

00:18:57.515 --> 00:19:01.660
Carnot, the same one who is
going to be assassinated in

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.774
1894, as you've already heard.
And when he's elected-- there

00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:08.939
was a famous line went around,
somebody said--the president is

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:11.188
elected by the deputies,
not by the French

00:19:11.188 --> 00:19:14.230
population--and someone says to
Clemenceau, "who shall we vote

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.050
for,
Georges?

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.796
Who should we vote for?"
And he says,

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:20.029
"vote for the stupidest,
vote for Sardi Carnot."

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:24.838
And, arguably,
Sardi Carnot was the stupidest

00:19:24.838 --> 00:19:29.210
and so he becomes President of
France.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.980
I'll let any further comments
go.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:39.070
Anyway, the contrast between
Boulanger and between--and this

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:45.799
sort of impotent republic become
more and more marked.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:49.683
Now, one thing leads to
another, and Chip Sowerwine

00:19:49.683 --> 00:19:53.178
tells the story,
but it comes down to the fact

00:19:53.178 --> 00:19:56.130
that he's sitting in a
restaurant,

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:03.101
in Paris, in 1889.
He's now no longer ineligible

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:06.415
to be a candidate,
and he's elected to the Chamber

00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:09.413
of Deputies,
and he's dining in a restaurant

00:20:09.413 --> 00:20:11.589
near the Church of the
Madeleine.

00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:15.547
One could imagine it being
Maxime's, a favorite--a famous

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:19.205
restaurant there.
And there was crowds of people

00:20:19.205 --> 00:20:22.186
in the streets;
and this particular restaurant

00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:25.736
is not far from the Chamber of
Deputies, it's right across the

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:28.529
river basically from the Chamber
of Deputies.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:34.316
And he hears the crowd shouting
for him to take action,

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:37.960
to go out and greet his
adorers.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.179
And then, who knows,
as the rightists would try to

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:46.227
do on February 6th,
1934, to go across the river

00:20:46.227 --> 00:20:49.500
and to end this impotent
republic.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.366
But he just sits there,
and he sits there--en

00:20:52.366 --> 00:20:55.355
France, on mange quand
même--and he sits

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:58.099
there and he finishes his
elaborate meal.

00:20:58.099 --> 00:21:00.073
I would've been there,
not with him,

00:21:00.073 --> 00:21:03.570
I wouldn't have dined with him,
but I would have finished every

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.769
plate myself,
and every glass of wine as

00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:09.830
well.
And then he goes upstairs with

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.385
his mistress,
to a nearby hotel,

00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:18.473
and the opportunity is past.
And while he hesitates,

00:21:18.473 --> 00:21:21.339
as someone once wrote,
his enemies do not.

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:27.271
They eliminate the electoral
procedure that allowed him to be

00:21:27.271 --> 00:21:30.296
elected.
He is worried that they're

00:21:30.296 --> 00:21:34.213
going to arrest him and so he
goes off to Brussels,

00:21:34.213 --> 00:21:37.928
he goes off to Belgium.
And this makes him seem a

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:42.225
little less dashing and a little
less brave as he scurries across

00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:46.275
the frontier.
And there's a committee working

00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:49.826
for him in France,
but he stays there,

00:21:49.826 --> 00:21:55.296
and in the end what he does
is--he was very devoted to his

00:21:55.296 --> 00:21:58.332
mistress,
for all these years,

00:21:58.332 --> 00:22:03.070
and she becomes ill in 1891,
and she dies after a long,

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.733
horrible illness.
And Boulanger,

00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:08.217
notre brave
géneral,

00:22:08.217 --> 00:22:12.228
on the^( )30th of September,
1891, he went alone to her

00:22:12.228 --> 00:22:15.650
grave and blew his brains out,
and that was the end of

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.277
Boulanger.
The Republic emerged

00:22:18.277 --> 00:22:22.442
strengthened by this crisis.
But that's only one thing

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:26.531
that's important about it.
What's more important about it

00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.596
is what was happening to the
Right, in this context,

00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:35.220
and what does this have to tell
us about mass politics?

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.956
What it has to tell us is that
it's the mass politics--that

00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:44.937
Boulanger and this crisis is one
of the great examples of this

00:22:44.937 --> 00:22:48.529
new political world that you
could find.

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:53.246
I had one of my TAs years ago,
whose dissertation I directed,

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:56.424
il y a longtemps,
ça passe vite les

00:22:56.424 --> 00:22:57.769
temps, a long,
long time ago,

00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:00.972
he went off for his thesis,
which became a very interesting

00:23:00.972 --> 00:23:03.980
book, and was interested in this
very question;

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:10.159
and, so, I draw on some of his
findings that I discussed with

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:12.622
him very often.
What he did,

00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:16.067
incidentally this is what one
does with some dissertations,

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:19.809
he went off and he looked at
four different parts of France.

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.971
And one was the Marne,
that is the department of

00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:24.072
Reims;
one was the Isère,

00:23:24.072 --> 00:23:27.253
which is Grenoble's department;
one is the Gers,

00:23:27.253 --> 00:23:30.445
famous for its foie
gras, and its Armagnac too,

00:23:30.445 --> 00:23:33.421
at least in part;
and the other was the Orne,

00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:37.422
which is a Norman department in
the west, the capital of which

00:23:37.422 --> 00:23:41.384
is Alençon.
And what he was more interested

00:23:41.384 --> 00:23:45.802
in is how the message got out to
very ordinary people,

00:23:45.802 --> 00:23:49.736
living in those places.
How do they know about

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:52.570
Boulanger?
And what--and this is part of

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.448
mass politics.
One of the ways that people for

00:23:55.448 --> 00:23:57.919
centuries had learned how to
read, or not,

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:00.329
if they didn't even know how to
read,

00:24:00.329 --> 00:24:05.685
but how to imagine religious
and political and military

00:24:05.685 --> 00:24:11.338
events was in reading the
equivalent--I'm not dissing them

00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:16.366
like calling them comic strips,
but their format was rather

00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:18.404
like that;
they were called the images

00:24:18.404 --> 00:24:20.699
d'Epinal;
they were images that were

00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:24.355
cranked out that were produced
in the town of Epinal in the

00:24:24.355 --> 00:24:27.430
east of France,
in the Vosges that would

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.039
describe or show you pictures of
saints, it would show you

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:35.730
pictures of generals,
it would show you Napoleon,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.259
it would show you all sorts of
things.

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:41.502
And these are pedaled to
villages by these

00:24:41.502 --> 00:24:45.220
colporteurs,
they're called in French,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.412
by these peddlers who carry
these huge leather sacks that

00:24:48.412 --> 00:24:51.832
look like medicine balls but
they're about three times bigger

00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:54.328
than that.
And a lot of them were from the

00:24:54.328 --> 00:24:56.630
Haute-Garonne,
from the area of Toulouse;

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.992
a lot of them were from the
Cantal, that is in the mountains

00:24:59.992 --> 00:25:02.613
of the Massif Central,
and a lot of them,

00:25:02.613 --> 00:25:05.816
above all, were from the
mountains of the Alps,

00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:08.277
near Grenoble.
And these people had their

00:25:08.277 --> 00:25:10.734
whole credit networks
established, where they could

00:25:10.734 --> 00:25:13.880
get credit to get to their next
stops, always through France.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.937
It's a tremendously interesting
phenomenon, and they followed

00:25:16.937 --> 00:25:20.910
the same routes year after year.
They were known, anticipated.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.615
They sold pins,
they sold pens,

00:25:23.615 --> 00:25:28.576
they sold images of the Virgin
Mary, they sold images of

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:31.847
Saint-Sebastian,
though you wouldn't get away

00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:33.839
with selling that in parts of
France.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.995
They sold cups,
anything that they could carry

00:25:35.995 --> 00:25:39.950
and they could sell.
And they sold these images

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.893
of--they became political life.
And, so, Boulanger is plugged

00:25:45.893 --> 00:25:49.657
into this sort of popular
library, if you will,

00:25:49.657 --> 00:25:53.339
at a time when most people
could now read.

00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:58.133
The kinds of pamphlets and
images of him arrive with these

00:25:58.133 --> 00:26:03.263
peddlers, carrying this stuff on
their backs--these were hardy

00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:06.880
people--and now arriving also by
train.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.811
And so this stuff is arriving
in Charon, en Champagne,

00:26:10.811 --> 00:26:14.349
or wherever--this stuff gets
dumped off at the dock,

00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:18.611
and it goes to its next stop on
horse-drawn wagons,

00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:21.509
or on the backs of these
people.

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:25.591
And, so, what Burns found was
that in all of these

00:26:25.591 --> 00:26:30.671
départements that
these images just inundate the

00:26:30.671 --> 00:26:34.420
place--and this is modern
political life,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.660
this is really the emergence of
modern political life.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.769
So, there are two things really
interesting about Boulanger in

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:44.859
the end, besides the Republic
survives.

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:49.181
The first really is that--and
I'll make this case hopefully

00:26:49.181 --> 00:26:53.354
clearer in a minute--it's the
origins maybe of the modern

00:26:53.354 --> 00:26:57.480
Right,
but it's also part of this sort

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.516
of mass politics that happens.
And these are very rural

00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:05.483
départements.
The Gers--again,

00:27:05.483 --> 00:27:09.359
I'm sorry, g-e-r-s--the Gers,
the capital of which is Auch,

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:12.537
which has a wonderful
cathedral, is eighty-three

00:27:12.537 --> 00:27:15.173
percent rural,
at the time we're talking

00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:17.805
about.
So, these peddlers are going

00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:21.158
around to farmhouses,
or people are coming to the

00:27:21.158 --> 00:27:24.859
market and they're hearing these
sort of speakers,

00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:29.539
along with sort of charlatans
and jugglers on market day.

00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:32.505
They're hearing people talk
about notre brave

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.660
géneral,
our brave General Boulanger;

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.460
and talking about how they hate
Jews.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.430
And, so, this merges with the
anti-Semitism.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.656
A remarkable thing about this
Department of the Marne--now,

00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:49.017
as I've said before,
there's Reims,

00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:53.647
and Charon, and now all those
graves, all those graves--is

00:27:53.647 --> 00:27:58.684
that the anti-Semitic propaganda
has a tremendous impact in the

00:27:58.684 --> 00:28:04.074
Department of the Marne,
which supports Boulanger and

00:28:04.074 --> 00:28:09.400
the people who follow him;
and there were no Jews in the

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.710
Department of the Marne.
So, what happens is the

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:19.359
anti-Semites and this mass
politics constructs the Other,

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:24.005
the imagined Other,
that literally does not exist

00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:29.433
in the Department of the Marne.
So, but it lodges in what the

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:32.437
French would call the
imaginaire,

00:28:32.437 --> 00:28:36.231
in the mental universe,
the mental world of ordinary

00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:38.599
people--not all of them,
to be sure.

00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:44.368
But it is this sort of
onslaught of images of Boulanger

00:28:44.368 --> 00:28:50.349
that become part of this
enormous propaganda campaign.

00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:55.799
In France they would print out
ballots;

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:59.605
and, so, political lists would
already be printed out,

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:02.925
and you pick your list.
It's still a case in municipal

00:29:02.925 --> 00:29:04.908
elections today,
at least where we live,

00:29:04.908 --> 00:29:07.877
it must be everywhere.
And how many millions of the

00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:11.584
ballots are printed?
In 1889 Boulanger posters,

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:16.732
five million posters--that's a
phenomenal amount-- seven

00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:21.226
million ballots and,
talking about mass politics,

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.964
photos.
They are no longer just

00:29:23.964 --> 00:29:28.247
dependent upon images that some
clever person with crayons and

00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:32.740
pens have sketched that become
these images of Epinal.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:37.720
There are real photos of the
guy on his horse.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.440
And you had--before you had to
imagine what Napoleon looked

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.839
like, you had to imagine what
the king looked like;

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:47.122
although Louis XVI is
identified by somebody who once

00:29:47.122 --> 00:29:49.799
saw him from a distance when he
tries to escape to Varenne.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:53.509
Somebody had actually seen him,
and somebody else knew it was

00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:57.280
him because his nose looked the
same as his face on a coin.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.024
But you didn't see people.
But here you could see

00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:04.808
Boulanger, you could imagine
what he looked like,

00:30:04.808 --> 00:30:08.039
and even if you lived in the
Pyrenees,

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:10.000
if you lived in the
Ariège or the

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.765
Bas-Pyrénés,
you could imagine what Alsace

00:30:12.765 --> 00:30:15.922
looked like.
And it feeds into this kind of

00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:19.529
frenzy of publications about
Alsace-Lorraine.

00:30:19.529 --> 00:30:23.773
The most famous is called the
Tour de France par deux

00:30:23.773 --> 00:30:28.172
enfants, in which two
brothers promise their father on

00:30:28.172 --> 00:30:31.490
his deathbed that they will see
France.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.203
And it was the biggest selling
book, outside of the Bible,

00:30:34.203 --> 00:30:37.485
in nineteenth-century France;
and they go around in this very

00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:40.398
banal, boring book,
and they see people all wearing

00:30:40.398 --> 00:30:43.227
different costumes,
and eating different things,

00:30:43.227 --> 00:30:46.266
and doing different work,
but their hearts all pound the

00:30:46.266 --> 00:30:48.524
same way,
and they're practically in

00:30:48.524 --> 00:30:51.344
tears and a state of collapse
when they imagine

00:30:51.344 --> 00:30:54.387
Alsace-Lorraine,
and these Alsatian young women

00:30:54.387 --> 00:30:57.893
dressed in Alsatian costumes,
and thinking of la belle

00:30:57.893 --> 00:31:00.096
France,
and having to put up les

00:31:00.096 --> 00:31:02.062
borschts,
with the Germans and all of

00:31:02.062 --> 00:31:05.221
this stuff.
But, so, the numbers are--they

00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:09.670
just flood the countryside,
and these songs that people

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.388
could sing in music halls;
and a lot of the music halls in

00:31:13.388 --> 00:31:16.001
Paris--there might have been a
lot of them in Montmartre--that

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:17.930
were singing anarchist songs in
the 1890s,

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.710
but a lot of the other music
halls are singing about General

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.322
Boulanger.
And songs like The

00:31:24.322 --> 00:31:27.124
Big Sweep,
that is with a broom,

00:31:27.124 --> 00:31:30.809
sweeping away the corruption of
these deputies,

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:33.828
of the Chambre des
Députés,

00:31:33.828 --> 00:31:37.300
and putting in your kind of
big, heroic guy.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.527
And what about busts?
If you think about busts,

00:31:40.527 --> 00:31:44.845
that is sculptured busts,
this is the time when the image

00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:48.017
of the Republic,
Marianne, as I've said before,

00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:51.603
is elbowing the Virgin Mary out
of the way and there's this sort

00:31:51.603 --> 00:31:55.271
of battle over space,
on classroom walls and in the

00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:59.079
streets of cities and villages
and all of that.

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:02.186
The mission crosses are being
broken off in the middle of the

00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:04.619
night by their enemies,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:07.460
And Maurice Agulhon,
who's a great historian,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.559
one of the books that he did,
one of the many,

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:15.375
many, many books that he did
was on the images of the

00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:19.141
Republic in town halls,
in the mairie where

00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:22.602
people get married and the kinds
of statues that they put up in

00:32:22.602 --> 00:32:26.159
the Third Republic,
comparable to the kind of work

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:29.809
being done on war memorials
after World War I.

00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:34.396
And, so, Boulanger fits right
into that because there's

00:32:34.396 --> 00:32:39.314
100,000 busts of Boulanger,
and you can--you don't have to

00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:44.550
buy one, they will give one to
you to put it up where you want,

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.836
on your dresser or whatever.
And, so, this is really mass

00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:52.125
politics.
And he erodes Republican

00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:57.349
support in some places;
he doesn't do well everywhere.

00:32:57.349 --> 00:32:59.597
The Republic is really stronger
than its opponents,

00:32:59.597 --> 00:33:01.259
that's obviously one of the
points.

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:06.317
In one of the departments that
I mentioned, it doesn't matter

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:11.375
which one--it was the Gers--but
he builds upon strong support

00:33:11.375 --> 00:33:15.000
for Bonapartism in that part of
France.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.226
And of course,
one thing that he does is that

00:33:19.226 --> 00:33:23.740
he is able to--it plays off
beautifully with the

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.390
anti-Semites and their
newspapers.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:33.670
Drumont--there's a newspaper
called La libre parole,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:39.518
the free word or the open word,
is sort of the classic,

00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:44.702
virulent, rightwing newspaper.
And Charles Maurras,

00:33:44.702 --> 00:33:48.234
who was a monarchist and he was
a salaud,

00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:50.940
but he was a really great
writer,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.096
Maurras was,
just a fantastic writer,

00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:57.779
he also is just vehemently
anti-Semitic,

00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:01.821
though in a less--well,
anti-Semitism is vulgar,

00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:06.380
totally, but he's more
restrained in his criticism,

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.538
et cetera, et cetera.
But this just fits right into

00:34:09.538 --> 00:34:13.679
the image of Boulanger.
And Boulanger is willing to go

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.011
along with this.
Who knows if he was

00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:19.199
anti-Semitic or not?
Probably because of the long

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.263
traditions of anti-Semitism in
the army--more about this

00:34:23.263 --> 00:34:27.382
later--one imagines that he was.
But this is what's important

00:34:27.382 --> 00:34:30.502
about him, that and the fact
that for the first time these

00:34:30.502 --> 00:34:33.019
people are in--the Right is in
the streets,

00:34:33.019 --> 00:34:35.989
and they're toughs,
they're tough guys.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:40.376
And this anticipates the 1920s
and the 1930s also,

00:34:40.376 --> 00:34:43.420
that--and Paris has changed
too.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.639
I'm going to do a whole lecture
on Paris one day.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:50.075
But Paris is no longer the
Paris of radical republican

00:34:50.075 --> 00:34:53.672
sans-culottes,
of the artisans and the petty

00:34:53.672 --> 00:34:56.440
bourgeois who supported
Maximilien Robespierre,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.100
in the French Revolution.
It's no longer the Paris of

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.042
1848.
The geographic shifts in social

00:35:03.042 --> 00:35:06.074
structure of Paris have
transformed it,

00:35:06.074 --> 00:35:09.165
and henceforth,
until 1968, the big

00:35:09.165 --> 00:35:12.651
demonstrations,
les grands manifs,

00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:17.020
demonstrations,
are those of the Right for the

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.782
canonization of Joan of Arc,
after 1920, against the

00:35:21.782 --> 00:35:25.340
Republic in 1934.
So, it's a different Paris.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.489
But this is,
as my friend William Irvine has

00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:30.289
argued, he was one of the first
to argue this I think,

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:33.819
it is a turning point in the
history of the Right,

00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:35.658
as well.
Now, to be sure,

00:35:35.658 --> 00:35:39.501
you can't always look through
those wonderful glasses of

00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:42.659
hindsight,
and if you're trying to explain

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:47.230
Auschwitz or you're trying to
explain the arrests of the Jews,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.964
the Jewish children,
and their parents,

00:35:49.964 --> 00:35:53.130
and grandparents,
in Paris in '42 and '43,

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.816
by the French,
it's a little much to go back

00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:01.360
and say, "c'est bien la faute
du Boulanger,"

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.184
but that's the kind of
connection--it's Boulanger's

00:36:04.184 --> 00:36:07.348
fault, that's the kind of
connection that hindsight gives

00:36:07.348 --> 00:36:09.139
you,
that you have to be a little

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:11.630
careful with.
But this stuff was out there.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.400
It was out there much more in
Germany than it was in France.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.626
But Anti-Semitism was part of
all of this, and it was part of

00:36:21.626 --> 00:36:27.758
the whole image of this man,
of this poor man who had had

00:36:27.758 --> 00:36:34.119
enough and blows his brains all
over his mistress's grave.

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:40.485
Now, that's a long way of
getting to the Dreyfus Affair,

00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:47.083
and I'll say less about that
because the Dreyfus Affair is

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:52.059
more obvious than the Boulanger
Affair.

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:57.369
The Dreyfus Affair reflects
this anti-Semitism that had been

00:36:57.369 --> 00:37:02.050
accentuated by the economic
crisis that begins in the

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.472
mid-1870s,
in 1873 and 1874,

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:08.369
where it was easy to blame it
on the Jews, blame it on the

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:10.899
Jewish bankers,
blame it on the Jewish

00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:13.320
department stores,
blame it on somebody.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.764
And, but it fits rather nicely
into all that,

00:37:18.764 --> 00:37:25.570
from the point of view of
trying to analyze all that.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.829
Now, Drumont--Edward was his
name, I never did say his first

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:31.489
name--Edward,
Edward,

00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:34.965
Drumont, his newspaper
La libre parole

00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:38.313
had been very--at the
forefront of denouncing the

00:37:38.313 --> 00:37:41.753
scandals of the Republic,
arguing that the scandals were

00:37:41.753 --> 00:37:44.428
inherent in a Republic by its
very form of--its very

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:47.031
existence,
and by the fact that it's the

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.681
Jews who dominate le mur
d'argent,

00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:53.258
that is the wall of money
controlled by the Rothschilds

00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:58.030
and all of this,
the usual kind of claims.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.301
He had published a book in
which he claimed that Jewish

00:38:01.301 --> 00:38:04.028
financiers were conspiring to
dominate France,

00:38:04.028 --> 00:38:06.269
and that they indeed had done
so.

00:38:06.269 --> 00:38:15.429
And he is at the forefront of
this, of l'affaire.

00:38:15.429 --> 00:38:21.559
And what the affair does is it
pits basically against--it pits

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:25.622
Right against Left,
it pits the French Army,

00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:29.203
and the Catholic Church,
and the monarchists,

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:34.031
who are against Dreyfus,
it pits them against the

00:38:34.031 --> 00:38:40.830
Republicans, against socialists
who supported Alfred Dreyfus.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.827
Now, he's worth a minute.
In fact there's a very good

00:38:46.827 --> 00:38:49.250
book called--written again by my
former student Michael Burns,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.979
called Dreyfus,
a Family Affair,

00:38:50.979 --> 00:38:52.755
about the Dreyfus family,
not just about

00:38:52.755 --> 00:38:55.760
Dreyfus--there've been probably
forty books written about him;

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.566
but it's about his whole family.
And that's interesting in

00:38:58.566 --> 00:39:01.655
itself.
He was the son of an old Jewish

00:39:01.655 --> 00:39:05.416
family from Alsace.
His family had been peddlers,

00:39:05.416 --> 00:39:09.267
and there were many Jewish
peddlers in Eastern Europe,

00:39:09.267 --> 00:39:13.190
particularly in Poland but in
other places as well.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.814
His family became textile
manufacturers in the town of

00:39:17.814 --> 00:39:21.130
Mulhouse and then end up in a
place,

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.950
a beautiful place,
called Ribeauvillé

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.983
where
the--oh-la-la--it's

00:39:25.983 --> 00:39:29.329
magnificent where the vineyards
go right down to the

00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:32.344
bord.
But they're assimilated and

00:39:32.344 --> 00:39:34.789
proudly consider themselves
French.

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:37.454
Following 1871,
for obvious reasons,

00:39:37.454 --> 00:39:41.641
they move, and they move to
Paris, they move to the 16th

00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:44.686
arrondissement,
that is the fancy part of

00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:47.630
Paris.
Now, again, in the history of

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.710
Jewish movement,
physical movement in France,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.159
and from other places to
France,

00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:57.951
you have a growing gap between
assimilated Jews with origins in

00:39:57.951 --> 00:40:01.583
Germany or Alsace and other
places who were more

00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:04.460
assimilated,
who come, who have more money,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.264
they're more
friqué,

00:40:06.264 --> 00:40:09.434
they have more money--they're
not all wealthy--but they see

00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:12.605
themselves as very assimilated
and they live in the fancier

00:40:12.605 --> 00:40:15.516
quarters;
and the huge number of Jewish

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:19.448
immigrants who arrive with
virtually nothing from the old

00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:22.493
Pale,
from where they were allowed to

00:40:22.493 --> 00:40:26.260
settle in the Russian Empire,
and from Poland;

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.645
Poland had lost its
independence in 1795 and

00:40:28.645 --> 00:40:31.530
wouldn't get it again
until--with the Third Partition

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.750
it wouldn't get it again until
1918.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.800
And they come to Paris carrying
virtually nothing.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.835
There's one story about these
Jews who carried an empty

00:40:38.835 --> 00:40:40.834
suitcase and they said,
"why are you carrying an empty

00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:42.380
suitcase when you're leaving
Russia?"

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.164
And they said,
"because it's too shameful to

00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:46.574
have nothing to carry.
We want people to think that we

00:40:46.574 --> 00:40:49.610
have something."
And they had nothing.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.381
And they get to Paris and some
of the assimilated Jews said,

00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:54.824
"hey, we don't want those
people here because they're

00:40:54.824 --> 00:40:57.361
going to fit into this
anti-Semitic propaganda of these

00:40:57.361 --> 00:40:59.886
characters,
the dirty Jew coming from

00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:04.099
Poland, coming from Congress
Poland, and coming from Russia.

00:41:04.099 --> 00:41:08.093
And they settle in the Marais
in Paris, and they work in the

00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:10.698
garment industry,
and some of them are anarchists

00:41:10.698 --> 00:41:13.123
and some of them are Marxists,
and they were all extremely

00:41:13.123 --> 00:41:16.077
interesting people.
But Dreyfus and his family were

00:41:16.077 --> 00:41:19.071
extremely assimilated,
they were of some means,

00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:22.130
and so they live in the fancy
neighborhoods.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:26.313
And now, in 1894--I'll just
tell this story very briefly,

00:41:26.313 --> 00:41:29.825
for those of you who haven't
had time to read it

00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:34.308
yet--evidence surfaced from a
wastepaper basket in the office

00:41:34.308 --> 00:41:36.848
of a German military
attaché

00:41:36.848 --> 00:41:40.584
that somebody in the French
Army was passing secret

00:41:40.584 --> 00:41:45.141
information to the Germans about
French military operations on

00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:50.223
the edge--on the new frontier,
that is the Vosges,

00:41:50.223 --> 00:41:54.670
and Alsace and Lorraine.
And circumstantial evidence

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.840
pointed to a captain,
Dreyfus.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.490
And they confront him with the
evidence.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.732
It looks like his handwriting.
And when they do this--this is

00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:07.550
a very military gesture--they
gave him, present him with a

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.577
pistol, saying,
"you too can blow out your

00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:11.664
brains."
And, in doing so,

00:42:11.664 --> 00:42:14.507
it meant your guilt.
And he was shocked,

00:42:14.507 --> 00:42:16.233
he said, "moi,
je ne suis pas

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.738
coupable"--"I didn't do
this, it's not me,

00:42:18.738 --> 00:42:22.709
it's not me."
But that didn't matter to the

00:42:22.709 --> 00:42:25.680
army at all.
They convene him with-- and the

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.379
writing did look like his
writing too, but then more

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:31.289
things would come along to
devastate the whole case.

00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:36.020
They convoke a secret court
martial and find him guilty of

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.470
treason.
He was stripped of his rank in

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.549
a ceremony at the École
Militaire, the big military

00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:43.725
school,
and he's sent to Devil's

00:42:43.725 --> 00:42:47.610
Island, about which you have
heard, off the coast of South

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.530
America,
the northern coast, a hellhole.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:55.810
Yet more documents continued to
be leaked and the new Chief of

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.965
Army Intelligence,
a guy called Piccard--the name

00:42:59.965 --> 00:43:03.173
doesn't matter;
well, it does matter but you

00:43:03.173 --> 00:43:06.188
don't have to know it for
this--comes to the conclusion

00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:09.086
that it wasn't Dreyfus,
it couldn't have been him,

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.090
the writing is not really the
same.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.949
Now, Piccard was an unlikely
hero in all this scenario

00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:19.025
because he was an anti-Semite,
he was a vicious anti-Semite

00:43:19.025 --> 00:43:22.889
like almost everybody in the
Officer Corps at this same time.

00:43:22.889 --> 00:43:27.572
And he comes to the conclusion
that they were penned by another

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:31.399
Frenchman, Esterhazy,
a Hungarian immigrant

00:43:31.399 --> 00:43:37.469
to--second or third generation,
to France, Walsin Esterhazy.

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:40.990
But high-ranking officers get
together and they say,

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.993
"it's better to have this Jew
languishing in misery than to

00:43:44.993 --> 00:43:49.167
admit that we made a mistake."
And then along comes the right

00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:52.701
wing of the Catholic Church,
particularly the Assumptionist

00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:55.444
Order,
which says the same thing:

00:43:55.444 --> 00:43:58.230
"he's a Jew,
thus he is guilty."

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:03.690
And, so, he is just--there he
is, and nothing happens.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.137
They send Piccard off to a post
in Tunisia as punishment for

00:44:07.137 --> 00:44:11.618
having discovered the truth,
and a court puts Esterhazy on

00:44:11.618 --> 00:44:16.039
trial in a military court and he
is acquitted.

00:44:16.039 --> 00:44:18.591
Now, at this point Zola takes
up the case, he writes the

00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:21.375
famous article in a newspaper
with a headline, gros

00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:24.415
titres, J'accuse.
He says, "I accuse the Army,

00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:27.026
I accuse the government of
covering all this up,

00:44:27.026 --> 00:44:30.232
the man is innocent."
And, so, the political Right

00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:34.380
and the church hierarchy jump
against Dreyfus and socialists,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.456
and generally socialists and
radical republicans support

00:44:39.456 --> 00:44:41.402
Dreyfus.
The newspaper of the

00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:44.623
Assumptionist Order demands that
all Jews lose their citizenship

00:44:44.623 --> 00:44:47.506
and Charles Maurras,
who I mentioned before,

00:44:47.506 --> 00:44:51.366
an anti-Semitic novelist,
jumps into the fray against

00:44:51.366 --> 00:44:54.402
them.
And soon some more documents

00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:59.809
were discovered and it turns out
that these--they were added to

00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:03.562
Dreyfus's file,
long after he was languishing

00:45:03.562 --> 00:45:06.271
on the island,
and they were suddenly

00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:08.980
discovered by a man called
Henry,

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.502
an officer.
And he'd forged them to make it

00:45:12.502 --> 00:45:15.486
even clearer for those people
who wanted to believe that

00:45:15.486 --> 00:45:19.304
Dreyfus was guilty,
that Dreyfus had done other bad

00:45:19.304 --> 00:45:23.184
things too.
And, so, they--and Maurras at

00:45:23.184 --> 00:45:28.615
one point salutes Henry for his
"patriotic forgery," his

00:45:28.615 --> 00:45:32.232
patriotic forgery.
If that doesn't sound like some

00:45:32.232 --> 00:45:34.820
things in this country too,
I don't know what does.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.019
But, anyway,
finally Henry slits his throat

00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:44.420
in the military prison,
where he had been condemned for

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.775
this forgery,
and they bring Dreyfus back

00:45:48.775 --> 00:45:51.626
from his island,
a broken man,

00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:56.739
and they find him guilty
again--a military court,

00:45:56.739 --> 00:45:58.805
you're not talking about a
civil court it's a military

00:45:58.805 --> 00:46:00.170
court--and they say he is
guilty,

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.360
but with "extenuating
circumstances."

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:08.807
So, finally--and they send him
back to Devil's Island--finally

00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:14.406
he is pardoned in 1906;
no, he's pardoned actually

00:46:14.406 --> 00:46:20.206
before that, about 1900 he's
pardoned, or even 1899,

00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:25.210
but he's not fully exonerated
until 1906.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.075
But, still, this was another
moment for the right,

00:46:28.075 --> 00:46:31.000
as well, particularly the
anti-republican right,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.085
because they had concluded that
Dreyfus was guilty by the very

00:46:34.085 --> 00:46:38.023
fact that he was a Jew,
and it was better to have him

00:46:38.023 --> 00:46:43.184
in prison than to suffer the
blow of the army having been

00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:48.736
caught up in its own snare.
And he retreated to his

00:46:48.736 --> 00:46:53.460
own--sa petite vie,
comme on dit,

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.669
his own life,
amazingly enough forgiving for

00:46:58.669 --> 00:47:03.372
all what had happened.
And again, I said this earlier

00:47:03.372 --> 00:47:06.380
but I'll simply end with this,
one of the ironies of all this,

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.344
and it helps us make the point
of what happens to the Right,

00:47:10.344 --> 00:47:13.570
and the anti-Semitism in France
and in Europe,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:19.230
is that his granddaughter dies
in the death camp of Auschwitz.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.000
Have a good week;
see you on Monday.

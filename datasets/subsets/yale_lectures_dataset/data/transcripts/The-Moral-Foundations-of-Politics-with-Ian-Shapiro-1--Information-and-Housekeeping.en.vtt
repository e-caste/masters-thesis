00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.487
Prof: This course
presumes no prior knowledge of

00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:06.840
its subject matter.
 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.240
That is to say you can take
this course without having done

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.820
any political philosophy before.
 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.032
The materials we're going to
look at in this course can be

00:00:17.032 --> 00:00:20.020
approached at a number of levels
of sophistication.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.127
Indeed you could teach an
entire course on just John

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.741
Stuart Mill,
or John Rawls,

00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.440
or Karl Marx,
or Jeremy Bentham,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.964
and this means that some of you
who may have had some prior

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:39.645
acquaintance with some of these
texts will be able to explore

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:43.000
them in a different way from
newcomers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.041
But the course is designed,
as I said, to be user-friendly

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.710
to people who are doing this for
the first time.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.481
There are a few parts of the
course in which I make use of

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:59.520
technical notations or diagrams.
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.335
Now, it is true,
it's just as fact about human

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:10.257
beings that if you put a graph,
or a chart, or a curve up on a

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:14.968
diagram there are certain
people,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:19.143
some subset of the population
that get a knot in their

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:21.783
stomach,
they start to feel nauseous,

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:24.000
and their brain stops
functioning.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.319
I can totally relate to it
because I'm actually one of

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.200
those people by disposition.
 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.533
And what I can tell you about
our use of charts,

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:37.590
and diagrams,
and notations in this course is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.030
they're simply shorthand for
people who find it useful.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.295
But I will do nothing with
diagrams and charts that I don't

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.019
also do verbally.
 

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.432
So if you don't get it the one
way you'll be able to get it the

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:52.900
other way.
 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.690
 
 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.299
So you should never feel
intimidated.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.668
As I said, for people who find
graphs and charts useful they're

00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:11.371
a form of shorthand,
but obviously if they

00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:16.014
intimidate somebody and they
make what's being said opaque

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:19.030
then they're being
self-defeating.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.482
And as I said,
I will always walk verbally

00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:27.449
through anything that I also do
with charts and diagrams.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.485
Secondly, related to that
point, it's my commitment to you

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:35.592
that this is a course that's
done from first principles and

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:38.919
everything is explained from the
ground up.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:45.823
I might forget that contract
sometime and use a term that you

00:02:45.823 --> 00:02:48.008
don't understand.
 

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.510
I might use a word like
"deontological,"

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.910
and you'll sit there and you'll
be thinking,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.128
"What does that mean?"
 

00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:59.265
And the high probability is
that if you don't know what it

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:02.568
means there are probably seventy
other people in the room who

00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:04.550
don't know what it means either.
 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.986
And so if you put up your hand
and ask what it means you'll be

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:15.246
doing those sixty-nine people a
favor because they wanted to

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:18.008
know what it means as well.
 

00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.403
So we shouldn't have any
situation in this course in

00:03:21.403 --> 00:03:24.998
which I'm using some term and
you can't follow what I'm

00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:29.060
talking about because you don't
understand what it means.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.138
It is a rather embarrassing
fact about political

00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:36.133
philosophers that they don't say
in words of one syllable what

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.949
can be said in words of five
syllables.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.279
But part of my job here is to
reduce them to words of one

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.128
syllable.
 

00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:50.375
That is, to take complex
theoretical ideas and make them

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:54.008
lucid and intelligible to you.
 

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.604
And I see that as a big part of
what we're doing here so that

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:02.895
your takeaway from this course
three months from now will

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:07.644
include feeling very comfortable
with the language of political

00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:11.550
philosophy and the central
terminology in which it's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.930
conducted.
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.129
So hold my feet to the fire on
that if you need to.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.954
If I use words you don't
understand put up your hand and

00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:24.649
stop me.
 

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:30.079
I will from time to time throw
out questions and we'll have a

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:35.420
microphone that we can pass
around so that people can answer

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.050
the questions.
 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.218
It's one of the ways in which I
gauge how well the communication

00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:46.240
between us is going,
so you should expect that.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:59.970
 
 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:08.976
So this is a course about the
moral foundations of politics,

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:16.000
the moral foundations of
political argument.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.978
And the way in which we
organize it is to explore a

00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:23.800
number of traditions of
political theorizing,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.894
and these are broadly grouped
into a bigger distinction that I

00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:35.990
make between Enlightenment and
anti-Enlightenment thinking.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.809
That is to say we're going to
start of by looking at the

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:40.920
Enlightenment.
 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.416
Now you might say,
"Well, what is the

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:43.000
Enlightenment?
 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.569
How do you know it when you
trip over it?"

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.372
and that is a subject I'm going
to get to on Wednesday and

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:52.290
Friday.
 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.053
But for right now I'll say just
dogmatically,

00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:05.259
and I'll elaborate for you
later, that the Enlightenment

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.189
revolved around two ideas.
 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.098
The first is the idea of basing
our theories of politics on

00:06:17.098 --> 00:06:20.144
science--
not on religion,

00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:24.009
not on tradition,
not on superstition,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.009
not on natural law,
but on science.

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.112
The Enlightenment was born of
an enormous optimism about the

00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:34.990
possibilities of science.
 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.726
And in this course we will look
at Enlightenment theories that

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:47.029
put science at the core of
political argument.

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:51.362
The second main Enlightenment
idea is the idea that individual

00:06:51.362 --> 00:06:54.699
freedom is the most important
political good.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.185
And so if you wanted to get the
bumper sticker version of the

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:03.569
Enlightenment account of
politics,

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.093
it is, "How do you
scientifically design a society

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.360
to maximize individual
freedom?"

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.036
Now, within that,
we will look at three

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:21.069
Enlightenment traditions.
 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.884
We'll look at the utilitarian
tradition, the Marxist

00:07:23.884 --> 00:07:26.480
tradition, and the social
contract tradition.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.680
And again, I'll just give you
the one-line version now and

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.997
then we're going to come back to
all of these,

00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:37.240
of course, in much greater
detail later.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.119
The utilitarian tradition says
that the way in which you create

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:46.290
a scientifically organized
society is you maximize the

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.910
greatest happiness of the
greatest number.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.850
This is the slogan of
utilitarianism.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.009
Maximize the greatest happiness
of the greatest number.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:02.964
You'll find there're huge
disagreements among utilitarians

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:05.040
about how you measure your
happiness,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.153
and how you maximize it,
and how you know when you've

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:11.752
maximized it and so on,
but the utilitarians all agree

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:16.168
that that's the goal,
and if you can do that you will

00:08:16.168 --> 00:08:21.129
do more to maximize human
freedom than anything else.

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:26.855
The Marxist tradition has a
very different theory of

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:31.925
science,
what Marx called the science of

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:37.322
historical materialism,
but it too was based on this

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:42.504
idea that we can have impersonal
scientific principles that give

00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:47.029
us the right answer for the
organization of society.

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:51.264
One of Marx's famous one-liners
was that we will eventually get

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:55.500
to a world in which politics is
replaced by administration,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.202
implying that all forms of
moral disagreement will have

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:05.254
gone away because we will have
gotten technically the right

00:09:05.254 --> 00:09:06.298
answers.
 

00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:10.475
Another formulation of that
same idea actually comes from a

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:14.865
different Enlightenment thinker
who we're not going to read in

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:17.985
this course,
David Hume, who said,

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:22.408
"If all moral
disagreements were resolved,

00:09:22.408 --> 00:09:28.500
no political disagreements
would remain."

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.736
So that's the idea of a
scientific solution to what

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:40.850
appear to be the moral dilemmas
that divide us.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.398
So for Marx we'll see a very
different theory of science,

00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:47.249
but for him too,
he thinks that freedom is the

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:48.769
most important good.
 

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:50.389
That might surprise you.
 

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.452
Most people think,
"Well, Marx was about

00:09:52.452 --> 00:09:52.970
equality.
 

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.620
He was egalitarian."
 

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.740
We'll see that that's only true
in a somewhat derivative sense

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.274
because in the end what was
important for Marx was that

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:09.500
people are equally free,
that they are in a situation of

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.924
not being exploited,
and he too, therefore,

00:10:13.924 --> 00:10:17.149
is an Enlightenment thinker.
 

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.390
Then the social contract
tradition says that the way we

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.788
get a scientific theory of
society is to think about what

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:30.580
agreement people would make if
they were designing society for

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.230
the first time.
 

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.721
If society was going to be
based on a contract,

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.129
what would it look like?
 

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:41.879
And this is what gives us the
right answer as to what is--

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:48.740
rational scientific principles
tell us how we should organize

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.214
society,
and it's a world in which

00:10:51.214 --> 00:10:54.178
people's freedom is preserved
because it's what they choose to

00:10:54.178 --> 00:10:54.470
do.
 

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.431
Again, as in these other
Enlightenment traditions there's

00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:02.178
massive disagreement about who
makes the contract,

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:07.323
how they make it,
what the content of it would

00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:09.964
be,
but it's the metaphor of a

00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:14.697
social contract that shapes all
reasoning about the way in which

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:18.456
you can organize society
scientifically in order to

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:20.110
preserve freedom.
 

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.746
So in the first two-thirds of
the course we're going to work

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:29.070
our way through those three
Enlightenment traditions.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.815
But every current has it
undertow, and even though the

00:11:33.815 --> 00:11:37.933
Enlightenment was this
enormously energetic and

00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:43.126
captivating tradition that
really starts in the seventeenth

00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:48.408
century and gathers steam in the
eighteenth century,

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:53.090
there was always resistance to
the Enlightenment,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.931
both it's preoccupation with
science and its view that

00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:00.408
individual freedom is the most
important good.

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:04.600
And so after we're done looking
at the Enlightenment,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.320
we're going to look at
anti-Enlightenment thinking,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.815
and the tradition that resists
the idea that there are

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:17.158
scientific principles around
which society can be organized,

00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:21.533
and resist the idea that the
freedom of the individual is the

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:24.916
most important good,
and we'll explore that

00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:25.769
tradition.
 

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:30.149
And then in the last part of
the course we will turn to the

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.870
democratic tradition which
tries,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:38.000
at least in the way I will
present this to you,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.735
to reconcile the
anti-Enlightenment critique of

00:12:40.735 --> 00:12:44.125
the Enlightenment with those
elements of the Enlightenment

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:47.100
that survive the
anti-Enlightenment critique,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.000
if you see what I'm saying.
 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.673
So democracy becomes the
resolution, at least in the way

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:58.158
I'll describe democracy in this
course.

00:12:58.158 --> 00:13:04.594
Thereby hangs another tale that
I want to tell you about this

00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:05.558
course.
 

00:13:05.558 --> 00:13:11.051
The course is introductory and
presented in a user-friendly way

00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:14.860
to newcomers,
but it also is an argument.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.399
That is, I'm presenting an
argument,

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.970
a point of view,
which some of you will be,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.889
"I'm persuaded by,"
and that is totally fine.

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:29.777
The idea is not to make you
think what I think or what your

00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:32.620
teaching assistant thinks.
 

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.178
It's rather to make you
understand the logic underlying

00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:39.210
your own views better than you
have before,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.291
and perhaps see the appeal of
views you have hitherto rejected

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:47.288
more clearly than you have
before.

00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:50.865
So the idea is to enhance the
sophistication of your own

00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:54.490
understanding of politics,
not to have you parrot my

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.000
views, or teaching fellows'
views,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.720
or anybody else's views.
 

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.916
It's rather to understand the
nature of your own views and how

00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:10.402
they might connect or live in
tension with the views of

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:11.519
others.
 

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:16.203
One thing you're going to find,
I should also say just as a

00:14:16.203 --> 00:14:21.206
matter of truth in advertising,
we're going to look at a number

00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:24.482
of what I would call
architectonic theories of

00:14:24.482 --> 00:14:27.460
politics,
the theories that try to give

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.720
the whole answer.
 

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.509
This is Jeremy Bentham.
 

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:33.279
This is his scientific theory.
 

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.820
These are all the pieces.
 

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.075
This is how they fit together
and this is what it means for

00:14:38.075 --> 00:14:40.320
the organization of schools,
and prisons,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.788
and parliaments,
and all the rest of it.

00:14:42.788 --> 00:14:46.129
He's got an architectonic
theory of the whole thing.

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:49.331
John Rawls, as well,
you'll see an architectonic

00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:51.240
theory of the whole thing.
 

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.432
One of the takeaway points of
this course is going to be that

00:14:56.432 --> 00:14:59.029
architectonic theories fail.
 

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:02.879
There is no silver bullet.
 

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:07.840
You're not going to find a
takeaway set of propositions

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.798
that you can plaster onto future
political dilemmas.

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:16.035
What you're going to find
instead, I think what's going to

00:15:16.035 --> 00:15:18.788
help you in this course,
what's going to be the useful

00:15:18.788 --> 00:15:23.408
takeaway,
is rather small and medium

00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:25.970
sized insights.
 

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.707
You're going to find things to
put in your conceptual bag of

00:15:30.707 --> 00:15:33.678
tricks and take and use
elsewhere,

00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:37.985
and they're going to be very
helpful to you in analyzing a

00:15:37.985 --> 00:15:40.100
whole variety of problems.
 

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.368
I think if you talk to other
students who've taken this

00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:51.320
course that tends to be the most
useful takeaway that you get,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.370
that you'll find.
 

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.070
When somebody brings up an
argument,

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.633
say, about what people are
entitled to you'll have a whole

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:05.515
series of questions you would
ask about that argument that you

00:16:05.515 --> 00:16:10.000
wouldn't have asked if you
hadn't taken this course.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.863
So you'll find a lot of small
and medium sized bits and pieces

00:16:13.863 --> 00:16:16.840
that you can take and use in
other contexts,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.201
but you're not going to find a
one-size fits all answer to the

00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:24.750
basic dilemmas of politics.
 

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.197
Let me say one other thing
about this course as being an

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:35.745
argument, that the argument's
presented from a particular

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.529
point of view.
 

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.201
You might say,
"Well,"

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:48.190
looking through this syllabus,
"Hmm, this guy is pretty

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.730
arrogant.
 

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.089
I mean, here we have John
Locke, John Stuart Mill,

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:55.557
Jeremy Bentham,
and he's got his own,

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.779
some of his own work here on
this syllabus.

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:01.379
Who does he think he is?
 

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:08.586
I mean, these are the greats of
the tradition and he's putting

00:17:08.586 --> 00:17:10.950
his own work here?
 

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.759
It takes a lot of chutzpah to
do that."

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:18.484
And let me tell you a little
vignette that I think will give

00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:22.808
you the spirit in which my work
is on this syllabus.

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:26.673
When I was an undergraduate
there was a great Kant scholar

00:17:26.673 --> 00:17:30.334
called Stephan K�rner
who was here in the Yale

00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:34.266
Philosophy Department for many
years and also taught at the

00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:36.910
University of Bristol in
England.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.960
And I attended his lectures on
Kant,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.730
and he stood up in the very
first lecture and he said,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:50.170
"Kant was a great
philosopher,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.920
und I am a minor philosopher,
but with me you have the

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.608
advantage that I am alive."
 

00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:05.298
So this is the spirit in which
my work is there,

00:18:05.298 --> 00:18:10.191
and it's not remotely intended
to be a suggestion that 200

00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:15.683
years from now or 300 years from
now people will be reading it or

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:21.519
that it stands on a par with the
classic works of the tradition.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:26.560
But one of our agendas in this
course is not just to get you up

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.440
to speed in the great text of
these different traditions,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.117
but to give you some sense of
how people who currently do this

00:18:36.117 --> 00:18:39.108
for a living argue about these
ideas.

00:18:39.108 --> 00:18:42.979
So in each one of the five
traditions that we look at,

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:46.630
we're going to begin with a
classic formulation.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:51.181
So Jeremy Bentham is the
locus classicus of

00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:53.690
classical utilitarianism.
 

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.000
He's the major formative
statement of that view.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.634
So we'll start with Bentham,
but then we will bring

00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:03.690
utilitarianism up to the present
day.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.498
We'll explore how the
utilitarian tradition evolved

00:19:07.498 --> 00:19:11.686
since the eighteenth century and
we will bring you up to

00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:15.798
contemporary considerations
about utilitarianism,

00:19:15.798 --> 00:19:18.358
what people argue about in the
journals today,

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:22.009
and the book literature,
and so on.

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:26.087
Likewise with Marxism,
we'll start with Marx and

00:19:26.087 --> 00:19:31.468
Engels themselves and then bring
you up to contemporary debates

00:19:31.468 --> 00:19:33.029
about Marxism.
 

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:36.809
Social contract tradition,
we'll start with John Locke who

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:40.391
has famously formulated the
social contract idea in the

00:19:40.391 --> 00:19:44.026
seventeenth century,
but we'll bring it up to modern

00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:47.470
contract theorists like Robert
Nozick and John Rawls.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.299
The anti-Enlightenment
tradition we go back to Edmund

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:53.146
Burke,
the great anti-Enlightenment

00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:56.067
thinker,
an opponent of the French

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:58.425
Revolution,
but we'll bring

00:19:58.425 --> 00:20:03.446
anti-Enlightenment thinking up
to contemporary thinkers like

00:20:03.446 --> 00:20:05.318
Alasdair MacIntyre.
 

00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:08.980
And finally with the democratic
tradition,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.828
we'll go back to the Federalist
Papers,

00:20:12.828 --> 00:20:18.234
which is in many ways one of
the most important statements of

00:20:18.234 --> 00:20:22.380
what's at issue with democratic
principles,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.250
if not a defense of democracy
we'll see later,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.616
and bring that up to the
contemporary literature on

00:20:29.616 --> 00:20:33.118
democracy which is where my own
thinking comes in.

00:20:33.118 --> 00:20:35.367
But as I say,
you should remember

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:39.157
Stephan K�rner's
admonition that you're getting

00:20:39.157 --> 00:20:43.141
the benefit of the fact that I
happen to be around in the first

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.838
decade of the twenty-first
century,

00:20:45.838 --> 00:20:52.095
not that I'm attempting to put
myself on that kind of a

00:20:52.095 --> 00:20:53.368
pedestal.
 

00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:58.828
Now, I want to say a few more
general things about the course

00:20:58.828 --> 00:21:04.289
just to give you a sense of the
flavor of what we do here.

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:07.632
You might say, "Well,
what is distinctive about this

00:21:07.632 --> 00:21:11.718
course as compared with other
introductory political theory

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:15.803
and political philosophy courses
that you could take around

00:21:15.803 --> 00:21:16.930
here?"
 

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.622
And I think there are four
senses in which this course is

00:21:20.622 --> 00:21:24.380
distinctive, not necessarily
better but just different.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.012
And so that you can give you
some sense of what it is that

00:21:29.012 --> 00:21:32.588
you would be letting yourself in
for here.

00:21:32.588 --> 00:21:36.736
The first is what I've just
mentioned that with each of

00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:41.343
these five traditions we really
are going to take them from a

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:45.720
classical formulation up to
contemporary discussions.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.626
So you'll have a,
at least, working sense of how

00:21:49.626 --> 00:21:54.615
these traditions have evolved
over the course of two or three

00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:59.769
hundred years and what form
debates about them today take.

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:05.363
The second is that this course
is really going to mix the

00:22:05.363 --> 00:22:08.460
theoretical with the applied.
 

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.240
We are going to look at first
principles.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.701
I use the terms foundations
advisedly in the title of the

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:16.630
course there.
 

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.420
It's something of a loaded term
in that there are some people

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:28.788
who think we should do political
philosophy without foundations.

00:22:28.788 --> 00:22:31.903
And I'll have something to say
about those arguments later in

00:22:31.903 --> 00:22:34.516
the course,
but I do want to signal with

00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:38.558
that term we will be interested
in foundational questions,

00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:42.818
the most basic questions you
can ask about politics,

00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:49.038
but we will never limit our
intention to those questions.

00:22:49.038 --> 00:22:54.243
We will work these doctrines
through a huge array of

00:22:54.243 --> 00:22:59.038
contemporary problems ranging
from abortion,

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:03.170
to affirmative action,
to the death penalty,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:10.016
to all kinds of other things
that are of concern to you as we

00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:11.500
go through.
 

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.578
So it's very much a part of
what we do in this course is to

00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:22.009
look at how these doctrines
actually play out on the ground.

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:26.167
So we go back and forth from
particular examples to general

00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:30.900
arguments and back to particular
examples a lot in this course,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.690
and in that sense it's more of
a course,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.277
I'd say, in applied political
philosophy than many courses one

00:23:40.277 --> 00:23:46.259
might take,
here or elsewhere.

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:51.652
A third distinctive feature of
the course is that I'm going to

00:23:51.652 --> 00:23:55.630
organize it centrally around one
question,

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.244
which seems to me at the end of
the day to be the most important

00:24:00.244 --> 00:24:01.930
question of politics.
 

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:06.190
And that is the question that I
put in the first sentence of the

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.338
syllabus there.
 

00:24:07.338 --> 00:24:11.638
When do governments deserve our
allegiance and when should they

00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:12.680
be denied it?
 

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:19.220
When and under what conditions
should we obey the government,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.009
when are we free to disobey the
government,

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:28.030
and when might we even have an
obligation to oppose the

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.000
government?
 

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.702
Another way,
if you want to translate this

00:24:31.702 --> 00:24:35.460
into the jargon of political
theory, what is it that makes

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.240
governments legitimate?
 

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.480
What is the basis for
legitimate government?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.510
That is going to be the core
organizing idea or question with

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.743
which we're going to interrogate
these different traditions that

00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:50.767
we examine,
utilitarian,

00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:54.722
Marxist, social contract,
anti-Enlightenment and

00:24:54.722 --> 00:24:56.630
democratic traditions.
 

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.862
We're going to look at how does
each one of those traditions

00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:05.021
answer the most basic questions
about the legitimacy of the

00:25:05.021 --> 00:25:05.740
state.
 

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.666
As I say, I think it's
ultimately the most important

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:12.890
question in politics.
 

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.480
It's not the only question in
politics.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.759
It's not the only way to
organize a course in political

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:22.221
philosophy, but it is the way in
which we'll organize this

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:22.890
course.
 

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:29.452
We'll focus our questions on
legitimacy, and it'll provide

00:25:29.452 --> 00:25:35.208
the template for comparing
across these traditions,

00:25:35.208 --> 00:25:36.358
right?
 

00:25:36.358 --> 00:25:38.920
We will be looking at how
utilitarians,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.404
or social contract theorists,
or democratic theorists look at

00:25:42.404 --> 00:25:45.599
this basic question of what it
is that makes governments

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:49.049
legitimate,
how we know that when we fall

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:53.460
over it,
and what we should do about it.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:00.009
So that's the third sense in
which the course is distinctive,

00:26:00.009 --> 00:26:04.513
and the fourth one I want to
mention is that we're going to

00:26:04.513 --> 00:26:09.405
go back and forward between two
modes of analysis which for want

00:26:09.405 --> 00:26:13.288
of better terms I call internal
and external,

00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:17.868
and let me explain what I mean
by those terms.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:24.019
When you look at an argument
that somebody puts forward,

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.630
and you look at in the way that
I'm describing as internal,

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.900
what you're basically saying is
does it make sense?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.119
Is it persuasive?
 

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:35.338
Are the premises plausible?
 

00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:37.529
Do the conclusions follow from
the premises?

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:40.420
Are there contradictions in
what the person's saying?

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.900
Does it all hang together?
 

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.259
Should I believe it?
 

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:45.068
Is it a good argument?
 

00:26:45.068 --> 00:26:48.858
That's what internal analysis
is about, okay.

00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:55.753
External analysis is looking at
the argument as a causal force

00:26:55.753 --> 00:26:57.450
in the world.
 

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:02.060
What social and political
arrangements is this argument

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.818
used to justify,
or what social and political

00:27:05.818 --> 00:27:08.980
arrangement is it used to
attack?

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.440
How does this operate as a
political ideology in the world

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.380
out there?
 

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:19.440
What effects does it have if I
embrace this argument?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.967
So it's not a question about
whether or not it's a good

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:23.700
argument or you should believe
it,

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.592
but a question about how this
argument is efficacious in the

00:27:27.592 --> 00:27:28.118
world.
 

00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:32.048
Because there could be terrible
arguments that are nonetheless

00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:34.558
very efficacious in the world,
right?

00:27:34.558 --> 00:27:38.489
And there might be very good
arguments that nobody takes

00:27:38.489 --> 00:27:40.990
seriously in day-to-day
politics.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.644
And one of the great
aspirations of the Enlightenment

00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:50.749
is to produce arguments that
both make good analytical and

00:27:50.749 --> 00:27:54.420
philosophical sense on the one
hand,

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.990
and can be influential in the
world on the other,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.250
but those things don't
necessarily go together.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:07.368
And we're going to ask a
question, why,

00:28:07.368 --> 00:28:11.509
in the context of exploring all
of these traditions,

00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:15.740
if there are good arguments
that are not efficacious,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.930
why that is?
 

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.981
If there are bad arguments that
are efficacious,

00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:22.190
why that is?
 

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.531
But in any case we're going to,
even if we can't answer that

00:28:26.531 --> 00:28:29.534
why question,
which is a very hard question

00:28:29.534 --> 00:28:32.455
to answer,
we're going to look at these

00:28:32.455 --> 00:28:37.328
arguments and these traditions
both internally and externally.

00:28:37.328 --> 00:28:40.056
You're going to look at them as
arguments and you're going to

00:28:40.056 --> 00:28:45.287
look at them as ideologies,
as systems of thought that get

00:28:45.287 --> 00:28:49.798
trafficked in the political
world.

00:28:49.798 --> 00:28:55.127
And I think that that is
another feature of this course

00:28:55.127 --> 00:29:00.555
that differentiates it from
other introductory political

00:29:00.555 --> 00:29:02.430
theory courses.
 

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:07.515
So I think that gives you
something of a flavor of what is

00:29:07.515 --> 00:29:10.460
distinctive in what we do here.
 

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.920
 
 

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.848
Any questions about any of that?
 

00:29:16.848 --> 00:29:21.188
If any of it's puzzling to you
it's probably puzzling to

00:29:21.188 --> 00:29:22.450
somebody else.
 

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:29.220
 
 

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:37.026
So in the spirit of getting us
going we're going to start with

00:29:37.026 --> 00:29:39.970
a real world problem.
 

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.788
We're going to start with the
problem of Adolf Eichmann,

00:29:44.788 --> 00:29:51.858
who was a lieutenant colonel in
Nazi Germany,

00:29:51.858 --> 00:29:58.595
who was responsible for
organizing the shipment of Jews

00:29:58.595 --> 00:30:01.338
to Nazi death camps.
 

00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:08.442
And at the end of the war,
he was captured along with a

00:30:08.442 --> 00:30:15.019
lot of other former Nazis,
and he was inadvertently

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:16.730
released.
 

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:21.590
They didn't realize that he was
a significant player in the

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:26.618
organization of the so-called
final solution of the Jews,

00:30:26.618 --> 00:30:30.700
and they released him and he
escaped.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.305
And like many other former
Nazis who escaped he went to

00:30:35.305 --> 00:30:40.251
Argentina and he lived under an
assumed name for many years

00:30:40.251 --> 00:30:45.200
until the late 1950s when the
Israeli Secret Service,

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.001
the Mossad, figured out that he
was there and figured out who he

00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:50.460
was.
 

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.200
And they sent a group of people
who,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.630
essentially commandos,
who captured him,

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:06.538
spirited him out of Argentina,
took him to Israel where they

00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:11.449
brought back the death penalty
which had not existed at that

00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:17.471
time in Israeli law,
tried him for crimes against

00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:21.480
humanity,
which was the same concept that

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.766
had been employed at the
Nuremberg Trials of his cohort

00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:29.019
after World War II in the late
1940s,

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:32.112
crimes against humanity and
crimes against the Jewish people

00:31:32.112 --> 00:31:33.368
and they executed him.
 

00:31:33.368 --> 00:31:37.480
And at that time young
political theorist,

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:44.009
not particularly well known,
called Hannah Arendt,

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:46.663
covered the trail for
The New Yorker

00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:50.142
magazine in a series of
articles which were subsequently

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:54.336
published as a book called,
Eichmann in Jerusalem,

00:31:54.336 --> 00:31:58.868
which is what I'm having you
read for Wednesday's class.

00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:05.662
And we're going to use this
Eichmann problem as a way into

00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:10.308
the central conundrum of the
course,

00:32:10.308 --> 00:32:17.009
which I said is what is it that
gives states legitimacy?

00:32:17.009 --> 00:32:20.864
When should we obey the
government, when are we free not

00:32:20.864 --> 00:32:24.998
to, and when should we perhaps
even be obliged to oppose the

00:32:24.998 --> 00:32:26.048
government?
 

00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:32.421
Because this problem was thrown
into sharp relief by the conduct

00:32:32.421 --> 00:32:35.858
of Eichmann during World War II.
 

00:32:35.858 --> 00:32:45.128
And I want you to think about
two questions while you read

00:32:45.128 --> 00:32:48.555
this,
which is essentially,

00:32:48.555 --> 00:32:54.221
this book is essentially a
compilation of Arendt's New

00:32:54.221 --> 00:32:56.549
Yorker articles.
 

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:57.880
The first is up here.
 

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.064
What I want you to do is to
think about what the two things

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:07.980
are that make you most
uncomfortable about this man,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.900
who you'll get know quite well
through reading this book.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.868
What is it about him that is
unnerving?

00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:19.108
What is it that makes your
flesh crawl about this guy?

00:33:19.108 --> 00:33:24.510
What are the two things that
are the most appalling about

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.088
him?
 

00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:30.767
And then the other question I
want you to address is the

00:33:30.767 --> 00:33:32.108
second one.
 

00:33:32.108 --> 00:33:38.484
What two things make you most
uncomfortable about the events

00:33:38.484 --> 00:33:43.132
surrounding his apprehension,
and his trail,

00:33:43.132 --> 00:33:46.588
and his execution in Israel?
 

00:33:46.588 --> 00:34:19.563
Those are your reading
questions for Eichmann in

00:34:19.563 --> 00:34:41.985
Jerusalem,
and write them down,

00:34:41.985 --> 00:35:14.960
and bring them with you to
class on Wednesday.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.000

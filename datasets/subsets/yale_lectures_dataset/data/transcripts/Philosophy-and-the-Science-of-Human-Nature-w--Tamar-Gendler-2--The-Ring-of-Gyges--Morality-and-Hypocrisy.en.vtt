00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:06.440
PROFESSOR: So today's lecture
is about the question of the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.190
challenge that Glaucon
posed in the story

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.690
of the ring of Gyges.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.055
The question is: what sort of
motivations do we have for

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:21.013
acting morally, and what
expectations should we have

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:25.490
with respect to those around us
about whether they act in

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.110
that way, for reasons intrinsic
to moral motivation,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.640
or simply because they wish to
appear a particular way?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
So what I want to start by
doing, is tell you a little

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.560
bit about the extraordinary
person whose dialogue, The

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.502
Republic, we read excerpts
from today.

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:56.605
It's hard to overestimate the
influence of Plato on the

00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:59.810
Western intellectual
tradition.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.290
There is no educated person in
the Western world in the last

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.030
2500 years who wasn't influenced
in some way or

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.130
another by the thought and by
the framework of understanding

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.372
that Plato provided for us
some 2500 years ago.

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:28.540
Plato was an extremely
interesting figure.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.980
He was born into an aristocratic
family in Athens.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.977
Some think that he was descended
from one of the

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:40.920
Athenian kings, but regardless,
it's clear that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
the family of which he was a
part were among the leaders of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.100
Athenian political society.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.601
Several of his uncles had been
part of a coup in the

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.350
government that took place
several years before Plato

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.490
came to maturity.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.870
And the expectation of people
like Plato was that they would

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.880
go into civics or government.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.120
Public leadership.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.550
It was as if he were a Kennedy
or a Bush or a Clinton.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.710
He came from a family with a
long history of political

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.970
engagement.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.700
And the assumption was that he
would become politically

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.140
engaged, himself.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.450
But interestingly, for reasons
about there are great

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.920
speculations, Plato came under
the influence of a man about

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.040
thirty years his elder named
Socrates, who, in the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.990
portraits that we have
of him, looked

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.970
remarkably like Plato himself.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.680
Socrates was a gadfly.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.540
He wandered around Athens and
asked people to reflect on

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.972
their commitments.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:05.970
Asked people to think about what
the nature of fundamental

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.040
things like justice, and
truth, and reality, and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.970
friendship, and love,
and honesty were.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.036
He asked people to reflect on
common opinion, and to ask

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:26.410
themselves what, of the things
that they believed, were

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.570
well-grounded, and what, of the
things that they believed,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.850
were simply matters of
received opinion.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.470
And in part because of his
provocation, Socrates was

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.120
sentenced to death in 399,
before the Common Era.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.440
When Plato was roughly thirty
years old, Plato attended the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.940
death of his great teacher.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.520
And he describes the story of
the trial at which Socrates

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.760
was accused of corrupting the
youth of Athens in an

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.520
extraordinary dialogue
known as The Apology.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.800
And the legacy that The Apology
provides is something

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.460
like the legacy that
the Gospel provides

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.920
for the life of Jesus.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.380
It's a story of a person willing
to die for the sake of

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.260
principle in a way that became
a trope for Western

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.070
civilization.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.660
So in an extraordinary painting,
which you can see if

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.656
you go to the Metropolitan
Museum in New York City, there

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:51.990
is a depiction of the
death of Socrates.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.710
And here is Socrates, drinking
from the chalice of hemlock,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.930
which is to put him to death.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.040
Here are his disciples,
including Plato, calmly at the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.130
end of the bed, and Crito,
holding his leg.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.720
Up the stairs here, which you
can't see, are some other

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.478
figures leaving.

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:18.890
But what's extraordinary about
this picture is that it was

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:28.730
painted in 1787 by one of the
artists involved in the French

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.100
revolution.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.983
It was, in fact, displayed to
Thomas Jefferson, who admired

00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:37.594
it greatly.

00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:41.725
And one of the striking things
about its composition, is that

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:45.890
in some ways, it echoes Leonardo
da Vinci's famous

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.830
painting of The Last Supper,
where those of you who are

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.760
familiar with the painting know,
Jesus sits at the center

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.830
of the table, surrounded
by disciples.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.661
Whereas that is a story of death
for the sake of faith,

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:11.430
Socrates's story is a story of
death for the sake of reason.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.130
And the idea that a life lived
on the basis of principle,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.730
recorded by disciples, who can
explain the motivation for

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.330
that life, the idea that that
can influence thousands of

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.410
years of history and can inspire
political change and

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.290
principled commitment, is
one of the legacies

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.276
that Plato left us.

00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:50.930
After Socrates's death, Plato
devoted himself to a life of

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.980
learning, in 385 before the
Common Era, started what many

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:04.510
call the first university, or
academy, in the Western world.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:11.340
At that academy, Plato trained
many of the thinkers of

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.320
ancient Athens, including
Aristotle, whose work we'll be

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.490
reading next week.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.260
While there, Plato composed
a number of

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.580
works that have endured.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.830
Among them is The Republic,
which we read

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.580
excerpts from for today.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.452
And here's a particularly
beautiful third century

00:07:35.452 --> 00:07:40.220
manuscript of The Republic, one
of the tens of thousands

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.100
of documents discovered at
Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, roughly

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.730
a century ago.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.663
And I've put the spelling up
there, so that those of you

00:07:50.663 --> 00:07:54.390
who are intrigued can go and
read about the story of the

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.580
Oxyrhynchus papyri, which is
one of the most incredible

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.652
detective stories of discovery
of a huge trove of documents.

00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:08.550
As I said again, only a century
ago, many of them

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.020
retrieved only during and after
the First World War.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.760
So Plato's Republic, as I
mentioned, is one of roughly

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.860
thirty dialogues that
Plato composed.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.420
You might have noticed in the
course of reading it, as the

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.647
reading guide indicated,
that it's not

00:08:24.647 --> 00:08:26.890
written as a treatise.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.820
It's written in the form
of a conversation.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.340
And except for some letters that
we have of Plato, nearly

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.370
all of the work of his
that we have comes

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.220
in the form of dialogue.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.640
And they address almost every
philosophical topic

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.060
imaginable.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.960
The nature of knowledge, the
nature of truth, the nature of

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.210
love, the nature of friendship,
and so on.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.520
The Republic, in particular, is
focused on the question of

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.350
how society ought to be
structured to allow human

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.630
beings to flourish.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.930
And the work, as we've inherited
it, is structured

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.302
into ten books, of which we
will read in this class

00:09:14.302 --> 00:09:19.390
excerpts from the second book
and most of the tenth.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.815
In the particular part that
we're reading, we overhear a

00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:27.800
conversation among
three characters.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.960
One of them is Plato's teacher
Socrates, the fellow with the

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.090
snub nose that I showed you
the slide of earlier.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.480
And the other two are Plato's
brothers, Glaucon and

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.220
Adeimantus.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.600
And the conversation that we
hear takes place first between

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.320
Socrates and Glaucon, and then
between Socrates and

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.340
Adeimantus.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.060
But we're, of course,
not reading off

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.570
the Oxyrhynchus papyrus.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.600
We're not even reading, as some
students at Yale are this

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.130
semester, the text in
the original Greek.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.340
There's a seminar being offered
in my department on

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.920
Plato's Republic, a whole
semester, during which they

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.700
are reading the text
in ancient Greek.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.230
And there's an extraordinary
Yale-London collaboration of a

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.500
decade during which one week
each year, professors from

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.570
Yale and professors from London
get together and read

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.880
one book of Plato's Republic.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.260
So this is a book that is
read seriously here.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.820
We, however, are fortunate
enough to be reading an

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.280
edition, which I've asked all
of you to purchase, which

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.870
looks like this.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.320
And I want to explain to you
why I've asked you to buy a

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.730
book given that, as many of you
might have noticed, the

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.910
translation of the Republic,
a late nineteenth century

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.270
translation by Benjamin
Jowett, is

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.300
available, on the internet.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.390
And I just want to say a few
words about what value there

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.580
is in getting editions of books
which are designed to

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.670
help students engage seriously
with the material.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.380
So in the copy of The Republic
that I've asked you to

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.380
purchase, there are extensive
introductory materials.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.270
There are extraordinarily
helpful footnotes.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.466
There's an annotated
bibliography in the

00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:22.650
preparatory material that tells
you what books to look

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.410
at if you're interested
in Plato.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.280
There's an incredibly
valuable index.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.260
And in the margins are what
I've told you are called

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.540
Stephanus numbers, which allow
you to make reference to any

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.290
other translation.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.255
So let's now move to the
substance of the material that

00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:46.080
we read for today.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.400
What is it that Glaucon, Plato's
brother, is seeking to

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.955
do in the course of his
conversation with Socrates?

00:11:57.955 --> 00:12:02.006
There are three questions that
Glaucon wants to answer.

00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:05.320
The first is that he wants to
say something about the nature

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.884
and origin of justice.

00:12:07.884 --> 00:12:13.981
How is it that people come to
behave in cooperative ways,

00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:17.660
and what is it that we speak
of when we talk about the

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.440
norms of justice?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.355
This is a topic that we'll
discuss when we get to Hobbes,

00:12:23.355 --> 00:12:26.790
and so I'm not going to say
more today about the

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.700
particular argument that
Glaucon offers there.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.840
What I want to focus on,
instead, are two things:

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.291
Glaucon's second and
third question.

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:40.150
The first is Glaucon's claim
that people act justly

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.340
unwillingly.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.120
That the only reason people act
and conform with the laws

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.760
of morality is because
they will gain

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.130
good reputation thereby.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.760
And the second is Glaucon's
claim that they

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.368
are right to do so.

00:12:58.368 --> 00:13:02.875
So the text begins with a
fundamental contrast. One that

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:07.330
is useful, not only in the
context of Glaucon's

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.200
discussion of justice, but one
that is fundamental throughout

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.720
Plato's work.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.340
And that's the contrast between
the way things seem

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.980
and the way things are.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:29.170
And it's a crucial insight to
recognize that seeming and

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:35.500
being can come apart, and that
in some cases, our concern is

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.870
with the way things appear,
and in other cases, our

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.480
concern is with the
way things are.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.030
So the text actually begins with
a challenge that Glaucon

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.100
raises to Socrates.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.162
He says: do you want to seem to
have persuaded us that it

00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:56.670
is better to be just than
unjust, or do you want truly

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.610
to have persuaded us?

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.490
And clearly, Socrates's
goal is the latter.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.510
He wants to engage in
true persuasion.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.990
This theme of seeming versus
being is then taken up by

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:19.620
Glaucon, who asks Socrates the
question, whether there's

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:26.650
value in being just or whether
the value of justice comes

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:32.550
merely from appearing
to be that way.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.740
So we find a contrast in the
opening pages between three

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.070
kinds of values that things
can have. Things can be

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.620
intrinsically valuable,
valuable as ends in

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:53.070
themselves, valuable
for what they are.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.800
Socrates gives the example here
of things like joy, and

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.560
harmless pleasure.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.085
These are things we value not
because of what they provide

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:07.750
in addition, but things that
we value as ends in

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.158
themselves.

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:13.200
There are, by contrast,
things that are merely

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.790
instrumentally valuable.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.980
Things that are valuable
as means.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.850
Things that are valuable in
enabling us to do something

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.890
else, or in seeming to
be a particular way.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.910
And into this category fall
things like money, which is

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:37.370
valuable, let me remind you, not
as an end in itself, but

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.600
as a means to other ends.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.740
And, for example, things
like seeming dangerous.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.660
It's what you're trying to do
in an evolutionary sense, or

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.980
as a nation, is to prevent
others from attacking you, it

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.520
doesn't matter whether
you are dangerous.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.226
What matters is that
you seem dangerous.

00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:05.520
And there are, of course, things
that are valuable for

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.260
both of these.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.900
Things like, Socrates says,
sight, which we value both

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.940
because it enables us to do
things, and because it brings

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.150
pleasure in itself.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.420
Or health.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.450
Or learning.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.010
Or knowledge.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:30.880
And the question which Glaucon
and Socrates are disputing is,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.320
into which category
justice falls.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.770
Now, if we had our clickers,
this would be a chance for me

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.873
to reengage all of you by asking
you into which category

00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:47.450
Glaucon thinks justice falls,
and into which category

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.650
Socrates thinks justice falls.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.990
But in our last low-tech day,
I will instead ask you to

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.660
raise your hands.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.480
Into which of the categories,
intrinsically valuable,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.280
instrumentally valuable, or
both, does Glaucon think

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.830
justice falls?

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.740
How many think he thinks
justice is merely

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.310
intrinsically valuable?

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.720
How many think he thinks
it's merely

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.130
instrumentally valuable?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.950
And how many think he
thinks it's both?

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.610
By contrast, Socrates.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.710
Intrinsically valuable.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.980
Instrumentally valuable.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.088
Both.

00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:35.930
So it's a dispute
between them.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.820
Both of them expect that there
is value to seeming just, but

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.860
the dispute between them is
about whether, in addition,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.074
there is value to being just.
Does it matter that you

00:17:52.074 --> 00:17:56.970
actually act in a just way, or
does it matter only that you

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.180
seem to act in a just way?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.720
Now, in order to answer this
question, Glaucon, as a

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.400
character in Plato's Republic,
makes use of a technique that

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.850
is and has become one of the
fundamental techniques in

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.780
philosophical thought.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.000
It's basically an application
of scientific

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.766
method to our idea.

00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:31.680
If you're trying to figure out
what makes a seed grow, does

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.660
it require soil, does it require
water, does it require

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.200
light, does it require air, does
it require you to sing

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.950
sweetly as you walk past it?

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.370
What you do is, you conduct a
controlled experiment, and you

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.990
look and see: If you have the
seed with water but no soil,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.140
does it grow?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.790
If you have a seed with air but
no singing, does it grow?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:19:01.070
In this way, Glaucon engages
in a number of imaginative

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:07.930
exercises to ask what people
would do if just behavior were

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.510
divorced from its typical
consequences.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.470
So he asks us to imagine
somebody who acts either in a

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.170
just or an unjust way.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.360
And to think about what their
motivations would be if the

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.460
consequences were one
of a certain kind.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:36.400
So in ordinary cases, if you act
morally, you are perceived

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.875
as acting morally, and if you
act immorally, you are

00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:44.718
perceived as acting immorally.

00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:48.530
The question that he asks us
to consider in the story of

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.324
the ring of Gyges, which I
related last lecture, is how

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:57.520
people would act if they were
perceived identically,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.565
regardless of how it is that
they genuinely behave. If your

00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:09.330
act of immorality were invisible
to the world, if you

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:16.010
could behave immorally and
nobody would see you, so that

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:21.170
your reputation remained
unscathed, how is it that you

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.670
would behave?

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.335
Glaucon's suggestion with the
story of the ring of Gyges is

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:31.470
that under those circumstances,
you would

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:36.190
behave as the unjust one does.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.464
But in case you aren't convinced
by that story, he

00:20:40.464 --> 00:20:43.430
tells a second story after
the ring of Gyges.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.196
It's the story of the inversion,
and he says this.

00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:53.510
Suppose the person who acts
justly is perceived by

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.895
everyone as acting unjustly,
and the person who acts

00:20:57.895 --> 00:21:03.480
unjustly is perceived
as acting justly.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.210
Would you continue to behave in
accord with the standards

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:16.980
of morality if the opposite
reputation attached to you?

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.310
Now, we can contrast this
question about morality with

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:27.490
two cases where it seems clear
in the first that we value

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.318
something merely instrumentally,
and where it

00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:35.090
seems clear in the second that
we value something both

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.510
intrinsically and
instrumentally.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:43.290
So if the act that you are
engaged in is one of taking a

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.570
repulsive medicine, and if under
normal circumstances

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.430
when you take the medicine, you
get better, and when you

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.340
don't take the medicine, you
stay ill, then you will

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.420
presumably, if you want to get
better, take the medicine.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.200
In a Gyges scenario, where
regardless of whether you take

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.350
the medicine, you get better,
you won't be inclined to take

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.680
the medicine.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.164
And certainly in an inverted
scenario, where if you take

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:13.340
the medicine, you'd stay ill,
and if you don't take it, you

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.550
get better, you won't be
inclined to take the medicine.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.780
When things are of merely
instrumental value, we can

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.914
read the motivation off
the consequences.

00:22:29.914 --> 00:22:33.174
The question is this.

00:22:33.174 --> 00:22:39.350
Is justice just like taking a
medicine, something that we

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.380
value because of an end that it
produces, but not because

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:49.990
of the medicine itself, or
is it more like sight?

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.250
Suppose that, as is the case in
normal circumstances, when

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.410
you see, you have visual
experience of the world, and

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.710
when you engage in motor
activity, you

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.560
don't bump into things.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.445
Because I can see this podium,
I'm able to regulate my body

00:23:07.445 --> 00:23:12.480
in such a way that I don't
bump into it In a ring of

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.570
Gyges scenario, I wouldn't
need to see to be able to

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:20.246
avoid bumping into the podium.

00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:24.760
It seems to me clear that in
that case, I would nonetheless

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.250
prefer to have vision, even if
I could get the consequences

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.744
of seeing without
having vision.

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:36.450
And the question of what I would
do in the inverted case,

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.890
where I could have either sight
and the ability to avoid

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:45.930
objects, or the ability to avoid
objects and not sight,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:50.160
is one where I don't
know how to answer.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:56.270
So the challenge that Glaucon
poses to you is the following.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.090
Is morality, for you, something

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.272
merely like taking medicine?

00:24:02.272 --> 00:24:07.610
Do you behave morally so that
you have the reputation of

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:13.070
behaving morally, or do you
behave morally because

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:18.230
morality, like being able to
see, is something that's

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:23.950
valuable in itself to you, and
valuable to you because of the

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.000
consequences that it produces?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.750
That's the challenge of
Plato's Republic.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.910
And in next week's class, and
the week after that, we'll

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.740
hear some of answers
that are offered

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.750
to Glaucon's challenge.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:49.880
What I want to move to now is
the second text that we read

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.500
for today, a text by the
contemporary psychologist

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.570
Daniel Batson, which addresses
the question of moral

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.970
integrity and moral hypocrisy
from an empirical

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.110
psychological perspective.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.060
Batson's question is this.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:21.050
Is it the aim of people to be
moral, or is it the aim of

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:27.090
people merely to appear
to be so?

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.630
Baston looks somewhat unlike
Plato and Socrates.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.700
He's a living man.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.680
Teaches at the University
of Kansas.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.595
He even has a computer
printer.

00:25:40.716 --> 00:25:45.980
And in the work that we read
for today, we get a

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.805
description of empirical studies
that Batson did on the

00:25:49.805 --> 00:25:54.540
question of how people behave
when they think they are not

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.080
being observed.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.562
How do they think through their
actions to themselves,

00:26:01.562 --> 00:26:06.180
and what factors, if any,
lead them to behave

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.954
in more honest ways?

00:26:09.954 --> 00:26:14.850
So Batson presents subjects
with a very simple

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.450
experimental scenario.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.650
People who participate in his
experiment come into his

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:27.695
laboratory, and they're told
that their job is to decide

00:26:27.695 --> 00:26:32.450
which of two tasks they are
assigned to, and which of two

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.500
tasks a second person, whom they
won't be meeting, will be

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.070
assigned to.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.740
One of the tasks is fun and
interesting, and each correct

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.930
answer that you give provides
you with a lottery ticket for

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.290
a lottery in which you'll win
a certain amount of money.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.850
And the other task is described
as kind of dull, and

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.470
each correct answer that you
give will not result in your

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.660
being entered in the lottery.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.400
So people are told, you can
decide to assign yourself to

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.180
the fun, interesting
lottery-chance task and the

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.730
other person to the boring, no
lottery task, or you can

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.100
decide to assign the other
person to the fun, interesting

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.680
task, and yourself to the
boring, no lottery task.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.530
Now, what psychologists call the
DV, or dependent variable,

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.980
the thing with respect to which
Batson is looking for

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:38.935
differences, is the percentage
of times people assign

00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:43.170
themselves to the positive task,
and the other person to

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.110
the neutral task.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.470
So if we were just doing it by
chance, if you were literally

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:53.870
just flipping a coin, what
percent of the time would the

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.360
self-positive task
be assigned?

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.070
What percent of the time would
the person assign themselves

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.880
to the positive task?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.272
Hold up the number of fingers
times 10, such that it would

00:28:05.272 --> 00:28:06.590
be that percent of the time.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.440
You've got them on
one hand: 50%.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.252
So if you were just merely
flipping a coin, 50% of the

00:28:14.252 --> 00:28:17.320
time you would end up with the
positive task, 50% of the

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.566
time, the other person would end
up with the positive task.

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:24.240
So that's one of the things
that Batson is

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.480
measuring in his study.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.310
And the other thing that Batson
is measuring is in his

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:34.900
study is the point value that
people assign to themselves

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.480
with respect to how moral
their action was.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.260
If they think their action was
perfectly moral in making the

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.130
assignment, then they give
themselves a nine.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.730
If they think the action was
perfectly immoral in making

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.740
the assignments, they give
themselves a one.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.580
So those are the things that
Batson is measuring.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.480
So that's psychology
term number one.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.260
Dependent variable.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.420
That at which you're looking
to see differences among in

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.570
your study.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.720
Now, those of you who have taken
psychology courses, who

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.700
have had roommates who have
taken psychology courses, know

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.750
that when psychology studies
are conducted, subjects are

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.720
presented with what are
called conditions.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.470
That is, when they come in, one
thing happens to them or

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.350
another thing happens to them.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.497
The bean that I described in the
science study might be in

00:29:31.497 --> 00:29:35.475
the condition where it has soil
plus water and no air, or

00:29:35.475 --> 00:29:38.950
it might be in the condition
where it has soil plus singing

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.110
and no water.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:46.415
Likewise, subjects in Batson's
experiment might be in a case

00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:47.850
where they just have come in,
and they're told there are

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.750
these two possibilities.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.530
You can assign yourself positive
or this other person

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:57.350
negative, or they're told that
they're in some sort of

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:02.590
scenario where they can use
chance to make the decision.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.310
Now, I asked you in the reading
guide to try to

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:12.690
understand the chart in which
Batson presents his results.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.720
And what I want to do in the
next few minutes of lecture,

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.480
is to explain to you what the
extraordinarily interesting

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.370
results that he came up mean.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:29.240
So in the first condition, when
subjects just come in,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.304
and are told they can make the
assignment however they want,

00:30:33.304 --> 00:30:39.020
80% of subjects, 8 out of 10,
assign themselves to the

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.630
positive condition and assign
the other character to the

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.720
negative condition.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:45.910
Right?

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.295
So 80% of people do the selfish
thing, but they don't

00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:52.030
consider themselves to
have done something

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.055
particularly generous.

00:30:54.055 --> 00:30:57.740
They rate themselves at four
on a scale of one to nine,

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.300
with respect to morality.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.290
And those who assign the other
person to the positive

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.410
condition rate themselves
extraordinarily highly.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.830
They think they have done
the right thing.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.520
Now, if you bring subjects
into a room, and you tell

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.538
them, they can flip a coin,
but they don't have to,

00:31:17.538 --> 00:31:21.920
roughly half of them don't
flip the coin.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.830
And among those half, 90% of
them still assign themselves

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.600
to the positive condition.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.620
No surprise there.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.040
The next number is the
one that gives us

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.910
the surprising results.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:42.750
What happens when subjects come
into the room, are told

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:48.770
that they can flip a coin, flip
a coin, and on the basis

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.470
of that coin flip, assign
themselves to one condition,

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:57.160
and the other person
to the other?

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:03.480
What happens is that upon
flipping the coin, 90% of them

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.180
assign themselves to the
positive condition.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:13.000
Now, we all just held up five
fingers of one hand.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.040
So what's going on here?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.930
Well, why don't you think about
what would happen if you

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:22.690
flipped the coin, and
it he came up heads?

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:23.750
What does heads mean?

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.800
Ah, heads!

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.125
Heads must mean I assign
myself to the positive

00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:30.530
condition, and I assign
my opponent to

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.480
the negative condition.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.820
Comes up tails.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.380
Tails.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:33.980
Hah.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.600
Tails!

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.815
That means I assign myself to
the positive condition, I

00:32:37.815 --> 00:32:40.240
assign my opponent to the
negative condition.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.620
But here's what's striking.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:48.050
90% of the people flipped the
coin, assigned themselves to

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:54.040
the positive condition, and
rate themselves as having

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.500
acted in an extraordinarily
moral way.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.330
Seven on a scale of nine, with
respect to how morally they

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.420
behave. And the one guy who
actually did follow the coin

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.826
flip, gives himself a nine.

00:33:09.826 --> 00:33:10.288
All right.

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:13.260
So Batson's worried about this,
and so he says, OK.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.110
Let me see whether I can control
for that by actually

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.550
not making the coins
say heads or tails.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:22.508
I'll make the coins say, on one
side, self to positive,

00:33:22.508 --> 00:33:23.910
and I'll make it say
on the other

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.420
side, opponent to negative.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.144
What happens in that case?

00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:30.270
What happens in that case is
that 86% of the people who

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.820
flip up the coin when it says,
opponent to negative, do what?

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.040
What would you do?

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.690
You flip it again, until it
comes up--"That's not the one

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.580
that counts!

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.850
The one that counts is--oh, oh,
it must be the fourteenth

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.740
flip that actually determines."
And those people,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.430
again, rate themselves as having
acted in an incredibly

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.790
morally appropriate way.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:34:00.940
Even when Batson labels it with
colors, so that he can

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:06.700
see through the window who is
doing what, he gets the same

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.915
extraordinary, astounding
pattern of results.

00:34:11.915 --> 00:34:17.700
In eight out of ten, nine out
of ten cases, people, given

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:22.745
the chance to represent to
themselves that they have

00:34:22.745 --> 00:34:29.450
behaved morally, will do that
even if what they've really

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:34.420
done is taking advantage of
an ambiguous situation.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.376
It appears, says Batson on the
basis of this, that what

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:44.230
people care about is seeming
moral to themselves, and not,

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:50.200
in fact, about acting in
a way that's fair.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.750
But what can one do to
induce in people

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.580
prosocial moral behaviors?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:06.310
Here's the extraordinary next
study that Batson did.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.580
He put the subjects, who
are engaged in the same

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:18.220
experimental design, in
a room with a mirror.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.180
Now, if the mirror is facing
away from the subject so that

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.750
there's no reflection of them
in it, you get exactly the

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.420
same results as last time.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.430
Roughly 85% of people
assign themselves to

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.990
the positive condition.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:40.590
But if the mirror is facing
towards them, so that the

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:47.295
subject is facing the mirror and
flips the coin, only 62%

00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:52.355
of them assign themselves to
the positive condition.

00:35:52.355 --> 00:35:55.850
And so if the mirror's facing
them, even when they don't

00:35:55.850 --> 00:36:00.140
flip the coin, 62% of them
assign themselves to the

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.030
positive condition, that is,
that they're behaving almost

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.830
completely fairly.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:09.030
And if they are facing the
mirror and flipping the coin,

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:16.560
they behave 50% exactly as
chance would predict.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.980
What's going on here?

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:27.110
It looks like the simple act
of feeling as if one is

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:33.370
observed, even when one is
observed by oneself, is

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.396
sufficient to provoke
prosocial behavior.

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:41.697
And an extraordinary study,
carried out about five years

00:36:41.697 --> 00:36:45.994
ago in England, bears
that out.

00:36:45.994 --> 00:36:50.090
So in this study, there was an
honor system about putting

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:56.490
money into a cup if you drank
coffee in the department.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.440
And some weeks, taped above the
cup of the coffee machine

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.450
were pictures of flowers.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.070
There's the flowers,
there's the

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.640
flowers, there's the flowers.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.240
And those weeks, almost nobody
put money into the pot.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.716
The other half of the week
taped above the pot

00:37:16.716 --> 00:37:19.570
were pairs of eyes.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:25.240
And those weeks, subject donated
large amounts of money

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.200
into the pot.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.070
There is something about us as
social beings that encourages

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:39.520
us to behave in moral ways
when activated within us,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.340
consciously or unconsciously,
is the

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.820
scent of being observed.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.610
If you want to complete your
assignment without

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:55.220
procrastinating, put a pair of
eyes on your computer and a

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.630
mirror behind your desk.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.680
I kid you not.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:06.720
The profound and shocking
insight of Glaucon's story of

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.900
Gyges in Plato's Republic is, in
light of this contemporary

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.810
research, almost chilling.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:19.796
That he would tell the story
of how it is that we can

00:38:19.796 --> 00:38:25.970
expect somebody to behave if
he conceives of himself as

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.310
unobserved--the story of our
shepherd, who finds the ring

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.910
of invisibility, and when he
gets it takes over the

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:42.560
kingdom--is the story that
Batson's research tells us

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.280
about an inclination on the
part of human beings.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:53.890
There is a worrisome tendency on
the part of at least those

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.580
about whom these stories
are told.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.810
That is, ancient Greek
civilization seemed to feel

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.110
that this rings true.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:07.870
Contemporary American college
students in Kansas seem to

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.690
bear that out.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:15.656
When we think of ourselves as
unobserved, it is difficult to

00:39:15.656 --> 00:39:21.850
act in conformity with
moral codes.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.040
And the question which will
reoccur throughout this

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.790
semester--both in the unit on
morality and in the unit on

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:33.430
political philosophy--is the
question of how society can be

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:39.390
structured in such a way that
there are the equivalent of

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:47.507
eyes above our computers and
mirrors in our room so that we

00:39:47.507 --> 00:39:54.860
can act in keeping with rules
that allow societies to

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.040
provide the kind of stability
that allows

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.130
human beings to flourish.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:05.950
So we have a couple of minutes
left, and let me just ask what

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.762
questions you have about
today's lecture.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.560
Questions?

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.500
STUDENT: Would you talk about
the consequences of

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.925
[INAUDIBLE] morality,
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.000
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.290
So the question is, when I talk
about the consequences of

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.520
morality, I've restricted
discussion's consequences for

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.925
you, things like your
reputation.

00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:42.420
And the question is, what
about other sorts of

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.110
consequences?

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.630
What about when acting
in immoral ways

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.040
brings harm to others?

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.170
One of the things that we'll
talk about next week, and

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.360
again is the section on justice,
is human beings'

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.312
capacity for empathy and
sympathy, and the ways in

00:40:58.312 --> 00:41:02.925
which those features might be
leveraged to help do some of

00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:06.052
the prosocial work that
mirrors and eyes do.

00:41:06.052 --> 00:41:07.466
So excellent question.

00:41:07.466 --> 00:41:09.410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] when
Glaucon is talking about it,

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.050
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
when Glaucon is talking about

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.880
it, is he only talking about
issues of reputation?

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.820
So there's a very interesting
thing going on in Book 2 of

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.550
The Republic.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:25.094
Glaucon and Adeimantus are
taking on a conversation that

00:41:25.094 --> 00:41:29.060
Socrates has been having with
Thrasymachus in book one about

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.740
recitation.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.600
So that's part of why that's
being invoked as a reason.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.190
But there are also, you'll hear,
when Socrates gives his

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.910
answer, it's about the integrity
of the person who

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.120
acts in moral or immoral ways.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.810
And what Socrates is basically
going to go on to say is, it

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.300
may seem to you like all you
care about is what you appear

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.050
to be to others.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.760
But as a matter of fact, when
you let your soul get out of

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.720
order, when you behave in ways
that are impulsive, that are

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.940
insensitive to the needs of
others, you, yourself will be

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.100
unable to flourish.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.620
And that's the answer we're
going to be exploring Glaucon

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.430
hasn't raised that as
a question yet.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.890
Socrates is going to introduce
it into the conversation.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.990
Good.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.420
It is 11:20.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.405
I hope that the density of
today's lecture doesn't scare

00:42:22.405 --> 00:42:23.680
off too many of you.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.761
It gets more more
fun after this.

00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:29.380
And I look forward to seeing
many of you next week.

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:04.300
Yesterday,
Monday's lecture,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.400
we were outlining the
expectations of the course

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.467
conceptually and practically.

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.900
Conceptually, remember
that I started with

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.767
Frederick Douglass' - an
excerpt from his great

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.600
speech, "What to the slave
is the Fourth of July?,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.300
 told the story about
how he had been honored,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
in a sense, by his
abolitionist friends to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.867
come to Rochester to
speak about the meaning of

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.100
independence,
Fourth of July,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.200
how he refused to do so,
because to proceed in that

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
way for a man
who'd been a slave and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.500
self-emancipated,
represented in so many

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
ways the enslaved
population of the United

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.400
States, that to invite him
to speak about liberty and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.500
independence was "cruel
mockery." We also talked

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
about the ways in which,
going back from Frederick

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.367
Douglass's
speech in the 1850s,

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:57.900
going back to the 1770s
with the epitaph on the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
tombstone, about the
ways in which freedom and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.100
slavery intertwined,
if you're trying to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.800
understand this
country's history,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.367
and the way that
citizenship and

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.900
non-citizenship are
intertwined. I want to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.100
pick up on some of
those same themes today,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
and we are going to be
lingering for the most

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.100
part of this lecture just
prior to the start of the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.667
Civil War.
I'll offer a few,

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.000
I mean, scant details
chronologically about the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
Civil War, and end up with
the New York City draft

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.967
riots, happening in the
midst of the Civil War.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.200
And so this lecture is
really our jumping off

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.067
point, from a
chronological perspective,

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.900
for this course.
And as you see,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.800
by the end of the
lecture, some core themes,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.600
again that I
articulated on Monday,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.000
are going to be brought
back into focus by the end

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.200
of this narrative. So
I want to begin today's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.767
lecture with a poem
by the journalist,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:02.400
activist, Underground
Railroad host to those

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.467
slaves escaping towards
freedom (she would open

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:09.200
her doors to them),
woman's rights activist,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.700
anti-lynching crusader,
woman by the name of

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.467
Frances Ellen Watkins
Harper. It's a poem

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.800
written in 1854, the
same moment that Frederick

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.800
Douglass is castigating
his abolitionist friends

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.000
about their
understandings of freedom,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.867
and of liberty, and of
slavery. The poem is

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:35.067
called Bury Me in a Free
Land. And I want you to

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.800
listen. It's not--I'm not
going to say the poem is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.000
high art. It's
better than I can do,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but it's not high art, I
don't think. But think

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.400
about the images that
are crafted in this

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400
poem...sort of the
psychological terror

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.700
represented in this poem
as well. Bury Me in a Free

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.367
Land. "Make me a
grave where'er you will,

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:03.000
In a lowly plain,
or a loft hill;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.967
Make it among
earth's humblest graves,

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:09.800
But not in a land where
men are slaves. I could

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.767
not rest if around my grave I
heard the steps of

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.900
a trembling slave; His
shadow above my silent tomb

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.800
would make it a place
of fearful gloom. I could

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.600
not rest if I heard the
tread of a coffle gang to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.100
the shambles led, And the
mother's shriek of wild despair

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.000
Rise like a curse on the
trembling air.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.767
I could not sleep if I saw
the lash. Drinking her

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:36.200
blood with each
fearful gash,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.967
And I saw her babes
torn from her breast,

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:42.900
Like trembling doves from
their parent nest.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.800
I'd shudder and start if
I heard the bay

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.400
Of bloodhounds seizing
their human prey,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.800
And I heard the captive
plead in vain

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.200
As they bound afresh his galling
chain. If I saw young

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.500
girls from their mother's
arms, Bartered and sold for

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.100
their youthful charms, My
eye would flash with a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.800
mournful flame, My
death-paled cheek grow

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.200
red with shame, I would sleep

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.767
dear friends, where bloated
might, Can rob no

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.100
man of his
dearest right;

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.367
My rest shall be calm in
any grave, Where none can

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:19.800
call his brother a
slave. I ask no monument,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.300
proud and high, To
arrest the gaze of the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.867
passers-by; All that my
yearning spirit craves,

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:32.500
Is bury me not in a
land of slaves." Again,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.600
1854. Although the
literal start of the Civil

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.100
War is seven years away,
this was an era when it

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.067
was clear to people like
Frederick Douglass and

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.600
Frances Harper and so
many other individuals,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.867
free and not free. This
is an era of incredible

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:54.800
tension in the
country, and really the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.767
handwriting's on the wall
as the country's barreling

00:04:56.767 --> 00:05:03.700
towards its sectional
crisis. As early as 1820,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.767
the political battles had
begun with the Missouri

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:09.900
Compromise, an attempt
to balance the number of

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.300
slave states and free
states. The Missouri

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.100
Compromise angered the
South because of the way

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.100
the federal government
intervened in this

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.300
process. You're going to
hear this often in this

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.467
course. The tension
between federal government

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:31.000
initiatives and states'
rights initiatives. Who

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.800
has greater authority, the
federal government or the

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.367
states? Fundamentally
important to the post--or

00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:37.700
to the African
American experience,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.367
pre- and
post-emancipation. So in

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.600
1820 at the
Missouri Compromise,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.300
balancing free
states and slave states,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.367
so neither would have an
advantage in the federal

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:53.400
government when it came to
setting policy about labor

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400
in particular. Fast forward,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.600
1850, the
Compromise of 1850,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.800
essentially the same
issues as in the Missouri

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.700
Compromise. It's relating
to territory gained in the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.567
Mexican-American War. What part
of the United

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:13.067
States is going to be free
versus what part is going

00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:16.867
to be--or what states are
going to allow slavery.

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:21.300
One of the most important
texts in US history,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.567
novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin,
is published in 1852,

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:30.567
written by Harriet Beecher
Stowe. Quite a long time

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.267
before Oprah's Book Club,
the book sells in numbers

00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:40.000
that are astonishing.
Three hundred thousand

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.467
copies of this text
are put into print,

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.467
and eventually, over a
million copies are sold.

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:49.100
This is in 1852.
It's--the numbers are sort

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.300
of incomparable to today.
The importance of the book

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.467
is that it galvanizes
through this sort of very

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:01.000
romantic and
treacley novel--it reads

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.900
very...it's an interesting
read in our contemporary

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.500
ears--but it galvanizes so
much of Northern opinion

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.567
about slavery
and, frankly,

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:14.600
helps pull this
country apart,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.800
looking
backwards. In 1854,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.600
you have the
Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.400
that wipes out the
Missouri Compromise of

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.200
thirty-four years earlier
and starts a bloody war,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.300
essentially a civil
war within Kansas about

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.700
whether we're
going to have slave

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.600
territories--slave states
or free states in these

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.300
areas. Out of the
battles in Kansas,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.800
the Republican Party
emerges. It didn't exist

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.600
before. And it would
become the party that was

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.100
most sympathetic to
the African American

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.767
experience--African
Americans' interests in

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.000
becoming free and having
citizenship rights. It

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.900
becomes the party
with which blacks would

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.900
affiliate until
nineteen--the mid-1930s.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.400
Now this takes us up
to around 1857. Again,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.000
I'm fast-forwarding
through a lot of history

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.067
here, just to get to some
of the main themes of this

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:21.600
lecture. So the country
is being ripped apart

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.367
through a variety of
federal and state legal

00:08:24.367 --> 00:08:27.500
battles about where people
can be free and where they

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.967
cannot, what states
can support slavery,

00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:37.100
recognize it as being
legal. During all these

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.400
battles, a court case
is winding through the

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.700
system, a legal case, and
it's finally decided in

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.800
1857 by the Supreme
Court, Scott v. Sanders,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.200
more famously, the Dred
Scott case. Now it's a

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.300
complicated case,
which I'll reduce to its

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.500
simplest forms. It's a
complicated case that

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:07.467
revolves around travel,
essentially. North of the

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:11.367
line thirty-six degrees
and thirty minutes related

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:13.367
to the Missouri Compromise
and the battles in Kansas

00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:16.400
and Nebraska,
north of that line,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.767
the country is--these are
free states. South of the

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.000
line, you're in
slave-holding

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.200
territories. Dred Scott
lives on both sides of

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.800
this line. He's a slave.
Sorry if I didn't make

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.467
that part clear. He's a
slave and lives with his

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:36.800
master and his mistress on
both sides of this line,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.400
on and off over the course
of much of his life. And

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.767
for much of a decade, he's
living in free territory.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.300
When his master
dies in 1846,

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.867
Scott sues for his freedom
on the ground that he had

00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:59.500
been living in free
territory. "You can't own

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.300
me, I've been living
in a place that doesn't

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.300
recognize that status."
So he sues in court. The

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.300
courts go back and forth
until the Supreme Court

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.700
issues the final decision
in 1857. Eleven years

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:26.200
have transpired since the
original suit. And in the

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.800
course of these
cases--these decisions

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.100
going back and forth,
Dred Scott and his family,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.900
if you can imagine,
have been emancipated,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.400
re-enslaved,
emancipated, re-enslaved,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.667
depending on the court's
decision. He's living a

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.167
life in a terrible--I mean
a limbo that we really

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:46.100
can't imagine. Well, the
Supreme Court weighs in

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.300
and solves the matter
once and for all. Chief

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.300
Justice Roger B. Taney
writes a decision that is

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.900
quite notable. He says
that Scott should remain a

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.500
slave, that by
virtue of his slavery,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.200
he is not a citizen
of the United States,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200
and so could not bring
suit in a federal court in

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.000
the first place. He wipes
out the whole process.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.267
"You were never a citizen,
because you were a slave.

00:11:14.267 --> 00:11:15.600
You didn't have the
right to sue." Moreover,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.000
Taney says,
that as a slave,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.800
he was personal property,
and personal property can

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.367
never become free. We
think of personal property

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:33.200
as inanimate objects.
Certainly African American

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.400
slaves were not inanimate,
but for Taney it didn't

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.600
matter.
That's a gray area,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.700
I mean if you could
call it a gray area,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.000
that for Taney, that was a
gray area that was really

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.800
reduced to something
simple: They were personal

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.867
property; they could
not become free. Adding

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:51.100
insult to injury--I mean
the decision gets just

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.400
better and better from
the standpoint of raising

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.067
one's bile--Taney
makes plain his opinion of

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:01.000
blacks. "They
were," he offered,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and this is a quote, "so
far inferior that they had

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.600
no rights which a
white man was bound to

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.500
respect." "They were so
far inferior that they had

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.000
no rights which a
white man was bound to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.700
respect." So
in one decision,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.767
he eliminates
even the chance,

00:12:21.767 --> 00:12:26.300
from a legal standpoint,
that you could sue if you

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.500
had been a slave. He
says that's not even a

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.900
possibility. Furthermore,
you're property and you

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.667
weren't free ever, and now
we shouldn't even respect

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:38.400
you anyway, because you're
so far inferior. Taney's

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.800
decision, building upon
the legislative battles of

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.167
the previous thirty-seven
years at that point,

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:51.167
building upon the tension
that's exacerbated,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.500
I suppose, might
be the right word,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.667
with Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Taney's decision helps

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:01.100
move the country closer
to Civil War because it

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.167
infuriates anti-slavery
advocates. On so many

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:08.067
levels of his decision, he
has made the wrong choice,

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:10.500
philosophically,
ethically and legally,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.300
according to anti-slavery
advocates. The new

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.800
Republican Party which was
opposed to the expansion

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.100
of slavery--now notice,
it's the expansion,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.900
not wiping it all out.
Things take time. The

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.867
Republican Party, which is
opposed to the expansion

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:29.367
of slavery, criticized
the decision. There's a

00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:32.100
postscript to
this. In 1857,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.667
we don't want to lose
sight of Dred Scott

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:36.500
himself.
Scott's mistress,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500
his master's
widowed--widow,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.300
Dred Scott's mistress
remarries and gives Scott

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.500
and his family their
freedom. Now why she

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.700
couldn't do this eleven
years earlier is a mystery

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.600
that, you know,
only she could answer,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.567
I suppose. But she gives
him and his family their

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:59.700
final freedom. And if you
remember the epitaph from

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.900
Monday, I mean
the painful,

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.267
bitter irony of
the whole process,

00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:07.100
just like John Jack.
Not long after he buys his

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.767
freedom, he dies. One year
after Dred Scott finally

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:13.400
gets his freedom, an
eleven-year battle in the

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.900
legal system, one
year later he dies from

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:22.167
tuberculosis. It's a
bitter coda to a life of

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:28.467
struggle. So Dred
Scott dies in 1858.

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:29.967
Steadying--Continuing
this March,

00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:37.867
1859, John Brown, former
principal of a seminary

00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:39.400
where Frances Harper,
whose poem I read to you

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.800
earlier, the principal of
the seminary where Frances

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.067
Harper worked, becomes
an evangelizing zealot

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:51.400
against--or for
anti-slavery causes.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.600
Slavery is
inhumane. It's unholy,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.600
according to John Brown,
and he recognizes--or he

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.400
believes the way to
solve this problem,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.300
since the legal
process isn't working,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.367
since the process of moral
suasion isn't working,

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:12.900
is to get guns. John
Brown organizes a band of

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.600
armed abolitionists,
black and white men,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.867
and their plan is to storm
the arsenal in Harpers

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:23.600
Ferry, Virginia. John
Brown invites Frederick

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.667
Douglass. "You're such
an important leader for

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.167
African Americans. You
need to join us in this

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:29.700
battle." And
Douglass says--I mean,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.767
I wasn't there for
the conversation,

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:34.267
but--"John, you're
crazy." And he may have

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:37.467
been a bit, well,
visionary I suppose is

00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:41.467
another word for crazy
in sometimes. He forms a

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:45.467
group, John Brown
does, and they begin their

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:49.367
raid. Doesn't last
very long. Robert E. Lee,

00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:51.167
general in the
United States army,

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:57.200
not yet a traitor, quickly
defeats John Brown and his

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.700
associates. Brown is
wounded in the battle and

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.167
he's captured,
and in short order,

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:06.767
he's convicted of treason,
and he's ultimately

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:10.700
hanged. Between
the time of the raid,

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.567
or when he's
caught that is,

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:17.000
and his hanging, there's
a trial. And during that

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.200
trial, John Brown becomes
seen as a messianic hero

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.600
to many people.
Frances Harper,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.467
again, has a note sent to
John Brown when he's in

00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:35.900
prison that reads in part,
and I'm quoting from it

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.300
here, "In the name of the
young girl sold from the,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.600
excuse me, In the name of
the young girl sold from

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.400
the warm--warm clasp of
a mother's arms to the

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.800
clutches of a
libertine or profligate,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.700
in the name of
the slave mother,

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.400
her heart rocked to and
fro by the agony of her

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.400
mournful
separations, I thank you,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.767
that you have been brave
enough to reach out your

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.300
hands to the crushed
and blighted of my race,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.367
I thank you." Brown
himself fanned the flames

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:16.400
of celebrity during
the trial with long

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.700
soliloquies, all to no
avail. He's going to be

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.467
hung. Some of his last
famous--his famous last

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:32.900
words. He declares,
"I believe that to have

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.100
interfered as I have done
on behalf of this despised

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:43.467
poor, I did no wrong,
but right." To the end,

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.167
he was quite
certain his path,

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:49.800
armed resistance, was the
solution to a country that

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.800
could not figure
itself out on this issue,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.000
whether it be a
slave holding country,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
non-slave holding country
or some strange mix. John

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.600
Brown's raid in 1860,
Abraham Lincoln's elected

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.100
in 1860. Simplifying
a complicated story,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.700
but essentially, the South
has no electoral presence

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:22.267
in the election, and it
felt that the Union was

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:27.067
doomed, and Southern
states begin to secede.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:38.000
April of 1861, the Civil
War starts. Lincoln wants

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.800
to preserve the
Union at all costs,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.900
and tries from the very
start to lure the South

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.367
back in with a plan of
compensated emancipation.

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:54.467
Essentially, "We'll pay
for your slaves. You

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:59.667
emancipate them, we give
you some money." Many

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:01.900
people in the North balk
at this idea. This is

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.267
crazy. And the South
completely refuses.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.500
Lincoln tries to develop a
colonization plan to move

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.400
blacks to Latin America.
Now this is part of a

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.500
longer tradition. Lincoln
didn't just create an idea

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.400
of like solving the race
problem by getting rid of

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.767
the race. This has been
going back to this point

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:31.600
through
colonization societies,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.167
thirty, forty,
fifty years,

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:34.900
and then in terms
of individual ideas,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.100
much longer. But
Lincoln thinks,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.400
"Well this is a solution.
We've got a problem with

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.100
slaves. Slaves were black
in this country." There's

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.200
also Native
American slaves,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.500
but a much smaller
population. "We'll just

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.800
move them." That plan
doesn't work out either.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.300
Now Lincoln has an
evolutionary viewpoint

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.300
when it comes to slavery,
in terms of its role in

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.400
society, pragmatically,
how it affected the Union,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.700
the sustainability
of the Union,

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.300
or the possibility of
reconciliation of the

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.067
Union. He doesn't
support slavery,

00:20:13.067 --> 00:20:15.767
but he could not find
a way to eliminate it,

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.400
and try to preserve or
reconcile the Union.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.900
Political and pragmatic
pressures finally force

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.200
his hand. Congress had
already begun to chip away

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.567
at slavery by refusing to
allow captured slaves to

00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:35.567
be returned to their
bonded status. And with

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.467
just a little over a
year after the Civil War

00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:41.400
begins, Lincoln
essentially throws up his

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.100
hands. He goes, "There's
really no--there's no way

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.800
to solve this
problem," and decides that

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.600
emancipation is going to
be the solution. How are

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.667
we going to do it? What's
it going to look like? By

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:56.800
the end of the year, he's
drawn up the plans and

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.400
enunciated the policy
and on January 1st,

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.900
1863, the Emancipation
Proclamation takes

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.600
effect. Now the
proclamation is a

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:15.067
fascinating document.
It's compromised,

00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:18.900
as most political things
are. It's a manifestation

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.500
of compromise and it
declares that the slave

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.100
population in any state
that's still in rebellion

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.900
against the United States
on January 1863--slave

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.167
populations in those
states that are in

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:33.467
rebellion against the
federal government,

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:36.367
against the United States,
at that moment would

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:42.367
become free. Now what
does this mean? It means,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.100
curiously, not much in
a practical sense. If

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.300
you're in South Carolina,
you own slaves. Your

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:02.467
state had seceded from the
union. Lincoln says on

00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:04.467
January 1863, "You
don't own those slaves

00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:06.867
anymore." Well, if
you're in South Carolina,

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.400
you don't care what
Lincoln says. You still

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.800
own your slaves.
In Maryland though,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.600
which sided
with the Union,

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.700
if I had a plantation that
owned slaves and I was in

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.800
Maryland, my state is not
in rebellion against the

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.067
U.S., I still own my
slaves. Now slavery in

00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:27.600
Maryland is different from
slavery in South Carolina

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.100
on the level of type of
slavery and also scale of

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.300
it. So in terms of
literally freeing people,

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.667
the Emancipation
Proclamation doesn't. It

00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:42.567
is still one of the most
important documents in the

00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:45.367
history of the
United States,

00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:46.867
because when you
think of politics,

00:22:46.867 --> 00:22:48.767
there's the literal
effects and there's the

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:52.667
philosophical or cultural,
symbolic effects. You

00:22:52.667 --> 00:22:55.367
think of the Emancipation
Proclamation in that way,

00:22:55.367 --> 00:23:01.367
it is an astonishing
document. The Civil War,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.900
the debates go on to
this day. The Civil War,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.100
was it a war about
slavery? Was it a war

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.800
about just different
economic systems? Was it

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.200
a war about political
philosophy? And people

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.300
still argue themselves
blue in the face. But

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.867
what is clear is that
at the moment of the

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:26.400
Emancipation Proclamation,
the Civil War does become

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.100
about slavery. Even if
you were fighting it for

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.667
some other reason, the
stakes are very real,

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:35.000
that if the North
wins, if the Union wins,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.100
slavery will be abolished
from the United States.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.600
Now let's head towards
these last sort of twenty

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.900
minutes of the lecture.
We're going to stick north

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:56.800
for a while here. Now
the war is about slavery,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.900
at least in this sort of
cultural politics of the

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.567
moment. It's a miserable
war. The South and the

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.300
North are beating
themselves up to a pulp

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.967
certainly, and Lincoln
faces a problem. The

00:24:09.967 --> 00:24:11.500
Union troops face a
problem. They don't have

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.800
enough people. And as we
head through the winter of

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:21.000
1863, Lincoln decides he
has to try to find a way

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.200
to raise the number of
troops that are available

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.600
to fight in these
wars--in this war,

00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:31.667
and you had the
Conscription Acts being

00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:35.100
passed, and they're going
to take effect in March of

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.067
1863. And what the
Conscription Acts say is

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:40.200
that there's mandatory
military service for men

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.700
who are between age twenty
and forty-five unless--and

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.700
there always seems to be
an unless when it comes to

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.000
conscription--unless
they happen to have three

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.900
hundred dollars on them.
If you had three hundred

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.500
dollars, you could buy
yourself an exemption.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.567
There's a long history
of that in this country,

00:24:58.567 --> 00:25:00.900
and many other places.
The history is still with

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.500
us today. Political
leaders bought their

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.000
exemption. It's
called--you know it's

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.900
called, "Daddy's a
powerful political

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.667
figure. I will not go to
war." Conscription Acts

00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:13.100
of March 1863 said if you
were between twenty and

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.600
forty-five, and
you were a man,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.867
you had to serve, unless
you could find three

00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:20.800
hundred dollars. Well,
three hundred dollars is a

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.800
huge sum of money, 1863,
so no surprise the wealthy

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.067
gave their money, and they
were exempt. Most of the

00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:38.400
country wasn't wealthy.
This was a way to raise

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.000
troops and also raise
money. They needed both.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.900
There was an unintended
effect. I don't think you

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.900
would have
been a surprise,

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.100
but it was an unintended
effect. It exacerbated

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.900
class tensions
within the country,

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.500
within the Union, I should
say. So as you're heading

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.200
into spring of 1863, the
battle is still going on.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.467
Young men are dying
left and right. The war,

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:10.400
what is this war about
really? Who is it for?

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.400
It's about emancipating
these black slaves. And

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.200
you head into March and
you had these Conscription

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.700
Acts taking place. "Now
I have no choice but to

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:29.300
go." Then you head
into the summer and these

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.867
tensions, wondering
what the war is about,

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:35.200
not having the resources
to get out of risking

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.667
one's life, for something
you're not sure if you

00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:44.900
even believe in. Class
tensions exacerbated. In

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:51.067
New York City, all of
these different tensions

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:56.267
combine and essentially
combust. What's going on

00:26:56.267 --> 00:27:00.600
in New York in particular?
In addition to those

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.200
things I just
mentioned, in New York,

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.967
there are labor tensions.
Really dramatic labor

00:27:05.967 --> 00:27:11.167
tensions. The Irish
immigrant population

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:16.200
treated horribly for quite
some time. The Irish

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.600
control the docks.
The Irish are already

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.800
struggling with local
blacks for that bottom

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.400
rung on the ladder. Who's
going to have a chance to

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.000
get a purchase on that
bottom rung and to start

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.300
to pull themselves up?
And the Irish dock workers

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.500
control this--these
important ports in New

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.267
York City.
Horrible, dirty,

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:46.567
messy, dangerous job,
but we're not going to let

00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:50.900
blacks take this job. So
there's tensions in labor

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.400
ranks in terms of who can
actually be the laborer to

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.400
start to pull themselves
up by their bootstraps.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:04.267
There is a fear adding
to this labor tension,

00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:07.300
has an ethnic and racial
aspect to it--there's a

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.700
fear now that
since January of 1863,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.100
since Lincoln
freed the slaves,

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.400
these slaves are going to
end up in New York City.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400
How they're going
to get there is,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.900
you know, another issue,
but there's going to be a

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.367
fear--there's a fear of
a flood of emancipated

00:28:23.367 --> 00:28:28.300
blacks coming up to New
York to find work. And

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.967
let's face it, these folks
had nothing. They'll take

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:34.100
any job, was the
expectation. And so the

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.200
Irish dock workers felt
even further antagonized

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.100
by the fact of job
insecurity and the fact

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.900
that this other,
these black folks,

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.900
were going to take
their jobs. Now as I said

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.167
before, the Irish, many of
them are brand new to this

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:58.900
country. They're
scrambling to secure their

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.800
own place as citizens in
this country. Looked down

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.300
upon, treated terribly by
other groups. And they

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.767
believed, aside from
wanting to keep these

00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:16.000
jobs, that their claim to
citizenship rested in part

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.267
at least upon the fact
that they were not black.

00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:23.400
This is a very important
point. It's not that it's

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:29.200
just about a job, but
about belonging. Irish

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.300
treated--like there'd
be signs in the stores,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.367
"No Irish or dogs allowed
in." Blacks already

00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:40.100
weren't allowed in. No
Irish or dogs. The Irish

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.100
were treated horribly,
and so they realized,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.200
as long as they are
not like that person,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200
those
people--"that person,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.700
 "those people" being
black. Having been

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.800
emancipated, whether they
were actually ever a slave

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.800
or not, they are--they
are tarred in a sense with

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.500
that same label, from an
enslaved people--people

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:07.200
who weren't citizens in
many people's minds. The

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.100
Irish workers say, "Well,
at least I'm not that,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:16.567
so I'm moving up the
ladder." So you take

00:30:16.567 --> 00:30:19.267
emancipation, you take
the Conscription Acts,

00:30:19.267 --> 00:30:20.700
which are certainly
affecting the Irish more

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.000
than any other population
in New York City,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.800
you take the fear of
emancipated blacks coming

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.100
up and taking jobs
away from the Irish dock

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.400
workers, and it makes it
plain that the Irish now

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.300
feel incredibly
compromised. Everything

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.200
they had fought for might
be in danger of slipping

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.200
away. Their freedom, as
I mentioned when talking

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.800
about John Jack and
citizens of Concord in

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.100
1773, Irish workers'
freedom was incumbent upon

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:57.100
blacks' slavery. They're
intertwined. Now we're

00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:02.500
into July of 1863, after
setting all this stage.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.067
On July 11th, a first
lottery is held for

00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:11.700
conscription. So
we've had this plan,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.467
now we're going to make
it real. And within two

00:31:16.467 --> 00:31:21.300
days, mayhem ensues. Now
New York is a port city.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.367
So aside from having the
dock workers unloading

00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:25.500
material goods
and products,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.867
or loading them
onto these ships,

00:31:27.867 --> 00:31:29.567
you have troops that
are being rallied from

00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:31.600
different places in the
Northeast that are coming

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.867
down to New York City, or
they're leaving from New

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:39.100
York to head further south
into the military battles,

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.800
into military stages,
scenes. And so there's

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.300
all this tension around
the military being there.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.400
And now, with the
Conscription Acts really

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.100
becoming--well
becoming real,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.900
people are going to
be forced to don the

00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:00.000
uniform. Several days
of rioting begin. The

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.500
military
command--commandant of the

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.000
region, anything
embodying military,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
or suggesting
police control,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:17.800
is targeted. So the
commandant is sought out.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.500
Soldiers are sought out,
police are sought out.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.800
They're targeted
by these gangs,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.500
largely ethnic gangs,
largely Irish gangs.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.300
They're the ones who felt
most at threat. And these

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.900
gangs also targeted
blacks. The call went out

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.700
from the commandant, "We
need more troops." Now it

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.267
takes a couple of
days, during 1863,

00:32:44.267 --> 00:32:47.900
to get people
there. After a few days,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.067
military troops are
brought in to the city to

00:32:51.067 --> 00:32:56.000
restore calm. When
the dust has settled,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.367
as many as a thousand
people are dead during

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:04.400
these riots. Anybody from
New York City? There's

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.567
got to be a couple of
people here. Well,

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:09.500
think of these
places: on the West Side,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.167
Twenty-Seventh
and Seventh Avenue,

00:33:12.167 --> 00:33:15.600
West Thirty-Third Street,
Thirty-Seventh and Seventh

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.400
Avenue. On the East Side,
Thirty-Fourth and East

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.667
River--a very
specific street--address,

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.667
One Hundred Forty-Seven
East Twenty-Eighth

00:33:24.667 --> 00:33:26.400
Street. All of
these sites that you

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.100
have--you've
walked around them,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:32.800
I know you have, these are
sites of lynchings in New

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.900
York City. We're not
talking about gangs

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.200
throwing rocks and beating
each other up. We are

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.000
talking about lynchings,
in addition to that as

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.100
well, I should
say. In total,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.500
eleven people are lynched
during the several days of

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.700
riots. A few
examples: Joseph Reed,

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.400
separated from his
mother and grandmother,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.200
he's beaten to death.
He's seven years old.

00:34:09.267 --> 00:34:11.200
William
Williams, a sailor,

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.467
assaulted by
the longshoremen,

00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:14.700
the dock workers, when
he asked for directions,

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:18.667
not knowing this riot is
happening. Someone picks

00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:23.900
up a cobblestone, hurls
the stone at him. Someone

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.400
else stabs him.
The crowd cheers,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.567
and they start
chanting--And I'm sorry to

00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:32.867
use the language but
you'll be hearing it

00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:34.100
several different
times in the course,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.500
but this is just the
history of it all--start

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.567
chanting, "Don't hire
niggers! Don't hire

00:34:38.567 --> 00:34:43.800
niggers!" Labor and
class all intertwined,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.300
certainly citizenship
as well. The Colored

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.167
Orphanage, a very large
building there to take

00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:52.500
care of
abandoned children,

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:58.500
the crowd sees this place
as a site of threat--I

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.500
guess you'd
say it's threat,

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.600
but something given to
blacks that the Irish

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.000
didn't have the benefit
of. And they decide

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.300
they're going to set
the orphanage on fire.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.100
Thankfully, word gets to
the orphanage in time,

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.400
and they were able to
escape out the back as the

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.167
building is torched. So
the Colored Orphanage is

00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:25.200
burned to the ground.
One story is particularly

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.267
illustrative, not a happy
story of course. On the

00:35:29.267 --> 00:35:32.467
third day of riots,
Abraham Franklin,

00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:37.600
a disabled black coachman,
and his sister Henrietta,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.400
were pulled out of
their boarding room. Now

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.600
there's one thing I
forgot to mention that's

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.800
important, thinking about
this particular setting.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.067
Blacks and Irish were sort
of--were at each others'

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:49.500
throats through
this process,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.300
but they're living in
the same areas. They're

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.400
interacting all the time,
and that's what makes this

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.800
story that much more
horrific in a sense. Many

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.000
Irish--I don't want to
paint entire groups--many

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.500
Irish and blacks got
along perfectly fine,

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.767
and certainly commingled
in every way that you can

00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:09.867
imagine that
word being used,

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.600
happily,
passionately, or angrily,

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.267
you name it. But they
were living in the--these

00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:16.400
were their own
neighborhoods. Abraham

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.600
Franklin and his sister
Henrietta are pulled out

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.200
of their boarding room.
Henrietta is beaten while

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.800
Abraham is
hanged. Federal troops,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800
who are now coming into
the city trying to quell

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800
the riot as it moves
to different places,

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.000
federal troops arrive, and
they cut down his body.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.700
It's too late to save his
life. Troops break up the

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.800
crowd and then disperse,
heading off to another

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.800
flashpoint. The rioting
crowd re-hangs the body,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.900
and they start chanting.
Just as you had William

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.900
Williams being murdered
to chants of "Don't hire

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.400
niggers,"
inflammatory declaration,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.600
in Abraham
Franklin's case,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.900
you have chants
coming out from the crowd,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.267
inflammatory in a
different way. They

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.800
re-hang his body to chants
of "Jeff Davis! Jeff

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.200
Davis" What does this
mean? They're praising

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.100
the president of
the Confederacy,

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:23.500
Jefferson Davis. So
you have Irish workers,

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.900
living with other African
Americans certainly,

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.900
feeling threatened that
their citizenship is at

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.400
stake, deciding to take
our their threat--and

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.800
feeling they might be
conscripted into the

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.500
military, likely would
be--they decide to take

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.200
out their anxiety, fears,
and anger on the Colored

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.600
Orphanage, on
seven year old boys,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:49.200
on sailors, on disabled
black coachmen. And

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.800
they're going to honor the
idea of keeping people out

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.700
of unions. "Don't hire
niggers." And they're

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.467
going to honor, curiously,
the presidency of the

00:37:58.467 --> 00:38:02.967
Confederacy--president
of the Confederacy. So

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:05.100
Abraham Franklin is
hung, body cut down. He's

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.900
re-hung--re-hanged, excuse
me--and then later on,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.000
after the crowd disperses
to do something else,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.200
somewhere else, a
sixteen-year old Irish

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.300
butcher cuts down
Franklin. Maybe his body

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.267
will finally be
put to rest. No,

00:38:26.267 --> 00:38:29.500
in fact the butcher
decides to drag his body

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.900
through the
streets as a trophy,

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.167
in so doing, I claim,
marking his own claim to

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:41.000
citizenship on the dead
body of a black--of a

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.300
crippled black man. Now
what's the point of all

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.100
this narrative? The point
of this is that we can see

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.500
in the crucible of the
Civil War a very clear

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.100
picture of what it means
to be a citizen and what

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.767
it means to be American.
A foundational question

00:38:57.767 --> 00:38:59.700
for this class, as I
mentioned in Monday's

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.500
lecture. Douglass
questioned the sanctity of

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.600
July Fourth, that
great cultural marker of

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.067
freedom. "Why would
you bring me here,

00:39:09.067 --> 00:39:13.200
representing a people
who only know slavery?"

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.900
Harper, the poet
and journalist,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.200
activist, makes clear how
blind people were to the

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.200
psychological
anguish of slavery,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.400
children being torn from
their mothers' breasts.

00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.900
The Dred Scott case is
explicitly about who could

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.400
be a citizen of the United
States. Taney didn't

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.200
think any slave could be
a citizen. They're too

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.800
inferior and they're
property. The political

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.300
turns made out
of necessity,

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300
and this is
very important,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.767
made out of necessity
in the Civil War,

00:39:47.767 --> 00:39:50.767
made it absolutely plain
to people like Abraham

00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:52.800
Lincoln, who starts to
decide to change these

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.300
policies; made it
absolutely plain that

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.067
citizenship was going
to be linked to freedom,

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:04.800
and that freedom was
linked to race. The

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.867
connection is certainly
there in terms of social,

00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:12.000
cultural forums.
It's there in political

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.567
forums. It is tangible.
As soon as he signs into

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:21.200
being the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.867
and in the fallout through
the Conscription Acts and

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:25.600
the New York
City draft riots,

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.600
it is real. Citizenship
is linked to freedom;

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.300
freedom is linked to
race. The tensions

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.067
between all of these
linkages are made really

00:40:39.067 --> 00:40:42.567
quite perfectly clear
by those people who are

00:40:42.567 --> 00:40:45.200
rioting in New
York City. And,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.200
I really think, made
abundantly clear when

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.700
Abraham Franklin was
dragged through the

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.200
streets of New York by his
genitals. Thank you very

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200
much. I'll see
you on Friday.

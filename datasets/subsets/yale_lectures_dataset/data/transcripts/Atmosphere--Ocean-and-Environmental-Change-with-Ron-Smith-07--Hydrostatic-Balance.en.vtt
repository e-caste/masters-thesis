00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.367
RONALD SMITH: So last time, we
derived a formula for the

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:39.133
equilibrium temperature
of a planet.

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.367
And I'm not going to go
back over that much.

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:45.733
The first column of information
here is a

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:46.833
continuation of that.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:54.367
But the way we did it was to
consider the Earth as a kind

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:59.200
of reservoir of heat that
can store heat.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.033
It can receive heat from
the Sun, and it can

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.767
radiate heat to space.

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:06.967
And then we tried to consider
how that system might come

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:08.533
into a steady-state balance.

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:14.300
So we were thinking of this very
much like the water tank.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.267
If I plotted temperature
versus time--

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:24.100
oh, I have to excuse myself for
the slow writing today.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.167
I think I've dislocated my
shoulder, so I'm going to be

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.933
doing it two-handed.

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:31.767
The lesson of the
day is wear your

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.900
helmet when you're biking.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.467
I did, so my head is OK,
but my shoulder's not.

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:43.433
So if I started the Earth at
some temperature but I was--

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:47.400
let's say I started it at zero
temperature, zero Kelvin.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400
This is unrealistic.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.033
It probably had some
temperature when

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:50.867
it was first formed.

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:53.400
But let's imagine I started
at zero Kelvin.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.833
Now, the Stefan-Boltzmann Law
says that an object at zero

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.200
temperature does not radiate.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.067
So the Earth would be receiving
heat from the Sun

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.300
but not radiating it.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.367
So the amount of heat stored
in the Earth would be

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:12.967
increasing.

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.967
That is to say, its temperature
would be

00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:20.533
increasing with time, getting
hotter and hotter each day

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:24.533
that went by, receiving more
heat from the Sun, not

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.000
radiating it to space.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.533
Well, of course, as soon as it
develops some temperature,

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.267
it's going to start
to radiate.

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.833
Remember, the Stefan-Boltzmann
Law says the power per unit

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.067
area is the sigma times
T to the fourth.

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:40.467
So as soon as T begins to rise,
you get a little bit of

00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:41.667
radiation to space.

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:46.133
So this curve will begin to
arc over a little bit, but

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:51.800
eventually, it'll reach a
constant temperature.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.733
And that'll be the case when the
rate of heat received from

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:59.867
the Sun equals the rate
at which energy is

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:01.667
radiating to space.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:02.833
That's the steady state.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:05.667
So we made the assumption that
we were in this state.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.733
We equated the incoming
radiation and the outgoing

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:13.033
radiation and found the
temperature that would allow

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:14.633
that balance to be reached.

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.667
Remember, if the temperature's
too cold, it won't radiate

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:23.867
enough to keep up with what
the Sun is delivering.

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:27.533
If the temperature is too hot,
it's radiating more than the

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:29.967
Sun is delivering, and the
temperature of the Earth would

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:31.500
cool with time.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.900
But in steady state, that
balance is reached.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.067
And what we did was solve for
that temperature, that single

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:40.967
temperature that would allow
the balance to be reached.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.800
And we derived this nice
little formula, and we

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.000
computed some values from it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.700
So we can summarize that
calculation by looking at this

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.400
little list of the things that
control Earth's temperature.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.700
The Sun diameter and the Sun's
temperature, because that

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.300
controls how much radiation
is emitted from the Sun.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.033
You can use the Stefan-Boltzmann
Law to figure

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:10.333
out how much each square meter
of the Sun is emitting and

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.533
then multiply times the surface
area of the Sun to get

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:17.533
the total amount of Sun's
radiant emission.

00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:20.400
It also depends on the Earth-Sun
distance, because as

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.867
that radiation moves out away
from the Sun, it diverges, it

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.467
spreads out.

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:27.333
And so the local intensity--

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:30.333
that is the watts per
square meter--

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:31.567
decreases.

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:34.267
So if you take a square meter
and put it right at the Sun's

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:37.267
surface, you'll get one value.

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:40.733
You take that same square meter
and move it further way,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:43.267
it'll have a lesser value,
because some of that radiation

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:47.967
has spread out and is missing
your little one square meter.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.567
So the Earth-Sun distance
is important.

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:55.400
These two things together gave
us the solar constant, the

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.667
thing we called capital S, which
you'll recall is about

00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:02.600
1,380 watts per square meter.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.967
It depends on the Sun diameter,
the Sun temperature,

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:07.033
and the Earth-Sun distance.

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.200
The albedo also came in.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.300
The albedo was the fraction of
the radiation that hits the

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.767
Earth that is reflected
back to space.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.033
Now, you know what are
the bright objects

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.267
and the dark objects.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.733
Clouds are very bright.

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:30.933
They reflect light
back to space.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.033
Snow fields are very bright.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.733
Bright desert sands and
even bright sand

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:42.400
beaches are very bright.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.100
They have a high albedo.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.067
Forests have a very
low albedo.

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:49.200
Ocean has a very low albedo.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.500
The value we used here-- we
used 33% for the Earth--

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.767
that's an average
of all of those.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:58.133
The bright objects, the dark
objects, sum them all up on

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:01.100
average, for Earth,
it's about 33%.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.500
For other planets,
it's different.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500
That was important.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.400
And from these considerations,
we came up with that formula

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.100
predicting the planet's
temperature, and we found that

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.267
it was a little bit low.

00:09:16.267 --> 00:09:19.033
And we argued that the reason
it was low is because we had

00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:21.067
neglected the greenhouse
effect.

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:24.033
We had assumed that the
long-wave radiation emitted

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:27.233
from the Earth's surface could
just escape to space.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:31.500
Whereas, in fact, the greenhouse
gases in our

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.900
atmosphere, especially water
vapor, CO2, N2O, NO, some

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.633
ozone as well, absorbed some
of that outgoing long-wave

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:46.333
radiation in the atmosphere,
heats up the atmosphere, and

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.867
some of it gets re-radiated
back to the

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:50.167
surface of the Earth.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:53.167
That's an extra warming,
if you like.

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:58.033
So our estimates for planetary
temperatures were universally

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:01.367
too cold, because we
had neglected that.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:06.767
Now, for Earth, it was a pretty
serious discrepancy.

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:09.800
You've got the values in your
notes, but I think it was

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.533
something like 30 degrees--

00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:17.600
we were 30 degrees too cold in
our simple estimates using

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.667
these items. And that makes a
difference between a habitable

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:26.267
planet and an uninhabitable
planet, at least for those

00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:28.600
living creatures that depend
on having water

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.867
in the liquid form.

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.267
So we've learned a lot of
lessons in last time's

00:10:36.267 --> 00:10:39.700
lecture, but one of them is
that, well, the greenhouse

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.333
effect is our friend.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:45.133
In other words, it makes
this planet habitable.

00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:47.500
Were it not for that, the
temperature would be

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.400
universally below the freezing
point for water, and we

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.167
wouldn't have the kind of life
that we have. Now, later in

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:55.667
the course when we're talking
about global warming, we'll

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:59.133
come back to this subject and
see maybe the greenhouse

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:02.500
effect is increasing, which
may not be a good thing.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.400
But on a broad-brush analysis,
looking at the habitability of

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.267
the planet, the greenhouse
effect is great.

00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:15.400
It warms us up to a place
where we can live.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.633
Any questions on that?

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.767
So that's in the
way of review.

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:25.033
Now, I want to go on and do
a different subject today.

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:28.067
You may have noticed, or maybe
you haven't, but I'm marching

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:31.867
through these first couple of
weeks of the course some of

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:36.467
the most fundamental ideas
in atmospheric science.

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:38.033
They're not in any
particular order.

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:41.300
I've tried to organize them a
bit so they make sense, but

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:47.000
they're kind of my picks for
the half-dozen or so most

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.033
important concepts in
atmospheric science.

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:53.400
And this basic heat budget
thing was one of them.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.700
We did that last time.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.000
Today I want to do another one
called hydrostatic balance.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.300
The basic idea behind
hydrostatic balance is that

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.433
air has weight.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.933
Air is heavy.

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:14.033
And the man who first made
this so obvious was the

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:19.867
Frenchman Pascal, who has the
pressure unit named after him.

00:12:19.867 --> 00:12:25.400
He took a mercury barometer like
the one that you had in

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.667
your lab the other day and
carried that from the base up

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:35.167
to the top of a mountain
in southern France.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.433
Puy-de-Dome is the name
of the mountain.

00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:38.100
I've been up there.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.767
I drove up there as a historical
gesture to Pascal.

00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:43.933
I wanted to see the place.

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:48.200
And he noted that the pressure
decreases as you go up.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.767
That was a great thing
to notice.

00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:51.367
But he also explained it.

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:56.900
He said, listen, the pressure
at each level pushing up has

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.967
to support the weight
of the air above it.

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:02.767
And so as you climb up
a mountain, you're

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:04.833
putting some air--

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:07.100
every time you step up, you're
putting some air below you.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.967
So the amount of air above you
decreases the higher you go,

00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:15.033
and therefore the pressure
will decrease as well.

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:18.067
Because the less air you have
above you, the less weight you

00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:21.067
have to support with that
pressure pushing up.

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.067
This was remarkable.

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:25.933
It seems so simple today,
but yet it really did

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:27.633
revolutionize the way
we thought about the

00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:29.100
atmosphere and so on.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.133
So here's the idea.

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:30.900
We're going to repeat his

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.300
calculation, hydrostatic
balance.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.667
"Static" here meaning there's
no acceleration--

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:40.433
it's just a static balance--

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:41.767
"hydro" referring to fluid.

00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:43.867
Now, we're talking about
air, but this applies

00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:46.367
to liquids as well.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:52.300
So here is a column of air
extending from sea level up

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.267
until we're outside
the atmosphere.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.433
So of course, the atmosphere
doesn't have a definite top,

00:13:57.433 --> 00:14:02.067
but we'll go up 10, 20 scale
heights, and so we're above

00:14:02.067 --> 00:14:04.400
virtually all the atmosphere.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.767
So there's no pressure pushing
down at the top of this,

00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:09.667
because there's no
air up there.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:13.233
But there is a pressure
pushing up.

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:16.933
It's the ground pushing up on
the air or the air pushing

00:14:16.933 --> 00:14:17.900
down on the ground,
either one.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.100
They have to be in balance.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.400
The pressure force pushing up on
this column of fluid is the

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.233
value of the pressure
times the base

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:30.033
area of that cylinder.

00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:33.567
Think of it as a cylinder
going up to space.

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:36.467
So P times A has
units of force.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:40.100
So remember, pressure is
a force per unit area.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.333
So when I multiply it times an
area, I'll get something with

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:48.700
units of force-- that is to say,
Newtons in the SI system.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:55.300
Now, this air column has a
certain amount of mass, and

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.600
I'll call that capital M. And
any time you've got mass and

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.467
you put it in the gravitational
field of a

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:04.067
planet, that object
will have weight.

00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:06.500
And you compute the weight by
multiplying the mass times the

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.233
acceleration of gravity.

00:15:09.233 --> 00:15:12.967
So now, here's where the word
"balance" comes in.

00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:16.267
I'm going to equate
those two things.

00:15:16.267 --> 00:15:19.967
I'm going to say that this is a
static system, so the weight

00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:24.067
of that air is held up by the
pressure force pushing up at

00:15:24.067 --> 00:15:25.067
the bottom of the column.

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:26.467
So there I've done it.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.533
The pressure times the area--

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:30.433
that's the vector up--

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:34.133
is equal to M times g--
that's the weight

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.867
vector pulling down.

00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:38.167
I've just rearranged that.

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:42.033
I've divided through by A and
divided through by g to get M

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:46.500
over A. That's the mass per
unit area is equal to the

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.867
surface pressure divided by the
acceleration of gravity.

00:15:49.867 --> 00:15:53.267
This is the fundamental form
in which we use it.

00:15:53.267 --> 00:15:58.300
This has units of kilograms
per square meter.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.233
And now leave an inch
in your notes and

00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:01.433
work out these units.

00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:04.133
This should have the
same units as that.

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:07.067
This one is obvious, kilograms
per square meter.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.533
This one's not so obvious.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:10.600
You're going to have to remember
what the units for

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.600
pressure are and for g and work
that out to see if the

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.567
units check on that.

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:20.767
So that's the basic assumption,
and that's the

00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:22.633
basic equation that
results from it.

00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:26.533
The mass per unit area in a
column reaching from sea level

00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:30.633
to outside the atmosphere is
just given by the pressure at

00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:33.100
sea level divided by the
acceleration of gravity.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.633
Now, we could do a quick
calculation of this.

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:44.067
For surface pressure, I would
put in about 1,000--

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:45.233
let's see--

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:55.833
101,300 Pascals, and I would
divide that by 9.81.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:58.000
Let's round that off to 10.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.100
So I'll just knock a decimal
place off here, and that'll be

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.267
one 3 with one 0.

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:06.333
That's going to be kilograms
per square meter.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.133
And that's about 10
metric tons, 10

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:18.433
tons per square meter.

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:21.033
In other words, if you walk
outside and imagine this

00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:25.467
one-square-meter base area and
that column going up, there's

00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:30.433
about 10 tons of air
in that column.

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:33.167
Any questions on that?

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:36.467
A pretty simple calculation.

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:37.000
And it works.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.567
It's very accurate, actually.

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:45.900
Now, that's a big step, and
it was pretty easy.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.767
I've got another big step
that's awful easy too.

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:53.533
Now that I know the amount of
mass per unit area, I can

00:17:53.533 --> 00:17:56.167
quickly compute the total amount
of mass in the Earth's

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.433
atmosphere.

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:02.067
I just have to know the
area of a sphere.

00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.967
We used that the other day
for another purpose.

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:07.433
That's 4 pi r squared.

00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:14.400
So if each square meter of
Earth's surface has this much

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.867
mass standing above it, then I
just multiply that by 4 pi r

00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:22.600
squared, which is the total
number of square meters on the

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.367
surface of the Earth, and I
get the atmospheric mass.

00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:29.433
So the atmospheric mass is given
by P over g, which is

00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:33.833
the same as M over A, times
4 pi r squared.

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:37.200
Now, this r is the radius
of the planet.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.900
So I've done the calculation
here again.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.633
I've put in 1,013, 9.81,
like I did there.

00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:46.533
4 pi.

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:49.000
There is the radius
of the planet.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.600
Now remember, I had to
get that in meters.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.200
Everything has to be in
consistent units.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.200
You square that out, and you
get 54 times 10 to the 17

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.200
kilograms. So just like that, we
got the mass of the Earth's

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.967
atmosphere.

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:07.200
Questions on that?

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:16.733
I'm going to extend that
calculation a little bit

00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:18.600
further now.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:27.233
If we've measured with some
device the mixing ratio of CO2

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.000
in the atmosphere--

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.633
how much CO2 is mixed in--

00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:35.033
we measure it locally and assume
that the ratio of CO2

00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:37.600
to air is the same everywhere.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.200
It's not a bad approximation.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.433
CO2 is pretty well mixed
in the atmosphere.

00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:45.700
It varies by a few percent, but
not much more than that,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.033
around the whole Earth's
atmosphere.

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:49.433
Then I could compute
the amount of

00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:54.867
mass of CO2, basically.

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:57.767
Remember, though, there's a
couple of ways to represent

00:19:57.767 --> 00:20:01.067
mixing ratio.

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:04.267
For example, you might see the
mixing ratio of CO2 in square

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:08.667
brackets sometimes written at
about 390 parts per million by

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.033
volume (390ppmv).

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:11.600
That's a molecular count.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.900
That's how many molecules of
CO2 per molecule of air.

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:22.033
Or you can forget the pp--
that's parts per million--

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:25.500
and write it 390 times 10 to
the minus six by volume.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.800
But you might want it by mass
instead, in which case you'd

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.033
have to multiply up front
by the ratio of

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:34.633
the molecular weights.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.700
CO2 is 44.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.167
Air is 29.

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:40.100
You put the same number
in there, you get 550.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.467
That's the concentration of
carbon dioxide by mass, parts

00:20:44.467 --> 00:20:46.467
per million by mass (ppmm).

00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:50.233
It ends with an m
instead of a v.

00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:55.100
Well then, if you want to know
the amount of carbon dioxide

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.200
in the atmosphere, you've got
the total amount here, just

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.800
multiply that number
times that number.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.767
Don't forget, there's a 10 the
minus six in this parts per

00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:07.300
million thing here.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.233
That's 10 to the minus six.

00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:13.100
And bingo, you've got the amount
of CO2 in the Earth's

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.200
atmosphere.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.567
So from a few simple ideas, our
quantitative understanding

00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:23.900
of the atmosphere is advancing
by leaps and bounds with these

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.133
simple calculations.

00:21:27.633 --> 00:21:28.033
Yes.

00:21:28.033 --> 00:21:28.833
STUDENT: I'm sorry.

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:29.233
What was the 29, again?

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:30.933
PROFESSOR: The 29 is the

00:21:30.933 --> 00:21:33.767
molecular weight of air.

00:21:33.767 --> 00:21:36.633
You'll recall that the molecular
weight of nitrogen

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:43.700
is 28, and the molecular
weight of oxygen is 32.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.467
There's more nitrogen than
oxygen, so the average is a

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:50.967
little closer to
28 than to 32.

00:21:50.967 --> 00:21:54.967
It comes out to be almost
exactly 29 for the average

00:21:54.967 --> 00:22:00.767
molecular weight of air, being
a mixture of N2 and O2.

00:22:00.767 --> 00:22:02.600
That's how that number
comes from.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.867
Good question.

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:05.133
Other questions or comments?

00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:11.000
Now, there's another form of
the hydrostatic relation.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.867
This is for the total column.

00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:18.267
There's another form which
involves just looking at a

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:20.167
little segment of
the atmosphere.

00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:22.633
So imagine a little cylinder.

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.367
You might want to still consider
it a cylinder,

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:27.600
perhaps, but you slice it here,
and you slice it there,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.133
and you just consider this
little stub of an atmosphere.

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:33.100
And you want to know how the
pressure is different at the

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.433
bottom than the top.

00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:41.033
And while I do this derivation,
I have a volunteer

00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:43.800
who is going to take the Kestrel
that you're familiar

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:51.033
with and run up to the top of
KBT and measure the pressure

00:22:51.033 --> 00:22:54.800
at the ground floor
and the top floor.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.367
And when she comes back in
class, we will have finished a

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:02.733
prediction of what she will
measure for that pressure

00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:05.000
difference, based on
the derivation

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.633
I'm about to do here.

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:07.867
Thanks very much.

00:23:11.067 --> 00:23:15.433
Now, in many ways-- in some
ways, the calculation is

00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:16.267
similar to this one.

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:19.067
But instead of looking at the
whole atmospheric column,

00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:22.800
we're just going to consider
this little stub of a column.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.400
So there's a pressure at the
bottom, which I'll call P sub

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.167
B. That's the pressure
at the bottom

00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:30.833
of that little cylinder.

00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:36.000
The pressure at the top is P sub
T. The horizontal area of

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.200
that little chunk is capital
A. Its height is delta z.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.400
In other words, that's the
difference between the

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.333
altitude at the bottom and
the altitude at the top.

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:50.133
I usually use z in this
course for altitude.

00:23:50.133 --> 00:23:50.900
STUDENT: What is A?

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.567
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:23:51.567 --> 00:23:52.200
STUDENT: What is A?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.567
PROFESSOR: A is the
top area of the cylinder.

00:23:57.567 --> 00:24:01.200
So now there are three forces
acting on this thing.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.067
There's a pressure at the
bottom acting on area A

00:24:06.067 --> 00:24:07.967
pushing up, and that's
the little vector

00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:09.233
I've drawn in there.

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:17.600
There's a pressure at the top
acting over the same area A,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.100
so it's P Top times A. That's
the vector pointing down.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.000
And there's another down vector,
and that's the weight

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.100
of the mass in that chunk.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.000
And if you want to know the mass
of a fluid, you multiply

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.400
the density, if you have
it, times the volume.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.500
So I've written it here as Greek
letter rho for density,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.400
and then the volume is the
product of the area and the

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.233
height of the cylinder.

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:50.967
Do you remember that
from trigonometry?

00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.100
The volume of the cylinder
is just the area times

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.367
the height of it.

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:57.267
So that's the volume.

00:24:57.267 --> 00:25:01.167
So those three things together--
rho, A, delta z--

00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:04.267
that's the mass of the air.

00:25:04.267 --> 00:25:09.433
It has units of kilograms,
like the M over here.

00:25:09.433 --> 00:25:12.733
And then I multiply it times
g to get the weight.

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:19.200
Now, I want to simplify that
formula a little bit.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.033
Notice A appears in each of the
three terms. So I cancel

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:29.933
that out, I bring the PT over,
and I keep the rho g delta z

00:25:29.933 --> 00:25:30.767
on the right-hand side.

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:37.500
And this is the formula that
I've then derived for the

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.533
hydrostatic law extending over
some small range of altitudes.

00:25:43.533 --> 00:25:47.233
It says that the pressure at the
bottom is greater than the

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:51.233
pressure at the top by an amount
given by the product of

00:25:51.233 --> 00:25:55.000
the air density, the
acceleration of gravity, and

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.867
the height of the object, the
height of the air chunk, the

00:25:57.867 --> 00:25:59.100
air parcel.

00:26:01.967 --> 00:26:03.200
Questions on that?

00:26:05.967 --> 00:26:08.767
Let's do a calculation then.

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.533
She's gone up to Kline
Biology Tower.

00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:14.000
She'll take a measurement here,
take the elevator up to

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.633
the 12th floor, take a
measurement there, and then

00:26:15.633 --> 00:26:16.367
come back to class.

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:19.567
So we've got to hurry up
and get a prediction

00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:20.300
of what that is.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.733
So we're interested in the
difference between P at the

00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:28.133
bottom and P at the top.

00:26:28.133 --> 00:26:31.233
So here's what we need to do.

00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:35.767
We're going to use the standard
value for air density

00:26:35.767 --> 00:26:37.067
at sea level.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:40.067
It varies a little bit, but
for most purposes we can

00:26:40.067 --> 00:26:45.500
assume that it's 1.2 kilograms
per cubic meter.

00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:53.867
g is 9.81.

00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:57.967
Units on that are meters
per second squared.

00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:03.433
And we have to get the
height, the delta z.

00:27:03.433 --> 00:27:07.867
Now, this is 12 floors, and
I'm assuming that there's

00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:12.767
about four meters from
floor to floor.

00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:17.067
For example, here, I think
that's about nine or 10 feet,

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:18.333
which is about three meters.

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:21.067
But then there's a certain
thickness before you get up to

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:23.100
the next floor.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.567
So this is a pretty
crude estimate.

00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.867
I've never measured it, but
I'm going to assume that

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:33.767
there's four meters per floor,
so that's 48 meters for the

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:35.000
height of Kline Biology Tower.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.667
We could measure this, and I
probably would find that I

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:38.567
have some error here.

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:43.733
But to a rough approximation,
that's going to be 48 meters.

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:46.933
Now, check the units on this,
because when I multiply these

00:27:46.933 --> 00:27:48.267
things together, I've
got to get something

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:51.467
with units of Pascals.

00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:55.067
And let me see what I come
up with when I do that

00:27:55.067 --> 00:27:56.300
calculation.

00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:08.000
Yes, this gives me 565.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.167
If anyone has a calculator,
please check me on this,

00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:13.133
because I'm not sure I can read
my own handwriting here.

00:28:13.133 --> 00:28:18.767
565 Pascals.

00:28:18.767 --> 00:28:20.100
Would someone check me on
that, please, with a

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.600
calculator?

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.767
1.2 times 9.81 times 48.

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:29.267
Is that about right?

00:28:29.267 --> 00:28:30.000
It's 565?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.600
OK.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:39.267
Now, the instrument she's
reading, the Kestrel reads out

00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:44.267
in hectoPascals, which is
a hundredth of a Pascal.

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.067
So we are predicting that
she will find a pressure

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:54.800
difference of 5.65 hectoPascals,
which is also

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.967
millibars, by the way.

00:28:57.967 --> 00:29:00.467
And so we'll see when
she comes back.

00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:07.767
Now, this is a pretty useful
idea, and you've used it

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:08.967
already in your lab.

00:29:08.967 --> 00:29:12.233
For example, when you were
using the-- a question.

00:29:12.233 --> 00:29:12.700
Yes.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.667
STUDENT: Sorry.

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:18.000
Is a hectoPascal 100 Pascals or
one hundredth of a Pascal?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.733
PROFESSOR: A hectoPascal is

00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:22.367
100 Pascals, yes.

00:29:22.367 --> 00:29:27.900
So 565 Pascal is 5.65
hectoPascals.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.900
I get that switched
all the time.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.733
We've used the hydrostatic law
in your lab a couple of times.

00:29:33.733 --> 00:29:38.100
For example, when you're using
the mercury barometer, you are

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.167
assuming that hydrostatic
balance held within the

00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:43.200
mercury fluid.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.900
The atmospheric pressure
was pushing down on

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.333
the top of the reservoir.

00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:49.667
There's a vacuum above, so
there's nothing pushing down

00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:50.767
on the mercury.

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:55.133
But the weight of that mercury
column is balanced by

00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:57.867
atmospheric pressure pushing
on the reservoir.

00:29:57.867 --> 00:29:58.800
Let me just sketch that out.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:06.367
I know you did this in class
also, but the mercury lies in

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:09.733
here and up to there.

00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:14.967
So atmospheric pressure acting
down here supports that column

00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:15.467
of mercury.

00:30:15.467 --> 00:30:19.733
And this calculation would
work perfectly for that.

00:30:19.733 --> 00:30:22.133
Just remember, there's a vacuum
up here, so there's no

00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:25.867
pressure pushing down, but the
pressure pushing up is exactly

00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:30.533
balancing the weight of the
column of mercury standing

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:33.567
above the base level.

00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:37.300
I believe you also used it when
you were correcting your

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.100
pressure measurement to
go down to sea level.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.833
You measured the pressure here
in the laboratory, but that's

00:30:45.833 --> 00:30:49.533
a few meters above sea level,
and so you needed to compute a

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:54.867
correction to add to that to get
the pressure at sea level.

00:30:54.867 --> 00:30:59.600
Are there any questions about
the hydrostatic law before I

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.433
change gears?

00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:02.200
I'm waiting for her to come
back, but I've got a few more

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.900
things I want to
say about this.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.967
But I'd prefer to take
your questions now.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.167
Here we go.

00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:16.933
Could you just call out the
pressures for this?

00:31:16.933 --> 00:31:21.700
STUDENT: For the ground
level, it was 1,007.9.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.467
PROFESSOR: 1,007.9.

00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:30.667
STUDENT: And then the 12th
floor was 1,002.2.

00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:37.300
PROFESSOR: 1,002.2.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.967
So that difference is 5.7.

00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:44.900
Wow.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.100
Did we do good?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.233
Look at that.

00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:49.233
5.65, 5.7.

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:50.000
We did good on that.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.067
It doesn't usually come out
that well, actually.

00:31:52.067 --> 00:31:52.900
Congratulations.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.233
You're good.

00:31:54.233 --> 00:31:55.333
You're good.

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:58.133
You jiggied those numbers
just right, so we

00:31:58.133 --> 00:31:59.167
got the right answer.

00:31:59.167 --> 00:31:59.900
You get the point.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.067
Now, you didn't scale up the
outside of the building.

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:05.933
You went in and took the
elevator up, I presume, right?

00:32:05.933 --> 00:32:06.467
STUDENT: Yes.

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:10.333
PROFESSOR: So the
question is how was she able

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:14.567
to get good numbers like this
inside the building?

00:32:14.567 --> 00:32:16.467
Isn't the inside of the building
different than

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:21.367
outside, where things are free
to the rest of the atmosphere?

00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:26.067
Not really, because buildings
leak around the windows and

00:32:26.067 --> 00:32:26.433
everywhere.

00:32:26.433 --> 00:32:32.367
So when you walk into a
building, the pressure changes

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:33.433
very, very little.

00:32:33.433 --> 00:32:37.567
The outside pressure, inside
pressure is about the same,

00:32:37.567 --> 00:32:40.267
with a couple of exceptions.

00:32:40.267 --> 00:32:44.133
If you play tennis at one of
these inflatable tennis

00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:45.833
courts-- you know what I'm
talking about, they blow these

00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:47.000
things up?--

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.367
you walk into that building,
you have to

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:50.833
kind of pull the door--

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:53.533
high pressure inside, so
you kind of have to

00:32:53.533 --> 00:32:54.867
push to get in there.

00:32:54.867 --> 00:32:59.700
If you feel when you're entering
that building a

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.500
pressure resistance when you
go through the doors--

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.567
and most buildings
don't have that--

00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:06.967
but if you feel it, there's
some kind of active air

00:33:06.967 --> 00:33:09.400
conditioning that's keeping the
pressure inside higher or

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.533
lower than outside.

00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:14.433
And you might want to worry
then about whether your

00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:16.300
measurements are the same
inside and outside.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.800
But for the most part, you can
measure the pressure inside a

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.533
building, and it's the same
as it is outside.

00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.633
So in the laboratory, when I had
you measure the pressure

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:28.500
using the mercury barometer in
Room 120, that's the same as

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.000
the atmospheric pressure
outside.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.433
There's no pressure differential
in that building.

00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:34.933
You couldn't do that
with temperature.

00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.867
Temperature's different inside,
humidity's different

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:40.167
inside, but the pressure
likes to equalize.

00:33:40.167 --> 00:33:45.733
And so this is a very robust
calculation, as the agreement

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.167
shows there.

00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:51.267
Other questions about
hydrostatic?

00:33:51.267 --> 00:33:54.433
Let's spend a few
minutes on this.

00:33:54.433 --> 00:33:55.300
Questions on hydrostatic law?

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:55.733
Yeah.

00:33:55.733 --> 00:33:57.933
STUDENT: Where do
you get the 1.2?

00:33:57.933 --> 00:33:59.700
PROFESSOR: That is a standard

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.967
value, sea-level density.

00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:07.000
You can compute it from the
perfect gas law if you know

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.867
the pressure and the
temperature.

00:34:08.867 --> 00:34:10.133
I think we did that.

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:13.833
If you measure the temperature
in this room and the pressure

00:34:13.833 --> 00:34:15.967
in this room, you can use
the perfect gas law

00:34:15.967 --> 00:34:16.933
to solve for that.

00:34:16.933 --> 00:34:19.333
And I think we did
that earlier.

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:21.067
Now, as you go up in the
atmosphere, of course, that

00:34:21.067 --> 00:34:22.800
value changes.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:29.333
By the way, this simple formula
has a value for

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:32.400
density in it.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.967
That means you couldn't use it
to predict pressure difference

00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:38.467
over a very great height
difference, because the

00:34:38.467 --> 00:34:41.900
density changes over a great
height difference.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.733
And so you wouldn't know what
value to put in for rho.

00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:51.800
So this formula is best used
over distances of a couple of

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.700
hundred meters or less.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.233
If you're going to compute
pressure difference over a

00:34:59.233 --> 00:35:03.267
much greater distance, I would
use that exponential formula

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:05.600
that we had in class
a week ago.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.367
So this is for short distances
delta z, because it's assumed

00:35:11.367 --> 00:35:14.867
a constant value for density.

00:35:14.867 --> 00:35:20.267
Now, by the way, this same law
operates in the oceans.

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:24.200
As you go down in the oceans,
the pressure increases at a

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.133
rate given quite precisely
by the hydrostatic law.

00:35:28.133 --> 00:35:31.700
It's accurate to within at
least one part in 1,000,

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.067
probably one part in 10,000,
so a very accurate

00:35:34.067 --> 00:35:35.567
calculation.

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:38.033
And for that, it's a bit easier,
because the density of

00:35:38.033 --> 00:35:40.733
water doesn't change very much
as you go down in the ocean.

00:35:40.733 --> 00:35:44.333
Water is nearly an
incompressible liquid.

00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:46.933
It doesn't change its volume
when you put it

00:35:46.933 --> 00:35:49.500
under a high pressure.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.000
But remember, the density for
water is much, much greater

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.133
than that for air.

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:55.267
What is the density of water?

00:35:55.267 --> 00:35:56.333
Anybody know?

00:35:56.333 --> 00:35:57.767
I bet you know from
your problem set.

00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:01.067
One--

00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:03.067
STUDENT: 1,000 kilograms--

00:36:03.067 --> 00:36:07.633
PROFESSOR: 1,000
kilograms per cubic meter,

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:09.667
about 1,000 times that value.

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:14.667
So water is about 1,000
times denser than air.

00:36:14.667 --> 00:36:17.333
So I've been trying to impress
on you today that air has

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:20.500
mass, but of course, water
has much more mass.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.733
Water is much denser
liquid than air is.

00:36:25.733 --> 00:36:28.767
Other comments or questions
about the hydrostatic law?

00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:32.100
Yes.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.800
STUDENT: I understand the
practical applications of this

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.700
for the ocean, but what are
some ways this is used in

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.967
meteorology?

00:36:47.533 --> 00:36:51.567
PROFESSOR: Let me
give you an example of that.

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:54.167
Notice that the rate at which
the pressure increases as you

00:36:54.167 --> 00:36:58.233
go down depends on the
density of the air.

00:36:58.233 --> 00:37:03.667
So let's say in the center
of a hurricane, you had

00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:04.900
a lot of warm air.

00:37:07.467 --> 00:37:12.767
If you look at the perfect gas
law, you can find that warm

00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:16.167
air at the same pressure
is less dense.

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:22.600
So you have a value of rho here
that is relatively small

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.900
compared to the rho out
here, which is larger.

00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:32.600
Small rho in the center of the
hurricane, large rho outside

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.100
the hurricane.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.500
Now, let's say you've got the
same pressure everywhere here,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.567
but as you come down in the
atmosphere here, through the

00:37:39.567 --> 00:37:42.200
low-density region, pressure
increases.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.600
But it increases slowly,
because rho is smaller.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.900
Here, pressure increases, but
it increases more rapidly,

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.033
because rho is larger.

00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:53.567
Remember, the story here in this
box is that the pressure

00:37:53.567 --> 00:37:59.233
increases as you go down at a
rate given by the air density.

00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:03.300
So if the pressure is the same
at all locations up here, by

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.533
the time I work my way down
under here, I'm going to have

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:10.100
low pressure and relatively
higher

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.000
pressure outside the hurricane.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.067
So this hydrostatic law is the
reason why there is low

00:38:18.067 --> 00:38:19.900
pressure in the center
of a hurricane.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.533
We'll talk about this later
on in the course.

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:22.500
We'll talk about hurricanes.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.767
But we see it now, this basic
law is responsible for this

00:38:26.767 --> 00:38:30.533
very important property of
hurricanes having low pressure

00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:32.533
in the center.

00:38:32.533 --> 00:38:36.333
Because there's warm air aloft,
and the warm air is

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:38.767
less dense, has a smaller
value of density.

00:38:38.767 --> 00:38:41.733
Then just use that formula, and
you'll get that very nice

00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:44.600
and very practical, very
important result.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.233
In fact, we typically-- very
often, we measure the strength

00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:52.967
of a hurricane by how low that
pressure reaches in the center

00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:53.900
of the hurricane.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.600
What you're really measuring
when you do that is the amount

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.867
of warm air aloft.

00:38:59.867 --> 00:39:02.567
And that's a good thing, because
that's an important

00:39:02.567 --> 00:39:05.700
aspect of the structure
of a hurricane.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.767
So there's a good example
for that question.

00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:10.067
Other issues, other questions?

00:39:14.433 --> 00:39:15.733
Let's quit a bit early today.

00:39:15.733 --> 00:39:18.167
I'll see you on Friday.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.002
Prof: So,
what I want to do today is

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.029
resist the temptation to talk
about anarchism the entire time.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.131
I sent around the terms for
today of which I only forgot one

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:13.910
or two.
 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.297
What I think I'll do at the
beginning is I'm going to talk

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:20.886
very quickly about socialism,
and the difference between

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.870
revolutionary socialism and
reform socialism.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.555
Add syndicalism to the mix,
and these are all terms that I

00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:29.193
sent to you, so I'm not going to
write them on the board,

00:00:29.193 --> 00:00:30.560
because I need the board.
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.656
Then for most of the lecture
I'm going to talk about

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:33.150
anarchism.
 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.850
Anarchists didn't want to
reform the state.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.598
They didn't want to seize
control of the state either by

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:43.120
revolution or by electoral
process.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.110
They wanted to destroy the
state.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.870
So, I'm going to talk about
those guys for a while.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.020
Most anarchists were not
terrorists,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.902
but at the end I'm going to
talk about a guy that I followed

00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:59.390
around for four or five years
who was a terrorist,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.409
and arguably--it's a book I
just finished--one can find the

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.650
origins of modern terrorism in
this guy,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.879
who is called Émile
Henry.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.000
This will fit into Paris.
 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.659
It's obviously sort of a
sub-theme in this course,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.670
and so is the state and
capitalism.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.962
This particular person,
Émile Henry,

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:23.030
set out to bomb and to kill.
 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.299
His targets changed the name of
the game for terrorists.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.739
That's obviously what I can't
wait to talk about.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:35.709
But first I'm going to just
review briefly for you,

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.170
it's getting briefer every
second that I think about this,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.580
the socialist stuff,
which you can read about.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.536
With the rise of mass politics
in Europe in the 1880s and

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:56.040
1890s, there was the rise of
mass socialist parties.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.974
Basically just to review:
there are two kinds of

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:00.980
socialism.
 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.650
There were the revolutionary
socialists,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.597
of which Marx was an obvious
example and his son-in-law Paul

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.903
Lafargue,
a name you don't have to

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.514
retain,
who brought Marxist theory to

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:18.544
France,
who believed that revolution

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:23.693
would come when the proletariat
was class-conscious and after a

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:27.555
bourgeois revolution,
of which he basically thought

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:30.508
1848 had been a good example
following in 1789.

00:02:30.508 --> 00:02:35.478
And the proletariat would rise
up and break their chains and

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:37.919
bring this brave new world.
 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.742
And, so, there were
revolutionary socialists in

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:44.235
Italy, in Spain,
and in France,

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:46.729
and even a few in Germany.
 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:52.471
Reform socialists said,
"Look, states are becoming

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:58.000
stronger and stronger,
and can break revolutions very

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.169
easily.
 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.221
Look what happened to the Paris
Commune of 1871 when about

00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.780
25,000 people are massacred,
men,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.908
women and children are gunned
down,

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:13.028
and that the way to bringing
social reform and abolishing the

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:17.038
abuses of capitalism is through
reform."

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:21.000
This is the reformist tradition
in Germany.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.107
It's identified with somebody
who's in the book,

00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:25.430
Edouard Bernstein.
 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.810
And you can see this in the
growth of the SPD,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.878
the German Socialist Reformist
Party,

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:39.422
which was the largest party in
the Reichstag in 1914 when war

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:40.840
breaks out.
 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.169
What you do is if you organize,
you can--legislatures,

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.119
if you have enough socialists
and enough well-meaning other

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.940
people in the legislatures,
in the Reichstag,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.400
or in the Chambre des
Députés,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.229
or the other parliaments in
places that had parliaments,

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.080
then you can vote in laws.
 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.540
You can vote in mine safety
regulations, because mining

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.348
accidents killed so many people.
 

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.907
There's one in the Pas de
Calais where hundreds and

00:04:10.907 --> 00:04:13.465
hundreds of people,
a thousand people get killed in

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:15.460
one accident in about 1910 or
1911.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.579
You can pass an eight-hour day
or a ten-hour day.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.879
You can pass laws making it
harder and harder to employ

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.569
children, particularly in
dangerous tasks.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.259
You can do things for women.
 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.790
You could do things for
families.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.471
If you elect the right kind of
people, you can have a

00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:38.870
revolution through reform,
through the ballot.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.709
And the great socialist leaders
such as Bernstein,

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:43.836
whom I just mentioned,
or the great Jean

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:47.564
Jaurès,
whose death on the 31^(st) of

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:53.589
July in 1914 was really the end
of an era and the beginning of

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.966
another era,
a scary era of the war--people

00:04:57.966 --> 00:04:59.459
had that sense.
 

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:04.762
He was the one who in France
unified the reform socialists

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:09.321
and the revolutionary
socialists, though there are

00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:12.949
still fissures in their
approaches.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.732
Of course, the old
revolutionary socialists would

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.819
become the Communists after
1920,

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.524
when the French Communist Party
is begun in the wake of the

00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:23.730
Russian Revolution,
which seemed to be,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.550
even though it was a revolution
in a very complex situation,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.230
that seemed to say that you can
have a revolution.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.110
But anyway, reform socialists
dominate in Germany.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.779
They dominate in France.
 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:38.920
They dominate in Belgium.
 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.970
The Socialist Party is terribly
important in Italy;

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.569
they become more important in
Spain as well.

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.800
Those are the two big
traditions.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.166
Some of the tensions between
revolutionary socialists and

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:55.714
reform socialists can be seen in
the fact that revolutionary

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:57.699
socialists said,
"Look,

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.685
if you are working in the
Reichstag and you're trying to

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:05.307
get better insurance
plans," ironically it was

00:06:05.307 --> 00:06:09.437
Bismarck's Germany that gives
really the first substantial

00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:13.341
insurance program for workers,
"what you're doing is

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.220
you're propping up the bourgeois
state.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.459
You're buying into it.
 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.362
You're supporting indirectly
their armies that crush workers

00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:23.536
and strikes,"
and they did in the heroic age

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:25.718
of syndicalism,
but more about that in a

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:29.339
minute,
1895 to about 1907 in France.

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:30.980
But in other countries it's
about the same thing.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.779
"You're propping up the
bourgeois state by participating

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.680
in electoral politics."
 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.870
But lots of revolutionary
socialists,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.300
and this is all in the book so
don't worry about this,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.160
but a lot of them say,
"Look,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.930
if we don't run candidates and
elections,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.569
how are they going to know
about us?"

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.894
So, they, too,
would run candidates and

00:06:48.894 --> 00:06:49.629
elections.
 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.639
So, they're put at really kind
of coincé.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.151
They're really sort of stuck
between a rock and a hard place,

00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:56.454
because they're running
candidates in elections in which

00:06:56.454 --> 00:06:57.459
they do not believe.
 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.389
I'm not here talking about
Russia,

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.230
because that is more
complicated with the Bolsheviks,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.918
and the Mensheviks,
and the socialist

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:08.100
revolutionaries,
and we will come back to them.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.970
I'm talking basically about
Western Europe.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.369
You have to imagine that Lenin
and the other Russian socialists

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:20.767
are sort of walking around the
lakes of Geneva and of Zurich in

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:23.889
exile and trying to imagine this
future.

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.153
But that's the big difference
between socialists,

00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:28.990
reform and revolutionary.
 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.394
Now, to make things even more
complicated, you have a group

00:07:32.394 --> 00:07:33.920
called the syndicalists.
 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.002
The word
"syndicalist"

00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:39.968
is an English word which I sent
along on your friendly email

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:41.379
from yours truly.
 

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.339
Syndicalist,
the word comes from the French

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.579
word for unions,
which is a syndicat.

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:50.350
What they said is,
"Hang on."

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.675
They kind of believed with the
revolutionary socialists,

00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:54.452
saying,
"If you get involved in

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.639
electoral process,
you are propping up this

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.910
corrupt bourgeois state.
 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.673
You are propping up this
dynamic duo of the state and

00:08:01.673 --> 00:08:03.050
capitalism."
 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.629
Syndicalists say,
"Look, we will organize

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:10.367
from the ground up,
beginning in the shop floor,

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:11.639
the factory.
 

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.860
That will be not only a means
to obtain a revolution,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.773
it's a way of seeing what the
future world will be like when

00:08:19.773 --> 00:08:22.625
everybody tutoies
everybody or Dus

00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:23.819
everybody.
 

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:28.654
The kind of relations,
the friendly equal relations of

00:08:28.654 --> 00:08:32.240
the shop floor become,
after the revolution,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.850
the way the world will be
organized."

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.634
In the South of Europe,
in Italy and in Spain,

00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:40.913
these folks are called,
and I sent this around to you,

00:08:40.913 --> 00:08:42.460
anarcho-syndicalists.
 

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.080
You see a transition here.
 

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.850
Anarcho-syndicalists.
 

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.429
Because they're rejecting the
state and they're looking in the

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:54.558
future, the decentralized
organization is part of it.

00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:59.600
Anarcho-syndicalists have
considerable influence in Spain

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.678
and Italy.
 

00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:03.576
They believe in direct action,
and sabotage,

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.340
and strikes,
but in union organization.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.177
One of the most interesting--I
mention him in the book--Fernand

00:09:11.177 --> 00:09:12.269
Pelloutier,
 

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:20.090
who wrote a book called The
Dying Society,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.179
was one of the theoreticians of
anarcho-syndicalism,

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:24.409
of syndicalism.
 

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:26.139
He was dying.
 

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:27.940
He was dying of TB.
 

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.307
Though he was not a worker,
tuberculosis was a

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:31.570
working-class disease.
 

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.820
Go to Pennsylvania.
 

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.308
Go to West Virginia.
 

00:09:34.308 --> 00:09:36.772
Tuberculosis,
the ravages of the mines in the

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:38.899
United States,
were just incredible.

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:42.585
In porcelain factories and all
sorts of places,

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:45.548
glass factories all over the
place.

00:09:45.548 --> 00:09:48.840
Pelloutier creates these things
called labor exchanges.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.404
He's one of the people who come
to these things called labor

00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:55.269
exchanges,
bourse de travail,

00:09:55.269 --> 00:10:00.032
you call them in French,
which were towns where you had

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:04.556
municipal socialists in power at
the municipal level--and you

00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:06.330
did,
in some cities,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.869
are giving municipal funds to
start these labor exchanges

00:10:09.869 --> 00:10:11.259
which are buildings.
 

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.649
You can still see them.
 

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.865
When I was invited to Limoges
to give a big talk by the

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.485
Conféderation
Général du

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:19.995
Travail,
we started the

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.528
apéro,
the first round of drinks,

00:10:22.528 --> 00:10:24.779
about noon in the labor
exchange,

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:27.259
in the maison du peuple,
the house of the people.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:30.201
They were places where workers
coming from other places could

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:32.113
come and get a meal,
get some money and,

00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:33.830
above all, find out about jobs.
 

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.230
So, syndicalists--the way they
imagine the future,

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.250
and preparing for this brave
new world of post-revolutionary

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.683
relationships,
that has an important

00:10:43.683 --> 00:10:46.658
privileged place in the way they
view the world.

00:10:46.658 --> 00:10:49.799
There was an engineer called
Georges Sorel,

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:53.538
whose name I should have send
around, S-O-R-E-L.

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:57.610
He comes to the notion of the
general strike.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.177
One day all workers will simply
put down their tools and say,

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.200
"Hell with you,
capitalism.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.399
Hell with you, the State.
 

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:08.639
And they will bring capitalism
to its knees."

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:11.450
It doesn't really ever work out
that way, does it?

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.110
The capitalists and the State
win the day.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.410
So, having rushed through all
of that, let me talk about what

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.058
I want to talk about.
 

00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:23.812
That is anarchism,
of which there is only a couple

00:11:23.812 --> 00:11:26.845
short, and I hope sprightly,
paragraphs in which you're

00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:27.519
reading.
 

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.370
I am not an anarchist.
 

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.658
Sometimes when I give talks at
various places--I was at St.

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:36.110
Louis recently,
and other places,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.769
people at the end will
think--hopefully,

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:38.840
they'll never think I'm a
terrorist,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.898
because I'm certainly not,
and when I talk about this guy

00:11:41.898 --> 00:11:44.668
I do not do so with affection or
admiration.

00:11:44.668 --> 00:11:46.860
But I know him because I
followed him around.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.769
I followed him around.
 

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:53.830
Most anarchists were not
terrorists.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.990
One wants to make that clear.
 

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:01.551
It's not surprising that the
great strengths of anarchism are

00:12:01.551 --> 00:12:07.019
in Spain in Catalonia and in
Andalusia in the south of Spain

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:09.429
and in southern Italy.
 

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:10.830
Why?
 

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.332
Because that's where the
Italian and the Spanish states

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:18.096
have very limited success in
convincing people that they're

00:12:18.096 --> 00:12:19.590
Spanish or Italian.
 

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.830
Why should they believe they're
Spanish or Italian?

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.879
Southern Italians thought that
the republic was a monarchy.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:29.206
But the progressive monarchy,
so called, was a plot launched

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:32.534
by tax collectors and industrial
capitalists in the North of

00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:33.100
Italy.
 

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.500
In Andalusia and in Catalonia
were the Civil Guard,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.399
who tended to be from Galicia,
a conservative part of Spain

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:46.149
where the odious Franco was from
or from Castile,

00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:49.658
a huge area around Madrid.
 

00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:52.265
It was easy to see how they
associated the state with

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.970
something that they didn't want.
 

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.452
In writing about anarchism,
I tried to put myself and tried

00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:02.009
to think of how anarchists
viewed the world.

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:05.149
I want to tell you a story
that's a true story.

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:10.009
If you're trying to imagine how
anarchists viewed the world,

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:12.480
this story is not a bad one.
 

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.861
It's about a cork worker making
corks for bottles of sherry in

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:21.059
the south of Spain.
 

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:23.070
He's dying.
 

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.519
He'd been an anarchist his
entire life.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.500
He hated the state.
 

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.289
He hated capitalism.
 

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:32.139
He hated the church.
 

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:34.600
He's dying.
 

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.320
He's on his deathbed.
 

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.815
He had married a woman from a
religiously practicing Catholic

00:13:41.815 --> 00:13:42.639
family.
 

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:48.450
In the scene in this room in
which he's dying,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.740
in one part of the room is his
family,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.812
who hated organized religion,
who view it as a prop for

00:13:55.812 --> 00:13:57.690
capitalism and the state.
 

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.049
On the other side of the room
are people who are not so sure.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.230
They went to church sometimes.
 

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.500
They knew the priest.
 

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.538
When he's lying there,
the end is near.

00:14:09.538 --> 00:14:13.370
His wife's family says,
"Pedro,

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.860
don't you want me to bring a
lawyer in?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.129
A lawyer who will take your
last will."

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.581
Anarchists don't have wills and
they don't have very much

00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:27.259
property.
 

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:30.726
The other side of the room is
just utter terror,

00:14:30.726 --> 00:14:31.389
horror.
 

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:34.764
How can they suggest such a
thing, that Pedro is going to

00:14:34.764 --> 00:14:35.610
make a will?
 

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.048
That's a bourgeois thing to do,
to make a will.

00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:41.794
Then somebody else from his
wife's family says,

00:14:41.794 --> 00:14:44.320
"Pedro,
the end is near.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.038
Don't you want us to get a
priest for the last

00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:49.279
rights?"
 

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:54.269
He'd never set foot in a church
and proudly so.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.840
Consternation on the other side
of the room.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.129
How will it all end?
 

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:00.960
How will Pedro end his life?
 

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.120
With a lawyer and a priest?
 

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.190
So, Pedro looks up and he says,
"Go and get me a lawyer.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.558
Bring me a lawyer."
 

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:13.985
Then he says,
"Go and tell father,"

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:18.409
the priest, "to come to
see me."

00:15:18.409 --> 00:15:22.928
Joy--utter consternation.
 

00:15:22.928 --> 00:15:25.620
Pedro's lying in a bed in the
middle.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.692
So, pretty soon the lawyer
comes dressed in his little

00:15:29.692 --> 00:15:30.230
suit.
 

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.940
He doesn't yet have a
calculator to tote up the bill,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.009
but he's got his legal pad.
 

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:38.908
He's never been in that house
before.

00:15:38.908 --> 00:15:43.200
He comes down by the bed and he
says, "Pedro,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.966
you have a few possessions,
a fork, a knife,

00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:48.980
a couple of plates.
 

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.710
Don't you want to give me your
will now?"

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.490
Pedro says, "Wait a minute.
 

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.230
Wait a minute,
señor.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.779
Wait a minute."
 

00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:59.470
Then the priest comes.
 

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:05.174
He has his purple--I remember
this from Jesuit high school

00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:09.080
days--thing that they wear on
Easter.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.135
He has his little case also,
which he has the holy oil to

00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:18.019
bless Pedro and give him the
last rights.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:21.523
He comes close and he says,
"Pedro,

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.139
the end is near.
 

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:27.062
You've led a good life,
but I haven't seen you in

00:16:27.062 --> 00:16:30.659
church very much or ever,
for that matter.

00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:32.649
Your children are not baptized.
 

00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:35.690
Don't you want to make a
confession?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.000
You're going to meet your maker
soon.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.309
Don't you want to make a
confession to me right now?

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:42.870
Nobody can hear you.
 

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.548
Don't you have something you
want to tell me?

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:54.009
Isn't there something you can
tell me?"

00:16:54.009 --> 00:17:00.070
Consternation on one side,
silent joy on the other.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.940
Pedro says to the lawyer,
"Come here,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.480
señor.
 

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.588
I want you to stand on the left
side of my bed."

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:10.933
He says to the priest,
"Father,

00:17:10.933 --> 00:17:12.750
come here please.
 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.818
I want you to stand on the
right side of my bed."

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:22.818
Then he smiles a smile of utter
contempt.

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:27.269
He says, "Now you can all
see both sides of the family.

00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:30.534
Like Christ,
I am dying between two

00:17:30.534 --> 00:17:32.069
thieves."
 

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:33.930
And he died.
 

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:40.386
To imagine the kind of hate
that anarchists had of soldiers,

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:44.000
and priests,
and of officials,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.920
and of Castilian Guardia Civil,
that was how anarchism was born.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.160
When was anarchism born?
 

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.423
There's a couple antecedents in
the eighteenth century,

00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:57.025
but they're terribly irrelevant
people that hardly anyone read,

00:17:57.025 --> 00:17:58.200
including a British one.
 

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.730
It really starts with Proudhon,
a name a sent around.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:09.068
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.
 

00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:13.296
He was from the east of France,
from Besançon,

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:16.710
in the mountainous
Franche-Comté.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.630
He believed that if you didn't
have the state,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.002
the people could live pretty
much as with a little bit of

00:18:22.002 --> 00:18:24.930
prosperity that they had,
a few chickens,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.259
a little piece of land.
 

00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:29.450
People tended to live like that
there.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.429
It was a place where nobody had
very much but everybody had

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:33.559
enough to get along.
 

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.460
He writes the following.
 

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.048
It's in my lecture notes.
 

00:18:40.048 --> 00:18:43.874
To be governed is to be
watched, inspected,

00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:47.104
spied upon, directed,
law-driven, numbered,

00:18:47.104 --> 00:18:48.794
regulated, enrolled,
indoctrinated,

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.009
preached at,
controlled, checked,

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:53.140
estimated, valued,
censored,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.713
commanded by creatures who have
neither the right nor the wisdom

00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:58.190
nor the virtue to do so.
 

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.624
To be governed at every
operation at every transaction,

00:19:01.624 --> 00:19:04.000
noted, registered,
counted, taxed,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.327
stamped, measured,
numbered, assessed,

00:19:06.327 --> 00:19:08.598
licensed, authorized,
admonished, prevented,

00:19:08.598 --> 00:19:11.759
forbidden, reformed,
corrected, punished,

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:15.104
under the pretext of public
utility in the name of the

00:19:15.104 --> 00:19:18.259
general interest to be placed
under taxes, drilled,

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:20.647
fleeced,
exploited, monopolized,

00:19:20.647 --> 00:19:24.230
extorted from,
squeezed, poached, and robbed.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.428
At the slightest resistance or
the first word of complaint to

00:19:27.428 --> 00:19:28.972
be repressed,
fired, vilified,

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:30.558
harassed,
hunted down,

00:19:30.558 --> 00:19:32.519
abused, clubbed,
disarmed,

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:34.836
bound, choked,
imprisoned, judged,

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:36.650
condemned,
shot, deported,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.390
sacrificed, sold,
betrayed,

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.839
and to crown all,
mocked, ridiculed,

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:43.630
derided, outraged, dishonored.
 

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.470
That is government.
 

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.109
That is its justice.
 

00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:49.519
That is its morality.
 

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:54.368
He wrote a pamphlet in 1841
called What is Property?

00:19:54.368 --> 00:19:58.298
His answer is,
"Property is theft."

00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:01.220
He didn't mean that all
property was theft.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.532
What he meant was too much
property was theft,

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:05.230
or unearned property was theft.
 

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.500
Proudhon had lots of influence
among some peasants,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.940
but mostly artisans.
 

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.220
In the world, by the way,
that the great painter,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.722
Gustave Courbet painted a lot,
in the area around

00:20:17.722 --> 00:20:21.393
Besançon or Nantes,
lots of really marvelous

00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:24.166
paintings of people at work,
the stone breakers and people

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.038
just working their guts out for
very little.

00:20:26.038 --> 00:20:29.748
Proudhon, in 1848,
it's said he went down in Paris

00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:33.001
and put a brick on a barricade
and threw up,

00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:37.240
nauseated by the thought of
violence, of revolution.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.183
His successors,
sort of the leaders of the

00:20:41.183 --> 00:20:51.430
anarchist movements,
were Mikhail Bakunin,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.660
an enormously tall, bearded,
heavy-drinking, heavy-eating,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.744
heavy-sweating Russian noble,
a prince who was an anarchist

00:21:01.744 --> 00:21:03.588
who said,
"The revolution will come.

00:21:03.588 --> 00:21:06.818
It will come with a single
spark and all the hundreds of

00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:09.578
millions of toilers,
the serfs will rise up,

00:21:09.578 --> 00:21:12.588
and they will slay their social
betters,

00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:16.250
and create this new brave world
based upon their village

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.450
harmonies."
 

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:23.483
He said, "Destruction is a
creative passion,"

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:26.390
entre guillemets.
 

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.650
Destruction is a creative
passion.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.390
In 1848 he led police on a
merry chase.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.608
He spent time in the Russian
slammer.

00:21:36.608 --> 00:21:39.737
He escapes through Japan,
goes through the United States

00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:42.410
and ends up back in London,
terrified people.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.346
His image, this is before
photographs or photographs are

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.801
just starting out,
and there are photographs of

00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:48.230
him.
 

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.758
He met Marx,
whom he hated,

00:21:50.758 --> 00:21:52.798
and Marx hated him.
 

00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:55.952
He thought that Marx was
ruining class struggle,

00:21:55.952 --> 00:21:59.576
was ruining revolution by
preaching over and over again

00:21:59.576 --> 00:22:01.789
about waiting for revolution.
 

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:03.068
Class-conscious workers.
 

00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:06.238
What you need is peasants to
rise up as they had in

00:22:06.238 --> 00:22:09.280
Pugachev's rebellion,
and all the other rebellions in

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.538
the early seventeenth and
eighteenth century.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:18.500
He dies in the early 1870s,
a phenomenal character.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.395
The other Russian,
a gentle man,

00:22:23.395 --> 00:22:27.977
a geographer,
Peter Kropotkin,

00:22:27.977 --> 00:22:33.980
K-R-O-P-O-T-K-I-N,
is in the book.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.279
He wrote a pamphlet called
The Anarchist Morality.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:39.358
When you get rid of the state,
people are basically good.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.009
Anarchists believe that people
are good.

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:43.410
There's a tradition from
Rousseau, by the way,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.048
there too.
 

00:22:44.048 --> 00:22:47.125
Rousseau, who lived in the east
of France, or what would become

00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:50.298
France, around Chambéry,
who believed in the primitive.

00:22:50.298 --> 00:22:52.624
Anarchists believe that
primitive social relations and

00:22:52.624 --> 00:22:54.509
even primitive ways of producing
things,

00:22:54.509 --> 00:22:59.569
just associations you enter in
because you want to,

00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:02.750
were the future.
 

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.493
Kropotkin, who at the end of
his life was once toasted by the

00:23:06.493 --> 00:23:09.145
king of England,
and who had turned against the

00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:11.200
Russian Revolution--he died in,
I think,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.838
1921 or 1922.
 

00:23:12.838 --> 00:23:16.133
He was terrified,
just disgusted by the Russian

00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:20.500
Revolution, which was already
creating a centralized state.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.500
That's what he hated.
 

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.558
He hated states.
 

00:23:22.558 --> 00:23:24.619
"You must destroy the
state."

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.578
But he was a gentle man.
 

00:23:26.578 --> 00:23:28.869
Yet he and a guy called Paul
Brousse,

00:23:28.869 --> 00:23:31.342
you don't have to remember,
who became a socialist leader

00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:34.390
and then went nuts later--that's
not a very clinical term,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.786
but he had big problems
later--they create the term

00:23:38.786 --> 00:23:42.039
"propaganda by the
deed."

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.809
What is a deed?
 

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:46.000
A deed is a bomb.
 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.880
A deed is an attack.
 

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.318
It's the murder of an official.
 

00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:52.858
The anarchists weren't the only
ones doing this stuff.

00:23:52.858 --> 00:23:55.270
There was a Russian group,
briefly mentioned,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.902
called Narodnaya Volya,
who believed in kind of a

00:23:57.902 --> 00:24:00.259
hierarchical post-revolutionary
system.

00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:02.558
What they wanted to do was set
out and kill officials.

00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:05.528
But so did the anarchist
terrorists.

00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:09.113
They killed officials,
one of which you've heard of

00:24:09.113 --> 00:24:09.828
already.
 

00:24:09.828 --> 00:24:11.190
You've probably heard of some
of the others.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.730
President McKinley in 1901,
Buffalo, New York,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.373
is killed by somebody who
received funds from an anarchist

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:21.313
organization in Patterson,
New Jersey, I think,

00:24:21.313 --> 00:24:22.720
or is that Bresci?
 

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.409
Anyway, Bresci kills King
Umberto I of Italy,

00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:29.259
another anarchist
assassination.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:33.407
They kill five or six leaders
during this period of anarchist

00:24:33.407 --> 00:24:36.519
heyday really,
the late nineteenth century.

00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:41.327
King Umberto I of Italy said
that he considered assassination

00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:43.088
a professional risk.
 

00:24:43.088 --> 00:24:46.633
There were two attempts on his
life and the third one nails

00:24:46.633 --> 00:24:47.000
him.
 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.117
Alexander II,
who liberated the serfs,

00:24:50.117 --> 00:24:55.007
is killed when he gets out of a
sled to look at a bomb that

00:24:55.007 --> 00:24:56.440
doesn't work.
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.223
Elizabeth, the empress of
Austria-Hungary,

00:24:59.223 --> 00:25:03.028
who couldn't stand Franz Joseph
and lived apart from him,

00:25:03.028 --> 00:25:04.930
is assassinated as well.
 

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:09.130
But most anarchists were not
killers.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.098
Now, if you think of American
history,

00:25:11.098 --> 00:25:12.589
those of you who had Glenda's
course,

00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:15.049
or David Blight's,
other people here,

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:17.990
you might know about Haymarket,
the Haymarket affair in the

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.400
1880s.
 

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.584
There they hanged four
anarchists who were called

00:25:20.584 --> 00:25:21.950
les pendus in France.
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.930
They had enormous influence.
 

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.061
The les pendus were the
hanged, as they're swinging in

00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:29.680
the breeze in a Chicago prison
yard.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.894
They were anarchists and they
inspire someone like Emma

00:25:32.894 --> 00:25:35.133
Goldman,
who was a Russian-Jewish

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:38.792
immigrant to the United States,
who becomes an important

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:40.029
American anarchist.
 

00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:46.241
Anarchists set off to kill
policemen, or to kill heads of

00:25:46.241 --> 00:25:51.432
state, or to kill generals;
propaganda by the deed,

00:25:51.432 --> 00:25:55.210
the spark that will ignite this
revolution.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.130
But the man you see before
you--and I have become today a

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.390
very modern man.
 

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.619
I want to tell you,
because this is my first try at

00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:04.460
PowerPoint.
 

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.047
The person that you see before
you is the guy I've been

00:26:08.047 --> 00:26:09.308
following around.
 

00:26:09.308 --> 00:26:12.058
I got interested in him for two
reasons.

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:17.419
One is that he is the first,
really, along with a bombing at

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:21.960
an opera in Barcelona,
the Liceo to target ordinary

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960
people.
 

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.582
To say that people of a social
class were guilty because they

00:26:26.582 --> 00:26:27.848
were who they were.
 

00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:33.430
The spark does not necessarily
have to be lit by killing a head

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.598
of a state.
 

00:26:34.598 --> 00:26:37.453
Sadi Carnot,
who would get his in 1894 on

00:26:37.453 --> 00:26:41.950
the Rue de la République
in Lyon, president of France.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.680
He takes the decision to kill
ordinary people.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.058
Lots of terrorists since then
have taken that decision.

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:57.694
A classic example is insurgents
in Punjab in India in the 1920s,

00:26:57.694 --> 00:27:01.259
bombing officers' clubs.
 

00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:03.568
There's a terrifying scene in
that fantastic,

00:27:03.568 --> 00:27:05.634
but very difficult
movie--because of the torture

00:27:05.634 --> 00:27:07.289
scene,
I can't even use it in the

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.858
French History course--The
Battle of Algiers.

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:13.038
You are with this woman who's
planting a bomb in a café

00:27:13.038 --> 00:27:15.490
and she sees the people who are
going to die.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.288
She sees babies with their
mothers.

00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:21.920
She sees people having a drink
in the French community there.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.990
She takes the decision to place
the bomb.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.519
I believe that it kind of
started with this guy.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:28.509
This is, again,
not somebody I admire.

00:27:28.509 --> 00:27:29.720
I know him.
 

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.368
Everywhere he's lived I've been.
 

00:27:32.368 --> 00:27:35.986
I guess if you're going to
write a book about somebody as a

00:27:35.986 --> 00:27:39.088
prism on something or other,
it's good to pick somebody who

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:41.990
only lived to be twenty-one,
because it's a shorter book.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.288
He was guillotined in May 1894.
 

00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:50.390
Again, I do not admire him,
but I'm going to tell you about

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.309
him anyway.
 

00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:54.500
With the help of PowerPoint!
 

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.358
How in the hell do I do this?
 

00:27:56.358 --> 00:27:57.410
I've got to remember how to do
this.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.250
All right.
 

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.328
That's Émile Henry.
 

00:28:00.328 --> 00:28:02.738
His father was a
communard who was

00:28:02.738 --> 00:28:05.567
condemned to death,
somebody who'd fought in the

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:06.289
Commune.
 

00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:09.160
So, this guy is born in Spain.
 

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.951
His father contracted mercury
poisoning in Spain,

00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:17.220
and comes back to France after
the amnesty and dies.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.779
He has an older brother and a
younger brother.

00:28:19.779 --> 00:28:25.890
What he does is,
on a day in 1894,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:32.845
he sets out with a bomb and he
walks in the fancy boulevards

00:28:32.845 --> 00:28:37.255
that, for him,
represent all of the class

00:28:37.255 --> 00:28:41.509
differences between wealthy and
poor people,

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:43.798
center versus periphery and all
of that.

00:28:43.798 --> 00:28:47.166
He goes down to the Café
Terminus, which is on your

00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:47.640
right.
 

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.118
It's those awnings there near
the Gare Saint-Lazare.

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:54.960
I've had the rather odd
experience of twice,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.460
once with friends and once with
my son,

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.710
having eaten in the restaurant
that my book subject blew up,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.440
because it's still there,
and sitting at the same table.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.038
He goes to four or five cafes,
but there are not enough

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:09.288
innocent people in them.
 

00:29:09.288 --> 00:29:13.035
So, he goes to the Terminus
where there is a gypsy orchestra

00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:14.940
playing, pays for two beers.
 

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.593
That seems a little odd,
anarchist paying for a beer,

00:29:17.593 --> 00:29:20.398
because the right to theft was
something that they still

00:29:20.398 --> 00:29:22.390
believed in, many of them,
not all.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.279
Most were not terrorists,
remember that.

00:29:38.788 --> 00:29:40.160
He goes into the Café
Terminus.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.109
He gets a cigar.
 

00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:43.000
He lights the fuse.
 

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.250
He throws it toward a
chandelier and it blows up,

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.569
killing one and wounding about
eighteen people.

00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:51.240
That's not him.
 

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.318
This anarchist is called
Malatesta, who doesn't look

00:29:53.318 --> 00:29:54.420
particularly scary there.
 

00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:00.930
Émile Henry had gone
back to the Paris region.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:06.470
His mother had a very pitiful
auberge.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.980
This is the era of bomb attacks
in the early 1890s.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.980
That's a marmite,
as bombs were sometimes called.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.200
He became an anarchist.
 

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.960
His brother had already become
an anarchist.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.140
To put yourself into the early
1890s in Paris,

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.413
ordinary people,
but not so much as the elites,

00:30:27.413 --> 00:30:31.130
were terrified of anarchist
bombers.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.528
Ravachol, a name I sent around,
who was a poor,

00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:38.518
pathetic in many ways but
extremely poor guy who'd been

00:30:38.518 --> 00:30:41.029
sent out to beg by his mother.
 

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:42.598
They had almost no money.
 

00:30:42.598 --> 00:30:44.244
They're from a place called
Saint-Chamond,

00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:45.368
near Saint-Étienne.
 

00:30:45.368 --> 00:30:50.868
Ravachol was a counterfeiter
and finally a murderer.

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:55.347
He suffocates to death a hermit
who had a mini fortune hidden in

00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:58.759
his bizarre cottage near
Saint-Étienne.

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:01.528
He escapes from the police and
he goes to Paris.

00:31:01.528 --> 00:31:05.704
In 1891 police beat the hell
out of three anarchists in a

00:31:05.704 --> 00:31:08.240
march, a rather one-sided brawl.
 

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.078
Two of them are condemned to
big-time sentences.

00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:17.250
Ravachol decides to go and to
kill the prosecuting attorney.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.497
He places a bomb,
not knowing where the apartment

00:31:20.497 --> 00:31:22.460
was, and the bomb blows up.
 

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.868
Then he set other bombs, too.
 

00:31:26.868 --> 00:31:29.586
After having done this,
he goes to a restaurant,

00:31:29.586 --> 00:31:32.477
and he eats rather well,
and he engages a waiter in

00:31:32.477 --> 00:31:33.460
conversation.
 

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.990
He tries to convince the waiter
to be an anarchist.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.104
The waiter sees he has a scar
on his left hand,

00:31:39.104 --> 00:31:40.118
Ravachol did.
 

00:31:40.118 --> 00:31:42.960
Then he stupidly goes back
later and eats in the same

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.670
restaurant.
 

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.784
Instead of bringing the second
course, the waiter brings the

00:31:46.784 --> 00:31:47.259
police.
 

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:51.319
After a tremendous struggle,
Ravachol is captured,

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:57.569
put on trial for his life,
and he memorably holds up--how

00:31:57.569 --> 00:32:06.619
do you work this thing?--anyway,
he is guillotined.

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:08.298
He's really kind of a bastard.
 

00:32:08.298 --> 00:32:10.817
More than that,
and he killed other people too,

00:32:10.817 --> 00:32:11.420
probably.
 

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.259
But he finally is guillotined.
 

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:17.700
Two things happened,
not only in Paris but in other

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.500
places.
 

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.656
The people of means living in
the fancy quarters are extremely

00:32:21.656 --> 00:32:22.328
frightened.
 

00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:24.598
There are all sorts of death
threats that get sent around.

00:32:24.598 --> 00:32:28.890
Ravachol, to those anarchist
terrorists, he becomes a martyr.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:33.880
Look, here his head is framed
by the guillotine.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.593
Ravachol, who had been betrayed
by an anarchist friend,

00:32:37.593 --> 00:32:39.450
dies at age thirty-three.
 

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.703
Christ died at age
thirty-three,

00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:45.118
betrayed by a friend.
 

00:32:45.118 --> 00:32:48.797
So, he becomes this sort of,
for radical anarchists,

00:32:48.797 --> 00:32:51.970
he becomes a vision of how life
should be.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.470
There are songs called La
Ravachol.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.077
There's another one called
The Dynamite Polka,

00:32:58.077 --> 00:32:58.980
being sung.
 

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.981
Dynamite, from the point of
view of anarchists,

00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:03.808
leveled the playing field.
 

00:33:03.808 --> 00:33:08.769
They viewed dynamite rather as
the way in which muskets helped

00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.210
end the domain of feudalism.
 

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.108
It levels the playing field.
 

00:33:14.108 --> 00:33:16.259
Dynamite, after all,
was invented by whom?

00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:18.660
By Nobel, as in the Nobel Prize.
 

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.490
So the people who support
dynamite in French are called

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.400
the dynamitards,
the dynamiters.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.460
The Dynamite Polka.
 

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.282
In Montmartre,
where you have a lot of

00:33:28.282 --> 00:33:29.859
anarchist writers and artists.
 

00:33:29.859 --> 00:33:33.430
Pizarro is an anarchist.
 

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.156
The literary and art critic,
above all art,

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:38.558
Félix
Fénéon,

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.049
who was a friend of
Émile Henry,

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:42.880
is an anarchist as well.
 

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.859
So, it's into this world that
the young Émile Henry.

00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:47.400
Here you go.
 

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.058
Here's this one.
 

00:33:48.058 --> 00:33:50.291
I've read hundreds of these
things that said,

00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:52.930
"You've always been hard
with your domestics.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.420
You're going to be blown up.
 

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.180
Death to the riches."
 

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:56.920
There are hundreds of these
things.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.900
They're sent all over Paris,
not just the fancy

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.588
neighborhoods.
 

00:33:59.588 --> 00:34:03.574
There, hundreds and hundreds of
times, at the airports you hear

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:07.173
these explosions sometimes as
they blow up suitcases that

00:34:07.173 --> 00:34:08.780
haven't been claimed.
 

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:14.170
That's the first known machine
that blows up suspect items,

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.793
including lots of bad
jokes--sardine cans with a

00:34:16.793 --> 00:34:18.860
little bit of powder left in
them,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.000
and that kind of thing.
 

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.873
It's in this world that Emile
Henry learns to hate,

00:34:24.873 --> 00:34:27.699
and that he certainly does.
 

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.929
That's where his mom had her
auberge.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:34.423
Ironically, it's near Euro
Disney now, but then it was a

00:34:34.423 --> 00:34:35.059
village.
 

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:35.739
That's not the one.
 

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:36.940
It was up the street a little
bit.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.429
I did follow him around,
you can see.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.889
There's his mother there.
 

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.889
Up on the right is one of the
places he lived,

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.266
always around,
except for one occasion,

00:34:47.266 --> 00:34:48.599
Montmartre.
 

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:51.250
That's his girlfriend.
 

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.530
He had unrequited love.
 

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.536
She had the disadvantage of
being married to another

00:34:54.536 --> 00:34:55.010
anarchist.
 

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.849
He writes her clumsy poems.
 

00:34:56.849 --> 00:34:57.840
He falls in love with her.
 

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.000
She blows him off.
 

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.030
But in the end,
she wanted to take full credit

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.434
before the press for having been
the lover of Émile Henry

00:35:05.434 --> 00:35:07.110
after his deeds,
his bombs,

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.300
but he wasn't.
 

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.110
That's one of the places he
worked in Paris.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.739
I love that.
 

00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:13.177
That's a beautiful sign and
that company hasn't existed

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.079
since World War I.
 

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.250
But you can follow him around.
 

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.603
In 1892, Émile Henry,
two years earlier,

00:35:20.603 --> 00:35:22.780
he had killed before.
 

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.554
There was a strike in the south
of France, glassworkers in

00:35:26.554 --> 00:35:27.150
Camaux.
 

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.146
The third block on the left is
number eleven and that's where

00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:32.280
the company is.
 

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.550
They found a bomb there placed
about 11:00 in the morning.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.070
Right there.
 

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.550
That's not the way it looked
then.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:43.489
I've gotten in there twice to
see where he placed the bomb.

00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:45.460
My son gets a little tired.
 

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.244
"Dad, do we have to look
at another one of these

00:35:47.244 --> 00:35:47.760
places?"
 

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.489
They find the bomb and they
carry it down to the police

00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:53.699
station, which is still there.
 

00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:57.172
It was a reversible bomb,
which means when the chemicals

00:35:57.172 --> 00:35:58.500
run together,
boom!

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.708
It kills five people terribly,
five policeman and a secretary

00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:03.619
among them.
 

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:06.110
Body parts all over the place.
 

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.507
Emile Henry,
that's one of the places he

00:36:08.507 --> 00:36:09.000
lived.
 

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.416
He is eliminated from the list
of suspects because they said he

00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:15.724
could not have gone on the two
errands his boss sent that day

00:36:15.724 --> 00:36:17.929
from near the station of the
north,

00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:19.768
down toward the center of
Paris,

00:36:19.768 --> 00:36:22.260
then up toward the Arc de
Triomphe,

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.980
gone back to Montmartre and
gotten the bomb,

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.034
placed the bomb,
and gotten back in two hours

00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:27.849
and fifteen minutes.
 

00:36:27.849 --> 00:36:31.780
When he went on trial for his
life in 1894,

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.684
a detective said, "Yes,
he could have done that in two

00:36:34.684 --> 00:36:35.659
hours and fifteen minutes."
 

00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:38.440
So, being a bit of an
empiricist, I did it.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.726
And I replaced tramway and
Omnibus with a bus and with a

00:36:42.726 --> 00:36:43.349
Metro.
 

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:46.239
I never take cabs, but I took,
instead of a carriage--of

00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:48.637
course I didn't take that--I
took a cab and I subtracted

00:36:48.637 --> 00:36:51.166
eleven minutes when my cab
couldn't turn left on the Avenue

00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:52.170
de l'Opéra.
 

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.940
He did it.
 

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.889
There's no question about it.
 

00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:58.452
In fact, when they did the
reconstitution of this building,

00:36:58.452 --> 00:37:00.440
he knew every single part of
this building.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.150
He did it.
 

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.610
There's no question about it.
 

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.940
Why did he hate so?
 

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.619
Part of it again,
this is the theme we've talked

00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:08.898
about before,
was the social geography of

00:37:08.898 --> 00:37:09.469
Paris.
 

00:37:09.469 --> 00:37:12.335
Everywhere he lived,
with one exception that you

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:14.409
just saw, was in people's Paris.
 

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:16.210
All of the facades are still
there.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.293
That's where he lived on the
Rue Véron,

00:37:19.293 --> 00:37:20.940
on the very top floor.
 

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.050
That's where the poor lived.
 

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.880
He gets the bomb there in 1892.
 

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.980
They hated Sacré-Coeur,
for reasons you already know.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.230
It was a symbol of penance for
the Franco-Prussian War and

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.170
penance for the commune.
 

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.039
His father was one of the
people condemned to death,

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:40.079
who was lucky enough to get out
and not be executed.

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:43.344
In a Zola novel that's very
underappreciated called

00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.659
Paris,
published in 1898,

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:49.409
it's about a priest who,
to take an REM song,

00:37:49.409 --> 00:37:51.130
is "losing his
religion."

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.268
His brother is an anarchist,
Guillaume.

00:37:54.268 --> 00:37:57.139
He has fantasies about blowing
this place up.

00:37:57.139 --> 00:37:59.659
I think it's ugly as hell.
 

00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:03.070
I once went with my wife to see
where they cast the huge bell

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.880
that would drive people nuts and
still does, called la Savoyarde.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.969
But that bell wasn't there.
 

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:10.141
But as a symbol,
you can't walk around

00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:12.960
Montmartre and not see it from
various places.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.034
He becomes a terrorist because
the people that he sees around

00:38:17.034 --> 00:38:18.869
him are very,
very poor,

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:20.811
and he convinces himself,
even though he's an

00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:22.590
intellectual,
he's a bourgeois.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.474
He could have gotten into the
École Polytechnique,

00:38:26.474 --> 00:38:29.250
which is a super,
Grande École.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.659
It's a big engineering school.
 

00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:31.800
He's a great student.
 

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.900
He's an intellectual.
 

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.510
That's the other thing.
 

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.710
Besides picking "innocent
people."

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.550
All people are innocent,
but you know what I mean.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.322
The other thing is he is not a
sad sack or a dangerous one like

00:38:43.322 --> 00:38:44.170
Ravachol.
 

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.570
He is not a guy called
Vaillant,

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.405
who places a little,
teeny tack bomb and throws it

00:38:49.405 --> 00:38:52.539
in the Chamber of Deputies to
call attention to the plight of

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:54.280
the poor,
and is guillotined.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.635
The first person in the
nineteenth century guillotined

00:38:56.635 --> 00:38:57.880
who did not kill somebody.
 

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.980
This guy goes out to kill.
 

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:05.338
There's a scene in an old
Balzac novel called--all Balzac

00:39:05.338 --> 00:39:09.684
novels by definition are old,
obviously--Old Goriot,

00:39:09.684 --> 00:39:13.559
Père Goriot,
in which Rastignac,

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:16.304
who was sort of this
down-and-out noble who wants to

00:39:16.304 --> 00:39:19.318
make the big time in Paris by
sleeping with all the right

00:39:19.318 --> 00:39:19.909
people.
 

00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:23.114
After Goriot dies,
he's up in the northeast

00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:27.159
quadrant of Paris at Père
Lachaise cemetery.

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:30.623
He waves his hand down toward
the fancy quarters,

00:39:30.623 --> 00:39:34.880
down ironically near where
Café Terminus would be.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.188
The fancy quarters,
even before there are

00:39:37.188 --> 00:39:38.860
boulevards,
and he says the equivalent of,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.840
"It's war between you and
me now, baby."

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.590
That's a rough translation,
but that's what he said.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.748
Émile Henry,
walking around on the hills and

00:39:46.748 --> 00:39:49.309
seeing people walk down to be
domestics,

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:52.409
because they couldn't afford to
take the tramway or the Omnibus,

00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:54.039
horse-drawn carriages.
 

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:57.702
He waves his hand and says,
"It's war between you and

00:39:57.702 --> 00:40:00.396
me, baby,
and I will ignite the spark

00:40:00.396 --> 00:40:03.449
that kills you MFs right
away."

00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:04.719
That's what he does.
 

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:06.500
When he walked out of his
apartment,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.003
he looked down and happily he
didn't have to see the Tour

00:40:11.003 --> 00:40:13.992
Montparnasse,
which hadn't been built after

00:40:13.992 --> 00:40:15.929
huge payoffs in the early 1970s.
 

00:40:15.929 --> 00:40:17.590
Disgusting!
 

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.842
But what he could see were
these symbols of capitalism,

00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:22.530
the state, and the church.
 

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.460
What did he see?
 

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.597
He saw the Eiffel Tower,
which was five years old,

00:40:26.597 --> 00:40:29.990
a symbol of the republic and
the bourgeois revolution,

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.079
as he saw it.
 

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:33.791
He sees the Pantheon,
where they buried all these

00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.728
Napoleonic marshals who
basically got a lot of people

00:40:36.728 --> 00:40:39.440
killed if they didn't get
themselves killed.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.550
And he sees Notre Dame.
 

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.639
He says, "It's war between
you and me."

00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:46.199
This is the façade.
 

00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:47.159
I love this stuff.
 

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:52.659
The inside building where he
lived isn't there anymore.

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:55.269
Now it's kind of an area that's
a little bit sketchy.

00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:56.610
There's a lot of drug dealing.
 

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.822
When I got myself into there,
I had to kind of--;I didn't

00:40:58.822 --> 00:41:00.599
want to look like a plainclothes
policeman.

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:02.949
Do I risk looking like a
plainclothes policeman?

00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:03.699
No.
 

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:07.518
I didn't want to look like a
tourist sort of slumming.

00:41:07.518 --> 00:41:09.090
I don't look like that much,
either.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.094
When I went by these guys who
were sort of hanging out there,

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:12.027
I said,
"Salut les

00:41:12.027 --> 00:41:13.088
gars,"
or "Hi guys,

00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:13.719
what's up?"
 

00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:16.599
I got myself in there to see
where he once had lived.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:20.139
The point of that is that you
can see what he saw.

00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:24.023
That gate is exactly the same
as that day when he walked out

00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:26.000
to kill for the second time.
 

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.635
His bomb that he threw into the
Terminus--this is back in 1894,

00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:34.090
this is where we started.
 

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.309
It hit a chandelier and
exploded.

00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:40.260
He said at his trial that he
threw it too low.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.693
He should have thrown it higher;
it would have killed more

00:41:42.693 --> 00:41:42.980
people.
 

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.280
Only one died.
 

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.019
He'd already killed five before.
 

00:41:46.019 --> 00:41:47.960
People are terrified.
 

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.050
They run all over the place.
 

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.880
It was speculated that his was
sort of an indirect suicide,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.530
because his unrequited love,
this lady who lived in the

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:02.909
Boulevard Voltaire,
whose name was Elisa.

00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:06.199
But no, because he tries to
escape in order to kill again.

00:42:06.199 --> 00:42:08.010
They chase him and they catch
him.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.389
A barber helps catch him.
 

00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:13.271
A controller on the tramway
hits him with the control

00:42:13.271 --> 00:42:17.125
mechanism that punches tickets,
just like in the old days on

00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:18.815
those things,
not that I ever was in a

00:42:18.815 --> 00:42:19.719
horse-drawn carriage.
 

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:22.039
They get him and they take him.
 

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:26.532
He's arrested for murder,
Émile Henry,

00:42:26.532 --> 00:42:28.780
and is put on trial.
 

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.360
That's where he's writing his
mother.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.282
We know a lot about him,
because they kept all these

00:42:34.282 --> 00:42:34.969
documents.
 

00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:37.139
It was so fun doing this.
 

00:42:37.139 --> 00:42:38.110
I love stuff like that.
 

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:42.429
His mother was devastated,
as you can well imagine.

00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:44.958
She cannot believe that her
Émile could have done

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:45.280
this.
 

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.139
He was her pride and joy after
the death of the father.

00:42:50.139 --> 00:42:53.360
Those of you who have been to
Paris will recognize this.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.719
This is the Conciergerie.
 

00:42:54.719 --> 00:42:58.889
This is where Louis XVI,
Danton, Robespierre,

00:42:58.889 --> 00:43:01.199
Marie Antoinette,
and others awaited,

00:43:01.199 --> 00:43:03.760
they put their head between the
little window,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.403
as they used to say,
la petite

00:43:05.403 --> 00:43:07.518
fenêtre, to be
guillotined.

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:10.905
It's also got one of the three
most magnificent gothic halls

00:43:10.905 --> 00:43:12.110
anywhere in France.
 

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:16.322
His guards took notes every
single day about what he said

00:43:16.322 --> 00:43:18.280
and the anarchist songs.
 

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.835
They want to prove that
somebody else was involved in

00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:23.449
this.
 

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:26.432
There probably was somebody
else in the 1892 attack who

00:43:26.432 --> 00:43:27.980
helped him close the bomb.
 

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:35.820
So, Emile Henry goes on trial
in April of 1894.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.534
He makes the famous declaration
in which he says,

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:44.364
"You have hung us in
Chicago,"

00:43:44.364 --> 00:43:47.019
Haymarket;
"You have garroted

00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:49.079
us," that's slowly
strangling us,

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:50.639
"in Barcelona."
 

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:55.092
When Franco was croaking in
1975, they were garroting an

00:43:55.092 --> 00:43:59.059
anarchist even at that time,
1975 in Barcelona.

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:00.809
"You have shot us in
Germany."

00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:02.498
I don't know how they killed
them in Italy,

00:44:02.498 --> 00:44:04.309
but, "You've killed us in
Italy."

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:06.860
He says, "You,
the bourgeois,

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.880
who are in this café,
you are not innocent.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.139
It's because of you,
the petty bourgeois.

00:44:13.139 --> 00:44:14.744
You support les
gros,"

00:44:14.744 --> 00:44:16.496
the big ones,
"on every possible

00:44:16.496 --> 00:44:17.130
occasion.
 

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.670
You forget about us when your
factory owners throw us out when

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.349
we can no longer work any
longer,

00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:27.900
or women workers happy not to
have had to prostitute

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.358
themselves in order to pay their
rent and their husbands' rent by

00:44:32.358 --> 00:44:34.099
the end of the month.
 

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:36.659
But what you can never do is
destroy anarchism.

00:44:36.659 --> 00:44:39.679
Its roots are too deep."
 

00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:43.572
On the 22^(nd) of May
1894--that's what I said about

00:44:43.572 --> 00:44:48.152
writing a book about somebody
that doesn't live very long--he

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:51.891
is executed at Place Roquette in
Paris, which was,

00:44:51.891 --> 00:44:55.800
by intent,
the place where the state meted

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.235
out justice,
right in the heart of

00:44:58.235 --> 00:44:59.489
working-class Paris.
 

00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:02.518
That was not an idle selection
of a space.

00:45:02.518 --> 00:45:07.909
We have his notes up to the
very end of his life.

00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:10.750
This guy, Deibler,
is the executioner.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:14.280
Monsieur de Paris.
 

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.369
This is the executioner meting
out, in quotes,

00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:20.369
"justice."
 

00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:23.288
Public execution,
by the way, in France,

00:45:23.288 --> 00:45:27.478
maybe I said this already,
was in 1936 at Versailles--the

00:45:27.478 --> 00:45:29.800
last execution was in 1974.
 

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.940
I'm constantly asked by people
all sorts of political opinions

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.559
in France,
where executions,

00:45:35.559 --> 00:45:38.940
public capital punishment is
repudiated by most everybody,

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.380
how that we still have it here.
 

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.545
This is not a political
diatribe, so I won't say

00:45:42.545 --> 00:45:43.559
anything about that.
 

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:47.016
Anyway, Deibler,
his son was the last public

00:45:47.016 --> 00:45:51.440
executioner, did the last public
execution back when.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.610
There he is.
 

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.742
There's somebody else putting
their head through the little

00:45:56.742 --> 00:45:57.230
window.
 

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.289
That's what I mean by that.
 

00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:06.179
That's the equivalent of his
mug shot.

00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:13.331
So, he was wrong about the
roots of anarchism being too

00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:14.260
deep.
 

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.070
What clearly happens is that
there was a trial during that

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:22.148
same summer where they put a lot
of intellectuals on trial who

00:46:22.148 --> 00:46:25.891
did nothing except to say that
they were anarchists or to

00:46:25.891 --> 00:46:27.630
criticize the state.
 

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.108
What my book--it's really a
book also about state

00:46:30.108 --> 00:46:30.780
terrorists.
 

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.679
It's about the overreaction of
states.

00:46:34.679 --> 00:46:36.360
Our state is a good example of
that,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.659
and the tendency to try to
denigrate anyone who doesn't

00:46:39.659 --> 00:46:41.920
agree with us as being
terrorists,

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.690
whether they were or not.
 

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:47.269
The intellectuals,
the jury sees through it in

00:46:47.269 --> 00:46:51.963
1894 and only a couple thieves
are condemned and them not to

00:46:51.963 --> 00:46:52.760
death.
 

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.360
There's anarchists in 1968 in
Paris.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.969
There's a band of anarchists in
about 1909,1910,

00:47:00.969 --> 00:47:04.657
1911, that hold up stores with
most modern tools,

00:47:04.657 --> 00:47:07.269
shotguns and things like that.
 

00:47:07.269 --> 00:47:09.889
The anarchist attacks were over.
 

00:47:09.889 --> 00:47:10.900
There was no question about
that.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.760
That doesn't make Émile
Henry less interesting.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.724
As an intellectual,
the cross-class kind of--you

00:47:15.724 --> 00:47:18.500
see this in Middle-Eastern
terrorism, too.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.539
My book is also about state
terrorists.

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:26.373
What stops anarchist attacks in
Spain is the fact that the

00:47:26.373 --> 00:47:31.460
public becomes aware that the
police were hideously torturing

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.550
people who did not agree with
the politics of the State.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.550
They were torturing them.
 

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.077
You see where one could go in a
political diatribe,

00:47:41.077 --> 00:47:42.420
which this isn't.
 

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.726
In Italy when the state
overreacts, anarchist attacks

00:47:47.726 --> 00:47:49.360
virtually end.
 

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.679
Now, anarchism does not end in
Spain.

00:47:51.679 --> 00:47:54.425
It does not end also for
reasons that are perfectly clear

00:47:54.425 --> 00:47:55.699
already in Buenos Aires.
 

00:47:55.699 --> 00:47:59.208
There's still a huge anarchist
community of exiles from these

00:47:59.208 --> 00:48:02.657
Western European countries from
all over the place living in

00:48:02.657 --> 00:48:04.932
London,
ironically in one of the more

00:48:04.932 --> 00:48:07.699
chi-chi parts of London which
was then very poor,

00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:09.952
around Charlotte Street,
where you can't afford to have

00:48:09.952 --> 00:48:10.900
a pint of beer anymore.
 

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.769
That's where they live.
 

00:48:12.769 --> 00:48:14.730
So, he was wrong about that.
 

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.670
The roots of anarchism were too
great.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.289
But the connection that I want
to make, obviously,

00:48:20.289 --> 00:48:22.628
especially since this is being
filmed it's not the place to do

00:48:22.628 --> 00:48:23.699
it,
but when states,

00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:28.750
including our own, overreact,
what they tend to do is to lash

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.545
out in ways,
and imprison unjustly,

00:48:31.545 --> 00:48:33.610
and torture,
and don't give legal rights.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:38.302
What they do is tend to
increase the number of those

00:48:38.302 --> 00:48:40.510
people who despise us.
 

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.208
If you look back,
and again the commune is not a

00:48:43.208 --> 00:48:46.193
bad way of thinking about this,
somebody figured out that of

00:48:46.193 --> 00:48:48.650
all the victims of terrorist
attacks,

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.021
no matter how you define them,
the ratio between victims of

00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:55.525
overreaction by states to
victims of anarchist terror--and

00:48:55.525 --> 00:48:58.230
I'm not apologizing for
anarchist terror.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.960
I hate it.
 

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.289
I'm not apologizing for terror
of any kind.

00:49:01.289 --> 00:49:02.389
I hate it.
 

00:49:02.389 --> 00:49:05.699
But the ratio was 260:1.
 

00:49:05.699 --> 00:49:09.340
I suppose there's a lesson to
be learned there somewhere.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.059
But it was fun to follow Emile
Henry around,

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:17.106
even though I don't admire him,
and to try to give you a sense

00:49:17.106 --> 00:49:21.559
of how people felt when they
hated in the 1890s.

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:25.429
Their answer was not the same
answer as socialists,

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:28.989
which are to take power mostly
through electoral processes,

00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:32.289
but to smash the state by
blowing it up.

00:49:32.289 --> 00:49:33.679
See you on Monday.

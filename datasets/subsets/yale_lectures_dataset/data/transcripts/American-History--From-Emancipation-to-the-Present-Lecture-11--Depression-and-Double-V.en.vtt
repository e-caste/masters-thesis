00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.967
For the purpose
of this week,

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:08.500
we'll essentially be
resting in the 1930s,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.667
essentially.&nbsp; It's a week's
worth of lecture dealing

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:18.700
with the Great Depression.&nbsp;
In October of 1929,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.100
the stock market crashes,
and in a quick cascade of

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.800
events, Herbert
Hoover, then the President,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.667
finds himself out of office
and Franklin Roosevelt is

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.000
elected
promising a New Deal,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.400
a New Deal for America.&nbsp;
This week's lectures are

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
about the Great Depression,
Roosevelt's New Deal,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
and several critical moments
and developments related to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.067
the African American
experience.&nbsp; And I want you

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.800
to--We should all start with
a basic understanding of my

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.167
approach to the nineteen--to
the 1930s.&nbsp; If the twenties

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:52.600
can be understood as the
decade of the New Negro,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.900
a new sort of social and
cultural and political world

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.700
view, the 1930s needs to be
understood as a decade of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.167
retrenchment and political
advancement.&nbsp; We've seen

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.867
this before, going into the
late nineteenth century and

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:12.767
into the turn of the
twentieth century.&nbsp; And

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.700
we're just seeing a--a new
cycle of people gathering

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.067
themselves up and
articulating new visions and

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:22.500
new agendas, or new, new
methods to pursue on these

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.467
agendas for the future.&nbsp;
As far as retrenchment,

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.600
after so many cultural
celebrations and giddiness

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.000
of the Jazz
Age, as, you know,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.100
the soldiers
that have returned,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.400
the economic downturn made a
different--not new really,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.300
but a different set of
priorities come to the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.300
surface.&nbsp; The economy's
in tatters and African

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.800
Americans are the
hardest hit.&nbsp; And as far as

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.967
political
advancement is concerned,

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:53.067
along with the retrenchment
comes a range of political

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:57.800
responses to these
setbacks that demonstrate an

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.700
independence of spirit among
African Americans as far as

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.000
political possibilities.&nbsp;
Now this retrenchment and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.967
political advancement, I
don't want to make too much

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:13.500
of a big deal.&nbsp; One can
identify these themes in any

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
particular decade or
moment in time of course.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.100
But there is--there's
something very special I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.000
think about the 1930s as
far as these aspects are

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.700
concerned.&nbsp; The 1930s forms
the backdrop for the modern

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
civil rights movement, that
movement that is popularly

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.400
thought of as
occurring from Brown v.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.767
Board's decision in 1954 up
until King's assassination.&nbsp;

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:39.900
As you'll come to
understand very quickly,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.267
that notion, boundedness of
the civil rights movement,

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:48.200
is really sort of discarded
by historians at this

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.900
point.&nbsp; And many historians
are talking about a long

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.700
civil rights movement, a
movement that predates the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.967
Supreme Court decision and
goes back a decade or more.&nbsp;

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:03.600
I'll talk more about
this in a--in a week or so,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.767
this phenomenon of the long
civil rights movement.&nbsp; But

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.200
regardless of where one
decides to sort of start the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.700
civil rights movement,
you need to understand the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.100
thirties is
clearly the seedbed,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.067
the moment where a whole
new range of political

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:19.600
strategies are going
to be articulated,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.700
and these grow out of
this moment of retrenchment,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.900
trying to gathers--gather
oneself together in light of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.100
economic despair.&nbsp; Now I
want to cover the story of

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100
the 1930s.&nbsp; I
mean for any era,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.900
there's too many different
stories one could tell,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.100
but I want to explore the
themes of retrenchment and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.000
political advancement in
the 1930s via a number of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.300
stories.&nbsp; And this covers
this lecture and Wednesday's

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.400
lecture.&nbsp; I'll be talking
about the Black Cabinet,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
the Scottsboro Boys,
the New Negro Alliance,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.000
the National Negro Congress,
Marian Anderson and the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.200
March on Washington
movement.&nbsp; This is a series

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.500
of different--different
kinds of events that really

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.800
marked, marked us right
through the 1930s with the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.767
March on Washington movement
taking shape in 1941.&nbsp;

00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:22.600
Throughout this whole era,
or this era--the umbrella

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.000
covering this era,
is the New Deal,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.500
and that's what I want to
start off with very quickly,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.900
so we have just a--sort of a
shared understanding of what

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.200
the New Deal is doing and
why it's important.&nbsp; So the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.467
stock market
crashes in October,

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:42.200
'29.&nbsp; The country's
economically destabilized,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.467
millions are thrown out
of work.&nbsp; Black and white

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:47.400
unemployment skyrocketed,
but blacks are particularly

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.600
hard hit.&nbsp; Job shortages and
old-fashioned racism combine

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.700
in such a way that a
familiar--familiar rallying

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.800
cry would be hear--heard at
job lines and such when a

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.300
black person showed
up.&nbsp; And I'm quoting,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.400
"No jobs for niggers until
every white man has a job."&nbsp;

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.700
A time of
economic stress, good,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.267
old-fashioned racism
makes itself known loud and

00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:16.800
clear.&nbsp; Even in such
major cities like Atlanta,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.467
some sixty-five percent of,
of employable blacks needed

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:24.100
public assistance.&nbsp; This
is economic devastation.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.400
Hoover believed in
volunteerism and thought the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.767
economy would turn itself
around without government

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:31.300
intervention.&nbsp; But by the
time he realized the scope

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.200
of the problem, he
found himself losing the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.000
presidential
election.&nbsp; FDR's elected,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.600
promises a New Deal.&nbsp; Now
the New Deal's a massive

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.567
federal experiment in
big government.&nbsp; It was an

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:46.100
alphabet soup, as, as
historians refer to it,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.700
an alphabet
soup of agencies,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.100
each representing
different forms of federal

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.300
intervention.&nbsp; And I'm
putting a--sev--a whole

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.367
bunch of them,
not all of them,

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:58.400
up on the board here, and
I'm going to very quickly go

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.867
through them to help you
understand the scope of the

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:05.500
change.&nbsp; You have the
FSA, or the Farm Security

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.600
Administration,
and the Agricultural

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.400
Adjustment--Adjustment
Administration,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.900
two that are organizations
that are very important to

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.300
African Americans, aside
from being important to all

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.400
Americans, because
African Americans are still

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.300
predominantly--although
it's shifting--still

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.467
predominantly an
agricultural population.&nbsp;

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.167
They had the
National Recovery Act,

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:30.667
the NRA--that and I'll get
into a little more about the

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:33.100
NRA, it's very important,
in a few minutes--that among

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.367
other things establishes
the minimum wage,

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:37.767
or establishes minimum wages
is the better way to put

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:42.867
it.&nbsp; And there's a very
curious relationship with

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:44.967
African American--African
Americans and the jobs that

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:49.767
they hold.&nbsp; The Tennessee
Valley Authority and the

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:54.667
Rural--Rural
Electric--Electrification

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:56.500
Administration, these are
up here really to point out

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.700
what kind of radical change
the New Deal is really all

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.967
about.&nbsp; This is an era when
they're actually bringing

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:04.667
electricity for the first
time to large parts of the

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:11.400
country through, through the
TVA and hydroelectricity and

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.167
rural electrification.&nbsp; It's
a radical reordering of how

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.600
the country's going to
work.&nbsp; National Youth

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.000
Administration, NYA,
which as we'll see,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.567
I'll talk briefly
about it later on,

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:27.767
is one of these many
administrations that has a

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:31.700
Negro division, and the
Negro division becomes

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.100
important.&nbsp; I mean I'll,
I'll--You can bookmark it

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.200
for the moment.&nbsp;
Civilian Conservation Corps,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.000
the CCC, literally putting
mostly men to work by

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.900
digging ditches,
planting trees,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.300
giving them some sort of job
to do so they can get some

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.900
wage from the
federal government,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.167
so they can feed
themselves.&nbsp; Public Works

00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:56.467
Administration, the Works
Progress Administration,

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:02.100
the PWA turns into the
WPA, doing work on public

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.967
projects.&nbsp; Social
Security is established,

00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:10.167
the Securities and Exchange
Commission is established,

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:12.900
the FDIC, the
Federal Emergency Relief

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.567
Administration.&nbsp; All of
these are brand new during

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:19.200
this era.&nbsp; So what we
consider the essential work

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.700
of the federal
government is,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.600
in our contemporary moment
is essentially created

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:31.100
during the New Deal.&nbsp; All is
a radical attempt to end the

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.000
Great Depression.&nbsp; And
we have been wrestling,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.300
we, political
leaders, activists,

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.800
have been wrestling with the
legacy of the New Deal ever

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.700
since.&nbsp; Now the point
of listing all of these

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.800
agencies up here is not just
that many of these had a

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.400
direct effect on African
American employment and,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.400
as you'll see,
political possibility,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.800
but it also will
bring into--I'm sort of

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.100
for--projecting here a
bit--it will underscore

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.367
changes--how can I...not
changes--articulations,

00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:11.600
new articulations of changes
in terms of the limits of

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.000
the federal government.&nbsp;
We'll see during our lecture

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.300
of the civil
rights movement,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.200
there's a core issue and
that's the fed--limits of

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.700
federal government versus
states' government.&nbsp; With

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.600
the explosion in the size
of the federal government,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.867
you can see this problem
looming ever larger on the

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:30.500
horizon.&nbsp; Now very
basic questions,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.000
was the New Deal
successful?&nbsp; It's all an

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.100
experiment.&nbsp;
And economically,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.900
the answer is mixed.&nbsp;
Yes, there is no doubt,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.400
it saved millions
from starvation,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.567
I mean, literally saving
folks from starving to

00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:47.067
death.&nbsp; But the economy
doesn't actually turn around

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:48.067
until the U.S.

00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:50.800
begins arming Europe as it
heads toward Second World

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.900
War.&nbsp; When the U.S.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.300
becomes a military factory
and then itself becomes

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.700
involved in the
Second World War,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.700
that's when the economy
turns--absolutely booms and

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.600
it turns around at that
point.&nbsp; So economically it

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.100
saves people from starving
but it doesn't turn the

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.100
economy
around.&nbsp; Politically,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.600
it's much more complicated.&nbsp;
From an institutional

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.867
standpoint, there's no
doubt that the New Deal's

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.400
significant.&nbsp; Whether it's
successful I guess might be

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.800
an interesting word to
wrest with here because,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.900
as I said before, it
makes the modern American

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.300
political state.&nbsp; It does it
in the space of just a few

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.200
years.&nbsp; Now from the
standpoint of the African

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.800
American experience, was the
New Deal successful in terms

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.300
of politics here?&nbsp;
There's a real mixed record.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.467
On the ground, too many
federal programs were left

00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:45.600
to local
administrators to run.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.900
So you have--and this is
where something like the

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.200
Farm Security
Administration,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.300
Agricultural
Administration--Adjustment

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.000
Administration, are really
important.&nbsp; Federal policy

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.400
is saying you're not
going to discriminate.&nbsp;

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.167
Everybody's going to get a
sh--a cut of this New Deal.&nbsp;

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:04.700
But the bailouts are handed
out at the local level,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.600
at the local Farm
Bureau, let's say,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.000
and localized racial
practices simply just don't

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.400
disappear.&nbsp; So you have
growing out of the New Deal,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.600
or during the New Deal,
American farms being saved,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.600
but the farms that are being
saved overwhelmingly are

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.200
those that are white-owned
and not black-owned.&nbsp; So

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.967
when you think of the New
Deal from the standpoint of

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:31.300
did it benefit
African Americans,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.867
you can look at federal--at,
at the sort of national

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:38.800
policy and see something,
non-discrimination pacts,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.400
but local level's
where it really matters,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:48.200
you see a very different
story there.&nbsp; Now just as

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.200
some of these--many of these
New Deal programs were doing

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.867
something important by being
non-discriminatory in their

00:11:53.867 --> 00:11:58.600
language, and then therefore
at the local level being

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.400
more complicated, they
weren't all perfect at the

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.600
federal level of
articulation.&nbsp; And this is

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.700
where the NRA, the National
Recovery Administration,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.000
really needs to be
understood.&nbsp; As I said

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.467
before, the NRA designed
a set of minimum wages,

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:17.400
basically wage standards,
across the country.&nbsp; So,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.000
for instance, if you
are rolling steel,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.400
you're going to get paid a
certain minimum wage.&nbsp; If

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.667
you are--boy, of the
billion and a half jobs,

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.300
I can't think of
anything right now.&nbsp; If

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.300
you're--[laughs] God, pick
a job--you are doing some

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.967
other mechanized thing,
how's that for a complete

00:12:43.967 --> 00:12:46.400
bailout?&nbsp; You're going
to get paid a certain set

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.700
wage.&nbsp; Now the reason
I was flailing here,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.800
because there are certain
areas the NRA doesn't

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.200
address the minimum wage,
and I kept wanting to say

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.300
those things; That's why I
was fumbling.&nbsp; It does not

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.167
establish minimum wages
for people in agricultural

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.467
sector.&nbsp; It does not set
minimum wages for people

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:09.667
doing domestic work.&nbsp; Guess
what African Americans are

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:12.700
mostly employed in:
agricultural work and

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.600
domestic work.&nbsp; Now there
are all kinds of reasons

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.100
that people who conceived
the NRA had for not putting

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.100
floors at, at certain wages
for certain industries,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.800
agriculture and domestic
work in this case.&nbsp; They

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.000
weren't
explicitly about, "Oh,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.700
let's stick it to these
people."&nbsp; But the fact was,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.367
the effect was, they were
sticking it to these people,

00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:41.567
to farmers in general and to
people doing domestic work.&nbsp;

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.267
The NRA then becomes a
symbol for how little the

00:13:48.267 --> 00:13:53.600
New Deal was doing for black
America.&nbsp; Long term effects,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.300
there's no doubt,
very important,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.867
and we'll see that in
the next couple of weeks,

00:13:57.867 --> 00:14:01.900
from the concept of what the
federal government is.&nbsp; From

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.667
an institutional standpoint,
there's no doubt,

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:04.700
it's important,
it's critical,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.300
it's saving lives.&nbsp; When it
comes to black life on the

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.300
ground, a mixed bag.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.400
When it comes to NRA, which
had really more power than

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.700
any other of these
administrations to change

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.800
the quality of black life,
to sort of bolster it up,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.600
no dice.&nbsp; So African
Americans start calling the

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.000
National Recovery
Administration,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.067
the letters NRA, referred
to as Negro Rights Abused,

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:33.900
Negro Rights Assassinated,
Negro Removal Act,

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:41.667
Negroes Ruined Again.&nbsp;
Now we're talking bread and

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:44.500
butter issues here.&nbsp; But
politics of course exist at

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.100
the symbolic level, and
when it comes to African

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.100
Americans, there is no
doubt that symbolically,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.400
the New Deal was an
overwhelming success.&nbsp; The

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.667
political symbolism of the
New Deal for blacks came

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:06.900
mostly through the
establishment of a group

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.200
called the Federal
Council on Negro Affairs,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.300
the Black Cabinet.&nbsp; They're
the same thing.&nbsp; The Black

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.000
Cabinet was an
unofficial--it's important

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.667
to understand that part--an
unofficial collection of

00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:26.500
race advisors, and
that was their title,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.067
who stood in various
places in Roosevelt's

00:15:28.067 --> 00:15:30.067
administration.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.367
This was the first
broad-based group of

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:40.467
federally
appointed bureaucrats and

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.567
administrators who
were African American,

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.100
at the federal
government--in the federal

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.700
government's history.&nbsp;
Prior to this moment,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.967
you might have Frederick
Douglass appointed to

00:15:48.967 --> 00:15:50.667
federal position, Booker T.

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.800
Washington being consulted
by the President about

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.000
certain kinds of ideas and
policies.&nbsp; But in the New

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.767
Deal, you're
actually getting a,

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:06.767
a cadre of African Americans
with federal appointments,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.267
working within the
administration on a

00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:16.600
full-time basis.&nbsp; The
members of the Black Cabinet

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.167
were all highly-educated
and all male,

00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:23.967
with the lone exception
of Mary McLeod Bethune,

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:29.967
who was the one, well,
one female.&nbsp; Seems my,

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:34.700
there we go.&nbsp; Mary McLeod
Bethune.&nbsp; And the spelling

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.200
is correct and the
pronunciation's correct,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.600
it's "McCloud."&nbsp;
Mary McLeod Bethune,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.867
the sole female in
the Black Cabinet,

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:47.600
who also happened to be
regarded as the cabinet's

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.367
leader.&nbsp; Now the
Cabinet, the Black Cabinet,

00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:56.700
leaves no discernible policy
record or legacy.&nbsp; Their

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.500
job, the job, the
things they did were mainly

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.067
accomplished
behind the scenes.

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:03.000
And, in fact,
I, I know this,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
this--I planned to write my
dissertation on the Black

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.700
Cabinet, only to
discover, once I got here,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:14.700
there was no record.&nbsp; So,
new dissertation topic.&nbsp;

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.600
Their job was mainly
conducted behind the scenes,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.400
so you'd have a
Secretary of the Interior,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.900
or a Secretary
of Agriculture,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.400
wanting to, you know, find
out what's going on with

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.567
black America.

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:30.267
They have a race advisor,
and they would assign

00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:32.200
him--overwhelmingly
him, of course,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.567
except for Mary McLeod
Bethune--the task of finding

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.467
out, or being the,
the touchstone to,

00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:40.400
to understand what's
happening in black America.&nbsp;

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.067
And there might be
an issue bubbling up,

00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:45.500
say in the National
Parks or some other place,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.467
that the race
advisor might know about,

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:51.267
and would put sort of a
bug in his boss's ear,

00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:54.067
and it might gently change
administration policy,

00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:57.400
or maybe even law that way.&nbsp;
But we don't actually know

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.600
the literal changes they
made.&nbsp; But we do know that

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:10.200
they were very important
symbolically.&nbsp; And the most

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.967
important person
symbolically in this regard

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:14.600
is Mary McLeod
Bethune.&nbsp; Bethune,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.300
who's the head of the
Negro Youth Division of the

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300
National Youth
Administration,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.600
an educator,
lifelong educator,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.100
and then, most importantly,
a close friend of the first

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.767
lady, Eleanor
Roosevelt.&nbsp; Bethune is seen,

00:18:32.767 --> 00:18:38.500
seen to be the voice of
black America in so many

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.100
ways, in this,
in this, in the,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.600
the Black Cabinet, that is,
because she had access.&nbsp; And

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.100
there was--it was op--it was
not a secret.&nbsp; It was well

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.300
known that if you wanted to
talk to Franklin Roosevelt

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.500
and you're African American,
you had to go through

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.700
Eleanor Roosevelt, and
if you wanted to talk to

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.700
Eleanor Roosevelt, you had
to go through Mary McLeod

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:06.567
Bethune to get access.&nbsp; So
the Black Cabinet needs to

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:12.000
be understood as the first
political insiders in black

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
America, and I'm talking
high politics here.&nbsp; This is

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.900
an era where the Black
Cabinet officers would be

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.600
trotted out.&nbsp;
Pictures of them,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.500
or sometimes
themselves literally,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.867
trotted out, sent on sort of
as part of a delegation to a

00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:40.600
particular area of
town, the country,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.300
representing the federal
government to a black

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.900
enclave.&nbsp; And they were seen
as embodying the fact that

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.767
Roosevelt cared.&nbsp; Whether
you're talking Mary McLeod

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:51.500
Bethune or somebody else,
Roosevelt cared because he

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.400
had people appointed to
express or deal with,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.267
address their concerns.&nbsp;
This is how they're

00:19:57.267 --> 00:19:59.900
symbolically so important,
and it's also important to

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.400
know that over the
course of the 1930s,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.500
during FDR's presidency,
through the interventions of

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.900
the New Deal,
sometimes literally,

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.367
most often symbolically,
African Americans turn from

00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:14.167
a Republican
voting population to a

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:16.667
Democrat--Democratic voting
population.&nbsp; A complete

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:22.800
shift by the time you get to
the late 1930s.&nbsp; The Black

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.167
Cabinet's important in that
process.&nbsp; Now just as you're

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:32.700
seeing the establishment
of the first sort of

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.000
professional
administrators, bureaucrats,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.300
African American, in
the federal government,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.400
certainly at high level,
there is--this is also an

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.567
era of incredible political
setback and disappointment.

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:49.400
So you see the great
political possibility of the

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.800
Black Cabinet, but you also
see events happening in the

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.400
early 1930s that horrify
black America.&nbsp; The most

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.800
famous of these cases
was the Scottsboro Boys

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.400
scandal.&nbsp; On
March 25th, 1931,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.200
a white boy comes
off of a train,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.267
passing through Tennessee
and the northern tips of

00:21:10.267 --> 00:21:14.267
Alabama.&nbsp; He comes off the
train with a bloody head and

00:21:14.267 --> 00:21:16.200
claims that there was a
big fight between black and

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.167
white boys on his freight
train that just passed

00:21:18.167 --> 00:21:22.967
through town.&nbsp; A posse
forms.&nbsp; The train is stopped

00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:28.700
at the next station.&nbsp; The
posse looks for and arrests

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.467
the nine black boys who
happen to be on the freight

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:35.300
train.&nbsp; Now what the posse
had not expected--and that

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300
would have been the
end of the story,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.300
if that was all that had
happened.&nbsp; What the posse

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.667
had not expected to
find were two white women,

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.400
Ruby Bates and Victoria
Price.&nbsp; And they were found

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.100
in the same freight car as
some of the black boys.&nbsp; As

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.600
soon as Ruby Bates and
Victoria Price are brought

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.700
out, they see all of the
police and the posse around

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.500
them, and they're
with these black boys,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.100
they immediately size up
the situation and declare

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:10.100
they've been raped.&nbsp; This
changes everything.&nbsp; The

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.500
nine boys are
accused of rape,

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.200
become known as the
Scottsboro Boys.&nbsp; That's

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.000
where the, the court
cases were being held,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.900
in Scottsboro, Alabama.&nbsp;
They range in age from

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:29.700
twenty to thirteen.&nbsp; There
were one or two brother

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.900
pairs, but they
didn't know each other,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.100
essentially.&nbsp; They all
happened to be there.&nbsp; But

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.300
word of the rape
spreads like wildfire,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.167
and the next day, a mob of
two thousand people forms at

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:45.067
the jail where
they'd been kept,

00:22:45.067 --> 00:22:48.400
urging the release
of the Boys so that,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.767
quote, "southern justice"
could be handed out.&nbsp; The

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:55.200
National Guard is called
in immediately to keep them

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.500
safe, which is remarkable
in and of itself.&nbsp; The media

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.800
does not help
matters when it,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.500
when it comes to this
particular case and the fact

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:11.100
that, you know, the word of
this vicious attack starts

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.467
to spread.&nbsp; As they start
the process of sending the

00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:23.200
Boys to trial, the
media, several quotes from

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.000
different newspapers:
"How much farther apart than

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.800
night and day are the nine
men who perpetrated these

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.600
frightful deeds
and a normal,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.100
kind hearted man who guards
his little family and toils

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.100
through the day?"

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.600
Okay, not too offensive.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.500
"We still have
savages abroad in the land,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.267
it seems.&nbsp; Let us have the
solace of knowing that at

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:48.767
least we have risen above
this justice of savages."

00:23:48.767 --> 00:23:49.967
A reference to
the fact that,

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:53.900
that the mob that wanted to
kill the Scottsboro Boys did

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.100
not succeed.&nbsp; So
with an editorial,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.700
giving a collective pat on
the back to folks who did

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.200
not resort to the same kind
of savagery those boys did.&nbsp;

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.900
But then you'd have
editorials like this: "The

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.600
rape was the most atrocious
ever recorded in this part

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.100
of the country, a wholesale
debauching of society,

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.500
so horrible in its details
that all of the facts can

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.700
never be printed.&nbsp; It
savors of the jungle and the

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.967
meanest African corruption."

00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:26.500
This is pre-trial media.&nbsp;
Not very helpful for a

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.700
defense case.&nbsp; At seven A.M.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.500
on the day of
the first trial,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.500
thousands are lined
up, trying to get a seat

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.500
inside.&nbsp; And you--it's
hard--you can't really tell

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.167
from this image, but as the,
the group goes this way,

00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:49.167
you can see it where the
electric lines are cutting

00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:51.300
across, the line
goes beyond the screen,

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.967
beyond the, the actual
image.&nbsp; Thousands are lined

00:24:53.967 --> 00:24:59.267
up hoping to get into the
courthouse to see justice be

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:02.800
enacted.&nbsp; Well, the
boys had no money,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.867
they're dirt poor.&nbsp; They
have a defense attorney

00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:10.000
assigned to them who's
completely incompetent.&nbsp;

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.100
They face an all-white
jury.&nbsp; This is Alabama

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.200
practice.&nbsp; No blacks are
allowed in the jury rolls.&nbsp;

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.867
And, within two weeks,
the boys are indicted,

00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:25.500
tried, and all but one are
sentenced to death.&nbsp; The

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.967
nature of the defense,
the speed of the trial,

00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:32.000
the fact that it was not
a jury of their peers,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.300
angered African Americans
and other parties.&nbsp; One

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.100
party got--was moved
to act very quickly,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.567
and that's a group called
the International Labor

00:25:41.567 --> 00:25:45.200
Defense, the ILD.&nbsp; The
ILD is the legal arm of the

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.967
Communist Party, and the
ILD comes to the Scottsboro

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:53.000
Boys'--Boys'
rescue immediately,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.600
claiming they were given
an inadequate defense,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.667
and all these different
things already cited.&nbsp; "This

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:04.600
was not justice; you need
to have a retrial."&nbsp; Now the

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.367
Communist Party in the USA
has been around since 1919

00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:10.500
or so.&nbsp; It's been reaching
out in sort of tentative

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.100
ways to African
Americans, with,

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.200
with, you know,
middling success really,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.200
increasing but middling.&nbsp;
The NAACP's been around a

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.100
solid decade longer, so one
would presume they're right

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.567
there rushing to
defend them.&nbsp; Well,

00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:29.900
the fact is, no.&nbsp; The NAACP
holds back.&nbsp; It holds back

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.967
for a very important
reason.&nbsp; It did not want to

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.767
tar its own image by
defending possible rapists

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:41.300
and individuals who clearly
did not adhere to the

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.200
NAACP's middle class
ideals.&nbsp; This is really

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.400
important to think about--to
understand about the NAACP.&nbsp;

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.967
It was from its very
founding a middle class

00:26:49.967 --> 00:26:54.600
organization, dedicated to
uplift in legalistic and

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.200
political ways,
assimilationist in its

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.800
ideology,
assimilating to white norms,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.900
white--so-called white
middle class norms.&nbsp; The

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.667
Scottsboro Boys did
not fit that model,

00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:12.367
and the NAACP was afraid of
defending them for fear of a

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:15.200
negative association.&nbsp; The
Communist Party sees this as

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.367
an, an
incredible opportunity,

00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:21.067
as a way to organize African
Americans to become more

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:26.000
sympathetic to the Communist
Party.&nbsp; The Communist Party

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
claimed that defending
the Scottsboro Boys was

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.300
tantamount to fighting
Southern racism and economic

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.700
repression.&nbsp; So the
Communists did not have

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.600
super success with
African Americans,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600
because they were
saying it's all just about

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600
economics.&nbsp; And African
Americans are saying,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.400
"Well, race kind of matters
too in this country."&nbsp; The

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.400
Scottsboro Boys was the, was
the window of opportunity

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.700
for the Communist Party to
broaden the scope of what

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.600
it's going to talk about as
it relates to the African

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.567
American experience.&nbsp; This
transpires and the NAACP's

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:57.900
livid.&nbsp; It wants to be
the organization really

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.467
dedicated to
addressing black concerns,

00:28:00.467 --> 00:28:05.300
and it's very concerned
that the Communist Party is

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.300
involved, because the
radicalism of the Communist

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.600
Party was, was the, was
about the last thing that's

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.467
going to be welcomed in a
politically and socially

00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:19.100
conservative South.&nbsp; So the
NAACP doesn't want to get

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.200
involved because it--it
would be tarnished by these

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.400
Boys' activities, but they
also recognized that with

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.700
the Communist Party
getting involved,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.500
it might be a death, a death
sentence for these Boys,

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:36.500
because no one wants to hear
from the Communists.&nbsp; And

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.700
certainly as the Communists
saw this as a way to open up

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.000
a discussion about
Southern racism,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.300
NAACP thought
that, you know,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.800
"You're, you're pulling too
many things together here,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.167
and trying to--basically
you're trying to develop

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:53.300
racial insubordination in
the South.&nbsp; This is not the

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:58.300
way to go."&nbsp; The Scottsboro
Boys' case because--becomes

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.700
the cause célèbre of the
1930s.&nbsp; All of the issues

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.600
we've talked about in this
course so far are wrapped up

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.867
in this history:
manliness, civilization,

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:09.300
culture, race,
class, power, politics,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.167
and protest, they're all
here.&nbsp; The NAACP wanted more

00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:17.800
than anything else
for a fair trial,

00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:23.300
and began to think,
"Well, maybe we should get

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.167
involved, because we might
be able to win long-term

00:29:26.167 --> 00:29:30.700
advantage for African
Americans by changing the

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.700
way that trials are
organized in the South,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.300
 since there were no
blacks on the jury rolls;

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.200
that might help further
legal challenges and other

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.467
movement opportunities
down the--down the road.

00:29:45.467 --> 00:29:49.600
And the NAACP, you know
on a quick side story,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.700
it knows the
South very well,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.900
far better than
the Communists did,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.767
who were mostly northern and
urban at this point.&nbsp; And

00:29:55.767 --> 00:30:00.067
they reach out, the NAACP
reaches out quietly to try

00:30:00.067 --> 00:30:03.900
to find lawyers for the
Scottsboro Boys who are

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.000
competent.&nbsp; And they talked
to George--Congressman

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.600
George Huddleston, someone
Alabamans considered a fiery

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.967
left-winger.&nbsp; But being
liberal on white issues in

00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:16.900
the South did not
necessarily translate into

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.100
being a liberal on,
quote, "black issues" here.&nbsp;

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.600
Huddleston's response to
the quiet overture from the

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.667
NAACP to support the
Scottsboro Boys' defense,

00:30:25.667 --> 00:30:29.200
and I quote here, "I do
not care whether they are

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.000
innocent or guilty.&nbsp; You
can't understand how we

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.300
Southern gentlemen feel
about this--this question of

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.167
relationship between
Negro men and white women."

00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:43.000
Simply put, the fact
that the Boys were on the

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.700
freight--the same train
as the two white girls was

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.700
enough for Huddleston.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:51.200
He couldn't touch it; it's
toxic.&nbsp; So the very basic

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.700
chronology of the
case is as follows.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.800
In 1931, the Boys were
arrested and convicted.&nbsp; In

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.600
1932, the Supreme Court
overturns their convictions,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.367
saying the Boys lacked
adequate counsel.&nbsp; The fact

00:31:02.367 --> 00:31:03.900
that they're still alive is
really nothing short of a

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.700
miracle, to be honest, and
this is through the ILD's

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.900
efforts.&nbsp; In
1930--in February 1933,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.000
Ruby Bates, one of the two
women who was found on the,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.300
the train, writes a letter
declaring that the boys

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.367
never touched her, that's
it's all made up to protect

00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:26.367
their honor.&nbsp; A month later,
a new trial begins and

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.000
Samuel Leibowitz, an ILD
attorney from New York,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.300
offers new evidence, but is
considered to have been too

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.267
tough on
Victoria Price, the,

00:31:41.267 --> 00:31:42.300
the hold out.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.800
And to her, to her
death, she claimed that this

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.400
was--that she had been
raped.&nbsp; Samuel Leibowitz

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.600
presents new evidence, but
was considered too tough on

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.267
Victoria Price, thus
violating Southern codes of

00:31:55.267 --> 00:31:57.867
honor.&nbsp; After one
day of deliberation,

00:31:57.867 --> 00:32:00.300
Haywood Patterson, one
of the Scottsboro Boys,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.367
is found guilty.&nbsp; The
prosecutor is saying openly,

00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:06.467
"Show them that Alabama
justice cannot be bought and

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:09.867
sold with Jew money from
New York."&nbsp; This is the

00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:13.700
atmosphere of this case.&nbsp;
NAACP blames the I--the

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.500
Communist Party and the
ILD for this conviction and

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.367
that--and at that
point realizes,

00:32:20.367 --> 00:32:22.600
or decides, they have to get
involved if they're going

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.067
to--if there's going to be
any hope of saving the rest

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:29.767
of the boys.&nbsp; By 1935, the
ILD and NAACP are formed

00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:34.400
together in a coalition
to defend the Boys.&nbsp; The

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.100
Communist Party's actions
through all of this gave it

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.000
a new base of intellectual
and political support,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
within Harlem certainly, and
black America in general.&nbsp;

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.967
The Scottsboro Boys'
mothers go on a world tour,

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.567
supported by the
Communist Party,

00:32:51.567 --> 00:32:53.700
to rally support
for their sons,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.900
but also for
workers' plights,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.600
for workers' plights around
the world.&nbsp; And this is

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.967
really--this point is
important.&nbsp; The Communist

00:33:03.967 --> 00:33:07.000
Party makes major inroads
in Harlem in particular,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.800
and you can see
here in this image,

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.300
this is a Scottsboro Boys
rally.&nbsp; And above my hand

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.700
here there's a big
sign, a big poster,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.400
and the words you can make
out there is talking about

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.967
workers, and below it,
Scottsboro Boys.&nbsp; The

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.400
Scottsboro Boys
themselves were,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.200
were vagabonds,
hobos riding the rails,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.267
not uncommon during
this period in time.&nbsp; The

00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:31.400
Communist Party gets
involved and as a way to

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.467
sort of justify its
involvement certainly,

00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:36.967
but also to rally other
people around the cause of

00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:39.700
the Scottsboro Boys, starts
talking about them as,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.300
as workers.&nbsp; "This is what
happens to workers in the

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.200
United States under a
capitalist system."&nbsp; The

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.300
Scottsboro Boys' mothers are
sent on these international

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.000
world tours and they're
coached about how they're

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.100
going to talk about
the worker's plight,

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.100
that the Communist Party
cares about the workers of

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.400
the world, and at the end,
it's a demonstration--it's,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.200
it's proven by the way that
they're advocating on behalf

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.200
of their boys.&nbsp; As we start
to learn more about the

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.900
Scottsboro Boys'
mothers' tour,

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.367
their world tours, we're
discovering the extent to

00:34:14.367 --> 00:34:18.800
which they were--manipulated
is too strong a word--but

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.367
how they were so
highly scripted,

00:34:20.367 --> 00:34:23.000
the mothers that is, in
terms of what they were

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.600
supposed to say and not say
and how they were being sort

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.200
of handled at all times to
make sure they stayed on

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.767
message.&nbsp; Now, be
that as it may,

00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:35.000
whether there was a level
of manipulation here or not,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.467
the fact is the Communist
Party is making incredible

00:34:39.467 --> 00:34:41.700
efforts on behalf of
the Scottsboro Boys,

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.300
and the case is followed
everywhere.&nbsp; And this

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.667
actually--This is actually
another image from Harlem.&nbsp;

00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:50.700
And this--I'm sorry you
can't really make it out

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.667
here, but in a
sense, this is a,

00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:56.100
a, a version now of what
you'd see--what do they call

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.367
those things in
Times Square,

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:02.500
those scrolling messages?&nbsp;
This is an update on the

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.200
trial, when Patterson is
found guilty.&nbsp; And there's a

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.267
commentary written down in
chalk on this blackboard.&nbsp;

00:35:07.267 --> 00:35:12.800
People are gathered
around it to find out what's

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.200
happening with the
Scottsboro Boys.&nbsp; Now what

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.567
happens to them?&nbsp;
They get arrested '31,

00:35:21.567 --> 00:35:28.700
a new case in, in
'32.&nbsp; New cases in '33,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.900
in '33, a coalition in '35.&nbsp;
More hearings were held.&nbsp;

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.800
Half the Boys are released
within a few years of the

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.300
original incident.&nbsp; The
other half languish behind

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.900
bars, and the last one,
the last Scottsboro Boy is

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.900
released, no longer a boy,
in 1950.&nbsp; The Scottsboro

00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:05.300
Boys' cause became the focal
point of rallies across the

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.700
country, in Harlem,
as these images show,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.067
black college campuses.&nbsp;
The Scottsboro Boys' cause

00:36:14.067 --> 00:36:16.100
became the sites of
numerous political protests,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.100
and it really speaks to the
new era or new philosophy

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.800
about black politics during
this era.&nbsp; These rallies are

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.300
not the rallies of Garvey's
Back to Africa dreams.&nbsp;

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.067
They're not the
silent protest marches,

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:34.300
protesting against
lynchings.&nbsp; The Scottsboro

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.267
Boys' rallies, although they
are rich in symbolism about

00:36:37.267 --> 00:36:39.267
the black--the black
Boys being workers,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.900
they also start to change
political affiliations and

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.567
movements on the ground.&nbsp;
The Scottsboro Boys' rallies

00:36:53.567 --> 00:37:00.067
are, in so many ways,
explicitly political.&nbsp; And

00:37:00.067 --> 00:37:01.700
these rallies, in this
way, are new to the,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.500
to the scene as far--far
as black Americans were

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.400
concerned.&nbsp; And we'll see
how this is articulated in

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.667
movement politics in--in
our next lecture.&nbsp; So taking

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:15.000
together the Black Cabinet
and the Scottsboro Boys'

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.667
case, represent two sides of
new political possibilities

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:23.000
and new forms of political
expression within black

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
America: high politics and,
for lack of a better phrase,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.800
the low politics, but
also becoming topics of

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.400
international conversation
in terms of the black

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:41.367
political situation.&nbsp; It's
a time of change.&nbsp; Oh one

00:37:41.367 --> 00:37:44.500
image here I forgot, before
I tell a quick story.&nbsp; This

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.267
is a poster.&nbsp; I mean the
Scottsboro Boys went on

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:47.267
tour.

00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:51.300
In 1937, Willie Robinson and
Eugene Williams came to New

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.200
Haven to tell of the
"horrors of hell and the

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.767
pleasures of heaven."&nbsp; They
came to the Emanuel Baptist

00:37:56.767 --> 00:37:59.500
Church to talk about
their experiences in,

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.100
in, Scotts--in the, in this
case.&nbsp; It's a local story in

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.500
this way, but it's part
of a larger international

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.000
phenomenon.&nbsp; Now I want to
switch gears quickly from

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
the Black Cabinet and the
Scottsboro Boys to talk of

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.667
the New Negro Alliance.&nbsp; And
I've got six minutes to tell

00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:19.800
what I used to
do in a lecture,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.567
so hang on.&nbsp; The New
Negro Alliance is a local

00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:26.667
articulation--this is
local being Washington,

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:30.200
D.C.--of a larger
national phenomenon,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.700
"Don't buy where you can't
work" campaigns.&nbsp; "Don't buy

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:37.600
where you can't work"
campaigns.&nbsp; And it speaks to

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.400
this new sort of form of
political organizing that

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.267
I'm suggesting is there with
the Scottsboro Boys and the,

00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:45.600
the Black Cabinet.&nbsp; So I've
seen certain ways the New

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.500
Negro Alliance pulling
together embodying this new

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.500
political philosophy.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.767
That's why I want to tell
this story very quickly.

00:38:53.767 --> 00:38:56.800
So there are these campaigns
across the country where

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.300
black--blacks would
organize and say,

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:07.000
"We're not going to buy
at the local thrift store,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.200
because they won't employ
black workers in this black

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.167
neighborhood.&nbsp; In
August of 1933,

00:39:12.167 --> 00:39:13.700
this philosophy, this
political movement,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.267
lands in D.C.

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:17.700
where the owner of the local
hamburger stand in black

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.200
Washington, in, in the
area, U Street district near

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.467
Howard--Howard University,
sort of the major black

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:28.000
shopping enclave in the
city.&nbsp; When the the guy who

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.300
owns the hamburger grill
fires the two black workers

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.600
he has and hires two
white kids in his place,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.300
wants to give them
jobs.&nbsp; You know,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.000
everybody's desperate for
jobs since it's the Great

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.067
Depression.&nbsp; Within hours, a
picket line's formed at the

00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:43.167
hamburger stand, in the
spirit of "Don't buy where

00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.100
you can't work."&nbsp; "We're not
going to patronize the store

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.067
anymore, because they
won't let our type,

00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:52.000
our folks, black folks, work
in this place."&nbsp; And this is

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.100
a white-owned store, if
that part wasn't clear.&nbsp; It

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.100
should have been.&nbsp;
Next thing you know,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.400
an--a group is organized.&nbsp;
Two or three young men in

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.767
college, just
heading out of college,

00:40:06.767 --> 00:40:09.267
called the New Negro
Alliance.&nbsp; One of these

00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:11.400
"Don't buy where you
can't work" campaigns,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.967
and the city
becomes electrified,

00:40:12.967 --> 00:40:15.267
black
Wash--Washington that is,

00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:17.367
as New Negro--New Negro
Alliance starts holding

00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:21.567
rallies, putting up
posters.&nbsp; This is about

00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:24.700
staying out of People's
drugstores.&nbsp; You know,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.200
"They won't employ
blacks in the store,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.100
we're not going to shop
there any longer."&nbsp; To all

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.700
fine--to all
fair-minded people,

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.100
justice is, is essential to
Americanism.&nbsp; People's is

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.200
not just being
racist; they're being

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:44.667
anti-American.&nbsp; Other
pair--posters would go up,

00:40:44.667 --> 00:40:47.800
fliers, again, about
People's Drugstore.&nbsp; "Don't

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.167
cheat on your race.&nbsp;
Stay out of all People's

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:52.500
Drugstores."&nbsp; And so
equating People's Drugstores

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:59.900
to an overseer whipping a
poor black laborer.&nbsp; Now

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.800
this is sort of the
angry political art of a,

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.200
you know,
college-age students.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.967
You know how you guys are.&nbsp;
But the New Negro Alliance

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:10.767
really became remarkable for
the way that it brought in

00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:12.600
all these
different sectors of,

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.200
of black Washington.&nbsp; The
most respectable members of

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.000
Washington start joining
picket lines.&nbsp; "People's is

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.167
unfair, no colored clerks in
colored neighborhoods.&nbsp; Stay

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:29.867
out."&nbsp; In short order, the
New Negro Alliance starts

00:41:29.867 --> 00:41:34.600
getting success after
success.&nbsp; The local dairy,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.100
People's
Drugstore, the cigar shop,

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.400
all these places start
to hire black workers,

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.567
but there's a hold out.&nbsp;
The hold out is the Sanitary

00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:48.367
Grocery Company.&nbsp; The
Sanitary Grocery Company is

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:51.000
the most important
grocer in Washington,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.900
D.C., during the era.&nbsp; It's
in black neighborhoods and

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.267
white neighborhoods.&nbsp;
Sanitary Grocery employed

00:41:58.267 --> 00:42:02.600
black workers, but as
back office workers,

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.500
stockroom boys, or
janitors.&nbsp; These were the

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.967
lowest paying jobs in the
store and they were also the

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:13.600
invisible jobs.&nbsp; New Negro
Alliance comes up to them

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.167
and says, you know, "The
best paying jobs in your

00:42:15.167 --> 00:42:17.267
store, aside from
being managers,

00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:20.200
are the cash register
clerks.&nbsp; Why don't you have

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.767
any blacks in those
positions?"&nbsp; Sanitary

00:42:23.767 --> 00:42:25.067
Grocery gave
its explanation,

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:28.600
gave its reasons, and the
New Negro Alliance puts up

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.800
picket lines like this one.&nbsp;
This is just one person,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.500
but starts putting up
picket lines around Sanitary

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.667
Grocery.&nbsp; Sanitary Grocery
is not going to fold like

00:42:36.667 --> 00:42:39.900
these other places fold, and
so starts its own political

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.967
campaign with photographs
of all the black workers,

00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:45.367
you know, dressed
in nice uniforms,

00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:47.200
smiling for the
camera.&nbsp; You know,

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.800
"Sanitary Grocery
works--you know,

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.100
we work for
Sanitary Grocery,

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.067
support Sanitary Grocery."&nbsp;
So they're trading fliers,

00:42:54.067 --> 00:43:02.000
pamphlets, media bout--you
know media shots for a--for

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.900
a long time.&nbsp; It starts
becoming a legal case.&nbsp; The

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.667
New Negro Alliance activists
reach out to Howard

00:43:11.667 --> 00:43:15.567
University Law School.&nbsp; This
is a pre--pro--prologue to

00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:17.900
the lecture next week.&nbsp;
They reach out to Howard

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.000
University Law School,
and says to the law school

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.767
students, "We need help
organizing a court case

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:28.700
here."&nbsp; And they start
getting legal counsel from

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.900
some of the law students and
some of the law professors.&nbsp;

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.500
Because it's in D.C., a
court case can become a

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:39.100
Supreme Court case very
quickly.&nbsp; The le--the

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.400
issue--the legal issue,
Sanitary Grocery Company is

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.067
saying, "You cannot picket
in front of our store.&nbsp;

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:46.500
You're not an employee."&nbsp;
Just like this minister is

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.900
picketing in front of
People's.&nbsp; He didn't work at

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.300
People's.&nbsp; Sanitary Grocery
is go--Sanitary Grocery is

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.100
saying, "If you don't--if
you aren't an employee of

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.400
the company, you aren't
allowed to picket."&nbsp; New

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.400
Negro Alliance said, "This
is a free speech issue.&nbsp; We

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:04.300
can picket."&nbsp; And it becomes
a Supreme Court case.&nbsp; And

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.200
in 1938, aided by the
attorneys at--the attorneys

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.300
in training and the, the
faculty at the law school at

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:15.100
Howard, the Supreme Court
offers a decision in The New

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.200
Negro Alliance versus
Sanitary Grocery Company.&nbsp;

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.000
And in that decision, it
says that it's protected

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
speech, picketing that
is.&nbsp; As long as you're not

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.100
interfering with the
business at hand in terms of

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.200
blocking the
entrance, let's say,

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.200
it's protected
speech.&nbsp; And as such,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.367
these rallies, these--the
work of the New Negro

00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:37.667
Alliance, is perfectly
constitutional.&nbsp; It's a

00:44:37.667 --> 00:44:39.100
major boost to
the labor movement,

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:45.800
as it happens, and it really
makes great changes for the

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.200
New Negro
Alliance.&nbsp; It further,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.967
you know,
underscores its importance.

00:44:49.967 --> 00:44:52.900
It also tells a really
interesting story at the

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.200
end.&nbsp; There's a coda that I
think is really humorous,

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.800
but tells you something
about the way these things

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.800
operate.&nbsp; Sanitary
Grocery Company was the most

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.767
important
grocer in the city,

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.600
and the last thing it
wanted or needed was to be

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.000
affiliated with a Supreme
Court case that it lost,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.300
especially losing to African
Americans.&nbsp; So the Sanitary

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.500
Grocery Company ceases doing
business under that name,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:21.367
and it becomes Safeway.&nbsp; For
those of you who know about

00:45:21.367 --> 00:45:23.000
Safeway, yes.&nbsp; I mean
Safeways are actually

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.700
disappearing now, because
they're being bought up by

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.100
other conglomerates,
but Safeway's a major

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.000
chain--well, last I knew,
still a major chain in--in

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.267
California.&nbsp; And
they're still in the D.C.

00:45:33.267 --> 00:45:36.367
area, although they
are slowly going away,

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:37.867
being bought up by,
last time I checked,

00:45:37.867 --> 00:45:38.967
which is a
couple of years ago,

00:45:38.967 --> 00:45:43.000
it was--it was owned by the
parent company of--that also

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.600
owned Vond's,
Pavilion's, Dominic's,

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.267
Carr's,
Randall's, Tom Thumb's,

00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:49.500
Grocery Works.&nbsp; I
think it's a big Canadian

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.600
conglomerate.&nbsp; But this is,
I mean it's a humorous coda

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.867
for those who know Safeway.&nbsp;
There's no mention anywhere

00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.600
of Safeway's
history, corporate history,

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.500
of this actual--actually
happening.&nbsp; Corporations

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.200
don't want to
be tainted with,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.400
well, lack of success or
really bad news.&nbsp; And in the

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.400
case of the "Don't buy where
you can't work" campaign in

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.967
Washington, D.C., they
had both.&nbsp; And so Sanitary

00:46:10.967 --> 00:46:13.500
Grocery Company ceased to
exist.&nbsp; It started operating

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.700
under a new name.&nbsp; This is
the potential of the new

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.400
black politics:
high politics,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.100
low politics, somewhere
in the middle politics,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.600
and you're going to start
seeing in tomorrow's lecture

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.267
and in the, in the lectures
over the next couple of

00:46:26.267 --> 00:46:30.500
weeks, a new kind of
organizing mentality,

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.000
operating at all levels,
that starts to change the

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.767
landscape of the American
scene.&nbsp; Thanks so much.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.078
Prof: You remember,
when I was talking about

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:12.024
Europe, we discussed the fact
that during marriage Europeans

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:15.458
just had babies,
in a sense willy-nilly,

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:19.344
but we also said it was nowhere
near the maximum that humans are

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.199
capable of,
but we thought it was sort of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.826
cultural constraints,
late marriage,

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:26.470
and stuff like that.
 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.547
Now we come to China in which
the birth rate within marriage

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:34.210
was quite a bit lower and I
introduced the question of

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.943
whether this was voluntary in
the sense of individually

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:40.389
decided,
an individual decides what they

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:43.606
want and acts on it,
or was this low birth rate due

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:48.040
to cultural constraints in a
crowded household with maybe the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.700
grandmother sleeping beneath
you.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.467
There's no opportunity,
if the cultural rules say you

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:56.541
can't be friends with your wife,
there may be a reduction in

00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.031
passion,
and the conclusion that I gave

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.250
you was that this didn't seem to
be an individual decision kind

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.040
of thing but a cultural kind of
thing.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.760
It's a little bit out of place
but I just can't--

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.082
I love this data so much,
it's so very striking as an

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:16.534
example of people that are not
individually voluntarily

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.580
controlling their fertility.
 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.159
How would you tell if someone
is?

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.025
--You have a big huge
population, you can't interview

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.352
all of them,
maybe it's a dead population,

00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:32.397
old, how do you tell whether
they're making individual

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:33.390
decisions?
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.120
Well you have--one of the ways
of doing it is to consider

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.519
individual events in their lives
that you think,

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.580
under any reasonable idea of
what it is to be a human,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.700
would affect their fertility.
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.260
One of those events is the
death of a child.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.510
There's many--I mean I think
you all would naturally say,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.078
if you want a certain number of
children you're going to control

00:01:56.078 --> 00:01:57.830
consciously--
if your children die,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.109
you're going to try harder to
have more,

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.700
you're going to try longer.
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.039
Here is a Chinese population
from 1982, so we're talking

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.008
about just at the time when the
one child policy is starting.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.084
These are women who have
finished their childbearing by

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:19.460
1982, so it's the generation
exactly prior to the one-child

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.288
policy.
 

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:23.900
It gives you a lot of data but
look over here,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.598
it says what happened to the
first four children,

00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:30.432
and it gives you two cases:
all the children died or all

00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:31.199
survived.
 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.484
There's a lot of intermediate
cases which are not shown in

00:02:34.484 --> 00:02:37.941
this particular graph and it's
spread out by age to seeing if

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:39.900
there some sort of age effect.
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.138
Here is the mother's age at
last birth, so if all of them

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:48.754
survived--if all of them died
you would think the mother would

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:50.949
really want to have more.
 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.960
She stops giving birth at age
38.7.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.378
If they all survived,
1/10th of a year,

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:02.610
she stops giving birth 1/10th
of a year earlier,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.590
one month earlier.
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.495
Same, a little bit older group
you have 0.4 year,

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:15.116
maybe four months later,
and here's 0.1 months again for

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:19.919
women who are 20--their age at
first birth.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.686
I'm sorry; the age at which
they stop depends on the age at

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:26.090
which they start to a large
degree.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.289
The numbers of this way are
different because they started

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.026
at different ages,
but there's no difference

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:35.884
within an age group depending on
whether all four children died

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:37.940
or all four children survived.
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.394
That's just--to me that's an
amazing set of statistics that

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:47.942
apparently the continuation,
the attempt to have as many

00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:51.389
children as possible just does
not depend on that event.

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.538
Here's another example of this,
this is--

00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:58.610
as was discussed in most of
Asia, a lot of the world,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.169
and especially China,
they need males,

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.110
sons are much preferred over
daughters.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.137
Here's a very nicely displayed
set of data saying how many sons

00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:13.538
have you had,
how many daughters?

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:18.334
Here's--that have had no son or
no daughter, and the question is

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.389
how many of them proceed?
 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.259
These numbers show the fraction
that proceeds to have the first

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:24.759
birth.
 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.591
When they get married and they
have no children,

00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:35.761
neither a son nor a daughter
0.958--I'm sorry they have a son

00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.483
first;
they have one son or one

00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:39.190
daughter.
 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.132
Those that have a son 95.8% of
them proceed to have a second

00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:48.069
child and that can be either a
boy or a girl.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.519
If their first child is a
daughter 96.8% proceed,

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.735
so you don't have to look up
here and the details aren't

00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:58.810
important,
but look at for instance those

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.706
that have seven sons in a row,
and 72%, 72.5% of them proceed

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.910
to get pregnant again.
 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.810
Here's seven daughters in a
row, they want the sons,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.564
and they may not want
daughters, 76%,

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:19.158
a 3.5% difference,
almost no difference in their

00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:20.000
life.
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.319
Again, how many of them,
after having seven sons,

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.017
you presume that's enough sons,
whereas seven daughters they

00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:30.778
would be desperate to have more
but there's a very small--

00:05:30.778 --> 00:05:35.800
a 3% difference between the
fraction of them that proceed.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.720
You can also see the numbers
are very high;

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.279
those that have had seven
children already,

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.329
76% proceed to have another
birth.

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:47.314
They just keep going,
and whether they have all

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:49.908
daughters in a row,
or all sons in a row,

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:52.050
makes very little difference.
 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.199
Finally at eight there is--it
is a 10%--

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.576
less than, yes,
a 10% difference,

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.406
but whether that's--
that doesn't fit with the rest

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:03.439
of the graph but it's still very
small difference.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.259
Here's the last graph of this
nature.

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.447
This is again the age at the
mother's last birth,

00:06:11.447 --> 00:06:14.170
and again, it's the same kind
of graph.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.629
Those that have had eight
daughters in a row versus those

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.459
that have eight sons in a row,
and you think,

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:23.583
in a son desiring culture,
if they were controlling their

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.589
fertility in any individualistic
way,

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.600
that the ones with a lot of
sons would say,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.487
okay enough and the ones with a
lot of daughters would be

00:06:31.487 --> 00:06:33.240
desperate to finally have a son.
 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.476
Look at the difference,
the age of 41.4,

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:40.545
if they have eight sons in a
row and the age 41.7,

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:42.870
again 3/10ths of a year.
 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:49.040
They try just a little bit
longer, three months longer.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.509
Basically I think what this
data is telling you is that

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.149
people are,
for sure, not responding to the

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.440
most important fertility events
in their life,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.245
either the sex composition of
their children or the death of

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:04.740
the children;
they're just having children.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.786
Not at an enormous rate because
of the cultural things that

00:07:10.786 --> 00:07:16.312
everybody is behaving under,
not with respect to their

00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:20.379
individual experiences and
desires.

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:24.370
This is the context into which
the one-child--

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.120
first the Wan,
Xi, Shao, the later,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.798
longer, fewer policy drops in
and then ten years later the

00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:33.593
one-child policy,
so it gives you an

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:36.673
amazing--here's a population
that's just finished

00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:40.521
childbearing when the policy
starts and there's apparently no

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:43.408
thought whatsoever of
individually controlling

00:07:43.408 --> 00:07:44.500
fertility.
 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.889
All of a sudden the government
tells you,

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.879
hey you got to have fewer
children,

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:55.077
and I showed you the rate of
fall, the rate of fall during

00:07:55.077 --> 00:07:57.360
the 1970s was just fantastic.
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.235
Then after that fall,
again as I told you last time,

00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:04.958
to control momentum,
they instituted the one-child

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.528
policy and the number of births
levels off.

00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:11.610
Why does the number of births
level off?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.165
This is again the fertility
drop, this is the longer,

00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:21.069
later, fewer policy in the
1970s and that's where you get

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:24.242
the big drop;
1980 the one-child policy,

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:26.379
you don't get any further
drops.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:32.761
That was a sign of--well,
an incompetent government,

00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:38.769
an incompetently carried out
fertility policy.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.907
It turns out that one arm of
the government was doing

00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:45.105
something to the opposite effect
of another arm of the

00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:46.009
government.
 

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:52.929
Here the Chinese were--for
women's rights issues and to

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:55.082
control--
somewhat control the

00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:56.980
population--they were
encouraging later marriage,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.210
they didn't want girls married
at 13,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.798
14,15 and so forth.
 

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:03.639
It had been very successful,
the revolution is out here,

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:08.255
and the age of marriage is
already up to 19.5 or so by 1965

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:11.996
and they're being very
successful and the age of

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:17.490
marriage keeps going up until it
reaches a quite respectable 23,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.259
that's older than basically all
of you are--

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:21.529
most of you, not all of you.
 

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:24.168
It reaches a peak there.
 

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:25.288
Then what does the government
do?

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:29.325
It says well we're doing great,
we're now very worried,

00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:33.734
this is the year where they
introduced the one-child policy,

00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:36.350
we want this to continue on up.
 

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.245
They don't have good
demographic statistics and they

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.063
don't know this data,
they don't actually know what

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:43.970
age people are actually marrying
at,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.875
so they have an official age
which was actually above this

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:54.104
and they--
I'm sorry, they raised that age

00:09:54.104 --> 00:09:59.591
to prevent more marriages but
since people were below that

00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:02.552
what happened was--
let's see I'm getting this

00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:02.908
backwards.
 

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:06.352
They--anyway the result of a
policy they had an opposite

00:10:06.352 --> 00:10:08.817
result,
that the result of instituting

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:12.490
a new policy intending to raise
marriage age reduced marriage

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.408
age instead.
 

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:16.567
Then you see when they
introduce the one-child policy

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:19.966
the mean age of marriage goes
down and it goes down quite

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:21.058
significantly.
 

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:25.594
The one-child policy saying you
should have fewer children is

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:30.052
working oppositely to a new
policy that actually reduces the

00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:33.000
age at marriage and increases
the .

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.991
The result is,
this is the number of new

00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:38.586
marriages,
first marriages,

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:42.884
and there's a rise here,
then there's kind of dipsy

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:45.184
doodles,
and then, just at the time of

00:10:45.184 --> 00:10:48.172
the one-child policy,
the number of new marriages

00:10:48.172 --> 00:10:48.918
goes crazy.
 

00:10:48.918 --> 00:10:52.990
This big rise in the number of
marriages,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.798
and remember 98% of Chinese
women, when the get married,

00:10:55.798 --> 00:10:57.851
get pregnant right away,
so the next year they had

00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:00.878
babies,
this counteracts basically all

00:11:00.878 --> 00:11:04.269
of the effect of the one-child
policy.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:07.994
That's one branch of government
making one set of laws,

00:11:07.994 --> 00:11:11.580
not having the data and not
being in accord with what

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.269
another set of government is
doing.

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:17.976
In fact the one-child policy--I
don't want to leave you with

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:21.557
impression that the one-child
policy had no effect but you

00:11:21.557 --> 00:11:23.820
have to do different statistics.
 

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.508
Remember the total fertility
rate takes all the women that

00:11:28.508 --> 00:11:31.639
are in an age group,
whether they're married or not,

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.320
and ask how many children
they're having.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.559
Well when you have a big change
in the fraction of women married

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.590
then you have to use a different
statistic.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.804
When the age of marriage
changes, as it did in China at

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.230
that time,
you have to now look at a new

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.532
statistic called the parity
progression ratio which is very

00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:52.548
much like those triangle graphs
that I showed you.

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:59.469
This says--this black line is
how many proceed from having no

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:05.346
children to having one child,
so the fraction of women--and

00:12:05.346 --> 00:12:08.288
this is in the 95% range or
something.

00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.331
Basically all the Chinese
women, at this time when they

00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:13.980
get married, give birth to their
first child.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.571
Now the next number is those
that already have one child,

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.970
what fraction of them proceed
to have two children?

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.817
The answer is,
before this policy,

00:12:24.817 --> 00:12:30.380
even more than the one,
98% of women that already have

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.020
one child proceed to have a
second child and that may be

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.293
that in this group are fairly--
are sterile women or sterile

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:41.950
men and so that may be the
difference between here,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.389
but we don't have that data.
 

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:46.173
Again, this is very,
very high and then the other

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:49.710
numbers, those that have two
children how many go to three?

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.221
Those that have three children
how many go to four or more and

00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:55.870
so forth and we don't have data
before this.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.908
You can see that the first
child is uninterrupted;

00:12:59.908 --> 00:13:01.952
the Wan, Xi,
Shao, the later,

00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:05.820
longer, fewer policy and the
one-child policy does not

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.009
interrupt the first birth.
 

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:11.149
That goes on as normal which is
what is expected,

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:14.570
but going to a second child now
at the time of the introduction

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:20.784
of the one-child policy,
this crashes as does later

00:13:20.784 --> 00:13:22.240
births.
 

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.245
The one-child policy did have
an effect if you look at those

00:13:28.245 --> 00:13:32.068
already married,
but the two different policies,

00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:35.360
one lowering the age of
marriage counteracts the effect

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.200
and for a number of years the
fertility rate stays constant.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.070
We've just had some visitors,
let me show what I was talking

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.460
about.
 

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.639
This is the birthrate in China,
what's called the total

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.741
fertility rate,
and here is 1970 when the

00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:52.337
later, longer,
fewer policy was introduced and

00:13:52.337 --> 00:13:56.546
it was the decade of the 1970s
where the fertility rate in

00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:57.580
China fell.
 

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.966
In 1979/1980 the one-child
policy is introduced and for

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:06.110
about a decade or so the
birthrate does not decrease

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.330
under that.
 

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:14.528
We have some guests apparently.
 

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:18.149
What was happening was that in
the cities,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.932
as I mentioned,
there was a very significant

00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:24.274
birth drop in the 1960s,
even before the government

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:26.638
was--then in the 1970s,
during Wan, Xi,

00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:30.120
Shao, the city populations went
down to below fertility level.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.097
In the countryside's,
even though there was a big

00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:38.077
drop in the 1970s,
it wasn't anything like it was

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.570
in the cities.
 

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.182
As you heard from Qing who
talked about her family's

00:14:44.182 --> 00:14:46.785
experience,
in the cities there were many

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.629
people that worked for the
government,

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.480
and so were under tight
government control.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.785
Many of them worked in
government owned factories so

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.548
were under tight government
control,

00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:58.316
and in general,
in cities there is much more

00:14:58.316 --> 00:15:01.120
ability to control the people.
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.899
However, at that time,
80% of Chinese people lived in

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:05.700
villages.
 

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.000
It was still a very rural
country and there the story is

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.940
different.
 

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.899
Among other things,
in many villages,

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:15.730
all the people are related,
they're all relatives.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.304
So, the professor who's got the
next lab to mine is named Zhong

00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:22.476
and in his village everybody is
a Zhong, and they're all

00:15:22.476 --> 00:15:23.168
related.
 

00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:27.798
If people don't believe in a
policy,

00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:30.091
they don't want to obey the
government and everybody is

00:15:30.091 --> 00:15:33.029
related,
your uncle second removed can't

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:37.330
really enforce a policy on you
if you're a relative,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.394
especially in a culture where
kinship means so much and the

00:15:41.394 --> 00:15:44.690
relationship between relatives
means so much.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:52.660
The one-child policy was much,
much less successful in the

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.620
countryside.
 

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.022
Similarly, the cities were
beginning to have excess jobs

00:15:58.022 --> 00:16:01.240
and people were streaming out of
the countryside,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.870
also because of the population
growth there was no land left,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.024
so they were streaming out of
the countryside going into the

00:16:06.024 --> 00:16:09.335
cities,
they didn't have legal living

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:10.250
permits.
 

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.796
They have a system where you
document where you live and you

00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:15.472
have to stay there and they were
not allowed officially to come

00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:17.830
into the cities,
but of course they did,

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.107
and so the government didn't
know where they were and

00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:24.890
basically had no control over
them and so they were very hard

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.899
to control.
 

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:34.509
Even though among--Then another
thing that happens,

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:40.298
again just at this time,
is that previously everybody--

00:16:40.298 --> 00:16:42.774
the peasants had been in
communes and I talked about them

00:16:42.774 --> 00:16:45.419
last time,
several thousand families in

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:47.482
one big farm,
and under again,

00:16:47.482 --> 00:16:49.509
strict control of the
government.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.663
Then with the Great Leap
Forward they realized the

00:16:52.663 --> 00:16:56.136
commune system has failed and
the land goes back to the

00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:58.839
people,
they break up the communes and

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:01.090
people get their own plot of
land.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.343
They don't own it in our sense
but they have the rights to work

00:17:04.343 --> 00:17:05.548
on that plot of land.
 

00:17:05.548 --> 00:17:08.902
Well they started growing their
own food, private markets for

00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.305
food grow up,
and the people are not getting

00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:13.818
everything they need from the
government.

00:17:13.818 --> 00:17:16.777
If they really oppose some
government policy then they can

00:17:16.777 --> 00:17:20.150
tell the government 'bye-bye,' I
don't need anything from you,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.818
I'm now an independent farmer
and I'll do what I want.

00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:29.692
The change to a market economy,
that changed to more economic

00:17:29.692 --> 00:17:34.141
freedom for the individuals,
led to all kinds of personal

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:38.279
freedom and led to the ability
to say no to the government.

00:17:43.358 --> 00:17:44.694
At the time,
in the press,

00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:47.740
there were all kinds of
examples of what was going on,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.910
and for instance here's one
article from 1980 again--

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.578
I'm sorry this is 2000.
 

00:17:55.578 --> 00:17:58.832
The one-child policy has been
in effect for 20 years,

00:17:58.832 --> 00:18:02.271
"No one can accuse Huo
Suifa of not knowing what he

00:18:02.271 --> 00:18:02.960
wanted.
 

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.259
The 47-year-old farmer dreamed
of having a son.

00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:11.630
After seven daughters he
finally got a male heir in 1989.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.463
Ho named him Gaifeng,
or 'change-in-the-weather,' and

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:18.192
then he stopped having
children,"

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:22.055
so seven daughters and a son,
so this person--most--almost

00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:24.960
all of that time must have been
under the one-child policy;

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.130
eight children.
 

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.505
He says, "It wasn't easy
to have all these children,

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:32.374
but it wasn't hard
either,"

00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:33.578
the farmer said.
 

00:18:33.578 --> 00:18:35.368
"If things became tough in
our village,

00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.403
if there was a campaign to
enforce the rule in their

00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:40.902
village"
and China has these political

00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:44.055
campaigns to get people to
change their behavior quite

00:18:44.055 --> 00:18:47.211
routinely at this time,
"Well my wife just went to

00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:49.068
another township to have the
child."

00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:53.334
What's the other side of the
coin is this Huo now has a wife

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:57.960
and eight children to support,
and how much land does he have?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.598
One-third of an acre for eight,
nine, ten people;

00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:08.344
this is not a good economic
system, exactly why the

00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:11.568
one-child policy was instituted.
 

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.140
An American misconception,
fed by our press,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.009
is that China's government is
very monolithic.

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:20.903
The chairman in Peking or some
bureaucrat says this is the

00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:23.088
rule, this is law,
spells it out,

00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:25.480
everybody has to obey this law.
 

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.056
Isn't the case;
there's whole books now on how

00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:33.403
China is actually ruled,
and the story is that the

00:19:33.403 --> 00:19:35.338
government almost gives a
slogan,

00:19:35.338 --> 00:19:37.924
it's a one-child policy,
or they sometimes call it the

00:19:37.924 --> 00:19:41.483
only child policy,
is not a set of rules it's kind

00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:43.118
of almost a slogan.
 

00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:46.413
Then it goes down to the
provinces, and each province has

00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:49.885
to determine in accord with
local conditions as which is the

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:51.710
official way of stating it.
 

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.989
Then each province gives it
down to the prefectures and the

00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:55.834
same thing,
it's interpreted by

00:19:55.834 --> 00:19:59.718
local--under local conditions
and then it goes down to the

00:19:59.718 --> 00:20:02.578
villages where it's completely
changed.

00:20:02.578 --> 00:20:07.001
There's no--absolutely no
uniformity from village to

00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:07.868
village.
 

00:20:07.868 --> 00:20:12.808
What that resulted in was the
policy was never able to be

00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:15.720
consistently put into practice.
 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.690
The statistics give you the
answer to that.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.226
The total fertility rate during
this initial period of

00:20:23.226 --> 00:20:27.230
enforcement of the one-child
policy never fell below two,

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.288
so the policy was one child,
but it never fell below two

00:20:31.288 --> 00:20:32.098
children.
 

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:37.048
In the rural areas it never
fell below 2.5.

00:20:37.048 --> 00:20:39.930
As you saw a couple of lectures
ago,

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.266
Qing showed you the one child
certificate where the couple

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:45.929
promises,
it's just a promise,

00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:47.838
this doesn't say you've done it
and this is just--

00:20:47.838 --> 00:20:49.990
even to promise that you're
only going to have one child,

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:55.500
and less than 20% of married
couples ever signed onto even

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.980
that promise of having one
child,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.828
which was telling the
government, no we're not going

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:03.450
to comply with this policy.
 

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.150
Throughout the 1980s,
which again was when the policy

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.087
was strictly enforced,
nearly half of all the births

00:21:11.087 --> 00:21:15.088
were second,
third, or higher order births.

00:21:15.088 --> 00:21:17.914
Eighty percent of China's
children had brothers or

00:21:17.914 --> 00:21:22.247
sisters,
or both, many had both and only

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:28.807
1/5th of the 300 million
children under age 14 were from

00:21:28.807 --> 00:21:31.788
single child families.
 

00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:39.940
In 1986, again after the
first--Question?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.208
Student:  Would you say
this is a result of inconsistent

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:46.265
applications of the one-child
policy or a reflection of the

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:49.480
fact that the one-child policy
was never (inaudible) one child

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.220
and not in that urban area?
 

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.698
Prof: Both,
at this time initially it was

00:21:53.698 --> 00:21:56.808
supposed to be one child for all
except minority people,

00:21:56.808 --> 00:21:59.608
so a very small part of the
population.

00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:02.008
I'll tell you in a minute
that--because of popular

00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:04.259
resistance they immediately
loosened it up,

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:09.289
so the main thing which you're
probably referring to is that

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:14.055
rather soon they said peasants--
the city people had already had

00:22:14.055 --> 00:22:15.380
their fertility drop.
 

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.883
Many of them were not very
interested in having more than

00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:18.420
one child.
 

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.940
It was not a huge issue for you;
one of your readings discusses

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.410
that.
 

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.588
In the countryside the peasants
still wanted,

00:22:25.588 --> 00:22:27.692
certainly a son,
more children,

00:22:27.692 --> 00:22:31.828
so the policy was changed
rather rapidly so that if you--

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:35.295
if your first child is a
daughter you can have another

00:22:35.295 --> 00:22:38.403
one and try for a boy,
but two is the limit and of

00:22:38.403 --> 00:22:44.547
course two was not--
even that was not always

00:22:44.547 --> 00:22:46.630
observed.
 

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.095
Remember I told you last time
that the goal when the Chinese

00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:56.671
population crossed a billion,
or looked like it was very

00:22:56.671 --> 00:23:00.242
close to crossing a billion,
and the government sort of

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:04.265
desperately wanted to keep the
population below 1.2 billion in

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:06.769
the year 2000 they didn't make
it,

00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:09.150
the population was 1.3 billion.
 

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.702
They missed by a 100 million
and now it's considerably over

00:23:13.702 --> 00:23:17.078
that and the population is still
growing.

00:23:17.078 --> 00:23:21.268
Because of population momentum,
again the age structure of

00:23:21.268 --> 00:23:24.672
China,
China's population is expected

00:23:24.672 --> 00:23:29.058
to grow by another 150 million
people by 2025,

00:23:29.058 --> 00:23:32.336
so even though they've worked
so hard and suffered so much

00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:35.440
under these various policies to
restrict fertility,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.318
they're still going to increase
from now,

00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:42.404
from 2008 to 2025 by half the
total population of the United

00:23:42.404 --> 00:23:43.180
States.
 

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.358
Again, comparable to a
calculation I gave earlier,

00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:53.490
Hu Jintao, who was president of
China recently says,

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.057
the party plans to quadruple
economic output per capita in

00:23:58.057 --> 00:23:59.019
that time.
 

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:01.440
This was before the economic
crash that has just happened.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.807
He wanted to quadruple the per
capita income,

00:24:04.807 --> 00:24:09.401
which would still bring China
up only to a low European level

00:24:09.401 --> 00:24:10.318
perhaps.
 

00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:16.500
With a 1.3 billion population,
and you're quadrupling it,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.413
that's equal to 5.2 billion and
the whole population of the

00:24:20.413 --> 00:24:24.534
earth is only 6.3,
so you're talking about China's

00:24:24.534 --> 00:24:29.333
economic and population growth
alone almost doubling the

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:33.957
world's economic activity and
therefore something like

00:24:33.957 --> 00:24:37.358
doubling the economic drain on
it.

00:24:37.358 --> 00:24:41.622
China's TFR now,
after this period of stability

00:24:41.622 --> 00:24:47.087
and after the marriage thing got
settled it has drifted down

00:24:47.087 --> 00:24:50.980
slowly as almost all of the
world has.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.673
It's now 1.6,
it's still nowhere near one

00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:57.498
child per family,
its 1.6 now,

00:24:57.498 --> 00:25:01.897
but that will eventually reduce
the size of the Chinese

00:25:01.897 --> 00:25:04.670
population if it is maintained.
 

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:11.077
What you should keep in mind
is, this was the Chinese route

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.509
to lower population.
 

00:25:13.509 --> 00:25:16.971
I described to you the
population that they started

00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:21.055
with that was not paying any
attention to individual desires

00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:25.000
in fertility and they brought it
down by strong government

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.744
policy,
good amount of coercion and so

00:25:27.744 --> 00:25:28.160
forth.
 

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.749
The Chinese populations around
other parts of East Asia have

00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:35.095
lowered their birth rate even
more, or I should say they

00:25:35.095 --> 00:25:37.497
started lower;
they reached an even lower

00:25:37.497 --> 00:25:37.849
level.
 

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:41.920
China is 1.6 as I told you;
the Chinese population of

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.568
Singapore is 1.4 children per
women.

00:25:44.568 --> 00:25:47.623
The Japanese,
who are not Chinese obviously,

00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:50.430
1.3;
Taiwan 1.1;

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.938
South Korea,
again not Chinese,

00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:57.750
1.3;
Hong Kong 1.0 and Macau 1.0.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.160
None of these places were under
the one-child policy.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.137
Actually I'm not sure about
Macau, but all the others are

00:26:02.137 --> 00:26:05.722
not under the one child policy,
and they have a lower birth

00:26:05.722 --> 00:26:10.903
rate than the Chinese policy,
and we'll have to discuss in a

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:13.920
later lecture why this should be
so.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.053
I'm going to finish up talking
specifically about China to

00:26:18.053 --> 00:26:21.969
mention a little bit about
economic globalization which

00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:23.710
you're all aware of.
 

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.794
Because of globalization the
U.S.

00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:28.009
and China are joined at the
hip.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:32.816
For both our economies to
succeed, we have to buy a lot of

00:26:32.816 --> 00:26:35.714
Chinese stuff,
they have to buy our bonds,

00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:38.700
they keep their people employed
by shipping us stuff,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.200
and we send them green paper
back.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.002
The economics of this is quite
crazy altogether because they

00:26:45.002 --> 00:26:47.241
can never use--
what's interesting is they

00:26:47.241 --> 00:26:49.568
basically can never use the
money that we send them.

00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:52.628
That if--they have a trillion
dollars or so in U.S.

00:26:52.628 --> 00:26:55.993
bonds and if they ever try to
sell them the value of the

00:26:55.993 --> 00:26:59.848
dollar goes to zero and they
have to sell them for nothing.

00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:02.028
That's a separate story,
it's crazy.

00:27:02.028 --> 00:27:05.028
Lot of causes--reasons for
globalization.

00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:07.999
Number one is shipping costs,
the whole idea of the shipping

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:11.623
when it went to containers,
the cost of shipping something

00:27:11.623 --> 00:27:15.920
from China to the West Coast of
America dropped drastically.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.528
Ships carry an awful lot,
the water floats them across,

00:27:18.528 --> 00:27:21.777
and they just have to--the only
energy that's used is to get

00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:24.750
over the friction of the water
that they go through.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.921
Even many years ago I was in
Bolivia discussing with an AID

00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:32.230
guy, Bolivia is very poor,
what can they do?

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.694
Well they have the mountains
but then they have a jungle

00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:37.250
sloping down to the Amazon where
they could grow rice,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:44.123
very good agricultural land,
and why can't they give that to

00:27:44.123 --> 00:27:48.615
Lima or to La Paz,
Lima and Peru where they're

00:27:48.615 --> 00:27:49.828
importing rice.
 

00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:52.682
The problem was that the
Chinese can grow it in the

00:27:52.682 --> 00:27:55.395
Yangtze Valley,
float it down the river to

00:27:55.395 --> 00:27:57.050
Shanghai,
put it on a boat,

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.210
and ship it and deliver it to
Callao,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.683
Lima's port,
cheaper than the Bolivians who

00:28:01.683 --> 00:28:04.630
are right next door to Peru can
truck it over --

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.720
the Andes sort of go up and
down and up again--

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.798
and down again and they have to
ship it--

00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:12.912
to get to the coast they have
to ship it over two peaks of

00:28:12.912 --> 00:28:15.535
mountains on lousy roads,
and trucking is just very

00:28:15.535 --> 00:28:16.358
inefficient.
 

00:28:16.358 --> 00:28:20.439
It's cheaper to get the thing
from 15,000 miles away up in

00:28:20.439 --> 00:28:24.519
Sichuan than to get it next door
from the Amazon slopes of

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:26.575
Bolivia,
so shipping costs is very

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:27.068
important.
 

00:28:27.068 --> 00:28:29.808
For white collar jobs it's
telecommunication.

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:33.019
Now--we used to say let's let
the low,

00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:37.819
the cheap labor manufacturing
jobs go to China but now China

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:41.195
and India we're in--
its immediate contact by

00:28:41.195 --> 00:28:45.230
telecommunications so the white
collar jobs are going there.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.019
The engineering is going to
India, the accounting is going

00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:52.011
to India, the call centers are
going to India,

00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:54.538
and other jobs are going to
China.

00:28:54.538 --> 00:29:01.028
This--what happens to
population I think,

00:29:01.028 --> 00:29:04.268
in the long term view,
and long terms means 25 or 50

00:29:04.268 --> 00:29:06.393
years,
I'm not talking 1000 years,

00:29:06.393 --> 00:29:09.903
probably the one most important
thing which will determine the

00:29:09.903 --> 00:29:10.938
future of the U.S.
 

00:29:10.938 --> 00:29:14.160
economy is what happens to
population in China and India,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.440
and you can include Indonesia
and the rest of Asia.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.547
As long as they have an
incredible number of people

00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:25.753
willing to work for incredibly--
needing to work for incredibly

00:29:25.753 --> 00:29:27.890
low wages,
we can't compete with them.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.729
There is no economic reason why
an American should earn $40 a

00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:34.352
day or something like that,
plus benefits,

00:29:34.352 --> 00:29:37.038
and that's a low wage for an
American.

00:29:37.038 --> 00:29:41.742
Whereas, a third of China the
per capita income is about $1 a

00:29:41.742 --> 00:29:46.289
day for the lowest third of
China and that means the worker

00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:48.250
makes $2 or $3 a day.
 

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.900
There's no way that we can
earn, without benefits,

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.259
that we can earn $40 or $80
depending on what you calculate

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:57.390
and other people in the other
world are earning $3,

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.740
so jobs are going to continue
to go to China;

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.410
not only from the United States.
 

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.680
They are leaving Mexico.
 

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.112
I told you the story in
Thailand, the jewelry business

00:30:05.112 --> 00:30:09.729
in Thailand that moved to China,
that there's just this vast,

00:30:09.729 --> 00:30:14.511
vast sea of people who are
desperate to work for basically

00:30:14.511 --> 00:30:15.519
$2 a day.
 

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:18.484
A further thing happening,
there are now a few 100 million

00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:20.410
people floating around the
cities,

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.278
migrant laborers trying to get
jobs,

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:24.500
and now with the current
economic climate,

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:28.115
being thrown out of jobs,
but Chinese agriculture is

00:30:28.115 --> 00:30:29.890
incredibly inefficient.
 

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:35.029
As I told you,
the average farm size there is

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:42.390
0.1 acre in China and that's
just economically unsustainable.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.484
The average farm size in the
world is--in Japan is 400 acres

00:30:46.484 --> 00:30:47.180
I think.
 

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.445
No, I'm sorry in the world 400,
in the U.S.,

00:30:49.445 --> 00:30:50.288
an economic U.S.
 

00:30:50.288 --> 00:30:52.818
farm is like thousands of acres
of big farms.

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:55.310
We're talking about that,
eventually China is going to

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.709
have to compete in the
agricultural world on an even

00:30:57.709 --> 00:30:59.588
footing with the rest of the
world,

00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:01.880
which means their farms are
going to have to combine.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.769
That's already happening.
 

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.480
People are voluntarily sort of
pooling their land,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.670
having big things--enough of
the land to be--

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.710
to make it worth them to buy a
tractor and so forth,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.930
so this economic
rationalization of agriculture

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:15.980
is happening.
 

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:21.805
Think of the numbers there,
you have 800 million peasants

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:23.990
with 0.1 acre each.
 

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.855
When you combine it even to 100
acre farm, which is still a

00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:31.786
small farm worldwide that means
you combined 1000 farms into

00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:32.318
one.
 

00:31:32.318 --> 00:31:37.714
In the modern world 100 acres
is probably farmed by one or two

00:31:37.714 --> 00:31:41.173
people,
so you go from 1000 families

00:31:41.173 --> 00:31:47.057
living on 0.1 acre each to maybe
two families living on 100 acres

00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:49.078
of a combined farm.
 

00:31:49.078 --> 00:31:52.976
That means that something like
99% of the population of the

00:31:52.976 --> 00:31:56.000
countryside has to get jobs
somewhere else.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.265
If you have 800 million
peasants, almost 800 million new

00:32:00.265 --> 00:32:04.685
people are waiting for these
economic changes to come onto

00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:10.458
the modern job market,
and so there are a vast number

00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:14.757
of people waiting,
that are now competing with us

00:32:14.757 --> 00:32:17.588
and every other industrial
advanced country,

00:32:17.588 --> 00:32:20.548
and who will continue to
compete with us.

00:32:20.548 --> 00:32:23.530
The Chinese government is well
aware, of course,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:24.798
of all this stuff.
 

00:32:24.798 --> 00:32:28.338
In October last year,
previously I--

00:32:28.338 --> 00:32:31.358
they don't really own their
land and they still don't,

00:32:31.358 --> 00:32:34.878
but they what they call a land
reform and the plan allows

00:32:34.878 --> 00:32:38.712
farmers for the first time to
lease or transfer their land use

00:32:38.712 --> 00:32:40.410
rights to someone else.
 

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.318
Basically the Chinese are now
allowed to sell their farm,

00:32:43.318 --> 00:32:45.673
which will ease--now they have
to have very complicated

00:32:45.673 --> 00:32:48.069
collective arrangements where
everybody is sort of still

00:32:48.069 --> 00:32:50.659
there,
but once you can basically sell

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:53.108
or alienate your land in some
way,

00:32:53.108 --> 00:32:57.890
than you can totally leave the
land and go into the cities.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:02.160
The government has started
encouraging this kind of push.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.260
What they'll do now,
with the economic collapse,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.890
I don't know.
 

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:14.036
It's--we have a long way to go
before the population issue in

00:33:14.036 --> 00:33:19.097
China is settled and our fate
and all of the developed world

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:23.130
depends very much on what
happens in China.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.952
Just to finish,
the Chinese have--the

00:33:26.952 --> 00:33:31.730
achievement of China is just
mind boggling.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.734
that In a half a century they
took people from an extremely

00:33:35.734 --> 00:33:39.596
poor country,
devastated by over 100 years of

00:33:39.596 --> 00:33:41.976
war,
and now it's becoming one of

00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:44.680
the first ranked countries in
the world.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.489
Before this all started,
no one would have thought this

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:48.269
was possible.
 

00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:51.017
If you can read the literature
of that time,

00:33:51.017 --> 00:33:52.358
China was hopeless.
 

00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:55.397
With respect to fertility,
which you'll see is a very

00:33:55.397 --> 00:33:58.730
important part of the whole
story of economic success,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.891
their decline,
the rapidity of their decline

00:34:01.891 --> 00:34:06.375
to get a country like China to
drop its fertility in ten years

00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:13.409
is just an amazing achievement;
just incredible.

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:23.190
Now, we want to get onto this
next question that a student

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.280
asked last time.
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.313
When I was saying the
Chinese--remember the Chinese

00:34:29.313 --> 00:34:32.530
started this population thing
for economic reasons.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:38.039
They said--our economy is going
along,

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:39.456
we're increasing,
like I said,

00:34:39.456 --> 00:34:41.949
agricultural production what
was it 2.5% a year,

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.702
which was very good -- but
population is growing 2.3% a

00:34:44.702 --> 00:34:46.510
year,
so we're not helping the people.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:52.275
It was very overtly stated that
the one-child policy was to

00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:54.860
improve China's economy.
 

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.655
They wanted to improve the
standard of living of the

00:34:57.655 --> 00:34:58.150
people.
 

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.489
At the time,
when they started this policy,

00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.942
the standard of living in China
was very low,

00:35:02.942 --> 00:35:05.059
and I don't have to tell you
that.

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:08.784
Healthcare was very--was
certainly better than it had

00:35:08.784 --> 00:35:11.219
been but still a very low level.
 

00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:15.634
Education was not widely
available below the very early

00:35:15.634 --> 00:35:17.760
primary grades in China.
 

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.759
Basically, as the Chinese
perceived it themselves,

00:35:20.759 --> 00:35:24.371
and as they talked about it
quite a bit, their children were

00:35:24.371 --> 00:35:26.820
growing up unhealthy and
uneducated.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.250
When the Chinese talk about
economic development,

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.130
it's not only manufacturing
more stuff which they basically

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.800
are not too interested in,
they ship it to America.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.143
They were primarily interested
in what they called the quality

00:35:39.143 --> 00:35:39.760
of the people.
 

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.458
They thought their population
was not of the quality that they

00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:46.429
wanted, and quality means health
and education.

00:35:46.429 --> 00:35:50.739
They wanted--their children
were growing up not healthy and

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:53.143
not educated,
and they like everyone in the

00:35:53.143 --> 00:35:55.150
world,
realizes that uneducated,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.900
sick children,
and sick adults don't--are not

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.420
very productive.
 

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.070
Western economists,
for a long time,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.916
considered capitalist--physical
capital your factories and

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:11.032
machines that you have and the
idea of human-capital is fairly

00:36:11.032 --> 00:36:14.407
recent and has now come
massively into vogue in the

00:36:14.407 --> 00:36:15.150
West.
 

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.657
That one of the most important
determinants of the wealth of a

00:36:17.657 --> 00:36:19.619
country,
why is one country rich and one

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:23.148
country poor is not resources,
is not your physical capital

00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:25.610
base, but your human capital
base.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.599
Partly we've learned that from
the Chinese.

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:32.498
I mean we learned it ourselves
but also the Chinese examples

00:36:32.498 --> 00:36:34.679
were very good example of this.
 

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:39.309
Just to give you an example of
what happens when people don't

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:41.869
have education,
in this particular case

00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:45.804
biological education,
is a story from again the year

00:36:45.804 --> 00:36:48.929
2000--
again not that many years back.

00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:53.960
This is from Du who was a local
official in a small village.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.469
He said, "One day there
were hundreds of people lined up

00:36:57.469 --> 00:37:01.027
at the entrance of our village,
I thought it must be a

00:37:01.027 --> 00:37:03.809
vegetable market or a movie
coming in.

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:05.949
It turned out to be blood
selling.

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:09.244
I felt so terrified because
there was no sterilization

00:37:09.244 --> 00:37:10.800
equipment at all."
 

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.519
This village official had some
education, he understood about

00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:18.117
sterilization and he had seen
these blood campaigns before,

00:37:18.117 --> 00:37:19.420
no sterilization.
 

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.351
"Villagers just tell the
traffickers their blood type,

00:37:23.351 --> 00:37:26.199
if they know it,
if not they make it up.

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:29.246
The villagers just tell the
traffickers their blood type and

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.829
then lie die on the ground to
offer blood."

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:34.110
What is the result of this?
 

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.693
A vast AIDS epidemic in these
rural villages that were doing

00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:39.572
this,
because they use the same

00:37:39.572 --> 00:37:42.860
needle to repeatedly take blood
from person after person,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.766
they line up on the ground and
they stick one needle,

00:37:44.766 --> 00:37:45.389
take the blood.
 

00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:48.458
Needles are so expensive,
the apparatus for collecting it

00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:50.597
is expensive,
and so they reuse the same

00:37:50.597 --> 00:37:51.199
needle.
 

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:56.012
Of course when you use the same
needle from person to person the

00:37:56.012 --> 00:38:00.597
odds are if one person gets it
the next ones are going to get

00:38:00.597 --> 00:38:02.748
it,
but actually the transmission

00:38:02.748 --> 00:38:05.985
rate by blood to blood contact
by a needle is something like 1

00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:08.329
in 200,
it's not terribly efficient.

00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:11.059
What do they do with the blood?
 

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:12.960
They collect blood from
everybody, then instead of

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.990
keeping it individually,
which is expensive,

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.235
they dump it into a big vat,
they pool it,

00:38:17.235 --> 00:38:19.909
they take it to the city,
they extract the components

00:38:19.909 --> 00:38:21.960
that they want which is the
gamma globulin,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.505
the clotting factor,
and a few other components and

00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:26.389
then they have a lot of blood
left.

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:27.239
What do they do?
 

00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:30.277
They go back to the village and
re-inject the blood,

00:38:30.277 --> 00:38:32.539
the remaining blood into the
people.

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:34.309
Now you don't just have a
needle stick,

00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:37.775
you've got a pint of someone
else--of a mixed blood of

00:38:37.775 --> 00:38:40.980
everyone in the village going
into your veins,

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.628
and now for sure if anyone in
the village has AIDS you're

00:38:44.628 --> 00:38:46.650
going to be infected with it.
 

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.110
Du continued,
"The villagers become

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.456
crazy about selling blood
because they are so poor and

00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:53.719
life is so hard.
 

00:38:53.719 --> 00:38:57.389
Many had built their houses by
selling blood.

00:38:57.389 --> 00:39:00.338
Some will even bribe
traffickers to be able to sell

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.050
more than once a day."
 

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.157
The traffickers are interested
in giving them back blood

00:39:04.157 --> 00:39:05.690
because then they'll make more
blood,

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.472
they can sell more blood again,
but the people want to sell

00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:13.224
more than a pint in each day,
so they kind of lie and fake

00:39:13.224 --> 00:39:14.710
because they're so poor.
 

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.641
The officials estimate
something like 600,000 HIV

00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:25.369
cases, that's probably nowhere
near correct.

00:39:25.369 --> 00:39:29.168
The blood collections,
starting in the 1990s,

00:39:29.168 --> 00:39:32.449
were protected by corrupt
officials.

00:39:32.449 --> 00:39:34.768
This was of course against
public policy,

00:39:34.768 --> 00:39:38.360
but it may have infected a
million people,

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.219
this blood selling in Henan
Province,

00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:45.596
especially and virtually all of
them poor peasants who sold the

00:39:45.596 --> 00:39:47.150
blood to make money.
 

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:54.143
That gives you an idea again of
the status of education of the

00:39:54.143 --> 00:40:00.679
population and why human capital
is so very important,

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:03.690
because you're collecting blood
to sell to hospitals,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.077
which will improve the health
of presumably of some people who

00:40:06.077 --> 00:40:08.460
receive the blood,
but not if they get AIDS.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:14.615
While you're helping a few
people with transfusions you're

00:40:14.615 --> 00:40:20.449
infecting millions of people
with AIDS so you're making

00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:23.150
things totally worse.
 

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.155
Does cutting your
population--so China had the

00:40:27.155 --> 00:40:30.804
idea, not alone,
that if they reduce their

00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:35.610
population growth rate their
economy will improve.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.199
Is this true?
 

00:40:39.199 --> 00:40:43.047
Most economists,
at the time,

00:40:43.047 --> 00:40:47.309
would certainly have said no.
 

00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:52.449
That's a Malthusian idea that
population--

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:56.880
that economic development is
limited by population growth and

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.793
people thought that the
industrial revolution had sort

00:41:00.793 --> 00:41:04.130
of gotten rid of Malthus,
Malthus was irrelevant.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.590
Marx, as I mentioned last time,
hated Malthus.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:11.088
Marx was totally opposed and so
a lot of the world's opinion was

00:41:11.088 --> 00:41:15.659
that no, population growth was
not detrimental to the economy.

00:41:15.659 --> 00:41:20.092
In fact, they believed that
population growth was good for

00:41:20.092 --> 00:41:23.670
an economy because it increased
the market,

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.179
and everybody wants to increase
the market,

00:41:25.179 --> 00:41:30.340
and you can get efficiencies of
scale for all kinds of reasons,

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.103
a growing population was
considered to be a wonderful

00:41:33.103 --> 00:41:33.530
thing.
 

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.824
Businessmen,
especially in the capitalist

00:41:35.824 --> 00:41:38.418
economies,
love population growth because

00:41:38.418 --> 00:41:40.760
the population of the United
States,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.119
for instance,
is now growing at 1% a year,

00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:46.869
which is less than it had been,
it had been 1.5% or so.

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:51.360
The economic growth rate is
about 3%, at best in a very good

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.719
year, in a good year it's 3%.
 

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:59.454
Population growth at 1% or
1.5%, if your total economy is

00:41:59.454 --> 00:42:03.570
growing at 2% or 3%,
population growth is half the

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.092
increase in gross national
product and that means it's half

00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:08.429
of company profits.
 

00:42:08.429 --> 00:42:11.963
When you have General Motors,
it was counting every year on

00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:15.679
population growing and being
able to sell more automobiles.

00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:21.521
That was basically the idea
that population growth was not a

00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:22.710
bad thing.
 

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:29.458
In 1958 two American
demographer economists had a

00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.849
different idea.
 

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:35.914
They looked at the developing
countries, which had enormous

00:42:35.914 --> 00:42:40.259
population and very high growth
rates and they weren't doing so

00:42:40.259 --> 00:42:40.889
well.
 

00:42:40.889 --> 00:42:42.760
What's with this theory?
 

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.255
They should be doing
wonderfully, they should be

00:42:46.255 --> 00:42:49.280
improving tremendously,
and they came up with a

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.172
different understanding of the
relationship between population

00:42:52.172 --> 00:42:52.980
and economics.
 

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.940
This is based on some very
simply economics.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.090
That economic development
requires investment.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.994
If you want to produce
something you've got to build a

00:43:01.994 --> 00:43:03.110
factory and that takes money.
 

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.389
Where does that money come from?
 

00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:06.380
That comes from someone else
saving.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.824
Someone earns some money,
by his labor or by whatever,

00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:12.585
earns some money;
he can either spend that right

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:15.380
away or he can put it in the
bank and then the bank will

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.382
invest it for him,
or he can put it into stocks or

00:43:18.382 --> 00:43:19.659
something like that.
 

00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:23.800
Investment in a country,
within some kind of economy,

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.190
investment requires savings.
 

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.568
One person has to save so
another can spend it as an

00:43:30.568 --> 00:43:33.230
investment, they borrow that.
 

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.920
That's the key idea in
everything that follows.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.059
What Coale and Hoover realized
is that if you have--

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:49.704
if a family has a lot of
children, if all the workers are

00:43:49.704 --> 00:43:51.500
married and have a lot of
children,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.800
all of their income goes for
food, clothing,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.219
and shelter to support the
children.

00:43:57.219 --> 00:43:58.809
They can't save any money.
 

00:43:58.809 --> 00:44:02.405
If a country has no savings,
they don't have any money to

00:44:02.405 --> 00:44:05.489
invest, they don't make any
economic progress.

00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:09.659
This had a big political
effect, this theory.

00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:12.639
It seems so simple and so
obvious but it--

00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:15.289
apparently they had good
empirical support,

00:44:15.289 --> 00:44:17.860
they studied Mexico and a
couple of other countries,

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.809
and showed that this really
seemed to be the case.

00:44:21.809 --> 00:44:25.407
Well at that time the third
world was--the population

00:44:25.407 --> 00:44:28.936
explosion was happening,
they were desperately poor,

00:44:28.936 --> 00:44:31.219
and so there were two groups.
 

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:35.530
One, conservatives were at that
time worried about the Cold War.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.931
America was locked in the Cold
War with communists and China,

00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:44.480
Russia, but especially Russia
was our big enemy at the time.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.900
We saw that all these
desperately poor countries,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.585
the governments were not--their
current economic and political

00:44:49.585 --> 00:44:51.610
systems were not giving them
what they want.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.750
They were poor and getting
poorer as they perceived it,

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.086
and they were trying out all
kinds of different political

00:44:57.086 --> 00:44:59.159
solutions,
some of which were leftist.

00:44:59.159 --> 00:45:02.739
In America, there was a big
push by conservatives,

00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:06.684
by the anti-communists,
to do something about the third

00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:09.460
world to save them from
communism.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.827
Meanwhile, the liberals were
less involved in this us versus

00:45:13.827 --> 00:45:16.782
them kind of controversy,
but they saw all these poor

00:45:16.782 --> 00:45:18.780
people in the world and wanted
to help all the poor people,

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.320
so they thought we should do
something about all these poor

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.981
people,
and the answer was economic

00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:23.570
development.
 

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.228
Economic development was
universally approved in America

00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:31.311
by everyone,
as either benevolent act by

00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:34.532
someone who considered
themselves liberal or by a

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:38.291
self-serving anti-communist act
by someone who considered

00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:40.170
himself a conservative.
 

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:45.721
Well, once the Coale/Hoover
paper came out and people

00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:50.117
started realizing the--
what was considered to be the

00:45:50.117 --> 00:45:53.545
obvious at that time,
it was very clear that family

00:45:53.545 --> 00:45:57.800
planning programs had to be a
part of economic development.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.842
That these countries just--with
these booming populations and

00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:03.429
there were televisions full of
stories of India,

00:46:03.429 --> 00:46:05.449
and how it was starving people
in India.

00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:08.159
China was kind of closed to us
at that time,

00:46:08.159 --> 00:46:10.990
but India was open,
but a desperate situation that

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.400
was in India and India had quite
leftist governments and was

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.539
India going to go communist,
etc.

00:46:16.539 --> 00:46:20.800
Both sides of the--the whole
political spectrum believed in

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.429
economic aid to the developing
world and family planning aid.

00:46:25.429 --> 00:46:28.639
It turns out that George Bush,
the senior,

00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:31.021
the first George Bush
President, when he was a

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:33.773
congressman was one of the
sponsors of the very first

00:46:33.773 --> 00:46:36.889
family planning bill,
not only for domestic family

00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.934
planning but also the
international aid for family

00:46:39.934 --> 00:46:40.679
planning.
 

00:46:40.679 --> 00:46:44.179
This was not a debatable issue,
everybody agreed with it,

00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:47.742
and it was really due to this
economic thesis by Coale and

00:46:47.742 --> 00:46:48.429
Hoover.
 

00:46:48.429 --> 00:46:51.460
You've read some of Ansley
Coale's stuff already.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.710
Now, however,
the economists keep working,

00:46:54.710 --> 00:47:18.005
the scholars keep going--what
they did is they looked cross

00:47:18.005 --> 00:47:33.268
nationally and tried to figure
out,

00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:39.137
is it really true that
population growth rate would

00:47:39.137 --> 00:47:42.664
affect GDP,
the growth of gross domestic

00:47:42.664 --> 00:47:45.329
product per capita,
it's basically per capita

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:45.730
income.
 

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.317
What did they find when they
got all the countries they could

00:47:48.317 --> 00:47:49.179
find in the world?
 

00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:52.632
Here's the growth rate and
here's per capita economic

00:47:52.632 --> 00:47:53.230
growth.
 

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.449
What's the pattern?
 

00:47:56.449 --> 00:48:01.646
Zero, there is no pattern here,
so it looks like that this--it

00:48:01.646 --> 00:48:03.179
was meaningless.
 

00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:07.327
That in fact the Coale/Hoover
hypothesis was wrong,

00:48:07.327 --> 00:48:11.971
and however nice the theory
seemed, you just couldn't get

00:48:11.971 --> 00:48:14.460
empirical evidence for it.
 

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.099
That was terribly important,
again a reversal,

00:48:18.099 --> 00:48:21.782
now the Reagan Administration
comes in and on the basis of

00:48:21.782 --> 00:48:26.797
information like that says,
economic population control is

00:48:26.797 --> 00:48:30.489
no benefit to an economy's
growth,

00:48:30.489 --> 00:48:33.092
and we, as conservatives,
are opposed to government

00:48:33.092 --> 00:48:35.539
intervention in the private
lives of people,

00:48:35.539 --> 00:48:39.340
so we're opposed to--we're not
going to give out the--

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.141
anywhere near the level of
family planning aid that we used

00:48:43.141 --> 00:48:43.469
to.
 

00:48:43.469 --> 00:48:46.474
The United States went from a
big leader in funding family

00:48:46.474 --> 00:48:49.320
planning programs in the rest of
the world to trying to

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.268
discourage it.
 

00:48:50.268 --> 00:48:53.427
We didn't drop to zero,
there were still programs that

00:48:53.427 --> 00:48:56.050
we funded and they were very
good by AID,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.800
but we were the main
discourager in the world,

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.909
we didn't like this whole idea.
 

00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:06.429
What came up as--in opposition
to this,

00:49:06.429 --> 00:49:09.431
and there was a big World
Congress about population and

00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:13.364
development in Bucharest,
Romania at the time,

00:49:13.364 --> 00:49:20.489
and the kind of data that came
out in this period is they--

00:49:20.489 --> 00:49:25.070
they came out with the idea
that the way to get--

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.983
that it is good to have
fertility down for a lot of

00:49:27.983 --> 00:49:31.014
reasons but the way to do it,
that the causality,

00:49:31.014 --> 00:49:34.757
the Coale/Hoover causality is a
reduction in population growth

00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:37.090
will lead to economic
development,

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:42.570
that the idea of the reverse
causality that an increase in

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:48.340
economic development will lead
to a decrease in fertility.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.612
The slogan that came out of
this Bucharest meeting of all

00:49:53.612 --> 00:49:57.090
the world leaders,
is that development was the

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.550
best contraceptive,
that if you wanted to lower

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.980
birth rates,
what you had to focus on was

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.150
economic development.
 

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:09.016
And that became the mantra for
the world and the developing

00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:10.949
countries bought into that.
 

00:50:10.949 --> 00:50:14.460
It was very interesting because
just at that time Romania,

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.710
the host of this meeting,
was having the most extreme

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.219
family planning program ever,
but in the opposite direction.

00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:24.635
They, at that time,
it was a Soviet block country

00:50:24.635 --> 00:50:27.340
that was doing poorly
economically,

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.978
their birth rate was very low,
their mechanism of birth

00:50:30.978 --> 00:50:34.972
control was abortion;
4 out of 5 pregnancies were

00:50:34.972 --> 00:50:38.230
terminated by abortions in
Romania.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:42.000
For every one child-birth,
there were four abortions.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.237
Romania, not for economic
reasons, but for nationalist

00:50:45.237 --> 00:50:48.965
reasons, they wanted a bigger
stronger Romania so they clamped

00:50:48.965 --> 00:50:50.309
down tremendously.
 

00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:51.990
Abortion completely
de-legalized,

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.250
you couldn't get contraceptives
anymore,

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:59.797
and the end result was that the
birth rate temporarily fell but

00:50:59.797 --> 00:51:04.985
then the women established
networks of illegal abortion and

00:51:04.985 --> 00:51:10.085
gradually the birth rate rose
because they didn't have any

00:51:10.085 --> 00:51:12.918
means,
but very rapidly within a year

00:51:12.918 --> 00:51:15.922
or a two they established
illegal abortion networks and

00:51:15.922 --> 00:51:17.480
the birth rate came down.
 

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.210
It never came down to its
original level and there's

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.050
actually a fairly big total
effect of their policy.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:29.590
It was just the political
chicanery going on that here,

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:32.630
Ceausescu, who was running
Romania as a very strong

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.827
communist dictator,
was doing a very strong

00:51:35.827 --> 00:51:39.152
pronatalist family policy,
but saying no,

00:51:39.152 --> 00:51:42.536
the opposite won't work;
you have to go through economic

00:51:42.536 --> 00:51:43.159
development.
 

00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:49.730
Then people went to work on
that theory and here's the data,

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.731
that in this period of time,
these are the countries with

00:51:53.731 --> 00:51:58.164
slow economic growth and their
population growth rate was about

00:51:58.164 --> 00:52:02.309
2.7% and here's the ones with
fast economic growth rate and

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:04.965
their--
fast economic growth and

00:52:04.965 --> 00:52:08.420
they're the same in terms of
population growth.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.317
Here's your look some years
later and you have the same

00:52:11.317 --> 00:52:13.304
story,
those with slow economic

00:52:13.304 --> 00:52:17.253
growth, those with fast economic
growth have the same population

00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:17.880
growth.
 

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.159
It is not true that development
itself acts as a contraceptive.

00:52:23.159 --> 00:52:26.059
You look at it,
you spin the data,

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:30.847
the same data but differently,
you look at those countries

00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:35.300
which have slow population
growth which are these,

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.518
and while it wasn't--or fast
population growth--

00:52:37.518 --> 00:52:40.690
and you ask,
is that affecting GDP?

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:44.760
And you're not seeing a big
effect here in this time frame.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:49.469
But you are seeing a big time
effect in this time frame.

00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:51.599
Now something different is
going on,

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:55.327
here those countries with slow
population growth are increasing

00:52:55.327 --> 00:52:57.768
economically,
those countries with fast

00:52:57.768 --> 00:53:00.550
population growth are decreasing
economically.

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.670
The funny thing about this
graph, you say well it's the

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.789
same data, how can you come to
opposite conclusions?

00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:07.099
It's not, the same data spun
differently.

00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:12.773
This is the population growth
rate in 1965 to 1980 and then

00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:18.840
the economic situation 25 years
later, 15 to 25 years later.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.695
So something it looks like
from--This is not wildly

00:53:22.695 --> 00:53:25.835
conclusive data,
but something about population

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:29.134
growth,
much later, has an effect on

00:53:29.134 --> 00:53:31.329
your economic growth.
 

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:35.585
That's what has now been
figured out to be exactly the

00:53:35.585 --> 00:53:40.242
really important relationship
between population growth and

00:53:40.242 --> 00:53:42.250
economic development.
 

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.639
You've seen this graph many,
many times.

00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:47.797
This is the standard
demographic transition where the

00:53:47.797 --> 00:53:50.800
mortality rate,
the death rate falls first,

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.117
then after some delay the birth
rate falls and your population

00:53:55.117 --> 00:53:59.507
growth rate is this period when
the birth rate is way above the

00:53:59.507 --> 00:54:00.639
death rate.
 

00:54:00.639 --> 00:54:05.090
Another aspect of that,
here's the same graph again up

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:09.793
here, is that if you ask what
does the share working look

00:54:09.793 --> 00:54:10.550
like?
 

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:12.429
How many of these people are
working?

00:54:12.429 --> 00:54:16.445
You have an idea called the
'dependency ratio' which is your

00:54:16.445 --> 00:54:19.371
number of workers,
divided by your number of

00:54:19.371 --> 00:54:22.230
children and your number of old
folks.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:25.476
Well in developing countries
the medical care is bad so you

00:54:25.476 --> 00:54:28.447
don't have--
you can almost ignore the old

00:54:28.447 --> 00:54:31.090
folks for quite a period of
time,

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.228
so basically the workers
divided by the number of

00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:33.719
children.
 

00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:42.905
What happens during this period
is that as the fertility rate

00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:50.099
falls what happens is you have a
population--

00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:52.938
we've seen the population
pyramid for that with a number

00:54:52.938 --> 00:54:55.829
of workers in the middle and
then many more children than

00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:58.480
workers,
half again as many children as

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.659
workers,
so each worker has to

00:55:00.659 --> 00:55:04.858
support--each person in working
age has to support 1.5 or 2

00:55:04.858 --> 00:55:07.030
children of children's age.
 

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.144
Then you get this fantastic
fertility drop,

00:55:10.144 --> 00:55:13.929
as we saw in places like China,
where, in ten years,

00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:17.489
the fertility comes down,
and what happened?

00:55:17.489 --> 00:55:20.998
This is the big population of
people at that age,

00:55:20.998 --> 00:55:24.289
and there's no children coming
behind them.

00:55:24.289 --> 00:55:27.547
Kids are born,
you have a very high

00:55:27.547 --> 00:55:29.833
population,
kids are born,

00:55:29.833 --> 00:55:33.606
then all of a sudden the
population stops having children

00:55:33.606 --> 00:55:35.679
basically,
it drops tremendously,

00:55:35.679 --> 00:55:37.940
but you still have all these
children born.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.510
It takes 15,20 years for them
to get into working age,

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:46.041
so once you drop your fertility
you see no effect then because

00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:50.201
you still have to support all
those children for the next

00:55:50.201 --> 00:55:51.389
15,20 years.
 

00:55:51.389 --> 00:55:55.146
It's only after delay of 15 to
20 years that you have this huge

00:55:55.146 --> 00:55:57.329
number of people in working
ages,

00:55:57.329 --> 00:56:02.128
very few children behind them,
and the ratio of workers to

00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:04.739
dependents becomes very good.
 

00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:07.909
This is the--the people inside
the snake.

00:56:07.909 --> 00:56:10.788
That's a takeoff on another
'you are here' graph that I

00:56:10.788 --> 00:56:13.880
showed you of the population
growth, anyway forget that.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.606
Here is--you've seen this for
China but here's for all of East

00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:22.947
Asia, this is the death rate and
the death rate is really

00:56:22.947 --> 00:56:25.039
basically down by 1970.
 

00:56:25.039 --> 00:56:28.521
I've showed you that for Egypt
and all around the world that

00:56:28.521 --> 00:56:31.945
the mortality rate comes down
fast and then doesn't make an

00:56:31.945 --> 00:56:34.130
awful lot of progress since
then.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.449
This is people aging,
so this is where we are now,

00:56:36.449 --> 00:56:39.887
about 2009, so this stuff is
all guessing about the future

00:56:39.887 --> 00:56:43.146
but basically since 1970 the
death rate has been pretty

00:56:43.146 --> 00:56:45.739
constant but the birth rate
comes down.

00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:48.914
This big drop in 1970s,
again this is all of East Asia

00:56:48.914 --> 00:56:52.750
but primarily what you're seeing
is China's big drop in the death

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.010
rate,
and so population growth

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.849
narrows, narrows down to almost
nothing.

00:56:57.849 --> 00:57:02.634
Presumably in the near future
the death rate will climb above

00:57:02.634 --> 00:57:03.989
the birth rate.
 

00:57:03.989 --> 00:57:07.706
In looking at age structure,
this is kind of a complicated

00:57:07.706 --> 00:57:09.730
graph, but they're very cute.
 

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.331
This is Sub-Saharan Africa as a
comparison, this is an opposite

00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:14.030
situation.
 

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.070
Here this is like a piece of a
pyramid;

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:17.349
this is your age group.
 

00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:21.500
Here you have very few old
people, here you have--

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:26.059
in 1950 this stripe is for the
year 1950 very few oldsters,

00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:29.806
this is your working age
population in here say from 20

00:57:29.806 --> 00:57:32.929
to 60 or whatever numbers you
want to put,

00:57:32.929 --> 00:57:35.869
and there's more children in
any age group than any of them.

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:38.239
You've seen the population
pyramid like that.

00:57:38.239 --> 00:57:41.538
Now as time goes on,
in a place like Sub-Saharan

00:57:41.538 --> 00:57:45.677
Africa that does not go through
fertility transition is that

00:57:45.677 --> 00:57:50.380
this shape of more children than
oldsters just continues 1975,

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.289
2000,2025.
 

00:57:52.289 --> 00:57:56.639
You begin to see the--they hope
again--This is where we are now;

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:58.360
this is all guessing about the
future.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:04.300
Up to now that shape of more
children down here--stays

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:10.016
unchanged and just the whole
population gets bigger,

00:58:10.016 --> 00:58:12.369
you've seen that.
 

00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:18.898
Now contrast that to East Asia,
which in 1950 had what looked

00:58:18.898 --> 00:58:24.773
like Sub-Saharan Africa:
many more children than people

00:58:24.773 --> 00:58:29.382
in working ages,
and again very few real old

00:58:29.382 --> 00:58:29.900
folk.
 

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.746
Then time goes on but then you
start seeing funny things happen

00:58:34.746 --> 00:58:37.275
where--
anyway up there follow

00:58:37.275 --> 00:58:42.507
the--anywhere from 1975 and 2000
to the left and you see now the

00:58:42.507 --> 00:58:45.579
number of children starts
dipping.

00:58:45.579 --> 00:58:52.065
Up at the top it dips a lot and
the bulge of children becomes a

00:58:52.065 --> 00:58:56.585
bulge in the working ages,
so you may have a lot of people

00:58:56.585 --> 00:58:59.804
in working ages,
very few children,

00:58:59.804 --> 00:59:05.465
no oldsters yet,
so you don't have anybody that

00:59:05.465 --> 00:59:07.780
you have to support.
 

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.447
What happens is,
you calculate this dependency

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:13.958
ratio;
this is the number of working

00:59:13.958 --> 00:59:17.677
age people to non-working age
and look what happens in East

00:59:17.677 --> 00:59:18.190
Asia.
 

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:23.554
Here's the fertility decline,
as soon as ten years have

00:59:23.554 --> 00:59:27.827
passed boom, boom,
boom the ratio gets to be

00:59:27.827 --> 00:59:29.219
wonderful.
 

00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:32.682
Again we are--at this level
we're somewhere near the peak,

00:59:32.682 --> 00:59:36.449
the rest of this is guesswork
off to the right of that line.

00:59:36.449 --> 00:59:40.335
The dependency ratio just gets
better and better for East Asia

00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:44.157
and this has tremendous--this is
what has tremendous economic

00:59:44.157 --> 00:59:45.239
consequences.
 

00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:49.634
Here is the difference in the
economic growth per year

00:59:49.634 --> 00:59:54.693
over--now this is a 25 year time
period we're not looking at a

00:59:54.693 --> 00:59:56.018
single year.
 

00:59:56.018 --> 01:00:00.489
It's tremendously bigger than a
place like Africa which has not

01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:02.219
reduced its fertility.
 

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:05.532
We say this is based a lot on
savings and you'll have a

01:00:05.532 --> 01:00:09.152
reading about this that you
won't like because it's somewhat

01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:14.065
complicated economics,
but look at the savings rate in

01:00:14.065 --> 01:00:15.219
East Asia.
 

01:00:15.219 --> 01:00:18.945
It goes from 1955,
way before any of this,

01:00:18.945 --> 01:00:23.489
14% to 35%, it goes up like a
factor of 2.5% or 3%;

01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:25.489
tremendous saving.
 

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:28.130
Investment then,
since you're saving,

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:32.094
you can have an incredible
increase in investment which

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:35.030
builds up your country
economically.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.840
Now the catch in this,
that savings equals investment,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.001
you can also borrow money from
abroad and so that's what they

01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:42.900
call the current account
balance,

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:48.018
how much money you can attract
from abroad to get developed.

01:00:48.018 --> 01:00:50.829
We, in the West,
believe that it was Western

01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:54.556
capital that went into China,
allowed them to build up and

01:00:54.556 --> 01:00:56.190
did wonderful things.
 

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.340
But no, it was never huge,
this was a 4.8--

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.559
less than 5% was the
current--now that's a minus sign

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:07.222
in front of it,
that's what they're importing,

01:01:07.222 --> 01:01:11.188
but very rapidly by 1980 they
start to be a net capital

01:01:11.188 --> 01:01:12.070
exporter.
 

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.907
That these poor countries have
an excess of capital and they

01:01:15.907 --> 01:01:19.246
now export to us,
so the development of China in

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.650
particular,
East Asia in general,

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:24.909
is not as you would think a
result of West--

01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:26.449
infusion of Western capital.
 

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:29.554
I mean some of the early
special cases Hong Kong and so

01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:32.851
forth clearly were,
but the main part of China,

01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:36.914
they produced their own capital
because the sequence of

01:01:36.914 --> 01:01:41.750
causality is fertility decline,
you wait 15,20 years all those

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.672
kids grow up,
there's none behind them,

01:01:43.672 --> 01:01:45.487
they all become workers,
you start--you don't have

01:01:45.487 --> 01:01:47.295
children to support,
you start saving,

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:50.137
those savings become
investments and you become one

01:01:50.137 --> 01:01:53.659
of the economic miracles or one
of the tigers of the world.

01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:59.010
Now until recently,
this theory is about 10 or 15

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.842
years old,
we're gradually coming to

01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:04.219
understand this idea about the
economics,

01:02:04.219 --> 01:02:06.480
and we start seeing something
special about Asia.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.039
That, yes, this was important,
but also the culture of Asia,

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:20.320
the propensity to saving--the
savings--

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.059
when China was poor the savings
were not fabulous,

01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:25.699
they are fabulous now,
but they weren't then,

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:27.489
that's a result of being rich.
 

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:31.039
It was thought there was
something special about East

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.623
Asia and China,
in particular,

01:02:33.623 --> 01:02:37.876
something cultural,
and that when you did the

01:02:37.876 --> 01:02:42.130
econometrics you had to have one
set of--

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:45.150
you could use the same amount,
you have one set of parameters

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.869
for Asia and a completely
different set for Africa,

01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:51.289
and another set for Europe when
you don't consider the

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.840
demographic situation.
 

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.291
Once you put in the demographic
situation we now know that the

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.329
same model fits around the
world,

01:02:58.329 --> 01:03:01.333
and it looks like that this
dependency burden is the key

01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:01.768
thing.
 

01:03:01.768 --> 01:03:04.699
One of the things that first
clued us into this was Ireland.

01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:08.739
Ireland, which is a totally
different culture than China,

01:03:08.739 --> 01:03:11.891
had this--it was totally
Catholic and they really

01:03:11.891 --> 01:03:15.239
believed that they used
Catholicism as fighting--

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:18.215
as a mode of fighting the
British and so they had a very

01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:21.409
high birth rate and they didn't
have legal contraception.

01:03:21.409 --> 01:03:24.869
In 1980 the government
legalized contraception.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:28.083
Here's the birth rate,
just takes a drive and then

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:30.840
after a little blip,
continues downward.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.440
Again, it's the government
action of legalizing

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.099
contraception and the Irish
birth rate drops.

01:03:36.099 --> 01:03:38.726
The death rate,
again, is slowly going down and

01:03:38.726 --> 01:03:42.097
then sort of not really going
anywhere in this period and so

01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:44.440
the population growth rate
decreases.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.211
Again, this is the same thing,
you get the same effect that

01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:50.880
Ireland's population looks like
China,

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.344
on a smaller scale,
it's not anywhere near as big

01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:53.766
as China,
but again, you have an

01:03:53.766 --> 01:03:55.590
underdeveloped country looking
thing.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:59.161
There was a lot more children
than middle--than workers or old

01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:02.793
people and then this continues
going up until you start getting

01:04:02.793 --> 01:04:03.789
this decline.
 

01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:07.023
Now in this modern period
currently there's a lot more

01:04:07.023 --> 01:04:10.561
workers than there are either
children or old people so the

01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:12.880
dependency burden looks real
good.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.179
This is the graph of that.
 

01:04:16.179 --> 01:04:19.438
The purple curve on the bottom
is Sub-Saharan Africa which

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:22.411
again up--just consider what's
up to the line because

01:04:22.411 --> 01:04:24.300
everything else is guesswork.
 

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.626
Look, here the black is East
Asia and the green is Ireland,

01:04:28.626 --> 01:04:30.639
looks very, very similar.
 

01:04:30.639 --> 01:04:35.755
Guess what the result is,
here's where they legalized

01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:39.985
birth control,
boom the economic growth rate

01:04:39.985 --> 01:04:44.510
just booms right up ten or so
years later.

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:50.914
Now comparing--starting to
compare this to India,

01:04:50.914 --> 01:04:55.719
here is China's growth per
capita.

01:04:55.719 --> 01:05:00.159
In 1960, China was poorer than
India by a good bit,

01:05:00.159 --> 01:05:02.449
this is per capita income,
the red is China,

01:05:02.449 --> 01:05:04.639
the blue is India,
1960 they're poorer,

01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:06.570
1970 they're poorer,
and 1980 they're poorer.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.557
Wan, Xi, Shao,
the later, longer,

01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:15.349
fewer, the fertility drop is in
this period and it starts going

01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:19.739
and then China takes off and
exceeds India.

01:05:19.739 --> 01:05:23.331
It's not due to the communist
government or a good government

01:05:23.331 --> 01:05:27.045
because the communist revolution
is way out here and for a long

01:05:27.045 --> 01:05:29.980
time it was not doing any better
than India,

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.744
but the main event that
happened then is the drop in

01:05:33.744 --> 01:05:34.630
fertility.
 

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:38.115
This shows you the difference
in China's fertility and India's

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:41.512
fertility,
but here's this Chinese drop

01:05:41.512 --> 01:05:46.626
starting in 1970s and India
slowly catching up but it's

01:05:46.626 --> 01:05:49.280
taking its time about it.
 

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.541
This is the dependency burden,
here again, the ratio of

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:59.219
workers to non-workers really
improving in China,

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:03.409
not going anywhere particular
in India.

01:06:03.409 --> 01:06:07.018
\When you compare it to
Sub-Saharan Africa--again so

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:11.192
we're comparing different parts
of the world to show you the

01:06:11.192 --> 01:06:12.820
story--is the same.
 

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:16.175
This is the birth rate,
the black, and the death rate

01:06:16.175 --> 01:06:18.630
so a huge and continuing
population;

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:24.409
growth rate again up to the
line, this is guesswork out here

01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:27.804
and here is--
again you've seen this before,

01:06:27.804 --> 01:06:32.677
this is China's--
East Asia's dependent ratio

01:06:32.677 --> 01:06:35.570
workers to children.
 

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.731
This is Africa,
there is a huge difference

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:39.579
going on.
 

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:46.050
This is the situation--in
Sub-Saharan Africa the working

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:50.050
age population has gone up 2.6%.
 

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:53.422
Even if you can keep all those
people employed when the

01:06:53.422 --> 01:06:56.797
dependent population goes up
2.7% you're not making any

01:06:56.797 --> 01:06:57.610
progress.
 

01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:00.594
Whereas in East Asia,
still a significant dependent

01:07:00.594 --> 01:07:02.565
population,
they haven't stopped having

01:07:02.565 --> 01:07:05.333
children altogether,
but the working age population

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:09.018
is growing half again as fast as
the dependent population,

01:07:09.018 --> 01:07:12.679
that difference is what one,
makes you rich and two,

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:17.048
makes you be rich enough to
save and invest and develop your

01:07:17.048 --> 01:07:17.789
country.
 

01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:22.784
You've again seen this graph,
the difference between East

01:07:22.784 --> 01:07:24.389
Asia and Africa.
 

01:07:24.389 --> 01:07:33.010
That is the main idea that I
wanted to get for you.

01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:36.023
I have to--by the way on your
schedule this lecture was

01:07:36.023 --> 01:07:38.199
supposed to be given by David
Bloom,

01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:40.262
who's a professor at Harvard,
and one of the guys who did a

01:07:40.262 --> 01:07:40.940
lot of this work.
 

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.300
He wasn't able to come so I
used this--he came in the last

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.659
time I gave this class and I
used a lot of the slides that

01:07:47.659 --> 01:07:49.369
are David Bloom's slides.
 

01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:56.039
He's responsible for a fair
chunk of this work.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:05.300
The end of this story is that,
again,

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.804
we talked about when--a long
time ago when I describe

01:08:08.804 --> 01:08:11.416
Algeria's--
how much Algeria has gotten

01:08:11.416 --> 01:08:15.338
their fertility down but their
population is still growing and

01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:19.005
they haven't been able to take
advantage of a reduction in

01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:19.970
fertility.
 

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.488
The same thing happens with
these dependency burden issues,

01:08:23.488 --> 01:08:27.408
because you first have a lot
more children than workers,

01:08:27.408 --> 01:08:31.516
than you stop having children,
and that bulge grows and you

01:08:31.516 --> 01:08:34.279
get a lot more workers than
children.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:38.047
Then those workers start to age
as the population decreases and

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:40.497
levels out,
so now you have the reverse

01:08:40.497 --> 01:08:43.990
situation of a small number of
workers and a large number of

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.819
old people.
 

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:50.586
Always in dependency burden you
should add and old people and as

01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:54.327
your fertility goes does,
your number of children goes

01:08:54.327 --> 01:08:56.010
down, your number of oldsters
goes up,

01:08:56.010 --> 01:09:00.380
so it's not as bad--it's not as
extreme a change as possible.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.952
This would seem to be
called--this is called the

01:09:03.952 --> 01:09:07.448
demographic dividend,
or the demographic bonus,

01:09:07.448 --> 01:09:08.970
this phenomenon.
 

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:13.172
There's a time period when you
can make great economic progress

01:09:13.172 --> 01:09:17.239
and then your people get old and
a lot of people believe that

01:09:17.239 --> 01:09:20.020
Japan is in that situation right
now.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.783
They have a very low birth rate
and the number of old people is

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:25.789
rising,
and whereas in the past,

01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:29.173
old people cost almost nothing
because just a little bit of

01:09:29.173 --> 01:09:30.930
food,
they didn't eat much,

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:34.364
but now with medical costs,
old people require lots of

01:09:34.364 --> 01:09:37.569
money and in the past children
were expensive,

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:40.288
old people were cheap,
now its reversed.

01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:43.177
The things that children use,
clothing comes from China,

01:09:43.177 --> 01:09:45.436
it's very cheap,
food is comparatively cheap

01:09:45.436 --> 01:09:46.538
around the world.
 

01:09:46.538 --> 01:09:48.649
I mean forget the last half
year or something.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:53.480
Children used to be
cheap--children used to be

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.189
expensive;
they're now getting cheaper,

01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:58.170
old people are getting very
expensive.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:02.287
Now the worry is that any
country that goes through a slow

01:10:02.287 --> 01:10:06.551
demographic change and doesn't
arrange its economics and its

01:10:06.551 --> 01:10:10.514
politics to employ the people,
because it doesn't do you any

01:10:10.514 --> 01:10:13.234
good if you have a lot of
workers if they don't have any

01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:13.630
jobs.
 

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:15.712
Latin America,
for instance,

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.490
which is kind of an in between
situation--was very

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.804
protectionist,
and nationalist,

01:10:21.804 --> 01:10:24.350
and I can tell you a story.
 

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:27.493
Bolivia, next door to Peru,
and had so much conflict with

01:10:27.493 --> 01:10:30.805
Peru that they didn't want to
form a common market with Peru

01:10:30.805 --> 01:10:34.118
and they'd rather buy plastic
buckets from Brooklyn and rice

01:10:34.118 --> 01:10:37.204
from China than they would to
trade with their next door

01:10:37.204 --> 01:10:38.158
neighbor.
 

01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:41.490
The story is that the
demographic situation seems to

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:45.475
be one of the major initiators
of these economic miracles that

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:49.328
have been happening around the
world but they can't do it by

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.439
themselves.
 

01:10:50.439 --> 01:10:54.279
There has to be the economic
and political substructure to

01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:56.926
employ these people,
to set them to work,

01:10:56.926 --> 01:10:59.560
and then a country gets rich
and when it gets--

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.262
once it gets rich it gets the
capital that it can keep it

01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:02.649
going.
 

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:05.175
That you now have enough money
to invest and keep going even

01:11:05.175 --> 01:11:07.529
though you may have to spend a
lot on the old folks,

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:11.439
you may be rich enough to
generate the excess wealth to do

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:11.920
that.
 

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:18.828
Next time we'll talk about
economics and the family,

01:11:18.828 --> 01:11:22.644
this has been macro economics,
how economics works on a whole

01:11:22.644 --> 01:11:25.521
region wide thing,
but what its effect is on a

01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:25.979
family.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.882
Prof: So I'm going to
give a short class,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:09.370
what is known a short class,
they call it--it's an old idea.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.050
They used to call it lectio
brevis, short class.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.063
I just want to give you a
little introduction to what the

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:21.807
course will be like and an
introduction also about the

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:26.295
context of--
within which Dante thrives,

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:31.040
Dante grows,
and writes this poem of his.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.668
A poem, that as you know,
is called the Divine

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:34.380
Comedy.
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.340
It's not really the title Dante
gives to the poem.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.830
Dante called the poem simply
"comedy."

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.200
"Divine"
is the adjective,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.370
the epithet that the readers
in--through centuries have

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.926
assigned to it,
to indicate both what struck

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:59.330
them as this sublime quality of
this text,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.719
and also the content.
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.385
It deals, after all,
the fundamental theme of the

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.290
poem is the encounter of a
pilgrim,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.454
an ordinary man,
who you'll see,

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:13.644
lived in the thirteenth century
or the fourteenth century and

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.230
who imagines this journey to
God.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.840
So it's divine also because of
this particular content.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.705
It's the--it's a journey,
it's a quest from nothing less

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:30.188
than seeing God face to face and
come back to talk about it.

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.050
Not just seeing God and be
overwhelmed by it and dazzled by

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.239
it,
as probably is the--what do we

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.676
know and it's most of the--
the tradition of visionary

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:42.391
literature,
this is really about writing

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:45.269
the poem about this fundamental
experience.

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:49.566
So we'll be reading this poem,
and if I had to give you

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:53.864
something of a genre -- it's
very difficult to speak of

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:54.739
genres.
 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:55.640
Is it an epic?
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.819
Is it an autobiography?
 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.410
Is it a romance?
 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.239
I think it's all of the things
above.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.653
It's all of these things and
probably the best way to talk

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:08.110
about it is that it is an
encyclopedia.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.188
What does the word mean?
 

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:14.258
The word means a circle of
knowledge.

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:17.870
It's an old classical idea,
it was made--

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.800
I could tell you it was made
available in times--

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.944
in--by an architect by the name
of Vitruvius wrote actually and

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.270
talked about encyclopedia.
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.098
It really means this,
as I said, the circle of

00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:35.059
knowledge, in the sense that to
know you have to have a point of

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.940
departure.
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.610
And that the point of departure
will take you along all the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.878
various disciplines of the
so-called liberal arts,

00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:47.910
and then they take you right
back to where you started.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.818
The beginning and the end in a
liberal education will have to

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:53.720
coincide.
 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.105
You are going to find out
things that now you will see

00:02:57.105 --> 00:03:00.300
with a different view,
from a different standpoint,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.090
a different perspective.
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.911
Dante writes an encyclopedia,
which also means an ordering of

00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.250
the tradition of exactly the
so-called liberal arts.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.460
What are the liberal arts?
 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.788
Why are they called liberal?
 

00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:17.139
They are called liberal to
distinguish them from the

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.979
so-called mechanical arts.
 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:23.281
This is an old medieval
distinction and they're called

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:28.068
liberal also because the aim of
these arts is to free us.

00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:31.409
It's as if knowledge has in
itself the power to give us some

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.430
kind of freedom.
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.120
Free us from all sorts
of--various sorts of tyranny.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.133
The tyranny of action,
above all, the tyranny of

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:44.788
having to do things with your
hands that will distract you

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:48.060
from the great aims and great
aims are theory,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.860
contemplation, and thinking.
 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.240
The liberal arts,
what are these liberal arts?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.680
The liberal arts are so called
the arts of words;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.293
they distinguish them between
arts of words,

00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.568
and arts of number.
 

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:04.471
The arts of words are the
grammar, fundamental,

00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:09.158
which encompasses also poetry
and history.

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:12.550
They are--they are dialectics
and rhetoric.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.947
Rhetoric, the art of persuasion;
dialectics being the art of

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:21.540
deciding what the truth of a
statement may be.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.480
It's really the most difficult
of these arts.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.259
Then there are the arts of
numbers.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.329
The arts of numbers are
arithmetic, geometry,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.891
music;
it's based on rhythm,

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:34.579
on number, and then astronomy.
 

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.990
The aim of these liberal arts
would be ethics;

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.440
it would be also theology,
metaphysics and then theology.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.062
This is the way the Divine
Comedy is actually

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:48.992
structured as I'm going to show
you as we're going to read

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:49.970
this--the poem.
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.190
The implication of calling
the Divine Comedy an

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.610
encyclopedia is that clearly it
deals with education.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.362
You cannot have an
encyclopedia--you do have the

00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:09.312
Encyclopedia Britannica
which gives you all the possible

00:05:09.312 --> 00:05:12.452
interesting,
important items provided in a

00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:15.653
very disconnected way,
according to the laws of the

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:16.269
alphabet.
 

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:20.365
But the aim of the encyclopedia
is really to educate the

00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:21.110
readers.
 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.223
So, Dante actually shows,
in this sense it's an

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:23.959
autobiography.
 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.550
The poem is an autobiography;
it shows the process by which

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.120
he comes to know the world
around him.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.440
So we are going to talk about
things that have to do with

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.146
politics, that have to do with
questions that Dante raises all

00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:40.149
the time.
 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.079
What is justice in the world?
 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:48.163
How do the claims of justice go
along with the realities of

00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:52.964
passions and conflicting,
the collision of conflicting

00:05:52.964 --> 00:05:55.550
desires,
conflicting parties and so on?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.432
But also, we'll be talking
about ethics,

00:05:59.432 --> 00:06:00.329
agency.
 

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:05.259
Am I--do I know things and
because I know things I'm all

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.458
right, or are my problems a
little bit different because my

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.610
will is really weak?
 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.567
It's an old idea,
the weakness of the will,

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:19.865
and if I know what I should be
doing--we all know we should be

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:20.500
just.
 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.528
That doesn't really make us
just, right?

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:27.716
We have--will be a kind of
frailty, a vulnerability to

00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:32.139
wanting to do things that we
normally should be doing.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.060
We even know that we shouldn't
do them.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.041
We talk of--Dante raises some
of these issues in a very lucid,

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:42.800
and I think,
a most probing manner possible.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.709
Then he goes on writing this
poem,

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.526
which is as you know,
written about going into hell

00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:51.482
literally,
and trying to rectify the

00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:56.548
belief that you can really get
out of it and rearrange the

00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:59.283
old--
your vision about the world and

00:06:59.283 --> 00:07:00.329
about yourself.
 

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:04.281
Because every time you talk
about ethics and every time you

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:07.887
talk about politics,
the real question is who am I

00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:11.468
and what am I doing in order to
come to some kind of

00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:14.560
understanding of the world
around myself.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.629
We'll be talking about some of
these issues in detail and

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.120
reading in a very unassuming way
without any--

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.459
all the various cantos that are
indicated in your--

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.600
in the syllabus.
 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.060
Let me go to the other part,
which is really probably the

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.360
most concrete part.
 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.319
This is--I gave you the general
scheme of the lectures.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:42.442
Let me just talk about the
concrete context of Dante's

00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:46.139
life, the contour of his life.
 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.779
Who is this man?
 

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:52.315
How did he end up writing a
poem that seven centuries or

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:55.569
more after he wrote it,
is still read,

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:00.170
and still been thought of as
one of the major contributions

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.660
that a human being can make to a
culture.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.636
Well he was born,
as you know,

00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:18.910
probably in 1265 in a city
called Florence.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:24.442
A city that,
by the time Dante was of school

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:27.660
age, had 70,000 people.
 

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.434
Seven thousand--these are
little details to impress you

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:34.860
about how crucial,
how important that city was;

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.658
7,000 boys and girls who go to
school;

00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:39.470
public schools were available
to them.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.570
Dante was one of these people.
 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.538
He was born in a family that
was somehow--

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:49.519
he claimed nobility and what
not, but actually was an

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:54.264
impoverished family and he was
even slightly embarrassed by the

00:08:54.264 --> 00:08:56.788
activities of his own father.
 

00:08:56.788 --> 00:08:58.937
He never mentions him,
but we do know by poems that

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:02.418
others had written against him,
attacking him and attacking his

00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:05.663
genealogy,
accusing the father of

00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:11.600
loan--being involved in the loan
and the kind of usury

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.851
activities--
activities of a usurer,

00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.250
lending money at a high,
very high interest and so on.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.023
When he--Dante--two events
happened to him,

00:09:22.023 --> 00:09:25.590
private events happened to him,
when he was a child.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.056
The first is,
by the time he was eight years

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:30.908
old, his mother died.
 

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:34.519
The second, a little bit
connected with it,

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:38.214
is the fact that when he was
nine years old,

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:42.340
he will tell us later,
he met a young woman.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.530
He doesn't even know what her
name is, that's the fiction of

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.514
his own works,
he knew because she actually

00:09:49.514 --> 00:09:52.500
was a neighbor,
he calls her Beatrice.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.360
The way he goes on transferring
all the love that he felt or

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.470
wanted from his mother onto this
young woman we don't know,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.243
unless we were just involved in
some kind of psychoanalytical

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:06.629
speculations about his life.
 

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:11.660
The facts we don't know,
however, he does talk about her

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.678
as if she were a mother to him.
 

00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:18.639
He describes her in the poem in
very maternal language and a

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:23.019
language of great generosity;
the generosity of love actually.

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:27.870
These are the two events--then
he goes to school in Florence.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.423
The school--of all his teachers
he'll have only one that he'll

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.418
really--
will point out and will

00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:37.761
remember forever,
a man by the name of Brunetto

00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:39.730
Latini,
we'll see him later in Hell.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.312
I like--a lot of students they
all want to send their teacher

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:48.590
to hell, but not you of course,
but this was--he does.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.330
Who was this man?
 

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.298
Why was he so important for
Dante?

00:10:54.298 --> 00:11:00.230
Brunetto Latini would call
him--he's still talked about--

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:06.280
if you happen to go to Florence
and you read this kind of

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.888
memorial stones that are all--
are everywhere on the walls of

00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:13.196
the city,
he was one of those who

00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:15.820
civilized the city of Florence.
 

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.740
What was he doing?
 

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.178
What did he do actually?
 

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:22.856
Well he was a rhetorician first
of all, in the mode of

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:26.298
Ciceronian--the Ciceronian
tradition.

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:29.119
A rhetorician,
as we say of men who believed

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:32.070
that politics and rhetoric go
hand in hand.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.457
That rhetoric is the art of
persuasion within the

00:11:36.457 --> 00:11:41.394
parliament, within the streets
of the city, where large

00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:45.509
decisions can be made and can be
reached.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:48.826
This was the essential work of
Brunetto Latini,

00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:52.070
Dante styles himself after
Brunetto Latini.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.678
Because Brunetto Latini was not
only a great teacher,

00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:58.346
he actually translated and
commented works that we have by

00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:01.538
Cicero on rhetorical works of
Cicero.

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:05.100
In the belief that really the
political problems are

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.870
ultimately problems of speech,
problems of argument.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.320
But he also was a traveler.
 

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.451
He went to--we do know that he
went to Toledo,

00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:17.538
the city of Toledo in Spain.
 

00:12:17.538 --> 00:12:26.450
He did bring in translations of
Avveroistic texts.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.788
I will explain all these terms
as we go on.

00:12:28.788 --> 00:12:34.543
Dante admires him especially
because he stands for the sort

00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:40.000
of teacher who gets involved in
political--the political

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.580
realities of Florence.
 

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.320
Dante wants to follow him in
turn.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.120
Eventually, he would meet
Beatrice again,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.389
writes a great poem inspired by
her, which we'll be looking at

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:55.399
next time called the Vita
nuova.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:59.292
The teacher--his teacher
Brunetto Latini will die and

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:02.735
Dante decides to enter--we are
already in 1290,

00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:06.029
decides to enter political life
himself.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:08.558
It was his biggest mistake.
 

00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:13.078
It was his biggest mistake
because political life in

00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:18.217
Florence really meant being in
the throes of harsh partisan

00:13:18.217 --> 00:13:23.269
battles between the so-called
Guelfs and Ghibellines.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.918
The issues are not so clear-cut.
 

00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:30.288
The Guelfs supposedly are those
who really believe in the

00:13:30.288 --> 00:13:32.590
loyalty to the Church.
 

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.726
The others, the Ghibellines,
also believe in the loyalty to

00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:36.428
the empire.
 

00:13:36.428 --> 00:13:40.426
The two institutions of the
time, things are not that

00:13:40.426 --> 00:13:44.269
clear-cut as that--as sharply
separable as that.

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:47.240
We'll talk about some of the
details about this.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.149
But Dante becomes an ambassador
for the city of Florence,

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:53.868
the way Brunetto had become an
ambassador for the city of

00:13:53.868 --> 00:13:56.149
Florence and he goes a little
bit everywhere.

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:59.558
He's sent to the Pope in the
year 1302;

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:03.816
he's sent to the Pope on an
embassy and he never makes it

00:14:03.816 --> 00:14:05.259
back to Florence.
 

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:11.379
Machinations had taken place so
that he would be banned from the

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:12.058
city.
 

00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:15.765
Not only banned from the city,
his property is confiscated and

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:19.379
there is the threat on him,
that should he return and

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:23.389
should he get caught he would
actually be put to death.

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:28.836
The year 1302 is the beginning
of Dante's new education and new

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:29.980
experience.
 

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.272
He goes into exile,
an exile which at the time was

00:14:34.272 --> 00:14:38.126
thought to be,
nothing less than the fiercest

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:40.580
condemnation on anybody.
 

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.364
Because we are--that's the
medieval idea,

00:14:44.364 --> 00:14:49.946
we are--the value of each and
every one of us depends on the

00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:54.110
position that we occupy within
the city.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.455
To be without a city,
not be a holder of a place

00:14:57.455 --> 00:15:00.445
within the city,
means that one is actually

00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:01.298
nothing.
 

00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:05.019
So he goes literally begging
from one city to another.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.460
Maybe he even traveled as far
as Paris,

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.337
we don't know that,
but exile--though it turned out

00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:17.241
to be a harsh punishment,
turned out to be also nothing

00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:22.447
less than a blessing,
a blessing in disguise because

00:15:22.447 --> 00:15:27.812
it removed Dante from any sense
of loyalty to partisan

00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:29.230
viewpoints.
 

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:35.250
He was no longer to be a Guelf
or a Ghibelline,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.750
he was no longer caught in
these internecine wars,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.200
he now became nothing less than
one who could occupy a

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.298
transcendent viewpoint.
 

00:15:46.298 --> 00:15:48.860
This is what the story of
the Divine Comedy is.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.586
How does one go from perceiving
the world that armed oneself in

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:55.491
this partial,
provisional,

00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:58.846
fragmentary manner,
how can one be pulling it

00:15:58.846 --> 00:15:59.990
together?
 

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.764
The Divine Comedy is the
story of exile being the removal

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:09.217
of oneself from the city;
in order to best see what the

00:16:09.217 --> 00:16:11.460
problems of cities can be.
 

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:18.216
He ended his life in the year
1321 in a city called Ravenna

00:16:18.216 --> 00:16:20.778
where he was buried.
 

00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:27.298
So that's--he--the way he wrote
the poem was in exile.

00:16:27.298 --> 00:16:30.759
The poem came out of his
experience of exile.

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:33.904
He begins his life as an exile,
but I think a philosophical

00:16:33.904 --> 00:16:38.451
text called The Banquet,
in the tradition of--well the

00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:42.269
title of the Symposium on
ethics.

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:45.629
He abandons his project,
starts a project on language

00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:49.044
trying to find a unified,
a possibility of unifying all

00:16:49.044 --> 00:16:52.831
the languages of Italy,
writes a political text about

00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:57.389
the necessity of unifying the
world with this empire,

00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:59.691
the monarch,
finishes that,

00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:03.673
but the real process of
unification of all his

00:17:03.673 --> 00:17:08.630
experiences really is with
the Divine Comedy.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:15.140
And we'll be reading that in a
couple of days.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.720
That's all I have to say to you.
 

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.136
Let me see if there are some
questions and then I'll try to

00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:22.279
answer those.
 

00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:26.769
Yes?
 

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:29.529
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:29.529 --> 00:17:30.588
for the final paper?
 

00:17:30.588 --> 00:17:31.848
Prof: What is the
question again?

00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:33.269
Student:  When is the
final paper due?

00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:35.832
Prof: The final paper is
due within two weeks of the end

00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:36.368
of classes.
 

00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:40.430
The question was when is the
final paper due?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.042
Student:  How important
is the knowledge of the Italian

00:17:51.042 --> 00:17:51.690
language?
 

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.756
Prof: How important is
the knowledge of Italian

00:17:55.756 --> 00:17:56.599
language?
 

00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:59.720
The course is in English.
 

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.323
We are reading the translation
with the original text by the

00:18:04.323 --> 00:18:04.868
side.
 

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:07.680
If you can read it in Italian
good.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.213
If you want to write the paper
in Italian you are welcome to do

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:12.355
so,
but the course is going to

00:18:12.355 --> 00:18:16.730
be--we are treating the poem as
if it were an English poem.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.007
After all, as someone says,
Dante's an American poet,

00:18:20.007 --> 00:18:22.150
maybe we could explore that
too.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.579
Other questions?
 

00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:44.109
Okay, we'll see you on Tuesday.

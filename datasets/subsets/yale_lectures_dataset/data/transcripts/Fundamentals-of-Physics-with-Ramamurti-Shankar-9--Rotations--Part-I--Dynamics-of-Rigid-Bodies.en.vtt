00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.504
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:08.800
so this is a new topic called
Physics or Dynamics of Rigid

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.648
Bodies.
So, a rigid body is something

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:15.060
that will not bend,
will not change its shape when

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.232
you apply forces to it,
and one example could be a

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:22.140
dime, a coin,
or a meter stick.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200
Of course, nobody is absolutely
rigid.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.894
You can always bend anything,
but we'll take the

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:32.452
approximation that we have in
our hands, a completely rigid

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:34.568
body.
A technical definition of a

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:37.230
rigid body is that if you pick a
couple of points,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.322
the distance between them does
not change during the motion of

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:44.352
the body.
So, the dynamics of rigid

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:49.120
bodies, in three dimensions,
is fairly complicated,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.264
because what I want you to
imagine now is not a point mass

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:55.240
but some object with some shape,
like this guy.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
You take this;
you throw it up in the air;

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.820
you can see it does something
fairly complicated.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.351
In fact, we can characterize
what it does using two

00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.169
expressions.
I think you can guess what they

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:13.149
are.
One is, if this had been a

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.042
point mass, then the point mass
will just go back and forth or

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.397
up and down.
It will do what's called

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.787
"translations."
It'll go from a place to

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:24.155
another place,
maybe on a straight line,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.582
maybe on a curve.
But as it goes,

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:30.060
the point mass has no further
information;

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.700
you've got to tell me where it
is, and how fast it's moving.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.820
That's the whole story.
But if you have a body like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.464
this, it's not enough to tell me
where it is, because if I throw

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:44.740
this up in the air you can
imagine that as it travels along

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.680
some parabolic path one instant
the eraser may look like this,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.220
the next instant and the eraser
may look like this;

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.269
so, we say that it is
translating and rotating.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:03.013
It's a non-obvious theorem that
anything the body does from one

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:07.834
instant to the next instant can
be achieved by first translating

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:10.544
it,
then doing a slight rotation to

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:13.349
bring it to the configuration
you want.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.580
In other words,
you can go from here to here by

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.389
a translation,
followed by a rotation.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.091
Now, a translation is what
we've been studying all the

00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:26.862
time, because for point
particles there is no notion of

00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:28.971
rotation.
They take a point mass and

00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:30.439
rotate it.
You don't even know it's

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.621
rotating.
It has no internal variables,

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.569
so that was the problem we've
been focusing on,

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.453
but now we're going to enlarge
our study to objects which have

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:42.748
a size and which have a shape,
therefore, which have an

00:02:42.748 --> 00:02:45.049
orientation.
It's not enough to say the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.845
football is here.
The football could be here but

00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:51.030
its long pointy end could be up
to down or side to side.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.829
So, what we want to do is to
break the problem into two

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.102
parts.
We want to focus on a body

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:03.439
which is only rotating but not
translating.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.541
Once we've sharpened our
skills, we will then put back

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.560
the ability of the body to
translate.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.761
So, we're going to focus
initially on a body that cannot

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:16.086
translate.
So, what that means is,

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:19.479
you take the body and you grab
one point in it;

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.300
then, you can ask,
"What can it do if I grab one

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.477
point in it?"
Well, any motion it does will

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:29.110
be such that that point is not
moving.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.576
Now, in three dimensions,
if you take a football and a

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:36.370
certain point is held fixed,
it can gyrate in many ways.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.930
But at any instant you can show
what it'll be doing.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.108
It's to be doing a rotation
around an axis,

00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:46.120
passing through the point where
you're grabbing it,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.059
because if it rotates to an
axis, points on the axis don't

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.205
move, and the point where you're
grabbing it better lie on the

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:54.708
axis.
Now, that's also pretty

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.884
complicated.
You can see why I gave you a

00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:01.449
little precautionary thing.
It's hard to visualize these

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.524
things.
So again, I want to take the

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:06.667
simplest possible problem;
then, make it more and more

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.503
complex.
Well, you might say the

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:11.928
simplest thing you've been doing
all semester long is to take

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:15.735
things in one dimension.
But that turns out to be too

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:18.116
low.
If you're in one dimension and

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:22.267
you've got a rigid body--By the
way, a rigid body means not only

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:25.046
extended but actually rigid.
For example,

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:28.480
if you take a cat or a snake,
a snake you can grab at one

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.854
point but the snake is not
simply doing rotations around

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:34.187
the one point,
right, trying to bite you,

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:37.509
trying to move around;
a snake is not a rigid body.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.149
A dead snake could be a rigid
body.

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.910
A living snake -- definitely
not a rigid body.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.992
Now, you've got to remember
that I've given you a break by

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:49.161
studying rigid bodies,
but real bodies can actually

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:53.170
not only wobble and twist and
turn, they can also vibrate and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.166
they can move their arms around.
That's much more difficult,

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.988
so we won't go there,
and we'll try to take the

00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:02.982
simplest rigid body.
But I said, if I take a rigid

00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:05.875
body in one dimension,
it cannot rotate at all because

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.440
there's not room in one
dimension to rotate.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.006
It can only go back and forth.
So, to show you there is some

00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.808
new possibility,
I have to go at least to two

00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:18.579
dimensions.
Here's one example where one

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.821
dimension's not enough.
So, I'm going to imagine rigid

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.920
bodies, which are living in the
plane of the blackboard.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.514
Now, one way to do that is to
take a piece of metal,

00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:35.779
just cut out a shape,
and that's a rigid body.

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.924
And of course this has a slight
thickness, because anything you

00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:40.750
make of matter has some
thickness,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.339
at least one atom thick,
but imagine that thickness is

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.440
negligible so it's like a piece
of metal,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.569
a piece of foil or something,
but it's rigid,

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.990
and this is the rigid body
we're going to study.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.260
This rigid body can move in the
plane of the blackboard and

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.080
rotate, but we're going to grab
it at one point.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.037
So, let's pick some point here.
If I grab it at that point and

00:06:01.037 --> 00:06:04.339
I ask you, "What can this fellow
do?"

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.160
So, imagine skewering it
through the blackboard,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.560
you say, "Okay,
do whatever you want."

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.562
You realize that all it can do
is to rotate around an axis,

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:20.807
penetrating that point.
So, let's say at t = 0,

00:06:20.807 --> 00:06:25.592
the body looked like this,
a little later it's going to

00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:29.298
look rotated.
I have to tell you what it is

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:32.663
doing at a given instant.
I have to tell you how it's

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:35.157
oriented.
So, what we do for that is,

00:06:35.157 --> 00:06:38.800
we draw through the point of
rotation some line.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.192
You can pick any line you like.
Pick a line like that and we

00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:45.706
say what angle that line makes
with a standard chosen

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:48.410
direction, usually the x
axis.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.621
So, if I give you θ,
I think you'll have to think

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:57.660
about it and you have to agree I
have told you where the body is.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.729
You can reconstruct everything,
right, because that point is

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.340
nailed;
it cannot move.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.455
You take the body;
you turn it by an angle

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:06.725
θ.
In other words,

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:09.279
here is a question.
Suppose you're not in this room;

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:13.150
you're in another room and I
want to tell you what the rigid

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.751
body is doing.
What information do I have to

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:18.319
communicate to you,
without seeing the picture?

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.717
I claim, if I tell you how the
line was drawn in the body,

00:07:21.717 --> 00:07:24.399
which is something you do once
and for all,

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:26.389
a ruled line,
then I say the ruled line makes

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.379
an angle θ with the
x axis.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.189
I believe you can imagine in
another room what this body is

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.096
doing, and that's the meaning of
saying, "I've given complete

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:36.227
information."
Of course, that's not the

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:39.419
complete dynamical information,
because it also depends on how

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.053
fast it's rotating.
But to simply say the analog of

00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:46.818
where the body is in one
dimension is this angle

00:07:46.818 --> 00:07:50.162
θ.
So, what we are going to set

00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:53.533
up, you'll find,
is an analogy between one

00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:58.220
dimensional translation and two
dimensional rotations.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.680
You'll find the analogy is very
helpful.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.615
So, I'm going to use a piece of
the blackboard where I'll keep

00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:08.162
drawing that analogy.
I do this because the number of

00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:12.022
things you have to remember will
be reduced if you map this

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:15.881
problem mathematically to the
problem of translation in one

00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:17.822
dimension.
In other words,

00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:20.273
in one dimension,
when a body is moving,

00:08:20.273 --> 00:08:22.850
x tells you where it is,
right?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.002
I give you a number,
3, or π,

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:26.740
or -14;
you know where it is.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.222
For this rigid body,
living in the plane of the

00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:34.612
blackboard, this angle θ
tells you what the body is

00:08:34.612 --> 00:08:37.049
doing.
So, even though the body is in

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.176
two dimensions,
you need this one angle

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:41.920
θ to tell you what its
orientation is.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.250
You don't need two numbers;
a single number tells you what

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.862
the rigid body is doing.
So a little later,

00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:50.519
it could be rotated by an angle
Δθ.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:55.432
That's the analog of saying it
moved from x to x

00:08:55.432 --> 00:08:58.415
+ Δx.
The first thing you've got to

00:08:58.415 --> 00:09:01.169
do is, how do you want to
measure θ?

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:02.830
For x we know,
we have agreed.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.424
We're going to measure in
meters θ,

00:09:05.424 --> 00:09:08.822
the standard preference for
people at elementary status,

00:09:08.822 --> 00:09:12.524
is to measure it in degrees.
You measure it in degrees and

00:09:12.524 --> 00:09:16.211
when the body completes one full
revolution, you like to say it

00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:18.649
has turned by an angle of 360
degrees.

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:23.482
Now, that is not the preferred
way to measure angles in more

00:09:23.482 --> 00:09:26.503
advanced dynamics.
We're going to use something

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:28.720
else.
You can imagine what it is.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.350
You know what I'm driving at.
aAnybody know where I'm going?

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.370
Students: Radians.
Professor Ramamurti

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.887
Shankar: Radians.
I'm going towards radians,

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:36.001
and you can ask yourself,
why would anybody think of a

00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.279
radian?
What's wrong with 360 degrees?

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.190
I mean, all the textbooks--I
mean, all the novels say,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.430
"When I was going down the
wrong path, then I did a 180."

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.570
Right?
So, everyone knows.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.204
In fact, I saw a book by a
violinist who said,

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:55.889
"I was going down all the wrong
things and I did a 360."

00:09:55.889 --> 00:10:01.232
So, you realize that 360 is not
really a way to reform your

00:10:01.232 --> 00:10:05.929
life, but among the physicists
it struck a chord.

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:10.830
In physics, a 360 is really not
a trivial thing to do.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.236
It turns out,
the particles in the world are

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:15.922
divided into bosons and
fermions, and half of the

00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:19.000
particles are bosons and roughly
half are fermions.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.198
An electron is a fermion;
the light quantum is a boson,

00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:24.347
the photon.
For all the guys who are

00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:27.011
photons, or bosons,
if you turn them by 360,

00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:29.490
they come back to what they're
doing.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.314
An electron,
it turns out,

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:35.108
when you turn it by 360,
all the numbers are going to

00:10:35.108 --> 00:10:39.041
minus those numbers,
and only when you turn by 720,

00:10:39.041 --> 00:10:42.750
you'll come back to technically
what you're doing.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.490
So, it's quite possible this
person had in mind the behavior;

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.784
maybe she was a fermion,
but that's what it said,

00:10:49.784 --> 00:10:52.064
"I did a 360."
I've gone through a 360 many

00:10:52.064 --> 00:10:55.202
times, so if you use it you
better back it up with the kind

00:10:55.202 --> 00:10:58.503
of information I gave otherwise
you're just off by a factor of

00:10:58.503 --> 00:11:01.159
two.
Anyway, 360 is very nice.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.659
I think the Babylonians liked
360 for a lot of reasons.

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:05.570
It's divisible by a whole bunch
of numbers.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.960
It's easy to partition into
smaller and smaller pieces.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.790
I believe, in some engineering
circles, a circle is 400 and

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.960
something else,
some other engineering degree.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.490
So, you can decide what a
circle is, but we like radian.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.769
So, let's ask,
"Why do we like a radian?"

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:24.592
For that purpose,
I want you to take a point

00:11:24.592 --> 00:11:28.769
here, at a distance r
from the center,

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:32.817
and let it move to a new
location with an angle

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.350
Δθ.
You agree that if the rigid

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.269
body is rotating,
this guy will be traversing a

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:44.132
circle of radius r.
Because it's a rigid body,

00:11:44.132 --> 00:11:46.649
it cannot change the distance
from this point.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:50.704
So, we're going around in a
circle, and I'm asking you how

00:11:50.704 --> 00:11:54.654
big is that segment,
that arc length ΔS that

00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:58.116
it has traveled,
when it's rotated by an angle

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:01.632
Δθ.
So, one way to calculate that

00:12:01.632 --> 00:12:05.380
is to say look,
if I did a full circle I'd have

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.192
done 2πR.
r is the distance of

00:12:09.192 --> 00:12:12.909
this point in the rigid body
from the center.

00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:16.868
I haven't gone a distance
2πr but I've gone

00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:21.380
Δθ, so the fraction of
the circle I've covered is

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.101
Δθ over 360 if
θ is measured in

00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:27.856
degrees;
so, let me indicate that in

00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:34.585
this fashion.
So, we can write π

00:12:34.585 --> 00:12:42.720
over180 Δθ times
r.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:50.763
If you measured θ in
degrees, this is what you have

00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:54.775
to do to convert an angular
traverse to an actual distance

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:58.925
along the tangent to the circle.
The linear distance you travel

00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:01.456
is connected with the angle by
which you rotate,

00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:04.471
by the distance r from
the center, and this number

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.064
here.
So, people say,

00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:10.280
"Look, why don't we make life
easy by calling θ times

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:17.580
π /180 as a new angle."
And let's call it Δθ

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.622
times r.
So, Δθ, without any little

00:13:22.622 --> 00:13:26.870
zero on top of it,
stands for radians from now on,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.709
and it's related to θ,
so if you ignore the

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.890
Δ's, θ itself is
θ in degrees,

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.410
π/180.

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:44.484
Then, the advantage is the
distance you travel -- linear

00:13:44.484 --> 00:13:48.243
distance you travel -- bears a
simple relation to the angle you

00:13:48.243 --> 00:13:51.599
travel,
by the arm length r from

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.379
the center.
So, you don't have to carry

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:57.924
this 180 and π and
everything, you can write the

00:13:57.924 --> 00:14:00.161
simple result.
But now, when you do this,

00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:02.488
you are measuring it in
radians, so you've got to have

00:14:02.488 --> 00:14:05.436
an idea how big is a radian.
Well, a full circle,

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:09.255
if you go a full circle;
the distance you travel should

00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:13.110
be 2πr so a full circle
will Δθ = 2π.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.160
So, a circle is worth
2π radians;

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.784
2π is like 6.
So, one radian is roughly 1/6

00:14:19.784 --> 00:14:24.097
of 360, which is 60 degrees.
The real answer is close to

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:27.191
58-something degrees.
It looks like an odd thing to

00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:29.004
pick.
It's odd only if you start with

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.617
360 degrees.
But if you met people from an

00:14:31.617 --> 00:14:34.277
alien culture,
you just got to go to the

00:14:34.277 --> 00:14:38.369
supermarket to run into these
people, those people may not be

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:41.916
using 360 at all;
360 is a human artifact,

00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:46.519
nothing special about 360
that's independent of our own

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:49.466
culture or biases.
It may be connected to how many

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:51.533
fingers we have.
It may be connected to how long

00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:53.641
a year is, and so on.
But there's nothing natural

00:14:53.641 --> 00:14:55.905
about the number 360.
2π on the other hand,

00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:58.799
I believe, would be discovered
in any advanced civilization.

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.894
If you haven't figured out
π, you're not an

00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:03.259
advanced civilization.
If you haven't figured out 2,

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:05.171
you're way behind.
So, you know 2,

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:08.781
and you know π,
and that's what other cultures

00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:12.050
and other planets and galaxies
will be using.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.656
That's the unit we like to use.
You'll find,

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:17.093
over and over,
people using units which are

00:15:17.093 --> 00:15:18.706
natural to us.
But later on,

00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:21.405
if you want to communicate with
people in another planet,

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:23.429
you will have to use different
lengths.

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:25.842
For example,
the height of a human or the

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:29.220
length of Napoleon's arm,
they're not very good units,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.276
because if you don't have a
Napoleon in your background you

00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:32.659
don't know what you're talking
about.

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:36.364
But if you measure distances in
how big it is in terms of a

00:15:36.364 --> 00:15:38.982
hydrogen atom,
hydrogen atoms all over the

00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:42.240
universe, that's a natural
length scale to use.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.500
This was a very popular issue
in the old days.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.049
When they sent off a rocket or
they buried something

00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:50.049
underground for aliens to find
out, you want to show how tall

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.964
we are;
no use giving the answer in

00:15:51.964 --> 00:15:55.033
meters or feet or anything.
But if you can somehow relate

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.429
your size, and the size of a
hydrogen atom,

00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:00.166
then that number will make
sense to people in all

00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:02.336
civilizations,
because hydrogen atoms

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.053
conveniently are manufactured
and scattered all over the

00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:07.029
universe and they have the same
size.

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.403
Okay anyway,
that's a long thing about

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:12.289
radians, that's why we like to
use radians.

00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:16.559
You have to know a few popular
angles in radian measure.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.440
I'll be using only radians most
of the time.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.549
You've got to know a circle is
2π;

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:25.017
π is a half a circle,
and π/2 is a quarter of

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:28.600
a circle and when you are by 90
degrees that is π/2;

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.990
that's something you should
know.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.409
Once you write it this
way--Let's get another result

00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:38.073
that's very useful.
Take the distance it travels

00:16:38.073 --> 00:16:41.760
along the tangents by the time
over which it does that.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.850
This is the actual tangential
speed, or the magnitude of the

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.010
velocity in the tangential
direction.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.945
I think you all agree with that;
that's what you and I would

00:16:56.945 --> 00:16:58.923
mean by speed.
If at an instant,

00:16:58.923 --> 00:17:02.320
this piece of the sample just
broke and flew off,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.940
it'll keep flying with that
speed.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.236
This thing, we have a symbol
for it, ω,

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:13.346
and ω is called the
angular velocity,

00:17:13.346 --> 00:17:17.270
and is measured in radians per
second.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:26.150
So, you can calculate angular
velocity for various things.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.602
For example,
what's the angular velocity of

00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:30.880
the Moon as it goes around the
Earth?

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.106
Well, the angular velocity will
be one revolution every 28 days,

00:17:36.106 --> 00:17:38.056
right?
One revolution is 2π

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:42.692
radians.
At 28 days you do 28 times 24

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:45.954
times 3600;
it's that many radians per

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:48.249
second.
Or there's a chainsaw blade,

00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:52.037
and the chainsaw is spinning at
some number of rpm -- maybe

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:55.304
3,000 rpm -- you can take
revolutions per minute to

00:17:55.304 --> 00:17:58.505
revolutions per second,
but you've got to remember

00:17:58.505 --> 00:18:01.509
every revolution is 2π
radians.

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:05.752
So, the angular velocity of a
blade that's spinning with

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.530
frequency f is
2πf.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.069
You understand that?
f is the number of

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:15.647
complete revolutions it does.
Therefore, if you pick a point

00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:18.910
on it, it does a traverse of
2πf radians.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:24.220
So, the dictionary has got a
second member here,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.529
which is the velocity,
which is dx/dt,

00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:33.871
is now replaced by angular
velocity, which is

00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:39.920
dθ/dt.
This is an analogy, by the way.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.805
This is to help you say
ω is like what velocity

00:18:42.805 --> 00:18:45.905
used to be in the old days when
things were moving back and

00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:47.645
forth.
But now they're going round and

00:18:47.645 --> 00:18:49.630
round, but even here there's a
notion of velocity,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.595
but it's not in meters per
second, it's measured in radians

00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:54.648
per second.
Now, here is something you guys

00:18:54.648 --> 00:18:56.529
have got to keep very clear in
your head.

00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:59.009
I can only mention it to you
but I cannot do it for you.

00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:03.216
This ω is an analogous
thing to ordinary velocity but

00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:05.740
it's also an actual velocity
here,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.640
the good old velocity,
that's the tangential velocity

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.539
of points which are part of a
rotating rigid body.

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:14.333
That is not part of my
dictionary but it's a very

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:17.880
useful result to know.
The tangential velocity is the

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.966
angular velocity times the
distance of that point from the

00:19:21.966 --> 00:19:26.055
center of the rotation.
So the rigid body as a whole

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:29.780
has a single angular velocity.
That's what it means to be

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.369
rigid.
The whole thing is rotating.

00:19:31.369 --> 00:19:34.563
You cannot say the angular
velocity is so and so here and

00:19:34.563 --> 00:19:36.905
so and so there;
it's the property of the entire

00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:38.435
body.
With a linear velocity,

00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:41.938
it's not the same everywhere;
points near here in the same

00:19:41.938 --> 00:19:44.828
time go that far,
and points near here in the

00:19:44.828 --> 00:19:48.443
same time go that far.
Therefore, the linear velocity

00:19:48.443 --> 00:19:51.939
increases from the center.
The angular velocity is

00:19:51.939 --> 00:19:55.603
constant, and a rigid body
cannot have two angular

00:19:55.603 --> 00:19:58.153
velocities.
It can have only one angular

00:19:58.153 --> 00:20:00.655
velocity.
Okay, then, what we do is we

00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:04.796
say okay, let's take a problem
where the angular velocity is

00:20:04.796 --> 00:20:08.124
itself changing.
Fine, that's the analog of

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:12.955
saying there is a rate of change
of velocity, and here we have a

00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:16.999
quantity called α,
which is the rate of change of

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:19.911
angular velocity,
or the second rate of change of

00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:22.930
the angle,
and that's denoted by α.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.928
So, if you took one of these
rotating circular saws,

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:32.539
and it was spinning at a
certain speed,

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:35.404
and due to friction,
let us say, it was slowing

00:20:35.404 --> 00:20:38.829
down, or when you turn on the
motor it's speeding up,

00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:42.163
suppose you just turned down
the saw motor and it's speeding

00:20:42.163 --> 00:20:45.755
up in its rotation,
you've got to be very clear

00:20:45.755 --> 00:20:50.387
that the acceleration of
parts--This is the saw blade

00:20:50.387 --> 00:20:54.621
okay?
I'm trying to draw for you one

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:59.200
of these saw blades and it's
spinning.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.269
If you pick a point,
say on the circumference;

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:04.792
you remember long back we
learned, even if it's going at a

00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:07.450
constant speed,
a constant angular speed,

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.530
it has a tangential velocity,
which is ω times

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.025
r.
And because of that,

00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:13.951
it'll have an acceleration
towards the center,

00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:19.903
centripetal acceleration,
which is v^(2)/r and you

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:26.631
can write it as ω^(2)r.
That's one acceleration it has

00:21:26.631 --> 00:21:29.059
even if it's spinning at a
steady rate.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:32.796
But I'm saying it can also have
a tangential acceleration,

00:21:32.796 --> 00:21:36.467
if on top of everything else,
the angular speed itself is

00:21:36.467 --> 00:21:39.423
changing.
Well, let's take our time

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:42.799
digesting that.
This is not too hard but I want

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:46.138
you guys to understand.
If it's spinning at a steady

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.674
ω, we have learned
anything going in a circle has

00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:53.400
an old-fashioned linear
acceleration towards the center,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.152
which is v^(2)/r.
But we have realized v in the

00:21:56.152 --> 00:21:58.696
tangential direction is
ωr, so if you put that

00:21:58.696 --> 00:22:01.577
in -- if you want you can call
it v tangential -- that

00:22:01.577 --> 00:22:04.930
gives me ω^(2)r,
that's just the v^(2)/r.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.173
But if you put the brakes on
this by speeding it up or

00:22:08.173 --> 00:22:11.477
slowing down it'll have in
addition, an acceleration in

00:22:11.477 --> 00:22:14.281
this direction.
So, the acceleration of a point

00:22:14.281 --> 00:22:17.140
on the edge or anywhere else can
have two components.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.747
The tangential one will be
there only if you speed up or

00:22:21.747 --> 00:22:25.598
slow down the rotating disk,
but the radial one will always

00:22:25.598 --> 00:22:27.160
be there as long as it's
rotating.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.663
Okay, once you've got this
dictionary, you can have a whole

00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:36.656
bunch of analogous quantities.
For example,

00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:41.601
if you focus on problems where
the body has a constant angle of

00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:45.109
acceleration α,
what can you say?

00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:50.010
Well, you can already say that
θ would be the

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.099
θ_0 +
ω_0 + ½ αt^(2).

00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:59.730
This is because θ is
behaving just like x.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.613
If x had a constant
acceleration a,

00:23:02.613 --> 00:23:05.976
we all knew x was equal
to the starting x +

00:23:05.976 --> 00:23:09.220
initial velocity times time plus
½ at^(2).

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.980
Similarly, the angle by which
it rotates will be the initial

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.279
angle.
The initial angular velocity

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.730
times t plus something
involving t^(2).

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.547
This is only if α is a
constant, just like I hope you

00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:26.110
guys know this is true only if
a is a constant.

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:36.929
All right, now I'm going to
pursue the analogy and ask what

00:23:36.929 --> 00:23:42.960
is the kinetic energy of a rigid
body, when it's rotating?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.946
Yes?
Student: Could you

00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:47.168
please explain [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:47.168 --> 00:23:49.353
Shankar: Here?
Student: No,

00:23:49.353 --> 00:23:51.460
the acceleration with
α.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.690
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.130
Student: Right next to
the saw blade.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.910
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh here?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.299
Student: Up.
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:59.299 --> 00:24:01.009
Shankar: This one?
Student: Yeah.

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:03.063
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:24:03.063 --> 00:24:05.220
I'm saying, if you have a
rotating disk,

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.621
take any point on the rotating
disk, even if the disk is going

00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:11.893
at constant angular velocity,
it has a tangential velocity,

00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:14.980
and the direction of the
velocity is constantly changing.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.456
This is the oldest thing we
learned, so it has an

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:20.726
acceleration towards the center.
But it's not an angular

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:23.257
acceleration;
it just a standard acceleration

00:24:23.257 --> 00:24:25.850
towards the center of anything
going in a circle.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.788
That's always going to be there.
But on top of it,

00:24:28.788 --> 00:24:32.049
if you speed up or slow down
this rotation rate of the disk,

00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:34.887
you'll also have a tangential
acceleration,

00:24:34.887 --> 00:24:37.320
which is α times
r.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.796
Not clear yet, or?
That's the acceleration lay

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:48.180
people would know.
If you're on a rotating

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.858
platform and somebody sped up
the rotation rate,

00:24:50.858 --> 00:24:53.079
you will notice you're going
faster.

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:55.250
That's the acceleration in the
tangential direction.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.875
The acceleration towards the
center is a more sophisticated

00:24:57.875 --> 00:25:00.093
one we have learned,
and it's due to the fact that

00:25:00.093 --> 00:25:01.950
velocity's a vector and not a
scalar.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.020
So, if the direction is
changing there is an

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.862
acceleration we associate with
that, and it's as real as any

00:25:06.862 --> 00:25:09.836
other acceleration;
it needs a force to make it

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:12.079
happen.
Maybe the better way to ask you

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:17.172
is this.
Suppose this little speck here

00:25:17.172 --> 00:25:21.358
is you, okay?
You happen to be stuck on a

00:25:21.358 --> 00:25:25.358
rotating chainsaw blade,
and you're clinging to it for

00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:28.295
dear life.
What force do you have to apply

00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:30.440
to stay onto that rotating
blade?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.462
This may not happen to you and
me but if you're in organized

00:25:34.462 --> 00:25:37.529
crime this is not a very unusual
situation.

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:40.688
You can find yourself
intermingled with all kinds of

00:25:40.688 --> 00:25:44.279
machinery, and you want to know
what do I do to stay on.

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:46.200
Well, Newton tells you the
answer.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.493
Newton says,
if you want to be on this

00:25:48.493 --> 00:25:51.779
rotating chainsaw blade,
your acceleration towards the

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:55.029
center has to be paid for,
and if the blade is picking up

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:56.790
speed, that's got to be paid for
too.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.205
That's the net acceleration;
that, times your mass will be

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:02.559
the force that has to be applied
to you.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:07.499
So, you will cling onto it with
that force, and that force will

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:12.039
be applied in turn by the third
law by the disk on you.

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:15.200
For example,
suppose it's a top view of a

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.397
rotating platform.
You're just standing there and

00:26:18.397 --> 00:26:20.741
the platform is rotating.
You can ask,

00:26:20.741 --> 00:26:25.369
"What frictional force do I
need to stay on the platform?"

00:26:25.369 --> 00:26:27.609
Well, you need the force to
provide you with ma,

00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:29.890
and I'm telling you that your
a has two parts.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.679
Even if the merry-go-round is
spinning at a steady rate,

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:35.114
you will need to have a
frictional force directed

00:26:35.114 --> 00:26:37.599
towards the center to bend you
into a circle.

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:39.895
Now, if on top of it,
the merry-go-round starts

00:26:39.895 --> 00:26:42.289
increasing its speed,
or decreasing its speed.

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:46.266
We'll also need a tangential
component of force to provide

00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:51.372
the tangential acceleration.
Okay, now this is kinematics of

00:26:51.372 --> 00:26:55.357
rotation at constant angular
acceleration,

00:26:55.357 --> 00:27:00.119
which is identical to this one
mathematically,

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.351
because mathematically,
if you know

00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:04.779
d^(2)θ/dt^(2) is
α,

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:08.369
the answer is just like
d^(2)x/dt^(2) = a.

00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:11.089
You change the symbols,
you get the same answer.

00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:13.410
So, you can imagine a variety
of problems I don't feel like

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.032
doing.
I think you guys can easily do

00:27:15.032 --> 00:27:16.559
with that.
I'd rather focus on more

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.286
difficult ones.
For example,

00:27:18.286 --> 00:27:21.622
a chainsaw blade,
spinning at 3,600 rpm,

00:27:21.622 --> 00:27:25.130
is decelerated at some rate
α.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.039
How long does it take to come
to rest?

00:27:27.039 --> 00:27:31.174
Well, for that you will write
the second formula,

00:27:31.174 --> 00:27:34.190
ω = ω_0 +
αt.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.450
That's the analog of v =
v_0 + at.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.863
And you start with some
ω_0,

00:27:39.863 --> 00:27:42.428
you put on the brakes;
α it's a negative

00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:45.240
number, you see at what time
this ω goes to 0;

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.785
that's when it'll stop.
Another result which I will use

00:27:49.785 --> 00:27:53.775
today in fact is the following:
ω^(2) =

00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:57.005
ω_0^(2)
+2α(θ -

00:27:57.005 --> 00:28:02.041
θ_0).
That is the analog of v^(2)

00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:07.009
= v_0^(2) +
2a(x - x_0).

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:10.351
This says that if the body has
an acceleration α,

00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:12.440
then it's going to pick up
speed,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.698
of course, and the final speed
squared is related to the

00:28:16.698 --> 00:28:21.421
initial angular velocity squared
plus 2 times the acceleration

00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:24.780
times the angle rotated.
So, this is the analogy,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.259
so we don't have to reinvent
all of these things.

00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:29.558
They just come from the fact
that things which are

00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:32.420
mathematically the same have the
same mathematical results.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.069
They obey the same equation;
they have the same results.

00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:40.240
All right, now let's find the
kinetic energy of a rigid body.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.316
It's got mass,
and if it's spinning,

00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:45.282
all the little atoms making up
the body are moving,

00:28:45.282 --> 00:28:48.069
and they've got their own ½
mv^(2).

00:28:48.069 --> 00:28:50.345
And we want to ask,
"What is the total ½

00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:53.019
mv^(2) summed over all
the particles?"

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:56.240
For that purpose,
it's convenient to take the

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.661
following simpler rigid body.
We take a rigid body by taking

00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:05.250
a mass m_1 at a
distance r_1,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.742
connected to some central hub
with a massless rod,

00:29:09.742 --> 00:29:14.609
and you take another mass,
and you take a third mass.

00:29:14.609 --> 00:29:16.760
This is m_2,
at a distance

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.320
r_2,
there's m_3,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.060
at a distance
r_3,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.551
and so on.
You can make a rigid body by

00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.700
modeling it in this simple
fashion.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.717
If you are a little more
abstract, you can take a

00:29:28.717 --> 00:29:31.609
continuous rigid body and do the
same thing;

00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:33.299
but let's start with the simple
thing.

00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:35.560
Here's a rigid body,
three rigid rods with masses

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.680
m_1,
m_2,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.791
m_3,
and it's nailed here and there

00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:43.109
is a skewer going through the
board,

00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:46.109
and the things can only rotate
around that.

00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:51.289
By the way, I should tell you
the convention for ω.

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.162
In one dimensional motion,
velocity is positive,

00:29:54.162 --> 00:29:57.585
you're moving to the right,
and negative you're moving to

00:29:57.585 --> 00:29:59.595
the left.
With angular velocity,

00:29:59.595 --> 00:30:02.856
we've got to have a convention
on what's positive and what's

00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:04.923
negative.
This thing which is spinning

00:30:04.923 --> 00:30:07.230
can only spin clockwise or
counter-clockwise.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:11.846
It turns out to be that
ω is positive for

00:30:11.846 --> 00:30:16.572
counter-clockwise.
That just happens to be the

00:30:16.572 --> 00:30:20.315
convention people use.
In fact, you notice the way I

00:30:20.315 --> 00:30:22.978
drew the rigid body when I did
Δθ, I had rotating

00:30:22.978 --> 00:30:25.858
counter-clockwise.
That's the preferred direction

00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:29.023
for measuring the angle
θ from the x

00:30:29.023 --> 00:30:32.864
axis.
Okay now, let's take this rigid

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:35.756
body.
It is rotating with a common

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:38.195
angular velocity.
I hope you all understand

00:30:38.195 --> 00:30:39.589
that's the meaning of being
rigid.

00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:42.369
So, everybody's got the same
angular velocity ω.

00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:45.539
So, what's the kinetic energy
of this object?

00:30:45.539 --> 00:30:50.640
Well, it's the kinetic energy
of each mass summed over all the

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.399
masses i,
m_iv

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:57.663
_i^(2).
Now, what's the velocity of

00:30:57.663 --> 00:31:00.277
each object?
If you take this body,

00:31:00.277 --> 00:31:03.698
m_1,
its velocity is necessarily

00:31:03.698 --> 00:31:07.332
perpendicular to the line
joining it to the point of

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:10.549
rotation.
This one is moving this way;

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:13.665
it cannot move in the line
joining it, because if it is

00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:15.914
it's not a rigid body.
For a rigid body,

00:31:15.914 --> 00:31:18.666
all distances are maintained.
So, you don't come near the

00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:20.710
center and you don't go far from
the center.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.579
So, all you can do is rotate
around the center.

00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:26.162
So, the velocity of this guy,
v_1 =

00:31:26.162 --> 00:31:29.632
ωr_1.
The velocity of this guy,

00:31:29.632 --> 00:31:31.927
v_2,
is the same

00:31:31.927 --> 00:31:34.580
ωr_2,
and so on.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.150
So, you can then add it all up.
And what do you get?

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:42.677
You get ½ sum over i
m_ir

00:31:42.677 --> 00:31:48.381
_i^(2)ω^(2).
And you have to do the

00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:52.176
summation over all the bodies.
In my example,

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:55.213
the summation goes from 1 to 3.
You may have 1 to infinity,

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.240
and 1 to a million;
it doesn't matter.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.470
That's the kinetic energy.
You guys follow this?

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.220
This is not a new kinetic
energy;

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.404
this is what we know to be
kinetic energy,

00:32:05.404 --> 00:32:08.600
just ½ mv^(2) for every
piece that makes up the rigid

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.932
body.
For convenience,

00:32:09.932 --> 00:32:13.077
I've taken the rigid body to be
made up of a discreet set of

00:32:13.077 --> 00:32:14.753
masses.
But now, if you notice,

00:32:14.753 --> 00:32:17.041
as you go from 1 to 3,
m_1 and

00:32:17.041 --> 00:32:19.726
m_2 and
m_3 are three

00:32:19.726 --> 00:32:22.268
different numbers.
We don't know what the masses

00:32:22.268 --> 00:32:23.174
are.
r_1 and

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:24.668
r_2 and
r_3 are three

00:32:24.668 --> 00:32:26.069
different numbers.
We don't know;

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.725
each one could be at a
different distance from the

00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:29.276
origin.
But the ω doesn't have

00:32:29.276 --> 00:32:31.238
a subscript i;
there's nothing called

00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:33.670
ω for this one and
ω for that one.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.349
There's only one ω for
everything.

00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:38.380
So, you can pull it out of the
sum and write it this way.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:51.078
Then, the answer we write as
identical to ½ Iω^(2),

00:32:51.078 --> 00:32:56.470
and we give this I a
name;

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.670
I is called the moment
of inertia.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:08.931
So, continuing with the
analogy, this board is going to

00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:13.252
be used for analogy,
we used to have K = ½

00:33:13.252 --> 00:33:19.221
mv^(2).
Yet, we can have K = ½

00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:28.130
Iω^(2) and I is
called the moment of inertia.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.272
So, the moment of inertia is
determined not only by the

00:33:31.272 --> 00:33:34.589
masses that make up the body but
how far they are from the

00:33:34.589 --> 00:33:36.739
center.
If all the masses just fell on

00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:39.105
top of the center,
the body would have no moment

00:33:39.105 --> 00:33:40.960
of inertia.
It'll weigh the same;

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.839
the moment of inertia would
vanish.

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:45.720
And likewise,
if the mass is spread out the

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.338
moment of inertia is more.
For example,

00:33:48.338 --> 00:33:51.655
if I'm standing around here,
and you come along and decide

00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.852
to spin me,
I'm standing like this,

00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:56.257
you try to spin me,
I stick my hands out,

00:33:56.257 --> 00:33:59.443
my moment of inertia has
changed because the sum of my

00:33:59.443 --> 00:34:02.809
mass now is further away from
the axis of rotation.

00:34:02.809 --> 00:34:06.759
So, the moment of inertia
depends on the arrangement of

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:08.949
the masses.
We're taking a rigid body;

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.659
it's not like ice dancers who
do this.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.929
We're talking about a rigid
body;

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:17.789
therefore, the moment of
inertia is constant.

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:22.949
But it requires a calculation
to find the moment of inertia.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:24.800
And here's another important
thing.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.546
If I decide to rotate the body
about a new location,

00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:32.072
say around this point,
the moment of inertia will

00:34:32.072 --> 00:34:34.135
change,
because all the distances

00:34:34.135 --> 00:34:36.689
r will change.
The moment of inertia--If

00:34:36.689 --> 00:34:38.660
someone says,
"Here are the masses,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.322
here's where they are,
please find me the moment of

00:34:41.322 --> 00:34:43.139
inertia," you will say,
"I cannot do it."

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.932
You will say,
"I cannot do it until you tell

00:34:45.932 --> 00:34:49.570
me the point around which you
plan to rotate the body.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.170
Unless that is given I cannot
tell you what the moment of

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.954
inertia is."
Therefore, the moment of

00:34:55.954 --> 00:35:00.193
inertia is with respect to a
point, and there's nothing

00:35:00.193 --> 00:35:04.040
called the mass with the respect
to the point.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.810
The mass is just the mass.
The moment of inertia depends

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.610
on the point around which you're
computing the moment of inertia;

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.627
it's a variable.
It's also worth knowing that if

00:35:12.627 --> 00:35:15.989
the body's being rotated about
mass m_3,

00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.830
then m_3
doesn't contribute to the moment

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.929
of inertia;
it's out.

00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:21.840
Anything sitting on the axis
doesn't contribute.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.738
Things which are further away
contribute more in proportion to

00:35:24.738 --> 00:35:27.732
their mass, in proportion to the
square of the distance from the

00:35:27.732 --> 00:35:32.219
axis.
So, this is my dictionary here.

00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:34.699
So, who is playing the role of
mass?

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.889
The mass is played by moment of
inertia.

00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:40.741
It's got units of kilogram,
meters squared,

00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:43.389
and no one has given a name for
that.

00:35:43.389 --> 00:35:46.791
For example,
Newton times meter is called a

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.125
joule.
You can ask,

00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:50.469
well this is kilogram times
meter squared,

00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:52.469
maybe it's named after
somebody.

00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:54.824
So far, it's not been named
after anybody,

00:35:54.824 --> 00:35:57.180
it is just called Newton meter
squared.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:05.156
So, this is going to be the
analog of mass in our world of

00:36:05.156 --> 00:36:06.500
rotations.
You remember,

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.724
in the world of rotation
[correction: should have said

00:36:07.724 --> 00:36:09.688
"translation"],
we define something called

00:36:09.688 --> 00:36:12.070
momentum, which is mass times
velocity.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.188
Here, we are going to call
something called angular

00:36:15.188 --> 00:36:18.369
momentum is going to be I
times ω.

00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:20.930
This L is called the
angular momentum.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:35.534
One extremely important point
that you guys should notice is

00:36:35.534 --> 00:36:39.062
that all the concepts I'm using,
like mass and energy,

00:36:39.062 --> 00:36:43.480
they are the same old concepts
that we learned earlier on.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.022
The fact that it's a rotating
body doesn't change anything,

00:36:47.022 --> 00:36:48.716
okay?
Kinetic energy still means the

00:36:48.716 --> 00:36:49.809
same;
this K,

00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:53.409
though it looks so different,
is in fact the ½ mv^(2)

00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:56.590
of every part of the body,
summed over the bodies.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.659
All right, so this L is
called angular momentum.

00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:02.635
It'll take a while to get used
to this, but right now it's the

00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:05.610
product of the moment of inertia
and the angle of velocity.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.980
So, now we are looking for the
most important equation in

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.790
mechanics, which is F =
ma.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.949
That's going to be equal to
some mystery object.

00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:22.750
Now, you should be able to
guess what goes on the

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.150
right-hand side,
okay?

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.514
You should know by now,
by analogy, it can be written

00:37:27.514 --> 00:37:29.519
as dL/dt,
if you like,

00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:32.126
the rate of change of momentum,
or it can be written as

00:37:32.126 --> 00:37:34.460
I times α;
it doesn't matter.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.497
I hope you understand that if
you take rate of change of

00:37:37.497 --> 00:37:39.429
momentum, you will get
ma,

00:37:39.429 --> 00:37:41.518
because when you take the
derivative, m is not

00:37:41.518 --> 00:37:42.873
changing.
Likewise here,

00:37:42.873 --> 00:37:46.133
if you take dL/dt,
I is not changing,

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:49.981
ω is changing to give
you the dω/dt which is

00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:52.171
α.
I is not changing

00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:55.301
because as the body rotates of
course particles in the body are

00:37:55.301 --> 00:37:57.597
moving around,
but their distance from the

00:37:57.597 --> 00:37:59.460
point of rotation is not
changing.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.643
Even though the bodies are
moving to new locations,

00:38:02.643 --> 00:38:06.590
the r^(2) is the same,
because they're just rotating.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.021
That's why in the time
derivative you don't have to

00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:11.550
take the time derivative of the
moment of inertia.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:16.327
But we don't know who's going
to play the role on the

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.440
left-hand side,
okay?

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.207
So, we're going to find that.
We're going to find out the

00:38:21.207 --> 00:38:24.644
analog of that.
So, I'm going to tell you there

00:38:24.644 --> 00:38:29.560
are many ways to find this out.
It's a lot more subtle than

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.000
generally appreciated,
on what the correct law is.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.043
You can hear the law stated
quite often, but some of the

00:38:37.043 --> 00:38:38.980
reasoning behind it is
incorrect.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.630
So, let me tell you one way to
get to the law.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.769
I hope you know what I'm
looking at.

00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:49.693
I'm trying to find out what is
the entity that is possible for

00:38:49.693 --> 00:38:52.329
the rate of change of angular
momentum,

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:56.039
or what's the analog of the
left-hand side for ma.

00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:58.070
I know the right-hand side is
Iα.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.460
By analogy, who's on the
left-hand side?

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.534
First of all,
it's pretty clear that if you

00:39:02.534 --> 00:39:04.856
want the angular momentum of the
body to change,

00:39:04.856 --> 00:39:07.545
ω has to change.
You can see if something's

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:10.458
spinning around at some fixed
ω, you want to change

00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:12.969
it, you've got to push or pull
or do something.

00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:14.775
So obviously,
you're going to apply a force,

00:39:14.775 --> 00:39:17.420
but the thing that comes on the
left-hand side is not simply the

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.562
force but something else and
we'll find out what the

00:39:19.562 --> 00:39:21.735
something is.
And that's done by the

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:24.797
following device.
I'm going to use the good old

00:39:24.797 --> 00:39:28.940
Work Energy Theorem that says:
when the force acts on a body,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.948
the work that it does,
which is the force times the

00:39:33.948 --> 00:39:38.856
distance it travels,
is equal to the change in the

00:39:38.856 --> 00:39:40.760
kinetic energy.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.755
That is the standard Work
Energy Theorem that we

00:39:48.755 --> 00:39:51.682
established.
So, if you took a rigid body

00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:55.079
like this, and let's apply to
the rigid body,

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:59.095
I'm just going to take a
simpler case of a rigid body

00:39:59.095 --> 00:40:01.733
with these two masses,
m_2 and

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:03.179
m_1;
it doesn't matter.

00:40:03.179 --> 00:40:07.126
I apply a force now,
F, a perpendicular to

00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:11.401
that body, at the distance
r from the point of

00:40:11.401 --> 00:40:12.470
rotation.

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:21.670
And let it that turn the body
during that time;

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:26.440
let's say the body moves by an
amount Δθ.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.583
Maybe I should draw you a
better picture for this because

00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:29.770
this is very,
very important.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.483
So, here is the body;
I just took the simplest one,

00:40:37.483 --> 00:40:39.464
with two masses,
m_1,

00:40:39.464 --> 00:40:42.448
m_2.
I'm just going to push it here

00:40:42.448 --> 00:40:45.562
and I decide to push it in this
direction, and it's at a

00:40:45.562 --> 00:40:48.280
distance r from the point
of rotation.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:57.151
And let it turn by a small
angle and come to this position,

00:40:57.151 --> 00:41:00.220
and this angle is Δθ.

00:41:03.389 --> 00:41:04.780
What is the work done by this
force?

00:41:09.269 --> 00:41:11.929
I'm going to write it down but
I want you to think about it.

00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:14.323
The work done by the force is
the force multiplied by the

00:41:14.323 --> 00:41:15.820
distance over which it has
moved.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.045
And basically,
I'm asking you what is that

00:41:18.045 --> 00:41:20.922
distance it has moved,
and if you remember anything at

00:41:20.922 --> 00:41:24.069
all from what I did earlier,
it's approximately this arc

00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:27.150
length, which we have seen,
is r times Δθ.

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:39.291
In other words,
if you apply a force F

00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:41.719
and you rotate the body by
Δθ, the distance you

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:46.802
actually move is rΔθ;
so, this is force times

00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:49.894
distance.
Now, that's got to be equal to

00:41:49.894 --> 00:41:52.683
the change in kinetic energy.
It's got to be equal to the

00:41:52.683 --> 00:41:55.710
change in kinetic energy.
Kinetic energy,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:00.079
I remind you,
is ½ Iω^(2).

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:05.668
Therefore, the change in
kinetic energy is going to be ½

00:42:05.668 --> 00:42:09.659
I(ω^(2) -
ω_0^(2)).

00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:13.200
By the way, these are two very
neighboring instants of time.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.781
If in the neighboring instants
of time, during that brief

00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:24.480
period we may take the body to
have a constant acceleration;

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.159
therefore, α is
constant.

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:31.199
So, this formula you can also
calculate when α is

00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:33.303
constant, period.
In a real body,

00:42:33.303 --> 00:42:35.748
when it's rotating,
α need not be constant,

00:42:35.748 --> 00:42:37.460
but for a small enough
interval,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.701
as small as you wish,
we may apply the formula that

00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:43.099
works when α is a
constant.

00:42:43.099 --> 00:42:47.068
In that case,
you will write it as ½ times

00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:50.660
2α times the rotation
angle.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.380
Right?
Look at this formula here.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.963
I'm referring to this result,
ω final squared

00:42:57.963 --> 00:43:02.304
-ω initial squared is 2
times α times the change

00:43:02.304 --> 00:43:05.754
in angle.
So, I want you to then equate

00:43:05.754 --> 00:43:10.070
this work done to this change in
kinetic energy.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:15.296
I want you to equate this guy
to this guy, and we get our

00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:21.270
great result that F times
r = I times α.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.440
Iα is ma;
that's what I'm looking for.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.045
So, this fellow here,
Fr, is the analog of

00:43:29.045 --> 00:43:31.000
force, and it's called the
torque.

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:42.891
It's very important to notice
that the torque due to this

00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:47.356
force is the value of the force
times the distance from the

00:43:47.356 --> 00:43:50.610
point of rotation,
and it's only the external

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.202
force that I'm talking about.
There are also internal forces

00:43:54.202 --> 00:43:56.611
in a rod.
Every part of the rod is being

00:43:56.611 --> 00:44:00.294
dragged along by another part of
the rod, but that analysis in

00:44:00.294 --> 00:44:03.373
terms of forces can be done but
it's very tricky and

00:44:03.373 --> 00:44:06.458
complicated.
It's much easier to look at the

00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:10.510
energy where the energy changes
only due to external forces.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.820
If you only look at forces
you've got to be careful.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.036
This pivot point is also
applying a force on the rod,

00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:18.820
but it's not moving and not
doing any work.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.516
So, the only external force is
the one I'm applying and is

00:44:21.516 --> 00:44:23.929
responsible for the change in
the kinetic energy.

00:44:23.929 --> 00:44:26.219
There are other forces inside
the rod.

00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:28.573
In other words,
this mass is going to pick up

00:44:28.573 --> 00:44:30.980
speed, not because I'm directly
pushing it.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.499
I'm probably pushing this part
of the rod and that's pushing

00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:37.719
the part next to it,
and it finally pushes this one.

00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:41.170
So, I'm not directly applying
the force law to this mass.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.287
I'm saying, whatever is
happening internally,

00:44:43.287 --> 00:44:45.272
I don't care;
the external force times

00:44:45.272 --> 00:44:48.270
distance is a change in the
kinetic energy of an object.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:52.120
Yes?
Student: But how are you

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:57.371
saying the angular [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:44:57.371 --> 00:45:01.256
Shankar: No,
I said this quantity,

00:45:01.256 --> 00:45:06.780
the change in kinetic energy,
is the final kinetic energy,

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.599
½ times ω^(2) minus
the initial kinetic energy;

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:12.997
but final/initial referred to
when the rod was there and the

00:45:12.997 --> 00:45:15.070
rod had rotated by a small
amount.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.506
Student: Right.
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:16.506 --> 00:45:17.546
Shankar: Okay.
Student: So,

00:45:17.546 --> 00:45:19.021
do you say it's 2α of
the [inaudible]

00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:20.530
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.356
Student: You said there
needs to be something about

00:45:23.356 --> 00:45:25.439
velocity [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:27.984
Shankar: Here.
No, I used this equation,

00:45:27.984 --> 00:45:30.892
the change, the ω^(2)
at the end, minus the

00:45:30.892 --> 00:45:34.791
ω^(2) at the beginning,
is 2 times the acceleration and

00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:38.634
the angle of acceleration times
θ - θnot is the

00:45:38.634 --> 00:45:40.990
change in θ over that
time,

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:45.012
right.
In other words,

00:45:45.012 --> 00:45:49.089
that formula can be used for
even finite periods of time

00:45:49.089 --> 00:45:53.177
provided α is constant.
We are applying it for a tiny

00:45:53.177 --> 00:45:55.610
period of time,
small enough for us to believe

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.799
that the acceleration during
that tiny period is some number

00:45:58.799 --> 00:46:00.686
α.
So, this ω^(2) -

00:46:00.686 --> 00:46:04.024
ω_0^(2) is that
really if you want the change in

00:46:04.024 --> 00:46:06.553
ω^(2),
and that's proportional to

00:46:06.553 --> 00:46:08.850
α times the change in
angle.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.396
So, α is not a constant;
α can vary from instant

00:46:12.396 --> 00:46:14.036
to instant.
But at that one instant,

00:46:14.036 --> 00:46:16.473
depending on the forces,
there'll be some α,

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:19.340
and this thing called torque is
I times α.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.874
Now, I think it's very clear
that if I had several forces

00:46:22.874 --> 00:46:25.839
acting on the body,
then the torque will be

00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:28.263
F_ir
_i,

00:46:28.263 --> 00:46:31.900
and there's just one final
caveat to this thing,

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.317
one final qualification,
which is that,

00:46:34.317 --> 00:46:36.798
in practice,
the forces that are used to

00:46:36.798 --> 00:46:39.980
rotate a body may not always be
perpendicular.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.480
You can apply a force in some
other direction,

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.030
like that.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.966
Now, you've got to realize that
torque is the ability to change

00:46:54.966 --> 00:46:59.183
the rotational state of a body,
and what we are realizing is

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.725
that it depends on the force you
apply and depends on how far

00:47:02.725 --> 00:47:05.559
away the force is from the point
of rotation.

00:47:05.559 --> 00:47:09.337
So, if you have a door,
you're trying to open a door,

00:47:09.337 --> 00:47:12.024
here is the door,
here are the hinges,

00:47:12.024 --> 00:47:16.019
and you want to open this door
by applying a force.

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:19.093
The question is,
"Where do you put the

00:47:19.093 --> 00:47:20.880
doorknob?"
Okay?

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.842
You suddenly invented the door,
you thought about hinges,

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:29.230
but you haven't quite figured
out where to put the doorknob.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.360
You're going to ask yourself,
"Well, I've complete freedom,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.382
maybe it'll look nice if I put
it there right next to the

00:47:35.382 --> 00:47:38.196
hinges,"
then you realize that there are

00:47:38.196 --> 00:47:40.852
parts of the universe,
like Moron Land,

00:47:40.852 --> 00:47:42.780
where if you go,
all the hinges,

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.579
all the doorknobs are here and
they're saying,

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.340
"You know, we're applying a lot
of force,

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.610
we're not getting anywhere.
What's wrong?"

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.513
Well, what we're realizing is
that whereas force was

00:47:51.513 --> 00:47:54.587
everything in linear motion,
force is not everything in

00:47:54.587 --> 00:47:58.023
rotational motion.
If you want to get your money's

00:47:58.023 --> 00:48:02.179
worth, you've got to take the
doorknob as far as you can and

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:05.889
put it near the end.
Okay, then, you figure that out.

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:08.422
Then you come along and you
say, "Okay, I've put the

00:48:08.422 --> 00:48:11.152
doorknob at the right place,
open the door," then you're

00:48:11.152 --> 00:48:12.989
applying enormous force this
way.

00:48:12.989 --> 00:48:15.461
And again frustrated,
again you're getting no

00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:18.157
results, you say,
"I'm going as far as I can from

00:48:18.157 --> 00:48:20.757
the hinge,"
and it dawns on you that if you

00:48:20.757 --> 00:48:23.988
really want to get something
going, you should really take

00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:27.332
the line of separation between
where it's rotating and where

00:48:27.332 --> 00:48:31.333
you're applying the force,
and apply a force perpendicular

00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:33.561
to it.
Any part parallel to it is not

00:48:33.561 --> 00:48:36.086
doing anything,
unless you kind of rip it off

00:48:36.086 --> 00:48:38.199
the hinges.
You don't want to do that.

00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:41.970
So, here this force has got a
useless part,

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.099
and got a useful part,
and the useless part,

00:48:46.099 --> 00:48:48.121
which is trying to pull the rod
off the hinges,

00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:50.449
is going to be balanced by a
force from the hinges,

00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:53.159
because the rod is a rigid rod,
it's not going to move.

00:48:53.159 --> 00:48:55.599
But the one perpendicular to
the rod can, in fact,

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.889
turn the rod without affecting
the rigidity.

00:48:57.889 --> 00:49:00.581
So, we need an extra factor
here, which is sin

00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:03.330
θ_i,
where θ_i is

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.803
defined as follows.
If you're at a point

00:49:05.803 --> 00:49:08.820
r_i,
and you apply a force F

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.382
that way,
θ is the angle between

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:14.840
the line joining the point of
application of the force,

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.711
and the direction of the force.
You are here and you're

00:49:19.711 --> 00:49:23.541
separated by this vector and as
the angle between that

00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:27.751
separation vector and the force,
that angle θ can vary

00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:29.608
from force to force.
But this force

00:49:29.608 --> 00:49:31.388
F_i,
the angle could be

00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:34.684
θ_i.
That's the final formula for

00:49:34.684 --> 00:49:38.093
the torque, okay?
So, we have built up all the

00:49:38.093 --> 00:49:40.840
pieces, and this is the final
answer.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.563
This is the definition of
torque, and with this torque we

00:49:44.563 --> 00:49:48.219
can now complete the dictionary
and say what we want.

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:52.242
On the left-hand side is the
torque, where the torque is

00:49:52.242 --> 00:49:55.095
defined as
F_ir_i

00:49:55.095 --> 00:49:58.847
sin θ_i.
F sin θ is just a

00:49:58.847 --> 00:50:02.616
component of the force
perpendicular to the separation

00:50:02.616 --> 00:50:04.541
r.
That's what F sin θ

00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:06.280
does.
I hope you can see that.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.343
If you've got a force acting
this way, F cos θ is

00:50:09.343 --> 00:50:12.351
this part, which is no good,
and F sin θ is that

00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:14.429
part, which is good for
rotations.

00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:18.821
Also, if you want,
in terms of work done,

00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:24.199
you want the force times the
distance traveled.

00:50:24.199 --> 00:50:26.300
The distance traveled is only
in this direction.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.360
There is no distance traveled
in this direction.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.812
So, the distance traveled is
F dot product with the

00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:35.312
direction in which you move,
and that applies only to the

00:50:35.312 --> 00:50:38.498
force perpendicular to the
separation, not to the part

00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:42.254
that's parallel.
Anyway, I hope we understand

00:50:42.254 --> 00:50:48.042
intuitively why this is the guy
that's responsible for rotating

00:50:48.042 --> 00:50:50.619
objects.
You want to rotate something

00:50:50.619 --> 00:50:53.221
around some axis,
you've got a certain amount of

00:50:53.221 --> 00:50:55.336
force,
you're best off applying the

00:50:55.336 --> 00:50:58.340
force as far as you can from the
point of rotation.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.787
In other words,
suppose we want the rear end of

00:51:00.787 --> 00:51:02.862
this table here,
keeping this end fixed,

00:51:02.862 --> 00:51:05.150
but I want to turn it so it's
this way.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.960
Then I'm saying,
I think we all know,

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.324
we want to start pushing here.
Also, we don't want to apply a

00:51:10.324 --> 00:51:13.306
force this way or that way,
we want to apply a force

00:51:13.306 --> 00:51:15.365
perpendicular.
If, for some reason,

00:51:15.365 --> 00:51:18.510
we are tied to a rope and can
only pull in that direction,

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.925
then the component of the force
this way is to be discounted,

00:51:21.925 --> 00:51:25.341
no use, this is the part that
does the turning and that's the

00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:29.129
part that also does the work.
Any force perpendicular to the

00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:31.420
motion is not going to do any
work.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:36.986
Any force perpendicular to the
displacement is not going to do

00:51:36.986 --> 00:51:39.483
any work.
This rigid body can only be

00:51:39.483 --> 00:51:42.192
later in that position,
so the displacement is the

00:51:42.192 --> 00:51:44.615
tangential direction,
and only the force in the

00:51:44.615 --> 00:51:46.630
tangential direction contributes
to the work.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:49.469
And in my work energy argument
that's what comes here.

00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:52.112
This is the reason why you come
up with this definition of

00:51:52.112 --> 00:51:56.959
torque.
Okay, so we've got most of the

00:51:56.959 --> 00:52:01.300
pieces for this.
I will write one more thing by

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.047
analogy.
The work done by a force that

00:52:04.047 --> 00:52:07.760
displaces a body by an amount
dx is this.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.938
The work done by a torque will
be τ times -- I think

00:52:11.938 --> 00:52:16.186
you can guess what I want to put
there -- times dθ or

00:52:16.186 --> 00:52:19.946
Δθ.
When a torque rotates a body by

00:52:19.946 --> 00:52:24.351
an angle Δθ,
then the work done is τ

00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:29.027
times Δθ.
You can see that even here you

00:52:29.027 --> 00:52:34.340
can write the work done as
F times r times

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.404
Δθ;
but that is the torque,

00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:41.489
that's the Δθ.
So, it's very useful to know.

00:52:41.489 --> 00:52:44.587
So, if you guys are going to
reason by analogy,

00:52:44.587 --> 00:52:47.281
I would ask you to know the
counterparts,

00:52:47.281 --> 00:52:49.840
only then you can do the
problems.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.232
So, let's get used to this
formula here,

00:52:54.232 --> 00:52:58.190
ΔW = τΔθ.
I'll show you one example.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:02.909
Suppose I have a rod hanging
from the ceiling.

00:53:02.909 --> 00:53:06.958
Well, let's say it's massless
and there is a mass m at

00:53:06.958 --> 00:53:10.130
the bottom and it's got some
length L;

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.567
it's a pendulum.
So, I'm going to take this

00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:18.170
pendulum and I'm going to bring
it to this position,

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.714
by an angle
θ_0,

00:53:20.714 --> 00:53:24.647
which unfortunately
θ_0 stands for

00:53:24.647 --> 00:53:28.422
the final angle.
I want to know how much work I

00:53:28.422 --> 00:53:30.687
do;
that's what we're going to

00:53:30.687 --> 00:53:33.648
calculate.
So, we take some intermediate

00:53:33.648 --> 00:53:38.278
position when we are here.
What is the force acting on

00:53:38.278 --> 00:53:40.910
this guy?
This rod is massless;

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.440
the force on this is mg.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:50.604
If that angle is θ,
you can see that angle is the

00:53:50.604 --> 00:53:54.057
same θ,
so mg cos θ acts this

00:53:54.057 --> 00:53:57.510
way, and mg sin θ acts
that way.

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:06.116
To hold the pendulum from
falling when the angle is

00:54:06.116 --> 00:54:09.815
θ, I have to apply a
tangential force in this

00:54:09.815 --> 00:54:12.590
direction of size mg sin
θ.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:16.596
I hope you guys can see that.
The mg cos θ is going

00:54:16.596 --> 00:54:20.389
to be provided by the rod.
Because the rod is a rigid

00:54:20.389 --> 00:54:23.590
body, it won't let the mass move
in this direction.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:26.792
It'll provide whatever force it
takes to keep the mass moving

00:54:26.792 --> 00:54:28.806
radially.
In the tangential direction,

00:54:28.806 --> 00:54:32.015
to keep it from sliding back to
where it began I have to apply a

00:54:32.015 --> 00:54:36.720
force mg sin θ.
So, the torque that I apply is

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.532
mg sin θ times L.
So, I did all that by taking

00:54:42.532 --> 00:54:47.090
the force, finding the component
of the force perpendicular to

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:51.199
the thing, and balancing it with
a countering force.

00:54:51.199 --> 00:54:54.695
You can equally say the torque
that I have to apply is really

00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:58.165
mg, which is the force,
R, which happens to be

00:54:58.165 --> 00:55:00.547
L here,
and sine of the angle between

00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.434
them.
No matter how we write it,

00:55:02.434 --> 00:55:05.358
that's the torque.
Let's find the work done by

00:55:05.358 --> 00:55:09.441
that torque when I rotate it
from the starting angle to some

00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:12.926
final angle.
That'll be mgL sin θ

00:55:12.926 --> 00:55:18.840
dθ from 0 to some final
angle θ_0.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.655
I'm just saying,
the work done is τΔθ summed

00:55:22.655 --> 00:55:26.030
over all the angles;
that means integrate.

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:30.056
So, you've got to go back to
your calculus thing and you've

00:55:30.056 --> 00:55:33.806
got to remember that the
integral of sin θ is - cos

00:55:33.806 --> 00:55:35.979
θ,
and you want to start from

00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:38.744
θ = 0 to θ equal
to some final angle

00:55:38.744 --> 00:55:42.345
θ_0.
And if you crank it out,

00:55:42.345 --> 00:55:47.489
you will find it's mgL
times 1 - cos θ.

00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:49.640
So, that's the work done to
take a pendulum which is

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.833
horizontal, which is vertical
and turn it to an angle

00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:52.930
θ_0.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.718
I'm going to do a cross-check
on this to tell you that it

00:56:01.718 --> 00:56:03.710
works out from another point of
view.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:08.079
This mass was down here,
now it's climbed up there.

00:56:08.079 --> 00:56:09.891
So, you can ask,
"What happened to the work I

00:56:09.891 --> 00:56:12.241
did?"
Going back to the Work Energy

00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:14.800
Theorem, let's take this mass
here.

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.039
Forces were acting on it.
One was the rod,

00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:20.959
but the force of the rod was
always perpendicular to the

00:56:20.959 --> 00:56:23.880
motion of this bob here,
so it couldn't do any work.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.409
The only work was done by me.
What happened to the work I did?

00:56:27.409 --> 00:56:31.507
The work I did has to be
changing the total energy of the

00:56:31.507 --> 00:56:34.579
body, but the bob was not moving
before,

00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:37.255
and it's not moving after,
because I give just the right

00:56:37.255 --> 00:56:40.099
force to cancel gravity;
I didn't give it any speed.

00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:42.951
So, it must be that the
potential energy of this bob

00:56:42.951 --> 00:56:45.579
when it's here should explain
the work I did.

00:56:45.579 --> 00:56:58.121
That's exactly what it is,
because let me rewrite this as

00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:07.079
[mg]
- mgL + mgL cos θ.

00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:16.360
But maybe we can see that it is
mg + mgL.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.546
This one, well,
I think it's best to write it

00:57:19.546 --> 00:57:23.168
as L - L cos θ,
and you guys can see what's

00:57:23.168 --> 00:57:26.066
going on.
L is this distance here,

00:57:26.066 --> 00:57:29.158
L cos θ is that
distance, and L - L cos

00:57:29.158 --> 00:57:32.440
θ is the increase in the
height of this bob.

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.334
This height here is in fact
L - L cos θ,

00:57:36.334 --> 00:57:40.394
because if that is L and
that is θ,

00:57:40.394 --> 00:57:44.039
this is L cos θ till
that point.

00:57:44.039 --> 00:57:47.036
So, this is just mg
times h,

00:57:47.036 --> 00:57:49.739
and that's where your work went
in.

00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:52.719
So, what's the point of this
exercise?

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:55.757
This exercise is to get you
used to the notion of

00:57:55.757 --> 00:57:58.921
calculating work done,
not as force times distance,

00:57:58.921 --> 00:58:02.454
but as torque times angle.
And here's the problem where

00:58:02.454 --> 00:58:05.139
the torque itself is changing
with the angle.

00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:07.197
The torque is itself a function
of θ,

00:58:07.197 --> 00:58:10.190
so you have to do an integral
and that's how you get the work.

00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:19.634
Okay, so now,
we've got all the machinery we

00:58:19.634 --> 00:58:25.517
need, got all the machinery we
need to do kinematics or

00:58:25.517 --> 00:58:30.420
dynamics of rigid bodies in this
analogy.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.670
So, let me summarize what it is.
You've got a rigid body;

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:37.820
it's got a moment of inertia;
it's got an angular velocity.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.909
The product of the two is
called the angular momentum,

00:58:40.909 --> 00:58:44.289
L, and to change it
you've got to apply a torque.

00:58:44.289 --> 00:58:47.028
To find the torque,
find all the external forces

00:58:47.028 --> 00:58:49.649
acting on the body,
multiply each force by the

00:58:49.649 --> 00:58:51.980
distance from the point of
rotation,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.531
but the component of each force
perpendicular to the line of

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:58.300
separation times the distance of
separation,

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.429
that's the Fr sin θ,
and add it up.

00:59:01.429 --> 00:59:06.449
Again, when you do the torques,
you've got to give it a sign.

00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:09.855
If a torque tends to rotate a
body counter-clockwise,

00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:13.226
we will take it as positive,
and if the torque tends to

00:59:13.226 --> 00:59:16.039
rotate a body clockwise,
we'll take it as negative.

00:59:16.039 --> 00:59:18.876
So, it's possible that in a
given body, there could be

00:59:18.876 --> 00:59:21.659
torques trying to move it in
different directions.

00:59:21.659 --> 00:59:25.096
So, for example,
in the simplest rigid body made

00:59:25.096 --> 00:59:28.898
up of, say, two masses,
you could be pushing this way

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:33.361
and I could be pushing that way.
We're all trying to rotate them

00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:36.486
in opposite directions.
The torque you apply would be

00:59:36.486 --> 00:59:39.777
your force times that distance;
this is called positive because

00:59:39.777 --> 00:59:42.604
you're going counter-clockwise.
The torque that I'm applying

00:59:42.604 --> 00:59:44.765
would be my force times the
smaller distance,

00:59:44.765 --> 00:59:47.760
and that'll be considered
negative because it's clockwise.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.170
And you'll add them up;
you'll get a net torque.

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.015
That net torque will cause an
acceleration of this

00:59:54.015 --> 00:59:58.159
dumbbell-like object.
What acceleration will it cause?

00:59:58.159 --> 01:00:03.580
It'll be my force times my
distance, sin θ happens to be

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.268
1, minus your force,
times the distance over which

01:00:07.268 --> 01:00:09.739
you're doing it,
times the moment of inertia.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.937
The moment of inertia for the
simple problem is

01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:15.369
m_1r
_1^(2) +

01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:18.150
m_2r&lt;s
ub&gt;2^(2),

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.250
if this is m_1
and this is

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.849
r_1,
and this is

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:23.849
m_2 and that
distance is

01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:27.172
r_2.
So, this is the simplest

01:00:27.172 --> 01:00:30.869
problem you could do in rigid
body dynamics.

01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:33.047
Take a couple of forces,
work out the torques,

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.467
divide it by moment of inertia
and get the angle of

01:00:35.467 --> 01:00:38.344
acceleration.
If the torque is a constant,

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:41.828
it's hard to maintain that.
What do I have to do to keep

01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:44.424
the torque constant?
I've got to start running

01:00:44.424 --> 01:00:47.962
around with this as it rotates,
and you could imagine doing

01:00:47.962 --> 01:00:49.680
that;
then, the torque will be

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.706
constant, αa will be
constant, α constant is

01:00:52.706 --> 01:00:55.468
like a constant,
and you can do the whole bunch

01:00:55.468 --> 01:00:59.052
of problems you guys did before.
Okay, now there is one

01:00:59.052 --> 01:01:04.905
technical obstacle you've got to
overcome if you want to do rigid

01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:07.769
body dynamics,
and that is to know how to

01:01:07.769 --> 01:01:10.590
compute the moment of inertia
for all kinds of objects.

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:13.764
If I give you 37 masses,
each with a distance r

01:01:13.764 --> 01:01:16.820
from the point of rotation,
it's a trivial thing.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.070
Do mr^(2) for each one
and add it.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:21.926
But here is the kind of objects
you may be given,

01:01:21.926 --> 01:01:25.079
not a discreet set of masses
but a continuous blob.

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:27.873
Just like in the case of center
of mass, when you had a bunch of

01:01:27.873 --> 01:01:29.958
masses, you took
m_1x_1 +

01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:32.530
m_2x_2 +
m_3x_3

01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:34.647
and so on.
But if you had a rod which is

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:36.590
continuous, you have to do an
integral.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:39.820
So you will have to do an
integral here also.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.354
So, let's take certain rigid
bodies and try to find the

01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:46.366
moment of inertia,
which are rigid bodies which

01:01:46.366 --> 01:01:50.110
are continuous.
So, here is a ring of radius

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:53.746
r and mass M.
It's not a disk,

01:01:53.746 --> 01:01:58.632
in spite of what it looks like.
It is a ring and I want to find

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:02.820
its moment of inertia.
So, you have to think about

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.222
what you will do.
So, you think for a second,

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:10.310
and I'll tell you the way I
will do that is to partition it

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.704
into tiny pieces,
each of which is small enough

01:02:13.704 --> 01:02:17.518
for me to consider a point.
This tiny piece has a mass

01:02:17.518 --> 01:02:21.169
Δm_i,
and i goes from 1,2,

01:02:21.169 --> 01:02:24.381
3,4 to whatever,
10 million, till I go around

01:02:24.381 --> 01:02:27.149
the circle.
The moment of inertia would

01:02:27.149 --> 01:02:30.941
be--I use Δm_i
to tell you it's a tiny mass for

01:02:30.941 --> 01:02:34.619
this section.
But what is the r^(2)?

01:02:34.619 --> 01:02:37.679
If I'm planning to rotate it
around that point,

01:02:37.679 --> 01:02:40.139
I plan to rotate around that
point;

01:02:40.139 --> 01:02:43.150
it is the same r^(2) for
everybody.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:46.766
So, you can pull it out of the
summation and you just get

01:02:46.766 --> 01:02:52.389
Mr^(2).
So, this is a very easy problem.

01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:55.331
This is as easy as this
problem, but you clearly had

01:02:55.331 --> 01:02:58.791
only one mass and all of it was
at distance r from the

01:02:58.791 --> 01:03:01.050
point of rotation,
it's Mr^(2).

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.661
Here, you got the mass spread
out, but luckily spread it out

01:03:03.661 --> 01:03:06.494
in such a way that every part of
it is the same distance r

01:03:06.494 --> 01:03:08.957
from the center,
so it's very easy to do the

01:03:08.957 --> 01:03:10.815
summation.
Pull out the r^(2),

01:03:10.815 --> 01:03:12.920
do the sum over mass and get
the total mass.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.110
Then we're going to do--Any
questions about this?

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:20.530
Everything is going to be built
on understanding this.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.722
So, for the ring,
this is the moment of inertia,

01:03:23.722 --> 01:03:27.121
which is Mr^(2).
But now, I want to do the

01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:30.837
following.
I want to take a disk now,

01:03:30.837 --> 01:03:33.120
of radius r;

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:41.481
I've got to do the sum of
Mr^(2) for every mass in

01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:43.938
the problem.
So, here is where you have to

01:03:43.938 --> 01:03:46.228
organize your thinking.
I plan to do the moment of

01:03:46.228 --> 01:03:47.900
inertia through the center.
First of all,

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.805
if I didn't tell you the moment
of inertia through where you

01:03:50.805 --> 01:03:53.211
cannot even start;
I tell you I want it through

01:03:53.211 --> 01:03:55.842
the center.
To want it through the center

01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:59.785
we have the ability then to
think of this as made up of a

01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:05.727
whole bunch of concentric rings,
each one at radius r and

01:04:05.727 --> 01:04:10.867
of thickness dr.
If you can find the moment of

01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:15.340
inertia of this tiny shaded
region, I sum over all the

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.548
little washers,
the annuli that I have,

01:04:18.548 --> 01:04:22.322
to fill up the whole disk.
So, what's the moment of

01:04:22.322 --> 01:04:27.780
inertia of this annulus?
Well, I already told you.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.367
If the annulus has a mass
M, then it's

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.719
Mr^(2) is the moment of
inertia of that annulus.

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:36.345
So, the question is,
"What is the mass of the shaded

01:04:36.345 --> 01:04:40.200
region?"
Clearly, the r^(2) we

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.449
use is the r at which it
is sitting.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.480
But what's the mass I should
use?

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.377
Well, for the mass I should
use, I argue that if the total

01:04:51.377 --> 01:04:54.386
mass is that [M]
that times [should have said

01:04:54.386 --> 01:04:56.915
"over"]
πR^(2) is the mass per

01:04:56.915 --> 01:05:00.270
unit area.
Then, I need the area of this

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:03.790
shaded region.
That's the tricky part.

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.120
Have you got that?
Yes?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.459
Student: 2πrdr.
Professor Ramamurti

01:05:07.459 --> 01:05:09.677
Shankar: Right,
so let's ask why it's

01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:12.107
2πrdr.
If you take this annulus,

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:15.199
and you take a pair of scissors
and you cut it out,

01:05:15.199 --> 01:05:19.590
and you open it out,
it's going to look like a long

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:23.630
rectangle whose thickness will
be dr;

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:31.065
its length will be 2πr.
So, 2πrdr is the--that

01:05:31.065 --> 01:05:38.519
says contribution,
here is the dr.

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:40.530
Now, you've got to add it up
over everything.

01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.610
Adding it up is what we do by
doing the integral.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.309
Now, I don't want to do this
integral;

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.039
you guys can at least guess
what's going to happen.

01:05:49.039 --> 01:05:50.740
There's going to be no
π in the answer;

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.742
π is gone.
You've got rr^(2) is

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:56.949
r^(3),
r^(4)/4 and that'll,

01:05:56.949 --> 01:06:03.369
if you combine it with that,
you get this MR^(2)/2.

01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:08.730
So, the moment of inertia of a
disk is MR^(2)/2.

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:12.874
That's because if I came and
told you moment of--suppose I

01:06:12.874 --> 01:06:16.219
made a calculation with a
mistake somewhere,

01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:21.280
and I said it's MR^(2),
will you know I'm wrong?

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.690
And why will you argue that it
cannot be the right answer?

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.036
Yes?
Student: Well,

01:06:30.036 --> 01:06:32.329
it's like the ring but the
radii are smaller.

01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:34.130
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:36.372
In other words,
his answer, the correct answer

01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:39.214
is if it is MR^(2) it
means the entire mass is at a

01:06:39.214 --> 01:06:42.070
distance R^(2).
But we know some of the mass is

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:45.172
a lot closer to the center.
In fact, some of it is right at

01:06:45.172 --> 01:06:48.174
the center, so you cannot get
the same R^(2) as a

01:06:48.174 --> 01:06:50.140
contribution from all the
pieces.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.424
Some will be at 0 distance;
some will be at the full

01:06:52.424 --> 01:06:54.277
distance.
So, whenever you do the moment

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:56.424
of inertia for a disk,
it's got to look like

01:06:56.424 --> 01:06:59.620
MR^(2) times a number
which is definitely less than 1.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.492
It turns out it's half;
if we got a third or a fourth

01:07:02.492 --> 01:07:04.619
you wouldn't know it's obviously
wrong.

01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:07.035
But if I got 1 in front,
or worse, if I got 2 times

01:07:07.035 --> 01:07:08.920
MR^(2),
then you know I've made a

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.349
mistake.
Okay, now, the last of the

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:22.529
objects I want to look at today,
is a rod, I want to take--This

01:07:22.529 --> 01:07:31.265
is actually the example that's
done quite often as the first

01:07:31.265 --> 01:07:43.960
example but I will do it now.
So, here is a rod, okay?

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.308
It has length L,
mass M,

01:07:47.308 --> 01:07:51.110
and I say, what's the moment of
inertia?

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:55.988
Do you know what you could do?
What's the first question you

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:59.159
will ask when I say,
"What's the moment of inertia?

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.559
Student: Around what
point?

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:01.454
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Around what point,

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:02.780
right?
Till I tell you that,

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.666
you cannot begin.
So, I will say,

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:07.670
"Let's find the moment of
inertia around this end."

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:10.707
So, what you should imagine in
that case is--You stick a nail

01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:13.845
through here and the guy rotates
like that on a big circle with

01:08:13.845 --> 01:08:16.462
that as the center.
If you stuck the nail through

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:18.316
this midpoint,
it's a different story,

01:08:18.316 --> 01:08:22.912
and the answer is different.
So here, what I do is I take a

01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:28.056
distance x.
I take a sliver of thickness

01:08:28.056 --> 01:08:30.970
dx.
That sliver is small enough for

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.939
me to consider there's a point
mass.

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:36.718
Therefore, the moment of
inertia of that tiny portion

01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:41.224
will look like the square of the
distance times the mass of the

01:08:41.224 --> 01:08:44.699
tiny portion.
The mass of the tiny portion

01:08:44.699 --> 01:08:46.060
looks like this.

01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:00.876
Let me see;
that's the mass per unit

01:09:00.876 --> 01:09:03.890
length, that's the length,
that's the mass of the object.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.350
Then I have to do the integral
from 0 to L.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:12.930
Well, x^(2) will give me
x^(3)/3.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.662
That'll give me
ML^(2)/3,

01:09:16.662 --> 01:09:22.199
and that's the moment of
inertia of the rod.

01:09:22.199 --> 01:09:24.062
Again, it looks like
ML^(2),

01:09:24.062 --> 01:09:27.460
it's got to have a number in
front of it that's less than 1,

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.779
because if you're measuring
from here the furthest you can

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:33.405
be is L;
a lot of the guys had a lot

01:09:33.405 --> 01:09:35.254
closer.
So, the weighted average of the

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.500
square of the distance cannot be
all L^(2);

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.649
it's got to be something less
than L^(2).

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:42.836
The fact that it's 1/3 is of
course what you do all the work

01:09:42.836 --> 01:09:44.325
for.
Student: You need an

01:09:44.325 --> 01:09:45.355
L too.
Professor Ramamurti

01:09:45.355 --> 01:09:46.649
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: An L too.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.205
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You forgot the

01:09:49.205 --> 01:09:51.310
L here?
Student: Yeah.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.554
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Also,

01:09:53.554 --> 01:09:56.866
the dimension for the moment of
inertia should be in the end

01:09:56.866 --> 01:10:03.090
mass times length squared.
Yes?

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:05.670
You're not happy with that?
Student: No, I'm not.

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:06.370
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You agree,

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.260
okay.
Look, sometimes I do get these

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.634
things wrong,
so you should always try to

01:10:10.634 --> 01:10:15.218
keep an eye on this.
The last thing I want to do is

01:10:15.218 --> 01:10:20.476
to find the--Well,
when I say last thing I want to

01:10:20.476 --> 01:10:22.476
do,
I don't mean I'm reluctant to

01:10:22.476 --> 01:10:24.909
do it, I'm just saying I'm near
the end of the day.

01:10:24.909 --> 01:10:28.826
The final thing that I will now
calculate is the moment of

01:10:28.826 --> 01:10:33.022
inertia around the center.
Let's see what's going to

01:10:33.022 --> 01:10:35.806
happen.
It's the same integral,

01:10:35.806 --> 01:10:38.041
x^(2),
dx/L,

01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:43.136
M/L, but the range of
integration for x will

01:10:43.136 --> 01:10:47.160
now go from -L/2 to +
L/2.

01:10:55.699 --> 01:11:01.252
Then, I simplify my life by
writing it as 2M/L times

01:11:01.252 --> 01:11:04.890
x^(2)dx from 0 to
L/2.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.310
This is something I encourage
you to do all the time.

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:09.991
If an integral is an even
function of x,

01:11:09.991 --> 01:11:13.079
namely, -x contributes
as much as +x,

01:11:13.079 --> 01:11:16.510
then you can take half the
reason of integration and double

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:19.099
the answer.
You can do it only if it's an

01:11:19.099 --> 01:11:21.609
even function,
so if x and--yes?

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:24.335
Student: How come it's
still over L if you put

01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:26.613
x in with the other one?
Professor Ramamurti

01:11:26.613 --> 01:11:28.121
Shankar: Oh,
I'm sorry, you're absolutely

01:11:28.121 --> 01:11:31.023
right.
The way to do that would be

01:11:31.023 --> 01:11:33.190
here.
See, you keep trying,

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:36.710
you will catch me.
That's right, that's correct.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:40.195
Okay, so let's do this now,
2M/L,

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:45.380
okay, now I'm really anxious,
because this L^(3),

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.352
it's the X^(3)/3,
but the thing that's being

01:11:49.352 --> 01:11:52.973
cubed is L/2,
and that's giving me

01:11:52.973 --> 01:11:54.660
ML^(2)/12.

01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:04.470
So, the moment of inertia is
not a fixed number.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.273
It got a lot smaller when I
took it around the center of

01:12:07.273 --> 01:12:09.079
mass.
When I took it around the left

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:11.771
edge, I got ML^(2)/3;
I went to the midpoint,

01:12:11.771 --> 01:12:14.615
I got ML^(2)/12.
I think it's pretty clear that

01:12:14.615 --> 01:12:16.659
I'm going from here I reduce the
answer.

01:12:16.659 --> 01:12:20.020
So, when I keep going,
it will get even smaller.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.230
That's where your common sense
will tell you that if you got

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:26.331
some answer from there you're
going to get the same answer

01:12:26.331 --> 01:12:29.595
from here and you hit the best
possible moment of inertia you

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.511
can.
You should be able to argue

01:12:31.511 --> 01:12:34.558
intuitively, and if you do the
calculation, it'll come out to

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.813
be the same.
Now, the thing to check if you

01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:42.884
do this, the moment of inertia
around one end is the moment of

01:12:42.884 --> 01:12:48.369
inertia around the center less
the mass times (L/2)^(2).

01:12:48.369 --> 01:12:51.069
This is something you can
actually verify.

01:12:51.069 --> 01:12:55.586
Just take the numbers I gave
you and you'll find that this

01:12:55.586 --> 01:13:00.024
answer plus M times
(L/2)^(2) will be equal

01:13:00.024 --> 01:13:03.386
to that answer.
And this happens to be a very

01:13:03.386 --> 01:13:06.140
general theorem I'll talk about
next time.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:09.697
If you know the moment of
inertia through the center of

01:13:09.697 --> 01:13:11.409
mass, you're done,
okay?

01:13:11.409 --> 01:13:14.443
If I want the moment of inertia
through any other point,

01:13:14.443 --> 01:13:17.642
I take the moment of inertia
through the center of mass and

01:13:17.642 --> 01:13:20.897
add to it the total mass of the
object and the square of the

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.600
distance by which you made me
move my axis,

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.970
which here happens to be
L/2.

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.869
I will of course prove this;
I don't want to give you

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:30.708
anything without proof.
We can actually,

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:33.595
in our class actually,
satisfy ourselves that this is

01:13:33.595 --> 01:13:36.208
true.
Not only is it true for a rod,

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:39.551
it's even true for a disk.
It's true for any object in two

01:13:39.551 --> 01:13:42.201
dimensions, that if you've got
the moment of inertia of this

01:13:42.201 --> 01:13:44.273
creature,
through the center of mass,

01:13:44.273 --> 01:13:47.397
and you want it through that
point, just take the answer

01:13:47.397 --> 01:13:50.749
through the center of mass and
add to it Md^(2) where

01:13:50.749 --> 01:13:55.000
d is that distance.
That'll be proven next time.

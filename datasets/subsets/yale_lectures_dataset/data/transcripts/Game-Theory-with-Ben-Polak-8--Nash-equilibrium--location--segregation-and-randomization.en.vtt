00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.736
Professor Ben Polak: So
last time we left things in the

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:07.114
middle of a model,
which was the candidate-voter

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.149
model.
What was--I don't want to go

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.263
over the whole model again,
but just to reiterate a little

00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:15.322
bit--what was different about
that model from what we saw

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:18.217
before--the main thing that was
different was that the

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.840
candidates cannot choose their
positions.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.224
If you like,
every voter is a potential

00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:26.550
candidate but you know the
positions of the voters.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.860
Let me just bring out two
lessons that we left hanging

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.572
last time.
I want to just put them on the

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:32.920
board to make sure they're in
your notes.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.253
So the first lesson is--one
thing we saw already last

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:40.099
time--is there can be lots of
different Nash Equilibrium this

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.403
model.
There are multiple possible

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.730
Nash Equilibrium in this model
and more to the point,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.363
not all of those equilibria
have the candidates crowded at

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:53.254
the center.
We saw early on in the classic

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:56.984
Downs or median-voter model that
that model predicted crowding

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:58.760
the center.
This one doesn't,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.979
and we'll come back to that in
a second.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.511
And a second thing we saw last
time was that entry can--if you

00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:10.043
enter on the left one affect of
entering on the left can be to

00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:14.129
make the candidate on the right
more likely to win.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.911
Conversely, if you enter on the
right--you're a right-wing voter

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.766
candidate and you enter,
that can make it more likely

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.935
that the left wings are--can
lead to the winner being

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:25.860
more--being further from your
ideal position.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.893
Just to revisit this a little
bit, let me go back and just

00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:30.810
illustrate those two points
again.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.003
So I'll take a row further back
this time and get a nice full

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.450
row that we can see the whole
of.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.085
This way, I'm going to take a
row further back so that this

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.811
time we have no confusion about
what left wing and right wing

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.640
is,
at least almost no confusion.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.330
So let me choose this row,
this row good okay.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.025
I'm sorry, the people in the
balcony are going to have to

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:51.845
imagine this.
It's a penalty being in the

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.910
balcony.
So this row.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.679
And here's my left wing of this
row (for everyone who's in front

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.851
of you which is almost
everybody), and here's my right

00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:03.144
wing.
Let's try and illustrate some

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.882
equilibrium we saw last time.
So, in particular,

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.753
if I can get the guy in the
blue Yale shirt to stand up a

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.880
second and the guy with his
computer to stand up a second.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.700
Sorry.
Let's assume all the seats are

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.841
filled for now so--just to help
me out a little bit since I'm

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:22.047
doing this on the fly.
This, I'm going to claim is an

00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:24.353
equilibrium.
Notice that there are two

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:27.914
candidates standing and notice
that they are not particularly

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.709
close to the center.
We have our sort of

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.319
middle-of-the-democratic-party
left candidates.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.930
So I'm tempted to give you a
name but perhaps I will not.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.087
And here's a
middle-of-the-republican-party

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:43.500
candidate.
And this is the election.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.815
They're going to split the
votes equally if I've actually

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:49.464
chosen correctly.
So, just to observe some things

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:50.986
here.
First, for this to be an

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:54.000
equilibrium, it better be the
case that they're symmetric on

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.389
left and right.
If they're not symmetric,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.855
then it isn't an equilibrium
because one of those candidates

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:03.440
is going to lose for sure and
the way we set up the model that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.083
means that one of them will drop
out: they will deviate to drop

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.260
out.
Is that correct?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.462
Let's also illustrate this.
So, we've already illustrated

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.490
that they're not particularly
close to the center.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.747
Let's illustrate what I meant
by somebody on the left causing

00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:19.465
the right wing to win.
So, if this was the election,

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.150
here we are getting closer and
closer to the election,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.720
and suddenly one of our
left-wing guys,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.577
so Dennis Kucinich or something
decides to enter--so let's

00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:31.960
suppose this is Dennis Kucinich
and he enters.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.340
If Dennis Kucinich,
our left-wing guy enters,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.370
there might be some sort of
moral victory in entering,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.525
but the result of this will be
that our right-wing candidate

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:41.680
wins;
everyone sees that now?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.604
If these three guys are
standing, Dennis Kucinich is

00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:47.987
going to steal some votes from
our center-left candidate and

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:50.509
cause our center-right candidate
to win.

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.076
Now, that may or may not be Mr.
Kucinich's intention,

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:56.820
but we should at least be aware
of it.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.788
So, this is a real effect.
Go back to the 2000 election

00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:04.747
and think about what happened
when Nadar entered and "do the

00:04:04.747 --> 00:04:07.590
math" as it were,
which people didn't do at the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.479
time apparently.
If you were listening to the

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.751
newspapers or if you read The
New York Times this morning

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.229
or listened to the radio this
morning,

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.012
you'll find exactly the same
debate is going on now in the

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:17.896
republican party.
Some member--actually it's the

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:19.459
other way around,
it's the right wing this time;

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.110
I suppose we should switch it
around.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.531
So the right--some people on
the right of the republican

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:27.889
party are saying that if it
turns out that Giuliani,

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.718
who currently is leading in the
polls, wins the republican

00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:33.250
nomination they will run a
third-party candidate.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.970
Of course the debate is
actually in these terms.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.533
If they run a right-wing
third-party candidate--so that

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:42.294
would be our guy over here,
this might be--this might have

00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:47.960
payoff in terms of other things.
But in terms of the election,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.500
it's going to result in Hilary
winning.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.879
So we've seen these two effects.
They're very real effects.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.229
We're not necessarily getting
people crowding the center and

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.329
we have to worry about,
when we enter,

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:03.928
causing the other wing to win.
This isn't-- I'm not making a

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:07.379
left wing/right wing politics
argument here--this is true for

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.537
both wings symmetrically.
So, let's try and bring one

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.346
more idea in here,
which is where we ended up last

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:16.899
time, which is just how far away
from the center can we be?

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.201
So these guys sit down a second
and let's stand up,

00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:21.720
Mr.
Kucinich , again;

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.240
I know that isn't your real
name but never mind.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.933
Mr.
Kucinich out here on the left

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:26.944
and Mr.
crazy-right-wing guy whose name

00:05:26.944 --> 00:05:29.590
I've-- who's the most crazy
right wing guy of these

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.620
candidates?
I'm not--I'll get in trouble

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.082
whoever I name--so whoever the
most crazy right-wing candidate

00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:36.730
you can think of.
and now we have the full

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.870
spectrum represented with just
the extremes standing.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.728
Here we have--they're symmetric
around the center,

00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:46.120
but I claim this is not an
equilibrium.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.762
So the people in the balcony,
I've got the extreme right and

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:52.190
the extreme left standing here.
Why is this not an equilibrium?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.890
Yeah I should--it's my fault I
should have brought the mike.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.670
Can I have the mike?
I'm sorry my fault.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.720
Thanks.
This one.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.879
So Katie, why is that not an
equilibrium?

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.677
Student: Because the
person in the center could stand

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:04.963
up and win the majority.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:06.042
Exactly, because the person in
the center could stand up and

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:07.730
win.
Actually, it doesn't only have

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.810
to be the person exactly in the
center.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.536
A wide array of center
candidates could deviate and win

00:06:13.536 --> 00:06:16.038
at this point.
So, if this was the two

00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:18.652
candidates standing,
and you imagine a third

00:06:18.652 --> 00:06:20.995
candidate standing,
who for example,

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:23.320
is this gentleman,
if he was to stand,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.089
we could--he has to be a little
bit closer to the center,

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:31.522
let's say this guy,
the guy in gray--fairly clearly

00:06:31.522 --> 00:06:35.649
he's going to end up winning.
So this is the third lesson.

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.586
If the candidates are too far
apart we're going to see some

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:40.510
center entry,
which is going to win.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.407
Thank you guys.
So even though there isn't this

00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:48.629
full Downsian effect of pushing
candidates towards the center,

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.508
even though we don't have the
median-voter theorem here,

00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:54.019
we still have part of the
intuition surviving.

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:56.175
The part of the intuition
that's survives is,

00:06:56.175 --> 00:06:58.918
if the candidates are too far
apart, then the center will

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:07.665
enter and win.
So there is something pulling

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:17.244
people to the center still.
So a reasonable question here

00:07:17.244 --> 00:07:20.939
is just how far apart in
equilibrium can the candidates

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.467
be?
We've established that we can

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:24.779
have two candidates and they
needn't both be at the center.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.070
We've established that they
can't be at the extremes.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.655
How far apart can they be?
Well, this is really just

00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:35.377
a--it's kind of a nerdy question
to get it precisely but let's

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:42.800
get it precisely nevertheless.
So let's have a look,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:52.212
let's use the other board.
So, here's the full extent of

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:55.737
our political spectrum from 0 to
1, and let me just try and

00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:58.230
illustrate how far apart these
can be.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:07.328
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to divide this into sixths

00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:13.104
- 1/6,2/6,1/2,4/6,5/6.
So I claim--and I'll show

00:08:13.104 --> 00:08:17.584
afterwards--I'll claim that
provided the two candidates

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:21.649
aren't outside of 1/6 and 5/6
that that will be an

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.871
equilibrium.
So, in particular,

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:30.810
if the candidates are just
inside 1/6 and just inside 5/6,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.925
or just more than 1/6 and just
less than 5/6--so here's one of

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:41.040
these candidates who's standing
and here's the other one--then

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.810
we'll be okay.
Now why?

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.529
Why is that the right answer?
Anyone want to try a guess?

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:49.740
This was the question I sent
you over the weekend.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.493
I'm sure you were doing other
things over the weekend but

00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:55.840
nevertheless,
why is this answer?

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.470
Well, let's see.
What are they vulnerable too?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.339
They're vulnerable to deviation
by somebody entering at the

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:04.327
center.
And if somebody enters at the

00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:06.909
center--what would make somebody
enter at the center?

00:09:06.909 --> 00:09:09.970
They're going to enter at the
center if they can win

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.150
basically.
So if they enter at the center

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.952
in this case,
let's see how many votes

00:09:13.952 --> 00:09:16.131
everyone gets.
So if we enter at the center

00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:18.594
here--here's our new
candidate--who's thinking about

00:09:18.594 --> 00:09:22.452
entering at the center.
So he's sort of thinking about

00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:23.968
it.
So what's his or her

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.763
calculation going to be?
Well, let's look at what would

00:09:26.763 --> 00:09:30.949
have happened.
So all of these voters are

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:36.769
going to vote for our left-wing
candidate.

00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:39.129
So these are going to vote for
the left-wing candidate.

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:44.958
All of these voters are going
to vote for the right-wing

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.383
candidate.
They're all closest to the

00:09:47.383 --> 00:09:50.117
right-wing candidate.
And the middle third--that's a

00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:52.988
third of the voters,
another third--and the middle

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:56.211
third (these ones here) are
going to vote for the center

00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:57.559
candidate.
Is that right?

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:00.392
So I've basically divided--the
reason I divided it into sixths

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.899
is I want to put everybody at
the middle of a third.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:06.184
So here the left-wing candidate
is at the middle of the left

00:10:06.184 --> 00:10:07.940
third;
the right wing candidate is at

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.561
the middle of the right third,
and the center candidate is at

00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.789
the middle of the center third
not surprisingly.

00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:16.519
So if the center candidate
enters, if they were exactly at

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:19.921
1/6 and 5/6, they would split
the vote and the center

00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.670
candidate would win with
probably 1/3.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.332
Is that right?
But without worrying about that

00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:29.955
exact case suppose that this--as
I claimed that the left-wing

00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:33.518
candidate is just slightly to
the right of 1/6 and the right

00:10:33.518 --> 00:10:36.899
wing candidate is just slightly
to the left of 5/6.

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:41.415
Now this left-wing candidate
gets a few extra votes here and

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:46.159
the right wing candidate gets a
few extra votes here (let's put

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:49.569
them a bit harder),
and you can see now that the

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:51.750
center candidate isn't going to
win.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.347
Is that right?
Because the left-wing candidate

00:10:53.347 --> 00:10:54.860
is getting slightly more than
1/3 of the votes;

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.057
the right wing candidate's
going to get slightly more than

00:10:57.057 --> 00:10:59.521
1/3 of the votes;
so the center candidate is

00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.753
going to get squeezed out.
So just a little bit of

00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:05.806
thinking about it,
we can tell in this very simple

00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:09.420
model the furthest apart the
left and right wing candidates

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.112
can be is at 1/6 and 5/6.
They can't go to the extremes,

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:16.149
but they're not pulled all the
way to the center.

00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:20.058
So that's just a little bit of
nerdy math to confirm it,

00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:23.679
or nerdy thinking about it.
But coming back to our lesson,

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.538
which is what I guess we care
about-- coming back to our

00:11:26.538 --> 00:11:30.543
lessons,
the third lesson here is if the

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:34.974
candidates--if the two
candidates are too

00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:41.620
extreme--where too extreme in
this model meant beyond…

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:48.710
meant less than 1/6 and more
than 5/6--but are too extreme,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:55.700
someone in the center will
enter.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.040
Again, if you look back in both
American History and other

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.249
countries' history,
you'll see that when candidates

00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:06.157
are perceived to be too far
apart there's been tremendous

00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:09.272
temptation for center parties
with third parties to establish

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:12.459
themselves in the center.
So again, with some biased

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:14.965
towards England,
this is what happened in

00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:18.600
English History during the
Thatcher Period for example.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.519
The Thatcher government was
perceived to be quite far on the

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.065
right.
The Labor Party at times could

00:12:22.065 --> 00:12:25.872
be quite far on the left.
And we saw a center party set

00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:29.933
up in between them.
Okay, so these seem to be the

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:33.200
three main politics lessons of
this model.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.647
Is everyone happy with that?
I'm rushing it slightly because

00:12:35.647 --> 00:12:38.603
we said that already last time
and we're happy with how it

00:12:38.603 --> 00:12:41.849
works?
There's a also a Game Theory

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:47.607
lesson that I want to just keep
in mind here without--well,

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:51.279
there's a Game Theory lesson
here.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:54.387
And the Game Theory lesson is
that our method of finding

00:12:54.387 --> 00:12:59.449
equilibrium in this model,
which was what--it's guess and

00:12:59.449 --> 00:13:03.740
check--is actually pretty
effective.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.249
You might think that guess and
check, since it doesn't sound

00:13:06.249 --> 00:13:08.744
like advanced mathematics,
wouldn't be such a great way of

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.889
going about solving games and
thinking about them,

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:12.059
and thinking about the real
world.

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:14.441
But actually,
guess and check did pretty well

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:16.193
here.
We were able to make sensible

00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:18.585
guesses pretty quickly.
We were pretty quickly able to

00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:22.659
figure out what was going on.
And the key here is what?

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:25.144
Without writing it necessarily,
the key here is:

00:13:25.144 --> 00:13:27.100
be systematic when you're
guessing.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.639
Make sure you've looked
everywhere.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.495
And second, be systematic,
be careful when you're

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:34.302
checking.
The big error is to ignore

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:37.986
certain types of deviation.
In this particular model,

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:41.155
people very quickly realized
that one possible deviation is

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:44.146
for someone else to enter.
But perhaps they're a little

00:13:44.146 --> 00:13:46.860
bit less good at spotting that
another possible type of

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.919
deviation is for somebody to
drop out.

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:51.519
You want to look at all
possible types of deviation.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:58.486
But if you're careful,
this is a very effective

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:01.450
method.
So, that's all I want to say

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.709
about this politics model,
and I want to move onto a model

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.340
that perhaps has more to do with
sociology.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.697
We'll do a little tour of the
Social Sciences here in showing

00:14:10.697 --> 00:14:13.159
how Game Theory can apply to
each in turn.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:18.925
So to do that I'm going
to--I'll put this up so you can

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:23.090
still read it and work on this
board.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.477
So, we're going to play another
game this morning,

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:30.693
and it's going to be completely
different from the games we've

00:14:30.693 --> 00:14:34.909
played so far but it's still
going to have lessons in it.

00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:36.829
It's going to be another
location model,

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:39.340
so that's a connection to what
we've done before.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.139
But the idea of this game is as
follows.

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:46.795
We're going to imagine that
there are two towns,

00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:51.946
two possible locations,
and we'll call them East Town

00:14:51.946 --> 00:14:56.592
and West Town.
And we're going to assume that

00:14:56.592 --> 00:15:00.789
there are two types of people in
the world.

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:08.546
So, there's two types of
people, and these types of

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:13.710
people are tall and short.
Deliberately,

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.350
this is arbitrary,
right?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.281
East and West seems kind of
meaningless, almost meaningless,

00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:20.019
in the nomenclature of the
towns.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.679
I guess there's something about
where they are.

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:24.616
And tall and short is for
pretty meaningless nomenclature

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:26.976
for the people,
except it says something about

00:15:26.976 --> 00:15:29.775
how tall they are.
The idea here is that people

00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:31.950
are going to choose where they
live.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.870
Let's assume that there's lots
of people.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.590
there's 100,000 of each type of
person.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:46.730
And let's assume that each town
holds 100,000 people.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:52.352
These are fairly big towns.
So, the players in this game

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:55.654
are going to be the people,
the 200,000 people--200,000

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:59.079
tall people and 200,000 short
people--but in a minute I'm

00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:02.259
going to tell you whether you're
tall or short.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:04.249
So actually,
you're going to be the players

00:16:04.249 --> 00:16:07.467
in this game.
The strategies are going to be

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.230
a choice of whether you choose
East or West.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.998
So these are the players and
these are going to end up being

00:16:16.998 --> 00:16:20.235
the strategies.
Each of you is going to choose

00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:23.227
do I want to live in the East
Town or do I want to live in

00:16:23.227 --> 00:16:25.186
West Town?
So, as usual,

00:16:25.186 --> 00:16:29.580
what's missing is the payoffs.
To model the payoffs,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.179
let me first of all draw a
picture and then come back and

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:35.291
explain it.
So, the picture is going to

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:38.038
look like this.
Here's the payoff picture,

00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:42.329
and it's a little complicated
so just bear with me for a

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:46.124
second.
So, on the horizontal axis I'm

00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:51.851
going to put the number of
people of your type in the town

00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:58.943
you end up in.
So on the horizontal axis is

00:16:58.943 --> 00:17:06.250
the number of your type in your
town.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.916
So the most this could possibly
be is 100,000 because that would

00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:15.063
say everybody is the same type
as you in the town and the

00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:19.433
lowest it could possibly be is 0
because that would say that

00:17:19.433 --> 00:17:24.100
everyone in the town except for
you is of the other type.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.585
Is that right?
I'm going to draw this payoff

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:30.789
function.
This is going to be your payoff.

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:38.990
This is going to be
utility--the payoff of you.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.730
Let's assume this is Type X,
it doesn't really matter.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.438
Let's assume this is the tall
type payoff which is going to be

00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:47.809
symmetric for the other type as
well.

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:50.560
So the payoffs going to look
like this.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:18:03.010
Be careful.
Let me draw it and then explain

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:08.272
it.
That goes like this and then

00:18:08.272 --> 00:18:12.122
like this.
So the idea here--the idea is

00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:15.631
more important than the
picture--the idea is,

00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:19.059
if you are a minority of 1 in
your town,

00:18:19.059 --> 00:18:25.432
so everyone else is of the
other type, you get a payoff of

00:18:25.432 --> 00:18:28.260
0.
If you are in the majority,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.051
and in fact,
everyone in your town is of the

00:18:32.051 --> 00:18:35.930
same type then you get a payoff
of a 1/2.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.208
And if it's the case that
everyone in your town--sorry,

00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:44.250
if it's the case that your town
is exactly mixed,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:50.054
so half of your town is tall
and half of your town are short,

00:18:50.054 --> 00:18:53.930
then you get a payoff of 1.
I put a half here.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.573
That's really the wrong thing
to put here, it should be a 1/2

00:18:58.573 --> 00:19:01.359
of 100,000 so I guess it's
50,000.

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:04.905
So if it's the case that 50,000
of the people in the town are

00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:08.215
your type and 50,000 are the
other type, then you get the

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:10.519
highest possible payoff which is
1.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:14.647
So this is--we're going to
assume that each and every one

00:19:14.647 --> 00:19:19.509
of you has this payoff.
Does that make sense?

00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:23.252
So these are people--let's just
try and get the idea across in

00:19:23.252 --> 00:19:26.566
words--these are people who
would like to live in mixed

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:29.312
towns,
but if they're going to live in

00:19:29.312 --> 00:19:33.096
a town that's not mixed,
they'd rather live in a town in

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:37.519
which they're the majority.
Does that make sense?

00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:40.150
They'd like to live in mixed
towns, but if the town is

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.929
not--if they had a choice
between two towns and the towns

00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:45.907
are not evenly mixed,
then theyd prefer to be in the

00:19:45.907 --> 00:19:49.150
majority town-- the town in
which they're the majority.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.049
Everyone understand this?
It's important;

00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:54.741
since we're about to play this
game, it's important you're all

00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:57.542
on board here.
So to play this game,

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:00.769
I need to put down a few more
rules.

00:20:00.769 --> 00:20:05.500
So the first rule is going to
be that the choice is

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.839
simultaneous and that's a little
unrealistic because in practice,

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:14.134
of course, people choose their
towns sequentially,

00:20:14.134 --> 00:20:15.819
wherever they happen to be
moving,

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.630
but for the moment let's leave
it as that.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.719
Second, I need to just say what
happens if too many people

00:20:22.719 --> 00:20:27.363
choose the same town.
So if there's no room in a

00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:32.774
town, for example,
if too many people chose East

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:38.070
Town then we allocate the
surplus randomly.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:48.965
We ration the places randomly.
So then--we then randomize to

00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:51.329
ration;
people understand that?

00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:55.262
So, for example,
there's 100,000 places in East

00:20:55.262 --> 00:20:59.109
Town, so if 150,000 people chose
East Town,

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:01.720
you're going to have a 2/3
chance of getting into East Town

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.420
and the rest of you is going to
be allocated to West Town.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.587
Does that make sense?
I just need something to make

00:21:07.587 --> 00:21:10.303
things add up.
Okay, so to do this,

00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:14.877
I first of all need to decide
who in the class is tall,

00:21:14.877 --> 00:21:20.043
and who in the class is short
(and I'm going to grab that mike

00:21:20.043 --> 00:21:23.160
again).
So let me just count backwards.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.238
I guess we'll ignore this row.
So, 1,2, 3,4,

00:21:28.238 --> 00:21:36.262
5,6, 7, possibly 8.
Well, maybe this will work,

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:40.350
so up to here this row and
forwards you are short people.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.707
You understand that?
Everyone forward of where I am

00:21:43.707 --> 00:21:46.900
now, this row included,
is short.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.865
The rest of you guys and the
guys in the balcony too,

00:21:49.865 --> 00:21:52.660
who can't see me anymore,
the guys in the balcony,

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.270
you are tall.
Short.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.425
Tall.
Okay, so how many rows of these

00:21:58.425 --> 00:22:01.720
do you have?
One, two, three, four, five.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.577
Seven rows here, all right.
One, two, three,

00:22:05.577 --> 00:22:09.604
four, five, six.
We have seven rows of short

00:22:09.604 --> 00:22:14.696
people and the rest of you are
tall and I'm going to hope I've

00:22:14.696 --> 00:22:17.818
split that evenly.
I'm going to cheat a little

00:22:17.818 --> 00:22:20.201
bit--in a minute,
you're going to have to choose

00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:23.242
which town you're going to live
in and we'll do it by show of

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:25.342
hands.
But before we do that I'm going

00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:28.426
to cheat a little bit by giving
each of you an initial position

00:22:28.426 --> 00:22:31.710
--;this is irrelevant but I just
want to sort of set things up.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:36.886
So what we'll do is we'll put
this row--so this row,

00:22:36.886 --> 00:22:40.236
one, two, three,
four--these rows,

00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:44.500
your initial position is in
East Town.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.442
It doesn't matter,
you can move,

00:22:45.442 --> 00:22:46.779
but your initial position is in
East Town.

00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:50.829
So East, East,
East, East--everyone understand

00:22:50.829 --> 00:22:52.912
that?
These three rows,

00:22:52.912 --> 00:22:55.645
this row, this row,
and this row,

00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:59.625
you're in West Town.
And these next four rows--so

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:03.080
you guys, you guys,
you guys, and you guys--let's

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.245
do it again,
this row, this row,

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:08.044
this row and this row you're at
East Town and--oh,

00:23:08.044 --> 00:23:10.728
I didn't notice this
row--you're in East Town as

00:23:10.728 --> 00:23:12.430
well,
up to here is East Town.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.720
And the rest of you is in West
Town.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.930
Okay, everyone understand where
they are now?

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.990
Let's do a test with the camera
watching.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:25.660
So if you are currently in East
Town raise your hands.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.640
And if you're currently in West
Town raise your hands.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.341
So I've set you up with a
stripy pattern and notice that

00:23:34.341 --> 00:23:39.731
I've set things up so that
slightly more of the short

00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:45.225
people were in East Town and
slightly more of the tall

00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:50.720
people--if I did that
right--were in West Town.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.770
If I did that correctly--I'm
not sure I did actually--but if

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.352
I did that correctly,
slightly more of my short

00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:59.346
people started life in East
Town, and slightly more of my

00:23:59.346 --> 00:24:02.269
tall people started life in West
Town.

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:05.940
Okay, so now think about it a
second.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.900
Remember, these are your
payoffs.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.590
That's a suspension of
disbelief.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.805
These are your payoffs.
And in a minute I want all the

00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:18.650
people who are choosing East
Town to raise their hands.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.289
I'm going to do it at a count
of three and don't cheat.

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:24.010
Don't look around you and see
what's going on.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.306
You all close your eyes.
Everyone in the room close

00:24:28.306 --> 00:24:30.030
their eyes.
I can do anything now;

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.269
I could be stripping naked.
So, you've all got your eyes

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:35.637
closed.
On the count of three,

00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:41.059
anyone who's choosing East Town
should raise their hands 1,2,

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:45.261
3--so this is my East Town.
People can open their eyes now

00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:47.250
and look at the East Town
distribution.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.420
So I've got this big block of
East Town here.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.973
I've got a little bit going on
in the wings,

00:24:50.973 --> 00:24:53.230
a little bit of spillage here.
Let's just make--let's just

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.676
check it so those of you who
didn't raise your hands just now

00:24:55.676 --> 00:24:57.822
are West Town.
So, West Town people raise

00:24:57.822 --> 00:25:01.063
their hands, so we've got a
little bit of spillage here but

00:25:01.063 --> 00:25:03.410
basically I've got West Town
over here.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.580
Everyone understood just what
happened?

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.230
Everyone saw what happened?
Let's do it again.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.460
That's where you are now;
let's see what happens next

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.325
time.
So once again close your eyes,

00:25:13.325 --> 00:25:18.716
don't communicate.
Everybody who's going to choose

00:25:18.716 --> 00:25:23.653
East Town raise their hands now.
So I've got pretty much all of

00:25:23.653 --> 00:25:26.963
these rows now are in East Town
and a little bit of spillage

00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.050
here, but basically I've got
East Town in the front;

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.122
I can't see the balcony.
What do I got in the balcony up

00:25:32.122 --> 00:25:33.240
there?
No hands up in the balcony;

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.569
that's typical.
They live in the balcony, right?

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:40.410
So I've more or less got East
Town here.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.795
Where's my West Town?
Raise your hands if you're in

00:25:42.795 --> 00:25:44.707
West Town now.
West Town: a little bit of

00:25:44.707 --> 00:25:47.309
spillage here but basically I've
got West Town in the back.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:51.033
Let's do it one more time,
everyone understands where

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:53.722
things were just now?
Am I leaving the hands up long

00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:54.740
enough?
Are they up long enough?

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:00.613
Okay, so let's try it again.
So East Town on the count of

00:26:00.613 --> 00:26:03.519
three 1,2, 3.
So here's my East Town.

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:06.858
I'm pretty much in the--among
the East Town dwellers right

00:26:06.858 --> 00:26:09.416
now.
West Town raise your hands 1,2,

00:26:09.416 --> 00:26:11.150
3.
And I'm pretty much in the West

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.700
Town dwellers right now and it's
not at all stripy.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.799
We started up with a stripy
pattern and we ended up--we

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:19.642
ended up how?
We ended up with pretty much

00:26:19.642 --> 00:26:23.039
the whole front of the room
choosing East Town,

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.963
and the whole back of the room,
maybe including the balcony,

00:26:26.963 --> 00:26:30.845
choosing West Town.
The balcony were just flowing

00:26:30.845 --> 00:26:33.839
over.
So everyone saw what happens.

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:36.970
Now, can anyone say what's
happened there?

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.470
Why did we end up like that?
How did we end up like that?

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.960
We started off with a stripy
pattern.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.677
It was a little bit off from
being kind of perfect,

00:26:45.677 --> 00:26:48.122
because all of you,
by these preferences would

00:26:48.122 --> 00:26:50.839
prefer to be in a town that was
exactly 50/50.

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:54.510
It wasn't quite at 50/50 but it
wasn't far off actually and we

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.759
pretty quickly ended up with all
these short people,

00:26:57.759 --> 00:27:01.525
you guys are short all living
in East Town and all of you all

00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:05.813
tall people living in West Town.
So all of you pretty much ended

00:27:05.813 --> 00:27:08.124
up with a payoff of 1/2.
Some of you didn't,

00:27:08.124 --> 00:27:09.630
there are a few deviants.
Who are my deviants?

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.680
Who are my guys--who are my
tall guys who end up East Town?

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.188
So these guys.
It's fine, but they end up with

00:27:16.188 --> 00:27:19.216
a payoff close to 0.
And who are my short deviants

00:27:19.216 --> 00:27:22.079
who ended up in West Town?
There's a few.

00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:23.710
Not many of them at all
actually, but a few of them,

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.150
but they end up with a payoff
of 0 as well.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.920
But pretty much everyone else
was ending up with a payoff

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.882
close to a 1/2,
and splitting down the middle

00:27:31.882 --> 00:27:35.140
of the room.
Now, why?

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.070
What do we call that?
What do we call that process?

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.819
What's the outcome here?
Student: Segregation.

00:27:42.819 --> 00:27:44.210
Professor Ben Polak:
Yeah, so this--say that again.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.717
Student: Segregation
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:27:45.717 --> 00:27:49.273
this is segregation.
Right, we ended up getting the

00:27:49.273 --> 00:27:53.039
class to segregate on tall and
short.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:56.540
It wasn't that people wanted to
segregate.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.841
I gave you the preferences.
I told you that you have to

00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:02.206
have these preferences,
which may have actually been

00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:04.710
the preferences that favored
being in a mixed town,

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.764
but we very quickly settled
down to a segregated

00:28:08.764 --> 00:28:11.740
distribution of the class.
Why?

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.293
What led to that?
Let's just talk it through a

00:28:14.293 --> 00:28:15.933
bit.
Who has an opinion of what it

00:28:15.933 --> 00:28:18.408
was that kind of got us there.
Yes, so Patrick shout out for

00:28:18.408 --> 00:28:21.210
the classroom.
This doesn't speak to the class.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.830
Student: I mean,
I think what happened is

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.900
basically because it was the
first choice is simultaneous.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.645
Everyone in the slightly bad
situation all changed to what

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:31.339
was perceived to be a better
situation.

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:35.000
So we sort of shot past the
equilibrium where we were 50/50.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.933
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so we--I cheated a little

00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:40.718
bit by starting you off away
from the 50/50 point and you

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:43.559
kind of went further very,
very quickly.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:47.600
Now, I want to say that I think
with a longer time period to

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.230
play with I could have started
you off just random,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.763
just choose whatever,
and if we played enough times

00:28:53.763 --> 00:28:56.549
my guess is we would have ended
up segregated anyway.

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:58.714
It might not have been
segregated with East here and

00:28:58.714 --> 00:29:00.880
West there, might have been the
other way around,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.319
but I'm pretty sure we'd have
ended up segregated anyway.

00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:06.036
I can't prove that because I
can't--we wouldn't have enough

00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:08.775
time to do it.
I cheated by pushing us that

00:29:08.775 --> 00:29:10.678
way.
So what happened was--is this

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:13.481
right?
People who started off in the

00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:18.617
minority but not badly in the
minority in--who were short guys

00:29:18.617 --> 00:29:22.070
in West Town--they moved to East
Town.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:26.539
That was largely the rows here;
you guys moved to West Town.

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:29.918
And guys who ended up--who I
started off in the minority--I'm

00:29:29.918 --> 00:29:33.410
not even sure it was actually a
minority--who were tall guys in

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.170
East Town you guys drifted over
to West Town.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.715
Is that right?
Okay, we'll talk about this

00:29:39.715 --> 00:29:41.888
more in a second,
but let's just get some ideas

00:29:41.888 --> 00:29:44.769
down on the board.
Well, no--I don't know.

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:48.190
Actually, while I'm down here
let's do a little bit more work.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.413
So before we leave this,
I mean before we leave talking

00:29:52.413 --> 00:29:56.950
about it, let's figure out what
are the equilibria here.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.330
So what's an equilibrium of
this game?

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.994
It's a pretty simple game.
It has lots of people,

00:30:00.994 --> 00:30:03.967
two choices per person.
We're going to be doing guess

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:05.450
and check here.
So what do people think the

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.458
equilibrium is?
Let me get someone who hasn't

00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.321
spoken yet.
I surely shouldn't have to cold

00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:11.350
call here.
This is an easy one.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.080
What's an equilibrium here?
Somebody?

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.980
What's an equilibrium here?
How about the gentleman here.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.130
You want to have a guess at
what the equilibrium is?

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.599
Student: Everyone being
segregated.

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.590
Professor Ben Polak:
Everyone being segregated.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.032
Let's be a bit more precise.
So I claim there's two ways

00:30:23.032 --> 00:30:26.779
they can be segregated.
So spell out the two ways.

00:30:26.779 --> 00:30:29.666
Student: If all of the
tall people are in West Town and

00:30:29.666 --> 00:30:31.559
all the short people are in East
Town,

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:35.001
or if all the tall people are
in the West Town and the other

00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:36.246
way around.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:37.230
Good and your name is?
Student: Greg.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.165
Professor Ben Polak: So
Greg is saying there's two ways

00:30:40.165 --> 00:30:43.150
to be segregated and each of
them seems like an equilibrium.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:45.938
Let's just spell it out.
So all the tall people being in

00:30:45.938 --> 00:30:48.877
the East is one equilibrium,
and all the tall people being

00:30:48.877 --> 00:30:50.940
in the West is the other
equilibrium.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.886
Both of those,
I claim--or Greg claims a bit

00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:58.339
more carefully--Greg claims both
of those are Nash Equilibrium.

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:01.740
How do we check that they're
Nash Equilibrium?

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.729
I mean they are,
you're right,

00:31:03.729 --> 00:31:07.569
but how do we check that they
are in fact equilibrium?

00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:09.599
How do we go about checking
that they're equilibrium?

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:11.927
The guessing part is easy,
checking requires a bit of

00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:14.670
thought, so how do we check?
Yeah.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.160
Student: You check for
profitable deviation.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.480
Professor Ben Polak: You
check for profitable deviations.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.233
So what's a deviation here?
If all the short people are at

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:27.272
East Town and all the tall
people are at West Town,

00:31:27.272 --> 00:31:30.956
what's a deviation?
A deviation--let's ignore the

00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:34.638
capacity constraints for a
minute--a deviation is for one

00:31:34.638 --> 00:31:37.400
of the short guys to move to
West Town.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.530
Is that right?
So at the equilibrium that

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.440
short guy was getting a payoff
of what?

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.780
What was his or her payoff in
equilibrium?

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.446
One half.
If he or she deviates and moves

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:51.223
to West Town,
again ignoring the capacity

00:31:51.223 --> 00:31:53.509
constraints,
let's assume that they can,

00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:56.990
if that short person moves to
West Town what's their payoff

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.349
going to be?
Zero.

00:31:58.349 --> 00:32:00.079
So that's not a profitable
deviation.

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:02.425
Conversely, if we did the same
from the other side for the tall

00:32:02.425 --> 00:32:03.750
people, we'd find the same
thing.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.873
So we've just checked that that
is an equilibrium because nobody

00:32:07.873 --> 00:32:11.870
can deviate profitably.
So we found two equilibria here

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.450
and as people pointed out they
are segregated.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.130
Now, I claim that there's
another equilibrium here.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.839
What's the other equilibrium
here?

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:23.900
I should get the mike right
there on the other side.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.740
So let me try and lean in here,
lean my way.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.589
Yeah can you--thanks.
Student: If you were to

00:32:31.589 --> 00:32:34.539
put exactly 50/50 then that
would be an equilibrium.

00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:38.814
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so if the crowd had split

00:32:38.814 --> 00:32:41.910
50/50 that would also be an
equilibrium.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.680
Right, but the key word there
is what?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.120
The key--50/50 is the key word.
What's the other key word there?

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.690
Exact;
it really has to be exact for

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.955
this to work.
And since I'm hand waving a bit

00:32:53.955 --> 00:32:55.842
because equilibrium are always
exact statements,

00:32:55.842 --> 00:32:57.569
but can people see what's going
on here?

00:32:57.569 --> 00:33:00.696
So if people split exactly
50/50, right split the class

00:33:00.696 --> 00:33:04.285
down the middle--I start off by
splitting it this way into tall

00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:07.527
people and short people--if I
had split the town down the

00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:10.366
middle into East and West,
then everyone would have been

00:33:10.366 --> 00:33:11.660
happy and they would have stayed
put.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.769
That's this gentleman's claim
and I think that's correct.

00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:19.232
But what's suspicious if you
like, what's worrying about that

00:33:19.232 --> 00:33:21.740
equilibrium?
That is an equilibrium.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.355
What's worrying about that
equilibrium, that mixed

00:33:24.355 --> 00:33:26.650
equilibrium, that integrated
equilibrium?

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:32.384
Can we get the guy here?
Student: It's a weak

00:33:32.384 --> 00:33:35.583
Nash Equilibrium because while
there's no real incentive for

00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:37.915
you to deviate,
there's no incentive for you to

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.671
not deviate either.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:41.435
Good, so one thing that
distinguishes--thank you that's

00:33:41.435 --> 00:33:43.628
very good.
So one thing that distinguishes

00:33:43.628 --> 00:33:46.651
that equilibrium from the
equilibria that we were just

00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:48.990
looking at is it--sometimes it's
weak,

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.190
whereas, the other ones are
strict.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.302
What do we mean by that?
If we deviate away from this

00:33:53.302 --> 00:33:56.147
exactly mixed equilibrium,
roughly speaking,

00:33:56.147 --> 00:33:58.529
a little bit of hand waving
here,

00:33:58.529 --> 00:34:02.599
but roughly speaking we're
exactly indifferent.

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:05.169
It's true, that's not strictly
true because I guess by

00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:08.030
ourselves moving we're changing
the balance a little bit,

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.828
but nevertheless we know if I
smooth out the top it'll we'll

00:34:10.828 --> 00:34:13.888
be exactly right.
So at that mixed equilibrium--I

00:34:13.888 --> 00:34:18.065
don't want to call it a mixed
equilibrium--at that integrated

00:34:18.065 --> 00:34:20.722
equilibrium,
I'm exactly indifferent about

00:34:20.722 --> 00:34:23.280
where I live,
both towns look the same to me.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.011
They're called East and West
but they have the same mixture

00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:27.659
of tall and short people in
them.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:33.373
Whereas, at the segregated
equilibria, I strictly prefer to

00:34:33.373 --> 00:34:37.610
go to the town in which I'm the
majority.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.051
I'm doing a strictly higher
payoff, 1/2 versus 0,

00:34:41.051 --> 00:34:44.780
by being in the town in which
I'm in the majority.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.123
So there's this notion of
strictness, there's also a

00:34:48.123 --> 00:34:51.598
notion of stability here,
so again, I don't want to be

00:34:51.598 --> 00:34:54.530
too formal here.
I want to give you an informal

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.070
idea about why we might worry
about stability.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.409
So what do I mean by stability
here?

00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:02.768
Why do I think that that
integrated equilibrium in which

00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:06.730
we divide the towns equally
might not be stable?

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.861
What do we mean by that?
For the physicists this is an

00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:11.364
easy idea, but for everyone I
think it's a fairly intuitive

00:35:11.364 --> 00:35:15.451
idea.
Why is that not likely to be

00:35:15.451 --> 00:35:18.050
stable?
Anybody?

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.510
Yeah here.
What's your name?

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:21.158
Student: Chris.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:35:21.158 --> 00:35:22.180
why?
Student: If even one

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.981
person deviates and all of a
sudden then everyone would

00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:25.949
prefer to deviate to the
completely segregated position.

00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:26.630
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, good.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.317
So at that integrated
equilibria, if we move away from

00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:33.099
it a little bit,
if it turns out that,

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:39.412
let's say, one town has 5% more
short people and the other town

00:35:39.412 --> 00:35:43.949
has 5% more tall people,
then in some sense we're in

00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:46.838
trouble already.
We haven't gone very far from

00:35:46.838 --> 00:35:50.177
this nice equilibrium but
already we're in trouble because

00:35:50.177 --> 00:35:53.692
now all of the short people are
going to prefer East Town and

00:35:53.692 --> 00:35:57.090
all of the tall people are going
to prefer West Town.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.216
And in a few moves we're very
quickly going to be back at

00:36:01.216 --> 00:36:04.092
segregation again.
It's not stable in the sense

00:36:04.092 --> 00:36:07.099
that if we were a little bit off
we're going to go a long way

00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:09.016
off.
Again, I'm not being formal

00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:11.860
here but the informal idea I
think is important.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.323
Conversely, those segregated
equilibria, because they were

00:36:16.323 --> 00:36:19.448
strict equilibria,
as the gentleman over there was

00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:21.710
pointing out,
they're already pretty stable.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:26.565
If we start close to 100% short
people in East and close to 100%

00:36:26.565 --> 00:36:31.190
tall people in West and then we
move it a little bit away,

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.617
so I shake you up a bit and I
force you to--I reallocate a few

00:36:34.617 --> 00:36:38.320
people and then let you play,
I claim you'll go back to that

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.820
equilibrium.
Is that right?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.495
So, the equilibrium that is
integrated here,

00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:46.544
it is an equilibrium,
it's only a weak equilibrium

00:36:46.544 --> 00:36:49.219
and it's not very stable in some
sense.

00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:53.008
Whereas, the segregated
equilibria, they're clearly

00:36:53.008 --> 00:36:56.039
strict equilibria and they are
stable.

00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:59.438
Let's put some of this down on
the board now,

00:36:59.438 --> 00:37:03.455
partly because it feels weird
for me being out there,

00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:16.389
even if it doesn't for you.
So, we've got this several

00:37:16.389 --> 00:37:24.622
equilibria here;
we've got at least three and

00:37:24.622 --> 00:37:27.450
we'll come back and talk about
whether there are others in a

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.932
minute.
We've got at least three

00:37:29.932 --> 00:37:33.269
equilibria, two of them are
segregated.

00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:43.416
So the Nash Equilibrium in this
game--we have two segregated

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:52.874
Nash Equilibria and these
correspond to tall in East and

00:37:52.874 --> 00:38:03.994
short in West and vice versa.
We had a separate one which was

00:38:03.994 --> 00:38:13.654
an integrated one which was
roughly half of each in each

00:38:13.654 --> 00:38:16.111
town.
So there's at least three

00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:17.920
equilibria here,
although the two segregated

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.127
ones are kind of the same,
and we argued that these

00:38:22.127 --> 00:38:29.595
segregated equilibria were in
some sense stable and they were

00:38:29.595 --> 00:38:37.188
strict equilibria in the sense
that you strictly preferred not

00:38:37.188 --> 00:38:40.962
to deviate.
Whereas, these integrated

00:38:40.962 --> 00:38:44.670
equilibria, these were actually
perhaps not stable,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.356
and again I'm not being formal
here, so I was being a bit

00:38:48.356 --> 00:38:50.989
careful putting it in inverted
commas,

00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:58.638
and again, a little bit
informal but a kind of weak

00:38:58.638 --> 00:39:02.623
equilibrium.
Now, I want to bring up one

00:39:02.623 --> 00:39:06.037
other concept here,
which is the idea of a "tipping

00:39:06.037 --> 00:39:07.894
point."
So this is a game that was

00:39:07.894 --> 00:39:09.610
introduced by a guy called
Schelling.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.099
Schelling went on to win the
Nobel Prize largely for this;

00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:16.449
certainly in large part for
this idea.

00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:19.519
This is a game that has a
tipping point.

00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:23.114
There are really two stable
equilibria, the segregation of

00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:25.889
one way and the segregation the
other way,

00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:29.300
and in between there's a
tipping point beyond which if

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.160
you--beyond which--if you go
beyond which you go to the other

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.934
equilibrium.
I said that very badly,

00:39:34.934 --> 00:39:38.100
but do people get the idea?
There are two strict equilibria

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.547
and if we got beyond the points
of a 50/50 mix going the other

00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:46.119
way, we can whiz off to the
other equilibrium.

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:49.002
We already saw a game that had
a tipping point when we played

00:39:49.002 --> 00:39:51.205
the investment game,
where there were two

00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:54.642
equilibria, all invest and no
one invest, there was a natural

00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:57.964
tipping point in that game and
the tipping point was having

00:39:57.964 --> 00:40:00.987
exactly 90% of you invest,
the point at which you actually

00:40:00.987 --> 00:40:03.280
would want to flip over and go
to the other equilibrium.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.780
So this is a game that has a
tipping point.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.328
We can push people away from
the equilibrium and they'll go

00:40:12.328 --> 00:40:14.964
on coming back and they'll go on
coming back and go on coming

00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:16.262
back,
but if we just push them a

00:40:16.262 --> 00:40:18.102
little bit beyond a half,
whoops, they'll go on off to

00:40:18.102 --> 00:40:22.090
the other equilibrium;
very dramatic change.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:26.327
That seems like a rather
important idea in,

00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:28.849
for example,
sociology.

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:31.487
So I've got these segregated
equilibria and I've got these

00:40:31.487 --> 00:40:34.171
integrated equilibria and let's
just make the other obvious

00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:38.139
remark.
Which of these equilibrium is

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:43.286
preferred by the population?
Would they rather be in the

00:40:43.286 --> 00:40:46.346
integrated equilibrium,
given that these are their

00:40:46.346 --> 00:40:48.969
payoffs, or the segregated
equilibrium?

00:40:48.969 --> 00:40:51.420
They'd rather be in the
integrated one.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.820
So here's a world in which
they'd like to be in

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.159
the--everybody would like to be
in the integrated equilibrium.

00:40:57.159 --> 00:40:59.750
This is not a Prisoner's
Dilemma.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.713
This is not a case that we've
seen before but it turns out

00:41:03.713 --> 00:41:07.329
that you're likely to end up in
these inefficient,

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:12.239
less preferred by everybody,
segregated equilibria.

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:16.751
However, if we're subtle about
this, you might notice there's

00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:20.059
actually a third equilibrium in
this game.

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:22.376
If we're a little bit nerdy,
there's actually another

00:41:22.376 --> 00:41:25.247
equilibrium in this game.
So, I'll need to give you your

00:41:25.247 --> 00:41:31.909
mike back, I'm sorry.
There's a guy there in gray.

00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:34.527
Student: If everyone
chooses one town or the other,

00:41:34.527 --> 00:41:36.501
regardless of whether they're
tall or short,

00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:38.199
then they would be
redistributed.

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:39.590
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, your name is?

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.122
Student: Nick.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:41:41.122 --> 00:41:43.121
Nick;
so Nick's pointing out there's

00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:45.960
actually hidden in here another
equilibrium.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.937
It doesn't sound like anything
very realistic,

00:41:47.937 --> 00:41:50.487
but let's just focus on it a
second because I think it's an

00:41:50.487 --> 00:41:52.659
important lesson here.
There's going to turn out to be

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:55.035
important lessons.
The other equilibrium

00:41:55.035 --> 00:41:59.107
is--actually there's two of
them--is if everybody,

00:41:59.107 --> 00:42:04.010
everyone in the room chose East
Town, what would happen?

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.967
Well, we'd have to find a way
of assigning everybody,

00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:10.208
so what we would do is we'd
essentially randomize over the

00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:13.677
room and half the room would be
in East Town and half the room

00:42:13.677 --> 00:42:16.751
would be in West Town.
So there's this kind of silly

00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:19.510
equilibrium in a sense,
in which everyone does the same

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.565
thing,
and the way in which people

00:42:22.565 --> 00:42:28.622
actually get allocated is not by
their choice but by this detail

00:42:28.622 --> 00:42:32.831
of the original game,
which was if there was

00:42:32.831 --> 00:42:36.980
overcrowding we were going to
randomize people.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:43.564
So, there is actually a third
equilibrium which is

00:42:43.564 --> 00:42:51.357
all--there's two of these of
course--so all choose the same

00:42:51.357 --> 00:42:56.132
town and get randomized.
To check that is an

00:42:56.132 --> 00:42:59.117
equilibrium, notice that if
everyone else is choosing--if

00:42:59.117 --> 00:43:02.208
everyone else is playing this
strategy of all choosing East

00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:04.873
Town and allowing the
randomization device to place

00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:07.363
you,
then you're completely happy to

00:43:07.363 --> 00:43:10.310
do that, completely happy to do
the same thing.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:14.863
So it is in fact an equilibrium.
So, this is a slightly odd

00:43:14.863 --> 00:43:17.762
equilibrium here,
and there's immediately a Game

00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:19.870
Theory lesson here.
This equilibrium,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.857
sounds like something we might
see in society,

00:43:21.857 --> 00:43:23.799
and this one's certainly worth
talking about,

00:43:23.799 --> 00:43:25.610
it seems a natural part of the
game.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.400
This equilibrium seems to have
nothing to do with anything

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.388
that's really in the world.
It's just arising from a

00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:35.178
particular detail I threw into
the model at the end to make

00:43:35.178 --> 00:43:36.739
things add up.
Is that right?

00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:39.388
When I was setting up this
model and describing reality,

00:43:39.388 --> 00:43:42.277
I threw this in at the end to
say we better do something just

00:43:42.277 --> 00:43:45.664
to make things add up,
otherwise towns are going to be

00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:47.821
overcrowded.
It wasn't that's really out

00:43:47.821 --> 00:43:50.385
there in the real world.
It was just to make it a game,

00:43:50.385 --> 00:43:51.920
sort of define things
carefully.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.825
This seemingly innocent detail
of my modeling technique threw

00:43:56.825 --> 00:44:01.676
up another equilibrium.
So there's a sort of warning

00:44:01.676 --> 00:44:04.455
lesson here.
The lesson is,

00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:10.674
seemingly irrelevant details of
the game, things that aren't

00:44:10.674 --> 00:44:14.679
really attempts to capture
reality,

00:44:14.679 --> 00:44:18.051
they're just trying to get
things through in a hurry,

00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.320
can end up mattering--can
matter.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.912
They can lead your game to give
you a prediction you really

00:44:23.912 --> 00:44:25.550
don't believe in.
Is that right?

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.969
Well, that's a very general
lesson for those of you who are

00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:31.739
going to go out and model things
more widely.

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:34.469
There's a second lesson here,
however.

00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:38.013
The second lesson here is if in
fact, if this randomization

00:44:38.013 --> 00:44:41.662
process was available,
if in fact it was possible for

00:44:41.662 --> 00:44:45.736
everyone in the town to chose
East Town and then have the

00:44:45.736 --> 00:44:49.817
local government randomize you,
then if we use the law of large

00:44:49.817 --> 00:44:52.980
numbers, if there's 100,000--I
guess 200,000 people in all and

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.886
they're all being randomized,
we're going to end up very,

00:44:56.886 --> 00:45:01.877
very close in the limit exactly
at integration and everyone's

00:45:01.877 --> 00:45:05.840
going to be better off.
Is that right?

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.955
So the other kind of strange
thing here is by

00:45:09.955 --> 00:45:13.323
randomizing--wll,
I don't want to say

00:45:13.323 --> 00:45:21.344
randomizing,
I want to say having society

00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:31.597
randomize for you--ended up
being better than

00:45:31.597 --> 00:45:42.686
choosing--ended up better than,
what you might want to call

00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:46.750
"active choice."
Here's an example of a place

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:51.482
where by abdicating the right to
choose my town and simply by all

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:55.621
choosing East,
having society randomize for

00:45:55.621 --> 00:46:01.590
me, we ended up better off:
a slightly surprising result.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.350
Let's try and push this a
little harder.

00:46:26.519 --> 00:46:30.610
Okay, so let's try and draw
some lessons.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:33.695
We've drawn out some Game
Theory lessons already from this

00:46:33.695 --> 00:46:36.780
about irrelevant details and
about stability and so on.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.760
Let's try and draw out some
other lessons here.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.760
So, one lesson might be a
lesson in sociology.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.380
I'm not a sociologist so I want
to be careful.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:53.000
I'll put it in inverted commas.
The sociological lesson is what?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.343
In this game,
segregation is what resulted,

00:46:56.343 --> 00:46:59.210
at least in the stable
equilibria,

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:03.096
and you might be tempted if
you're an empirical sociologist,

00:47:03.096 --> 00:47:06.965
to go around the world and say,
look I see segregation

00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:09.509
everywhere.
I've gone from country to

00:47:09.509 --> 00:47:13.138
country, from society to
society, and wherever I go I see

00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:15.644
segregation.
You might be tempted to

00:47:15.644 --> 00:47:19.445
conclude that that's because
people prefer segregation and

00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:22.295
that might be right.
Nothing in this model disproves

00:47:22.295 --> 00:47:24.031
that.
It might be the facts that--it

00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:26.549
might in fact be in the case
that the reason you see

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:29.511
segregation in virtually every
society is because segregation

00:47:29.511 --> 00:47:32.092
is preferred.
I'm not ruling that out here

00:47:32.092 --> 00:47:34.390
I'm just raising another
possibility.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.856
What's the other possibility?
The other possibility is it

00:47:36.856 --> 00:47:40.389
could be that preferences are
like this, roughly speaking.

00:47:40.389 --> 00:47:44.950
People don't actually prefer
segregation, but when all people

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.739
act in their own interest you
end up with segregation anyway.

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:57.706
So, the fact that that we're
seeing segregation in this model

00:47:57.706 --> 00:48:05.539
does not imply that there's a
preference for segregation.

00:48:05.539 --> 00:48:09.521
It doesn't rule it out,
of course, but you can't

00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:14.351
conclude, just because you see
segregation everywhere that

00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:17.739
necessarily people want
segregation.

00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:20.426
Let me just take that outside
of the context of segregation,

00:48:20.426 --> 00:48:23.032
more generally.
If you see a social phenomenon

00:48:23.032 --> 00:48:26.391
in society after society,
after society whether they are

00:48:26.391 --> 00:48:29.934
anthropologists going across
societies or a historian going

00:48:29.934 --> 00:48:32.500
through societies in historical
time,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.280
and you see the same phenomenon
in each of these societies which

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.880
results from the choices of
thousands of different people,

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.311
you can't conclude from the
fact that you see it in all of

00:48:43.311 --> 00:48:46.079
these societies that those
people prefer it.

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.491
All you know is that each of
their individual choices add up

00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.903
to this social outcome that may
or may not be something they

00:48:52.903 --> 00:48:55.849
prefer.
In this case it's not.

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:58.929
That was really Schelling's big
idea.

00:48:58.929 --> 00:49:01.638
I don't want to write that all
out but it's kind of a--it's a

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:05.659
huge idea.
It got him the Nobel Prize.

00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:10.620
So you don't want to conclude
from observation straight back

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.320
to preference in these strategic
settings.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:19.755
Now, this matters a little bit,
obviously in our own society

00:49:19.755 --> 00:49:24.269
because we live in a rather
segregated society.

00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:27.548
I mean, we needn't be quite so
coy as to talk about tall people

00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:30.867
and short people all the time,
what we're really talking about

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:33.650
mostly I guess in our society is
ethnic segregation,

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.437
and we see this very
dramatically in Connecticut,

00:49:36.437 --> 00:49:39.463
for example.
So where we live in New Haven,

00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:43.670
at least if you go a few feet
outside of the university,

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.317
and actually where people live
in New Haven,

00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:49.519
we see that New Haven is a
fairly integrated town.

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:54.628
It's not a hundred-percent
integrated town but it has a

00:49:54.628 --> 00:49:57.940
fairly wide array of
ethnicities.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.576
But if you go upstate in
Connecticut, if you go north,

00:50:00.576 --> 00:50:03.014
ignoring Hartford,
if you go in the rural areas of

00:50:03.014 --> 00:50:05.507
Connecticut,
you find something dramatically

00:50:05.507 --> 00:50:07.800
different.
How many of you have traveled

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.570
around in rural Connecticut?
Some of you have.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.269
So it's quite shocking for me
as a foreigner when I came here.

00:50:13.269 --> 00:50:15.453
So New Haven and the towns
along the coast are fairly

00:50:15.453 --> 00:50:17.048
integrated but,
if you drive into rural

00:50:17.048 --> 00:50:19.190
Connecticut, you see something
quite different.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.594
So this weekend,
for example,

00:50:20.594 --> 00:50:23.298
I was up at the Durham Fair.
How many of you know what the

00:50:23.298 --> 00:50:24.389
Durham Fair is?
Some of you know.

00:50:24.389 --> 00:50:25.380
The Durham Fair is actually
very good.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.119
It's a place where you
can--it's the biggest

00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.465
agricultural fair in Connecticut
and you can take your kids

00:50:29.465 --> 00:50:31.263
there,
I have a four-year old and a

00:50:31.263 --> 00:50:33.404
two-year old,
and they discover at this fair

00:50:33.404 --> 00:50:36.740
that in fact it is the case that
cows say moo and sheep say baa.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.760
Who knew?
Right, that's a good thing.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.970
So I don't want to knock the
Durham Fair.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.998
I think it's a good thing.
But if you're wandering around

00:50:43.998 --> 00:50:46.802
the Durham Fair and you're a
social scientist as I am I

00:50:46.802 --> 00:50:49.621
guess,
you can't help but be struck

00:50:49.621 --> 00:50:53.820
by--how do I put this without
getting in trouble?

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.349
You would find more ethnic
diversity at a Klan rally.

00:50:58.349 --> 00:51:01.224
This is not--I mean this
is--that's not going to get me

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:03.216
out of trouble.
There's got to be some way of

00:51:03.216 --> 00:51:04.789
saying that it doesn't get me in
trouble.

00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:07.320
Okay, but you know what I mean,
right?

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.567
It is strikingly,
strikingly white at the Durham

00:51:11.567 --> 00:51:14.295
Fair.
We're only--what--it's about--I

00:51:14.295 --> 00:51:16.730
think it's 18 miles from New
Haven.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.880
It's a 20 minute drive from
here.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.360
It's a public event,
20 miles from New Haven.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.524
So this is a phenomenon one
might be tempted to say,

00:51:26.524 --> 00:51:29.642
this is because people choose,
people want-- clearly,

00:51:29.642 --> 00:51:32.010
people are choosing to go to
the Durham Fair;

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.630
they're choosing to some extent
where they live in Connecticut.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.494
And you might think the fact
that we see this incredibly

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:40.358
dramatic segregation between
activities in New Haven and

00:51:40.358 --> 00:51:43.119
activities 20 miles away is
evidence that people might

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:46.322
actually prefer segregation.
And just to repeat,

00:51:46.322 --> 00:51:49.523
I can't prove that it isn't.
But we have to be at least

00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:51.861
aware of the possibility that
it's got nothing to do with the

00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:54.699
preference for segregation;
it could be the preferences

00:51:54.699 --> 00:51:57.765
look like the preferences above.
It could be that simply

00:51:57.765 --> 00:52:00.130
thousands of activities by
thousands of individuals,

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.841
who at least would prefer to be
in the majority than the--they'd

00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:04.949
rather be in the majority and
not the minority,

00:52:04.949 --> 00:52:08.915
but they'd like to be
integrated--leads to incredible

00:52:08.915 --> 00:52:14.449
segregation in the aggregate.
So let's talk about policy now.

00:52:14.449 --> 00:52:17.700
So as I go down here I'm
getting more and more in trouble

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.879
I'm sure as a foreigner.
This is a big policy question

00:52:20.879 --> 00:52:23.194
in the U.S.
How many of you are unaware of

00:52:23.194 --> 00:52:26.010
the fact this is a big policy
question in the U.S.?

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:32.485
So at least since the 1960s
this issue about segregation

00:52:32.485 --> 00:52:37.901
versus integration has been a
hot-button issue,

00:52:37.901 --> 00:52:43.199
particularly in what part of
social life?

00:52:43.199 --> 00:52:45.070
Student: Schools bussing
for segregating schools.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.483
Professor Ben Polak:
Schooling okay,

00:52:46.483 --> 00:52:47.789
your name sorry?
Student: Jessica.

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:50.153
Professor Ben Polak: So
Jessica's pointing out correctly

00:52:50.153 --> 00:52:52.329
that since the 1960s,
this has been an incredibly hot

00:52:52.329 --> 00:52:54.215
issue in the U.S.,
and we're talking about the

00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:57.469
bussing debate.
How many of you have not heard

00:52:57.469 --> 00:53:00.393
of bussing?
How many of you have heard of

00:53:00.393 --> 00:53:02.803
bussing?
So it's slightly a policy

00:53:02.803 --> 00:53:06.213
debate of the 1960s so people
tend to forget it,

00:53:06.213 --> 00:53:10.241
but in the 1960s and early 70s,
people were so worried about

00:53:10.241 --> 00:53:13.475
segregation in schools that
they--that children were bussed

00:53:13.475 --> 00:53:17.099
from one neighborhood to another
neighborhood to go to school.

00:53:17.099 --> 00:53:19.630
This was an incredibly
controversial issue in the U.S..

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:21.550
And I'm not--I don't want to
take a position on it here.

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:24.968
I just want to point out that
you could arrive at that policy

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:27.190
by thinking about this kind of
model.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.289
In fact, this is not just an
issue of history.

00:53:30.289 --> 00:53:34.026
If you read the newspapers last
week, including the Yale

00:53:34.026 --> 00:53:38.150
Daily, you'll see that it's
an issue today in Connecticut.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:41.292
There's a worry in Connecticut
today, particularly around

00:53:41.292 --> 00:53:44.659
Hartford, that the schools are
still illegally segregated.

00:53:44.659 --> 00:53:47.980
They're not in compliance with
the law.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.500
So this continues to be an
issue.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.877
Let me take to a slightly less
contentious area,

00:53:52.877 --> 00:53:56.974
since that's obviously so
contentious, and talk about--and

00:53:56.974 --> 00:54:00.280
try and relate it back to the
model a bit.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.472
So in the model what we saw was
if everyone chose to go to East

00:54:04.472 --> 00:54:07.650
Town or if everyone chose to go
to West Town,

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:12.059
there was a policy that was a
little bit like bussing going

00:54:12.059 --> 00:54:14.077
on.
If everyone chose to go East

00:54:14.077 --> 00:54:17.703
Town, what we ended up with was
randomized placement across the

00:54:17.703 --> 00:54:19.590
towns.
Is that right?

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.789
That's a little bit like the
bussing policy.

00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:26.250
It says everybody--we take away
people who we--take away

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.953
people's active choice of their
school and in place we just

00:54:30.953 --> 00:54:34.241
randomize everybody.
So leaving aside what happened

00:54:34.241 --> 00:54:36.120
in Connecticut,
let's think about a school,

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.401
not a very good school,
but a school that's a little

00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:41.506
bit north of here.
So there's this school called

00:54:41.506 --> 00:54:45.802
Harvard and so that's--Harvard
is outside Boston and at least

00:54:45.802 --> 00:54:48.810
when I was there as a graduate
student,

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:53.708
this was a hot issue in Harvard.
So whereas Yale has colleges,

00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:58.500
Harvard has "houses," but
they're the same thing.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.615
They are the same thing;
it's just the same name for

00:55:03.615 --> 00:55:05.772
they're--maybe they're not the
same, maybe there's some subtle

00:55:05.772 --> 00:55:07.860
difference--but they're roughly
speaking the same thing.

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:14.146
I'm still getting hissed.
So these houses at Harvard,

00:55:14.146 --> 00:55:17.329
at least until about 1990 I
think, roughly,

00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:21.269
certainly when I was there as a
graduate student,

00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.996
the way in which you ended up
at a particular house was that

00:55:25.996 --> 00:55:30.477
you chose which house to be in.
Harvard administrators started

00:55:30.477 --> 00:55:32.911
worrying.
So these houses started

00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:37.030
looking--started taking on
certain characteristics.

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:39.292
So, for example,
there was a house--I guess

00:55:39.292 --> 00:55:41.340
there still is--called Elliot
House,

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.528
and if you went to,
as I used to occasionally as a

00:55:43.528 --> 00:55:45.583
graduate student,
go and eat a dinner at Elliot

00:55:45.583 --> 00:55:47.659
House,
you'd meet all these people.

00:55:47.659 --> 00:55:49.899
And it was kind of an odd
experience because more than

00:55:49.899 --> 00:55:52.518
half of them had names that just
happened to be the same as the

00:55:52.518 --> 00:55:54.800
swimming pool that had just been
built at Harvard.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.456
Then if you went to Adams
House, where I was actually a

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:03.510
tutor, it was a very different
mix of people.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.761
And an extraordinary large
portion of them were daughters

00:56:07.761 --> 00:56:11.329
of recently deposed Latin
American dictators.

00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:14.010
It's not exactly what you
expect to meet at random.

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:16.876
And then to give you a third
example, there was a house

00:56:16.876 --> 00:56:18.894
called--it's wrong now,
Kirkland House,

00:56:18.894 --> 00:56:20.909
is that right?
Kirkland House.

00:56:20.909 --> 00:56:24.460
And Kirkland House was known to
be the jock house,

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.502
the athlete house,
and of course this being

00:56:27.502 --> 00:56:31.559
Harvard that meant that everyone
there was Canadian.

00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:35.559
So this was--this worried the
Harvard administrators.

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:39.374
So they were worried about it
and presumably they were worried

00:56:39.374 --> 00:56:42.250
that little Ms.
Pinochet wasn't going to have a

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.440
chance to meet Mr.
Master Gretzky or something,

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.827
whatever it was.
So they did something about it,

00:56:48.827 --> 00:56:51.194
so what did they do?
What did the Harvard

00:56:51.194 --> 00:56:54.300
administrator so to change this
outcome?

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:58.380
Anyone know?
Shout it out.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.170
Student: They randomized
it.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.535
So you go in as a group but you
don't get to choose which one

00:57:01.535 --> 00:57:03.893
you're going to go into.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:03.893 --> 00:57:06.659
Right, so what happened was they
imposed randomization.

00:57:06.659 --> 00:57:10.880
They did exactly the policy
that we described up here.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:13.767
This was essentially their
policy and notice actually the

00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:16.823
policy that they adopted,
the policy in which house

00:57:16.823 --> 00:57:20.350
allocation was random,
was basically going to what the

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:24.586
policy Yale had all along.
So as happens in other cases in

00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:29.050
education, Harvard arrived at
the Yale solution eventually.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:34.135
So randomization or more
dramatic things like bussing are

00:57:34.135 --> 00:57:39.403
policies arrived at really
because we know of the existence

00:57:39.403 --> 00:57:42.134
of these models.
I'm not saying these are right

00:57:42.134 --> 00:57:43.227
or wrong.;
It's not my position to say

00:57:43.227 --> 00:57:45.970
that they're right and wrong.
I'm saying if you were going to

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.220
argue for these policies,
this might be a way in which

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.550
you might argue for these
policies.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.661
Now, I want to bring out the
third lesson here,

00:57:54.661 --> 00:57:58.653
and the third lesson here is
once--we've drawn--I've already

00:57:58.653 --> 00:58:02.591
said I won't repeat it,
there's a Game Theory lesson

00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:06.880
here about irrelevant details;
irrelevant details mattering,

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.780
but I want to bring out one
more Game Theory lesson here.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:16.429
So here we've been discussing
randomization in these settings

00:58:16.429 --> 00:58:19.454
in the following form.
In the game,

00:58:19.454 --> 00:58:22.639
the local governments
randomized where you lived.

00:58:22.639 --> 00:58:26.116
In the bussing experiment it
was randomly chosen who went to

00:58:26.116 --> 00:58:28.585
which school.
I guess it was done by social

00:58:28.585 --> 00:58:30.280
security number,
I don't know.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.445
In Harvard and in Yale too,
there's some randomization

00:58:34.445 --> 00:58:37.590
about which college house you
live in.

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:40.003
That's one way to achieve
randomization:

00:58:40.003 --> 00:58:42.170
you could have it done
centrally.

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:44.495
The central administration,
this local government,

00:58:44.495 --> 00:58:47.010
the central government,
can randomly assign people.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:49.964
But in principle,
there's another way to achieve

00:58:49.964 --> 00:58:54.275
randomization.
What's the other way you could

00:58:54.275 --> 00:58:58.231
achieve randomization?
Both in this experiment and

00:58:58.231 --> 00:59:00.511
elsewhere.
There was a hand way in the

00:59:00.511 --> 00:59:06.900
back;
can we get it?

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.090
Student: Each player in
the game could randomly choose.

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:12.237
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so rather than having

00:59:12.237 --> 00:59:14.975
centralized randomization,
in principle,

00:59:14.975 --> 00:59:19.605
you could get to the same
outcome by having individual

00:59:19.605 --> 00:59:25.353
randomization.
So there's another possibility

00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:31.179
here, which is individual
randomization.

00:59:31.179 --> 00:59:34.027
In principle,
you could have everybody in the

00:59:34.027 --> 00:59:37.909
room decide that what they're
going to do is throw a coin,

00:59:37.909 --> 00:59:39.961
a fair coin,
each of them separately,

00:59:39.961 --> 00:59:43.038
and if it comes up heads
they'll go to East Town and if

00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:45.659
it comes up tails they'll go to
West Town,

00:59:45.659 --> 00:59:48.987
and if all of them do that and
they all stick with it,

00:59:48.987 --> 00:59:52.503
again, by the law of large
numbers we'll get pretty close

00:59:52.503 --> 00:59:55.217
to integrated towns.
But it won't have been some

00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:57.139
central authority doing the
randomization.

00:59:57.139 --> 00:59:59.717
it'll be each of you
individually doing the

00:59:59.717 --> 01:00:03.090
randomization.
Is that right?

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.042
So that's a little bit
different, and notice that if

01:00:06.042 --> 01:00:09.116
everyone else is doing this,
if everyone else is

01:00:09.116 --> 01:00:12.423
randomizing, the towns will in
fact be, at least

01:00:12.423 --> 01:00:15.483
asymptotically,
the towns will be equally mixed

01:00:15.483 --> 01:00:17.450
and you'll be happy to
randomize.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.000
Why?
Because you'll be indifferent

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.822
whether you end up in East Town
or West Town,

01:00:20.822 --> 01:00:22.519
so you may as well toss a coin
anyway.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:26.559
So this is actually another
Nash Equilibirum.

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:29.427
I'm being a bit loose here but
we'll be much more precise in a

01:00:29.427 --> 01:00:30.719
moment.
There's another Nash

01:00:30.719 --> 01:00:33.239
Equilibrium, yet another Nash
Equilibrium, in this model,

01:00:33.239 --> 01:00:36.405
and it isn't as silly in some
sense as having everyone going

01:00:36.405 --> 01:00:39.409
to East Town and then having the
government randomize.

01:00:39.409 --> 01:00:43.922
It's each person on their own
tossing a coin and deciding

01:00:43.922 --> 01:00:47.487
where to go.
It sounds a little bit less

01:00:47.487 --> 01:00:51.460
like central planning and more
like choice.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.275
Now, however,
as soon as we introduced the

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:58.533
idea of individual randomization
we've gone a little bit beyond

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:01.949
where we got to in the class.
Why?

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:06.373
Because so far in the class,
we've talked about strategies

01:01:06.373 --> 01:01:09.710
as the choices that are
available to you.

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.628
The choices available to you
were go to the East Town,

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:15.175
go to the West Town.
Or, in the numbers game we

01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:17.556
played, it was choose a number.
Or, in the ά

01:01:17.556 --> 01:01:19.376
β game we played,
it was choose ά

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.446
or β.
Or deciding whether to invest

01:01:21.446 --> 01:01:24.719
or not, it was invest or don't
invest, and so on and so forth.

01:01:24.719 --> 01:01:28.690
What we're seeing now is a new
type of strategy.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:34.154
And the new type of strategy is
to randomize over your existing

01:01:34.154 --> 01:01:36.701
strategies.
So we're introducing here a new

01:01:36.701 --> 01:01:39.369
notion that's going to occupy us
for the rest of the week,

01:01:39.369 --> 01:01:48.637
and the new notion is a
randomized, or as we're going to

01:01:48.637 --> 01:01:56.036
call them, "mixed strategies."
So what is--I'll be more formal

01:01:56.036 --> 01:01:58.690
next time, but what is a mixed
strategy?

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:04.949
It is a randomization over your
pure strategies.

01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:07.913
The strategies that we've dealt
with in the course up to now,

01:02:07.913 --> 01:02:09.938
from now on,
we're going to refer to those

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:12.210
as pure strategies,
they are your choices.

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:17.028
And we're going to expand your
actual available choices to

01:02:17.028 --> 01:02:20.409
include all randomizations over
those.

01:02:20.409 --> 01:02:29.907
This may seem a little weird,
so to make it seem a little bit

01:02:29.907 --> 01:02:37.980
less weird, let's move
immediately to an example.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:44.151
So, the example I want to talk
about is a game that I think is

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:50.120
familiar to a number of you,
but I'll put up the payoffs and

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.139
see.
So the payoffs look like this;

01:02:52.139 --> 01:02:58.317
each person has--there's two
players--each of them has three

01:02:58.317 --> 01:03:03.448
strategies and the payoff matrix
looks as follows:

01:03:03.448 --> 01:03:09.836
(0,0) is down the lead diagonal
and going around it's going to

01:03:09.836 --> 01:03:13.291
be (1,-1), (-1,1),
(-1,1), (1,-1),

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:18.513
(1,-1), (-1,1).
Now, without me putting anymore

01:03:18.513 --> 01:03:21.780
letters up there what is this
game?

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.380
Right, so somebody shouted it
out, this is "rock,

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.429
paper, scissors."
So I think, if I get this

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:31.791
right, this better be rock,
and this better be scissors

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:34.780
actually and this better be
paper.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.528
This is rock, paper, scissors.
How many of you have not heard

01:03:37.528 --> 01:03:39.070
of rock, paper,
scissors?

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:42.026
Good;
the other day I was flicking

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:45.725
channels and ESPN had a rock,
paper, scissors contest and I

01:03:45.725 --> 01:03:48.150
just want to know who watches
that?

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:51.889
So this is quite a fun game and
it occurs all over the place.

01:03:51.889 --> 01:03:55.099
It occurs even in episodes of
the Simpsons.

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:58.189
So there's I guess by now
famous episode of the Simpsons

01:03:58.189 --> 01:04:00.829
in which the kids who are I
guess Bart and Lisa,

01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:02.672
is that right?
Somebody help me out here,

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.050
Bart and Lisa is that what
they're called?

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:07.530
So Bart and Lisa are playing
rock, paper, scissors for some

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.401
purpose, to allocate some prize.
And Bart is seen to think (as

01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:14.369
you can do it in cartoons) seed
to think, "Rock,

01:04:14.369 --> 01:04:16.643
paper, scissors,
I love playing rock,

01:04:16.643 --> 01:04:18.320
paper, scissors.
Rock rocks.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.199
What could possibly beat rock?"
Lisa is seen to think,

01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:24.360
"I love playing rock,
paper, scissors;

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:29.661
Bart always chooses rock."
That's really a hint of where

01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:31.461
we're going here.
That's a hint of where we're

01:04:31.461 --> 01:04:33.202
going.
This is a very simple game

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.470
"rock, paper,
scissors," but it's pretty

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:38.597
obvious,
I hope, that pure strategies in

01:04:38.597 --> 01:04:42.850
this game are probably not
enough to model this guy.

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.686
Is that right?
So, in particular,

01:04:44.686 --> 01:04:48.751
I claim and if necessary will
prove that there is no Nash

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:52.411
Equilibrium in pure strategies,
in the strategies that we've

01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:55.726
been looking at up to now.
There's no Nash Equilibrium in

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:58.760
which people choose pure
strategies here.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.070
So there's no Nash Equilibrium.
From now on I'm going to use

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.899
the term pure strategies to mean
the strategies we've been

01:05:06.899 --> 01:05:11.651
looking at so far.
So by pure strategies here,

01:05:11.651 --> 01:05:17.963
the set of pure strategies is
equal to the set rock,

01:05:17.963 --> 01:05:22.360
paper, and scissors;
so what we've called strategies

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.107
up to now in the class.
So now, can everyone see why

01:05:25.107 --> 01:05:28.590
there's not going to be a Nash
Equilibrium in pure strategies?

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:33.042
Let's just talk it through.
So, if one person plays rock,

01:05:33.042 --> 01:05:36.630
the best response against rock
is?

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.150
Let's try that again;
you all know.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:41.289
Best response to rock is?
Paper;

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:43.860
but if you played paper the
best response to paper is?

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.516
Scissors;
and the best response to

01:05:45.516 --> 01:05:47.380
scissors is?
Rock;

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.409
so everyone knows how to play
this game.

01:05:48.409 --> 01:05:50.419
So clearly, there's not going
to be a pure strategies Nash

01:05:50.419 --> 01:05:52.692
Equilibrium, right?
Because any attempt to look for

01:05:52.692 --> 01:05:55.657
best responses that are best
responses to each other can lead

01:05:55.657 --> 01:05:57.639
to a cycle.
Everyone see that?

01:05:57.639 --> 01:06:00.672
There's no hope of finding two
pure strategies that are best

01:06:00.672 --> 01:06:03.139
responses to each other because
of that cycle.

01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:06.322
It's also, I claim,
pretty easy to figure out what

01:06:06.322 --> 01:06:09.179
must be the Nash Equilibrium in
this game.

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:11.293
We're going to prove it in a
second, more or less,

01:06:11.293 --> 01:06:13.320
but nevertheless I think we
actually know it.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.757
So what is, in fact,
the Nash Equilibrium strategy

01:06:16.757 --> 01:06:18.796
in this game?
Let's get some--you could

01:06:18.796 --> 01:06:23.067
probably cold call somebody;
just cold call somebody at

01:06:23.067 --> 01:06:24.983
random.
I'm sure they all know it,

01:06:24.983 --> 01:06:27.882
so just cold call somebody.
So what's the--yeah the

01:06:27.882 --> 01:06:33.010
gentleman in yellow--what's the
Nash Equilibrium in this game?

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:34.329
I'm allowing you mixed
strategies now;

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:36.508
I'm allowing you to
randomize--if I allow you to

01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:38.269
randomize over your pure
strategies,

01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:42.284
I'm allowing you to play mixed
strategies, what's the mixed

01:06:42.284 --> 01:06:45.400
strategy we think people are
going to play?

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.708
Student: No idea.
Professor Ben Polak: No

01:06:46.708 --> 01:06:47.902
idea;
you should be on that--I want

01:06:47.902 --> 01:06:51.753
to play against you.
Let's have someone else picked

01:06:51.753 --> 01:06:54.470
out, yeah.
What do we think is likely to

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:57.817
be the mixed strategy people are
going to play in this game in

01:06:57.817 --> 01:06:59.329
equilibrium?
Student: No idea.

01:06:59.329 --> 01:07:00.719
Professor Ben Polak: No
idea?

01:07:00.719 --> 01:07:03.081
Who here is regarded as a
champion of "rock,

01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:05.421
paper, scissors" player?
Student: Playing each

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.559
choice with one-third
probability.

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:07.570
Professor Ben Polak:
Thank you.

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:10.098
I thought that would be okay.
So I'm--people didn't play this

01:07:10.098 --> 01:07:12.871
with their siblings?
Maybe they did and they just

01:07:12.871 --> 01:07:17.117
lost a lot.
So I claim as a guess that the

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:22.579
Nash Equilibrium is each player,
both players,

01:07:22.579 --> 01:07:29.828
each player chooses--and I'm
going to call it 1/3,1/3,1/3--in

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:32.746
other words,
each player is playing the

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:35.622
mixed strategy 1/3,1/3,1/3 which
I'm sorry I didn't catch your

01:07:35.622 --> 01:07:37.120
name,
your name is?

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.948
Student: Moses.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:07:38.948 --> 01:07:40.550
Which is Moses' recommended
strategy.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:44.119
So each player is going to play
1/3,1/3,1/3.

01:07:44.119 --> 01:07:46.898
So I'm actually amazed that
people didn't realize that and

01:07:46.898 --> 01:07:49.823
again I'm sort of puzzled as
what happened in your childhood,

01:07:49.823 --> 01:07:52.780
but never mind.
Let's figure out what in fact

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.769
is the payoff to each of the
pure strategies against it.

01:07:56.769 --> 01:08:00.500
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you that this will

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.809
in fact be a Nash Equilibrium by
showing you payoffs.

01:08:03.809 --> 01:08:09.593
So what's the expected
payoff--to start off,

01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:17.260
what's the expected payoff of
rock against 1/3,1/3,1/3?

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.143
So the other person's
randomizing equally over rock,

01:08:20.143 --> 01:08:22.800
paper, scissors and I'm going
to choose rock.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.520
What will be my payoff,
my expected payoff?

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.946
Well, I claim that with
probability 1/3 I'll meet

01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:36.598
another rock and get 0,
and with probability of 1/3

01:08:36.598 --> 01:08:43.720
I'll meet a scissors and get -1
and with probability of 1/3 I'll

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.750
meet paper--I said that wrong,
let me start again.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.377
The probability 1/3 I'll meet
rock and get 0,

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.064
probability 1/3 I'll meet
scissors and get +1,

01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:57.230
and a probability 1/3 I'll meet
paper and get -1.

01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:03.399
Is that right this time?
So my expected payoff is what?

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:11.600
It's 1/3 of 0,1/3 of +1,
and 1/3 of -1 for a total of 0.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.061
It's not hard to check that the
same is true if I chose

01:09:16.061 --> 01:09:19.162
scissors.
If I chose scissors and the

01:09:19.162 --> 01:09:23.060
other person is randomizing
1/3,1/3,1/3 then with

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.454
probability 1/3 I will get -1,
with probability 1/3 I will

01:09:27.454 --> 01:09:31.326
meet another scissors and get 0,
and with probability 1/3 I'll

01:09:31.326 --> 01:09:36.590
meet paper and get 1,
and once again it nets out at 0.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:40.990
Finally, if I played paper,
and once again I'm going to

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:45.716
meet somebody who is in fact
randomizing a 1/3,1/3,1/3 over

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:50.768
rock, paper, and scissors then
with probability 1/3 I'll meet a

01:09:50.768 --> 01:09:55.008
rock and get 1,
with probability 1/3 I'll meet

01:09:55.008 --> 01:09:59.137
scissors and get -1,
and with probability 1/3 I'll

01:09:59.137 --> 01:10:02.320
meet paper and get 0.
Is that correct?

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.090
Everyone happy with that?
So it will net out at 0.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:09.262
So each of the pure strategies
here rock, paper,

01:10:09.262 --> 01:10:12.923
or scissors–actually,
I did rock, scissors,

01:10:12.923 --> 01:10:17.547
and paper, each of them when
they play against 1/3,1/3,1/3

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.630
they yield an expected payoff of
0.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.149
What about playing the mix
itself?

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:32.797
What's the expected payoff of
playing--myself playing

01:10:32.797 --> 01:10:41.279
1/3,1/3,1/3 if I play against
somebody who's playing

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:46.281
1/3,1/3,1/3?
Well, a 1/3 of the time I'm

01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:51.051
going to be playing rock,
so a 1/3 of the time I'm going

01:10:51.051 --> 01:10:56.254
to be playing rock and then I'll
get the expected payoff from

01:10:56.254 --> 01:10:59.550
playing rock against
1/3,1/3,1/3.

01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:02.698
What was the expected payoff
from playing rock against

01:11:02.698 --> 01:11:05.029
1/3,1/3,1/3?
Zero.

01:11:05.029 --> 01:11:13.395
So, 1/3 of the time I'm going
to play rock and I'm going to

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:17.004
get this 0.
And 1/3 of the time I'm going

01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:20.113
to be playing scissors,
and then I'm going to get the

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:23.761
expected payoff from scissors
against 1/3,1/3,1/3 and what was

01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:27.170
the expected payoff of scissors
against 1/3,1/3,1/3?

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:32.016
Zero again.
So 1/3 of the time I'll play

01:11:32.016 --> 01:11:37.891
scissors and I'll get this 0.
And 1/3 of the time I'll be

01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:41.316
playing paper,
in which case I'll get the

01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:46.710
expected payoff of paper against
1/3,1/3,1/3 which once again is

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:50.781
0.
So my total expected payoff is

01:11:50.781 --> 01:11:55.872
1/3 of 0, plus 1/3 of 0,
plus 1/3 of 0 which,

01:11:55.872 --> 01:12:01.890
for the math phobics in the
room comes, out as 0.

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:06.065
So notice what we've shown here;
we've shown that if I play what

01:12:06.065 --> 01:12:10.969
I claim is the equilibrium
strategy 1/3,1/3,1/3 against

01:12:10.969 --> 01:12:16.146
1/3,1/3,1/3 I get 0 and if I
played any other strategy I'd

01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:18.630
still get 0,
is that right?

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.953
So therefore playing
1/3,1/3,1/3 is indeed a best

01:12:21.953 --> 01:12:25.553
response, albeit weakly,
it is indeed a best response

01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:28.529
and this is in fact a Nash
Equilibrium.

01:12:28.529 --> 01:12:37.144
So what we've shown here is in
"rock, paper,

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:48.763
scissors" playing 1/3,1/3,1/3
against the other guy playing

01:12:48.763 --> 01:12:59.781
1/3,1/3,1/3 is a best response,
anything would be a best

01:12:59.781 --> 01:13:10.800
response, but in particular it's
a best response.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:17.682
So if both people play this,
one person plays a 1/3,1/3,1/3

01:13:17.682 --> 01:13:23.971
and the other person plays
1/3,1/3,1/3, this is a Nash

01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:27.286
Equilibrium.
So we're belaboring a point

01:13:27.286 --> 01:13:30.224
that we all knew already:
playing 1/3,1/3,1/3 against--if

01:13:30.224 --> 01:13:33.319
everyone plays a 1/3,1/3,1/3
that is a Nash Equilibrium.

01:13:33.319 --> 01:13:35.571
It's a little harder to show
but it's true,

01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:38.090
that that's the only
equilibrium in the game.

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.753
Before you go,
if any of you know the people

01:13:40.753 --> 01:13:43.478
that run ESPN,
this is why watching this game

01:13:43.478 --> 01:13:45.770
on TV is unlikely to be
exciting.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:48.466
We'll come back and look at
other mixed strategies and more

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:50.599
interesting games on Wednesday.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.920
- So, today we're gonna talk
about money in politics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.140
- [Obama] Last week the Supreme Court

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.350
reversed a century of law

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.650
that I believe will open the floodgates

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.200
for special interests,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.470
including foreign corporations,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.895
to spend without limit in our elections.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.390
(audience applauds)

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.093
Including foreign corporations,
to spend without limits.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.840
I don't think American
elections should be bankrolled

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.160
by America's most powerful interests.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.803
Or worse, by foreign entities.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.440
They should be decided
by the American people.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.520
And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.520
to pass a bill that helps
correct some of these problems.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.260
- So that was Barack Obama's
2010 "State of the Union"

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.853
in late January of 2010,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.790
a couple of weeks after the Supreme Court

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.090
had handed down its
Citizens United decision.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.360
And the clip went viral
because of that playback

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.820
of Associate Justice Samuel Alito

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.370
who lip readers were debating

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.300
whether he was saying,
"You lie," or, "Not true,"

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.877
in the middle of Obama's speech.

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:31.240
It was an unusual speech because normally

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.620
presidents do not criticize the Court

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.310
during something like a
"State of the Union" speech

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.510
and nor do members of the Court

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.340
respond to what the president says.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.930
And so it became a sort of emblematic

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.930
of the tussles between
the Obama administration

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.980
and the much more conservative judiciary.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.390
Many people thought and think

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.480
that Citizens United
was a horrific decision

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.260
that, as Obama said, opened the floodgates

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.310
to corporate money in politics,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.310
making even more problematic
the sort of things

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.520
identified in the book about dark money

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.640
which I've put on the syllabus for today.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.360
I'm gonna give you a
somewhat different argument.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.930
I think that Citizens United is a symptom

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.550
of a much different and
a much bigger problem,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.350
and so that reversing Citizens United

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.970
would really be sort of taking a bandaid

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.960
to a much bigger problem.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.150
So our agenda is we're gonna start off

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.930
by noticing that there's a difference

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.767
between the supply of money in politics

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.490
and the demand for money.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.490
Almost everything you read
about money in politics

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.730
is about the supply.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.560
It's about the lobbyists,
it's about the fat cats,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.130
it's about the people who spend money

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.200
in order to work their way in politics,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.050
and that's why they're supplying it.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.860
Almost nobody talks about the demand side.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.860
Why is there so much desire
for money in American politics?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.270
Much more in American politics
than in many other systems.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.160
And so in the last part of the lecture

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.050
I'm gonna come to the demand side.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.390
For most of the lecture I'm
gonna focus on the supply side,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.560
as almost everybody does,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.150
but we should remember

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.423
that it's only one piece of the equation.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.500
I'm gonna begin by talking
before I get into the guts

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.820
of the money in politics subject

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.550
I'm gonna talk more generally

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.390
about courts in American politics

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.370
and separate out some
myths from realities.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.300
Many people think that they
idea of an independent judiciary

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.300
with powers to review the
constitutionality of legislation

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.380
that comes out of the political
branches is a great thing.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.750
If you look at the third and fourth waves

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.810
of democracy around the world,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.633
which I'm gonna be
talking about on Thursday,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.630
the idea of a separation of
powers is a big American export.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.490
It's often the feature
of the US Constitution

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.370
that is most often copied in
constitutions around the world.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.720
So I'm gonna start out
by spending some time

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.220
on myths and realities
about the role of courts

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.720
in American politics and more generally.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.930
Then we'll go into the
history of the First Amendment

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.570
since the 1970s sixth
decision, Buckley v. Valeo,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.240
where the modern world of money and speech

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.773
really gets started.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.750
I'll pay some attention to
the changing media context

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.440
that all of this is going
on in as we've evolved

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.870
from the world I was
describing in the last lecture,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.960
the world in which everybody watched

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.350
the same evening news at 6:30

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.350
to the world of Twitter and blogging

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.830
and people getting most of their news

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.343
from places like Facebook.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.807
And then we will conclude by
attending to the demand side,

00:05:31.807 --> 00:05:33.980
the much-neglected demand side,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.810
which will become an important
feature of my argument

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.650
later in the course.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.440
So let's talk about courts
in American politics,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.717
as my subtitle here is
"Myths and Realities."

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.820
This is a picture of the Warren Court.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.350
And I put the Warren Court up there

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.510
for a very particular reason,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.870
which is that the Warren Court

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.710
was a massive outlier in American history.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.620
It was a massive outlier

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.900
because it was an extremely progressive,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.460
to use the term that liberalism
has been reinvented as

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.400
in the last decade or so.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.500
Possibly the most progressive
Court in American history.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.310
And it was remarkable, first and foremost,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.860
because Earl Warren, who was appointed by

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.460
President Eisenhower in 1953,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.293
Eisenhower called it

00:06:35.293 --> 00:06:38.317
"the worst damned-fool
mistake I ever made."

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.090
He had been a conservative governor,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.920
a Republican governor of California.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.870
He had been responsible for the internment

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.463
of Japanese prisoners during World War II.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.370
He didn't have any signs

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.900
that he was gonna be a
much different person

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.760
than he turned out to be on the Court,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.760
and so he presided over this
era known as the Warren Court.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.253
And as you can see, actually,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.470
interesting, if you go down to
the bottom of the slide there

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.540
you can see another one that Eisenhower

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.810
pretty much got wrong.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.733
The Eisenhower appointees
are in blue there.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.210
William Brennan also turned out
to be a very liberal justice

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:31.690
and didn't make Eisenhower very happy.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.690
But you can see that there
were four holdovers in beige

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.400
appointed by FDR,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.240
and so it turned out to be the case

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.800
that for much of this period

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.090
the Court was extremely liberal.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.970
And it's also the case,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.390
and maybe not so surprising
when I make this point,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.550
that if you look at the academics

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.370
who are champions of judicial review,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.500
the Laurence Tribe's,
the Ronald Dworkin's,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.690
the Owen Fiss's of this world,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.610
they are people who came of
age during the Warren Court.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.710
And many people thought

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.250
that this was a sort
of secular development

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.410
that the Court, which had struck down,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.513
this Warren Court which had
struck down a lot of racist,

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.190
racist legislation and
legislation that had been harmful

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.630
to poor people, was sort of a new normal,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.170
a wave of the future, if you'd like.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.473
And after Warren was
replaced by Warren Burger

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.610
and we started to get more
conservative drifts of the Court,

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.640
you could often read, for instance,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.180
in "The New York Review of Books,"

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.150
you could read articles
by people like Dworkin

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.720
attacking what was happening to the Court

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.380
as though they were
undoing the new normal,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.070
and that this is a terrible thing

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.050
and we just needed to get over this

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.810
and things would snap back.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
So there was in what retrospect
is quite a lot of denial

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.503
about what was actually happening.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.890
But just to give a sense

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.860
of how liberal the Warren Court was,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.390
this is the Court that was responsible

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.920
for the decisions in Brown
v. Board of Education,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.830
1954 and then the follow-up
decision the following year

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.420
that said separate but equal cannot stand.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.220
This is the Court that
in Baker v. Carr in 1962

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.760
and a subsequent case two years later

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.010
said the Court can get involved
in redistricting cases,

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.240
that this is not a political question

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.490
that they have to keep out of.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.730
And then they ruled that districts

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.860
have to be more or less equal
in size, population size,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.860
which was a way of limiting
the disenfranchisement

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.990
of urban voters.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.620
This is the Court which in Mapp v. Ohio

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.040
said that unreasonable
searches and seizures

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.570
would produce evidence
that wouldn't be able

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.380
to be used in court.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.380
This is the Court that in
1963, Gideon v. Wainwright,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.240
said that indigent defendants

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.730
would have a right to an attorney

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.290
appointed by the government

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.360
if they couldn't pay for one themselves.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.250
This is the Court that in
New York Times v. Sullivan

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.820
said that

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.300
if a public figure wants
to accuse you of defamation

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.270
there's a very high standard.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.420
They have to find actual
malice on your part.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.070
It's an extremely difficult thing to prove

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.720
so it was seen as a huge boon
for the freedom of the press

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.760
to act as the fourth branch
of government, if you'd like,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.690
in criticizing public officials.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.417
This is the Court that in 1965

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.259
adopted Griswold v. Connecticut,

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:18.580
a decision that said that outlawing

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.700
contraception in the State
of Connecticut was illegal

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.520
and would become very important later

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.463
because it became the
building blog for Roe v. Wade,

00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:33.730
that was actually at the
beginning of the Burger Court.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.270
But the logic came from
Griswold v. Connecticut,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.530
which was the idea there
was a concept of privacy

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.190
that the Court affirmed in Griswold

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.140
that would become the basis
of the decision in Roe v. Wade

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.360
in the following decade.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.020
This is the Court that
adopted Miranda v. Arizona.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.540
You've all heard about Miranda warnings.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.220
You have a right to remain silent.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.220
You have a right to have an attorney.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.170
And if the police violate
those Miranda warnings,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.560
convictions will not stand.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.000
This is the Court that
adopted Loving v. Virginia,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.130
which outlawed anti-miscegenation laws,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.090
laws against interracial marriage,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.510
many that had then
prevailed in many states.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.500
So this is by no means an exhaustive list.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.750
Just to give you a flavor of the Court.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.520
It was really seen as the vanguard

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.011
of progressive change by many liberals

00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:42.450
and led, as I said, to that generation

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.100
of legal and constitutional
theorists to think that courts

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.100
were tremendously important
engines of social change.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.760
But it was an outlier.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.230
Typically, presidents don't make

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.614
the kind of damned-fool mistake

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:04.700
that Eisenhower accused
himself of having made

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.860
with the appointment of Earl Warren.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.510
Typically, presidents get pretty much

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.430
the courts that they want.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.430
And typically, judges are
fairly conservative figures

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.060
that don't wanna rock the boat,

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.970
that tend to affirm the status quo.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.740
And so the Court that
we've actually had since

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.063
the Warren Court, first the Burger Court,

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:31.960
then the Rehnquist Court,
and then the Roberts Court,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.430
those courts are much more typical

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:39.310
of how courts have behaved
throughout American history.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.540
So if we go back and just,
again, just to give you a flavor

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.270
of how courts have tended to behave

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.450
through most of American
history, not the Warren era,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.187
Dred Scott v. Stanford
was the case in which

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.540
the Court held that
blacks were not citizens

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.183
within the meaning of the Constitution,

00:14:03.183 --> 00:14:07.010
they're not being contemplated
to include them as citizens

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.440
and so a fugitive slave
did not have standing

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.900
to go to court to get protection.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.900
This is the Slaughter-House Cases in 1873.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.190
This was in the aftermath.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.373
This is the years when the Reconstruction

00:14:26.507 --> 00:14:28.610
was beginning to fail

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.700
and the Court did its bit to make sure

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.283
that it would be reigned in.

00:14:33.283 --> 00:14:37.070
The Slaughter-House Cases
limited the application

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.470
of the Fourteenth Amendment's

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.930
Privileges and Immunities
Clause to the federal government

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.787
and refused to apply it to the states.

00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:50.787
The case of United States v. Reese in 1876

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.720
said that the Fifteenth Amendment,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.630
which said that the
franchised could no be denied

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.630
on the basis of race, only
denied it on the basis of race.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.890
It didn't deny it on the basis

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.290
of what came to be used
for proxies of race,

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.780
like poll, taxes, or
literacy requirements,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.250
or the other instruments
that were there wheeled out

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.730
across the American South
to disenfranchise blacks.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.790
The same year, they
adopted US v. Cruikshank,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.890
which said that the Bill of Rights

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.760
does not apply to private
actors or state governments.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.700
Again, limiting the Civil War amendments

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.280
in their range and force.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.230
The Civil Rights Cases
the following decade

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.890
said that the Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Amendments

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.410
didn't apply to private individuals.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:50.410
Lochner v. New York in the
early part of this century

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.380
became emblematic of the
Court that would strike down

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.440
much new deal legislation
in subsequent decades,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.250
eventually leading to FDR's
attempt to pack the Court,

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.120
which blew up in his face

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.120
as they were striking down
so much new deal legislation.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.780
But in fact the Court, even though FDR,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.710
which he had threatened to
appoint five new justices

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.520
and produced a lot of opposition,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.940
but after that the Court
did back down somewhat.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.750
This is the Court that, this Court in 1944

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.470
adopted Korematsu v. the United States

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.970
which allowed for the internship

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:40.970
of Japanese-Americans during the war.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.890
2013, Shelby County v. Holder.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.640
This was a decision that cut back

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.450
on really important parts
of the Voting Rights Act

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.080
which had required states with a history

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.990
of suppressing votes
or making it difficult

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.300
for African-Americans to get to vote

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.500
to have pre-clearance from
the Justice Department

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.200
that there was no longer a problem.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200
And as I think it was Justice
Ginsburg said in her dissent,

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.830
it was a bit like saying,
"We no longer need,

00:17:21.517 --> 00:17:23.337
"we can throw away our umbrella

00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:25.257
"even though the reason we're dry

00:17:25.257 --> 00:17:27.610
"is that we're holding it up."

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.250
So big, big reductions
on the Voting Rights Act.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.200
And then of course the Court

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.430
that the topics we're
gonna be talking about

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.840
in more depth today, the
courts about money and speech,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.520
from Buckley to Citizens
United and subsequently.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.550
So again, this is just a flavor as well,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.550
but the big point there is
that these kinds of decisions

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.190
are much more typical of
how constitutional courts

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.260
have behaved across the
range of American history.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.100
And so we need to come to terms with that,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.030
that the Warren Court
was a remarkable outlier

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.780
and it should give us pause in thinking

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.200
about how important it
is to empower courts

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.023
to behave in the ways that
they typically have done.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.770
There's a lot of
scholarship on this subject.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.670
I wanna just alert you to some of it.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.700
Perhaps the most famous article

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.700
is one piece by Robert
Dahl published in 1957.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.850
He was a longtime professor at Yale

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.820
and this is a landmark paper

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.260
in which he shows quantitatively

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.020
that if you look at the data

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.370
there's no evidence that
Supreme Court decisions

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.370
or judiciary review has
actually contributed

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.840
anything more to the protection
of minorities' rights

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.080
or vulnerable people's rights

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.030
than not having the Court there.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.650
This is a book by a professor now

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.450
at the University of Toronto, Ran Hirschl,

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.080
it was a dissertation in this department,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.950
where he looks at countries that have gone

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.430
from not having judiciary
review to having it,

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.307
countries like New Zealand,
Israel, and elsewhere,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.020
and shows you can't see
any significant difference

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.450
in the protection of individual rights

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.200
when they go from not having to having it.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.953
Mark Tushnet, a legal scholar
now I believe at Harvard,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.710
has written an important
book arguing about why

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.500
giving more and more control
over the Constitution

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.060
is not a good idea from the point of view

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.360
of protecting the sorts of rights

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.850
we want protected in a democracy.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.950
His Australian counterpart,
another legal scholar,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.810
Jeremy Waldron, his famous article here

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.040
in the "Yale Law Journal"
is part of an ongoing debate

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.970
between him and Ronald Dworkin.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.063
Dworkin was advocating a
Bill of Rights for Britain,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.990
and Waldron was saying
don't export this aspect

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.823
of the American system.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.780
And finally, another important book

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.450
that started out as a
PhD dissertation at Yale

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.980
by Gerald Rosenberg, a
professor at Chicago,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.400
about Brown v. Board of Education
and subsequent decisions

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.920
which says that if you
look at the real progress

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.180
that has actually been made
in school disaggregation,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.480
where it's been made,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.510
has come from legislatures and not courts.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:58.050
So all of this is just a salutary reminder

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.410
that we should think
about the reality that

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.250
is not only in American history

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.010
but if you look comparatively

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.440
the most important variable
from the standpoint

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.440
of protecting individual rights
and vulnerable minorities

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.090
is getting democracy, about
which I'll have more to say

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.460
in coming lectures,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.500
and adding judiciary review on top of that

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.910
doesn't do very much, if anything at all.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.190
And indeed, sometimes it's inimical

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.830
to the functioning of democracy

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.830
and the decisions that are made
by democratic legislatures.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.810
So, all of that is byway
of throat clearing preamble

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.740
to our subject for today.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.060
And this exhibit A, if you'd like.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.280
This is the main message of this lecture.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.280
It's exhibit A in observing
that relying on courts

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.450
as ways of protecting
democratic institutions

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.860
might not be such a great idea.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.833
So.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.450
Where we have to start,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.180
because we have a written Constitution

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.820
and a constitutional system,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.440
is with the First Amendment,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.980
and particularly the Speech
Clause of the First Amendment

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.947
which says that "Congress
shall make no law

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:32.187
"abridging freedom of
speech, or of the press;

00:22:32.187 --> 00:22:34.747
"or the right of people
peaceable to assemble,

00:22:34.747 --> 00:22:36.617
"and to petition the government

00:22:36.617 --> 00:22:39.860
"for a redress of grievances."

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.140
This is the text which
we're all working from.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.140
And what I'm going to do
now is take you through

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.300
basically the 40-year history
since Buckley v. Valeo

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.830
of how the Court has interpreted

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.830
the Speech Clause of the First Amendment

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.150
as it pertains to money in politics.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.990
So the background to this is in 1974,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.420
when Congress had enacted
very radical changes

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.990
to the Federal Election Campaign of 1971.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.960
They did this over Gerald Ford's veto

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.800
and it was the first comprehensive effort

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.970
by the federal government to regulate

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.550
campaign contributions and spending.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.790
Money was starting to become

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.830
a really important issue
in American politics

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.350
and they felt the need
to do something about it.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.310
I would just note and
pick up this point later,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:43.540
this is the period at which
American political parties

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.720
were starting to become weaker.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.760
And I think there's an
important connection

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.200
between weak parties

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.830
and the need on the part
of politicians for money

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.863
that I'm going to spend
more time on later.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.080
So the key provisions of
the 1974 legislation were

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.430
to limit contributions to
candidates for federal office,

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.870
limit how much can be given to campaigns.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.940
It required the disclosure
of political contributions,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.470
no secret contributions.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.980
It limited expenditures by candidates

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.880
and associated committees,
what we today would call PACs.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.947
And it limits independent
expenditures to $1,000.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.640
And then finally it put limits

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.630
on what candidates could spend

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.240
from their own personal funds
in order to get elected.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.820
So the goal was really to
rein in the use of money.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.850
And you'll see two terms there

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.258
that the distinction between
which becomes important.

00:24:49.258 --> 00:24:53.690
The two terms: contributions
and expenditures.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.110
And they make a distinction

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.500
between contributions and expenditures

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.610
which drives a lot of
what they were doing.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.370
They also provided for public financing

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.493
of presidential elections.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.707
Two years later, we got Buckley v. Valeo.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.940
And Buckley struck down
most of that legislation

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.300
as unconstitutional violation
of the Speech Clause

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.010
of the First Amendment.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.320
It held the following.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.930
It said it's all right for Congress

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.950
to limit contributions to campaigns,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.810
and the argument there was

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.000
because there's a risk of corruption.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.610
If you have people making contributions,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.900
they can get a quid pro
quo, and that's not cool.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.600
But it's not okay to limit expenditures.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.260
Here the First Amendment rules.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.340
So the idea of an expenditure

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.990
is if I wanna go out and spend money

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.050
saying I think that Cristina
should be president,

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.010
I'm just spending money,
I'm not giving her money.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.050
I'm expressing my First Amendment views.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:06.050
And that is not legitimate for Congress

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.840
to limit expenditures.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.840
It's also not legitimate to stop Cristina

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.170
from using her personal
funds to get elected

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.490
because there's no risk of
corruption there either.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.700
We saw Donald Trump making this argument

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.737
in the 2016 campaign, saying,

00:26:26.737 --> 00:26:30.650
"I don't need money
from special interests."

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:35.650
So there's no risk of a quid
pro quo, so the argument went.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.430
And most important they said

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.620
the idea of leveling the
playing field in elections,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.640
it might be a desirable
thing for governments to do

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.640
but it's not that important
that it should rise to the level

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.750
of interfering with the First Amendment.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.570
Because the First Amendment protects

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.630
what the Court in its
interpretative dicta calls

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.440
a fundamental right.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.440
And a fundamental right stands

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.710
unless there's a compelling
government interest,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.870
that they subject possible violations

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.600
of fundamental rights to the highest

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.670
or the most stringent
levels of judicial scrutiny.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.820
And they said it'd be nice
to level the playing field

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.090
but there's no constitutional requirement

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.380
of a leveled playing field in elections.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.600
There's a constitutional
protection of free speech.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.837
And so the opinion said
that the First Amendment

00:27:37.837 --> 00:27:41.200
"simply cannot tolerate" any interference

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.897
with a candidate's freedom "to speak

00:27:42.897 --> 00:27:46.920
"without legislative limit on
behalf of his own candidacy."

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.973
This was the phrase about
self-funded elections.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.040
And then more generally,
this is a nice metaphor.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.470
This is actually in a
footnote to the decision

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.397
where the Court says,
"Being free to engage

00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:05.777
"in unlimited political expression

00:28:05.777 --> 00:28:08.477
"subject to a ceiling on expenditures

00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:11.277
"is like being free to drive an automobile

00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:14.047
"as far and as often as one desires

00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:16.707
"on a single tank of gasoline."

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.860
Who is the government to tell me

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.030
how much gasoline I can put in my car?

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.080
They might wanna level some playing field

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.560
but this is about a constitutional right

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.550
protected by the First Amendment.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.713
So, that was the decision.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.060
There's some important
assumptions I want to just flag.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.113
One is that money is speech.

00:28:46.643 --> 00:28:49.097
In a dissent, Byron White said,

00:28:49.097 --> 00:28:51.217
"Money isn't speech, money is money."

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.797
And he might have also said,

00:28:55.797 --> 00:29:00.117
"Money is a megaphone for speech."

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.560
So the second is the one
I've already mentioned,

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.630
that the government interest in leveling

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.810
the playing should say
field is not compelling

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.580
and so it must give way
to fundamental rights

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.010
protected by the Constitution.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.560
And the third is that the only corruption

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.650
worth worrying about is
quid pro quo corruption.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.130
Of course we're hearing a lot
about quid pro quo corruption

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.200
at the moment,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.800
and unless you can actually show

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.990
the smoking gun of quid
pro quo corruption,

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.300
I give you something and
get something in return,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.210
then you can't show, there's
nothing to worry about

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.663
from the standpoint of the
corruption of the system.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.780
So that was what was launched
in 1976 by the Court.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.480
Now, this is vastly more
important than Citizens United

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.043
in the sense that, once
this decision was made,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.180
the changes that have led
us down this 40-year path

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.793
to Citizens United are more or less,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.450
nothing's inevitable in politics,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.588
but exceedingly likely to follow.

00:30:21.588 --> 00:30:25.353
I'll just mention a few other
decisions that the Court made.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.520
So in 1990, when the drift
to the right on the Court

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.310
was not as far as it
has subsequently gone,

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.210
the Court did say that corporations

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.790
didn't have the same
First Amendment rights

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:41.720
as individuals.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.050
So it was okay for the
Michigan legislature

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:49.050
to stop corporations from
making independent expenditures

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.010
to support candidates on the grounds

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.560
that "corporate wealth can
unduly influence elections."

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.480
So they were saying corporations

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.270
are not protected in the same way at least

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:05.133
as individuals by the Speech
Clause of the First Amendment.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.600
They don't have the same
First Amendment rights.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.710
And then, in that case,
the government interest

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.810
in the conduct of elections

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.500
and not in leveling the
playing field, if you'd like,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.010
not having undo corporate interest trumps.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.820
The reason I'm putting
the Michigan case there

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.600
is because that was what
was overruled in 2010

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.840
in Citizens United.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.810
Citizens United was
founded by Floyd Brown,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.580
a DC political consultant, in 1988.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.050
And it was an organization, you
can see here its big motive.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.767
It's "an organization dedicated

00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:54.847
"to restoring our government
to citizens' control.

00:31:54.847 --> 00:31:56.647
"Through a combination of education,

00:31:56.647 --> 00:31:58.707
"advocacy, and grassroots organization,

00:31:58.707 --> 00:32:01.737
"Citizens United seeks to reassert

00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:04.457
"the traditional American
values of limited government,

00:32:04.457 --> 00:32:06.597
"freedom of enterprise, strong families,

00:32:06.597 --> 00:32:09.137
"and national sovereignty and security.

00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:11.547
"Citizens United's goal is to restore

00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:14.317
"the Founding Fathers'
vision of a free nation

00:32:14.317 --> 00:32:16.767
"guided by the honesty, common sense,

00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:20.030
"and good will of its citizens."

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.663
So American as apple pie.

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:25.470
So what was at issue in this case

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.840
is that they have planned
to advertise a film

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.840
that was essentially an anti
Hilary Clinton commercial

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.170
shortly before the 2008
Democratic primaries

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.060
when she was still running
for the nomination.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.760
And at that time, federal law
had prohibited corporations

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.967
and unions from making what they called

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.510
"electioneering communications"

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.390
30 days prior to an election, the primary,

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.210
or 60 days prior to an election,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.520
or it's making any expenditures
advocating the election

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.120
or defeat of a candidate at any time.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.380
So there was some limit on the content

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.930
and some limit on the timing,

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.220
and the argument had been that

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.750
under the then prevailing Michigan law

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.750
that these were the kinds of constraints

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.300
that had been legitimate.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.080
And in Citizens United, the Court said no.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.750
The Court held instead
that Congress cannot limit

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.330
corporate expenditures,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.730
and so overruled its prior
decision in the Michigan case,

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.430
and said the First Amendment
rules in the same way

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.210
with respect to corporate expenditures

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.490
as it does to individuals.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.380
There's no risk of corruption here

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.280
so there's no, again, quid
pro quo is what counts.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.070
And the idea that the
Court should be involved

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.230
in protecting the shareholders
of corporations cannot stand.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.580
By that time, it was a long-established,

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.780
SOM students here will know,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.460
a long-established rule called
the business judgment rule

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.760
which said that while it's good, perhaps,

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.380
for corporations to maximize
shareholder returns,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.070
there's no requirement of that.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.760
And the business judgment rule says

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.830
that basically if the
shareholders don't like

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:26.830
the way a corporation
is managing the company,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.110
they can either sell their
shares, low-exist cost,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.550
or they can get new management.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.970
So it was not the business of the Court

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.770
to protect shareholders

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.253
from the political uses
of corporate money.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.540
So the assumption's now
that the corporations

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:51.300
have the same free speech
rights as individuals,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.230
and so any government interested

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.810
in leveling the playing field

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.010
isn't compelling and so must fall.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.810
And again, reaffirming this idea

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:05.810
that the only corruption
worth worrying about

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.920
is quid pro quo.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.570
Getting something in return

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.573
for giving a politician some money.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.660
Now, there's a subsequent
couple of decisions

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.830
that are less often talked
about than Citizens United

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.470
that I just wanna mention.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.320
So the first one was the same year.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.220
SpeechNow v. the Federal
Election Commission

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.770
by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.680
This is in the wake of Citizens United.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.750
Where they said contribution limits,

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.293
whether to independent advocacy groups

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.780
cannot be,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.520
to whether to individuals advocacy groups

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.020
or other organizations cannot be limited.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.500
So the idea here is that
you can make a contribution

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.403
to another organization
and that can't be limited.

00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:06.580
There's no risk of corruption
in the First Amendment rule.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.300
They said, though, that
Congress can require disclosure.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.270
So if I'm gonna give money to
a political action committee

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.270
or something like that, I might be,

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:21.270
it's reasonable for Congress
to require at least disclosure

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.260
that people will know
where the money came from.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.000
The public has an interest in knowing

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.260
who's speaking about a candidate

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.110
while making an argument in politics.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:38.250
Again, they're affirming this
idea, now become a mantra,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.800
that the only corruption
worth worrying about

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.500
is quid pro quo.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.390
But the second assumption they made

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:50.083
is that this idea of shining
light through publicity

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.850
would be enforceable,

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.390
that it would be possible to say

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.710
that corporations could give money

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.700
to political action committees

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.960
and, as long as they disclosed it,

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.780
there was no risk, if you'd
like, to the political system.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.360
It was certainly not a serious enough risk

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.340
to justify interfering with
the First Amendment rights

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.770
to make political
expenditures as they chose.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.620
As I say, good luck with that.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.850
- Here to help me make my move
to secrecy and obfuscation

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.760
completely transparent,

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.800
please welcome former general
counsel to the McCain campaign

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.820
and my personal lawyer, Mr. Trevor Potter.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:36.425
Trevor, nice to see you.
(audience cheers)

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:38.179
Do you want some?

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:39.440
Can I carve you some?

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.280
Do you want some Ham Rove?

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.113
- I'll wait 'til later.

00:37:42.113 --> 00:37:44.403
- Yeah, well, he's not kosher.

00:37:44.403 --> 00:37:45.620
(audience laughs)
All right.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.300
Now, Trevor, I've got all these people

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.220
down at the bottom of the screen

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.180
who've been giving me
money, individual Americans,

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.520
but I haven't gotten any
of the big corporate money,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.730
that's why I have a Super PAC.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.520
Why wouldn't a corporation give money?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.570
- Well, they'd been nervous about giving

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.220
in a way that their name
is publicly disclosed.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.270
People might object to what they've done.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.930
Their shareholders, their customers.

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:12.890
- Okay, so that's where a c4 comes in.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.630
A corporation or an
individual can give to a c4

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.279
and nobody gets to know that they did it,

00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:19.112
right?
- That's right.

00:38:19.112 --> 00:38:20.980
- Okay, so, how do I get one?

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.210
- And that money can be used for politics.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.150
- Oh great, that's good, too.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.680
- So we need to get you one.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.960
- As long as it goes through me,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.377
it can go to anything it wants.

00:38:29.377 --> 00:38:30.260
(audience laughs)

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.925
So how do I gets me one, Trevor?

00:38:32.925 --> 00:38:34.320
(audience laughs)
- Well.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.490
Lawyers often form Delaware corporations,

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.980
which we call shell corporations,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.253
that just sit there until they're needed.

00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:43.370
- So just some anonymous
shell corporation?

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:46.170
- Right, and I happen to have
one here in my briefcase.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.500
- Let's see it.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.830
Okay, what's it called?

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.284
- It's called Anonymous Shell Corporation.

00:38:51.284 --> 00:38:52.912
(audience laughs)

00:38:52.912 --> 00:38:55.030
- That's got a real ring to it, Trev.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.230
- Registered in Delaware.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.890
- Now, I don't have to
go to Delaware, do I?

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.579
- [Trevor] No, it's
already been done for you.

00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:02.126
- (whistles) Okay.

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:03.252
(audience laughs)

00:39:03.252 --> 00:39:05.350
Okay, (mumbles) Anonymous
Shell Corporation

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.400
filed in Delaware, I've got this.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.350
So now I have a c4?

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.150
- Now we need to turn it
into your shell corporation,

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.460
your anonymous one, and we
do that by having normally

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.980
a board of directors meeting.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.340
- And who's on the board of directors?

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.983
- Well, just you.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.410
- Sounds like a nice group of people.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.250
(audience laughs)
All right, let's do it.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.395
Let's call, (gavel thuds) okay.

00:39:26.395 --> 00:39:28.584
(Trevor and audience laugh)

00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:29.460
(gavel thuds)

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.554
And I've shattered my champaign glass.

00:39:31.554 --> 00:39:34.387
(audience laughs)

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.100
I hope there's no sensitive
electronic equipment down there.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.270
All right, (gavel thuds) call
to order, let's do this thing.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.860
- All right, so.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.930
This says that you are the sole
director of the corporation.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:47.763
- [Stephen] I am.

00:39:47.763 --> 00:39:50.590
- And that you are now electing yourself

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.700
president, secretary, and treasurer.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.824
- It sounds like a great board.

00:39:54.824 --> 00:39:56.290
(audience laughs)
- And you are

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.040
authorizing the corporation

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.840
to file the papers with
the IRS in May 2013.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.710
- So I could get money for my c4,

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.010
use that for political purposes,

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.000
and nobody knows anything about it

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.790
'til six months after the election?

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.623
- That's right.

00:40:13.623 --> 00:40:15.500
And even then, they wouldn't
know who your donors are.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.584
- That's my kind of campaign
finance registration.

00:40:17.584 --> 00:40:18.610
(audience laughs)

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.260
Okay, okay, so now I've signed it.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.300
I have a c4?

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.030
- You have a c4, it's up and going.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.280
- So without this,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.760
I am transparent.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.065
With this, I am opaque.

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:32.230
(audience laughs)
- That's it.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.133
- Without it, you get to know.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.800
With it, you go to hell.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.810
(Trevor and audience laugh)

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.290
Without it, here's who gave me my money.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:42.520
With it, you know what?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.170
Your mother gave me my money.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.170
(Trevor and audience laugh)

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.622
Well, I like that, Trev.

00:40:47.622 --> 00:40:50.840
(audience cheers)
(audience applauds)

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.673
Okay.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.680
Okay, so now I can get
corporate, individual donations

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.020
of unlimited amount for my c4.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.000
What can I do with that money?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.970
- Well, that c4 could
take out political ads

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.150
and attack candidates or
promote your favorite ones,

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.660
as long as it's not the principle purpose

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.700
for spending its money.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.813
- No, my principle purpose
is an educational entity.

00:41:13.813 --> 00:41:14.646
- There you go.

00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:16.943
- I wanna educate public that
gay people cause earthquakes.

00:41:16.943 --> 00:41:19.630
(audience laughs)

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.100
- There are probably some c4s doing that.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.850
- Can I take this c4 money

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.810
and then donate it to my Super PAC?

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.942
- You can.

00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:28.193
(audience exclaims)

00:41:28.193 --> 00:41:29.120
(audience laughs)

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.310
- But wait, wait.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.480
Super PACs are transparent.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.260
- Right--
- And the c4 is secret.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.480
So I can take secret donations off my c4

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.460
and give it to my supposedly
transparent Super PAC.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.400
- And it'll say, "Given by your c4."

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.190
- What is the difference between
that and money laundering?

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.240
(audience laughs)

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.832
- It's hard to say.

00:41:51.832 --> 00:41:52.800
(audience laughs)

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.800
- Well, Trevor, thank you
so much for setting me up

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.633
(audience cheers)
(audience applauds)

00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:57.395
in this brave new world.

00:41:57.395 --> 00:41:58.820
(gavel thuds)

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.190
Dismissed.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.683
Trevor Potter, everybody.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.763
- So, he called it right.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.880
What we see after SpeechNow
is enter the Super PAC,

00:42:15.374 --> 00:42:17.730
and you have political action committees

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.640
that can raise and spend
unlimited amounts of money

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.740
from corporations, unions,
individuals, and associations,

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.800
that is, from anyone.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.980
And so just people who are interested

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.053
in the details of this,

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.420
Super PACs can choose either to be

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:39.420
what had been known as a
527 or a 501c4 organization.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:46.460
So the 527s, these had
been created by the IRS

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.740
to allow organizations and committees

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.250
to raise and spend money
specifically to influence politics,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.410
but they had to report
donors and contributions.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:03.920
So they accepted donor
lists would be made public

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.000
in exchange for greater freedom

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.990
to directly influence election
initiatives, if you'd like.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.740
The 501c4, as you saw,

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.210
that's what was being
described in the video,

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.040
works a little differently.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.150
It's a nonprofit.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.820
It's just a little different from a 501c3,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.063
which is what Yale University is.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.567
It was created in 1913

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.350
with the intention of
creating tax exemptions

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.790
for civic and commercial organizations

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:43.020
that focus exclusively on social welfare.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.900
And it can also collect unlimited funds,

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.786
and here's what they were keying off of,

00:43:49.786 --> 00:43:53.640
it's 501c4s do not have to
disclose their donor lists.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.720
Basically, they forfeit their ability

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.070
to engage in politics
as a primary function

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.850
but they gain the ability

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.143
to keep the sources of
their funding anonymous.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.020
Somewhere along the line, however,

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:14.020
the interpretation of the 501c4
statute started to evolve.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.060
First of all, the word
exclusively educational

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.410
came to mean primarily educational.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.100
And, of course, once you
have a word like primarily,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.863
you need lawyers to interpret
what does primarily mean.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.620
And somewhere along the
line, it seems, in the 1960s,

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:47.500
the agencies started to
interpret primarily to mean 51%.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.090
It's not clear why, I've
done some digging into this.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.960
Perhaps there's a lobbying
story there, I don't know.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.640
But so what it basically means is that

00:45:04.678 --> 00:45:09.678
you've got to spend 51% on
your social welfare purpose,

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.583
that gay people cause earthquakes,

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:19.620
and you can then spend 49%
directly on political activity.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:24.550
And this is what gave rise
to the Lois Lerner scandal

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.180
in the Obama administration,

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.790
which some of you might remember.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:31.583
She was a mid-level operative in the IRS.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.320
They were getting floods and
floods of these new 501c4s.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.800
This was in the wake of
the Tea Party movement.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.320
And so she was tasked, or tasked herself,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.320
with investigating whether
they were doing the 49% or not.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.420
And she then got accused of
disproportionately investigating

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:58.710
conservative 501c4s,

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.440
and that blew up into
something of a scandal

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.920
that went viral.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.350
Well, that was all generated by this law.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.220
So, in effect, what it's done is it's said

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.760
that you can engage in
unlimited expenditures

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.630
without disclosure, the
slide is misleading,

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.890
I will fix it before I post it,

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:25.150
while optional disclosure, I
guess is sufficient to say,

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.243
without disclosure for 51%.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:32.140
Essentially paying a 51% quasi-tax.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.490
It's not really even a tax

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.370
because you can define
your social welfare purpose

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:38.993
to suit yourself.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.730
And so if you wanna see
what effect this had,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:47.480
this is Super PAC spending by disclosure.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.690
You can see that in the
2010 election cycle,

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.593
before all of this became operative,

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.640
most of the money was going
to companies that, whoops,

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:07.220
to 527s that were disclosing

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.470
and not very much was going to others.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.433
But after 2012, you can
see a lot more money

00:47:14.433 --> 00:47:19.340
started to go to the new 501c4 Super PACs,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.340
at least half of the spending
in that election cycle.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:29.470
So we've seen this is a
move into more dark money

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:33.530
than we had had before
operating in politics.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:38.530
The upshot is that contributions
to candidates or campaigns

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.830
can still be limited by
the federal government,

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.010
but independent expenditures
can't be limited

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.590
and contributions to organizations

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.130
that engage in expenditures.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.310
So contributions to
candidates can be limited

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:54.440
but contributions to organizations

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.423
that engage in expenditures
cannot be limited,

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.440
and reporting rules would require

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:06.110
a massive overhaul to be meaningful.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:11.110
So that has been the story
of campaign finance reform

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.420
in the American courts through 2010.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.553
I should mention one additional decision,

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:23.310
and this is 2014

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:27.390
McCutcheon v. the Federal
Election Commission.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.060
This is the only subsequent time

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.090
the Court has revisited campaign finance.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.860
And there, there had been a law

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.980
which had limited the number of candidates

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.063
that you could give money to.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.630
I think it was to five candidates

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.280
in any given election cycle,

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.370
and the amount you could give to a party

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.000
was also limited.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.740
And so that meant the
total amount you could give

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:59.623
in any two-year election
cycle came up to $117,200.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.310
You couldn't give more than that.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:09.310
And the Court said no,
why should you be limited

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.330
to only giving to five candidates?

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.570
The justification for
this combined restriction

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.090
was unwarranted.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.950
It's not tailored to
any particular purpose

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:25.653
that the government is
entitled to engage in.

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.970
Even though, actually, Buckley had upheld

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.580
aggregation limits, they said, again,

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.720
there's no quid pro quo here,

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.520
you're not giving money
to get anything in return.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.400
What's the difference

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.980
between giving money to five candidates

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.243
and giving money to 30 or 40 candidates?

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.360
Again, assuming quid pro
quo is the only corruption

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.020
worth worrying about.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:55.080
And a massive increase in inequality

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.010
of contributing power now.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:02.010
Instead of 117,200, you
could give 3.5 million

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.203
in contributions in any election cycle.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:13.230
So, again, much more
inequality of influence

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.863
in the world of contributions.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.760
Now some people say this isn't so terrible

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.230
because it may attract more money

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.530
into contributions to candidates

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.140
and less money into dark money.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.910
Rick Pildes at the NYU
Law School, for example,

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.970
has made this argument.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.150
So the idea is that if you can give

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.530
more money to the candidates,

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.610
you won't spend it on dark money,

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:44.073
and so we might actually
get less darkness.

00:50:44.945 --> 00:50:47.113
At this point, I think that's speculative.

00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:52.100
The jury is out.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.100
So that is the jot and tittle
of the Court's involvement

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.030
in campaign finance reform efforts.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.260
Before I turn to the demand side,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.940
I just wanted to say something

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.310
about the changing media
context of all of this

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:14.970
because we're living in
a very different world

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.570
from the world that existed in 1976.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.080
Apart from what we make of this equation

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.840
of money with speech that Byron White

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.780
and many others have
subsequently criticized.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.780
In 1976 there were
basically three TV channels.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.750
And because of the
scarcity of TV channels,

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.310
the federal government came up with,

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.780
this was not done through the
courts or even by Congress,

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.250
it was actually done in
the executive branch,

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:52.693
they came up with, the FEC
came up with something,

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:59.990
it wasn't the SEC but it was,
I forget exactly which agency,

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.330
but they came up with this,

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.480
Federal Communications
Commission, the FCC,

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.880
came up with something
called the fairness doctrine.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.100
And the notion there was that because

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.120
there's a limited number of channels,

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.120
that if a TV channel puts
on one point of view,

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.960
they must put on a competing point of view

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.210
from the other side.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.040
So there was this notion of achieving

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.120
some kinds of political balance.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.590
And this was never actually
challenged in the courts

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:36.950
so the Court never ruled on it,

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.860
and we had the fairness
doctrine until the 1980s

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.180
during the Reagan administration.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.260
And during the Reagan administration,

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.053
we also had the advent
of cable television.

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:52.430
And the FCC said, well, now

00:52:53.594 --> 00:52:56.160
there's an unlimited number of channels,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.940
so there's no reason to
have the fairness doctrine.

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.830
And then we got satellite, so
instead of 80 or 90 channels

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.270
we have hundreds of channels.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.040
So there's no reason to
have the fairness doctrine

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.660
because the logic for
the fairness doctrine

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.680
was the scarcity of channels.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.910
Now, there's no scarcity.

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:20.280
In fact, more or less
unlimited number of channels.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.420
And so the Reagan administration

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.360
abandoned the fairness doctrine

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.017
and that started us on
the political consequences

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.850
of increasingly segmented media markets.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.040
The world that we moved
to being a world in which

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.690
liberals get their news from MSNBC,

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.113
conservatives from Fox News or Breitbart,

00:53:51.137 --> 00:53:53.850
and then of course onto
the world of social media,

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.587
the world of people getting
news from Facebook and so on.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.530
And so we're now in a world in which

00:54:06.912 --> 00:54:11.912
it's almost impossible
to have any requirement

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:16.720
that different points of
view confront one another

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.560
in the sense that, say, John Stuart Mill

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:24.430
talked about in the competition for ideas,

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.560
the idea that if you think about

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.540
prime minister's questions
in the UK Parliament

00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:36.790
where the prime minister
has to stand there

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:37.720
and be questioned

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.690
and defend his or her
views to the opposition.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:45.850
We saw earlier Margaret
Thatcher defending her views

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:50.560
against her Labour critics
when she was leaving office.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.170
We never have that now.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:54.330
Political speech is not about

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:57.700
institutionalized argument over policies,

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.450
it's rather about mobilizing
your own supporters.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.170
It's about you speak to the people

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.730
who already agree with you.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:09.730
We know from Kahneman
and Sunstein's research

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.670
that I referred to last time,

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.580
that tends to make people more extreme.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:19.000
And so political speech is
really about mobilization,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.230
mobilization of people within your world

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.450
of like-minded people,

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:30.240
and not about argument over policy.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.240
And that is a development
that is underpinned

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:39.600
by other changes in the political system

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.080
that I'm going to get to briefly today

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.030
but more fully later on.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:51.030
So let's look for the last few
minutes at the demand side.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.370
We've been talking this entire lecture

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:55.480
about the supply side.

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.960
We've been talking about why people

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.010
wanna spend money on politics

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:04.060
and what kind of influence
they think they can get

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.483
from spending money on politics.

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:11.450
Whether it corrupts the system or not

00:56:13.264 --> 00:56:15.960
and what sort of definition
of corruption we should have.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.400
But why is it that politicians want money?

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.163
Why do they need so much money?

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:27.610
We spend much more money
in politics in this country

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.420
than in almost any other country.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.610
Why do politicians need money, yeah?

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.560
- [Man] They attempt to
put out their message.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:38.560
They attempt to buy advertisement
from one side (mumbles).

00:56:39.192 --> 00:56:43.817
- Okay, so they want to
put out their message.

00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:47.610
But British and German and
Dutch and Australian politicians

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:49.700
wanna put out their messages too

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.270
and they don't have so much
need for money in politics.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:54.963
So any, why?

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:58.153
Who else, okay, yeah?

00:57:05.876 --> 00:57:08.510
- [Man] There are no primaries in the UK

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:11.833
and the election cycle
takes exactly six weeks.

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.540
- So frequent elections
and a staggered cycle,

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.103
as well as primaries.

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:24.220
So we have essentially
permanent campaigning

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.450
and campaigns are much longer.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.530
In most parliamentary systems,

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.200
you call an election

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.840
three or four weeks before the election.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.840
There's a very short election
cycle, so that's one reason.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.240
And of course, if you have primaries,

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.360
you need money for the primaries.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.360
So those are among the reasons
people need so much money.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.053
Any other reasons?

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.073
Yeah?

00:57:57.145 --> 00:57:59.570
- [Man] It's seen as a measure
of support for the candidate.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:02.750
- Seen as a measure of
support for a candidate.

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:06.520
So we see how do you
get to be on the stage

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.920
in the current democratic debates?

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.650
You've got to not only show

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:13.200
that you've risen to a
certain level in the polls,

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.400
but you've also gotta
have raised enough money

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.080
from some specified number
of independent contributors.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.913
So it's a way of demonstrating
that you can get support.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:31.100
Again, it's not obvious
why that differentiates

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.190
American politics from other countries.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:36.023
Yeah?

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.960
- [Woman] Well, for
presidential elections,

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.850
this is a huge country
and people need to have

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:44.290
teams all over the place.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:46.190
And unlike a parliamentary system

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:49.060
where the local elections then govern

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.680
who comes in power and so forth,

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.710
here, you need to have a
completely national campaign,

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:58.660
which becomes very, very expensive.

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.503
- Well, I mean, you certainly,

00:59:03.184 --> 00:59:06.200
in many countries you have
to have national campaigns,

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.840
and first and foremost, you
have to win in your district,

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.310
you need the money to win
in your district here.

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:19.810
But I think you're onto
something nonetheless

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.590
about thinking about the difference

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:25.383
between national campaigning
and local campaigning.

00:59:26.812 --> 00:59:28.062
There's a hand over here.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.305
- [Woman] I'm thinking about investments.

00:59:42.305 --> 00:59:45.150
So, like the stock market.

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:49.000
Almost like maybe they'll
take in the finances

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.720
and then invest in bigger corporations

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.523
and look for those corporations
to put their name back out.

00:59:55.523 --> 00:59:57.823
It's almost like a partnership.

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.420
- Well, I think focusing
on people investing

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.060
is also part of it, and
political investing.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.780
Here's a way to think about it,

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:12.780
that we have very weak
parties in the United States,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:18.150
and I'll say more about what
makes a party a weak party.

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.030
Part of it is primaries.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:24.210
But a weak party is a party

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.600
that is very decentralized in its control.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.600
So in a country with
stronger political parties,

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.844
such as Britain,

01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:39.844
the party has a big say in who
the candidates are gonna be.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.650
They don't have primaries,
as somebody pointed out,

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.130
we have primaries.

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.993
So another way of putting it is,

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.403
in our system all
campaigning has to be retail.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:56.440
And retail campaigning
is much more expensive

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.340
than wholesale campaigning

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.210
because every person
is running on their own

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:04.410
for their own seat,

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.310
and they need a lot of money to do that,

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:11.123
and they can be threaded in
their own individual seat.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.540
Some of you probably heard
on the news this morning

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:20.540
reports that there's some
35 Republicans in the Senate

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:25.910
who privately would support

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.760
convicting Donald Trump

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.680
if the impeachment resolution
goes through the House,

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.920
but publicly will not.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.340
And the reason, and people
come out and say it,

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:44.340
they say, "If you did,
you would immediately face

01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:47.530
"a primary challenge in your district."

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:51.390
And so everybody has to,

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.830
if you'd like, in retail campaigning,

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:55.870
it's every person for themself.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:59.140
In wholesale campaigning,
you're part of a team

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.650
that is trying to win as a team.

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:07.650
And so in our system, politicians
need vast amounts of money

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:15.190
because they have to get elected retail.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:17.450
All politics is local.

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.990
It's a famous American aphorism,

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:24.270
but that means all politics is retail.

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.680
So there might be benefits
of politics being local

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.030
but the cost is that
politics is very expensive.

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:37.030
And of course once you have
a lot of retail campaigning,

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.780
it also turns raising money

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.800
into something like an arms race,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.560
because if you don't raise
as much as your opponent,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.520
you're not gonna be able,

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.840
you're not gonna be able
to have enough money

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.070
perhaps to get on the debate stage

01:02:55.070 --> 01:03:00.070
or to get enough media
time in order to prevail.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:05.020
And so this is why public funding limits

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.210
are so inadequate,

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.373
because what happens is, no
matter where they're set,

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:16.070
people soon discover that
they can raise more money

01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:17.940
if they don't take the public funding.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.140
The idea is if you take the public funds,

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.890
then you've gotta limit your fundraising.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:30.890
But the last time the capital
was increased was before 2008

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.130
and President Obama,
who was the first person

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:38.610
to use crowdsource fundraising,

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.700
realized very quickly that he
could raise a lot more money

01:03:43.715 --> 01:03:44.548
than the limit.

01:03:44.548 --> 01:03:45.480
I forgot what it was then,

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.900
it was several hundred million dollars,

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.500
but his was the first million-dollar
presidential campaign.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.580
So public funding limits don't work

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.100
in a world in which people

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.650
can raise as much
private money as possible

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:06.210
and in a world in which you're basically

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:09.670
trying to communicate
with your base voters,

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:12.390
you're trying to communicate to the people

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.303
who mostly agree with you.

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:19.310
And so that's one of the reasons why

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.490
we find it so difficult to limit

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:26.780
the role of money in politics.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.710
Some other reasons

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.850
why there's so much
demand for money is that,

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.240
I said to you earlier
when I was talking about

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:44.160
the resurgent right and
the anti-tax movement

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.040
that a lot of those
bodies invested heavily

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.560
in think tanks because they
thought the universities

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.460
were dominated by the left

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.600
and it'd be much efficient
to spend the money

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.600
in places like Heritage, the
American Enterprise Institute,

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.400
the Cato Institute, and so on.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.720
Now, a lot of money,
particularly in response to

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.290
these recent Court decisions,

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:16.163
is moving from the think tanks.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.160
The think tank gap between Republicans

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.760
and Democratic think
tanks has closed somewhat

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.540
and the money it seems is
going into these 501c4s,

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.410
and that, again, means,

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:34.450
from the point of view of
the arms race of politics,

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:38.650
that your opponents are gonna
have more money spent on them

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:43.650
and so you therefore need
to get it spent on yourself.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.410
And so, again, we find that the remedies

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:50.963
sometimes make the problem worse.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:57.350
Another point just about the arms race.

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:00.430
I think that this is an area

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.340
that's actually right for reform

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.010
because politicians hate it.

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:10.010
They hate, if you do any
interviewing of candidates,

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.010
you'll see this, politicians hate it

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:15.630
because they have to spend
all their time raising money

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.590
and because they're then controlled

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.440
by the people who give them the money,

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.590
and they don't like it.

01:06:21.457 --> 01:06:25.660
And the structure of an
arms race is you can't stop.

01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:29.750
Underneath it is something
called the prisoner's dilemma.

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.560
Even though it would be in the interest

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.793
of both of you to stop raising money,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.690
if you could agree to do that,

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:39.190
the logic of the situation
keeps driving people

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:41.890
to raise more and more and more money.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:44.520
And so actually politicians,

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520
the vast majority of them would like

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.990
to get something to stop the arms race,

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:54.557
which is why they passed
the campaign bill in 1974

01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:00.440
that we began with over
Gerald Ford's veto.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.000
And the reason is that they were trying

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.560
to put a constraint on the arms race

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.920
so that they wouldn't
have to raise this money.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.430
So but for the Court, this
problem wouldn't exist.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:17.940
And I think it's, as I
said, a salutary reminder

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:22.663
of the cost of having
independent judiciaries.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:29.740
One final point is that
there's been a lot of talk

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.210
about crowdsource funding.

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.590
Maybe this is the antidote,

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:38.830
this is the antidote to
big money in politics.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.430
You know, lots of millions and millions

01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:42.470
of little contributions, isn't that great?

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.553
It's like democracy is in the streets.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.320
People can give one or $2 and, as I said,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.310
actually Barack Obama was the first person

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:57.530
to use crowdsource funding in a big way.

01:07:57.530 --> 01:08:01.000
Bernie Sanders is very effective
at crowdsource funding.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.300
And so a lot of people have said, well,

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.340
maybe there'll be a technical fix here

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:11.340
that we will get to counterweight
the role of big money.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.080
But what the research shows is that

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.860
even people who give small amounts

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.520
tend to not be representatives
of their districts.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.320
They tend to be activists
on the fringes of parties,

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.320
they tend to be people funding
groups like the Tea Party

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.770
or groups on the far left
of the Democratic Party.

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:46.770
So the idea that you're gonna
get less extreme views funded,

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.000
particularly people who give any money

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.040
outside of their own district

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.610
tend to have very extreme views.

01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:56.130
Almost nobody gives money
outside their own district

01:08:56.130 --> 01:09:00.600
who doesn't have, is not on
extremes of their parties.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.150
So the idea that this is gonna
be a way to sort of restore

01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:07.970
the influence of the
median voter in politics

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:12.360
is not something we should
get too excited about.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.350
On Thursday we're gonna turn
to part two of the course

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.120
and we'll look at democracy's
fourth wave, question mark,

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:28.063
as it emerged in the wake of the Cold War.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.923
(gentle music)

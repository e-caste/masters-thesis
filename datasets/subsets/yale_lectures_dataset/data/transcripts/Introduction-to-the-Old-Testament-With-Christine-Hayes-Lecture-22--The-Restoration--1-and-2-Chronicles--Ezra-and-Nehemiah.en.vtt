00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.668
Professor Christine
Hayes: Last time we started

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:06.487
looking at the psalms and a
number of different genres or

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.350
forms in which the psalms
appear.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.667
We were just looking at a psalm
last time which seems to

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.743
explicitly reject the
Deuteronomistic interpretation

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.940
of the national history and the
national tragedy,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.583
depicting Israel as innocent,
and rebuking God for his

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.647
inaction.
There's another psalm in this

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:25.180
genre that I'd like to read
from.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.010
This is Psalm 44,
selective passages:

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.030
"…In God we glory at
all times,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.330
and praise Your name
unceasingly.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.680
Yet You have rejected and
disgraced us;

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.170
You do not go with our armies.
 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.270
…You let them devour us like
sheep;

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.900
You disperse us among the
nations.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.870
You sell Your people for no
fortune,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.770
You set no high price on them…
All this has come upon us,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.230
yet we have not forgotten You,
or been false to Your covenant."

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.780
[Very different from what the
prophets have been screaming!]

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.390
"Our hearts have not gone
astray,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.920
nor have our feet swerved from
Your path,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.367
though You cast us,
crushed, to where the sea

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:01.181
monster is,
and covered us over with

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.000
deepest darkness.
 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.619
If we forgot the name of our God
and spread forth our hands to a

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.790
foreign god,
God would surely search it out,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.510
for He knows the secrets of the
heart.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.209
It is for Your sake that we are
slain all day long,

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.550
that we are regarded as sheep
to be slaughtered.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.780
Rouse Yourself;
why do you sleep, O Lord?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.720
Awaken, do not reject us
forever!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.631
Why do You hide Your face,
ignoring our affliction and

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.410
distress?
We lie prostrate in the dust;

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.960
our body clings to the ground.
 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.748
Arise and help us,
redeem us, as befits Your

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:31.861
faithfulness."
So here's a psalm full of anger

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:35.793
that contains an explicit denial
of the rhetorically inflamed

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:39.659
charges against Israel that we
read in many of the prophetic

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.489
books.
We have not forgotten

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.550
You, we haven't been
false to Your covenant,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.674
our hearts haven't gone
astray, we haven't

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:46.640
swerved from Your path.
 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.080
Why are You behaving this way?
 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.280
This astonishing protestation
of innocence that accuses God of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.310
sleeping on the job is
reminiscent of Job.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.476
In a way, the two conflicting
viewpoints that we see running

00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:01.945
through a lot of this
literature--one in which:

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.722
there is suffering,
therefore there must be sin,

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:06.981
Israel has sinned horribly:
and the other:

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.909
there is inexplicable
suffering,

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.965
we haven't done anything that
would deserve this,

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:13.150
anything at all--it really is
reminiscent of Job.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.322
It seems to give us these two
perspectives on Job's suffering

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:16.009
as an individual.
 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.169
We see that now played out on
the level of the nation.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.564
What we have here is a view
that is asserting God's

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:27.080
negligence rather than Israel's
guilt.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.549
Then you can contrast psalms
like 44, the one I've just read,

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.348
and 74, which I read at the end
of the last lecture,

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.360
with Psalms 78 and 106.
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.801
These psalms belong to the
category of hymns,

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.854
and some people call this
category 'hymns in celebration

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:46.184
of divine action in Israel's
history'--the sort of historical

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:49.569
reviews that praise God for all
he has done for Israel;

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.836
and they toe the
Deuteronomistic line in their

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:53.699
recapitulation of Israel's
history.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.764
From the Creation,
from the Exodus and on to the

00:02:56.764 --> 00:03:00.415
conquest of the Promised Land,
they stress Israel's utter

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:01.979
indebtedness to God.
 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.219
God has patiently endured
Israel's constant faithlessness.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.394
So when you juxtapose these two
types of psalms,

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:09.060
they're just remarkably
different.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.659
He performed marvels in
the site of their fathers,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.439
in the land of Egypt,
the plain of Zoan.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.319
He split the sea and took them
through it;

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.210
He made the waters stand like a
wall.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.896
It continues:
"…He split rocks in the

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:21.248
wilderness"--so it's a
recounting of all the marvelous

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:23.849
things that God has done,
But they went on sinning

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.979
against Him,
defying the most high in the

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.870
parched land.
To test God was in their mind

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.770
when they demanded food for
themselves.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.062
They spoke against God, saying,
"Can God spread a feast in the

00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:36.233
wilderness?
True, He struck the rock and

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:38.030
waters flowed,
streams gushed forth;

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.569
but can He provide bread?
 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.479
Can He supply His people with
meat?

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.259
It's interesting that this is
in the third person;

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.190
they did all these
terrible sinful things.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.487
The psalm that I just read
previously that protests

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.510
Israel's innocence is in the
first person.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.319
We have not strayed at all.
 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.031
We've been completely faithful
to you, why are you treating us

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.613
this way?
So God's faithful actions,

00:03:56.613 --> 00:04:01.444
Israel's faithless responses
are featured in the psalm that I

00:04:01.444 --> 00:04:03.780
just read and also in 106.
 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.198
They toe the Deuteronomistic
line, and again we see this

00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:10.120
clear attempt to explain
Israel's tragic end.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.599
Here again the tendency is to
blame Israel and to justify God

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.533
at all costs.
We move on now to the genre of

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:20.327
psalms.
Actually, these are two genres

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.714
that I'm putting together,
the genres of blessing and

00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:25.171
cursing.
Obviously they're rather

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.402
antithetical.
But first of all,

00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:31.064
psalms of blessing are psalms
that invoke God to bless the

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.135
righteous.
It might be the nation Israel

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:35.180
or it might be the righteous
within the nation,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.918
and to punish or afflict the
wicked, and again,

00:04:37.918 --> 00:04:41.610
that can be enemy nations or it
can be the wicked within Israel

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.920
and other nations.
 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.431
And sometimes these psalms can
be quite shocking in their

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.250
violence and in their fury.
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.993
Psalm 137, "By the rivers of
Babylon"--very rarely people

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:55.670
read all the way to the end of
that particular psalm.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.737
It's very poignant at the
beginning, but at the very end

00:04:58.737 --> 00:05:01.749
it calls for vengeance on the
Babylonians who destroyed

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.468
Jerusalem,
verses 8 and 9,

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:05.158
"Fair Babylon,
you predator,

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.725
/ a blessing on him who repays
you in kind / what you have

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.982
inflicted on us;
a blessing on him who seizes

00:05:11.982 --> 00:05:15.449
your babies / and dashes them
against the rocks!"

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.220
Psalm 109 contains this very
lengthy list of terrible

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.571
afflictions that the psalmist is
asking God to smite his foes

00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:27.269
with (that was a poorly
constructed sentence!),

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:31.059
that the psalmist is asking God
to, I don't want to say bestow,

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.709
but inflict upon his foe.
 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:35.334
Verses 8 and 10:
"May his days be few,

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:37.959
may another take over his
position.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.022
May his children be orphans,
/ his wife a widow"--that's a

00:05:41.022 --> 00:05:42.850
nice way of saying "may he die."
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.890
May his children wander
from their hovels,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.420
begging in search of [bread].
 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.029
...May he be clothed in a curse
like a garment,

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.010
may it enter his body like
water,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.199
his bones like oil.
 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.410
Let it be like the cloak he
wraps around him,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.199
like the belt he always wears.
 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.290
May the Lord thus repay my
accusers,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.740
all those who speak evil
against me.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.975
So again, it's hardly the
simple piety that we often

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:06.259
associate with the Book of
Psalms.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.620
The last category I just want
to briefly mention is a category

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.480
of psalms that have a reflective
or meditative tone.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.430
These are psalms of wisdom,
psalms in praise of instruction

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.649
or Torah and meditation.
 

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.552
They are somewhat proverbial in
nature, many of them will begin

00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:28.558
with the sort of stock phrase,
"Happy is the man who…" so we

00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:31.841
see that in Psalm 128:
Happy are all who fear

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:33.879
the Lord,
who follow His ways.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.750
You shall enjoy the fruit of
your labors;

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.639
you shall be happy and shall
prosper.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.709
Your wife shall be like a
fruitful vine within your house;

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:43.730
your sons, like olive saplings
around your table.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.839
So shall the man who fears the
Lord be blessed."

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.431
Or "reveres the Lord" –
[that]

00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:50.329
is the sense of "fear"
there.

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:54.371
Many psalms we've seen seem to
presuppose worship in the

00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.339
temple, and can even have that
antiphonal character,

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.509
the call and response,
or call and echo character.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.342
But there are three that,
instead, have this theme of

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.660
meditating upon or delighting in
the Torah;

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.277
that's Psalm 1,
Psalm 19, and Psalm 119

00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:13.000
(conveniently enough!).
 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.671
119 is the longest psalm
because it's written in acrostic

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.049
form.
There are different stanzas,

00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:24.209
a different stanza for each
letter of the alphabet (22

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:27.370
letters) and there are eight
lines in each stanza,

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.402
all eight lines beginning with
that letter of the alphabet,

00:07:30.402 --> 00:07:32.180
so it's a very,
very long psalm.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.100
The psalm represents Torah as
an object of study and devotion.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.931
Studying Torah makes one wise
and happy: Psalm 19,

00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:42.310
verses 8 through 11,
The teaching of the Lord

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.209
is perfect,
renewing life;

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.100
the decrees of the Lord are
enduring,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.996
making the simple wise;
The precepts of the Lord are

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.759
just,
rejoicing the heart;

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:52.430
the instruction of the Lord is
lucid,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.250
making the eyes light up.
 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.900
The fear (or reverence) of the
Lord is pure,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.684
abiding forever;
the judgments of the Lord are

00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.080
true,
righteous altogether,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.480
more desirable than gold,
than much fine gold;

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.709
sweeter than honey,
than drippings of the

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:08.574
comb.
So this elevation of Torah

00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:13.664
reflects the shift that begins
or starts to occur in the Second

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:16.868
Temple Period,
the late Second Temple Period,

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:19.339
in which Torah is of growing
importance.

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:23.283
In about two minutes we're
going to start to talk about

00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:27.520
this period and the importance
and centrality of Torah--its

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.683
centrality in terms of study
--and the study of Torah as a

00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:35.005
form of worship.
So there are many different

00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:37.799
ways to categorize and classify
the psalms.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.709
Many individual psalms seem to
combine units that belong to

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.259
different categories.
 

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:45.677
So, for example,
you have Psalm 22 which opens

00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:48.310
as a lament, "My God,
My God why have You forsaken

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.129
me?"
That's the well-known RSV

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.129
translation, and then it changes
to a hymn of praise.

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:57.548
It concludes with this--it goes
on into a kind of confident

00:08:57.548 --> 00:08:59.440
triumph.
At least one psalm,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.771
Psalm 68, really defies any
kind of rigid categorization,

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:06.399
so we can't be too strict in
trying to impose these forms.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:09.172
They are helpful guides to the
interpretation of the Psalms,

00:09:09.172 --> 00:09:11.240
but again, we can't be too
rigid about it.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.448
But from the sampling that
we've seen it should be apparent

00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:19.802
that the Psalms are a microcosm
of the religious insights and

00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:22.559
convictions of ancient
Israelites.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:25.039
Perhaps because so many of them
lack historical

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:27.679
specificity--some of them are
quite historical;

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.039
some of them in fact recount
Israel's history in order to

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:34.415
praise God, but many of them,
very, very many of them lack

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:37.824
any real historical specificity,
and that is probably the reason

00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:40.747
that the Psalms have become a
great source for personal

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:43.019
spirituality in Western
civilization.

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:46.362
Some of them were composed
perhaps as many as 3000 years

00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:48.914
ago, and yet,
they can be inspiring or they

00:09:48.914 --> 00:09:51.710
can feel relevant to
contemporary readers.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.395
They can provide an opportunity
to confess one's failings or to

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.931
proclaim good intentions,
or to rail against misfortune,

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.828
or to cry out against
injustice, or to request

00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:04.787
assistance,
or to affirm trust in divine

00:10:04.787 --> 00:10:09.269
providence, or to simply express
emotions of praise and joy,

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:13.458
and wonder at creation,
or reflect on human finitude in

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.940
the face of divine infinitude.
 

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.654
I mentioned briefly the
centrality of Torah--actually

00:10:19.654 --> 00:10:23.654
no--let me finish talking about
Psalms and also move onto

00:10:23.654 --> 00:10:27.868
another major poetic work then
we'll come back to talk about

00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:29.940
the Restoration period.
 

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:35.299
Another poetic book within the
anthology of the Hebrew Bible is

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:39.190
the little work known as the
Song of Songs.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.363
And for many people this is
perhaps the most surprising book

00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:45.980
to be included in the Hebrew
canon.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.747
It's a beautiful and very
erotic love song that celebrates

00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:54.009
human sexuality and physical
passion.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:57.504
The opening line seems to be a
late superscription that

00:10:57.504 --> 00:11:01.536
attributes the book to Solomon,
and it seems more likely

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:06.039
however that these sensuous love
lyrics are post-exilic.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:11.853
The attribution to Solomon was
probably fueled by the fact that

00:11:11.853 --> 00:11:15.198
in 1 Kings 4,
we read that Solomon--or

00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:20.045
there's a tradition there that
Solomon uttered 3,000 Proverbs

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:23.002
and 1,005 songs.
So it seems natural to

00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:27.012
attribute this song to Israel's
most prolific composer of songs

00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:29.600
and proverbs,
according to tradition.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.822
The speaker in the poem
alternates, most often it is a

00:11:33.822 --> 00:11:36.029
woman.
She seems to be addressing her

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.045
beloved.
Sometimes she addresses other

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.909
women, the daughters of
Jerusalem.

00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:44.033
At times the speaker is a man,
but he's not identified as

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:46.339
Solomon.
Solomon's name is mentioned

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:48.955
about six times,
but Solomon is not said to be

00:11:48.955 --> 00:11:52.442
one of the speakers and for the
most part the main speaker is

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:55.615
female.
There's a pastoral setting for

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:58.578
the book.
The two young lovers express

00:11:58.578 --> 00:12:02.779
their passion through and amid
the beauties of nature.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:07.079
There are frequent references
to gardens, and vineyards,

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:09.893
and fruit, and flowers,
and perfumes,

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:13.879
and doves, and flocks of goats,
and shorn ewes.

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:16.293
There are very vivid
descriptions of the physical

00:12:16.293 --> 00:12:17.450
beauty of the lovers.
 

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.240
They are described in highly
erotic passages.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.049
Translations of the Song of
Songs vary tremendously as you

00:12:24.049 --> 00:12:27.057
might imagine,
so I'm going to read one little

00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:30.799
section from the translation by
someone named Walsh,

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:33.520
C.E.
Walsh, which I think captures

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.303
the tremendous eroticism in some
of the passages of Song of

00:12:38.303 --> 00:12:40.226
Songs:
I slept,

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.970
but my heart was awake.
 

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.360
Listen, my lover is knocking.
 

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.300
"Open to me my sister, my love,
my dove, my perfect one,

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.034
for my head is wet with dew…"
My lover thrusts his hand into

00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:54.370
the hole,
and my insides yearned for him,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.970
I arose to open to my lover,
and my hands dripped with myrrh,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.060
my fingers with liquid myrrh,
upon the handles of the lock.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.096
I opened to my lover,
but he was gone.

00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:06.899
[Walsh 2006,111-12]
These poems are very unique.

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:10.883
They give expression to the
erotic feelings of a woman and,

00:13:10.883 --> 00:13:14.179
as I say, translations will
vary tremendously.

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:18.297
According to Jewish tradition,
the ancient Rabbis debated over

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:22.820
whether or not the Song of Songs
should be included in the canon.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.808
And it was Rabbi Akiva,
a late first- early

00:13:25.808 --> 00:13:28.940
second-century sage,
whose view prevailed.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.244
He declared "the whole world
was only created,

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:33.343
so to speak,
for the day on which the Song

00:13:33.343 --> 00:13:34.879
of Songs would be given to it.
 

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:36.908
Why?
Because all the writings are

00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:39.820
Holy, but the Song of Songs is
the Holy of Holies."

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.876
But for some religious
authorities over the centuries,

00:13:42.876 --> 00:13:46.221
the candid descriptions of
passionate love proved to be too

00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:48.451
much,
and so the explicit content of

00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:50.961
the book (which contains no
reference to God,

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:53.397
by the way;
God is not mentioned anywhere

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:56.051
in the Song of Songs,
so it seems to have been a

00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.761
completely secular poem
originally)--the explicit

00:13:58.761 --> 00:14:02.149
content of the book has at times
been interpreted away.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:05.549
So not only do we have
translations that tone down a

00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:09.415
great deal of the eroticism,
but we also have a tradition of

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.785
interpretation that interprets
away a lot of the explicit

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.169
content of the text.
 

00:14:14.169 --> 00:14:17.817
So we have trends within Jewish
tradition that read the book as

00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:21.052
a metaphor or an expression of
God's love for his chosen

00:14:21.052 --> 00:14:24.092
people, Israel.
Christians have allegorized the

00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:27.937
song, seeing it as an expression
of Christ's love for his bride

00:14:27.937 --> 00:14:29.860
who is the spiritual church.
 

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.177
And I think some--I think all
of the sections will be dealing

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:33.529
with the Song of Songs this
week,

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:36.156
so you should have an
interesting time looking at some

00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:38.039
of the interpretations of this
text.

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:41.511
Now I want to move on a little
bit more to the historical

00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:45.106
background of some of the books
that we'll be looking at in

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:48.950
today's lecture and then also
the last couple of lectures.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:54.200
We left the Israelites in exile
in Babylon.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.414
And in 539 BCE the Babylonian
Empire was itself defeated by

00:14:58.414 --> 00:15:02.120
the Persians under the
leadership of Cyrus--Cyrus of

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.980
Persia.
In 539 he manages to establish

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.240
the largest empire that's been
seen in the Ancient Near East to

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.723
date.
It stretches from Egypt all the

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:15.029
way north up to Asia Minor which
is modern-day Turkey,

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:18.460
and all the way over to Eastern
Iran; a huge empire.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.466
Unlike other ancient empires,
the Persian Empire espoused a

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:28.817
policy of cultural and religious
independence for its conquered

00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:33.031
subjects.
The famous Cyrus Cylinder--this

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:38.816
is a nine inch long fired clay
cylinder and it's covered in

00:15:38.816 --> 00:15:44.899
cuneiform writing--it tells of
Cyrus' conquest of Babylon.

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:47.861
The conquest is described as
being at the command of

00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.068
Babylon's god,
Marduk, so obviously the

00:15:50.068 --> 00:15:53.669
Babylonians' god Marduk wanted
"our Cyrus of Persia" to be able

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:56.049
to come in and conquer this
nation.

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:59.274
It tells of his conquest and it
tells of Cyrus' policy of

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:02.729
allowing captives to return to
their homelands and to rebuild

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:05.090
their temples and worship their
gods.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.754
This is consistent;
this archaeological find is

00:16:07.754 --> 00:16:11.230
consistent with the picture
that's presented in the Bible.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.355
According to the biblical text
we'll be discussing soon,

00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:19.705
Cyrus in 538 gave the Judean
exiles permission to return to

00:16:19.705 --> 00:16:22.929
Jerusalem and reconstruct their
temple.

00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:25.304
The exiles did return;
many of the exiles

00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:27.252
returned.
They returned to what was now a

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:29.320
Persian province:
it's the province of Yehud;

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.130
I don't think I wrote that up
there.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.250
 
 

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.967
Yehud is the name now of Judea
and Yehud is where we're going

00:16:36.967 --> 00:16:38.330
to get the word Jew.
 

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:43.490
Yehudi is the word Jew;
one who belongs to the province

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.992
of Yehud.
So many of the exiles returned

00:16:45.992 --> 00:16:49.316
to this now-Persian province
Yehud, and they exercised a fair

00:16:49.316 --> 00:16:51.090
degree of self determination.
 

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.942
Now, periodization of Jewish
history tends to center on these

00:16:55.942 --> 00:17:00.714
events, so the period from 586
to 538 or so--that's known as

00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:04.164
exilic period.
Most scholars maintain that the

00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:07.703
traditions of the priestly
source, the traditions of the

00:17:07.703 --> 00:17:11.371
Deuteronomistic source had
pretty well reached their final

00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:12.980
form in those years.
 

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.694
Obviously, older traditions go
into the composition of those

00:17:16.694 --> 00:17:20.472
corpora, but they reach their
final form for the most part in

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:23.635
that period.
So the post-exilic period

00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:27.516
following is also known as the
Persian period,

00:17:27.516 --> 00:17:32.690
at first, but of course the
Persians won't rule for long.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.397
Alexander's going to come
marching through the Ancient

00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:36.265
Near East, so after the Persians
we'll have the Hellenistic

00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:38.278
Period.
But the period after the exile

00:17:38.278 --> 00:17:41.263
is referred to as the Persian
period, the period of the

00:17:41.263 --> 00:17:43.420
Restoration, the post-exilic
period.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.740
It's also called the Second
Temple Period because by about

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.420
520 they will have reconstructed
the temple;

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.920
so it's not inaccurate really
to refer to this time as the

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.930
Second Temple Period.
 

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.346
The second temple will stand
until 70, the year 70 of the

00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:57.970
Common Era.
So the period,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.409
of course, before the exile we
think of as the First Temple

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:03.960
Period (the temple is destroyed
in 586),

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.049
so the first temple period or
pre-exilic period.

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:10.948
Now, the books of First and
Second Chronicles provide a

00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:13.980
second account of the history of
Israel.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.221
Genesis all the way through 2
Kings has given us one long

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.673
account.
FirstChronicles actually begins

00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:22.936
with Adam and it does go
through--1 and 2 Chronicles do

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.930
go up to the Babylonian exile.
 

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:29.300
They echo a good deal of what
we find in the Books of Samuel

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.448
and Kings, but they have more of
a priestly bias and they

00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:38.041
eliminate a lot of material that
sheds a poor light on Israel's

00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:39.613
kings.
So, for example,

00:18:39.613 --> 00:18:42.089
you won't find the story of
David and Bathsheba when you're

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:44.480
reading the Chronicles account
of the reign of David.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.430
So Chronicles is already an
interpretation.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.460
It's an inner-biblical
interpretation.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.380
It is the Bible interpreting
itself.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.627
A later strand of tradition
reflecting on earlier strands of

00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:59.259
tradition and re-presenting that
material in a particular light.

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.143
The Chronicler is less
interested in David's political

00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:04.786
genius, for example;
it doesn't go into his strategy

00:19:04.786 --> 00:19:06.978
and his political
accomplishments nearly so much

00:19:06.978 --> 00:19:09.637
as it does go into his role in
establishing Jerusalem as a

00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:12.147
religious capital,
in planning a temple,

00:19:12.147 --> 00:19:15.160
in organizing the music for
temple worship.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.400
These are the interests of the
Chronicler.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.814
The Book of 2 Chronicles
concludes with the decree of

00:19:20.814 --> 00:19:24.426
Cyrus, permitting the Jewish
captives to return to their

00:19:24.426 --> 00:19:26.789
homeland and build their temple.
 

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:29.842
We have a second,
fuller version of this decree,

00:19:29.842 --> 00:19:32.635
which as I said,
seems to be consistent with

00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:35.623
what we know of Persian
policies--the policy of

00:19:35.623 --> 00:19:39.519
tolerating and even encouraging
local religious cults.

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.619
So that fuller version appears
in Ezra.

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:44.610
I'm going to read first from 2
Chronicles.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.611
2 Chronicles 36:22-23,
And in the first year of

00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:52.050
King Cyrus of Persia,
when the word of the Lord

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.960
spoken by Jeremiah was
fulfilled,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.189
the Lord roused the spirit of
King Cyrus of Persia to issue a

00:19:57.189 --> 00:20:00.204
proclamation throughout his
realm by word of mouth and in

00:20:00.204 --> 00:20:02.394
writing,
as follows: "Thus said King

00:20:02.394 --> 00:20:04.797
Cyrus of Persia:
The Lord God of Heaven has

00:20:04.797 --> 00:20:07.200
given me all the kingdoms of the
earth,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.822
and has charged me with
building Him a House in

00:20:09.822 --> 00:20:11.589
Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
 

00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:15.256
Any one of you of all of His
people, the Lord His God be with

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.551
him and let him go up.
Then in Ezra there is an

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.680
addition.
Ezra 1:3 and 4,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.155
…let Him go up to
Jerusalem that is in Judah,

00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:26.298
and build the House of the Lord
God of Israel,

00:20:26.298 --> 00:20:29.256
the God that is in Jerusalem;
and all who stay behind,

00:20:29.256 --> 00:20:32.318
wherever he may be living,
let the people of his place

00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:34.585
assist him with silver,
gold, goods,

00:20:34.585 --> 00:20:37.329
and livestock,
besides the freewill offering

00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:40.519
to the House of God that is in
Jerusalem.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:44.159
Notice that the decree at the
very beginning in Chronicles--in

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.620
the 2 Chronicles version--the
decree is said to fulfill the

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.589
word of the prophet Jeremiah.
 

00:20:49.589 --> 00:20:53.688
Now, you remember that Jeremiah
prophesied that the Babylonian

00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:56.495
exile would last 70 years;
he wrote a letter,

00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:59.065
he said settle down,
this is going to last a while,

00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:00.710
plant plants and build homes.
 

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.970
So he had prophesied 70 years
for an exile.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.359
Well, from the time of the
first departure of exiles in

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:12.829
597, maybe to the return in
538,61 years--it's close.

00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:15.919
If you look from the
destruction of the first temple

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:19.736
perhaps in 586 to the completion
of the second somewhere between

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:23.250
520,515, we're not really sure,
that's about 70 years.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.867
Either way, it seems that in
the eyes of the Chronicler it

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:26.740
was close enough.
 

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.795
This seems to have been a
fulfillment of Jeremiah's

00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:31.043
prediction.
That it would be about 70 years

00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:32.480
before they would return.
 

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.180
So the books of Ezra and
Nehemiah give an account of the

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.082
return of the Babylonian exiles
in the late sixth and fifth

00:21:40.082 --> 00:21:42.992
century.
And Ezra and Nehemiah were

00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:46.164
regarded as a unit;
those two books were regarded

00:21:46.164 --> 00:21:49.059
as a unit in the Hebrew Bible,
until the Middle Ages.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.730
They may in fact have formed
part of a larger historical

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.192
work;
Ezra, Nehemiah,

00:21:53.192 --> 00:21:54.690
1 and 2 Chronicles.
 

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.717
Ezra, and to a lesser degree,
Nehemiah seem to have a good

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:02.956
deal in common with Chronicles,
and therefore may derive from

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:05.740
the same author.
So sometimes in secondary

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.700
literature you will see
references to the Chronicler,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.683
which refers to the
hypothetical author of 1 and

00:22:11.683 --> 00:22:14.539
2Chronicles and Ezra and
possibly Nehemiah.

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:18.152
The chapters report the initial
return of the exiles,

00:22:18.152 --> 00:22:21.486
the rebuilding of the temple,
the career of Ezra,

00:22:21.486 --> 00:22:23.640
and the career of Nehemiah.
 

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.890
All four of the books were
probably edited in the late

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.527
fifth century BCE,
maybe close to the fourth

00:22:29.527 --> 00:22:32.777
century--that's our best
guess--when Judah was a small

00:22:32.777 --> 00:22:36.150
province still within the
massive Persian Empire.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.742
The books of Ezra and Nehemiah,
however, contain conflicting

00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:43.072
information about the return,
about the restoration,

00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:47.005
and as a result our knowledge
of the timing of various events

00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:50.225
is quite poor.
It's really not clear who

00:22:50.225 --> 00:22:55.445
returned first to help rebuild
Jerusalem, whether it was Ezra a

00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:58.140
priest, or Nehemiah a scribe.
 

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.051
He was a Persian--;:
not a scribe,

00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:01.210
he was a governor.
 

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.421
Ezra was a priest and scribe,
Nehemiah was a Persian

00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:06.309
appointed governor of Judah.
 

00:23:06.309 --> 00:23:09.766
And even though the Chronicler
dates events according to the

00:23:09.766 --> 00:23:12.109
year of the reign of the Persian
king,

00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:15.013
the king is Artaxerxes,
and unfortunately there are two

00:23:15.013 --> 00:23:18.293
kings named Artaxerxes in the
fifth century and there's one in

00:23:18.293 --> 00:23:20.726
the fourth,
so it's extremely difficult to

00:23:20.726 --> 00:23:22.839
figure out when these events
happened.

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:26.095
So keeping in mind that even
the experts cannot agree at all

00:23:26.095 --> 00:23:29.099
on the sequence of events,
we are simply going to look at

00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:31.240
the career of Ezra,
the career of Nehemiah.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.190
I'm not going to claim priority
for either of them.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.441
Because the events are not
presented in chronological

00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:39.760
order, even in the books,
I'm going to skip fairly freely

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.130
around, back and forth between
the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.695
So the Book of Ezra opens with
Cyrus' decree,

00:23:46.695 --> 00:23:49.435
which we've heard,
and then provides a long list

00:23:49.435 --> 00:23:52.350
of the exiles who returned to
Judah after 538.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:57.779
They're led by Sheshbazzar;
and then among the exiles he

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:02.119
says there was Yeshua who was a
priest and Zerubbavel.

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:07.281
Zerubbavel was a grandson of
King Jehoiakim who was the last

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:12.529
Davidic king who had been kept
in house arrest in Babylon.

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:16.791
He had been among the exiles in
597, he eventually had been

00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:19.730
released from house arrest in
Babylon,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.138
so now his grandson Zerubbavel,
a Davidide, was returning to

00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:26.489
Jerusalem, and you can imagine
that this would have stirred

00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:28.279
hope in the hearts of many.
 

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:32.494
Chapter 3 of Ezra describes the
sacrifices offered on a rebuilt

00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:36.232
altar and the beginning of the
process of rebuilding the

00:24:36.232 --> 00:24:39.890
temple,
probably around 521 or so:

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.439
When the builders had
laid the foundation of the

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:44.844
temple of the Lord,
priests in their vestments with

00:24:44.844 --> 00:24:47.284
trumpets,
and Levites sons of Asaph with

00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:50.369
cymbals were stationed to give
praise to the Lord,

00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:52.950
as King David of Israel had
ordained.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.682
They sang songs extolling and
praising the Lord,

00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:58.299
"For He is good,
His steadfast love for Israel

00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:00.761
is eternal."
All the people raised a great

00:25:00.761 --> 00:25:04.036
shout extolling the Lord because
the foundation of the House of

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:05.410
the Lord had been laid.
 

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.150
Many of the priests and Levites
and chiefs of the clans,

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.289
the old men who had seen the
first house [=the first temple],

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:14.720
wept loudly at the sight of the
founding of this house.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.920
Many others shouted joyously at
the top of their voices.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.713
The people could not
distinguish the shouts of joy

00:25:20.713 --> 00:25:23.773
from the people's weeping,
for the people raised a great

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:26.700
shout, the sound of which could
be heard from afar.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.677
So the older generations who
remember the magnificence of the

00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:33.130
first temple of Solomon shed
tears.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.962
The younger people are shouting
for joy at the establishment of

00:25:36.962 --> 00:25:39.332
a new temple.
But the building doesn't

00:25:39.332 --> 00:25:42.937
proceed smoothly and that's due
largely to the hostilities of

00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.799
the surrounding communities.
 

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.637
These surrounding communities
are referred to adversaries,

00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:49.430
adversaries of Judah and
Benjamin.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.503
In chapters 4,5,
and 6 these Samaritans in many

00:25:53.503 --> 00:25:58.640
cases, offer to assist in the
project of reconstruction.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.636
Their offer is rejected,
and as a result the Samaritans,

00:26:02.636 --> 00:26:06.849
insulted, persuade the Persians
that this is a bad idea.

00:26:06.849 --> 00:26:10.278
Rebuilding a potentially
rebellious city is a bad idea,

00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:14.088
and the Persians listen to them
and they order the rebuilding

00:26:14.088 --> 00:26:16.625
stopped.
There are two prophets then,

00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:18.020
Haggai and Zechariah.
 

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:23.470
 
 

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.069
So these are prophets now of
the post-exilic period.

00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:30.481
As we go through our
periodization of prophets you'll

00:26:30.481 --> 00:26:34.220
want to add this fourth
category, post-exilic prophets.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.200
They urge the continuation of
the building.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.657
A Persian official objects,
the Jews appeal to the new

00:26:41.657 --> 00:26:43.759
Persian Emperor Darius.
 

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:46.140
And they ask him to search
through the court records,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.520
look for the original
authorization by Cyrus--we have

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.940
been authorized to do this.
 

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.049
According to the text,
Cyrus' edict is found.

00:26:53.049 --> 00:26:56.355
Darius agrees not only to
enforce it, but to honor his

00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:59.349
obligation to supply money for
the rebuilding.

00:26:59.349 --> 00:27:02.728
This is under Persian imperial
sponsorship, and he will honor

00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:05.824
the obligation to supply money
for the rebuilding and to

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.569
procure sacrifices as well.
 

00:27:07.569 --> 00:27:10.582
The temple is finally
dedicated, we think,

00:27:10.582 --> 00:27:14.991
about 515 BCE and a Passover
celebration is celebrated in the

00:27:14.991 --> 00:27:18.339
sanctuary.
There are other social tensions

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:22.677
in the Restoration community,
specifically friction between

00:27:22.677 --> 00:27:27.315
those who had remained behind in
Judea during the exilic period

00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:31.695
and the returning exiles,
who although they were few in

00:27:31.695 --> 00:27:34.200
number, enjoyed imperial
support.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.747
These self-styled children of
the exile, they refer to

00:27:37.747 --> 00:27:41.830
themselves as sons of the exiled
or children of the exile they

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.779
refer to the local people--the
local Judeans--as "peoples of

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:48.882
the land."
This is a derogatory term that

00:27:48.882 --> 00:27:52.609
seems to cast aspersions on
their very status as Jews.

00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:54.950
They're like the other
nations or peoples of the land.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.071
They seem to be classifying
even Judeans in that category of

00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:01.246
"other."
As we will soon see,

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:05.749
some radically different views
of Jewish identity are going to

00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:07.890
emerge during this period.
 

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.721
So that's the initial
Restoration, the process by

00:28:10.721 --> 00:28:12.549
which the temple was rebuilt.
 

00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:15.505
Let's jump now to (we think)
somewhere in the mid-fifth

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:18.977
century perhaps.
Nehemiah--he's a Jewish subject

00:28:18.977 --> 00:28:23.871
of Persia--he's the official cup
bearer to the Persian Emperor

00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:26.680
Artaxerxes in the court at Susa.
 

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.765
This is a position that
probably entailed his being a

00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:32.390
eunuch.
The Book of Nehemiah opens with

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.750
a description of Nehemiah's
grief.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.026
He hears these reports of the
terrible conditions of his

00:28:38.026 --> 00:28:41.363
people in Jerusalem sometime
around the mid-fifth century

00:28:41.363 --> 00:28:43.487
and,
weeping, he asks for the

00:28:43.487 --> 00:28:47.606
consent of the emperor to go to
Jerusalem and to help rebuild

00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:49.709
the city.
So Nehemiah travels to

00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:52.908
Jerusalem, we think about 445
BCE, and he undertakes the

00:28:52.908 --> 00:28:54.770
refortifications of the city.
 

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.160
And he meets with opposition.
 

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.720
There's some internal
opposition.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.420
There's a female prophetess,
Noadiah, in Nehemiah 6:14,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.750
who seems to be opposed to
this.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.332
There's some external
opposition as well from Israel's

00:29:08.332 --> 00:29:11.036
neighbors: the Samaritans,
the Ammonites,

00:29:11.036 --> 00:29:14.357
some Arabs.
They resent this reconstruction

00:29:14.357 --> 00:29:19.046
and they see the reconstruction
of the city's defensive walls as

00:29:19.046 --> 00:29:21.280
an affront to Persian rule.
 

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.022
But Nehemiah continues;
he gives his workmen weapons so

00:29:25.022 --> 00:29:28.626
that they can protect themselves
against enemy attack and the

00:29:28.626 --> 00:29:31.869
walls around the city are
completed in record time.

00:29:31.869 --> 00:29:36.527
These refortifications help to
establish Jerusalem as an urban

00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:41.490
center, and eventually Nehemiah
is appointed governor of Judah,

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.980
under Persian domination.
 

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.894
The text says that he
institutes various reforms:

00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:49.019
economic reforms,
social reforms.

00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:52.522
He seems to be trying to
improve the situation of the

00:29:52.522 --> 00:29:54.880
poor, and establish public
order.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.371
We think that the governorship
of Nehemiah overlapped to some

00:29:58.371 --> 00:30:01.836
degree with the mission of Ezra,
and Ezra's activities are

00:30:01.836 --> 00:30:04.750
reported in both the books of
Ezra and Nehemiah.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.243
Some scholars believe that they
didn't overlap,

00:30:07.243 --> 00:30:09.900
that that's an illusion created
by our sources.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.329
But chapter 7 of the book of
Ezra introduces Ezra.

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:17.337
He's a Babylonian Jew,
he comes from a priestly

00:30:17.337 --> 00:30:21.457
family, but he's also described
as a scribe who is expert in the

00:30:21.457 --> 00:30:24.598
Torah of Moses.
In verse 10 of chapter 7 it's

00:30:24.598 --> 00:30:28.525
said that Ezra had dedicated
himself to study the teaching of

00:30:28.525 --> 00:30:32.584
the Lord so as to observe it and
to teach the laws and rules to

00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:36.215
Israel.
So Ezra is commissioned by the

00:30:36.215 --> 00:30:40.767
Persian Emperor in a letter,
the text of which is

00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:45.319
represented or reproduced in
chapter 7:12-26.

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:48.885
The Emperor commissions him to
travel to Jerusalem,

00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:53.281
to supervise the temple,
and to assess how well Mosaic

00:30:53.281 --> 00:30:58.190
standards are being implemented
in the Judean province.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.947
He's charged with appointing
scribes and judges to administer

00:31:01.947 --> 00:31:03.450
civil and moral order.
 

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.552
He has the backing of the
Persian empire to institute

00:31:06.552 --> 00:31:09.834
Mosaic Law as the standard and
norm for the community in

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:12.486
Jerusalem.
This is standard operating

00:31:12.486 --> 00:31:16.746
procedure for the Persians--to
find loyal subjects to regulate

00:31:16.746 --> 00:31:20.798
their own local cults according
to ancestral traditions and

00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:24.570
Ezra's work needs to be
understood in that light.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.389
Chapter 7::
"For you are commissioned

00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:29.889
by the king and his seven
advisors to regulate Judah and

00:31:29.889 --> 00:31:31.980
Jerusalem according to the law
of your God,

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.202
which is in your care,...And
you, Ezra, by the divine wisdom

00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:38.425
you possess, appoint magistrates
and judges to judge all the

00:31:38.425 --> 00:31:41.429
people of the province of Beyond
the River" [Cis-Jordan]

00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:44.160
[See Note 1]
"who know the laws of your God,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.210
and to teach those who do not
know them.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.929
Let anyone who does not obey
the law of your God and the law

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:50.819
of the king be punished with
dispatch,"

00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:52.633
[so he has powers of
enforcement]

00:31:52.633 --> 00:31:54.786
"whether by death,
corporal punishment,

00:31:54.786 --> 00:31:58.440
confiscation of possessions,
or imprisonment."

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.985
In addition,
Ezra is appointed to bring

00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:04.000
treasures of silver and gold to
the temple.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.565
The text says that Ezra brings
with him a copy of the Mosaic

00:32:07.565 --> 00:32:10.828
Torah in order to regulate and
unify Jewish life in the

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:14.500
Restoration community,
and together Ezra and Nehemiah

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.109
bring about a revival.
 

00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:19.619
Ezra's reforms are aimed at
strengthening the religious

00:32:19.619 --> 00:32:21.440
identity of the Judahites.
 

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.022
He wants to revitalize morale
and he also wants to prevent the

00:32:25.022 --> 00:32:28.310
decline of Mosaic standards and
to prevent the decline of

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.720
biblical monotheism.
 

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.021
His two most important acts are
the dissolution of foreign

00:32:34.021 --> 00:32:38.700
marriages (this is a first) and
his renewal of the covenant.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.267
I'll say a little bit first
about the dissolution of foreign

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:43.496
marriages.
Ezra is said to have been

00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:47.183
distressed when he arrived to
discover that many of the

00:32:47.183 --> 00:32:50.050
returned exiles had married
with, we think,

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.416
non-Israelite women.
 

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:54.592
It's not clear.
Sometimes "peoples of the land"

00:32:54.592 --> 00:32:57.570
might refer to Judeans who had
remained behind but who

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.650
themselves had perhaps become
lax,

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.873
in Ezra's eyes,
in their observance of Mosaic

00:33:01.873 --> 00:33:04.971
standards.
But they had married women who

00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:08.460
seemed to follow pagan practices
perhaps.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.099
Chapters 9 and 10 describe his
efforts to reverse this trend.

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:16.876
He begs God to forgive the
people for this violation of his

00:33:16.876 --> 00:33:19.220
law, and then at a great
assembly,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.950
he calls upon all the people to
divorce their foreign spouses.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.859
Now, this isn't in fact
Pentateuchal law plainly read.

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:30.900
The prohibition of marriage
with any foreigner is a great

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.147
innovation on Ezra's part,
and it's one that,

00:33:34.147 --> 00:33:37.352
as we shall see,
was not universally accepted at

00:33:37.352 --> 00:33:38.811
all.
The high incidence of

00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:41.288
intermarriage is perhaps
indicated by the fact that it

00:33:41.288 --> 00:33:44.139
took several months to identify
all those who had intermarried

00:33:44.139 --> 00:33:46.710
and to send away their spouses
and their children.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.485
Even priests were among those
who didn't view intermarriage

00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:53.089
per se as a violation of the
covenant.

00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:55.922
In the next two lectures we'll
see other perspectives on this

00:33:55.922 --> 00:33:58.329
question of integration of
foreign groups within the

00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:00.523
community.
So I raise it as an issue now:

00:34:00.523 --> 00:34:03.233
we're going to see many
different attitudes as we move

00:34:03.233 --> 00:34:05.329
through the last section of the
Bible.

00:34:05.329 --> 00:34:09.230
The text of Ezra's prayer
before God is a fascinating

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.829
presentation of Ezra's
interpretation of Israel's

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:16.571
history and prior texts,
and again, constitutes yet

00:34:16.571 --> 00:34:20.550
another response to the calamity
that had befallen the nation;

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.199
but also constitutes another
example of inner-biblical

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.750
interpretation:
later levels,

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.972
or layers within the biblical
text turning to older traditions

00:34:27.972 --> 00:34:30.730
and interpreting them,
or reinterpreting them.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.500
So listen to how Ezra
understands biblical tradition

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.269
and listen to how he interprets
Israel's history.

00:34:38.269 --> 00:34:41.414
This is from Ezra 9,
he's praying to God before the

00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:42.610
assembled people.
 

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.788
From the time of our
fathers to this very day we have

00:34:45.788 --> 00:34:46.940
been deep in guilt.
 

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.914
Because of our iniquities we,
our kings, and our priests have

00:34:49.914 --> 00:34:51.699
been handed over to foreign
kings,

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.062
to the sword,
to captivity,

00:34:53.062 --> 00:34:55.840
to pillage, and to humiliation,
as is now the case.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.965
But now, for a short while,
there has been a reprieve from

00:34:58.965 --> 00:35:01.543
the Lord our God,
who has granted us a surviving

00:35:01.543 --> 00:35:03.894
remnant...
remember the prophetic idea of

00:35:03.894 --> 00:35:05.150
a remnant that would survive?
 

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.000
...and given us a stake
in His Holy place;

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.884
our God has restored the luster
to our eyes and furnished us

00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:13.280
with a little sustenance in our
bondage… Now,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.944
what can we say in the face of
this, O our God,

00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:18.320
for we have forsaken Your
commandments,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.337
which You gave us through Your
servants, the prophets when You

00:35:21.337 --> 00:35:23.829
said,
here he's quoting the Bible;

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:26.182
'The land that you are
about to possess is a land

00:35:26.182 --> 00:35:28.840
unclean through the uncleanness
of the peoples of the land,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.342
through their abhorrent
practices with which they,

00:35:31.342 --> 00:35:33.794
in their impurity,
have filled it from one end to

00:35:33.794 --> 00:35:35.687
the other.
Now then, do not give your

00:35:35.687 --> 00:35:38.269
daughters in marriage to their
sons or let their daughters

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.526
marry your sons;
do nothing for their well being

00:35:40.526 --> 00:35:42.327
or advantage,
then you will be strong and

00:35:42.327 --> 00:35:45.029
enjoy the bounty of the land and
bequeath it to your children

00:35:45.029 --> 00:35:47.370
forever.'
So he's quoting earlier

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.141
tradition.
After all that has

00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:51.483
happened to us because of our
evil deeds and our deep

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:54.011
guilt--though You,
our God, have been forbearing,

00:35:54.011 --> 00:35:55.909
[punishing us]
less than our iniquity

00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:57.860
[deserves]
in that You have granted us

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.812
such a remnant as this-- shall
we once again violate Your

00:36:00.812 --> 00:36:03.817
commandments by intermarrying
with these people who follow

00:36:03.817 --> 00:36:05.610
such abhorrent practices?
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.304
Will You not rage against us
till we are destroyed without

00:36:09.304 --> 00:36:12.256
remnant or survivor?
So Ezra's argument is,

00:36:12.256 --> 00:36:14.426
first of all,
following the Deuteronomistic

00:36:14.426 --> 00:36:17.630
line.
History reflects God's judgment.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:22.041
Israel's tragic fate is because
of her sins, and indeed,

00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:25.409
she's been given a mercy and a
reprieve.

00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:28.170
She hasn't been punished as
fully as she deserves.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.882
He also follows the prophetic
line that this remnant has been

00:36:31.882 --> 00:36:33.429
saved and now restored.
 

00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:35.849
So the covenant hasn't been
completely abrogated.

00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:39.830
But notice his identification
of the sin for which Israel was

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.700
punished.
Israel has mixed--and this is

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.907
the language that he uses
elsewhere--Israel has mixed holy

00:36:46.907 --> 00:36:51.335
seed with common seed through
marital unions with the peoples

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:54.456
of the land,
meaning foreigners certainly,

00:36:54.456 --> 00:36:58.445
but possibly also some of these
Judeans who had remained in the

00:36:58.445 --> 00:37:02.370
land during the exile and who
seem to have adopted some of the

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.429
customs of their neighbors.
 

00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:07.020
And if history is any guide,
he's warning,

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.875
the community is placing itself
at great risk by intermarrying

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:14.667
again with those who will lead
them into the worship of other

00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:18.079
gods and the performance of
abhorrent practices.

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:20.744
Surely he says,
this time God will not be so

00:37:20.744 --> 00:37:23.100
merciful as to spare even a
remnant.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.480
So learn from history.
 

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.878
We sinned once by
intermarrying,

00:37:25.878 --> 00:37:28.090
that was the sin for which we
have been exiled.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.811
If we do the same thing again,
this time we will be punished

00:37:31.811 --> 00:37:33.829
without any hope of a remnant.
 

00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:39.011
So his interpretation of Mosaic
prescriptions about marriage is

00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:40.599
an expansive one.
 

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:43.882
The Torah does prohibit
intermarriage with the native

00:37:43.882 --> 00:37:46.469
Canaanites at the time of the
conquest,

00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:49.710
the rationale being that they
would lead Israelites into

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.809
abhorrent pagan practices,
child sacrifices, and so on.

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:57.149
But of course it's actually not
a completely--there is actually

00:37:57.149 --> 00:38:00.112
a legal provision for how to go
about marrying a captive

00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:02.393
Canaanite woman;
so it's not a completely

00:38:02.393 --> 00:38:04.349
unqualified prohibition to begin
with.

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:07.602
The Torah then also prohibits
intermarriage with certain,

00:38:07.602 --> 00:38:10.364
very specific foreigners,
Moabites and Ammonites,

00:38:10.364 --> 00:38:13.014
specifically because of their
cruel treatment of the

00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:16.340
Israelites during their trek
from Egypt to the Promised Land.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.380
Egyptians are prohibited only
to the third generation.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.347
But there's no prohibition
against marriage with other

00:38:22.347 --> 00:38:25.353
foreigners--a Phoenician,
an Arab--so long as they enter

00:38:25.353 --> 00:38:28.241
into the covenant of Yahweh,
as long as they don't lead the

00:38:28.241 --> 00:38:30.829
Israelite partner into the
worship of other gods.

00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:34.968
The rationale for intermarriage
prohibitions in the Pentateuch

00:38:34.968 --> 00:38:38.090
are always behavioral,
they're always moral.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.655
If this person will lead you
astray to abhorrent practices

00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:41.599
that is prohibited.
 

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:44.110
But marriage into the
group is not prohibited.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.019
Indeed, Israel's kings married
foreign women regularly.

00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:50.534
Many of the kings of Israel
were themselves offspring of

00:38:50.534 --> 00:38:51.540
these foreign women.
 

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.920
They were still fully Israelite.
 

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.769
Israelite identity passed
through the male line.

00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:59.732
But Ezra who is protective of
Israel's religious identity,

00:38:59.732 --> 00:39:03.261
is zealous for the Lord,
is wary of God's wrath--he's

00:39:03.261 --> 00:39:07.012
interpreting and promulgating
these prohibitions in such a way

00:39:07.012 --> 00:39:10.639
as to create a general ban on
intermarriage of any kind.

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:13.039
Israel mustn't make the same
mistake twice.

00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:16.606
Israelite identity is now made
contingent in Ezra's view on the

00:39:16.606 --> 00:39:19.079
status of both the mother and
the father.

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:22.118
One is only an Israelite if one
has both an Israelite mother and

00:39:22.118 --> 00:39:23.180
an Israelite father.
 

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.119
Both must be of the "holy seed."
 

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:29.639
This is a phrase which is being
coined now in Ezra's time and is

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:33.800
now serving as a rationale for
the ban on intermarriage.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.571
It's not that a person is
prohibited because they will

00:39:36.571 --> 00:39:39.030
lead you astray to the worship
of other gods.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.825
That's something that can be
corrected if the person in fact

00:39:41.825 --> 00:39:44.099
enters into the religious
community of Israel.

00:39:44.099 --> 00:39:46.647
The rationale is that they just
simply are not of holy seed and

00:39:46.647 --> 00:39:48.659
there's nothing that you can do
to change that,

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:51.539
so this becomes a permanent and
universal ban.

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:54.798
So that's the first very
important thing that Ezra tries

00:39:54.798 --> 00:39:57.997
to do: the dissolution of
marriage with foreign spouses

00:39:57.997 --> 00:40:01.670
and to establish a blanket
universal ban on intermarriage,

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.510
to make Israelite identity
dependent on the native

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.119
Israelite status of both mother
and father.

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:10.429
His second deed is the renewal
of the Mosaic Covenant.

00:40:10.429 --> 00:40:12.969
This act is reported in
Nehemiah 8.

00:40:12.969 --> 00:40:15.946
There's an extended public
reading of the Torah of Moses

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:19.409
and that's followed then by a
renewal of the Mosaic Covenant:

00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:21.782
When the seventh month
arrived--the Israelites being

00:40:21.782 --> 00:40:23.239
[settled]
in their towns--the entire

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:25.612
people assembled as one man in
the square before the Water

00:40:25.612 --> 00:40:27.585
Gate,
and they asked Ezra the scribe

00:40:27.585 --> 00:40:30.515
to bring the scroll of the
Teaching of Moses with which the

00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:31.880
Lord had charged Israel.
 

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.838
On the first day of the seventh
month, Ezra the priest brought

00:40:34.838 --> 00:40:36.730
the Teaching before the
congregation,

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.309
men and women and all who could
listen with understanding.

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:41.560
He read from it,
facing the square before the

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.861
Water Gate, from the first light
until midday,

00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:46.929
to the men and the women and
those who could understand;

00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:50.819
the ears of all the people were
given to the scroll of the

00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:53.739
Teaching.
Ezra the scribe stood upon a

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:57.322
wooden tower made for the
purpose…Ezra opened the scroll

00:40:57.322 --> 00:41:00.840
in the sight of all the people,
for he was above all the people;

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.869
as he opened it,
all the people stood up.

00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:05.095
Ezra blessed the Lord,
the great God and all the

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:06.610
people answered,
"Amen, Amen,"

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.470
with hands upraised… and the
Levites explained the Teaching

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.859
to the people,
while the people stood in their

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:14.535
places.
They read from the scroll of

00:41:14.535 --> 00:41:16.854
the teaching of God,
translating it and giving the

00:41:16.854 --> 00:41:19.239
sense;
so they understood the reading.

00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:22.220
Apparently the assembled people
no longer understood the

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.579
classical Hebrew of the Bible,
if it was formulated in that.

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:27.900
What he was actually--what is
this scroll?

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.375
This is the first time now that
we're hearing about the Torah as

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:31.789
a scroll and being read to
people.

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:34.860
So this is historically quite
fascinating.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.599
But the people don't seem to be
able to understand it.

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:40.688
Ezra and his assistants are
probably translating it into

00:41:40.688 --> 00:41:43.552
Aramaic which is now the
lingua franca of the

00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:46.280
Persian Empire,
giving the sense of the text

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.940
perhaps as it's being read.
 

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.607
We really can't be certain what
it is that Ezra was presenting

00:41:51.607 --> 00:41:53.050
as the Torah of Moses.
 

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.236
It may have been the Pentateuch
basically in the form that we

00:41:56.236 --> 00:41:59.545
now have it.
Both D and P are very strongly

00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:01.170
reflected in Ezra.
 

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.968
He quotes from them,
he refers to them,

00:42:02.968 --> 00:42:05.713
and then interprets and applies
them in new and interesting

00:42:05.713 --> 00:42:06.980
ways.
In any event,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.729
this Torah was to become the
basis and the standard--with a

00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:14.413
lot of good heavy Persian
imperial support--for the Jewish

00:42:14.413 --> 00:42:16.869
community from that time
forward.

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:20.207
And at a festival celebration a
few weeks later there was an

00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:23.205
additional public teaching of
the law and a recital of

00:42:23.205 --> 00:42:26.372
Israel's history that once again
laid special emphasis on

00:42:26.372 --> 00:42:30.110
Israel's obligations,
what she owed to Yahweh.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.689
The recitation of that history
is found in Nehemiah 9,

00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:37.674
and again as an interpretation
of the calamities that Israel

00:42:37.674 --> 00:42:40.271
had faced;
it's consistent with the

00:42:40.271 --> 00:42:42.750
earlier prayer of Ezra that I
read.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.913
God has withheld nothing from
Israel, yet Israel has defied

00:42:45.913 --> 00:42:48.738
God, rebelled against Him,
killed the prophets who had

00:42:48.738 --> 00:42:50.710
urged them to turn back to the
covenant;

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.443
and God tolerated Israel's sin
as long as he possibly could but

00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:56.309
finally he had to punish her.
 

00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:59.066
But even so,
in His great compassion God

00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:01.539
didn't abandon Israel
completely.

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:04.843
Verse 33 of this prayer then
turns and addresses God,

00:43:04.843 --> 00:43:08.400
"Surely you are in the right
with respect to all that has

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.945
come upon us,
for You have acted faithfully

00:43:10.945 --> 00:43:12.260
and we have been wicked."
 

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.165
So again, this justification of
God and blaming of the

00:43:15.165 --> 00:43:18.179
Israelites for all that has
befallen them and learning a

00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.030
lesson for that in the
future--no intermarriage.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.655
All of this is but a prelude
then to the people's

00:43:24.655 --> 00:43:28.809
reaffirmation and renewed
commitment to the covenant,

00:43:28.809 --> 00:43:32.300
and it's spelled out in great
detail in Nehemiah 10.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.804
Chapter 10 opens,
"In view of all this,

00:43:34.804 --> 00:43:37.769
we make this pledge and put it
in writing,"

00:43:37.769 --> 00:43:41.159
and then there follows a list
of all the officials:

00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:42.990
the Levites,
the priests,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.260
the heads of the people.
 

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.900
And it says that all of these
officials and leaders in

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.341
conjunction join with the
people, verse 30 and 31,

00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:51.369
they:
… join with their noble

00:43:51.369 --> 00:43:54.476
brothers, and take an oath with
sanctions to follow the Teaching

00:43:54.476 --> 00:43:56.395
of God,
given through Moses the servant

00:43:56.395 --> 00:43:59.338
of God, and to observe carefully
all the commandments of the Lord

00:43:59.338 --> 00:44:01.210
our Lord,
His rules and laws.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.278
Namely: We will not give our
daughters in marriage to the

00:44:04.278 --> 00:44:07.018
peoples of the land or take
their daughters for our

00:44:07.018 --> 00:44:09.606
sons.
So we then read the various

00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:13.400
obligations that the people are
committing themselves to,

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.007
and these include observance of
the Sabbath day and the Sabbath

00:44:17.007 --> 00:44:20.440
year as well as supplying the
needs of and the upkeep of the

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.574
temple.
But it's surely significant

00:44:22.574 --> 00:44:25.561
that the ban on intermarriage
and the observance of the

00:44:25.561 --> 00:44:26.889
Sabbath top the list.
 

00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:29.954
We are going to commit
ourselves again to God's

00:44:29.954 --> 00:44:33.372
teaching, his rules and laws;
namely: we won't intermarry and

00:44:33.372 --> 00:44:34.550
we'll observe the Sabbath!
 

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.817
So these are singled out at the
top of the list,

00:44:37.817 --> 00:44:40.320
as central covenantal
obligations.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.504
Chapter 13 describes Nehemiah's
efforts to see that the people

00:44:44.504 --> 00:44:46.219
live up to this pledge.
 

00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:49.300
And he scurries around
Jerusalem--he's enforcing the

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.200
cessation of work on the
Sabbath, he's persuading

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.039
individuals to give up their
foreign wives.

00:44:55.039 --> 00:44:58.345
Ezra and Nehemiah were zealous
in their promotion of the

00:44:58.345 --> 00:45:00.630
renewed covenant,
and in their view,

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.947
the centerpiece of the covenant
was the ban on intermarriage and

00:45:04.947 --> 00:45:07.139
the observance of the Sabbath.
 

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:09.150
It is interesting that these
two phenomena,

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.640
in addition to circumcision,
will emerge as the three

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.657
identifying features of a Jew in
the ancient world when you look

00:45:14.657 --> 00:45:17.530
at external literature:
they are a circumcised people,

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.782
there's one day of the week
that they don't work,

00:45:19.782 --> 00:45:21.800
and they don't marry outside
their group.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.602
Those are the kinds of themes
that you start to see in

00:45:24.602 --> 00:45:27.828
writings of ancient Greeks and
so on when they talk about this

00:45:27.828 --> 00:45:30.482
people.
Ezra and Nehemiah's reforms can

00:45:30.482 --> 00:45:34.760
be seen as a direct response to
the events of Israel's history.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.451
What's happened before just
cannot be allowed to happen

00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:39.583
again.
And they view the tragic

00:45:39.583 --> 00:45:41.750
history as a cautionary tale.
 

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.489
It's calling upon the people to
make the necessary changes to

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:47.110
avoid a repeat disaster.
 

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.272
There's only one way to
guarantee that Israel will never

00:45:50.272 --> 00:45:51.480
again be destroyed.
 

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.447
She has to live up to the
covenant she failed to honor in

00:45:54.447 --> 00:45:56.754
the past.
She has to rededicate herself

00:45:56.754 --> 00:46:00.262
to the covenant and this time
she has to be single-minded in

00:46:00.262 --> 00:46:03.369
her devotion to God,
because history has shown that

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:05.920
God will punish faithlessness
and betrayal.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.085
Israel can't be led astray by
the beliefs and practices of her

00:46:10.085 --> 00:46:13.908
neighbors, and so a strict
policy of separation has to be

00:46:13.908 --> 00:46:17.937
enforced if Israel's going to
finally be cured of the desire

00:46:17.937 --> 00:46:20.938
for idols.
Again, it's interesting that in

00:46:20.938 --> 00:46:24.633
Jewish tradition--the Jewish
tradition is that the flirtation

00:46:24.633 --> 00:46:27.290
with idolatry,
which had plagued Israel in the

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.836
First Temple Period,
ceased to exist in the Second

00:46:29.836 --> 00:46:32.455
Temple Period.
So again, this is another area

00:46:32.455 --> 00:46:35.347
in which Jews earned for
themselves a reputation in

00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:37.328
antiquity.
They have a reputation for

00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:39.833
their strict monotheism,
their scrupulous avoidance of

00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:41.688
foreign gods.
They will not bow down to

00:46:41.688 --> 00:46:43.117
another god.
There is this people that

00:46:43.117 --> 00:46:44.833
doesn't intermarry,
they don't work one day a week,

00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:46.789
and they won't bow down to our
kings or to other gods;

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:49.829
these are the kinds of things
you find in writings in this

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:51.825
period.
So Ezra and Nehemiah,

00:46:51.825 --> 00:46:55.793
backed by Persian imperial
authority, help to create and

00:46:55.793 --> 00:46:59.039
preserve--not just
preserve--create and

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:01.400
preserve,
a national and religious

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.650
identity for Jews at a
precarious time.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.559
Their reforms were not
universally welcomed.

00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:11.040
Already, even in the books of
Ezra and Nehemiah which give a

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.930
very sympathetic account of
their work, obviously,

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.289
we can see rumblings and
discontent.

00:47:16.289 --> 00:47:20.294
There are other works that are
going to express opposition to

00:47:20.294 --> 00:47:22.829
the separatism of Ezra and
Nehemiah.

00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:25.278
Isaiah 56:1-7,
an interesting passage,

00:47:25.278 --> 00:47:29.050
it states quite explicitly that
foreigners who have joined

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.300
themselves to God are welcome.
 

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.659
They are welcome in the temple;
they are welcome even to

00:47:33.659 --> 00:47:34.780
minister before God.
 

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.318
There is a good deal of
historical evidence for the

00:47:37.318 --> 00:47:40.009
assimilation of foreigners
within the Jewish community

00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:41.329
going on all the time.
 

00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:43.579
Non-Jews became Jews,
they married Jews.

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:45.710
We know of one family,
the Tobiad family,

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:48.960
quite influential--they were
originally an Ammonite family.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.609
Now, that is a group that is
explicitly prohibited from

00:47:51.609 --> 00:47:53.719
entering the congregation in
Deuteronomy!

00:47:53.719 --> 00:47:56.311
But this is a family that
adopted Jewish identity,

00:47:56.311 --> 00:47:57.739
became fully assimilated.
 

00:47:57.739 --> 00:48:02.133
So clearly there's great
difference of opinion on this

00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:04.348
matter.
In the last two lectures we're

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:07.236
going to be focusing a lot on
the diversity of approaches to

00:48:07.236 --> 00:48:09.880
the whole question of Israelite
or Jewish identity,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.400
and the relationship to the
Gentile world.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.907
So, although under Ezra,
the Torah became the official

00:48:16.907 --> 00:48:19.969
and authoritative norm for
Israel,

00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:23.427
although under Ezra Judaism
took the decisive step towards

00:48:23.427 --> 00:48:25.550
becoming a religion of
Scripture,

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.219
based on the scriptural text.
 

00:48:27.219 --> 00:48:31.902
This did not in itself result
in a single uniform set of

00:48:31.902 --> 00:48:33.860
practices or beliefs.
 

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.543
Adopting the Torah as a
communal norm simply meant that

00:48:37.543 --> 00:48:41.090
practices and beliefs were
deemed to be authentic,

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.931
to the degree that they
accorded with the sense of

00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:47.699
Scripture--and interpretation of
Scripture varied dramatically.

00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:51.025
So that widely divergent groups
now, in the Persian period and

00:48:51.025 --> 00:48:53.260
as we move into the Hellenistic
period,

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.930
widely divergent groups will
claim biblical warrant for their

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.949
specific practices and beliefs.
 

00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:01.564
So in short,
Ezra may have unified Israel

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:04.962
around a common text,
but he didn't unify them around

00:49:04.962 --> 00:49:08.099
a common interpretation
of that text.

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:11.215
Alright, when we come back
we'll be looking at about four

00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:14.608
more books, all of which set up
very interesting and different

00:49:14.608 --> 00:49:17.000
views on some of these basic
questions.

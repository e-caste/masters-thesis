00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.842
Prof: So the rules of
quantum mechanics are going to

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:06.510
be stated for one last time.
 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.646
Now we're using the fact that
you've heard them over and over,

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.630
it's going to be more compact
than before.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.170
So it's really the form of many
postulates, because it's a

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.530
theory which is based on
experiment;

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.280
it's not deduced by mathematics.
 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.840
You make up some postulates
that condense all the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.960
experimental facts.
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.773
There are new mathematical
results you will need,

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.180
but they are separate.
 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.580
They are deducible
mathematically.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.110
They are not part of the
physics postulates.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.288
The first postulate--by the
way, this is the postulate for

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:40.560
Physics 201.
 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.721
If you know more mathematics
and so on, there's another way

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.584
to write the postulate,
but we're not interested in

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:44.920
that.
 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.350
We just want the rules for this
class,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.050
and I don't even care how much
of this you carry in your head,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.190
but I want you to know that in
principle,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.410
every problem I gave you,
every question I asked,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.450
can be answered just by turning
to these postulates,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.219
so you should know what they
are.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.700
So the first postulate is that
every particle--

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.078
this is for 1 dimension,
1 particle only--

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.950
is given by a certain wave
function,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.545
Y(x),
that contains all the possible

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:16.819
information on that particle.
 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.292
This is the analog of x
and p in classical

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:21.049
mechanics.
 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.677
And we always choose Y
so that Y^(2)dx is

00:01:26.677 --> 00:01:30.220
normalized to 1 in all of space.
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.980
That is a convention;
it's not required.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.961
If you take a Y and you
multiply it by a number,

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.170
it stands for the same physical
state.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.196
So you pick the number so that
the squared integral of Y

00:01:42.196 --> 00:01:42.959
is 1.
 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:52.190
The second thing is,
a state of definite momentum.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.535
In other words,
is there a wave function that

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:57.893
describes a particle guaranteed
to have a definite momentum when

00:01:57.893 --> 00:01:58.800
I measure it?
 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.739
The answer is yes.
 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.890
That function is denoted by
Y _p(x).

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.280
It is not an arbitrary function.
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.080
This Y is whatever you
like.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.425
This is a particular Y
which assures you that if you

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:15.080
measure my momentum when I'm in
this state,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.747
you will get the value
p, and it looks like this -

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:23.914
e^(ipx/ℏ)
divided by square root of

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:28.500
the length of that universe in
which you're living.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.710
That's the second way to define
this function.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.609
Either I can say this is the
answer, or I can give you a

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.580
little way to find this function
in an equivalent way.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.958
The equivalent way says states
of definite momentum obey the

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.940
following equation.
 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.756
If you solve this equation,
the function you get is in fact

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.729
Y_p.
 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.740
So Y_p
can be defined either way,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.246
either by saying,
solve this equation and then

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.310
the function you get is
Y_p,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.128
but you can easily verify that
this function in fact is a

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:09.038
solution to that equation.
 

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.561
Now there's a new piece of
mathematics that's not connected

00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:13.289
with this.
 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:14.460
This is a postulate.
 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.128
Mathematics says,
if you live on a ring,

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:20.681
you go around in a circle,
and the x goes to x

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.473
 L,
you've got to come back to the

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:24.318
same function.
 

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:28.471
That quantizes p, I have
the value as (2ph/L)

00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.009
times m,
where m is an integral.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.120
Let me call it n.
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 m is the particle mass.
 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.169
That is a mathematical
deduction.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.069
You don't have to make that a
postulate.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.060
That's the postulate;
that's a deduction.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.372
Second postulate says--or third
postulate--a state of definite

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:58.870
position, x_0.
 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.381
Namely, if you want to describe
a particle which is guaranteed

00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.949
to be at x_0,
what function describes that.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.586
I'm going to give the function
the name Y_

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:10.580
X0.
 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.182
You have to be very clear on
what this x_0

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:14.620
is and what x is,
okay?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.199
This p is a label that
says something about the wave

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.879
function.
 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.264
This is a function of x,
so x varies from - to

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:21.709
infinity.
 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.490
This is a label for the state.
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.680
What's special about this state?
 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.129
It's got a momentum p.
What's special about this state?

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.620
It's got a definite location
x_0.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.189
What is the function?
 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.420
I think you should know by now
what the function looks like.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.470
Anybody know?
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.019
State of definite
x_0?

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:44.470
Any guess?
 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.230
Yes?
 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.410
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.470
Prof: Yes,
so I'm going to make it a

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.899
little simpler.
 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:51.112
It's the function,
I'm just going to call it big

00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:53.300
spike at x_0.
 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.940
Now big spike at
x_0 is a little

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.387
vague and deliberately left so,
because this spike has a little

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:04.629
bit of non 0 value away from
x_0.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.918
And you can make it narrower
and narrower and taller and

00:05:06.918 --> 00:05:08.706
taller and that's what has a
technical name,

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:10.079
but I don't want to go there.
 

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.745
Let's imagine we can only
measure position to one part in

00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:16.579
10 to the 97 meters.
 

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:17.579
Yes?
 

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:18.920
Student:  Is it the
Dirac delta function?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.221
Prof: This one is not,
but eventually it will become

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:21.500
that.
 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.120
But I just want to keep it like
this.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.269
But instead of saying it's a
spike, I can also say it obeys

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:30.060
the following equation.
 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.178
 x Y_x0
(x) =

00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:36.225
x_0 times same
function(ie

00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:39.490
Y_x0
(x)).

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
So let me take a minute to
discuss both these equations.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.846
They are very special
mathematical forms,

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:48.206
and this is just for your
own--you don't have to know this

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:49.089
part of it.
 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.660
This will do for this course.
 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.410
If you want to know the whole
story--

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.057
see, normally,
when you take a function

00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:59.093
Y(x),
and you differentiate it,

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:01.430
you will get a new function,
right?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.810
Take a sine,
you'll get a cosine.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.649
If you take x^(2),
you will get 2x.

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.029
So the act of taking
derivatives usually gives you a

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.879
brand new function,
a different function.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.891
This one says,
except for those constants here

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:18.639
and here, if you take the
derivative, it should look like

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.050
a multiple of the same function.
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.180
Obviously, that's a very
special function.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.762
You're saying upon
differentiating,

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:27.160
it's going to look the same.
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.255
Well, not every function has a
property, but we all know one

00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:32.459
function does,
the exponential function.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.214
Similarly, if you took a
function, any function Y

00:06:35.214 --> 00:06:38.168
(x) and multiplied it by
x, you will get a new

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:39.170
function, right?
 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.680
Cos x will become x
times cos x.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.560
Sine x will become x
times sine x.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.350
e^(x )will become x
times e^(x).

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.620
It becomes a completely new
function.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.791
But I am demanding that for
this magical function,

00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.416
when I multiply by x,
it is essentially a constant

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.230
times the same function.
 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.550
You've got to ask yourself,
how can I take a function,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.439
f(x), multiply it by x
everywhere and it looks the

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.220
same except for multiplicative
factor.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.899
It looks impossible.
 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:11.250
But the spike is in fact such a
function.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.069
Let us see why.
 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.925
If we take a random function,
if you multiply it by x,

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:19.204
which looks like this,
it will get taller and taller

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:20.939
as you go to the right.
 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.377
But suppose the function in
question is a spike at

00:07:25.377 --> 00:07:27.459
x_0.
 

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:30.684
If you multiply it by x,
you're basically multiplying

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:33.853
only by x_0,
because it has a life only of

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.220
x_0.
 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.509
It doesn't exist anywhere else.
 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.017
The only place it's even
non-zero is at the point

00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:40.220
x_0.
 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.329
So there's no difference
between multiplying it by

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.699
x, and multiplying it by
x_0.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.180
Multiplying by x all
over here is a waste,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.940
because the function is 0
there.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.949
That's why for that spike
function, this is actually true.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:54.420
You see that?
 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.410
It's the second way that
characterizes it.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.709
So again it says multiplying
by x is generally an

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.889
operation that changes the
nature of the function,

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:07.064
but there are special functions
for whom the effect is to simply

00:08:07.064 --> 00:08:08.829
rescale the function by a
number.

00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:09.980
Find me that function.
 

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.175
That's the state of definite
x_0,

00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:15.850
and the only answer to that is
a spike.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.372
So we have the option of simply
accepting the left hand side as

00:08:19.372 --> 00:08:22.610
postulate 2 and postulate 3,
but there are equivalent ways

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.519
to say this.
 

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.353
And I will tell you in a minute
why I'm saying this,

00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:31.488
because you can ask the
following question - what is the

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:33.668
state of definite energy?
 

00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:39.604
The state of definite energy,
I'm going to write it this way

00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:44.532
in the right hand side,
is also a solution to some

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:45.840
equation.
 

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.899
That equation is −(
â„ ^(2)

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.960
/2m)(d^(2)
Y_E/dx ^(2))

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.690
V(x)Y_E
(x) =

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.980
EY_E
(x).

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.429
But I'm trying to tell you that
I'm not going to elevate this to

00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:12.402
a postulate,
because I think one of you

00:09:12.402 --> 00:09:16.889
noticed already something very
familiar about this equation.

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:21.203
Because, you see,
in classical mechanics,

00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:25.734
energy is given by
(p^(2)/2m)

00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:27.460
V(x).
 

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.759
Do you see that on the left
hand side,

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:34.610
except for the function
Y, I have what here looks

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.758
like ½m
x(-iℏd

00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:43.120
/dx)^(2)
VY.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.620
That's the left-hand side.
 

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.428
So that once you know states of
definite p and states of

00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:53.009
definite x obey these
equations,

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.783
states of definite anything
else, any function of x

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:58.190
and p, obeys a
similar equation,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.690
but every p is replaced
by −iâ„ 

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.673
d/dx,
and every x is just

00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:05.649
simply left as an x.
 

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:10.058
So this energy formula does not
require a new axiom,

00:10:10.058 --> 00:10:11.769
but if you didn't follow this
logic,

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:15.009
you can simply say I have one
more postulate,

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.149
which is that if I have states
of definite energy,

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.950
I must solve that equation.
 

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.467
But then you will need more and
more postulates,

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:25.414
because you've got zillions of
possible variables you're

00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:26.379
interested in.
 

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:28.952
What if somebody wants to know,
what is x^(2)

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:29.710
p^(2)?
 

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.490
That's a variable in classical
mechanics.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.629
But I'm not going to write
another postulate for that,

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:35.950
because if you wanted
x^(2)  p^(2),

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.288
states of definite x^(2)
p^(2),

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:42.743
it will obey the equation
((-iℏ)^(2)

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:48.129
d^(2)/dx^(2)) x Y
= some constant,

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:50.269
whatever it is, times Y.
 

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:53.995
Namely, p is going to be
replaced by the square of this

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:54.788
derivative.
 

00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:58.279
Square of a derivative means do
it twice.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:01.691
So there's a universal rule for
finding states of definite

00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:02.350
anything.
 

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.658
Let g be a
general variable in

00:11:04.658 --> 00:11:05.840
classical mechanics.
 

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.615
In quantum theory,
states of definite g

00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:12.008
satisfy the equation where you
first write the classical

00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:13.548
formula for g.
 

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.850
Maybe g is x^(2)
p^(2).

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.908
Replace x simply by
x;

00:11:17.908 --> 00:11:21.260
replace p by
-iℏd/dx

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.091
and let that multiply as a
function or differentiate some

00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:29.589
function,
and that will be a state of

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:32.080
definite g.
 

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.019
So I'm just giving you two ways
to do this postulate.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:42.577
Either you can say states of
definite energy are solutions to

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:46.486
the following equation,
that's HY= E

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:48.466
Y,
and that's what I've been doing

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.514
so far,
because I didn't mind in this

00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:53.048
class to introduce it as one
more postulate.

00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:55.580
If you're looking further
ahead, you should realize that

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.649
it is really not an independent
postulate,

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:00.341
that once you know what happens
to x and once you know

00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:02.942
happens to p, you can
predict what the equation will

00:12:02.942 --> 00:12:05.546
be for any function of x
and p. So if you see

00:12:05.546 --> 00:12:07.519
that analogy and it's helpful to
you,

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.778
you're welcome to the right
hand side of the board.

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:13.364
If you find it complicated,
add on to your list of things

00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:15.220
to remember one more thing.
 

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.871
If you want a state of definite
energy, you've got to solve this

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:19.509
equation.
 

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:24.950
Okay, now we come to another
postulate, postulate 4.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.179
Is that right?
 

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:30.190
Postulate 4.
 

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.966
If Y(x) is
written as a Σ_g

00:12:34.966 --> 00:12:39.384
A_g
Y_g(x)

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.808
where g could be
p,

00:12:42.808 --> 00:12:45.320
g could be E,
g could be position,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.894
whatever you like,
then the probability that you

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.203
will get a value g is
simply

00:12:53.203 --> 00:12:59.186
|A_g|^(2),
and A_g is

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:04.249
given by ∫Y_g
'(x)Y

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:06.158
(x)dx.
 

00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:10.008
Perhaps you can see now,
if I put g = p,

00:13:10.008 --> 00:13:13.639
this is what I call
|A_p|^(2),

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:17.178
and this will be e^(ipx
)etc.

00:13:17.178 --> 00:13:19.250
If I put g = energy,
this will be

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.168
A_E,
this will be Y'E.

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.059
Whatever variable you want,
you do these integrals and

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:26.970
you get the
probabilities.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.750
Then there's another postulate,
postulate 5.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:44.649
Postulate 5 says if g is
measured and you get one value,

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:48.950
say g_10--this
is a postulate,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.980
you don't have to write
g_10.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.543
You can say one particular
value--then the

00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:55.981
Σ_g
A_g

00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:59.860
Y_g
collapses to one term,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.759
just
Y_g0.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.951
g_0 is a
particular value of g,

00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:07.062
namely the third value,
the fourth value or the ninth

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:07.470
value.
 

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.899
This says the state collapses.
 

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:12.682
So originally,
you have a state,

00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:15.567
a general one,
which is potentially capable of

00:14:15.567 --> 00:14:19.139
giving any possible answer
that's contained in this sum,

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:21.062
with the probability
proportional to the square of

00:14:21.062 --> 00:14:21.769
the coefficient.
 

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:24.022
But once you made a measurement
and you got a particular

00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:26.028
answer g, call it
g_0,

00:14:26.028 --> 00:14:28.658
all the terms of the sum
disappear except the one term,

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:30.928
corresponding to the one answer
you got.

00:14:30.928 --> 00:14:32.950
That's a new property of
quantum mechanics,

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.450
that the act of measurement
changes the state from being

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.950
able to do many things to being
able to do one thing.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.587
The one thing could be
g, if you measure g.

00:14:42.587 --> 00:14:44.038
Namely,
it can be momentum,

00:14:44.038 --> 00:14:45.956
it can be energy,
it can be position,

00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:48.523
but you've got to be very
careful that if you measure

00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:50.990
momentum and got a state of
definite momentum,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.707
then you go and measure
position and got a state of

00:14:53.707 --> 00:14:55.900
definite position,
and you go back and measure

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.720
momentum,
you won't get the same answer.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.145
States of definite momentum
don't know what the position is,

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:03.860
and states of definite position
don't know what the momentum is.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.720
You will never be able to get
them both.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.330
You've got to pick one or the
other.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.953
By the way, I want to point out
to you one postulate seems to be

00:15:13.953 --> 00:15:17.614
somewhat missing,
the oldest thing we ever

00:15:17.614 --> 00:15:20.559
learned in this class,
right?

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.500
Why didn't I mention that?
 

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.070
That's actually contained here.
 

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.788
It's contained here because if
I say what's the probability

00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:29.269
that x has a value
x_0,

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:31.894
I will take integral
Y(x_0

00:15:31.894 --> 00:15:34.789
)'Y(x)
dx.

00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:36.259
Look at what this is.
 

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:38.761
Y(x_0)'
is a spike at

00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:40.070
x_0.
 

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.110
Y(x) is some
function.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.283
But the only place where the
products survives is near

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:46.658
x_0.
 

00:15:46.658 --> 00:15:49.792
Everywhere else is 0,
so the only place that integral

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.503
receives a contribution is
when x is at

00:15:52.503 --> 00:15:54.009
x_0.
 

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:56.837
So up to some constant
proportional to area of this

00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:59.327
spike, the answer is
proportional to the wave

00:15:59.327 --> 00:16:01.418
function at
x_0.

00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:04.975
Therefore--I'm sorry,
I mean to say square this,

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:09.590
and that is what I've been
saying is the rule for position.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.386
So again, for position you can
write a separate postulate,

00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:15.649
but it's not.
 

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:20.615
The postulate that I gave you
here, if you put g =

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:25.850
position, will give you the same
answer, namely this one.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.140
Again, if you don't want to get
into too many details,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.389
I would say the following is
what you should know.

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:32.470
You want a stated definite
momentum,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.330
or the probability for definite
momentum,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.650
take the integral with
Y_p

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.980
. For energy,
take Y_E.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.139
For definite position,
forget all integrals.

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:44.302
Just take Y at the
point x and then square

00:16:44.302 --> 00:16:44.590
it.
 

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.104
What I'm telling you is taking
Y at the point x

00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:49.932
and squaring it is what you
will do if you took the integral

00:16:49.932 --> 00:16:52.067
of Y with a spike,
which will filter out,

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.498
if you like,
Y at only the one point

00:16:53.498 --> 00:16:54.178
x_0.
 

00:16:54.178 --> 00:16:56.624
And if you square it,
you will get Y

00:16:56.624 --> 00:16:58.490
(x_0).
 

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:04.228
And the last postulate,
all-important postulate 6,

00:17:04.228 --> 00:17:10.435
says that the state changes
with time according to the

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:13.950
Schrödinger equation.
 

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.048
I'm just going to call it
HY,

00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:18.980
but from now on,
it will be -d^(2)

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.979
Y/dx^(2)
V(x)Y(x).

00:17:22.979 --> 00:17:30.318
If I get tired of writing it,
I will call it HY.

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.221
That's of course a postulate,
because you can never derive

00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:36.022
Schrödinger's equation any
more than you can derive

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:36.940
Newton's laws.
 

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.496
This is, as I said,
one of the most powerful

00:17:39.496 --> 00:17:42.926
equations in modern physics,
because it contains all of

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:46.224
non-relativistic quantum
mechanics and all of classical

00:17:46.224 --> 00:17:48.521
mechanics,
and all of solid state physics

00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:50.348
and super fluids and
superconductors.

00:17:50.348 --> 00:17:54.980
Everything comes from this
equation.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.328
A very powerful equation.
 

00:17:57.328 --> 00:18:01.670
Okay, now what did we learn
from this equation?

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.930
I will mention one thing that's
very important.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.380
It's a consequence of the
equation,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.269
which is, if you start the
system out at time t = 0,

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:14.413
in a state of definite energy
and you see what happens if I

00:18:14.413 --> 00:18:18.604
wait some time,
well, it becomes the following

00:18:18.604 --> 00:18:20.538
function at time t.
 

00:18:20.538 --> 00:18:25.443
It's essentially the same
function, multiplied by

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:28.509
[e^(i)]Et/ℏ.
 

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:30.332
You realize,
generally a wave function,

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:32.921
when you let it evolve,
will flop and wiggle and change

00:18:32.921 --> 00:18:34.598
its shape in a complicated way.
 

00:18:34.598 --> 00:18:38.266
But if you release it in this
initial condition,

00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:40.838
all that happens to it is that.
 

00:18:40.838 --> 00:18:44.546
These are called stationary
states, because despite the time

00:18:44.546 --> 00:18:47.875
dependence I showed you,
the probability for measuring

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:49.950
anything is time independent.
 

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.613
Because when you take the
probability, you find the

00:18:52.613 --> 00:18:55.914
absolute value of some integral,
and the absolute value of this

00:18:55.914 --> 00:18:57.299
factor just goes away.
 

00:18:57.299 --> 00:18:59.088
So it's time independent.
 

00:18:59.088 --> 00:19:00.690
That's why we're very
interested.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.490
If you want an atom and the
atom has been sitting for a long

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.420
time, it will be in one of these
states of definite energy.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.690
So that's the case of starting
in a state of definite energy,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.420
but then I said,
"Maybe I don't want to

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.950
start in a state of definite
energy;

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.838
I want to start in an arbitrary
state."

00:19:18.838 --> 00:19:22.574
At time 0 I'm going to give you
a Y (x ,0) and I'm

00:19:22.574 --> 00:19:25.108
going to ask you,
"What is the fate of this

00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:26.430
state,
if I wait some time

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.240
p?"
 

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.578
The simple answer is,
take Y(x ,0),

00:19:30.578 --> 00:19:33.923
calculate
A_E=∫

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:38.886
Y_E'
Y(x,0)dx and then

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:42.987
Y(x,t) =
A_E

00:19:42.987 --> 00:19:46.980
Y_E
(x)

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.078
e^(−iEt/â„ ).
 

00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:53.460
In other words,
if you take your initial state

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.090
and expand it--
this is called expanding it--as

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.332
a sum over states of definite
energy with some coefficients

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:02.444
you compute at t = 0,
then at any future time,

00:20:02.444 --> 00:20:05.040
the coefficients are given
simply by the initial

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.160
coefficients,
times this factor.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.615
You can check that this will
satisfy the Schrödinger

00:20:10.615 --> 00:20:13.946
equation, because every term in
it is a solution to the

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:14.750
equation.
 

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.548
And at t = 0,
when you drop this guy,

00:20:17.548 --> 00:20:21.390
it agrees with the initial
state and that's all you want.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.564
Because in this problem,
because it's first order

00:20:23.564 --> 00:20:25.760
equation in time,
if my initial state matches

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.680
your initial state and satisfies
Schrödinger equation,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.710
it is the answer.
 

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.970
There are no two answers.
 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.655
So I want to give you
one--first let me tell you

00:20:36.655 --> 00:20:40.029
something that's going to make
you relax.

00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:43.880
Everything that I say after
this moment is not in your exam.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.999
I don't want you to worry about
that, because it's an

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:48.527
interesting thing and I want to
tell you all the things you can

00:20:48.527 --> 00:20:49.750
do with quantum mechanics.
 

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.348
I don't want you to worry about
anything.

00:20:51.348 --> 00:20:55.522
Just try to follow this and ask
questions, and get a glimpse of

00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:58.618
what you could possibly do with
this theory.

00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:02.569
First thing you can do is you
can say, "How do I

00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:04.470
understand atoms?"
 

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:08.680
You know the simplest atom in
the world is a hydrogen atom.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.410
It's got a proton and it's got
an electron.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.970
One has charge e,
one has charge -e.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.940
And the proton can be taken to
be so heavy that it is fixed.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.868
Just like when the earth goes
round the sun,

00:21:19.868 --> 00:21:21.868
in principle,
the sun is also moving,

00:21:21.868 --> 00:21:23.896
but we ignore that,
so we're going to ignore the

00:21:23.896 --> 00:21:24.890
motion of the proton.
 

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.950
Then the electron,
in classical mechanics,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.195
it has an energy which is
(p_x^(2)

00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:35.230
p_y^(2)
p_z^(2))/2m.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.892
That's the kinetic energy,
and the potential energy

00:21:39.892 --> 00:21:45.970
-ze^(2)/r, and r
is √(x^(2) y^(2),

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.380
z^(2)). Do you understand
that?

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.058
That's the classical formula
for energy.

00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:55.608
Then our recipe tells us that
in quantum theory,

00:21:55.608 --> 00:22:01.532
states of definite energy will
obey the following equation -

00:22:01.532 --> 00:22:06.250
-ℏ^(2)/2m x
(d^(2)

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.066
Y/dx^(2)
d^(2)Y

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:13.480
/dy^(2)
d^(2)Y

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.701
/dz^(2) ) -
(ze^(2)/√(x^(2) y^(2)

00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:23.519
z^(2)))Y=
EY.

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:28.480
You have to solve that equation.
 

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.930
Now don't worry about how you
solve it.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.930
In fact, even Schrödinger
did not know how to solve it.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.078
He had to ask a mathematician
friend of his how to solve it.

00:22:40.078 --> 00:22:42.880
A mathematician owed him a
favor, because at that time,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.454
the mathematician was having an
affair with Schrödinger's

00:22:46.454 --> 00:22:49.619
wife and you might say,
"Who owed the favor to

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:50.348
whom?"
 

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:52.759
Actually, Schrödinger owed
a favor to this guy,

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:55.311
because meanwhile,
Schrödinger was trying to

00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:57.118
seduce a pair of underage twins.
 

00:22:57.118 --> 00:23:00.583
These are all very interesting
things you don't know about the

00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:04.196
lives of famous people,
but if you read his biography,

00:23:04.196 --> 00:23:07.759
you will find that
Schrödinger's wave function

00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:11.250
was all over the classically
forbidden region.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.140
Anyway, he's a very interesting
person.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.432
But what I want you to know is
that even he couldn't solve the

00:23:18.432 --> 00:23:19.078
equations.
 

00:23:19.078 --> 00:23:22.205
I don't care if you solve it or
not, because he had already done

00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:23.098
the great thing.
 

00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:25.140
So you go to this equation and
you solve it.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.880
So this math guy helped him
solve it.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.736
Nowadays, undergraduates,
graduates, everybody knows how

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:32.593
to solve it, but the first time
it came, it was quite an

00:23:32.593 --> 00:23:33.838
unfamiliar equation.
 

00:23:33.838 --> 00:23:38.001
If you solve this thing,
what you find is that the

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:41.230
energy can take only certain
values.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:47.196
Those values have some number
in front of them a 13.6 electron

00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:47.980
volts.
 

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.623
That 13.6 electron volts is
some combination of the electric

00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:55.019
charge of Planck's constant and
mass of the electron.

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:55.740
Forget all that.
 

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.452
Some number,
divided by n^(2) where

00:23:58.452 --> 00:24:01.099
n is an integer of 1,2,
3, etc.

00:24:01.099 --> 00:24:02.440
That's it.
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.460
These are the only allowed
energy levels of hydrogen.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.642
If you solve this equation in 3
dimensions and you demand the

00:24:09.642 --> 00:24:12.680
functions vanish at infinity,
rather than blow up at

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.336
infinity, you will find you can
get solutions only at certain

00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:19.690
special energies and these are
the energies you get.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.490
So let's plot these energies.
 

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:26.289
Remember this is energy 0 and
this is n = 1.

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.660
n = 1 is at -13.6eV.
 

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:37.358
n = 2 will be -13.6/4eV.
 

00:24:37.358 --> 00:24:40.089
n = 3 will be that thing
divided by 9 and so on.

00:24:40.089 --> 00:24:43.720
These are the allowed energies.
 

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.804
See, that's a great result,
because you are able to find

00:24:47.804 --> 00:24:52.037
out for the first time what
energies are available to this

00:24:52.037 --> 00:24:53.987
atom,
and furthermore,

00:24:53.987 --> 00:24:58.588
you also learn that if this
atom were able to absorb light,

00:24:58.588 --> 00:25:02.061
it can do that only say by
going from here to here or going

00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:05.000
from here to here,
or going from one allowed level

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.410
to another allowed level.
 

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.017
And the difference in energy is
E_f -

00:25:10.017 --> 00:25:14.101
E_i will be
ℏw of the

00:25:14.101 --> 00:25:14.849
photon.
 

00:25:14.849 --> 00:25:17.710
That will allow it to go up.
 

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.077
Or it can also come down,
and if it comes down from some

00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:24.171
level,
n = 4 to n = 2,

00:25:24.171 --> 00:25:26.207
it may,
let's see, 1,2,

00:25:26.207 --> 00:25:30.298
3,4, it can go from 5 to 2,
it will emit some light.

00:25:30.298 --> 00:25:32.546
In fact, this is the only way
we know anything about the

00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:33.200
hydrogen atom.
 

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.980
No one can see the hydrogen
atom.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.359
You cannot actually see it
because the act of observation

00:25:38.359 --> 00:25:39.930
will destroy everything.
 

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.555
But we know it's there;
we know it's doing its thing by

00:25:42.555 --> 00:25:45.892
shining light on it and seeing
what it absorbs and what it

00:25:45.892 --> 00:25:46.420
emits.
 

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.064
The understanding of the
quantum world is very different

00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:50.170
from classical world.
 

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.243
For example,
if Newton says,

00:25:51.243 --> 00:25:52.875
"I know the orbits or
ellipses,"

00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:53.828
you can go see them.
 

00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:56.308
That's what Kepler did,
looked at them for 40 years,

00:25:56.308 --> 00:25:58.400
you can see they go in
elliptical orbits.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.808
For hydrogen,
there are no orbits.

00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:04.521
There are energy levels and
there are these corresponding

00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.510
wave functions,
Y (x,

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.440
y ,z).
 

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.733
And you can plot them and you
know if you start out with any

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.750
one particular state,
it will stay that way forever.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.780
And the probability density,
I told you, is also fixed in

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.160
time.
 

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.567
They are the clouds one finds
in textbook as shape of various

00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:24.009
atomic orbits.
 

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:29.670
Okay, yes, there's only one
other thing I should mention,

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.598
which is that even though these
are the only allowed energies,

00:26:33.598 --> 00:26:38.308
there's more than one state at
a given energy.

00:26:38.308 --> 00:26:41.086
You may remember when I did a
particle on a ring,

00:26:41.086 --> 00:26:43.458
at a given energy,
there are two states of

00:26:43.458 --> 00:26:44.210
momentum.
 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.890
One has got momentum = square
root of 2mE,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.828
other has got momentum square
root of -2mE,

00:26:50.828 --> 00:26:52.920
because when you take the
square and divide by 2m,

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.338
you get the same energy.
 

00:26:54.338 --> 00:26:56.680
So a given energy can have two
states.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.950
Here a given energy can have
many states.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.467
There's only one here and here
you can have 4,

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:03.808
and here you can more.
 

00:27:03.808 --> 00:27:06.538
There are ways to calculate
them.

00:27:06.538 --> 00:27:09.679
Then it turns out that even
this 1 is actually 2,

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:13.145
because it's another variable
which does not enter our

00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:16.088
physics, called the spin of the
electron.

00:27:16.088 --> 00:27:18.917
I don't want to even go there,
but it can do one of two

00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:19.390
things.
 

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.230
So everything I do here,
you've got to double.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.211
So really, there are two states
of energy, lowest energy and

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.170
there are 8 here and so on.
 

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.017
These magic numbers come out of
doing the Schrödinger

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:32.759
equation.
 

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:35.910
All right, so that's an example
of what you can do with quantum

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.519
mechanics.
 

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:39.794
You can solve for the spectrum
of atoms and you can see what

00:27:39.794 --> 00:27:42.680
light they will emit,
what light they will absorb.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.818
You can even go beyond that.
 

00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:46.515
You can even ask,
what's the rate at which it

00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:47.740
will absorb light?
 

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.338
What's the rate at which it
will emit light?

00:27:49.338 --> 00:27:51.410
Everything can be computed,
because you see,

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.963
you not only know the energies,
you also know the corresponding

00:27:54.963 --> 00:27:58.116
functions and they are very
important in calculating the

00:27:58.116 --> 00:28:00.868
rate of absorption and the rate
of emission.

00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:03.390
Okay, that's one thing you can
do.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:09.028
Now I'm going to tell you about
another uncertainty principle

00:28:09.028 --> 00:28:12.130
which takes the following form.
 

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:16.248
It says DE
Dt &gt;

00:28:16.248 --> 00:28:18.170
=ℏ.
 

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.588
I've got to tell you what it
means.

00:28:21.588 --> 00:28:25.170
It looks a lot like this one,
DpDx

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.961
&gt; = ℏ,
but it's very different in

00:28:28.961 --> 00:28:32.730
nature, because x is the
position of something.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.288
You can try to measure it.
 

00:28:34.288 --> 00:28:36.410
 p is the momentum of
something, you can try to

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:36.930
measure it.
 

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.880
t is not the time of
something.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.308
t is just time.
 

00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:43.165
It's not time of this or that,
and it can be measured

00:28:43.165 --> 00:28:44.539
arbitrarily accurately.
 

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:46.568
That is not the problem.
 

00:28:46.568 --> 00:28:48.627
So I will have to tell you the
meaning of this uncertainty

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:49.170
relationship.
 

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.430
It is different from the others.
 

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.529
There are many such things in
quantum mechanics,

00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:56.305
but this is unique in the sense
that unlike x and p

00:28:56.305 --> 00:28:58.568
which are physical
variables,

00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:00.759
time is not a variable
describing a particle.

00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:05.009
It's an independent parameter
along which everything happens.

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:07.009
But I'll tell you what this
means,

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:09.452
but before that,
I want to go back to the

00:29:09.452 --> 00:29:12.394
uncertainty principle,
which you notice I never

00:29:12.394 --> 00:29:14.809
mention, because it is not a
postulate,

00:29:14.809 --> 00:29:16.380
it's a consequence.
 

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.776
And I told you all about trying
to look at something with a

00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:20.430
microscope and have you shine
photons.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.078
And a lot of you tried to find
ways to get around that,

00:29:23.078 --> 00:29:24.390
and say, "Maybe if you did
this,

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.396
maybe if you did that,
you can beat the uncertainty

00:29:26.396 --> 00:29:27.118
principle."
 

00:29:27.118 --> 00:29:29.180
So I'm going to put you out of
your misery.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.478
You cannot beat the uncertainty
principle for the following

00:29:32.478 --> 00:29:32.990
reason.
 

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.880
Forget about quantum mechanics.
 

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.009
Let's ask the following
question - what is the

00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:41.579
wavelength of this signal?
 

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:46.960
This is 1 meter long.
 

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.717
You might say it's 1 meter,
but that's not a correct

00:29:50.717 --> 00:29:51.380
answer.
 

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.890
This signal doesn't have a 1
meter wavelength.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.823
You know who has a 1 meter
wavelength is this guy who goes

00:29:57.823 --> 00:29:58.720
on forever.
 

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.380
That is a wave of 1 meter
wavelength.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.714
This was 1 meter for a while,
then completely dead on either

00:30:04.714 --> 00:30:05.230
side.
 

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.023
So this does not have a
definite wavelength,

00:30:07.023 --> 00:30:08.358
even though you think it does.
 

00:30:08.358 --> 00:30:11.180
A wavelength is a repetitive
phenomenon in space.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.144
It's got to repeat itself
indefinitely to have a unique

00:30:16.144 --> 00:30:17.338
wavelength.
 

00:30:17.338 --> 00:30:21.348
So let's take a wave train that
looks like this.

00:30:21.348 --> 00:30:24.019
You somehow chop it off nicely
near the end.

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:28.730
It does some number of
oscillations and then it stops.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.970
What is the wavelength
associated with this?

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.471
You can associate an
approximate wavelength as

00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.250
follows.
 

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.373
First let me remind you that we
want to think in terms of

00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:42.730
k which is 2p/l.
 

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.979
It's a reciprocal of a
wavelength, and if you remember,

00:30:45.979 --> 00:30:49.529
functions look like kx -
wt when we studied waves.

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:52.329
k is that.
 

00:30:52.329 --> 00:30:55.220
What's the meaning of k?
 

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.167
k is the rate of change
of phase of the wave,

00:30:58.167 --> 00:31:01.519
because if you go a distance
x, the phase changes by

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.329
kx.
 

00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:03.519
You watch the wave change.
 

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:07.442
Every cycle is worth 2p and it
changes by some amount over some

00:31:07.442 --> 00:31:08.140
distance.
 

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.025
k is the ratio of how
much phase change you had

00:31:11.025 --> 00:31:13.039
divided by the distance you
travel.

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:13.759
Do you understand that?
 

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:15.058
That's k.
 

00:31:15.058 --> 00:31:21.978
So let me take this wave and
the k for this will be 2p times

00:31:21.978 --> 00:31:28.310
the number of cycles here
divided by the length of that

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.068
wave train.
 

00:31:30.068 --> 00:31:32.180
But there is no unique n
you can associate with it.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.227
These are all full cycles,
but once you come near the end

00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:38.057
there's a little bit of
confusion as to what to do at

00:31:38.057 --> 00:31:38.710
the end.
 

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:39.838
How do you close it off?
 

00:31:39.838 --> 00:31:43.986
So there's an error or
uncertainty of about 1 cycle

00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:46.058
coming from the 2 ends.
 

00:31:46.058 --> 00:31:50.107
So the uncertainty in k
is 2 p/L times the

00:31:50.107 --> 00:31:54.819
uncertainty in n which is
1 or 2, but that's all it is.

00:31:54.819 --> 00:31:55.368
You understand?
 

00:31:55.368 --> 00:31:57.953
A finite wave train,
when you round out the edges,

00:31:57.953 --> 00:32:00.170
it may not have a full number
of cycles.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.818
You taper it off in some
fashion, but here you've got a

00:32:02.818 --> 00:32:04.390
well defined number of cycles.
 

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.349
So it's or - 1 coming from the
ends.

00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:10.150
So Dk is that.
 

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:14.077
But this is a particle which is
now confined to a region of

00:32:14.077 --> 00:32:18.210
length L because the wave
function is 0 beyond that.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.180
So it's a particle whose
position is known to lie inside

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.068
this interval of length
L.

00:32:23.068 --> 00:32:26.778
So the uncertainty in position
is L.

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:30.212
Again, uncertainty is a
technical definition,

00:32:30.212 --> 00:32:33.490
but this is our qualitative
explanation.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.819
So L is really
Dx.

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:37.759
You can write Dx.
 

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:41.880
Dk is 2p.
 

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.230
This has nothing to do with
quantum mechanics.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.480
Where did I mention quantum
mechanics?

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.368
I'm saying something
intuitively very clear.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:54.133
If you're defining a
wavelength, you have to let it

00:32:54.133 --> 00:32:56.088
run through many cycles.
 

00:32:56.088 --> 00:32:58.356
For example,
if you say this guy goes to New

00:32:58.356 --> 00:33:00.730
York every week,
and you observed him for only

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.630
one week, that's got no meaning.
 

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.558
God knows what will happen next
week.

00:33:04.558 --> 00:33:07.310
But if you studied a person for
50 weeks and found 50 times the

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.970
person went to New York,
it's more credible when you say

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.950
this person goes to New York
once a week.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.125
So periodic phenomenon,
either in time or in space,

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:18.298
are defined only after many,
many, many periods.

00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:21.856
Therefore a wavelength cannot
be defined for an arbitrarily

00:33:21.856 --> 00:33:22.900
short interval.
 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.192
In fact, the longer the
interval, the more wavelengths

00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:27.140
you can fit in to say that's my
wavelength.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.144
So wavelength gets more and
more defined as the train gets

00:33:30.144 --> 00:33:32.621
longer and therefore the
incompatibility between

00:33:32.621 --> 00:33:34.940
wavelength and the length of the
train,

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.490
the fact that if it's too short
in one,

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.180
it's too big in the other one,
is a classical result.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.259
Quantum mechanics comes in with
a new relation that the momentum

00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:48.369
of a particle is connected to
this wave number by

00:33:48.369 --> 00:33:49.858
ℏk.
 

00:33:49.858 --> 00:33:52.720
Multiply both sides by
ℏ,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.730
ℏ there and
h here,

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.383
then it becomes
DxDp

00:33:59.383 --> 00:34:02.630
is roughly about an ℏ.
 

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.798
So once you concede that a
particle has definite momentum

00:34:05.798 --> 00:34:09.250
only if it has a definite
wavelength in its wave function,

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.983
that wave function has to be
very extended to have a definite

00:34:12.983 --> 00:34:15.909
wavelength and therefore a
definite momentum.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.739
So there is no way you can make
it--there's no way you can take

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.568
a wave arbitrarily short in its
extent with an arbitrarily well

00:34:23.568 --> 00:34:24.989
defined wavelength.
 

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.429
You've got to let it do its
thing many times.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:32.161
Mathematically what happens is,
there's a mathematical theorem

00:34:32.161 --> 00:34:35.952
that says any function you write
down can be built out of waves

00:34:35.952 --> 00:34:39.989
of all possible wavelengths with
suitably chosen coefficients.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.360
If your wave has an almost well
defined wavelength,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.480
then the coefficients,
as the function of wavelength,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.686
will have a very sharp peak at
the wavelength corresponding to

00:34:50.686 --> 00:34:51.170
this.
 

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.936
And as the wave repeats more
and more and more times,

00:34:53.936 --> 00:34:57.289
the coefficients will become
sharper and sharper and sharper.

00:34:57.289 --> 00:34:59.231
As the wave becomes very small,
if you say "What's the

00:34:59.231 --> 00:35:00.269
wavelength of this guy?"
 

00:35:00.269 --> 00:35:02.789
it will be very broad.
 

00:35:02.789 --> 00:35:04.400
It's nothing to do with quantum
mechanics.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.429
It's just the incompatibility
between two qualities,

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:08.440
you understand?
 

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.460
Wavelength needs some time to
express itself.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.460
You cannot do it in a tiny
region.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.983
So if you want to localize the
particle, how can it tell you in

00:35:17.983 --> 00:35:21.050
the tiny region what its
frequency of oscillation is in

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.619
space?
 

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:24.219
So once you concede that,
once you concede that

00:35:24.219 --> 00:35:27.440
wavelength is connected to
momentum, you cannot escape the

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.909
uncertainty principle.
 

00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:33.340
So now I'm going to come back
to energy and time,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.940
and I come back in the
following way.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.317
Remember, a state of definite
energy E behaves as

00:35:41.317 --> 00:35:42.750
follows in time.
 

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:50.487
It looks like Y(x)
times e^(−iEt/

00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:53.018
ℏ).
 

00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:56.623
So state of definite energy,
you know the particle has

00:35:56.623 --> 00:36:00.295
definite energy if you observe
the wave function and it

00:36:00.295 --> 00:36:01.860
oscillates in time.
 

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.481
And you can write this as
e^(-i)^(w)

00:36:05.481 --> 00:36:08.137
^(t),
where w is

00:36:08.137 --> 00:36:10.070
E/ℏ.
 

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.025
So your particle that has been
in that state forever has a well

00:36:14.025 --> 00:36:15.110
defined energy.
 

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.239
But if a particle was just put
in that state right now,

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:21.099
the wave function really does
this only from t = 0,

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:24.885
before that it was something
else, then this function has not

00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:28.670
oscillated enough times for you
to define its time period.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.320
So if you're watching an
oscillation,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.179
let's say it's an oscillation
in time,

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:35.574
and you say,
"What's the time period of

00:36:35.574 --> 00:36:36.690
oscillation?"
 

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.755
again, if it extends over a
certain time T,

00:36:41.755 --> 00:36:47.650
the frequency w is just the
phase change per unit time.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.262
So it's 2p times the number of
cycles, but there's an

00:36:51.262 --> 00:36:55.639
uncertainty in N of order
1 that's 2p/T.

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:58.771
Therefore if the system has
been in existence for a time

00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.789
T and I call that time as
Dt--

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:03.340
that's the meaning of
Dt--

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.960
Dt Dw is 2p,
then quantum mechanics comes in

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.630
when you put an
ℏ here,

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.722
you put an ℏ
there and you call that the

00:37:13.722 --> 00:37:15.510
uncertainty in energy.
 

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.722
In other words,
if someone tells me,

00:37:17.722 --> 00:37:20.760
"Go see if that clock is a
regular clock.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.554
Tell me if it's running
rhythmically and

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:25.059
periodically."
 

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:28.153
Well, if you give me enough
time, I observe it for 100

00:37:28.153 --> 00:37:30.139
cycles, I say it's a good clock.
 

00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:32.690
But if you don't give me time
even to finish one cycle,

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.099
how can I tell you anything
about its period yet?

00:37:35.099 --> 00:37:36.750
It hasn't had time to establish
a period.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.010
Periodic phenomena have to
repeat themselves,

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.789
so it takes some time.
 

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:44.802
Therefore for a state to have a
well-defined period,

00:37:44.802 --> 00:37:46.989
that is to say,
a well defined energy,

00:37:46.989 --> 00:37:49.590
it has to be in existence for
some time.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.880
Then it has a well-defined
energy.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.085
Okay, therefore you can say
that if you've had time to

00:37:57.085 --> 00:38:00.340
measure energy only for a finite
time,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.130
then energy will not be defined
to better than this accuracy,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.650
DE
Dt is of order

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.250
ℏ.
 

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.728
Let me give you an example that
is from classical mechanics,

00:38:13.728 --> 00:38:16.030
nothing to do with quantum
mechanics.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.820
You take a bunch of reeds,
you attach them to the wall.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.099
Each one has a different length
maybe.

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:26.048
They have many frequencies of
vibration, natural frequencies

00:38:26.048 --> 00:38:28.726
of vibration,
depending on the length and

00:38:28.726 --> 00:38:29.530
whatnot.
 

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.260
Now if you connect this whole
thing,

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.210
apparatus, to some vibrating
gadget,

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.887
start shaking the whole thing,
suppose you shake it at a

00:38:38.887 --> 00:38:44.275
certain frequency,
omega 0 that matches maybe this

00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:44.980
guy.
 

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.161
Namely, it resonates with this
guy, so your expectation is,

00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:53.559
this one will oscillate like
crazy and the others will not.

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:55.760
So let me look at this rod from
the edge, okay?

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.710
I look at them end on,
they all look like this.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.690
They're coming out of the
blackboard.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.737
So I expect this one to be
resonating wildly up and down

00:39:03.737 --> 00:39:08.152
and the others to be ignoring
the signal because they are not

00:39:08.152 --> 00:39:10.360
at the resonant frequency.
 

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.902
But what will happen in real
life is that you will take the

00:39:13.902 --> 00:39:17.840
system and you start shaking it,
your intention is to shake it

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.130
at a very definite frequency
that matches this guy,

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.320
but the system does not know
your plans.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.768
After quarter of a cycle,
it knows you've exerted that

00:39:27.768 --> 00:39:28.289
force.
 

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:31.170
It doesn't know you plan to
keep doing this.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.688
So at that time,
what it will do is it will try

00:39:33.688 --> 00:39:37.030
to write this as a sum of many
waves of definite frequency.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.949
They will contain many,
many frequencies,

00:39:38.949 --> 00:39:41.641
so what you will find is,
this guy also oscillates a

00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:43.865
little bit,
that guy also oscillates a

00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:46.320
little bit,
and as you wait longer and

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.398
longer, so the system caught on
to the fact that you are really

00:39:50.398 --> 00:39:53.949
serious and sending a signal of
definite frequency.

00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:56.353
And when it has stabilized,
you will find these guys don't

00:39:56.353 --> 00:40:00.126
move, these guys don't move;
the guy at the resonant

00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:01.980
frequency moves.
 

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.556
So you've got to understand,
it takes some time for the

00:40:05.556 --> 00:40:08.670
system to know what frequency
you're sending.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.835
If you have not sent many
cycles, if you have sent only

00:40:12.835 --> 00:40:15.487
this much,
it does not consider that a

00:40:15.487 --> 00:40:17.282
periodic function,
because to it,

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:19.612
the function would really do
that or it could do something

00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:19.940
else.
 

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.420
It goes with the information it
has.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.670
It goes to the mathematical
tables and finds the Fourier

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.880
series for this and sees what
frequencies are there.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.480
And anything that's not 0 can
excite all these things.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.654
And after a while,
when the frequency is well

00:40:33.654 --> 00:40:35.530
defined, one reed moves.
 

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.239
Same thing happens with atoms.
 

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:39.494
I don't know,
somewhere I drew a picture of

00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:42.608
atoms absorbing energy.So take
this atom here in the ground

00:40:42.608 --> 00:40:43.789
state of hydrogen.
 

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:47.779
Send light of the frequency
just correct to go to the first

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.050
excited state,
to n = 2.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.378
You take a laser or something
of that frequency and you hit

00:40:53.378 --> 00:40:54.010
the atom.
 

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.239
Take a collection of atoms and
you will think they will all

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:00.358
jump from the ground state to
the first state but nowhere

00:41:00.358 --> 00:41:00.860
else.
 

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.601
But you will find the minute
you turn on the laser,

00:41:03.601 --> 00:41:06.454
even though the laser dials say
this is my frequency,

00:41:06.454 --> 00:41:07.880
atoms don't know that.
 

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.403
So initially,
it will jump like crazy to all

00:41:10.403 --> 00:41:13.750
kinds of energy states and only
after sufficient time,

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.210
only after many cycles have
happened,

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.840
it will realize, "Hey,
this is the frequency this

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.710
guy's sending me."
 

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.150
Then it will start going
preferentially to the one state.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:26.144
Okay, now the final topic I
want to talk about is really the

00:41:26.144 --> 00:41:29.248
beginning of a long topic,
but I want to give an

00:41:29.248 --> 00:41:32.179
introduction to it because
you're going to need this.

00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:35.275
And the question is,
what if I have not just 1

00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:37.960
electron but 2,
not 1 particle but 2.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.309
After all, in real life,
there are lots of particles.

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:43.438
What does the quantum mechanics
of more than 1 particle look

00:41:43.438 --> 00:41:43.809
like?
 

00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:46.838
So if there are 2 particles,
let's say an electron and a

00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:49.833
proton,
you will not be surprised that

00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:53.989
you will now have a wave
function of 2 variables,

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:56.510
and if you squared that wave
function,

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.797
you will get
Y(x_1)

00:41:58.797 --> 00:42:00.760
Y(x_2)
--

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.389
Y(x_1),
x_2^(2),

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:08.556
will give you the probability
that the proton is at

00:42:08.556 --> 00:42:11.215
x_1 and the
electron is at

00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:12.800
x_2.
 

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.771
You've got 2 things,
you've got to give 2

00:42:14.771 --> 00:42:16.202
probabilities,
but once again,

00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:18.570
probabilities come from
squaring a function.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:22.329
This has to be a function of 2
variables, because each guy has

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:23.500
his own position.
 

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.940
So you can expect that in
quantum theory of 2 particles,

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.869
you'll get a Y that
depends on 2 coordinates,

00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:30.010
with 3 particles,
Y that depends on 3.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.215
But let me just stop with 2,
because you can learn some very

00:42:34.215 --> 00:42:38.420
profound things in about 5
minutes just by starting here.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.219
Now let's consider,
so let's take a concrete

00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:41.869
example.
 

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:45.840
These guys are both in a box,
let's say.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:52.594
Let's take a simple case,
Yof x1 x2 = Ya of

00:42:52.594 --> 00:42:57.539
x1 Yb of x2,
where a and b are wave

00:42:57.539 --> 00:43:03.449
functions of energy in a box
with 1 particle.

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:07.780
For example,
this could be the state a and

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.739
this could be the state b.
 

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:13.126
The probability to find the
proton at some place and the

00:43:13.126 --> 00:43:15.686
electron at some place is not
the same as the probability of

00:43:15.686 --> 00:43:17.510
finding them with exchanged
positions.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.291
For example,
the chance of finding the

00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:24.880
electron here and the proton in
the middle of the box is 0.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.239
The proton's function vanishes
in the middle of the box.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:31.635
But the probability of finding
the electron in the middle of

00:43:31.635 --> 00:43:33.880
the box and the proton here is
not 0.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.264
That's perfectly okay,
because there are two different

00:43:36.264 --> 00:43:37.570
outcomes of the experiment.
 

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.880
I look for the particles.
 

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.820
I find the electron here and
the proton there.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.358
I say I found this guy here and
that there, and I do it many,

00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:46.599
many times and you give me the
odds.

00:43:46.599 --> 00:43:50.052
But something very dramatic
happens if the 2 particles are

00:43:50.052 --> 00:43:50.780
identical.
 

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.628
Identical particles in quantum
mechanics have very different

00:43:54.628 --> 00:43:57.826
connotations from identical
particles in classical

00:43:57.826 --> 00:43:58.739
mechanics.
 

00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:01.110
So in classical mechanics,
suppose you have identical

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.750
twins, okay?
 

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.250
They're born and they're
separated, they're moving

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.710
around.
 

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.119
Let's say they look identical
in every way.

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.710
We can still follow them.
 

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.050
We know this is Joe and this is
Moe.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:14.371
Follow the two characters no
matter how identical they are,

00:44:14.371 --> 00:44:17.179
because we can keep track of
them continuously.

00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:21.146
So let's do the following
experiment involving these

00:44:21.146 --> 00:44:21.768
twins.
 

00:44:21.768 --> 00:44:26.188
There are 4 doors in this room
and 1 twin comes out like this,

00:44:26.188 --> 00:44:28.869
the other twin comes out like
that.

00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:31.070
Then they do one of 2 things.
 

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:37.858
Either they cross over like
this, or this guy goes back to

00:44:37.858 --> 00:44:43.219
that door, that guy goes back to
this door.

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:46.099
Now suppose you saw them
running like this in the

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:48.746
beginning,
and you left the room when this

00:44:48.746 --> 00:44:51.407
was happening,
and you saw them enter these 2

00:44:51.407 --> 00:44:53.871
doors,
you cannot tell which of the 2

00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:55.920
happened,
because you've just got 2

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.539
identical twins and these 2
identical exit doors.

00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:00.059
But somebody knows what happens.
 

00:45:00.059 --> 00:45:02.932
Somebody in that room who was
watching them can clearly tell

00:45:02.932 --> 00:45:05.903
you, if this happened or that
happened, because you can follow

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:07.219
the twins at all times.
 

00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:09.219
So even though they're
identical, they're

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:10.119
distinguishable.
 

00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:14.039
They cannot swap roles without
your knowing.

00:45:14.039 --> 00:45:18.128
But imagine now that these are
not classical particles but

00:45:18.128 --> 00:45:20.710
quantum particles,
like electrons.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:22.994
For an electron,
you don't have a definite

00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:24.500
location or a trajectory.
 

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.340
You only have probabilities.
 

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.519
So you know an electron was
emitted here and emitted here,

00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:32.199
and later on was absorbed here
and absorbed here,

00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:34.710
and you cannot tell who really
came here.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.820
Was it this guy or was it that
guy?

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.159
There's no way to tell.
 

00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:43.144
So when you have identical
particles whose trajectories you

00:45:43.144 --> 00:45:45.586
cannot follow,
when you catch a particle here

00:45:45.586 --> 00:45:48.635
and a particle there,
you cannot say Joe was here and

00:45:48.635 --> 00:45:49.530
Moe was there.
 

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.458
It's not allowed,
because you're not following

00:45:51.458 --> 00:45:52.059
their names.
 

00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:54.304
You can only say,
"I found a particle here,

00:45:54.304 --> 00:45:55.880
I found a particle there."
 

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.601
Therefore the theory cannot
give different probabilities for

00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:02.630
finding particle 1 here and
particle 2 there,

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.369
and particle 2 there and
particle 1 here,

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:07.239
because the outcomes are
indistinguishable,

00:46:07.239 --> 00:46:10.150
so the probabilities must be
equal.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.597
So for 2 identical
particles, p (x_1

00:46:12.597 --> 00:46:15.197
x_2) must =
p( x_2

00:46:15.197 --> 00:46:16.369
x_1).
 

00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:20.380
That's not true for these
functions.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.980
Now I'll write a function for
which it's actually true.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:30.516
Can you make a guess on what it
may be, what kind of function

00:46:30.516 --> 00:46:35.498
will respect the fact that if
you swap the coordinates,

00:46:35.498 --> 00:46:38.360
probabilities don't change?
 

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.577
We know there's particle in
state a and a particle in state

00:46:41.577 --> 00:46:43.018
b and they're identical.
 

00:46:43.018 --> 00:46:48.347
This says particle 1 is in and
2 is in b, but you're not

00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:53.288
allowed to say who is who,
so the correct answer is,

00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:55.710
you can also do this.
 

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.679
Look at this function now.
 

00:46:59.679 --> 00:47:02.213
Here it's a superposition,
quantum mechanical

00:47:02.213 --> 00:47:04.527
superposition of --
1 doing something,

00:47:04.527 --> 00:47:06.739
2 doing something else,
the opposite.

00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:08.139
You add them together.
 

00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:10.003
Now I invite you to check that
if you exchange

00:47:10.003 --> 00:47:11.869
x_1 and
x_2,

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:12.739
see what happens.
 

00:47:12.739 --> 00:47:13.914
This becomes
Y_a(

00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:15.590
x_2),
that guy sitting here.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.777
This becomes
Y_b(

00:47:16.777 --> 00:47:18.469
x_1),
that guy sitting here.

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:19.389
This becomes
Y_b(

00:47:19.389 --> 00:47:20.590
x_2),
that sitting here.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:24.610
So these 2 terms exchange roles
when you exchange the particles.

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:27.398
Y(x) to
x_1 is in fact

00:47:27.398 --> 00:47:30.003
Y(x)--
Y(x_1,

00:47:30.003 --> 00:47:33.224
x_2) is the same as
Y(x_2,

00:47:33.224 --> 00:47:34.340
x_1).
 

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.351
So that is an allowed state in
quantum mechanics,

00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:42.699
where you add them and you
symmetrize the product.

00:47:42.699 --> 00:47:43.820
You guys following that?
 

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.690
Now I'm going to try another
combination.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:52.780
I'm going to put a - sign here.
 

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.960
If you put a - sign,
perhaps you can see if I

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.092
exchange the 2 guys and this
goes into that,

00:47:57.092 --> 00:47:59.472
that goes into this,
I don't come back to where I

00:47:59.472 --> 00:47:59.920
am.
 

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.210
I come back to where the - of
this guy.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.646
If this looked like x -
y, that looks like y -

00:48:07.646 --> 00:48:08.090
x.
 

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.688
So you might say,
"Hey, things are not the

00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:13.119
same when I exchange the
particles."

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:15.764
But remember,
the physical quantities are not

00:48:15.764 --> 00:48:18.590
given by Y but the square
of Y.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.800
The probabilities are not
Y;

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.400
the probabilities are
Y^(2).

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.713
So even with the - sign,
the probability for

00:48:24.713 --> 00:48:26.775
x_1,
x_2 here is also the

00:48:26.775 --> 00:48:28.876
same as the probability for
x_2 ,x_1

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.016
here,
because when you find the

00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:33.630
absolute value,
the - sign goes away.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.728
So in quantum mechanics,
there are 2 options for

00:48:36.728 --> 00:48:38.179
identical particles.
 

00:48:38.179 --> 00:48:42.251
Either you can take the product
function and add to it the

00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:46.108
product with the reversed
coordinates, or subtract from

00:48:46.108 --> 00:48:46.610
it.
 

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:51.045
And the particles in the world,
all of them decide to go with

00:48:51.045 --> 00:48:52.820
one camp or the other.
 

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:58.541
Particles called bosons always
choose that sign,

00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:05.480
and particles called fermions
always choose the - sign.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.030
And every particle is either
boson or fermion.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.550
P mesons are bosons.
 

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:10.760
Photons are bosons.
 

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.940
Electrons are fermions.
 

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.159
Quarks are fermions.
 

00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:14.579
Gravitons are bosons.
 

00:49:14.579 --> 00:49:16.768
So everybody is one or the
other.

00:49:16.768 --> 00:49:19.264
If you put 2 bosons in a box,
their wave function,

00:49:19.264 --> 00:49:21.659
when you exchange them,
will remain the same.

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:27.193
If you put 2 fermions in a box,
the wave function will change

00:49:27.193 --> 00:49:27.840
sign.
 

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.710
But now here is the beautiful
result.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.880
Take this case for 2 fermions
and ask yourself--this is a

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.760
fermionic wave function for 2
particles.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.485
Ask yourself the following
question - can they both be in

00:49:43.485 --> 00:49:45.150
the same quantum state?
 

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.123
In other words,
can the state a be the same as

00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:49.050
the state b?
 

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.969
Remember, here a was this and b
was that.

00:49:50.969 --> 00:49:54.699
I'm asking, can they both be in
the same state?

00:49:54.699 --> 00:49:57.289
So I invite you to put a = b
here.

00:49:57.289 --> 00:49:59.150
Let's see what happens.
 

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.670
That's a.
 

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:04.340
That's also a.
 

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.989
What do you get?
 

00:50:06.989 --> 00:50:11.139
Can you see something when both
are a?

00:50:11.139 --> 00:50:14.099
You get 0.
 

00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:17.244
So you cannot write a wave
function in which the 2 fermions

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:20.280
are in the same state,
and that's the Pauli principle.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.253
Pauli principle says,
for some of the particles,

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:25.469
they cannot be in the same
state.

00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:28.137
Bosons, on the other hand,
can be in the same state and

00:50:28.137 --> 00:50:29.670
like to be in the same state.
 

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.751
I don't have time to talk about
that, but this is the Pauli

00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.389
principle.
 

00:50:33.389 --> 00:50:36.525
And you can show if you've got
3 fermions and 4 fermions and so

00:50:36.525 --> 00:50:38.378
on,
you will find out the quantum

00:50:38.378 --> 00:50:41.742
mechanical wave functions never
allow any 2 of them to be in the

00:50:41.742 --> 00:50:42.489
same state.
 

00:50:42.489 --> 00:50:48.420
And that is the origin of the
entire periodic table of atoms,

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.529
because what you do when you've
got many electrons in an atom

00:50:51.529 --> 00:50:54.822
is,
you find these energy levels

00:50:54.822 --> 00:50:58.898
that you did,
the 1/n^(2) that you

00:50:58.898 --> 00:51:00.519
got,
but the nuclear charge of

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:01.420
course may not be 1.
 

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.188
It's some non 0 number,
depending on how many charges

00:51:05.188 --> 00:51:06.710
are in the nucleus.
 

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.722
You take these levels,
I don't know how many levels

00:51:09.722 --> 00:51:11.952
there are here,
then you start putting

00:51:11.952 --> 00:51:13.400
electrons into them.
 

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.789
The first electron will go here.
 

00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:19.474
It turns out they have
something called spin,

00:51:19.474 --> 00:51:23.195
so I will just say 1 way goes
with down and 1 way goes with up

00:51:23.195 --> 00:51:23.989
and down.
 

00:51:23.989 --> 00:51:26.849
The third electron,
you have to put here.

00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:29.550
It has to go to higher energy
state.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.757
If they were bosons,
you can put them all in the

00:51:32.757 --> 00:51:34.260
lowest energy state.
 

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.873
That world will look completely
different from the world we live

00:51:37.873 --> 00:51:38.159
in.
 

00:51:38.159 --> 00:51:40.887
In the world we live in,
the levels keep filling up as

00:51:40.887 --> 00:51:43.099
you put more and more and more
electrons.

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:45.980
They've got to go to higher and
higher energy levels.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:50.474
You go to higher and higher
energy levels,

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:56.835
what happens once in a while
is, you fill all of this right

00:51:56.835 --> 00:52:01.768
now, then that atom becomes very
passive.

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:05.990
It is not interested in either
giving up electrons or taking

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.849
electrons.
 

00:52:06.849 --> 00:52:09.635
Whereas if you had one more
electron here,

00:52:09.635 --> 00:52:12.827
it's very happy to lose this to
some other atom,

00:52:12.827 --> 00:52:16.699
which may have just one
electron in its lowest state.

00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:20.719
It's a waste of it to be here;
it will go sit there.

00:52:20.719 --> 00:52:23.219
Sometimes they like to give an
electron to another atom,

00:52:23.219 --> 00:52:25.193
or if they do,
this will become positively

00:52:25.193 --> 00:52:28.081
charged and that will become
negatively charged and they have

00:52:28.081 --> 00:52:30.730
an attraction and they stay
together as a molecule.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:34.284
So you can understand that as
you go on piling more and more

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:38.199
electrons, a time will come when
this level is completely full.

00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:43.072
That atom, whatever its place
in the periodic table is,

00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:45.599
will be also very passive.
 

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:48.456
So you will find things which
are electrically very active

00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:50.309
with loose electrons in the
upper,

00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:52.929
called valence states,
and the inner shells are

00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:54.340
filled,
they are not.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.750
They are inert.
 

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.711
So the behavior of active,
inert, active,

00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:00.018
inert is periodic,
and that's the periodic table

00:53:00.018 --> 00:53:01.050
that is observed.
 

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:04.052
But you get that from quantum
mechanics in great detail by

00:53:04.052 --> 00:53:07.211
solving for the energy levels,
then using the Pauli principle

00:53:07.211 --> 00:53:09.630
to put only 1 electron there
every quantum state,

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:14.739
and you can see a lot of this
behavior can be anticipated.

00:53:14.739 --> 00:53:16.782
So anyway, these are things you
will learn if you learn

00:53:16.782 --> 00:53:18.070
chemistry, if you learn physics.
 

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.929
You will see where everything
comes from.

00:53:20.929 --> 00:53:24.659
All right, so this is the end
of the quantum mechanics part.

00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:29.371
I'm just going to tell you that
I want to stop here and I'll see

00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:31.840
you for the discussion section.
 

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.592
I'm really going to miss my
Mondays and Wednesdays because

00:53:34.592 --> 00:53:36.670
for me, that's the best time of
the week.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.969
So really good to be with you
guys.

00:53:38.969 --> 00:53:39.780
Thank you.
 

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.000
&gt;
 

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000

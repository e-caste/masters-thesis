00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:02.267
PAUL FREEDMAN: We're
going to talk about

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.467
monasticism today.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:11.600
And monasticism in the popular
imagination, and accurately,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.167
is linked to learning.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:16.933
We all have this image of
monks quietly copying

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:22.733
manuscripts, and those
manuscripts being how the

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.533
learning of the ancient
world was transmitted.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.567
We're going to talk a little
more about that when we come

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.133
to near the end of the course on
intellectuals in the court

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.500
of Charlemagne.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.967
But monasticism and learning
are linked in our mind, but

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.800
they are not intrinsically
linked.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.767
There is no logical reason why
monks should copy manuscripts.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.300
They should pray.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.933
They should live in some kind of
renunciation of the world.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.667
Generally speaking in the
medieval West, they live in

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.167
communities.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:59.600
Generally speaking, they are
engaged in a kind of corporate

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.433
rather than individual prayer.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:05.800
All of these things follow
from the way

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.433
monasticism was conceived.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:12.067
And the major text, though not
the only one, but the most

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:15.867
influential text about how
monasticism is conceived, was

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:20.233
the sixth century Rule
of Saint Benedict.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:25.667
The Rule of Saint Benedict has
some possible references to

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.467
sacred reading as it calls
it, or to some kind

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:33.800
of program of knowledge.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.867
It assumes that the monks are
literate, for example, a lot

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.633
to assume at that time.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.800
But nowhere does Benedict say,
"Please preserve the classical

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.833
tradition by being scribes and
writing and the Scriptorium."

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:52.300
So how does this come about, is
one of the problems that we

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.467
will deal with.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.700
But what we're really interested
is monasticism

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.800
without the learning.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.733
And the reason we're interested
in that is not only

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:05.600
is this the prevailing spiritual
movement of the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.867
early Middle Ages, but it has
a tremendous influence on

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:14.567
society outside the
monastic walls.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.900
Because central to our
discussion is a paradox.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.833
The paradox is that while the
monks are trying to escape the

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.433
world, the world is
following them.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.733
The world is very interested
in their prayers, because

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:37.433
their prayers are thought to
have a powerful real-world,

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.833
this-world, effect.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.933
So as the monks become more
distant from society, God

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:47.333
hears their prayers with
more and more sympathy.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:52.400
Therefore their prayers have
a kind of power, a power to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.633
benefit others.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:58.133
This notion of power is
like some kind of

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.233
almost electrical utility.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:03.133
They're building up an
incredible amount of

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.033
electricity, if you want to
call it that, or let's say

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:10.333
spiritual energy to
be more accurate.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:15.867
Way more than they need; way
more than they can consume.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:22.067
They're like some little Persian
Gulf state that is

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:25.000
producing ten percent
of the world's oil.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.533
There's no way they can
use all of that.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:32.967
In this case then, how does the
surplus get distributed?

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:36.300
It gets distributed through
the generosity of people

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.433
outside the
[correction: monastic]

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.867
world worried about the
condition of their souls.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:45.400
The notion that I, possessor
of spiritual reserves and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.800
spiritual power, can pray for
you, sinful knight, sinful

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.467
king, sinful merchant, is
called intercession.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:03.033
The notion that I can
intercede for you--

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.500
and we've already seen
this, haven't we?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.600
We've seen this with the saints
in Gregory of Tours and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.867
in other texts.

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:14.967
We've tried to emphasize how
important the saints are, not

00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:18.900
just for our understanding of
medieval religion, but for our

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.200
understanding of medieval
society.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.733
Remember that I tried to
emphasize that one of the

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:27.167
problems, once you're done with
the Roman Empire, is how

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.133
society is held together.

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:30.867
In the Roman Empire,
it's pretty clear.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.333
It's held together by
institutions that, although

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:39.467
not the same as our own, are
translatable to our own: law,

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:47.867
administrative structure, land
holding, the whole panoply of

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:50.200
what passes for civilized
life.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.700
But in the early Middle Ages,
after the collapse of the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.467
Roman Empire, we've seen the
society does not have as much

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.767
literacy, does not have
very good records.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.800
The kings are thugs.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600
The political order
is very unstable.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.333
There's an awful
lot of warfare.

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.800
There's a lot of disorder.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.433
You can't just dial 9-1-1
and expect a response.

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.000
So the question then
becomes what holds

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.233
that society together?

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:23.033
And we mentioned some things,
including the Church.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:26.733
And here we're looking at a
particular instance of how

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:27.333
that works.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:32.433
Because the monks, far from
being kind of out there in the

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:37.300
forest or desert or some remote
region, or even if they

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.600
are in the forest or desert and
some remote region, are

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.433
extremely important to how
society functions.

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.867
Because this is a society in
which the spiritual, the

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:53.700
military, the political, the
economic, are not easily

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.300
conceptually separated.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.167
This is the Middle ages, OK?

00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:00.533
You love the Middle
Ages, otherwise we

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:01.700
wouldn't be here together.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.800
But this is the part of the
Middle Ages that is perhaps

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.867
most medieval.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.633
What could be more medieval
than monasticism?

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:14.533
When I started teaching, which
wasn't that long after the

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:18.800
Middle Ages, but when I started
teaching, monasticism

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.833
was a real problem, because
it was so alien.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.367
What are these people doing?

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:28.433
In a way the situation is
better, because monasticism is

00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:33.333
sort of chic, at least temporary
weekend monasticism.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.433
People think of monasteries
sort of like spas.

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:37.967
You go there to get cleansed.

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:42.333
In fact a lot of monasteries
have taken on a lot of new

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:46.900
business with retreats, and
detoxification, and

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.200
pilgrimage, and these
kinds of concepts.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.100
But at the same time, while I
think we understand the desire

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.433
to renounce the world or to take
time off from the world

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:05.233
or to leave the personal digital
devices at home and

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:11.533
think about something for more
than three seconds at a time,

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:12.733
all of this is temporary.

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.567
The whole point of
detoxification is that you

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:20.767
then go and re-toxify yourself
or go back to normal life.

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:22.933
What we have to understand
here are people who have

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:29.567
decided to embrace a
world-renouncing

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:33.733
way of life for good.

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.933
Now monks therefore,
are clergy.

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:41.333
They are professional members
of the Church.

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.633
But they're not priests.

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:45.767
It's key that you understand
the difference.

00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:49.767
Priests interact
with the laity.

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:55.133
Layman, laity, are people who
are ordinary people, believers

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:58.233
but not clergy.

00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:06.200
The priests interact with the
laity through mass, the

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.300
performance of the sacraments,
things like baptism, a little

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:18.400
bit later than this period,
confession,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.633
anointment of the sick.

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:26.400
These are things in which the
sacred is conveyed from the

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.900
spiritual world to laypeople
via priests.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.533
Priests are in that sense the
intermediaries between the

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:40.667
divine and the material.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:44.367
But because priests are involved
in the world, there

00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:47.867
are certain aspects of their
differentiation from the

00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:50.700
world, and there's a lot of
debate in the Church at

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.700
various times over whether that
includes celibacy, not

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.167
getting married.

00:08:56.167 --> 00:08:59.267
In the era that we're dealing
with, there are married

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:05.300
priests, or there are priests
who are more or less married.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.433
And then there are priests
who are celibate.

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:10.800
But monks are not supposed to
interact with the world.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.000
They are leading a life of
contemplation and self-denial.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.600
True, they cannot focus only
on their own salvation.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600
Because that would
mean ignoring the

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.300
Christian's duty to others.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.700
One of the problems about being
a contemplative in the

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.867
Christian tradition is as soon
as you say something like,

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:39.667
"Boy, I am really contemplating
great today."

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:43.733
Or, "Wow, I am really seeing
the mysteries of the

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:47.200
universe." Or, "I can't believe
I haven't had anything

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.167
to eat or drink for three days
and am feeling great."

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:52.300
You are falling off.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.267
You're falling away.

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:53.967
You're selfish.

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:56.867
You're taking pride in your
own accomplishments.

00:09:56.867 --> 00:10:01.700
So from the beginning is the
notion that the monks have to

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.067
abandon everything, including
self-satisfaction.

00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:10.033
In fact even most importantly
self-satisfaction.

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:14.433
And this is where Benedict's
notion of humility comes from,

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:17.333
which is very strong in The
Rule of Saint Benedict.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.500
Where does this desire
to rid oneself of

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.733
the world come from?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.167
It's very strong in
Christianity.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:34.033
It's all over the
New Testament.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:37.033
That is actually part of
the Christian message.

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.467
It's awkward, because most
people don't follow that,

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:42.900
including most people
who are believers.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.933
They don't in fact give away
everything they have to the

00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:53.133
poor and follow Christ. They
don't renounce the pleasures

00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:56.367
of life, of the flesh,
and so forth.

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.733
But that is sort of what they
are telling you to do.

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:08.100
The first monk, the first guy
who we know of to decide to

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.933
run away to the desert and lead
a life of contemplation

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:12.833
is Saint Anthony of Egypt.--

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:14.467
Well Anthony, you know
how to spell that.--

00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:17.700
He lived from 251 to 356.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.333
I have trouble believing this.

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:21.700
The sources are pretty good.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:27.867
I have trouble believing that
anybody could live to be 105

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.200
in the Roman Empire.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.233
Or indeed, at any time before
ten years ago or so.

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:37.467
But there it is.

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:43.600
At least we know that in 270,
he heard the saying of Jesus

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.300
in a Church: "Go sell all you
have. Give to the poor and

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.067
follow me." And he followed
this literally.

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:56.400
He established himself as a
solitary hermit in Egypt.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.867
And Egypt is a great place for
monasticism, because Egypt has

00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:08.600
a very narrow strip of
incredibly fertile land on

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.367
either side of the Nile.

00:12:10.367 --> 00:12:14.433
The Nile, which until the
building of the Aswan Dam,

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.100
flooded every year.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.733
And its silt, that it brought
down from its sources, was so

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:26.367
rich that it created this
marvelous soil on which all

00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:27.633
sorts of things could grow.

00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:32.533
But once you got beyond that
limit, you were in the desert.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:38.367
So you have absolute and total
really Sahara-like desert,

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.933
very close to fertile land,
the best land of the

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.667
Mediterranean.

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:45.867
So that you could have a kind
of interaction between--

00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:48.733
I mean, it's not like you decide
that you want to be a

00:12:48.733 --> 00:12:51.033
hermit and you live
in Manhattan.

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:53.900
And you drive and you drive and
you drive, and you get to

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.400
Long Island, and you're in the
suburbs, and then you're in

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.200
the ex-urbs.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.767
And then you're in sort of gas
stations and strip malls.

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:01.433
And then you're in
the Hamptons.

00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:02.867
It's very, very hard--

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:07.300
I mean you can, actually, if
you go north, pretty soon

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.833
you'll get if not hermit
country, at

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:13.500
least a decent isolation.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.833
Of course the problem with New
York is that it's really cold.

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:23.533
It's great to be a hermit
in September.

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:27.767
But the Adirondack hermitages
present

00:13:27.767 --> 00:13:30.200
problems in the winter.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.067
Egypt is hot, all right,
but certainly no

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:35.967
exposure to cold problem.

00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:37.833
Anyway, the first monks
are in Egypt.

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:40.467
And they are known as
the Desert Fathers.

00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:43.800
Often, they live alone as
hermits, but sometimes they

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.633
live in communities.

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:48.367
They have their own cells in
these communities, but they

00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:52.533
can come together for prayer or
for some sort of spiritual

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:53.767
companionship.

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:59.400
What's interesting is that right
from the start, these

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.700
hermits or first monks, appealed
to the people who had

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.833
no plans to become monks.

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:10.800
They appealed to the people of
the cities of Alexandria or

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.367
Thebes, etc.

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:13.633
of Egypt.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:23.600
The reason is, and the reason
why people would become monks,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.200
is the establishment of the
Church as the official church

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.033
of the Roman Empire.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:32.533
There are no monks in the first
years of Christianity,

00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:37.200
because just being a Christian
means denying the world.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.333
The threat of death at the hands
of the Roman authorities

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:46.933
and the illegality of the
religion means that you are

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:51.633
already in a world-renouncing
position.

00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:54.533
But once the church becomes
established, once all sorts of

00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:57.300
people start joining it for
motives that have nothing to

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.233
do with spiritual reasons, or
maybe ten percent spiritual,

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:07.167
ninety percent it's time, my
career, I want my kids to grow

00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:10.900
up in the sort of right faith.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:18.333
Then those of real spiritual
bent, devotion, desire, have

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:24.433
to present themselves as more
than merely attending church

00:15:24.433 --> 00:15:28.800
as serious about Christianity
in some sense.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.467
So monasticism has to be
understood in its earliest

00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:39.633
years as a reaction against the
compromises and comfort of

00:15:39.633 --> 00:15:41.633
official Christianity.

00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:48.267
And we see this in Augustine's
Confessions.

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:51.800
Where, you will recall, the
emotional crisis that finally

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.733
tipped Augustine over the edge
into his conversion experience

00:15:55.733 --> 00:16:00.633
was hearing about the monks of
Egypt from someone who had

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:06.633
come to Milan and had been in
Egypt, and described these men

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:12.900
and actually women who were
not well-educated were

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.533
certainly not trained in
rhetoric, law, and the

00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:22.133
classics to the extent
of Augustine.

00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:26.667
Yet nevertheless, they had in
Augustine's words, "stormed

00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:31.533
the gates of heaven." They
had by their spiritual

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:37.300
renunciation hence their
spiritual power, become close

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.867
to God in ways that he,
Augustine, and his friends

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:43.700
with all their knowledge,
had not.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.967
And this contrast is what
decides Augustine to embrace a

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:52.067
way of life that although not
monastic and much more active

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.733
in the world, is a renunciation
of the standard

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.933
career, the standard definitions
of success in the

00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:03.533
Roman Empire, and involvement
in the world in things like

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:08.933
marriage, property
owning, etc.

00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:13.267
So in fact, if the monks are
these not very well-educated

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:19.833
people, if embracing their
values means giving up Cicero

00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:24.800
and the classical tradition, it
looks as if monasticism is

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.733
an anti-intellectual movement.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:30.167
We've come back to this paradox
of the monks as

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.000
custodians of learning.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.900
It's not quite the fox as the
protector of the hens, but it

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:44.000
is not automatic that the monks
would find themselves in

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.533
the position of copying
down Cicero.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.400
So the first forms of
monasticism are those of the

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.267
Egyptian desert.

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:03.100
There's a kind of tension from
the start between ascetic

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.900
individualism and collective
monasticism.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.800
Ascetic individualism means
one person engaging in

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.500
practices that dramatize the
renunciation of the world.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.900
A classic example is not from
Egypt but from Syria.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.433
These are the saints who sit
on top of pillars for

00:18:25.433 --> 00:18:28.800
decades at a time.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.467
Individual, right?

00:18:30.467 --> 00:18:34.867
They're alone on this pillar,
maybe it's this wide, or maybe

00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:40.233
this wide at the top, thirty
feet high, fifty feet high.

00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:43.967
These saints collectively
are known as Stylites.

00:18:43.967 --> 00:18:45.867
A "stylite" is a pillar.

00:18:45.867 --> 00:18:48.800
And the most famous of them,
Saint Simeon of the Desert, or

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:56.933
Saint Simeon Stylites, lived on
top of this pillar for what

00:18:56.933 --> 00:18:58.267
is it, thirty-five years?

00:18:58.267 --> 00:18:59.767
Something like that.

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:05.833
Thirty-five years up there,
in the rain, in the sun.

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:08.367
Imagine the sanitary
arrangements.

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:10.567
Imagine this.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:14.400
I mean this is world
renunciation.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.500
But he was not alone.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.200
He was alone on top
of the pillar.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.533
He was a hermit.

00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:22.567
But people came and
visited him.

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:26.767
There are pictures of ladders
going up to him, people

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:29.167
climbing these ladders,
sometimes delivering a little

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:32.267
message: "Would you pray for
my child who is dying of"--

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:34.767
well I don't know what
he's dying of.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.400
Asking for things in the world:
"Please deliver me from

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.033
a bankruptcy;" "Please deliver
me from illness;" "Please

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:50.933
protect me on this voyage."

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:52.667
Why don't they ask
God themselves?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.933
Save a trip to the desert
out of Antioch?

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:02.200
Save perhaps a donation to
the Saint Simeon Stylites

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.067
Foundation?

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:09.333
Because God is going to listen
to Simeon, right?

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.600
Why?

00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:15.433
STUDENT: Because he's worthy
to speak to him.

00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:17.267
PROFESSOR:
And why is he worthy?

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:19.967
What has he done to make
himself worthier?

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:22.433
You're quite right.

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:24.100
He's renounced the world.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.267
STUDENT: And he knows Latin.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.267
He's not unbelievably
cultivated, probably

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:32.833
Syriac in this case.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.967
Probably those notes
are in Syriac.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:41.167
But his world renunciation has
imbued him with power.

00:20:41.167 --> 00:20:43.933
This is not unique to
Christianity, right?

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:50.100
Shamanism, the idea of a person
who is an outcast in

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.567
society, or who has
renounced the

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:56.167
normal comforts of society.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:59.033
What's the problem with just
getting married, having kids,

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:01.333
having a job?

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:02.567
Wondering what's for dinner?

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:08.967
From the Christian
point of view.

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:12.767
That's what most practitioners
are doing.

00:21:12.767 --> 00:21:14.933
STUDENT: You're focusing on
the world and not on the--

00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:16.700
PROFESSOR: You
have to focus on the world.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.767
Supposing you wake up one
morning and say, "I'm going to

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:21.533
be a much more spiritual
person." And then there's

00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:26.133
wailing from your kids, and
your spouse is nagging you

00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:29.433
about fixing the dripping
faucet.

00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:31.300
I mean this is stuff
you've got to look

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.100
forward to, most of you.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.300
I don't expect you to
go into monasteries.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.867
But this is a distraction from
what the New Testament

00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:41.833
tells you to do.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:44.900
The New Testament doesn't
say, "Go ahead.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.500
Be happy.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.367
Amass property.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:47.733
Get a great job.

00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:49.367
Make a lot of contacts.

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:52.467
Get ahead Have a bunch
of children.

00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:54.667
Get them into good schools.

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:57.567
Get them coaches for
the SAT's." And so

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.433
forth and so on.

00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:04.067
If you have done that, because
you just got trapped-- well,

00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:07.233
one thing led to another
and here you are.

00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:09.833
If insofar as you have spiritual
anxieties and

00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:11.600
desires, then you're going
to want to have a patron.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.333
You're going to want to have
someone who can intervene with

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.833
you, just like way back when
you had somebody write a

00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:21.033
letter recommendation because
they were on the board of some

00:22:21.033 --> 00:22:25.533
company, or they had
some influence.

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:28.500
Here your patron is a spiritual
patron, and it is

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.833
monks or hermits.

00:22:31.833 --> 00:22:38.633
So the role of the holy man in
society is of somebody who has

00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:44.100
a heroic ability denied to
most ordinary people.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.633
This is a spiritual superhero
who, like comic book

00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:53.533
superheroes, isn't just a
superhero for his own benefit.

00:22:53.533 --> 00:22:56.367
He doesn't just fly around
because he likes the sensation

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:57.967
of flying around.

00:22:57.967 --> 00:23:01.900
But who helps those who
are weaker than him.

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:06.233
And the intervention
of somebody--

00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:10.333
a very important Saint like
Simeon Stylites, transcended

00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:13.933
the merely curative.

00:23:13.933 --> 00:23:19.133
Simeon was without fear of
the emperor, for example.

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:21.467
What could the emperor do to him
that was worse than living

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:25.267
at the top of a pillar,
after all?

00:23:25.267 --> 00:23:28.600
The emperor Constantius, one of
the sons of Constantine in

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.700
the early fourth century, was
going to punish the city of

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.200
Antioch for defying the
tax collectors.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.800
Tax had been collected
in Antioch.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.033
There'd been a riot.

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:40.900
Lots of people were killed.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.333
Normally, you'd expect the wrath
of the emperor to come

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:50.367
down on the city and punish
it very severely.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:53.933
Simeon was able to intervene
with Constantius to prevent

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.367
this from happening.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.900
Constantius listened to
him because he was a

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.033
little scared of him.

00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:06.333
People are a little scared of
those who are not only not

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:12.100
playing the game, but who are
playing a different game

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.100
according to unique and very
difficult to imitate rules.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.667
So there's a paradox here.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:24.367
Again, as the withdrawal from
society becomes more dramatic,

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:28.000
the imputed spiritual power
becomes greater.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.767
If Simeon's renunciation
were limited to

00:24:30.767 --> 00:24:37.900
something kind of small.

00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:44.567
Suppose he became a vegan.

00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:48.300
Would people believe
in his power?

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.100
And then this brings up the
question of, then, what is the

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.867
power of The Rule of
Saint Benedict?

00:24:54.867 --> 00:24:57.267
If you read The Rule of Saint
Benedict, there's nothing in

00:24:57.267 --> 00:25:00.133
there about living outdoors
all the time at

00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:01.400
the top of a pillar.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.200
There's nothing about
extreme asceticism.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.533
Yet Benedictine monasticism
would prove more durable than

00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:09.533
pillar sitting.

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:12.600
It would prove more durable than
the desert saints even.

00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:27.067
Monasticism was brought to the
West in several forms. But

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:29.800
generally speaking, although
there are lots of hermits, we

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.867
hear more about the communities
of monks.

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:37.267
Monks who live in an
establishment.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.100
And beginning in the late sixth,
and particularly in the

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.833
seventh century, a lot of
monasteries were established

00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:51.700
in rural parts of Europe,
rural or small

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.867
town parts of Europe.

00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:59.267
Places like St. Albans
in England, which is

00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:01.733
not far from London.

00:26:01.733 --> 00:26:08.800
Or Bede's monastery of Jarrow
in Northumbria, more remote.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.933
Or Fulda in Germany.

00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:22.800
Reichenau, a monastery in
southwestern Germany on a

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.933
little island in
Lake Constance.

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:32.900
These monasteries owned
property, and indeed many of

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.467
them became very rich.

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:39.033
Because one way of affiliating
yourself with a monastery was

00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:46.567
to give to them, to donate land,
money, serfs, coins,

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:47.833
booty, whatever.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.033
And the reason people donated is
because of the violence of

00:26:55.033 --> 00:26:56.600
their lives.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.733
The people who had the stuff to
donate usually had gotten

00:26:59.733 --> 00:27:00.767
it by violence.

00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:04.000
Because it's a society that, as
you've seen in the pages of

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.600
Gregory of Tours particularly
but not exclusively, it is a

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600
society organized
around warfare.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.733
All of these guys in Gregory
of Tours have

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:16.100
blood on their hands.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.133
You cannot be successful without
a certain amount of

00:27:21.133 --> 00:27:24.667
the infliction of pain
on other people.

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:28.300
And although the rich and
wealthy in any society do not

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:35.767
believe themselves to be rich
and wealthy for vicious

00:27:35.767 --> 00:27:38.633
reasons, indeed the rich and
wealthy generally speaking

00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:40.433
think they're great.

00:27:40.433 --> 00:27:43.233
In this society, the rich and
wealthy think they're great

00:27:43.233 --> 00:27:47.000
all right, but they're
also very anxious.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.467
It's not just a question of,
what is the phrase that's

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:53.933
often used by donors to
universities, "give back to"

00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:56.533
Yale, for example, or give
back to society.

00:27:56.533 --> 00:27:58.800
It's not just a question of
giving back to society: "Yes,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.700
I made $40 billion, so I feel
I need to give back

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.967
something." It's a question
of, "I'm going to hell.

00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:08.367
What can I do?

00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:12.367
I know I'm going to hell,
because I killed 80 people in

00:28:12.367 --> 00:28:16.000
the course of just
business deals.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.333
The closing of this deal
required that 10 people be

00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:28.267
killed." Or 500, or 2,000.

00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:31.800
So there is a symbiosis,
to be cynical about it.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.333
And as you know, I'm not really
a very cynical person.

00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:35.500
I hope that has come through.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.700
I hope it's come through
that I'm a really

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.700
idealistic, even naive.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.767
But if you'll forgive a moment
of cynicism, there is a

00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:49.267
symbiosis between the monks,
who are amassing this huge

00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:53.033
quantity of spiritual energy,
and the leaders of society,

00:28:53.033 --> 00:28:56.433
who are amassing this huge
quantity of sins.

00:28:56.433 --> 00:28:58.933
It's a natural trade
agreement.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.033
So there are paradoxical

00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:04.500
consequences of monastic wealth.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.033
As these places get richer and
richer, they become too

00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:13.633
important to the kings, the
leaders of society, just to be

00:29:13.633 --> 00:29:18.233
left to a bunch of weird,
world-renouncing hermits.

00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:25.600
They start to be administered
by people who themselves are

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.967
from high families,
of high lineage.

00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:34.667
In order to become a monk at
Fulda or Reichenau, you can't

00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:37.600
just wander in and say, "I'm
renouncing the world." You've

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.433
got to be from a good family.

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:44.600
You've got to come with
an endowment.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.933
Generally speaking to get into
Reichenau as a monk, the

00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:54.400
family's going to have to pay
a huge amount of property,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.567
money, some form of wealth
that endows that monk.

00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:06.867
So at some point maybe people
will stop believing that

00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:09.467
Reichenau is such
a great place.

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:13.700
Maybe they'll stop believing
in its spiritual energy.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.233
This would happen later.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:19.100
But not yet.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:19.600
Not yet.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.733
The preservation of the
monasteries and their growth

00:30:23.733 --> 00:30:28.833
and success is due to the
rule of Saint Benedict.

00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:31.467
The most important development
of Western monasticism--

00:30:31.467 --> 00:30:34.433
and there are all kinds of
other monasticisms in the

00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:35.267
Christian world.

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:38.867
But the monasticism that would
characterize Western Europe is

00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:42.900
the rule of Saint Benedict,
late sixth century, who

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.533
devised a set of regulations
for communal monasticism.

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:57.500
So The Rule of Saint Benedict
is a manual for the monastic

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.000
life, how to set up and
run a monastery.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.167
It's not the first. It's
based on an older rule.

00:31:06.167 --> 00:31:09.100
We don't have to go into sort
of who is responsible for

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.667
inventing Benedictine
monasticism, as it's called.

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:16.733
But the monasteries of the West
would be for the most

00:31:16.733 --> 00:31:19.933
part Benedictine until the
twelfth century, when you

00:31:19.933 --> 00:31:21.867
start to have other orders.

00:31:21.867 --> 00:31:24.567
That is, there would be
thousands of monasteries

00:31:24.567 --> 00:31:25.600
throughout Europe.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.500
And they would follow more
or less the rule

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.767
that you have read.

00:31:34.167 --> 00:31:35.933
Why is this rule
so successful?

00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:42.133
For one thing, it is moderate.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.867
It is reproducible
on a large scale.

00:31:44.867 --> 00:31:47.767
It is ascetic, all right.

00:31:47.767 --> 00:31:50.033
It does involve giving
up a lot of things,

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:52.333
but not to an extreme.

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:57.467
Not to be compared to the life
of a desert hermit or a desert

00:31:57.467 --> 00:31:59.000
pillar-sitter.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.633
Or the harsh monasticism
of the Irish tradition.

00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:09.133
You don't have to go to some
little island that's one

00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:12.633
square kilometer large and out
in the middle of the windy

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:16.000
Irish sea, and build
some little beehive

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.633
hut and live there.

00:32:18.633 --> 00:32:21.433
Ascetic monasticism of
the extreme sort is

00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:22.433
all over the place.

00:32:22.433 --> 00:32:24.767
Because hostile environments
are all over the place.

00:32:24.767 --> 00:32:28.567
Now it's not as if Benedictine
monasteries are all located in

00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:31.533
cheerful, hilly, fertile
countryside.

00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:33.667
But a lot of them are.

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:38.700
A lot of them are located
in productive land.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.133
But more important than that,
they require a certain kind of

00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:44.900
asceticism.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.500
The asceticism of a Benedictine
monastery is

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.667
renunciation of self in favor
of the community.

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:59.067
In that sense, it's almost an
opposite of the kind of

00:32:59.067 --> 00:33:03.233
monasticism that hermits or
pillar saints practice.

00:33:06.233 --> 00:33:09.300
What's ascetic about a
Benedictine monastery is not

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:15.300
only the celibacy part, or the
prayer part, or the isolation

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.400
from worldly stimulus part, but
the fact that you're not

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.233
alone most of the time.

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.233
You have to subordinate
your will to

00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:28.967
communal rituals and life.

00:33:28.967 --> 00:33:31.833
You have to subordinate your
will to the abbot.

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:37.300
Remember how much Benedict
emphasizes obedience.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.400
This is not just a good
management tool for making it

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.967
clear who's in charge.

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:49.267
It is a form of self-abnegation,
a form of

00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:51.767
renunciation.

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:59.867
Benedict also enjoins
manual labor.

00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:03.433
This is a penitential tool.

00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:06.367
But it's also something that
has perhaps something to do

00:34:06.367 --> 00:34:09.000
with the economic success
of these foundations.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.433
These are monks who are engaged
in primarily two

00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:14.833
activities, labor and prayer.

00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:21.167
Prayer, we'll talk about in
a moment And is quite

00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:21.833
understandable.

00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:25.500
But labor is more interesting
and innovative.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.933
Because the ancient world
despised labor.

00:34:29.933 --> 00:34:34.500
The whole idea of how you should
live in pre-conversion

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.633
Augustine's opinion, which
reflects that of late Roman

00:34:37.633 --> 00:34:44.100
society, is what was called
leisure with dignity.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.500
Leisure with dignity is what
most professors aspire to.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:56.433
That is to say, leisure but not
just to take naps and play

00:34:56.433 --> 00:35:03.400
with your dog or surf various
dubious sites on the internet.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:10.467
Leisure, to read, to think, to
engage in a kind of genteel

00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:13.167
contemplation.

00:35:13.167 --> 00:35:16.633
And this is the ideal of those
Roman senators who were

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:18.067
writing philosophical
dialogues.

00:35:20.767 --> 00:35:27.200
But work, actual work, is
degrading, horrible in the

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.900
ancient world.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.067
Not to be engaged in by anybody
who could call himself

00:35:34.067 --> 00:35:36.200
a gentleman.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.133
So by making people work,
including people who come from

00:35:39.133 --> 00:35:42.033
the upper classes, this is a
penitential labor indeed,

00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:44.567
particularly labor
with your hands.

00:35:44.567 --> 00:35:49.633
Though other kinds of labor
were envisaged.

00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:53.167
In Section 48, Benedict
talks about

00:35:53.167 --> 00:35:56.000
labor and sacred reading.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.700
And this is one of those places
where you can draw out

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.267
from its meaning that
copying manuscripts

00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:03.833
is a form of labor.

00:36:03.833 --> 00:36:05.700
Reading texts is a
form of labor.

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:14.300
So the transformation, or at
least the addition of learning

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.367
as part of the mission statement
of monasteries, is

00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:20.300
implicit here, but certainly
not drawn out by Benedict.

00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:26.133
Prayer.

00:36:26.133 --> 00:36:29.433
One of the things that is
involved in this surrendering

00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:33.167
of your will to the greater
communal good is the

00:36:33.167 --> 00:36:34.533
performance of prayers.

00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:41.233
Benedict emphasizes humility.

00:36:43.733 --> 00:36:48.067
The monk's life as a
ladder of humility.

00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:54.167
Humility is encouraged by
obedience, silence.

00:36:54.167 --> 00:36:56.000
In Benedictine monasteries,
you weren't

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.667
silent all the time.

00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:02.867
But there is a discouragement
against mere chatter.

00:37:02.867 --> 00:37:06.233
Labor, all of these are
penitential activities in

00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:08.500
which the individual
will is suppressed.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.900
And if you think of experiences
in which the

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.100
individual will is suppressed so
that the person focuses on

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.500
the community, we are all
familiar, in fact you are more

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.900
familiar than I am probably,
more immediately, with such

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.667
activities.

00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:30.767
Any kind of training or boot
camp-like thing, or a senior

00:37:30.767 --> 00:37:37.400
society, or an a capella group,
makes you do stuff with

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.267
the group that may be
unpleasant, difficult,

00:37:41.267 --> 00:37:43.633
self-sacrificing, but
that reinforces

00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:45.200
the esprit de corps.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.900
This is the heart
of the military.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.600
Military beats you up
in order to make you

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.100
focus on the group.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.933
And many other organizations,
including businesses, this

00:37:56.933 --> 00:38:01.200
idea of going out into the
mountains and turning you

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.833
loose with a tent and some rope
and seeing which groups

00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:09.000
are able to survive, or
whatever they do.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.267
This is part of this
kind of training.

00:38:11.267 --> 00:38:13.200
It's not just to train you into

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.700
depending on other people.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.967
It's to train you into focusing
on the success of the

00:38:18.967 --> 00:38:21.800
organization or group as
opposed to your own

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.033
aggrandizement.

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:26.533
The difference again is, you
come back from the little

00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:28.100
upward bound experience.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.033
Or you come back from
the retreat.

00:38:30.033 --> 00:38:32.333
Or you come back from
the scavenger hunt.

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:35.200
In this case, this
is your life.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:41.600
But in addition to obedience,
labor, silence, prayer is the

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.900
most important renunciatory
activity.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.800
Because these are not just
prayers like, "OK, I'm going

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.467
to go in for five minutes and
recite some prayers." These

00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:57.133
are prayers that go on all
day with some breaks.

00:38:57.133 --> 00:39:03.033
One of psalms seems to suggest
that you should make prayers

00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:05.900
seven times a day.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.400
So they begin a little
bit after midnight.

00:39:10.967 --> 00:39:13.100
Then they go to sleep
for a little while.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.667
And then they get up a little
before dawn and they pray.

00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.867
And then they go back to sleep
for a little while.

00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:24.200
And then they have a kind of
early morning session, and so

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.833
forth and so on, seven
times a day.

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:32.200
And these are prayers they go
through the psalms primarily.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.467
Different monasteries have
different liturgies.

00:39:37.467 --> 00:39:41.700
A liturgy is a kind
of ritual cycle.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.033
Some monasteries have more
prayer and less contemplation,

00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:50.033
or less prayer and more work.

00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:53.400
But they all are engaged in
the performance of group

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.933
prayers, not individual
but the community.

00:39:57.933 --> 00:40:00.500
And these go on and on and on.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.067
And they take on a kind of
rhythm or a monotony, or a

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:11.433
kind of visionary power that's
such experiences can convey.

00:40:11.433 --> 00:40:15.300
And it is these prayers that are
what are really storing up

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.067
those spiritual reserves
I was talking about as

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.733
characteristic of monasteries.

00:40:20.733 --> 00:40:24.433
There's this tremendous power
that all these repeated

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:28.667
prayers have that cannot be
duplicated outside the walls

00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:30.667
of the monastery.

00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:33.567
So this heavy round of prayer
involves a significant

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:38.233
sacrifice of comfort
and of the self.

00:40:38.233 --> 00:40:40.267
This is a kind of sleep
deprivation.

00:40:40.267 --> 00:40:44.367
Monks never really quite make
up the sleep deficiencies.

00:40:44.367 --> 00:40:48.967
They sort of stagger into
Matins, as the first hours are

00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:53.967
called, or Lauds, the
pre-sunrise hour.

00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:56.300
But this is very impressive
to the outside world.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.900
The outside world, the
donors, love this.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.700
They love the buildup
of these prayers.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.167
And they would like the prayers
to take place in a

00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:06.167
nice place.

00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:08.433
Rather than having the monastery
church being some

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:15.200
kind of dank or fire trap wooden
structure, they'll

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.733
build beautiful churches for
them and beautiful dormitories

00:41:18.733 --> 00:41:19.800
for them as well.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.833
And beautiful refectories
for them.

00:41:24.367 --> 00:41:27.933
If you're a donor, you would
rather that the stuff that

00:41:27.933 --> 00:41:32.967
you're donating for take place
in nice surroundings.

00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:35.967
Donors like it if the lawns
at Yale are well-clipped.

00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:41.467
And I think I've said
this before.

00:41:41.467 --> 00:41:47.467
The closest thing to a monastery
is a college, with

00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:50.133
some obvious differences.

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:52.767
But communal living?

00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:58.933
The quadrangle is like the
cloister focused in on itself.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.900
The emphasis on the group.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.267
Identification with
the institution.

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:07.000
The notion that your activities

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.133
will benefit society.

00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:13.067
Not so much your prayers, but
all that great research we're

00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:14.333
allegedly doing.

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.567
OK.

00:42:17.567 --> 00:42:23.400
The parallel does not
carry perfectly.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.967
But it is no accident that this
university looks a little

00:42:26.967 --> 00:42:28.500
bit like a monastery.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:36.567
It is to evoke a tradition of
contemplation, isolation.

00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:39.000
People speak about the Yale
bubble, but it's supposed to

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.067
be a bit of a bubble.

00:42:40.067 --> 00:42:42.933
It was constructed that way.

00:42:42.933 --> 00:42:44.700
That is the ideal.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.567
Now you may not have chosen to
go to the places that really

00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:53.267
reproduce the monastic ideal.

00:42:53.267 --> 00:42:56.433
I went to the University of
California at Santa Cruz.

00:42:56.433 --> 00:43:00.333
It was like up on a hill in a
redwood forest. That was sort

00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:01.433
of like a monastery.

00:43:01.433 --> 00:43:05.100
Or Earlham College
in Indiana, or

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.733
Marlboro College in Vermont.

00:43:07.733 --> 00:43:10.067
I know you rejected these
places, I know you just

00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:12.567
laughed at them just thinking
about going to them.

00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:17.233
But there are people who've
decided to go-- no?

00:43:17.233 --> 00:43:19.000
Devastated that you didn't
get into Earlham?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.967
Well, OK.

00:43:20.967 --> 00:43:26.700
But this is an American ideal
that is similar to the

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.800
monastic ideal.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.767
It is a sort of renunciatory
ideal.

00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:33.533
And it is an ideal
of learning.

00:43:33.533 --> 00:43:34.967
So how do we get to learning?

00:43:34.967 --> 00:43:37.767
In the last few minutes I
just want to trace these

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:39.333
connections.

00:43:39.333 --> 00:43:42.133
The Benedictine Rule, as you
will have noticed, does not

00:43:42.133 --> 00:43:43.933
encourage learning.

00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:47.033
And Benedict himself did
not regard this as a

00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:48.733
primary duty of monks.

00:43:48.733 --> 00:43:51.567
He did expect the monks
to read the Bible.

00:43:51.567 --> 00:43:54.200
He expected them to
listen to readings

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.367
from the Church Fathers.

00:43:56.367 --> 00:44:03.133
And very key, he says that the
monks should take out a book

00:44:03.133 --> 00:44:06.233
from what he calls
the bibliotheca.

00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:08.233
"Bibliotheca" is the Latin
word for library.

00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:21.633
It's not clear when monasteries
had libraries.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.700
But really the idea of
collecting books and copying

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:35.800
them comes from late Roman
culture, from a desire to

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:45.233
understand the Bible and from a
transformation of that world

00:44:45.233 --> 00:44:48.833
of cultivated leisure, where
the intellectuals like

00:44:48.833 --> 00:44:51.767
Augustine and his mentors,
were the custodians of

00:44:51.767 --> 00:44:56.100
learning, to a world in which
the clergy and particularly

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.967
the monastic clergy, were the
custodians of learning.

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:06.267
Because the monks had three
key elements: They had

00:45:06.267 --> 00:45:08.267
learning, that is they
were literate.

00:45:08.267 --> 00:45:11.233
They had time, even though the
prayers consumed a lot,

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:12.367
they're not in the world.

00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:14.300
And they had wealth.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.467
It's not inevitable that time,
learning, and wealth should

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:21.900
lead to a cultural
efflorescence.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.367
But they are certainly
favorable conditions.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.367
So I leave you with that
implication of the rule.

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:34.200
We will develop it further
in a few weeks.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.200
What we're going to be talking
about beginning on Monday of

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.433
next week is Islam.

00:45:39.433 --> 00:45:47.100
So we are moving into a
different post-Roman reality.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.333
Thanks.

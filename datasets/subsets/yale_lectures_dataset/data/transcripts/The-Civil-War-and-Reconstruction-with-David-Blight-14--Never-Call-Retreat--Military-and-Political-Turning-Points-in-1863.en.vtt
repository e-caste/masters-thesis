00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.296
Professor David Blight:
The person whose writing drew me

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:23.910
into the Civil War--and I
confess--was Bruce Catton.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.620
Have any of you ever read any
of Bruce Catton?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.947
Ah.
It's a dwindling number in the

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.874
twenty-first century.
But when I was growing up Bruce

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:39.469
Catton was the great narrative,
popular historian--or popular

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.610
narrative historian--of the
Civil War.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.315
He wrote some seven books or
so, from the late 1950s through

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:53.445
the 1960s into the '70s.
He wrote them around the time

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:57.392
of the Civil War centennial.
He was not an academic

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:01.025
historian, he was a journalist
and a former war correspondent

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:06.307
in the Second World War,
and the man had a beautiful

00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:12.278
sense of narrative.
This is Catton from his book

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:17.181
Terrible Swift Sword,
which is 1862,

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:21.500
the year of 1862 of the Civil
War.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.623
He's trying to capture the
situation, the strategic

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:32.239
situation, the emotional,
sentimental situation,

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:39.751
the mood of already war-weary
America, a little more than a

00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:44.934
year into this thing;
which is where we're going to

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:48.010
go, and a little bit further,
in a moment.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.987
He's talking,
though, essentially,

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:53.102
about the most important
argument I think we can make

00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:55.975
about that first year,
year and a half,

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:58.690
into the second year of the
war.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.569
Both sides wanted a limited war.
Remember that.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.663
On the Confederate side they
just wanted to fight long enough

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:15.756
to make the North or the Federal
Government acknowledge their

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:18.900
independence.
The longer the thing went on,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.360
the more dangerous it was,
of course, for the Confederacy.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.787
They were out-manned,
out-numbered,

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:29.720
they had lesser resources,
et cetera.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.669
On the northern side,
it was the stated policy of the

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.620
Lincoln Administration to keep
this a limited war;

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.612
and a great deal more on this
next week when we deal with the

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:42.184
emancipation story.
The whole idea again,

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:44.589
for Lincoln,
was to keep this from becoming,

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.826
as he put it,
a remorseless revolutionary

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:50.873
struggle.
That is exactly what it had

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:57.136
become by the summer of 1862.
And here is Catton's

00:02:57.136 --> 00:03:01.166
description;
I can't do it any better:

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:06.819
"There was nobility in the idea
that there ought to be a peace

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.513
without victory.
By August of 1862,

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:16.852
America's tragedy was that it
was caught between the madness

00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:23.620
of going on with the war and the
human impossibility of stopping

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.227
it.
Secession had been a direct

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:32.009
result of the outcome of the
Election of 1860.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.291
To restore the status quo would
be to assume that either the

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.240
North or the South had had a
great change of heart,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.629
that the North would not again
go Republican,

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.789
or that the South would quietly
acquiesce if it did.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.980
Neither Mr.
Lincoln nor Mr.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.110
Davis was going to assume
anything of the kind.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.750
Each man was fighting for a
dreadful simplicity.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.997
Neither one could describe a
solution acceptable to him,

00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:06.167
without describing something
wholly unacceptable to the

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:09.041
other.
Neither man could accept

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:13.596
anything less than complete
victory without admitting

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:17.839
complete defeat.
Both sides had heard the

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.029
trumpet that could never call
retreat.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.449
The peacemakers could not be
heard until the terrible swift

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.434
sword had been sheathed.
But the scabbard had been

00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:34.844
thrown away and now the
Confederacy was carrying the war

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:37.170
into the enemy's country."

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.924
Well, "never call retreat" is
of course a very warlike

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:54.009
language, but this was an awful
and horrible war.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.701
Now Lincoln,
of course--and you've read now

00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:00.097
some documents on this,
and if you've started to watch

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:03.412
the Ken Burns film series,
which by the way is now up on

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:05.910
the Classes Server,
it is up on the Classes Server;

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.227
well no it's up on CDigix but,
as Sam Schaffer just informed

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.521
me, if you go to the Classes
Server there is a

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:17.546
message--what's it called--under
Information?--and under

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:21.514
Announcements,
it tells you exactly again how

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.152
to use the URL.
Have any of you already tapped

00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:27.360
in?
Okay.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.549
Make sure you watch episodes
two and three,

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:34.574
through the one entitled
"Forever Free," maybe by this

00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:38.600
weekend, certainly by the
beginning of next week.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.408
At any rate,
in that film series you'll see

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.401
that Burns chose to make George
B.

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.391
McClellan a kind of comic
relief--his vanity,

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:53.110
his arrogance,
his insubordination,

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.728
his almost incredible,
if complex, hatred of Abraham

00:05:57.728 --> 00:06:03.071
Lincoln, Edwin Stanton and all
the leadership of the Federal

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:07.689
Government that he was
commanding the Army for.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.892
Lincoln wanted a strategy in
the wake of Bull Run,

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:16.009
the disaster at Bull Run that
summer, in July.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.041
He puts McClellan in charge of
the Army of the Potomac,

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.019
as I said the other day.
McClellan takes them into huge

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:23.486
encampments all around
Washington, DC,

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:26.312
and began in August,
September, October,

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:29.033
and through the fall,
to drill this Army,

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:32.199
train it.
And they came to love him;

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.451
that is, all these green,
young soldier boys from all

00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:40.048
over the North,
and they were arriving now in

00:06:40.048 --> 00:06:43.629
whole new regiments,
week after week after week,

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.629
all formed in local communities
across the North.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.079
The vast, vast,
vast majority of them had never

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:57.269
shouldered any kind of musket in
their lives except possibly in a

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:00.413
local militia,
and only a tiny percentage of

00:07:00.413 --> 00:07:03.767
them had ever been in a militia.
They actually grew to kind of

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.979
love McClellan at first because
he held great parades,

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.242
great parades.
He made them march like hell

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:11.617
and train like hell and learn
how to march sideways and

00:07:11.617 --> 00:07:14.170
forward and backward and retreat
and do all that stuff.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.220
But man, when he held a parade
it was cool.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.360
They also hadn't seen any war
yet.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.345
He didn't move the army.
Lincoln wanted him to move it

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:27.401
that fall, go back into
Virginia, go find that

00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:31.185
Confederate Army again,
find it on the right ground

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:34.550
somewhere, attack it,
end the war.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:41.382
Not going to happen.
This young, 35-year-old general

00:07:41.382 --> 00:07:46.598
was a very cautious soul.
"Who would've thought that I

00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:49.710
would be called up to save my
country?"

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.866
said McClellan.
And we have those amazing

00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:56.080
letters he kept writing to his
wife, over and over and over.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.717
"I am called to save my country.
These buffoons in Washington

00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:03.939
don't know what they're doing.
Stanton is an idiot."

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:08.699
And at one point he called
Lincoln "a baboon."

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:13.500
That actually got into the
public.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.234
He was also--make no mistake,
and it's very important,

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:22.878
especially when we get into
'62--he was a pro-slavery

00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:25.786
Democrat.
He was the farthest thing you

00:08:25.786 --> 00:08:29.040
could imagine in the Union Army
from an abolitionist.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.773
McClellan wanted nothing to do
with the remorseless

00:08:30.773 --> 00:08:33.944
revolutionary struggle.
He did not want to move huge

00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:38.964
armies into Virginia or into the
South, into densely populated

00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:43.820
slave areas, because he did not
want to destroy slavery.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.690
He saw that as a revolution no
army could somehow control.

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.753
He even wrote that fall to a
democratic congressman and said,

00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:57.469
"You must help
me"--quote--"help me dodge the

00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:01.600
nigger";
which was the way he put it.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.980
By January, Lincoln was
impatient, to say the least.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.006
McClellan caught typhoid fever
and was really quite sick for

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:16.202
most of a month and refused to
even answer Lincoln's messages,

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:19.007
at times.
This President of the United

00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:22.341
States, the Commander-in-Chief,
is sending him messages,

00:09:22.341 --> 00:09:25.494
couriers, and for days
McClellan wouldn't even answer

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:27.904
him.
And then there's the famous

00:09:27.904 --> 00:09:31.289
message that Lincoln sends in
February, I believe,

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:34.283
of '62;
sends a message to McClellan

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:38.396
and says, "General,
if you're not going to use your

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:40.700
army, might I borrow it?"

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.566
Let's move out West,
as the war is going to break

00:09:51.566 --> 00:09:56.609
out all over the West,
whether anybody wanted it to or

00:09:56.609 --> 00:10:00.700
not, whether anybody planned it
or not.

00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:09.311
I'll get the outline back up
there in case you

00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:12.770
didn't--sorry--get to see it.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.015
I don't know if you can see all
this in the back row but I hope

00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:34.267
you can see enough to understand
that what we have here is the

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.940
region of Alabama,
Mississippi,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:42.190
Tennessee, Kentucky and over
into Missouri,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.516
Arkansas and so on.
The war broke out in the West

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:52.848
and is essentially a river war,
a river war for the Tennessee

00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:56.580
and the Cumberland Rivers in
Tennessee.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.644
Now you only need to look at a
map with one eye open to

00:11:00.644 --> 00:11:05.009
understand how important
Tennessee would be in this war.

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:09.009
If Kentucky has still not
seceded from the Union,

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:13.259
and officially will not,
and if Kentucky remains any

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:17.408
kind of buffer for the Union,
Tennessee is where the war is

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:18.903
going to be fought,
in the West,

00:11:18.903 --> 00:11:20.880
certainly at first--and it
surely was.

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:29.271
Now, at first the war in the
West was essentially fought with

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:33.830
gunboats, little ironclad
gunboats, and armies on the

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.103
land.
But the first major conflicts

00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:42.669
in the West were to try to hold,
on the side of the Confederacy,

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.949
and to take,
on the northern side,

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:51.316
two forts, one called Fort
Donelson and one called Fort

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:53.673
Henry;
one on the Cumberland,

00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:57.024
one on the Tennessee River.
These rivers were terribly

00:11:57.024 --> 00:12:00.252
important for transportation
now, especially military

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:04.572
transportation.
They flowed down to Nashville,

00:12:04.572 --> 00:12:07.842
one of them.
The other flowed southward and

00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:12.284
then into Northern Georgia.
These rivers would be invasion

00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:17.115
corridors, if you like,
invasion paths for the Northern

00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:19.181
armies.
They were extremely important

00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:21.039
for supply and transportation,
for the South.

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:26.559
And hence these relatively
small forts that guarded these

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:32.669
two rivers suddenly became the
focal point by February 1862.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.253
The Union forces that would
attack Fort Henry first,

00:12:36.253 --> 00:12:40.837
and then Ford Donelson,
were commanded by a young,

00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:46.819
only in his early forties,
General who had been promoted

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:52.769
rapidly from Colonel,
named Ulysses S. Grant.

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:57.676
Now Grant, as many of you may
know--well, Grant has had a huge

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:02.019
revival in scholarship in the
last, oh, two decades.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:06.556
He was for a long time all but
forgotten in American history,

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:10.866
partly because his presidency
was so awful--and we'll deal

00:13:10.866 --> 00:13:14.722
with that later on in the
course--or in some ways so

00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:17.806
awful.
He got miserably depressed and

00:13:17.806 --> 00:13:22.160
took to drinking--that part's
true--when he was stationed way

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.990
out in California in the
late-1850s.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.394
He was a bit of a drunk in
those years and he resigned from

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:34.247
the army.
He'd been a veteran of the

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:39.031
Mexican War, decorated,
but he quit the army,

00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:41.553
bored,
depressed, and he went back to

00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:44.433
Illinois, his home--well born in
Ohio but he went back to

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:47.316
Illinois--and he was working,
as the story goes,

00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:50.546
it's not a legend,
in his brother's leather shop

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:53.727
in Galena,
Illinois when the Civil War

00:13:53.727 --> 00:13:56.356
broke out.
And because he was a West Point

00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.529
graduate and the only one
around, they named him Colonel,

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:04.402
and he led the regiment that
was formed from that area of

00:14:04.402 --> 00:14:11.653
northwest Illinois,
and off to war went Ulysses

00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:14.915
Grant.
Ulysses Grant is a classic

00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:18.983
example--and I want to give you
an illustration of this--a

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:23.985
classic example of an American,
or an American male,

00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:29.522
for whom most of the rest of
life, business,

00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:35.059
profession--except for
horseback riding,

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:38.390
and he was a hell of a
horseman-- almost everything

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.920
else in his life had been a
failure or near failure or

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.173
simply boring.
He'd grown up on farms but he

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:52.737
hated farming.
He's a classic example of how

00:14:52.737 --> 00:14:57.759
sometimes war,
tragically or unfortunately,

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:02.397
can make a person.
Were it not for the American

00:15:02.397 --> 00:15:05.816
Civil War you'd have never heard
of Ulysses S.

00:15:05.816 --> 00:15:07.687
Grant.
This is Bill McFeely's

00:15:07.687 --> 00:15:10.606
description;
William McFeely who has written

00:15:10.606 --> 00:15:14.394
the finest biography of Grant I
think still ever done,

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:17.039
although there've been many
since.

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:21.068
And he's describing Grant's
situation in Galena and how

00:15:21.068 --> 00:15:24.500
bored he was and depressed he
was and so on.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:31.532
And then McFeely writes:
"War, the ordinary man's escape

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:36.008
from the ordinary.
It was a way out of a leather

00:15:36.008 --> 00:15:39.249
store, and for some men it is
much more than that,

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:43.086
it is the fulfillment that the
world will yield in no other

00:15:43.086 --> 00:15:44.746
manner.
For these men,

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:48.524
war appears as a refutation of
evil, whether it be the evil of

00:15:48.524 --> 00:15:52.116
Hitler's threat to Marc Bloch's
France or the slaveholders'

00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:57.371
threat to Thoreau's America,
or less exalted but no less

00:15:57.371 --> 00:16:02.009
real, the evil of personal
hollowness.

00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:06.533
War, for a man like Ulysses
Grant, was the only situation in

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:11.210
which he could truly connect to
his country and countrymen and

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.702
be at one with them and himself.
Grant did not like the

00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:20.113
vainglory of victory or the
drama of high strategy or the

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:24.306
blood of battle,
and he did not think that all

00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:29.421
wars were worth fighting,
yet some essential part of his

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:33.419
being was brought into play only
in war.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:37.120
He never celebrated this fact,
but neither did he deny it.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.993
He knew it was true.
Only in war,

00:16:39.993 --> 00:16:44.363
and possibly at the end of his
life in writing about the war,

00:16:44.363 --> 00:16:48.149
in what would be the greatest
memoir of this war,

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:55.194
did he find the completeness of
experience that when engaged in

00:16:55.194 --> 00:17:02.561
it so intensely moved him."
Well, Grant was a soldier and,

00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:09.482
not unlike Robert E.
Lee, he did enjoy the spirit of

00:17:09.482 --> 00:17:12.829
battle;
I don't think there's any doubt

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.816
about that.
And he moved on these forts,

00:17:15.816 --> 00:17:19.457
first Fort Henry,
February 6, with about 15,000

00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:23.890
men on land and a bunch of slow,
cumbersome gunboats.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.765
Fort Henry was not well
defended and basically just

00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:30.948
surrendered.
A week later on the other

00:17:30.948 --> 00:17:35.313
river, the Cumberland,
Fort Donelson was shelled into

00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:39.888
submission by artillery.
This was the second week of

00:17:39.888 --> 00:17:43.649
February 1862,
and Grant famously demanded an

00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:48.950
unconditional surrender from
General Simon Bolivar Buckner,

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.450
who had been Grant's roommate
at West Point.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.853
There's a wonderful exchange of
their dispatches that you can

00:17:55.853 --> 00:17:58.519
read if you want to look it up,
easy to find.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:02.740
Grant writes to Buckner and
says, "Hello friend,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:08.307
you will surrender all of your
forces and all of your guns or I

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:13.139
will move on you immediately."
And Buckner writes back and

00:18:13.139 --> 00:18:15.315
says, "Well now,
well now Ulysses,

00:18:15.315 --> 00:18:18.202
can we talk?"
Grant writes back and says,

00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:19.791
"No."
[laughter]

00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:24.869
And of course the press will
pick this up;

00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:26.653
U.S.
Grant will become

00:18:26.653 --> 00:18:30.868
"Unconditional Surrender" Grant.
The significance of Forts

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:34.164
Donelson and Henry were not only
symbolic, because the Northern

00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:36.611
press picked this up,
waiting for war--God,

00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:39.789
months and months and months
had gone by since Bull Run.

00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:41.279
There'd been various
engagements.

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:45.009
The armies were growing all
over the country.

00:18:45.009 --> 00:18:47.731
Men were going off to war and
writing letters home to their

00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.420
mothers, sweethearts and
families.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.110
Here was some real war and some
Union victory and a hero.

00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:59.607
Most importantly,
strategically though,

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:02.534
the city of Nashville,
capital of Tennessee,

00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:05.529
had to be abandoned by the
Confederates;

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:14.009
they could no longer defend it,
and they did abandon it.

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:16.690
It was partly a strategic
retreat and partly out of the

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.369
reality they didn't have enough
people to defend it.

00:19:19.369 --> 00:19:23.231
And a Confederate Army
beginning to grow now--and this

00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:27.748
is into the spring of 1862--as
thousands more southern boys and

00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:32.700
men would leave those farms,
in hundreds of regiments from

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.585
Mississippi, Alabama,
Louisiana and Texas in

00:19:36.585 --> 00:19:39.918
particular.
They will come to join the Army

00:19:39.918 --> 00:19:43.855
of Albert Sidney Johnston who
led the small Confederate Army

00:19:43.855 --> 00:19:47.916
out of Nashville,
down southwestward into

00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:53.726
Southwest Tennessee,
just across the border to the

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:57.519
town of Corinth,
Mississippi.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:00.406
And it was around Corinth,
Mississippi,

00:20:00.406 --> 00:20:05.041
in the northeast tip corner of
the State of Mississippi that a

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:08.079
huge Confederate army was
assembled.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:14.275
Now, Grant was now put in
command of all Union forces,

00:20:14.275 --> 00:20:17.742
all over Tennessee.
Grant, though,

00:20:17.742 --> 00:20:20.706
had no idea,
really, what the Confederates

00:20:20.706 --> 00:20:24.177
were going to do,
and what happened at the Battle

00:20:24.177 --> 00:20:28.009
of Shiloh was not only the first
major horrible,

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:31.354
bloody battle of the war,
and it would shock the country,

00:20:31.354 --> 00:20:34.339
but it was a total surprise to
the Union forces.

00:20:34.339 --> 00:20:37.180
Put simply, here's what
happened.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.599
Albert Sidney Johnston had
about 40,000 troops at Corinth,

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:44.779
Mississippi,
and Grant had at his disposal

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:49.319
about 60,000 troops.
These are still not the size of

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:54.680
the armies that will begin to
unfold in the East in Virginia.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:03.039
But Grant had his army split in
two, and widely apart.

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:05.365
About one-third of it was under
the command of a general named

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.720
Don Carlos Buell,
and he was in central

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.609
Tennessee, Grant's forces were
sort of more western Tennessee,

00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:16.944
and both were slowly trying to
move down toward southwestern

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:20.837
Tennessee and maybe even into
Mississippi to find this

00:21:20.837 --> 00:21:26.350
Confederate Army,
in March and early April of '62.

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:33.285
What happened was that Albert
Sidney Johnston attempted a

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.726
surprise attack,
and it was one of the most

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:39.329
successful surprise attacks by
these large unwieldy armies that

00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:43.480
ever happened in this war.
He marched his men twenty

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.976
miles, most of it in darkness,
with all kinds of clothing and

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:54.839
burlap used as muffling on the
wheels of caissons and wagons;

00:21:54.839 --> 00:22:01.009
even men were told to put
muffling on their boots.

00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:06.961
And they marched through night
in the dark, April 5 to 6,1862,

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:10.627
north from Corinth,
across the border into

00:22:10.627 --> 00:22:15.039
Tennessee, and they attacked a
remnant, a sizeable remnant,

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:19.568
of Grant's forces that had just
reached a place called Pittsburg

00:22:19.568 --> 00:22:23.737
Landing, or Shiloh Church as
it's known--it's a tiny little

00:22:23.737 --> 00:22:26.924
village.
And what happened on the first

00:22:26.924 --> 00:22:31.727
day at Shiloh was the bloodiest
day of the war until that point

00:22:31.727 --> 00:22:34.885
in time.
Grant's troops were literally

00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:38.633
caught with their pants down.
They had no pickets out,

00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:41.700
they had no idea where the
Confederate Army really was,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.200
nor especially that they were
that close.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.563
There are many famous
descriptions of this in

00:22:47.563 --> 00:22:51.670
soldiers' letters and diaries,
and afterward by Ambrose Bierce

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.938
especially, of how this sneak
attack had caught them literally

00:22:54.938 --> 00:22:57.670
around their tents in the
morning making coffee,

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.630
some of them without their
pants on.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:06.039
The first day at Shiloh was a
complete Confederate victory.

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:09.383
It drove the Union forces right
back to the river,

00:23:09.383 --> 00:23:12.726
the Tennessee River,
and by the time Grant and one

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:16.445
of his other generals,
William Tecumseh Sherman,

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:20.804
arrived that night they found
remnants of this completely

00:23:20.804 --> 00:23:25.163
defeated Union force hiding on
the banks of the Tennessee

00:23:25.163 --> 00:23:27.860
River,
many of them having lost their

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.050
regiments, lost their command,
lost their officers,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:38.202
didn't know where they were.
Through the dark of night April

00:23:38.202 --> 00:23:42.092
6 to 7, it was especially
Sherman and other officers--as

00:23:42.092 --> 00:23:46.335
Don Carlos Buell's 20,000 men
arrived at Shiloh in the middle

00:23:46.335 --> 00:23:49.660
of that night--Sherman and other
officers,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.495
literally at times,
whipped Union soldiers into

00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:59.119
order, tried to help men find
their units.

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:04.303
And when dawn came the next day
they counter-attacked across the

00:24:04.303 --> 00:24:08.582
same fields in savage
hand-to-hand combat that all of

00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:13.190
these soldiers had never
experienced and never seen.

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:22.438
And by the end of it they
completely reversed the first

00:24:22.438 --> 00:24:25.901
day's action.
The Battle of Shiloh took place

00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:29.440
in an area about a mile to a
mile and a half in diameter,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.666
and by the end of the second
day, as Grant famously put it in

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:37.893
one of the very few moments in
his two-volume memoir where he

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:42.190
ever kind of really broke down
and described the carnage,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.506
he said, "I could've walked
across that field as far as the

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:50.896
eye could see and never touched
the ground by walking on the

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:54.145
bodies."
For the two armies in

00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:59.530
forty-eight hours there were
23,841 casualties;

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.210
23,841 casualties.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:16.731
Now, Shiloh strategically was a
Union success in the simple fact

00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:27.039
that the Confederate Army had to
retreat back into Mississippi,

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:30.374
and did not succeed in
re-entering Tennessee and

00:25:30.374 --> 00:25:33.069
opening up a new front in
Tennessee,

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:36.190
or taking control of the
Tennessee River in that region.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.925
But it was truly a shock to the
country when these casualty

00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:41.329
lists came back and were
published in newspapers,

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.606
and when the adjutants of
regiments--which was the job of

00:25:45.606 --> 00:25:50.340
an adjutant in a regiment was to
record the casualties and send

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.115
them home.
And it was, of course,

00:25:53.115 --> 00:25:56.915
that site where Grant
remembered realizing for the

00:25:56.915 --> 00:26:01.645
first time--and I had that quote
up here the other day and you

00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:04.980
can read it in Gienapp--where he
said,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.317
"It was at that moment I
realized that this war could

00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:12.103
never--that the Union could
never be preserved without" what

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:15.120
he called "complete conquest of
the South."

00:26:18.349 --> 00:26:24.378
That's what Bruce Catton meant
about how the scabbard was being

00:26:24.378 --> 00:26:27.968
thrown away.
It was now a war where no one

00:26:27.968 --> 00:26:32.554
would ever call retreat.
Now, back east,

00:26:32.554 --> 00:26:41.970
back to the melodrama between
McClellan and Lincoln.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.510
No, that's not the one I want,
excuse me.

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:56.839
I think you can see enough of
this, I hope.

00:26:56.839 --> 00:27:00.946
Now McClellan throughout that
winter kept training,

00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:04.970
training, and training the Army
of the Potomac.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.935
And he did train them in to
what many military historians

00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:13.254
still say was one of the most
efficient and certainly the best

00:27:13.254 --> 00:27:16.369
supplied armies the world had
ever seen.

00:27:16.369 --> 00:27:22.164
He would have almost 100,000
troops--he'd have 90,000 in the

00:27:22.164 --> 00:27:26.289
field--100,000 troops under his
command.

00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:31.059
And he came up with a plan that
Lincoln hated;

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:32.526
Edwin Stanton,
Secretary of War,

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:35.372
didn't like it;
officers around him didn't

00:27:35.372 --> 00:27:39.759
particularly like it.
But it was McClellan's idea.

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:44.119
McClellan did not want to
invade Virginia from the north.

00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:49.232
He thought it would be a better
idea to sail the entire Army of

00:27:49.232 --> 00:27:53.933
the Potomac down the Potomac
River out into Chesapeake Bay

00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:58.468
and land on the peninsula
between the York and the James

00:27:58.468 --> 00:28:01.689
Rivers in Virginia,
and invade Virginia,

00:28:01.689 --> 00:28:04.529
toward Richmond,
the capital of the Confederacy.

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:08.046
Take the enemy's capital,
was his aim here--a strategy

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:11.431
eventually that Ulysses S.
Grant is going to tear to

00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:15.280
shreds, and quickly realize,
as he was realizing out in the

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.503
West,
that the Confederacy was its

00:28:18.503 --> 00:28:22.065
armies--not its capital,
not a city here,

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:25.911
a town there.
The idea was to land this huge

00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:30.028
flotilla of an army on the coast
and march it sixty,

00:28:30.028 --> 00:28:34.710
seventy miles inland and attack
Richmond from the east.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.974
Now, part of the theory here
was that the Confederacy had

00:28:37.974 --> 00:28:41.413
been fortifying the north side
of Richmond but maybe not the

00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:44.065
east side.
Now, it's no surprise folks,

00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:48.063
if you float 90,000 people down
the river and land them on the

00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:51.210
coast that you might be coming
from the east.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.280
Lo and behold.

00:28:57.009 --> 00:28:59.004
But this is where--I don't want
to make McClellan into just

00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:01.929
comic relief like Burns does;
I think he overdoes it--but

00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:05.440
here it is important to
understand that generals did

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.769
have impact on this war.
It was not that McClellan had a

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:15.470
personal distaste for battle
necessarily;

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.016
those charges that he was
somehow a coward and all that,

00:29:18.016 --> 00:29:19.730
I don't think that holds up at
all.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.134
But he did not like huge
general engagements,

00:29:24.134 --> 00:29:30.039
he did not want to sacrifice
any more men than he had to.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:34.836
And remember,
he doesn't want the war to

00:29:34.836 --> 00:29:39.432
become remorseless.
He put the town of Yorktown,

00:29:39.432 --> 00:29:43.961
on the coast--the same Yorktown
where Cornwallis had surrendered

00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:47.842
to George Washington in the
American Revolution--he put

00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:50.789
Yorktown under siege when he
landed,

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:54.072
for an entire month,
from April 5 to May 4,

00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:58.918
because McClellan was convinced
that he was confronted with far

00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:03.616
more men than he really was.
At one point McClellan actually

00:30:03.616 --> 00:30:08.151
wrote a dispatch to Secretary of
War Stanton claiming that he was

00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:12.190
facing on the peninsula at least
200,000 Confederates.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.684
There weren't 200,000
Confederates under arms anywhere

00:30:16.684 --> 00:30:18.720
in the South,
in 1862.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.210
But McClellan was always
overestimating his enemy.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.579
He hired the Pinkerton
detectives.

00:30:25.579 --> 00:30:28.420
He hired this guy named Lowe
with his balloons;

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.259
this was the first use of
balloons in warfare.

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:34.200
They'd float these things up in
the air and they'd go and they'd

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.906
float over the enemy and they'd
try to count the forces and

00:30:36.906 --> 00:30:39.566
they'd hope the wind was right
to float them back and land

00:30:39.566 --> 00:30:41.607
them.
They were pretty cumbersome,

00:30:41.607 --> 00:30:43.773
awful;
and one time the thing floated

00:30:43.773 --> 00:30:47.339
and it crashed in the other side
of the Confederate troops.

00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:51.955
He was getting his intelligence
from all these new modern ways,

00:30:51.955 --> 00:30:55.826
and every time he got
intelligence it's apparent that

00:30:55.826 --> 00:31:00.069
McClellan would just start doing
some multiplication.

00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:01.960
Oh, and there's so many stories
about this;

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.917
I'll spare you.
He didn't need to put Yorktown

00:31:05.917 --> 00:31:08.529
under siege for a month,
he could've taken it in 48

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:10.763
hours.
The Confederates had built a

00:31:10.763 --> 00:31:13.407
lot of fortifications,
huge fortifications,

00:31:13.407 --> 00:31:16.430
but they didn't have very many
men behind it.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:22.197
And where one officer might see
one Confederate in a

00:31:22.197 --> 00:31:27.400
field-glass, McClellan would see
five or 10.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.787
Given this caution,
given this slowness,

00:31:31.787 --> 00:31:38.200
the Confederate command in
Richmond sent the young General

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.825
Stonewall Jackson with about
20,000 men over to the

00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:47.200
Shenandoah Valley,
here.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.677
While McClellan had landed this
massive army on the peninsula

00:31:50.677 --> 00:31:52.880
and it was slowly beginning to
move,

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.768
they send Stonewall Jackson
with an army of about 20,000 men

00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:58.549
to the Shenandoah Valley,
where Stonewall Jackson

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:01.912
conducted one of the most famous
military campaigns in

00:32:01.912 --> 00:32:05.592
history--and they still teach
this in minute detail at West

00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:07.631
Point.
Actually he only had about

00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:10.282
17,000 men.
The purpose of this was to

00:32:10.282 --> 00:32:14.581
throw fear into northern
Virginia, fear into the capital

00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:18.023
at Washington,
and to keep about 30,000 Union

00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:22.319
troops in Northern Virginia,
that McClellan had left behind.

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:25.739
The idea here was that
McClellan would move from the

00:32:25.739 --> 00:32:28.420
east, 30,000,
roughly, Union troops would

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.791
move from the north,
and they would crush Richmond

00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:34.404
from two sides,
and the war would be over by

00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:37.204
July.
The Confederates saw this and

00:32:37.204 --> 00:32:42.187
they said, all right.
Jackson spent the period April

00:32:42.187 --> 00:32:45.630
29 to June 5,
five weeks roughly,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:51.009
marching all up and down the
Shenandoah Valley,

00:32:51.009 --> 00:32:53.565
driving his men to utter
exhaustion, twenty and

00:32:53.565 --> 00:32:56.970
twenty-five miles a day.
He fought five major battles,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.026
marched 400 miles in those five
weeks, fought lots of kind of

00:33:01.026 --> 00:33:03.551
contact,
rearguard actions,

00:33:03.551 --> 00:33:09.390
eluded three different Union
armies or parts of Union armies

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.067
at various times,
threw fear into Washington,

00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:16.335
kept the 30,000 Union troops
all occupied in Northern

00:33:16.335 --> 00:33:20.082
Virginia and Western Virginia,
and then escaped,

00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:25.295
back down the valley and back
to Richmond, by the time

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:29.251
McClellan attacked.
It was an extraordinary

00:33:29.251 --> 00:33:33.850
campaign.
It made Stonewall Jackson's

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.468
fame.
Now, the first major contact

00:33:37.468 --> 00:33:43.499
finally between the Union forces
and Confederate forces on the

00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:49.529
peninsula came at a place called
Seven Pines or Fair Oaks.

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:54.430
It's a place about some six,
seven miles east of Richmond.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:59.921
It would be the first major
bloody affair for this Army of

00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:03.593
the Potomac.
And I want to describe it for

00:34:03.593 --> 00:34:07.680
you by simply reading excerpts
from a few letters,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.391
of a Union soldier,
leading up to the moment of his

00:34:12.391 --> 00:34:15.937
first major battle.
And I want to do this in part

00:34:15.937 --> 00:34:18.585
because we need to
understand--and we'll come back

00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:21.126
to this question a bit
later--that what a common

00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:24.099
soldier out there in the field
understands about what is

00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:27.170
happening is,
of course, almost always a blur;

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:31.949
it's the fog of war that he
sees.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:36.217
I had the opportunity about,
oh God, fifteen years ago now,

00:34:36.217 --> 00:34:40.632
to edit a collection of Civil
War letters that were lopped in

00:34:40.632 --> 00:34:44.826
my lap by a young soldier from
Massachusetts named Charles

00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:47.816
Brewster.
Charlie Brewster was a store

00:34:47.816 --> 00:34:51.117
clerk in Northampton,
Massachusetts when the Civil

00:34:51.117 --> 00:34:54.726
War broke out in April of '61.
He was 27-years-old,

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.360
he felt like a total failure in
life.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.019
He was not yet married.
He had nothing going on.

00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:05.512
And he enlisted as fast as he
could in the 10^(th)

00:35:05.512 --> 00:35:08.506
Massachusetts,
and he spent that whole fall

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:12.421
and winter of '61/'62 in camp.
And I will mention Charlie

00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:14.601
again next week,
because Charlie was no

00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:17.719
abolitionist,
trust me, but he comes to

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:22.822
realize through this experience
that the war has to destroy

00:35:22.822 --> 00:35:27.243
slavery.
It's an interesting model of

00:35:27.243 --> 00:35:31.807
the average Yankee.
But he wrote incredible

00:35:31.807 --> 00:35:35.909
letters, always to his mother or
his sister.

00:35:35.909 --> 00:35:42.794
He writes this on May--Battle
of Fair Oaks or Seven Pines

00:35:42.794 --> 00:35:47.750
occurred on May 31 of 1862.
He knows a big battle's coming.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.990
They don't know exactly where
or when.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.956
It is raining like hell.
He's sleeping in the mud on

00:35:54.956 --> 00:35:59.427
what he calls a rubber blanket.
He gets diarrhea that nearly is

00:35:59.427 --> 00:36:02.170
killing him, and he will almost
die of diarrhea twice in this

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.464
war.
But he keeps writing to his

00:36:04.464 --> 00:36:07.135
mother.
And one morning the rain has

00:36:07.135 --> 00:36:11.380
stopped and he tells her what a
beautiful morning it is.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.030
"Mother, I wish you could see
what a splendid morning this is.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.391
The trees are in full foliage
and the birds are singing in the

00:36:20.391 --> 00:36:24.110
trees and the water ripples and
sparks at my feet,

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.340
with the sun shining gloriously
over all.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.448
And if it were not for the
regiment I see before me,

00:36:30.448 --> 00:36:33.800
each with his deadly end-field
rifle on his shoulder,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:40.100
I could hardly imagine that
there was a war anywhere in the

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.565
land."
Now, day by day--he writes

00:36:44.565 --> 00:36:49.960
every day to his mother,
long letters.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.409
Some of these letters
handwritten were fifteen to

00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:57.075
twenty page letters,
and he wrote about 240 of them,

00:36:57.075 --> 00:37:02.214
in the course of the war.
May 22, in a clover field,

00:37:02.214 --> 00:37:06.913
he says: "Dear Mother,
it is just sunset,

00:37:06.913 --> 00:37:12.552
a most beautiful day,
though it has been dreadful

00:37:12.552 --> 00:37:15.411
hot.
I was relieved this morning

00:37:15.411 --> 00:37:18.880
from my guard duty,
at General Keyes' headquarters,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.653
and joined the regiment and
immediately took up my line of

00:37:21.653 --> 00:37:24.486
march with them.
We came on about two miles,

00:37:24.486 --> 00:37:28.687
or perhaps not quite as far as
that, and bivouacked in this

00:37:28.687 --> 00:37:32.594
field.
It's the best place we have had

00:37:32.594 --> 00:37:36.131
since we left Warwick.
Our small brigade is in the

00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:37.960
advance and we go out on picket
frequently.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.869
We do not know anything of what
is going on in the world outside

00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:46.014
of our camp.
How I wish I could see a late

00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:48.665
paper.
We've got a rumor that there's

00:37:48.665 --> 00:37:51.611
been a battle out in Corinth,
Mississippi,

00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:55.060
and that Beauregard and 23,000
men are prisoners,

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.150
but I presume there is no truth
in it.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.271
Our artillery had a skirmish
last night, in a swamp in the

00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:05.429
front.
We're expecting a great battle

00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:10.501
Mom, but I reckon that Little
Mac will make his dispositions

00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:15.659
for it and the chivalry"--which
means the South--"will take a

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:20.560
distant view of his preparations
and then skedaddle,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.162
as usual.
If they don't they will get a

00:38:24.162 --> 00:38:27.576
terrible licking,
though it is reported that they

00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:31.416
are concentrating everything
there and have got 140,000

00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:33.878
troops.
A contraband"--meaning an

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:37.482
escaped slave--"that came in
yesterday says that they are

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:40.700
talking terrible fierce about
burning Richmond,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:48.650
fighting over the ashes.
But I think that's all bosh."

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.929
Thursday morning,
May 23: "On picket," he says.

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:56.637
"Dear Mother,
Captain and myself slept under

00:38:56.637 --> 00:39:00.414
the same blanket last night and
on the ground in front of the

00:39:00.414 --> 00:39:03.556
muskets,
and it was harder than

00:39:03.556 --> 00:39:08.223
Pharaoh's heart.
But it promotes early rising,

00:39:08.223 --> 00:39:11.584
for it's now 7 a.m.
and I've been up for three

00:39:11.584 --> 00:39:12.020
hours."

00:39:16.699 --> 00:39:22.409
"In an oat field,
Saturday, May 24.

00:39:22.409 --> 00:39:26.188
I had the best view of the army
in motion there that I ever had

00:39:26.188 --> 00:39:29.784
as they came down a long slope
of low hills to the creek and

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:33.501
then up the other side,
and as we arrived at the top of

00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:37.444
the latter slope I turned and
took a look back and could see

00:39:37.444 --> 00:39:40.670
the long line,
looking like an enormous snake

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.503
winding back for two and three
miles, and bristling with

00:39:44.503 --> 00:39:47.080
bayonets,
and at a short distance the

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.820
Stars and Stripes and the flags
of different states and the

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.451
guidons,
presenting a scene that occurs

00:39:54.451 --> 00:39:59.525
but once in a great while.
It is raining like great guns

00:39:59.525 --> 00:40:04.080
again and the order has come to
pack up and move on."

00:40:08.019 --> 00:40:12.143
"Oh dear Mother,"--this is the
next day--"A large mail has come

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.869
and everybody has got something
but me.

00:40:14.869 --> 00:40:17.830
I cannot write any more under
such circumstances.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.496
So goodbye, my love to all.
[Laughter]

00:40:21.496 --> 00:40:24.486
And if you can,
any of you, spare time,

00:40:24.486 --> 00:40:32.450
please write me a letter.
[Laughter] Love, Charlie."

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.077
Wednesday, May 28^(th).
"Dear Mother,

00:40:35.077 --> 00:40:39.949
Today the sun shines brightly
and it is brazen hot.

00:40:39.949 --> 00:40:43.922
But at half past two this
company has got to go out and

00:40:43.922 --> 00:40:46.570
dig in the trenches for two
hours.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:52.037
One thing is very certain,
if they do not take Richmond

00:40:52.037 --> 00:40:58.112
soon they will kill the whole
army by this ceaseless exposure

00:40:58.112 --> 00:41:00.571
and toil."
May 31^(st),

00:41:00.571 --> 00:41:03.869
the day of the Battle of Seven
Pines.

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:08.342
"Mother, and now in relation to
the coming battle,

00:41:08.342 --> 00:41:12.815
if anything should happen and I
should get killed,

00:41:12.815 --> 00:41:18.325
you will be entitled to my pay.
There is three months due me,

00:41:18.325 --> 00:41:22.636
but if I should not get paid
off before anything should

00:41:22.636 --> 00:41:25.829
happen, my pay will be in two
places;

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:28.457
that is from the
March"--meaning the

00:41:28.457 --> 00:41:32.737
month--"there will be fifty
dollars per month in the State

00:41:32.737 --> 00:41:36.770
Treasury of Massachusetts,
which I have allotted there

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:40.472
subject to my own order.
The rest of my pay is drawn

00:41:40.472 --> 00:41:43.210
from the U.S.
Paymaster, as usual."

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:51.426
Imagine being his mother.
And then it's this letter after

00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:53.655
the battle.
"June 2,1862,

00:41:53.655 --> 00:41:56.930
six miles from Richmond.
Dear Mother,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.293
I presume this letter will find
you most anxious,

00:42:01.293 --> 00:42:05.677
expecting a letter from me.
I'm sitting in the hot sun and

00:42:05.677 --> 00:42:09.830
can write you but a few lines.
Oh Mother, I cannot begin to

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:14.189
give you any idea of the
terrific storm of bullets,

00:42:14.189 --> 00:42:18.025
shot and shell,
that poured over us as we lay

00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:21.364
behind those pits.
We could not get into them for

00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:23.854
they were full of brine of
water, but we lay right behind

00:42:23.854 --> 00:42:26.427
them in the mud.
After half an hour of this the

00:42:26.427 --> 00:42:29.421
firing ceased and we were
ordered forward behind some

00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:32.522
fallen woods."
And then he goes on to describe

00:42:32.522 --> 00:42:36.355
how they were attacked from the
rear and how he heard the

00:42:36.355 --> 00:42:38.820
bullets flying by him
constantly,

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.920
and how he considers it a
miracle that he is alive.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:50.198
And then at the very end of
this letter: "I cannot succeed

00:42:50.198 --> 00:42:53.440
in giving you any idea of
battle.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.716
But I know this much,
that I had no possible hope of

00:42:57.716 --> 00:43:01.687
coming out alive.
And I thought it all over,

00:43:01.687 --> 00:43:05.619
how terribly you would feel,
and all that.

00:43:05.619 --> 00:43:07.809
But I came out without a
scratch.

00:43:07.809 --> 00:43:11.469
I look back upon it and I
cannot think how it can be.

00:43:11.469 --> 00:43:15.781
It does not seem as though any
man that had been there could

00:43:15.781 --> 00:43:19.525
come out unhurt."
Then he begins to describe his

00:43:19.525 --> 00:43:22.978
friends and buddies who were
killed, by name,

00:43:22.978 --> 00:43:26.590
how they were killed,
where they were shot.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.284
And he ends,
"There are so many incidents

00:43:30.284 --> 00:43:35.271
crowding my head Mother,
that I cannot write clearly at

00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:37.497
all.
And even when I sleep,

00:43:37.497 --> 00:43:41.284
the minute I get into a doze,
I hear the whistling of the

00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:43.989
shells and the shouts and the
groans.

00:43:43.989 --> 00:43:50.320
And to sum it up in two words,
it is horrible."

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:01.560
Charlie will survive the war.
He nearly died of dysentery

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.263
twice.
He had two horses shot out from

00:44:04.263 --> 00:44:07.232
under him.
He was deeply proud of his

00:44:07.232 --> 00:44:11.951
commission as a Second
Lieutenant and as an adjutant of

00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:16.989
his regiment.
His regiment was devastated.

00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:23.099
There were so few men left by
July of 1864,

00:44:23.099 --> 00:44:30.760
they were disbanded.
He went home to Massachusetts.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.410
He couldn't imagine being a
civilian.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:37.608
He hated civilians.
He re-enlisted to be a

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:42.901
recruiter of black soldiers.
This racist young man from

00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:46.924
western Massachusetts,
who will freely use the word

00:44:46.924 --> 00:44:49.548
"nigger,"
was employed from August of

00:44:49.548 --> 00:44:53.539
1864 through the end of the war
recruiting black men in Norfolk,

00:44:53.539 --> 00:44:58.610
Virginia, and his principle job
was sitting in an office writing

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.989
love letters for illiterate
black women,

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:08.313
to their husbands at the front,
whom he thanks for teaching him

00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:14.148
the art of love-letter writing.
Well, the battle of the

00:45:14.148 --> 00:45:19.730
peninsula ended up in what's
called the Seven Days.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:25.554
The Battle of the Seven Days
were the battles fought all

00:45:25.554 --> 00:45:30.425
around Richmond,
from June 25^(th) through July

00:45:30.425 --> 00:45:35.019
1^(st),
seven consecutive days;

00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:38.150
places called Mechanicsville,
Gaines Mill,

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.441
Savage Station,
Frazier's Farm,

00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:43.064
Malvern Hill.
They're all little

00:45:43.064 --> 00:45:47.256
crossroads--they're not even
really villages anymore--that

00:45:47.256 --> 00:45:49.390
are just east of Richmond.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:57.050
It was sustained,
day-to-day fighting.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.510
Both sides suffered horrible
casualties.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.321
The result was essentially the
fact that McClellan did not

00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:08.797
succeed in taking Richmond;
in fact, on the contrary,

00:46:08.797 --> 00:46:14.785
McClellan's forces were forced
down south of Richmond to the

00:46:14.785 --> 00:46:20.773
edge of the James River to a
place called Malvern Hill where

00:46:20.773 --> 00:46:27.428
McClellan put his wounded,
damaged army into camp for too

00:46:27.428 --> 00:46:28.130
long.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.344
The Battle of the Seven Days
saved Richmond,

00:46:34.344 --> 00:46:37.459
it saved the Confederacy.
It also brought Robert E.

00:46:37.459 --> 00:46:40.890
Lee into the command of all
Confederate forces in the

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.794
eastern theater of the war,
because Joseph E.

00:46:43.794 --> 00:46:47.159
Johnston, who had been in
command of the Confederate

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:50.722
forces, was wounded on the first
day of the Seven Days,

00:46:50.722 --> 00:46:53.889
and Jefferson Davis put Lee in
command.

00:46:53.889 --> 00:46:59.216
And it was in some ways Lee's
aggressiveness in the Seven Days

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:03.342
that actually won that affair.
And now Lee made the first

00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:05.289
fateful decision of the war,
for him.

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:11.243
After many consultations with
Jefferson Davis and his other

00:47:11.243 --> 00:47:16.889
commanders, he made the decision
to invade the North.

00:47:16.889 --> 00:47:20.077
And this was fateful,
to say the least,

00:47:20.077 --> 00:47:25.025
and it will bring us to the
first major turning point of the

00:47:25.025 --> 00:47:28.401
Civil War.
I've just run the clock out,

00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:30.360
I fear.
Oh damn.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.390
I have two minutes.
Let me leave you here.

00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:48.304
The idea Lee had,
and it's not that complicated,

00:47:48.304 --> 00:47:52.050
is that the war was now
devastating Virginia.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:57.010
Richmond was all but under
siege.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.229
The theory here was take the
war to the North,

00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:04.450
take the war out of Virginia,
take the war to northern soil,

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.344
hopefully get into Maryland.
And he believed there were

00:48:08.344 --> 00:48:11.922
thousands of Maryland men who
would come to the Confederate

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:14.760
standard, if they saw the
Confederate Army.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.760
Threaten the capital,
Washington, DC;

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.739
threaten Philadelphia and
Pennsylvania;

00:48:20.739 --> 00:48:26.137
threaten the North,
take the war to their soil,

00:48:26.137 --> 00:48:30.010
to their farms,
to their homes.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.994
And strategically--and this is
where Jefferson Davis agreed

00:48:32.994 --> 00:48:36.134
with him, although he was very
leery about this--a strike into

00:48:36.134 --> 00:48:39.221
the North that could win a major
victory on northern soil and

00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:43.090
threaten the Union capital,
possibly even enforce an

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:47.973
evacuation of the Federal
capital, might bring the most

00:48:47.973 --> 00:48:53.307
important thing the Confederacy
needed--and they were on the

00:48:53.307 --> 00:48:58.010
verge of it--and that was
British intervention,

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:01.512
British recognition and
intervention on the side of the

00:49:01.512 --> 00:49:04.829
Confederacy.
I'll discuss that possible

00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:10.297
intervention more as a piece of
how emancipation becomes the

00:49:10.297 --> 00:49:14.560
result of this Antietam campaign
next week.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.960
But let me leave you here.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:26.786
Lee decides in the face of a
kind of quiescent McClellan to

00:49:26.786 --> 00:49:32.170
leave only a small force in
Richmond, and move north into

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:37.244
Virginia and invade the north.
McClellan's army,

00:49:37.244 --> 00:49:42.656
having suffered 20,000
casualties in the Seven Days,

00:49:42.656 --> 00:49:47.644
is not going to move,
and he's not going to move

00:49:47.644 --> 00:49:53.516
until he absolutely has to.
It is the first great daring

00:49:53.516 --> 00:49:56.299
move of the war.
It will fail,

00:49:56.299 --> 00:50:00.679
but it nearly succeeded.
And the reason Antietam is the

00:50:00.679 --> 00:50:04.456
first major turning point of
this war is not just because of

00:50:04.456 --> 00:50:08.168
the decisive battle they fought
on the Maryland side of the

00:50:08.168 --> 00:50:10.624
Potomac,
but because it will be the

00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:13.935
occasion to allow Abraham
Lincoln to do what he'd been

00:50:13.935 --> 00:50:16.809
planning to do through much of
that summer,

00:50:16.809 --> 00:50:21.631
and Congress had been prodding
him to do, which was to announce

00:50:21.631 --> 00:50:25.830
to the world that this was a war
to free the slaves.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.096
See you next week.

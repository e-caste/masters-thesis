00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.136
Professor John Merriman:
I don't know if you've been

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.830
following the events in France
in the last couple of days.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.413
By the way, you could,
those of you who know French,

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:12.419
you can get TFN and France 2--I
prefer the latter--on your

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.230
computers, if you want to follow
it.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.699
Just go to google.affaires,
or just go to Google and type

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.634
in France 2, or type in TFN,
and you can get the news from

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:29.642
one o'clock, that is treize
heures, or from vingt

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:32.220
heures,
from eight o'clock at night.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.116
And my other two universities,
Rouen and Lyon II are

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:38.790
completely shut down,
and Rennes,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.042
and Tours, and Toulouse,
because this is a law that

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.229
was--it's going to come into
effect called the Loi

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.041
Pécresse,
after the person who proposed

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:50.201
it.
And what it's going to do is

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.501
it's going to,
among other things,

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:56.405
it's going to make the budgets
of each university kind of

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:59.656
independent,
and it's an attempt to--this is

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:03.390
a logical transition into our
topic today--to Americanize

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.790
French universities so that in a
way the result,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.115
which the students don't like,
is you'll have--you already

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.558
have sort of a gap between the
really good universities like

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:16.843
Paris I or Lyon II,
and the ones that just sort of

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.175
struggle along,
many of the new ones,

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:22.802
like the Pas-de-Calais,
that a friend of mine actually

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:26.299
set up when he was in the
ministry, and the little ones

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.602
like Chambéry and
Besançon and all the

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:32.452
others.
And because of the conditions

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:35.598
that are so difficult in French
universities,

00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:38.099
which are woefully
understaffed,

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.987
and the ones that were built in
the early '60s and early '70s,

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:45.645
like the infamous Villetaneuse,
which is where I've given a

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:48.640
talk once, which was Paris--I
think it's Paris XIV,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.489
and the conditions are just
very, very dreadful.

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.280
So, there's been a lot of
opposition there.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.441
And now that Sarkozy is
President, that the

00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.430
police--these interventions
musclées,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.189
or kind of really brutal
interventions by the CRS

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.340
yesterday, and a couple of
people hurt at Nanterre,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.149
where 1968 began,
and in Rennes I think--no in

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.495
Tours, rather.
So, as a matter of fact when I

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.658
was teaching in Rouen--I do a
course, I've done it the last

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:22.930
couple of Mays,
a course that's a couple of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.987
weeks there, and the first day I
was doing it-- I'd just only met

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:28.949
my students and we went to a
demonstration against Sarkozy,

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.516
in front of the Palace of
Justice, and we were outnumbered

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:35.379
by the CRS.
And they took photos of all us.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.981
And I think that one of the
things that's going to happen in

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:40.450
the future is that this is going
to be a very tense time,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.624
I think.
Now, the big strikes in Paris

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:45.289
now, of course which,
comme d'habitude,

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.669
like all the time,
have taken out the trains

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.823
about, oh, one out of--about
fifteen percent of the trains

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:53.845
are running and the whole line,
if you know Paris,

00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:56.377
the whole metro,
the RER, the whole line B,

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:59.572
line B, which goes from
Saint-Rêmy-les-Chevreuse

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:02.248
all the way to Roissy,
to the airport,

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.882
is completely shut down,
and the buses are running at

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:08.780
about ten percent.
And, so, it's just chaos.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.040
I remember when everybody was
on strike when I was teaching at

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.637
Lyon.
I'd take--the trains weren't on

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:15.270
strike but the buses were and
I'd take the train up to Lyon,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.005
from where we live or from near
where we live,

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.214
and I'd have to walk to Bron,
which is where Lyon II is,

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:24.374
and that's about five miles or
six miles, and I mean it's not a

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:26.417
long run or a long walk.
But people are very

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.322
inconvenienced.
And the other thing that's

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:31.060
going on, and the reason that
the railroads are out,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.193
has nothing to do with the
Pécresse Law,

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:40.853
it has to do with the fact that
Sarkozy's attempt to Americanize

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:45.705
France involves sort of
withdrawing rights that certain

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:50.792
categories of workers received.
And there's a lot of anger now

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:54.139
in Paris, well in other cities
too, against the strikes.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.169
And most people in France do
not approve of the strikes;

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.210
sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.112
I'll give you an example,
people that work on the metro,

00:04:01.112 --> 00:04:03.487
who are underground,
the drivers of the metro,

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:05.439
they're underground all the
time.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.117
Imagine working eight hours a
day and you're underground the

00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:11.312
whole time--they have the right,
in principle--is it fifty,

00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:14.998
does anyone remember if it's
fifty--do you remember if it's

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:19.130
fifty or fifty-five for les
chauffeurs de métro?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.084
Fifty-five.
But there's some of the TGV

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:25.720
drivers--and that's a big,
high stress occupation;

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.777
it's not like driving a plane
but--you don't drive a plane,

00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:30.886
I don't know,
you pilot a plane--but they

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:32.889
have the right to retire at
fifty.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.258
Now, that seems awfully young,
and Sarkozy in his campaign

00:04:36.258 --> 00:04:40.100
against the ill-fated campaign
of Ségolène Royal,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.920
said that he "wanted to make
the French work again."

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.844
He also said a lot of other
provocative things,

00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:46.996
and for a son of immigrants,
a fils des

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:50.377
immigrés,
who seems to hate immigrants,

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:53.190
very provocative things.
But, anyway,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.387
he's going to carry these
policies until the very end,

00:04:57.387 --> 00:05:01.029
and so this is going to happen
quite a lot.

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.189
I've got a sountenance de
thèse,

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.733
a thesis defense at Lyon,
a jury I have to participate

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:06.862
in,
in December,

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:10.425
and I'm kind of wondering
whether this is going to take

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:13.108
place.
But you can follow this through

00:05:13.108 --> 00:05:16.139
the newspapers and through--the
other thing,

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.016
if you read French and
want--well, you can follow it

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:20.040
through the New York
Times online or anything,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.662
but you can also get
libération.affaires,

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:25.954
so you can read Libé
every day or you can read

00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:29.500
Le Monde or whatever,
if you want to keep up on this.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.595
I'm going to be,
this afternoon,

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:35.245
calling my student pals in
Rouen and finding out what's

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:37.300
going on with them.
One of them,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.761
who's always in every
demonstration,

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:40.806
he's always there,
and so last time he went out to

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:43.060
a demonstration and all these
police--and they know him

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.980
because he's in all the
demonstrations,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.862
and this one policeman said to
him, he's got this huge stick

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:50.645
and he says to the student,
this little teeny guy,

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:54.183
and he has this stick and he
says, "I'm reserving this for

00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:56.210
you Sven,"
and all of this.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.461
And they have a memory too.
But, anyway,

00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.310
so ça bouge en France
maintenant.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.155
Well, I want to talk--that is,
I think, a logical thing to

00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:09.337
talk about, because I'm going to
talk about anti-Americanism in

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:11.613
France.
And it's hard to do,

00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:16.136
to talk about anti-Americanism
from 1945 until now in a mere

00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:19.415
fifty minutes.
And let me say at the outset

00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:23.789
that having spent half my life
or half the last thirty years of

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.399
my life in France--more than
that,

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.999
actually--I've never once
encountered anti-Americanism,

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.550
which ça n'a rien
à voir avec,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.286
it doesn't matter.
But what I am saying is that

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:37.616
the anti-Americanism in France
has always been against the

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:40.980
United States policies and,
particularly in the earlier

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.259
days, the United States' sort of
cultural imperialism,

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.704
but has had nothing to do with
anti-Americanism against

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:53.173
American people.
I've been introduced in a book,

00:06:53.173 --> 00:06:56.106
in which I contributed some
sort of random musings about

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:59.957
living in Ardèche,
as a political refugee in

00:06:59.957 --> 00:07:05.050
France, at various times,
and people joke about that.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.645
So, I'm differentiating
anti-Americanism,

00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:13.589
like people they don't like
Americans, with anti-U.S.

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.256
policies and an anti-,
what was considered by many

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:18.269
people, particularly
intellectuals,

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:24.858
sort of a cultural arrogance,
that risked making France less

00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:29.892
than what it had always been.
And, so, let me talk a little

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:32.208
bit about that.
And here I'm drawing heavily at

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:35.151
the first part of the lecture on
my friend Dick Kuisel's book on

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:37.019
anti-Americanism in the early
stages;

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:42.209
but it's an interesting story
and it's one that's worth

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:46.183
telling.
Now, when I teach in Rouen I go

00:07:46.183 --> 00:07:50.947
often to this café
that's near the railroad

00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:53.915
station there,
and it's a café

00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.324
where Sartre and Simone de
Beauvoir, who are well-known to

00:07:57.324 --> 00:07:59.767
almost everybody,
used to go all the time,

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.884
and it's kind of fun to be in a
café where you imagine

00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:07.004
that they were.
And they were a good example of

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:12.447
kind of the intellectual
anti-Americanism that emerged

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:16.998
after World War Two.
Now, why did this kind of

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:21.899
philosophical and intellectual
anti-Americanism emerge?

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:25.793
You have to put it in the
context of the ideological

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:29.610
controversies that emerged out
of World War One;

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.950
and by that I mean from 1945
well into the mid-1950s.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.290
There were dock strikes against
the arrival of U.S.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.739
military equipment.
Remember, the Americans had

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:49.259
huge, huge bases in France until
the time of de Gaulle.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:52.835
If you go to the town of
Châteauroux--which isn't a

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:56.730
very interesting town and the
only great restaurant in it left

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.625
and moved to Tours--you'd go by
these just abandoned airfields

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:04.009
that used to just be full of
American military,

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:08.299
air force equipment,
and officers.

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:11.850
And, so, you see a lot of these
signs.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.850
There were angry outbursts even
against the Marshall Plan.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.511
The Marshall Plan,
as you know from other courses,

00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:24.070
brought American aid in great
quantities to Western Europe,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.945
and one of the reasons was to
keep Western Europe out of

00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:32.542
Soviet influence.
And this drew predictable

00:09:32.542 --> 00:09:36.521
attacks from the Parti
Communiste, from the Communist

00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:40.726
Party,
because of the obvious

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:47.759
ideological division that was
the Cold War.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:51.787
So, and it also was the time
when the Rosenbergs,

00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:55.394
in this country,
were executed for allegedly

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:59.169
passing nuclear secrets to
Soviet agents;

00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:02.679
and these kinds of executions,
as had been the execution of

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:06.044
Sacco and Vanzetti,
who were anarchists who were

00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:09.186
executed in 1927,
these have, with the mass

00:10:09.186 --> 00:10:12.655
press,
although way before Internet,

00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:17.535
great ramifications.
But the French economy grows so

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:22.970
rapidly over the next thirty
years, thirty glorious years,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.150
and part of the rise of
consumerism and the consumer

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.397
culture--in France it was backed
by the arrival of such novelties

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:37.480
as refrigerators and things like
that--was very much identified

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.636
with U.S.
culture and was debated,

00:10:41.636 --> 00:10:47.490
particularly by intellectuals,
rather heatedly.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.809
There were pro-American
intellectuals who made the case

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:57.009
in the very beginning that the
American path was the way to go.

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.802
The most famous was probably
Raymond Aron,

00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:03.208
a-r-o-n, but there were others
like François

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:07.840
Mauriac--and I can't remember if
Chip in his book mentions--yes,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.728
I'm sure he does.
But the Communist intellectuals

00:11:10.728 --> 00:11:13.477
were adamantly against all
things that were American,

00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:16.120
and of course they were very
much over the top.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.681
Dick Kuisel quotes the famous
Communist poet,

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:24.309
Louis Aragon,
describing the U.S.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.679
as, quote, "a civilization of
bathtubs and

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:32.118
frigidaires," in 1951,
as if this was a very bad

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:34.517
thing;
and he did not mean it,

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:36.779
as Kuisel says,
as a compliment.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.647
It was the Parti Communiste,
the Communist Party,

00:11:39.647 --> 00:11:42.993
that coined phrases like the
"Coca-Colanization of

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:46.054
France."
And the arrival of Coca Cola in

00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:50.517
France of course was a terribly
important moment--more about

00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:53.900
that in a minute.
At the time of the NATO pact,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.350
the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.043
in 1949,
these kinds of debates hit a

00:12:00.043 --> 00:12:04.305
boiling point,
and in an age of graffiti,

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:09.333
the graffiti,
"Yankee Go Home," was a bit

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:12.899
everywhere.
Now, the U.S.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.675
nuclear capacity,
which was of course very soon

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:23.695
matched by the Soviet nuclear
capacity, seemed to raise the

00:12:23.695 --> 00:12:29.184
cry against the Americans.
There was a SACM conference in

00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:33.382
1950 against nuclear power.
And France is a country that

00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:37.701
almost leads the world in the
percentage of its energy that is

00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:42.212
drawn from these nuclear plants,
of which several are not all

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:45.260
that far from us,
and there's a big sort of

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.687
anti-nuclear reaction now that's
mostly through ecologists and

00:12:49.687 --> 00:12:53.486
the Greens and folks like that.
But in the beginning,

00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:56.764
because the Americans are the
ones who had used the nuclear

00:12:56.764 --> 00:12:59.759
bomb--other people have never
used a nuclear bomb,

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:02.460
never sensed it,
have used the nuclear bomb.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.649
We live in a world in which
Israel has a nuclear bomb,

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:06.259
in which Pakistan has a nuclear
bomb,

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:11.314
in which India has a nuclear
bomb, as well as France and

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:15.480
Britain, and China as well,
I do believe.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.950
So, therefore all of this is
still very scary.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.221
But in the origins this
anti-Americanism was increased

00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:29.057
by the fear that the Americans
and their Cold War against the

00:13:29.057 --> 00:13:33.893
Soviet Union would turn--that
the damage would not be done in

00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:38.889
Mississippi or in Minnesota but
would be done in Europe.

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:44.512
And, so, intellectuals also
accused the Americans of

00:13:44.512 --> 00:13:49.921
ignoring European culture.
Remember the infamous Donald

00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:55.146
Rumsfeld referred scathingly to
"old Europe," at a time when the

00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:59.556
Americans were invading Iraq,
as if old Europe with its

00:13:59.556 --> 00:14:01.804
quaint streets,
and old churches,

00:14:01.804 --> 00:14:05.879
and long cultures were
something not worth remembering.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:12.852
But, again, the critics of
American culture were over the

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.779
top.
L'Humanité,

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:19.268
the Communist newspaper,
and still today,

00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:24.500
said that one could starve even
if one owned a telephone;

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.283
and the telephone,
where you can't even find a

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.820
fixed phone anymore--I can't
telephone,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.563
I can't even call on a phone
when I go back to University of

00:14:32.563 --> 00:14:35.120
Michigan because there is
literally only one fixed phone

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.259
left on the campus,
and I don't have a cell phone

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:39.250
because I don't like cell
phones, I can't stand them.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.243
I agree with those people who
said that they had great faith

00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:44.019
in humanity until the cell
phone;

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:46.259
and plus my daughter's lost
three of them already.

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:49.652
But the French Minister of
Communications,

00:14:49.652 --> 00:14:54.370
in 1964--this is the French
Minister of Communications,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.228
in 1964, avant vous,
before you existed,

00:14:58.228 --> 00:15:03.430
but not before I existed--he
called the telephone a gimmick,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:08.363
in 1964.
But it wasn't the telephone

00:15:08.363 --> 00:15:12.169
that drew heat it was above
all--well the refrigerators,

00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:15.393
you couldn't tell the average
housewife living wherever,

00:15:15.393 --> 00:15:18.508
in the Morbihan or someplace,
in Brittany or wherever,

00:15:18.508 --> 00:15:20.779
that the refrigerator wasn't a
good deal.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:24.610
But, yet, for the Communist
Party a frigo,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.643
a refrigerator,
a Frigidaire which is a

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:32.352
model--I don't know if it still
is--was only good for making

00:15:32.352 --> 00:15:37.060
ice-cubes for fancy aperitifs
where you would drink American

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.529
or Scottish--American bourbon or
Scotch whiskey.

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:45.224
So, they--Aragon,
this again is the Communist

00:15:45.224 --> 00:15:50.455
poet--wrote, "a Ford automobile,
the civilization of Detroit,

00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:53.509
the assembly line,
the atomic danger,

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:57.309
encircled by napalm"--now,
he said this early on.

00:15:57.309 --> 00:16:00.457
Remember, it's the Americans
who used napalm in Vietnam,

00:16:00.457 --> 00:16:03.090
it was the Americans used
napalm in Vietnam.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.267
"Here is the symbol of the
subjugation to the dollar,

00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:09.139
applauded even in the land of
Molière,

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:13.113
the Yankee more arrogant than
the Nazi holocaust"--this is

00:16:13.113 --> 00:16:16.460
absurd--"substitutes the machine
for the poet,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.410
Coca Cola for poetry,
the Ford for Victor Hugo."

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.329
It degenerated to that extent.
A great sociologist called

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:28.238
Edgar Morin, who has a brilliant
book on a--it's called The

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:31.341
Red and the White,
about a Breton village--he

00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:35.309
called Readers Digest "a
pocketsize stupifier,

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:39.591
a drug for little minds," and
he attacked, was one of the

00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:43.261
earliest to attack
Franglais--and more about that

00:16:43.261 --> 00:16:47.346
in awhile--that is,
the absorption of American

00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:52.535
terms into the French language;
toothpaste, for example,

00:16:52.535 --> 00:16:58.350
instead of dentifrice,
flooding the French language.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.345
But, again, you have to put
this in the context of the

00:17:01.345 --> 00:17:04.680
times, and that's what I guess
what historians try to do.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.094
Sixty percent of the people in
the Communist Party thought the

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:10.338
U.S.
was readying an aggressive war,

00:17:10.338 --> 00:17:14.154
and almost ninety-five percent
of people in the Communist Party

00:17:14.154 --> 00:17:16.370
were against the presence of
U.S.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.651
bases in France.
Now, remember,

00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:22.345
the guy who got rid of the U.S.
bases in France was Charles de

00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:25.600
Gaulle, who was anything but a
communist, who was completely

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.914
opposite of a communist,
but his view,

00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:30.704
as we'll see,
was that France had to maintain

00:17:30.704 --> 00:17:35.130
its status as a great power,
had to have a neutral path and

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.819
influence in places where French
was spoken,

00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:45.123
particularly in West and North
Africa, and in the Middle East

00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:49.329
in parts, in Lebanon,
and things like that.

00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:52.982
So, there were some
intellectuals who tried to find

00:17:52.982 --> 00:17:57.730
a third way, who weren't kind of
parroting the Communist Party,

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:04.599
or were going to kowtow the way
Sarkozy is to America.

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:07.001
And Le Monde,
for example,

00:18:07.001 --> 00:18:11.204
which is without question the
most reputable newspaper in

00:18:11.204 --> 00:18:13.207
France,
though Libé is

00:18:13.207 --> 00:18:14.846
quite good too,
et c'est plutôt

00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:17.918
à mon goût,
but it took a more neutral

00:18:17.918 --> 00:18:21.592
position in all of this,
because there were many people

00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:25.810
in France who weren't Communists
that thought that the Marshall

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.599
Plan was a way of buying off
Europe.

00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:31.563
And I wasn't--I was vaguely
around in those days,

00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:34.402
but the fear was,
after World War One there was

00:18:34.402 --> 00:18:37.859
the thought that nobody would
ever want another war;

00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:41.990
after World War Two,
and after the atomic bomb,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.390
and after the horrors of all
that had happened,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.494
and the Holocaust,
people were quite certain that

00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:53.030
there would be another war.
So, it was a time of great

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.329
fear, and so these were big
issues.

00:18:55.329 --> 00:18:58.558
In 1952, at the time of the
visit of U.S.

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:02.996
General Matthew Ridgeway to
take control of NATO forces,

00:19:02.996 --> 00:19:07.920
there were huge demonstrations
against the United States.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.468
He was called a butcher in the
Korean War, which certainly

00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:13.907
wasn't true;
he was called a war criminal

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:17.347
and that wasn't true either.
But this came at a time when it

00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:20.747
was the government of a guy,
who just died only a couple of

00:19:20.747 --> 00:19:22.384
years ago,
lived to be about

00:19:22.384 --> 00:19:24.186
130-years-old,
called Antoine Pinay,

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:26.808
who was from Saint-Chamond,
near Saint-Étienne,

00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:28.882
if I remember correctly,
and he had been accused of

00:19:28.882 --> 00:19:33.420
collaboration during the war,
and he was in power.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.921
And he tried to ludicrously
enough break the influence of

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:41.169
the Parti Communiste.
And one of their leaders--I

00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:44.331
didn't know about this incident
till I read Kuisel--one of the

00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:46.559
incidents was he accused Jacques
Duclos,

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:49.328
a name you can forget,
but he was an interesting guy

00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:51.500
who was leader of the Communist
Party,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.151
of being a spy for the Soviets,
and his proof was that they'd

00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:02.049
found two dead pigeons in the
backseat of his car,

00:20:02.049 --> 00:20:05.515
and an autopsy on the birds,
that he thought they were

00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:08.000
carrier pigeons that were
smuggling,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.817
going to send secrets off to
some Soviet spies,

00:20:11.817 --> 00:20:15.593
somewhere out of the country.
And of course they did an

00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:18.627
autopsy on these birds and they
discovered--I don't know how you

00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:21.107
do this, do an autopsy;
I didn't want to be in the

00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:23.563
room--but they were not carrier
pigeons but they were

00:20:23.563 --> 00:20:25.500
pigeons--people in France eat
pigeons,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.477
pigeonneau,
and that they simply--he had

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.143
them in his backseat because he
was going to take home and cook

00:20:30.143 --> 00:20:32.291
them,
hopefully with lots of garlic,

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:34.963
and to eat them.
And Jean-Paul Sartre,

00:20:34.963 --> 00:20:39.584
he said it at the same time,
that if he had to choose sides

00:20:39.584 --> 00:20:43.170
in the Cold War,
he would choose the USSR.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:49.329
Now Sartre, like lots of fellow
travelers, were delusional about

00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:53.730
what had happened in Stalin's
Soviet Union,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.660
and his partner,
Simone de Beauvoir,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.930
who's terribly important in the
rise of feminism,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.369
as I'm sure you know,
she came to the U.S.

00:21:05.369 --> 00:21:08.865
in 1947--she had been in
1947--and she liked the sort of

00:21:08.865 --> 00:21:11.089
dynamism of the American
economy,

00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:14.841
and she liked its freedom,
but she was immediately

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:18.210
suspicious of racism in the
United States,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.607
in the 1940s and the 1950s,
as indeed in our own time,

00:21:22.607 --> 00:21:27.339
sadly, though not as much,
was a time of racism;

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:30.001
and she said so,
she came right out and said,

00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:33.390
and that became a part of the
anti-American discourse.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.809
Because when the Americans
would get holier than thou about

00:21:36.809 --> 00:21:39.640
how people in Europe treated
their minorities,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.587
all you had to look to the
United States,

00:21:42.587 --> 00:21:46.714
where I can think back to my
own childhood when the three

00:21:46.714 --> 00:21:51.210
freedom workers were so brutally
murdered in Mississippi;

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:58.051
and they would point to that.
Now, what about the role of

00:21:58.051 --> 00:22:01.315
Coca-Cola in all of this?
I imagine you may have seen

00:22:01.315 --> 00:22:02.829
Coca-Cola a few times in your
lives.

00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:08.117
It became--it still is so
identified with America,

00:22:08.117 --> 00:22:13.190
and it probably is,
I think it's fair to say,

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:19.893
the single item that is most
identified in the rest of the

00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:25.971
world with the United States;
that you couldn't talk to

00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:31.319
people in France or anywhere
else about baseball and you

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:35.210
could not talk to them about
hotdogs,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.954
although this strange thing
emerged in the 1960s called

00:22:38.954 --> 00:22:41.589
le hotdog,
which are two sort of

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:44.744
miserably,
almost frozen frankfurters with

00:22:44.744 --> 00:22:49.042
some sort of god-awful cheese
put on them, and put in what was

00:22:49.042 --> 00:22:51.720
then the equivalent of a
microwave;

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.899
but it was Coca Cola.
And as you know the product was

00:22:56.899 --> 00:23:00.059
created I think in the late
1880s.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.314
It's very hard to get into the
archive, though Kuisel managed

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.079
to do it, to get into the
Coca-Cola archives;

00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:05.660
afraid you might find that
recipe.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.661
And of course I think somebody
told me that cocaine was put

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:15.059
originally into Coke,
at the beginning of it all.

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:21.074
Let me give you some examples
how Coke and American view of

00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:25.430
itself and view of the world
came to be.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:29.228
"We will see that every man in
uniform gets a bottle of

00:23:29.228 --> 00:23:33.026
Coca-Cola for five cents
wherever he is and whatever it

00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:36.221
costs,"
was what Coca-Cola had to say

00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:41.147
about the relationship between
soldiers if they survived the

00:23:41.147 --> 00:23:47.670
Bataan death march and whatever,
and that was it.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:52.132
Coca-Cola actually sent people
as "technical observers," a

00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:56.051
phrase they used,
to see where bottling plants

00:23:56.051 --> 00:24:00.740
could, after the fighting ended,
be set up in Europe.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.485
One U.S.
soldier wrote a letter in which

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:06.620
he said, "to my mind I am in
this damn mess as much to help

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.808
to keep the custom of drinking
Cokes as I am to preserve the

00:24:09.808 --> 00:24:12.727
million other benefits our
country blesses its citizens

00:24:12.727 --> 00:24:16.316
with."
Sixty-four bottling plants were

00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:21.623
set up in Europe after the war,
immediately after the war,

00:24:21.623 --> 00:24:26.938
within a couple of years.
They expand to Belgium and

00:24:26.938 --> 00:24:33.396
Luxembourg and the Netherlands
in 1947, also to Switzerland and

00:24:33.396 --> 00:24:37.250
Italy, and then to France in
1949.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.823
The Olympics of 1950 were held
in Finland, in Helsinki,

00:24:40.823 --> 00:24:44.396
and there was not yet--had not
yet been time to build a

00:24:44.396 --> 00:24:47.566
Coca-Cola plant.
So, what they did is they got a

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:50.605
hold of some D-Day landing
vessels, filled them with

00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:53.582
Coca-Cola,
and the Coca-Cola Company

00:24:53.582 --> 00:24:58.604
landed on the shores of Finland,
literally, with all these

00:24:58.604 --> 00:25:03.890
publicity material and with
720,000 bottles of Coca Cola.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.861
Now, the chairman of--I didn't
know this either until I read

00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:11.430
Kuisel--the chairman of
Coca-Cola was James Farley,

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.933
who was a former aide to
Franklin Roosevelt and thus he

00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:18.828
was very--had good contacts,
and he was a militant

00:25:18.828 --> 00:25:24.303
anti-Communist who identified
the drinking of Coca-Cola with

00:25:24.303 --> 00:25:27.836
democracy.
The Soviets and in their

00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:33.847
satellite states did not drink
Coca-Cola but good old Americans

00:25:33.847 --> 00:25:37.200
drank Coca-Cola.
Now, you're going to run into

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.398
huge lobbies in these countries.
In Belgium you're going to run

00:25:40.398 --> 00:25:42.420
into the beer lobby,
terribly important.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.679
In the Pays-Bas,
in the Netherlands,

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.190
you're going to run into the
beer lobby,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.283
and in France you will run head
on into that lobby you already

00:25:48.283 --> 00:25:50.732
know something about,
the wine lobby,

00:25:50.732 --> 00:25:55.691
which in a way is neither Left
nor Right, but--it's neither

00:25:55.691 --> 00:25:59.044
Left nor Right,
it's a little more complicated

00:25:59.044 --> 00:26:02.498
than that.
And they tried to stir up

00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:06.289
popular action against
Coca-Cola.

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:10.523
A Communist paper in Italy said
that drinking Coke would make

00:26:10.523 --> 00:26:15.109
children's hair turn white and
therefore you shouldn't do that.

00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:16.996
In Austria The
Communist,

00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:20.770
the biggest communist newspaper
in Vienna, wrote that Coca-Cola

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.653
plants,
by virtue of the machines they

00:26:23.653 --> 00:26:27.489
used, could be easily
transformed into plants capable

00:26:27.489 --> 00:26:33.287
of turning out nuclear bombs,
and so that good Viennese and

00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:40.400
good Austrians should avoid the
"insidious, numbing drink."

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.450
Cokes had begun to arrive in
France after World War One but

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:51.109
only in very small numbers and
in extremely fancy cafés.

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:56.661
And, so, the Coca-Cola--Kuisel
got into the archives to find

00:26:56.661 --> 00:27:02.306
all this--Coca-Cola marketers
divided France into six regions

00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:07.387
and figured they should
anticipate each person drinking

00:27:07.387 --> 00:27:12.672
six Coca-Colas per year.
The problem is that foreign

00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:18.144
investments, such as building
plants, required the permission

00:27:18.144 --> 00:27:25.913
of the Ministry of Finance;
and that all this anxiety comes

00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:29.353
along.
The Ministry of Finance gets

00:27:29.353 --> 00:27:33.878
involved in all of this
business, the debate reaches the

00:27:33.878 --> 00:27:36.839
Chamber of Deputies in the
1950s;

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:40.163
and also this merges with other
fears of other American

00:27:40.163 --> 00:27:42.332
products.
John Deere--some of you may be

00:27:42.332 --> 00:27:44.521
from Illinois,
isn't that where John Deere is

00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:47.016
made,
the tractors and all that--and

00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:51.000
that is by far the biggest
successful company in marketing

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.634
machinery that's been part of
the French agricultural

00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:58.499
revolution since World War Two;
but of course the little

00:27:58.499 --> 00:28:01.480
producers in France were against
John Deere as well.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.638
It also comes at a time,
as you know,

00:28:04.638 --> 00:28:09.201
of widespread outrage of
intellectuals and filmmakers

00:28:09.201 --> 00:28:14.289
against the Hollywoodization of
French movie theaters,

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:16.913
and because France,
its idea and attitudes towards

00:28:16.913 --> 00:28:20.179
their own movies has always been
that as its attitudes towards

00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:22.160
almost all industrial
production,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.125
that France makes these fine
little products of quality,

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:29.503
and the arrival of,
God-forbid, the Charlton

00:28:29.503 --> 00:28:34.240
Heston's of the world and John
Wayne and all this stuff--so,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.311
these debates are going on
among intellectuals and film

00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:42.190
watchers, et cetera.
These debates just go on and on.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.327
Radio stations in France now
have to play a certain

00:28:46.327 --> 00:28:50.133
percentage of French music,
as opposed to Bruce

00:28:50.133 --> 00:28:53.940
Springsteen, and the Stones,
and whatever;

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.529
they have to have a certain
percentage.

00:28:55.529 --> 00:29:00.708
And, so, there is still this
paranoia that English or French

00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:06.063
music or other kinds of music
coming will wipe out what's left

00:29:06.063 --> 00:29:11.069
of the French music industry,
and that people won't play

00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:14.395
Jacques Brel anymore,
or Georges Brassens,

00:29:14.395 --> 00:29:18.725
or Léo Ferré,
or Johnny Hallyday,

00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:24.810
who anyway who was born Belgian
and he has his own problems,

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:29.536
so it has nothing to do with it.
But, yet, when there are these

00:29:29.536 --> 00:29:35.600
debates it seemed like the ties
between Coke and the U.S.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.730
Government were even stronger.
Coca-Cola demanded that the

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.844
U.S.
State Department intervene in

00:29:40.844 --> 00:29:44.688
some way to stop this kind of
uprising against the arrival of

00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:49.200
Coca-Cola.
U.S. papers went wild.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.324
"Coca-Cola was not injurious to
the health of American soldiers

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:54.289
that liberated France from the
Nazis,

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:59.097
so that Communist deputies
could sit in session today," was

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:01.750
one editorial in a U.S.
paper.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.233
You can't spread the doctrines
of Marx among people who drink

00:30:05.233 --> 00:30:07.348
Coca-Cola.
The dark principles of

00:30:07.348 --> 00:30:10.637
revolution and a rising
proletariat may be expounded

00:30:10.637 --> 00:30:13.539
over a bottle of vodka on a
scarred table,

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:16.342
such as in Morry's or some
place like that,

00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:20.080
or even a bottle of brandy,
but it's utterly fantastic to

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.884
imagine two men stepping to a
soda fountain and ordering a

00:30:23.884 --> 00:30:27.487
couple of Cokes in which to
toast the downfall of their

00:30:27.487 --> 00:30:33.019
capitalist oppressors.
And so it went.

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:37.371
But Coca-Cola arrived in
France, it got permission to be

00:30:37.371 --> 00:30:41.089
produced in France and to be
drunk in France,

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.069
and still is,
though often by American

00:30:44.069 --> 00:30:47.157
tourists in France.
I have been on several

00:30:47.157 --> 00:30:50.714
occasions in really good,
and in one case even great--and

00:30:50.714 --> 00:30:55.261
this is not dissing Americans,
forgive me--great restaurants

00:30:55.261 --> 00:31:00.079
and seeing Americans ordering
Coca-Cola with their four or

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:04.890
five-course meal.
And that does make me sad.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.500
Does it make me sound like a
snob?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.200
I've seen people drink milk,
too, and things like that.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.463
Anyway, what can I say?
I shouldn't get so involved in

00:31:15.463 --> 00:31:17.630
all this stuff.
How did people like Coca-Cola?

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.163
A poll, a sondage--the
French take to American polls,

00:31:21.163 --> 00:31:24.628
do these polls all the time;
sondage is the word for

00:31:24.628 --> 00:31:28.021
a poll--in 1953 said that only
seventeen percent of people who

00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:30.425
drank it liked it,
and sixty percent not at all,

00:31:30.425 --> 00:31:32.895
and the other ones couldn't
remember because they'd gone on

00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:35.819
to something else,
drinking something else I guess.

00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:42.091
But the dykes began to break
and millions of Cokes are sold

00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:46.200
every year in France,
as everywhere.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.269
Now, this is just an aside but
this is the same case as in

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:53.399
Africa;
the debates have not been the

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:56.196
same but one of the interesting
things, and I think sad things

00:31:56.196 --> 00:31:58.809
about the places I know in
Africa--which are very few,

00:31:58.809 --> 00:32:03.817
but I have family members who
know Africa pretty well--is that

00:32:03.817 --> 00:32:07.923
the domination of Coke,
particularly in places that are

00:32:07.923 --> 00:32:11.700
Muslim, in which people don't
drink alcoholic beverages,

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.811
the domination of Coke,
and Fanta, which are very,

00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:17.605
very expensive,
for people who have almost no

00:32:17.605 --> 00:32:20.486
money,
and the Fanta sort of becomes

00:32:20.486 --> 00:32:24.980
the equivalent of a celebration
with champagne in France,

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.131
or the United States,
or some places where people

00:32:27.131 --> 00:32:29.111
drink.
And, so, some of the same

00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:33.131
issues, some of the same debates
are there, and these companies

00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:35.660
just make zillions off these
drinks.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.190
And I'm not criticizing these
companies, am I?

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.374
I guess I don't know.
But, anyway,

00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:44.074
now let's talk about some of
the other aspects of

00:32:44.074 --> 00:32:48.853
anti-Americanism before I end in
fifteen minutes or so with the

00:32:48.853 --> 00:32:50.780
obvious ones,
today.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:57.284
Well, architecture, for example.
Many of the debates about

00:32:57.284 --> 00:33:00.234
preservation,
about keeping Paris,

00:33:00.234 --> 00:33:03.720
Poitiers, anywhere you want to
name,

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.278
the beautiful center of
Strasbourg, the way they have

00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:12.311
always been, have involved
fighting against the

00:33:12.311 --> 00:33:14.961
skyscraperization,
if you will,

00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:17.846
the gratte-ciels,
les gratte-ciels,

00:33:17.846 --> 00:33:22.174
the skyscrapers in France.
In the late 1960s there was a

00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:25.740
huge debate over the Tour
Montparnasse.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.824
And the Tour Montparnasse is
right on the--it's where the

00:33:29.824 --> 00:33:33.982
Station of Montparnasse is in
Paris, it's right beyond the

00:33:33.982 --> 00:33:39.246
Boulevard Montparnasse there;
was built with the enthusiastic

00:33:39.246 --> 00:33:44.960
cooperation, if not money in the
pockets, of George Pompidou,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.272
the President of France,
who said, "we must renounce

00:33:48.272 --> 00:33:51.519
this outmoded aesthetic"--that's
an exact quote.

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:54.226
And, so, the big battle over
the Tour Montparnasse which

00:33:54.226 --> 00:33:59.740
is--here I give my own view but,
mon vue--it is a hideous

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:06.059
building that is a blight on the
skyline of Paris.

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:09.198
And it's said the only thing
good about it is you can't see

00:34:09.198 --> 00:34:11.579
it when you're viewing Paris
from the top;

00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:13.280
and they have the elevator that
shoots up to the top;

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.273
and it destroyed--well,
anyway, what can one say,

00:34:16.273 --> 00:34:19.498
it's an obvious thing.
Now, people that defended the

00:34:19.498 --> 00:34:22.002
Tour Montparnasse,
which is identified with

00:34:22.002 --> 00:34:25.081
Chicago and the skyscrapers,
would say, "well,

00:34:25.081 --> 00:34:28.413
look, well people criticized
the Tour d'Eiffel,

00:34:28.413 --> 00:34:32.469
the Eiffel Tower when it was
built in 1888 and 1889";

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.667
and Zola was among those who
signed saying this is awful,

00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:38.527
it must go.
And it is part of what people

00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:41.550
go to see.
Now, people do not go to see

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:46.071
the Tour Montparnasse because
the Eiffel Tower represented

00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:50.909
changes in industry and steel
and iron and all this stuff,

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:55.152
and the Tour Montparnasse just
represents kind of an American

00:34:55.152 --> 00:34:58.971
approach to architecture that
the traditionalists found

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.840
wanting.
And, so, what they did

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.880
subsequently is they built La
Défense,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.710
which is outside of Paris but
you can see it if you stand,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.492
for example,
in the Tuileries,

00:35:08.492 --> 00:35:11.879
or around there;
you can see it beyond the Arc

00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:14.739
d'Triomphe--and that's where
lots of business is,

00:35:14.739 --> 00:35:17.277
that's the kind of
Americanization of French

00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:20.678
architecture and business.
But generally the French have

00:35:20.678 --> 00:35:24.175
been very good of trying to
protect Paris from the planners

00:35:24.175 --> 00:35:27.852
who would destroy the way the
place looks with an Americanized

00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:31.320
kind of architecture.
There've been other problems

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.682
too.
The constructions at Place

00:35:33.682 --> 00:35:37.493
d'Italie and the Tour
Montparnasse became only the

00:35:37.493 --> 00:35:40.496
most famous.
And appropriately enough,

00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:44.609
these kinds of battles to
protect Paris against this kind

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:47.767
of architecture have involved
the far Right,

00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:50.732
conservative Right;
not the faisceaux,

00:35:50.732 --> 00:35:52.464
the fascist Right,
but the far Right,

00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:54.340
like my late friend Louis
Chevalier,

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.387
a very conservative man,
who was the greatest historian

00:35:57.387 --> 00:36:00.264
in Paris, or my friend
François Laurier who's

00:36:00.264 --> 00:36:03.594
now head of the committee to
preserve old Paris--with people

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:06.249
on the Left,
like sort of the French

00:36:06.249 --> 00:36:08.814
equivalent to me,
against the Center,

00:36:08.814 --> 00:36:12.449
against the kind of
planners who just want to

00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:15.366
make money.
But other aspects of

00:36:15.366 --> 00:36:19.896
Americanization--the word
pavilion in France--people

00:36:19.896 --> 00:36:25.670
wanted to have their houses in
the prosperous suburbs at best,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.090
at Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuse,
for example,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.874
most--or the suburbs,
in the time we're talking

00:36:30.874 --> 00:36:33.041
about,
until 1945, are miserable

00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:36.413
places, but that people in
Saint-Germain en Laye in the

00:36:36.413 --> 00:36:39.015
west of Paris or Versailles,
you know what,

00:36:39.015 --> 00:36:41.726
they wanted to have their
pavilion which was a big kind of

00:36:41.726 --> 00:36:44.769
modern Americanized house with
all these things--cell phones,

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.972
refrigerators,
all this business,

00:36:46.972 --> 00:36:50.353
swimming pools and lawns.
What could be more American

00:36:50.353 --> 00:36:52.457
than lawns?
Now, the vast majority of the

00:36:52.457 --> 00:36:55.510
people who live in the Parisian
region do not live in houses,

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.071
they live in apartments,
and the vast majority live in

00:36:58.071 --> 00:36:59.860
buildings that they do not
own--or,

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.370
not the vast majority but the
majority do.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.917
But that became a big issue.
The television,

00:37:05.917 --> 00:37:10.075
the television--people thought
that television would destroy

00:37:10.075 --> 00:37:12.477
France.
I used to say that when Charles

00:37:12.477 --> 00:37:13.736
de Gaulle died,
finally,

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:16.638
Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises,
he died of boredom watching

00:37:16.638 --> 00:37:18.346
French TV;
because French TV,

00:37:18.346 --> 00:37:21.102
which has some of the best
stuff around but also has some

00:37:21.102 --> 00:37:23.557
of the worst,
just talk shows that go on,

00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:25.719
and on, and on,
it's just numbing.

00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:28.694
But also they took all these
things that I've never watched

00:37:28.694 --> 00:37:31.822
in my life, like Dallas,
that used to be a big show and

00:37:31.822 --> 00:37:34.039
all these things;
I have no idea what they are.

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:36.304
But people--even our very dear
friends, you go there and

00:37:36.304 --> 00:37:39.505
they're watching this stuff.
Well, TV's not just American,

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:43.436
but that whole kind of culture
was identified with America,

00:37:43.436 --> 00:37:46.690
and intellectuals didn't like
that very much;

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.404
people should be reading
books-- and they should be

00:37:48.404 --> 00:37:49.809
reading books too,
but who am I to say?

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.510
I watch ESPN hours every day
and every game that's on,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.599
so I can't really say I don't
watch TV.

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:58.230
Clothing, it used to be--the
first years and years that I was

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.469
living in France or went to
France,

00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:03.949
you could tell who was an
American in about one second by

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.642
looking at their feet;
I don't spend a lot of time

00:38:06.642 --> 00:38:09.405
looking at people's feet but you
could tell the way they looked

00:38:09.405 --> 00:38:12.245
because they wore tennis shoes,
and tennis shoes now are called

00:38:12.245 --> 00:38:15.050
baskets.
But now everybody wears them

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.957
the same way.
And jeans the same thing,

00:38:16.957 --> 00:38:18.280
because there weren't jeans in
France;

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.205
now everybody wears jeans.
I can still tell who's American

00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:22.170
and who isn't,
usually.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:26.617
But the clothing that was
identified with America was seen

00:38:26.617 --> 00:38:30.904
as being somehow un-French.
And of course there's the big

00:38:30.904 --> 00:38:35.232
war between France high couture
of French fashion and trying to

00:38:35.232 --> 00:38:37.372
preserve,
as Milan tries to also,

00:38:37.372 --> 00:38:39.750
and they've been very
successful at that.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.480
But clothing was one thing as
well.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.193
Euro Disney,
what can one say about Euro

00:38:46.193 --> 00:38:48.789
Disney?
Somebody called it a cultural

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:51.890
Chernobyl;
Chernobyl was the big nuclear

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.854
plant that blew up in Kiev--and
certainly the idea of Mickey

00:38:56.854 --> 00:39:00.219
Mouse and Goofy and all these
people.

00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:03.245
And you go and you-- I've never
been there, I would never walk

00:39:03.245 --> 00:39:05.258
in the place;
you spend cinquante

00:39:05.258 --> 00:39:08.486
balles, you've spent,
what, fifty euros to get in and

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:11.829
so your kids can get sick eating
American cotton candy.

00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:14.640
But, again, people go over the
top.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.766
Or McDonald's, ha ha.
McDonald's, which started in

00:39:18.766 --> 00:39:22.250
France really in the '80s.
Burger King tried and failed.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.322
Now, McDonald's is a big issue,
and José

00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:26.124
Bové,
who came to Yale a couple of

00:39:26.124 --> 00:39:28.196
years ago--José
Bové is a guy who

00:39:28.196 --> 00:39:31.349
now--who became identified with
the struggle against McDonald's.

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:34.036
He actually lived two years in
L.A., though he speaks

00:39:34.036 --> 00:39:36.000
English--I wasn't here when he
came,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.152
my daughter was a translator
for him, and introduced him and

00:39:39.152 --> 00:39:42.026
all that.
But he's the one who led the

00:39:42.026 --> 00:39:46.761
struggle to try to first of all
to preserve his part of the

00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:49.872
Aveyron,
Larzac, against making it a

00:39:49.872 --> 00:39:53.969
strafing practice range for the
French Air Force,

00:39:53.969 --> 00:39:58.161
and has gone after McDonald's,
as representing the

00:39:58.161 --> 00:40:02.610
globalization that's going to
hurt local commerce.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.712
Now, McDonald's has tried to
compromise in some ways,

00:40:04.712 --> 00:40:06.653
and if you go get a
McDonald's--and I won't go in

00:40:06.653 --> 00:40:08.421
the place;
well, I shouldn't say that

00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:11.148
because we're recording this,
but I haven't been in years in

00:40:11.148 --> 00:40:13.828
France--but they have these
little salads with a few pieces

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:17.131
of goat cheese in it,
to go along with the two

00:40:17.131 --> 00:40:20.460
million calorie burger,
and all that.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.978
But what José
Bové did is that he and

00:40:22.978 --> 00:40:25.800
his friends went up and broke
up--didn't hurt anybody,

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.642
but they sort of trashed a
McDonald's in Millau,

00:40:29.642 --> 00:40:32.340
which is Aveyron,
in the south,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.468
right near this huge,
huge bridge,

00:40:34.468 --> 00:40:36.789
the biggest span bridge in
Europe.

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:39.835
And of course he went on trial
and he became a presidential

00:40:39.835 --> 00:40:42.670
candidate, and I guess--my
daughter said he was a great

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:47.699
guy.
But McDonald's became an issue.

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:50.380
And I said, "well,
maybe it won't work."

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.108
But McDonald's,
because you can eat cheaply

00:40:52.108 --> 00:40:54.289
there, because everything's so
expensive in France,

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:56.429
so expensive,
they're always just--well you

00:40:56.429 --> 00:40:58.620
could drive by,
there's one in Auvergnat,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.893
there's one everywhere;
they're always full of people

00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:04.440
eating whatever it is they eat
there.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.047
So, it became a symbol more
important than the reality,

00:41:08.047 --> 00:41:11.989
McDo--McDo, comme on dit en
français--became a

00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:15.056
symbol of globalization,
first of Americanization and

00:41:15.056 --> 00:41:17.872
then of globalization.
And then what comes along now

00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:19.949
but Starbucks.
There's three or four.

00:41:19.949 --> 00:41:23.308
There's one in the Marais in
Paris, there's one I saw

00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:26.835
in--some are on Opéra,
and there are a couple of other

00:41:26.835 --> 00:41:29.099
ones there, and they soon will
be everywhere.

00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:31.005
And even
hyper-marchés,

00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:33.170
supermarkets;
now, people don't just hate

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.199
supermarkets anymore,
but they used to.

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:38.076
The big ones are Leclerc,
and Auchan, and Mamouth and all

00:41:38.076 --> 00:41:41.004
these--Leclerc is probably the
biggest, I mean the upscale

00:41:41.004 --> 00:41:44.048
version, after Marché.
Now, I remember in the 1970s

00:41:44.048 --> 00:41:46.698
that people thought that
supermarkets were just terrible

00:41:46.698 --> 00:41:48.000
things.
Why?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.038
Because they were going to,
and did, destroy local

00:41:51.038 --> 00:41:54.385
commerce, that most villages now
do not have the little

00:41:54.385 --> 00:41:57.316
épicerie,
that grocery store,

00:41:57.316 --> 00:42:00.756
that made it possible for old
ladies just to walk the

00:42:00.756 --> 00:42:04.460
equivalent of a few hundred
meters to buy their milk,

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.429
and now they can't do that
anymore.

00:42:06.429 --> 00:42:09.403
Now, it's more than just the
disappearance of a way of buying

00:42:09.403 --> 00:42:12.426
food, it's the disappearance of
a place where you get together

00:42:12.426 --> 00:42:14.260
and exchange news in the
morning.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.757
Our grocery store disappeared
about ten years ago,

00:42:16.757 --> 00:42:19.509
or about eight years ago,
because everybody goes to the

00:42:19.509 --> 00:42:22.101
super-marché;
hyper-marché,

00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:24.389
super-marché,
c'est la même chose.

00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:27.369
Though the other thing that it
could attack,

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:30.557
could interfere with,
but has not as much as we

00:42:30.557 --> 00:42:32.011
feared,
were markets,

00:42:32.011 --> 00:42:34.300
the Saturday market,
the Wednesday market;

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.688
the Saturday and Wednesday
market, depending on the size of

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.849
the town, that are all over
France.

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:42.646
And in fact people still,
even young people your age,

00:42:42.646 --> 00:42:45.819
still have a sense that you've
got to protect--you've got to

00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:48.884
save the market and you've got
to--the people that produce

00:42:48.884 --> 00:42:51.281
there,
that bring what they produce in

00:42:51.281 --> 00:42:53.316
their fields there,
buy goats cheese,

00:42:53.316 --> 00:42:57.111
picodons,
whatever, wine from producers

00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:58.866
directly.
And that's part of the

00:42:58.866 --> 00:43:00.869
ambience, that's what's great
about living in France,

00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:02.657
or living in Germany,
or living in Pays-Bas,

00:43:02.657 --> 00:43:04.030
or living anywhere,
in Belgium.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:10.402
And, so, many people will go
and buy the big things of milk

00:43:10.402 --> 00:43:14.322
and the big items,
paper towels and all that,

00:43:14.322 --> 00:43:18.363
but then they will still go to
the market, not just for a trip

00:43:18.363 --> 00:43:21.079
of nostalgia but because the
products,

00:43:21.079 --> 00:43:23.349
they know they're buying from
people they know and all that;

00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:26.944
so that fear probably turned
out to be less than one had

00:43:26.944 --> 00:43:30.757
worried about.
And then of course there's the

00:43:30.757 --> 00:43:33.889
question of Franglais.
Every about,

00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:37.088
oh, maybe five,
or six, or seven years,

00:43:37.088 --> 00:43:41.465
somebody in one of the
ministries gets it into his or

00:43:41.465 --> 00:43:47.019
her head that Franglais has to
disappear from the vocabulary,

00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:50.297
the official vocabulary,
the administrative vocabulary

00:43:50.297 --> 00:43:54.683
of France.
Franglais is the absorption

00:43:54.683 --> 00:44:01.429
into daily parlance of words
that are non-French,

00:44:01.429 --> 00:44:05.778
of which--the first one that
really took over,

00:44:05.778 --> 00:44:10.320
at least in my memory,
was le weekend.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.633
And there were attempts,
I think under Giscard

00:44:13.633 --> 00:44:18.272
D'Estaing, and there's one even
more recently under early stages

00:44:18.272 --> 00:44:23.108
of Jacques Chirac's presidency,
to send stern circulars around

00:44:23.108 --> 00:44:27.400
saying in a correspondence you
shall not use le weekend,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.307
but you'd rather use la fin
de la semaine,

00:44:30.307 --> 00:44:33.981
the end of the week.
Well, that lasted a matter of

00:44:33.981 --> 00:44:38.099
days because that's simply not
terribly practical.

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:44.162
English words began to
permeate, with a sort of chic

00:44:44.162 --> 00:44:49.630
sense of being cool,
the French language--le

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:53.321
drugstore.
I can remember around Paris

00:44:53.321 --> 00:44:55.217
Saint-Germain,
at the metro there,

00:44:55.217 --> 00:44:57.688
en face,
right across there was le

00:44:57.688 --> 00:45:00.180
drugstore;
and it was, it was a pharmacy

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.837
and it had your basic green
flashing light saying it's a

00:45:02.837 --> 00:45:05.349
pharmacy, but they also sold all
sorts of things.

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:08.607
It was almost like anticipating
a supermarket,

00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:11.429
and the term was le
drugstore.

00:45:11.429 --> 00:45:15.366
It wasn't une pharmacie
or la pharmacie,

00:45:15.366 --> 00:45:19.130
it was le drugstore.
And people debated that.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.710
You could go on and on about
this.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.480
I'll just give you a couple of
examples;

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.861
these are obvious ones,
I just wrote them down because

00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:27.786
they're obvious.
Après les

00:45:27.786 --> 00:45:30.480
sweaters;
a sweater d'hiver;

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.782
voici les fully
fashioned des beaux

00:45:33.782 --> 00:45:36.515
jours;
new, c'est smart,

00:45:36.515 --> 00:45:39.774
s-m-a-r-t--vo
ilà--votre

00:45:39.774 --> 00:45:43.161
shopping club,
le veritable wash and wear,

00:45:43.161 --> 00:45:45.978
les drinks de gens
raffinés,

00:45:45.978 --> 00:45:48.869
the drink of people who are
refined.

00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:52.123
Now, this had already started
to happen in the 1890s with

00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:54.390
certain terms,
as I suggested when I was

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.539
talking about Émile
Henry,

00:45:56.539 --> 00:46:00.522
that began to--the long drink,
for example--that began to

00:46:00.522 --> 00:46:05.367
infiltrate the French language.
The hotdog became the chien

00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:09.780
chaud, in these times of
these various commands.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.378
But basically with
globalization and with the

00:46:14.378 --> 00:46:20.230
American cultural dominance,
these attempts are basically

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:25.559
just putting small fingers in
very large dykes.

00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:27.550
Why did it matter so much,
all of this?

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.416
It's because France is no
longer a great power,

00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:36.039
and intellectuals and lots of
other people in France,

00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:39.431
including me,
are determined that French

00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:42.909
culture retain its place in the
world.

00:46:42.909 --> 00:46:47.646
And I am chronically sad to see
another supermarket go up where

00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:50.550
there already have been two of
them;

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:57.905
it saddens me terribly to see
the golden arches almost

00:46:57.905 --> 00:47:01.929
everywhere now,
and Subway,

00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:05.050
which is a chain I actually
happen to like a lot,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.909
and those are becoming all over
the place.

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:13.171
So, we're fighting against the
ways that cannot be halted,

00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:17.510
but in a way may not be all a
very bad thing,

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.909
so long as a sense of
perspective is maintained;

00:47:20.909 --> 00:47:25.247
and that often was not
maintained in the early days of

00:47:25.247 --> 00:47:29.994
the almost hysterical battle
against the mounting empire of

00:47:29.994 --> 00:47:33.941
Coca-Cola.
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving

00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:38.000
vacation, see you next time,
and Go Blue.

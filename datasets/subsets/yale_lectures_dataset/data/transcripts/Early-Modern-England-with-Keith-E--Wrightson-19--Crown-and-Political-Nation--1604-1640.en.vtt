00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.817
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:05.439
Well, I want to attend today to
some of the political

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.910
developments of the early
seventeenth century.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.760
In reading about and discussing
the Tudor monarchy,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.645
we looked at the development of
a political system which was in

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:21.452
many ways highly centralized but
at the same time increasingly

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:24.210
participatory and consultative.
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.936
In certain matters of state the
royal will was supreme and the

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:33.430
prerogative power of the monarch
was paramount and yet,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.049
as Mark Kishlansky says,
"the constitutional

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.045
position was that monarchical
power was limited by the

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.760
evolution of its practice."
 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.110
The prerogative power of the
prince could not override the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.402
liberties of the subject
enshrined in law and the monarch

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:54.047
was also expected to have an eye
to the views and the interests

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:57.781
of the broader political nation,
those who governed the

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:01.965
localities and who acted,
in a sense, as brokers between

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:05.989
the royal administration and the
nation at large.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:10.256
Well, to that important extent
the effectiveness of government

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:14.242
and the maintenance of political
stability depended on the

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:18.650
relationships between the crown
and the 'political nation'.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.754
As we move in to the
seventeenth century the

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:26.373
essential point to grasp perhaps
is that these relationships were

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:27.530
never fixed.
 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.757
They contained certain gray
areas, there were certain

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:36.718
tensions, certain ambiguities,
and there was nothing new about

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:37.450
that.
 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.572
From time to time they'd
surfaced under Elizabeth and

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:45.379
they'd been on the whole handled
and resolved.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:49.120
In the final analysis the
interests of the crown and the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.519
political nation were expected
to run together,

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:56.599
and there was also a strong
emphasis in the political

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.700
culture of the time on trying to
achieve harmony and consensus.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.325
Open conflict was regarded as a
sign of failure in the political

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:08.218
process.
 

00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:14.545
And yet, despite all of that,
in the mid-seventeenth century

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:17.120
that system collapsed.
 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.551
In 1642, civil war broke out
between the crown and the

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:22.639
parliament.
 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:28.048
In 1649, King Charles I was put
on trial by a High Court of

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:33.735
Justice formed from parliament
and executed and a republic was

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:37.840
declared which lasted for over a
decade.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.888
Now these were political events
of quite extraordinary

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:45.020
radicalism for the seventeenth
century.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.819
Kings had been deposed and
replaced in the past;

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.692
kings had been killed in battle;
kings had sometimes been

00:02:54.692 --> 00:03:00.444
murdered by rival claimants;
but never before had a reigning

00:03:00.444 --> 00:03:06.146
monarch been formally put on
trial and called to account and

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:07.788
then executed.
 

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:11.663
As Oliver Cromwell,
one of the movers of that act,

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:16.171
put it, "we cut off the
king's head with the crown on

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:17.199
it."
 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.373
"We cut off the king's
head with the crown on it,"

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:25.619
by which he meant that they had
tried and executed not just a

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:30.949
man but an institution,
the institution of monarchy.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:36.560
Well, such momentous events
perhaps imply very profound

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.680
causes,
and as a result the political

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.128
history of the early seventeenth
century has traditionally been

00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:48.220
viewed as in many respects 'a
high road to civil war';

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.180
that's a phrase which is often
used.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.160
In looking at the development
of the situation,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.598
traditionally the so-called
'Whig' variant of the story

00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:04.449
tells a tale of an assertive
parliament increasingly anxious

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.217
to defend its privileges and
worried about the liberties of

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:14.479
the subject coming into conflict
with monarchs who were trying to

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.920
extend the sphere of royal
prerogative power,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.348
and as a result parliament
fought back by demanding greater

00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:23.649
influence on policy.
 

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.699
That's the essentials of the
traditional story.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.019
There's a Marxist variant on
that too,

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.980
which argues that behind these
political developments,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.220
behind the assertiveness of
parliament,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.783
was a growth in the social and
economic power of the gentry and

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.579
of the urban elites of the
country,

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:47.319
people who had done well out of
economic change and were seeking

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.569
a greater place in the sun,
expressing their aspirations in

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.949
a developing rhetoric of the
liberties of the subject.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.829
In the 1970s and 1980s,
however, a more conservative,

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:03.879
so-called 'revisionist' school
of historians rejected these

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.209
interpretations of the high road
to civil war and began arguing

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:12.120
that they were essentially the
product of hindsight.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.026
In the view of this school
there was no deep-rooted malaise

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:21.882
in the English body politic,
no great clash of fundamental

00:05:21.882 --> 00:05:26.189
constitutional principles,
no high road to civil war.

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.913
Rather, as they tell the story,
the catastrophe of the 1640s

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:35.317
was the result of short-term
misjudgments and unforeseen

00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:40.132
contingent circumstances,
almost a tragic accident,

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:45.730
though one which came to have
very profound consequences.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.259
Well, there's no need to
rehearse all the details of

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.550
these debates at length.
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.670
If they interest you,
then the introduction to Cust

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.153
and Hughes' book,
Conflict in Early Stuart

00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:57.817
England,
is an excellent overview of

00:05:57.817 --> 00:06:00.810
the way the historiography has
developed.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.098
But these debates continue and
they continue in a sense because

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:11.300
the English civil wars are still
being fought on paper because

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.992
the seventeenth century was a
defining moment in British

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.040
political history.
 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.523
Nevertheless,
at the moment we seem to be in

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:23.930
a phase of what's sometimes
described as post-revisionism in

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.221
which historians of the period
are increasingly willing to

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.110
recognize the merits of
different arguments.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.797
First of all that the
traditional interpretation was

00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:37.413
perhaps a little too
teleological and that the role

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:41.680
of short-term contingency was
neglected in that story,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.615
but on the other hand,
recognizing that in its more

00:06:45.615 --> 00:06:49.788
extreme manifestations
revisionism is almost willfully

00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:52.779
shortsighted as an
interpretation.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.795
Above all, it fails to take
account of the larger context of

00:06:56.795 --> 00:07:00.744
political life in the nation and
of the changing social and

00:07:00.744 --> 00:07:04.420
cultural context within which
politics took place.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.815
As a result,
it's been said by some critics

00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:10.295
that the revisionist approach
tends to explain why the English

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:12.177
civil wars shouldn't have
happened

00:07:12.177 --> 00:07:13.889
&gt;
 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.810
But they did happen.
 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.569
They can't explain why people
felt so passionately that they

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.490
were willing to draw sword
against their fellow countrymen.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.990
So we mustn't assume a
particular preordained direction

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.351
of events;
we mustn't imply an

00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:35.720
inevitability about the process.
 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.416
We have to be alive to the
importance in politics of

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:43.550
contingent circumstances and the
interventions of specific

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.709
individuals.
 

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:50.678
But at the same time we have to
remain aware of the fact that

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:56.747
short-term conflicts can have a
cumulative effect and politics

00:07:56.747 --> 00:08:02.319
was not conducted in a social or
ideological vacuum.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.762
Well, to stand back from that
for a moment and bring the story

00:08:06.762 --> 00:08:09.750
through from the accession of
James I,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.213
one thing one can say with
certainty and that's that in

00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:16.997
1603 when King James came down
from Scotland and was crowned

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:20.461
King of England no one
anticipated the trouble that was

00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:21.360
to come.
 

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.077
On the contrary,
the mood of the political

00:08:24.077 --> 00:08:27.589
nation in 1603 was by and large
one of celebration.

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:31.422
They had an adult monarch,
an experienced king who'd ruled

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:34.313
well in Scotland;
he was a firm Protestant,

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:35.669
and he had two sons.
 

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.090
Everything looked great.
 

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.820
Given the nature of the
political system,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.533
the tone of James' reign
depended very much upon the

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:47.232
personality of the monarch,
and James on the whole was

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:50.793
capable of negotiating the
ambiguities of the

00:08:50.793 --> 00:08:54.029
constitutional situation pretty
well.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:57.691
There were certainly some
tensions in his relationships

00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.200
with parliament when it was
called.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.361
The English parliament,
very aware of James'

00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:07.826
unfamiliarity with its system,
was jealous of its privileges,

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.830
anxious that the new monarch
should be brought to understand

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.070
them correctly as it saw them.
 

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.801
It was rather critical of the
King's use of his prerogative

00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:21.662
power to raise customs revenues
by so-called 'impositions' on

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:24.221
trade,
and at the same time it was

00:09:24.221 --> 00:09:28.059
deeply suspicious of any
financial innovation which might

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:31.418
make the crown more independent
of parliament.

00:09:31.418 --> 00:09:34.618
In 1610, for example,
parliament rejected plans for

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:37.048
what was called the Great
Contract,

00:09:37.048 --> 00:09:41.594
which would have granted to the
king a regular annual taxation

00:09:41.594 --> 00:09:46.139
income in return for abolishing
certain antiquated and archaic

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.629
feudal revenues.
 

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.649
It failed.
 

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:53.740
They were too anxious to
maintain control of the purse

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.950
for it to go through.
 

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.015
On the King's part,
James had a very high

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.928
conception of his royal
prerogative.

00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:05.274
He regarded the privileges of
parliament as having been

00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:09.240
granted by his ancestors in the
past for particular purposes,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.125
rather than being fundamental
features of a mythical 'ancient

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:16.690
constitution' as some members of
parliament believed.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.817
He was certainly not used to
having such an

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:23.690
independent-minded body as the
English parliament.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.197
Scotland had a parliament but
it was very much under the

00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:28.600
control of the king.
 

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.913
He was prone at times to
lecturing the members of

00:10:30.913 --> 00:10:33.759
parliament when he believed them
to have encroached upon his

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.513
sovereignty,
but of course Elizabeth had

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:38.158
done that in her time.
 

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:42.442
James was also ready to use his
power to dissolve parliament

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.129
when he became exasperated with
it.

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:48.470
And certainly he didn't call it
very often.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.303
But, nevertheless,
if James had any pretensions to

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:56.058
absolute power they were
strictly theoretical.

00:10:56.058 --> 00:11:00.767
He is once recorded as having
told the Spanish ambassador in a

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:05.321
conversation that he marveled
that his ancestors had created

00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:08.639
such a body as the English
parliament,

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:12.251
but he had found it in being
when he came to the throne and

00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:15.990
he was obliged to put up with
what he couldn't get rid of.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.056
And so he did,
like the shrewd and canny

00:11:20.056 --> 00:11:22.350
monarch that he was.
 

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.972
More broadly,
if there were those amongst the

00:11:24.972 --> 00:11:28.312
political nation who were a
little disappointed with King

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:31.950
James after the early years once
the honeymoon was over,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.083
who came to dislike the
sometimes rather sleazy tone of

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:39.230
his court,
who disliked his fondness for

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.291
favorites,
or his notorious financial

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:46.187
extravagance;
nonetheless there's no reason

00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:51.833
to believe that the consensual
political system was under any

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:55.408
unusual strain during James'
reign.

00:11:55.408 --> 00:12:01.480
But if that was the case it
didn't survive the 1620s.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:07.205
The 1620s turned out to be a
decade of mounting crisis and

00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:12.153
acute political polarization,
a polarization which was

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:15.836
vividly reflected in the
relations between crown and

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.649
parliament,
and this situation arose from a

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:19.990
combination of factors.
 

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.360
It partly involved foreign
policy difficulties.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.580
It partly involved religion.
 

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.240
It partly involved engagement
in war;

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.192
and taxation;
perceived threats to the common

00:12:32.192 --> 00:12:32.600
law.
 

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.538
And it all came to a focus on
the person of one man;

00:12:37.538 --> 00:12:42.658
George Villiers,
the Duke of Buckingham.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:46.519
Now Buckingham was a handsome
young man,

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:49.269
rather charismatic by all
accounts,

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:55.038
who had come to court and
attracted James I's attention in

00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:56.759
the late 1610s.
 

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:02.163
Becoming favorite of the king,
he had been rapidly advanced to

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:04.288
titles and to fortune.
 

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:09.220
Well, had he just been James'
toy boy, this would not have

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.457
mattered very much,
but the trouble was Buckingham

00:13:13.457 --> 00:13:16.399
was anxious to exercise power.
 

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:19.654
By the early 1620s,
he not only held high office

00:13:19.654 --> 00:13:23.533
but he was also using his
position to become increasingly

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.860
dominant in the control of royal
patronage,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.028
with all that that meant.
 

00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:34.029
Moreover, his ascendancy well
established in the later years

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:37.928
of King James survived the old
king's death.

00:13:37.928 --> 00:13:42.614
Buckingham also dazzled Prince
Charles and retained his

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:47.818
position as royal favorite when
Charles came to the throne in

00:13:47.818 --> 00:13:48.600
1625.
 

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.941
By 1628, he appears to have had
virtually a monopoly over

00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:56.038
influence on policy.
 

00:13:56.038 --> 00:14:00.568
Together with that,
his manifest incompetence

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:06.538
rendered him odious in the eyes
of the political nation.

00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:08.902
Sir Edward Coke,
the lord chief justice,

00:14:08.902 --> 00:14:11.628
described Buckingham as
"the grievance of

00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:12.899
grievances."
 

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:17.188
He was beginning to be seen in
the eyes of some of the

00:14:17.188 --> 00:14:21.639
political nation as the
quintessential bad councilor.

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:25.293
So Buckingham came to provide
something of a focus for

00:14:25.293 --> 00:14:29.291
deteriorating relations between
the crown and the political

00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:30.048
nation.
 

00:14:30.048 --> 00:14:34.538
But the broad context for that
deterioration was provided by

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:37.658
other events,
notably events in Europe.

00:14:37.658 --> 00:14:40.779
The outbreak in 1618 of the
Thirty Years War,

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:45.149
the expulsion from his lands of
James I's son-in-law,

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:48.519
the Protestant elector of the
Palatinate,

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:53.057
and the triumphant advance in
the 1620s of the Catholic forces

00:14:53.057 --> 00:14:56.629
of the Hapsburg monarchs of
Austria and Spain;

00:14:56.629 --> 00:15:01.759
events which were very
anxiously followed by many

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:05.500
English gentlemen,
as we've seen.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.283
It was essentially the question
of England's potential

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.783
involvement or actual
involvement in this European

00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:16.711
crisis which led to the
summoning of so many parliaments

00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:19.931
in the 1620s,
and it was the conduct of

00:15:19.931 --> 00:15:23.874
affairs under Buckingham which
led members of parliament

00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:28.030
increasingly to try to exert
greater influence over matters

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.931
which were,
strictly speaking,

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:34.200
matters for the royal
prerogative.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.682
And that was the situation
which began the slide into

00:15:39.682 --> 00:15:41.370
confrontation.
 

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:47.711
To sum it all up briefly,
there were five parliaments

00:15:47.711 --> 00:15:50.639
between 1621 and 1629.
 

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:55.131
Three of them were dissolved
acrimoniously after quarrels

00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:57.860
between the King and parliament.
 

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.658
On three occasions the King
acrimoniously dissolved

00:16:00.658 --> 00:16:02.450
parliament and sent them home.
 

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.754
The cause of all this was
parliament's attempts to exert

00:16:06.754 --> 00:16:10.903
influence on policy in
prerogative matters of state as

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:14.740
the King saw them:
matters of foreign policy;

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.980
matters concerning the marriage
of Prince Charles;

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.952
matters concerning the choice
of royal ministers to conduct

00:16:23.952 --> 00:16:28.048
policy;
and matters concerning religion.

00:16:28.048 --> 00:16:31.759
This developing atmosphere of
conflict was made worse when,

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:35.894
after 1626, King Charles
resorted to measures of

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:40.908
questionable legality in order
to sustain his policies.

00:16:40.908 --> 00:16:44.625
And such conflict was fought
out in parliament after

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:48.923
parliament through assertions of
parliamentary privilege and

00:16:48.923 --> 00:16:53.440
constitutional principle which
were met by the use of the royal

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.301
prerogative to dissolve
parliament and silence critics

00:16:57.301 --> 00:16:59.048
of royal policy.
 

00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:03.663
That's the essence of it all,
but let's run through some of

00:17:03.663 --> 00:17:08.116
the sort of 'edited highlights'
of what happened in these

00:17:08.116 --> 00:17:09.390
parliaments.
 

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.730
The essence of it all is on
your handout.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.568
In 1621, parliament was called
to grant money for some form of

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:21.457
action to support the Protestant
Elector Palatine,

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:23.598
King James' son-in-law.
 

00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:28.032
Parliament voted a modest
subsidy to support armies for

00:17:28.032 --> 00:17:32.467
the Palatinate but also
petitioned James to declare war

00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:36.982
on Spain and to abandon the
plans which he had formed to

00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:41.663
marry Prince Charles to a
Spanish princess and to assure a

00:17:41.663 --> 00:17:44.619
Protestant marriage instead.
 

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:47.140
King James was furious.
 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.410
His plan for a marriage with
Spain was part of a larger

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.680
scheme to try to end the
polarization within Europe.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.038
It was part of his scheme for
securing good relations with

00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:02.634
Spain which might help forward a
negotiated settlement and the

00:18:02.634 --> 00:18:07.173
withdrawal of Spanish troops,
and he forbade the commons to

00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:09.710
meddle in this grand design.
 

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.934
The commons responded by
declaring that the King was

00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:16.046
interfering with--
I'm quoting--"the ancient

00:18:16.046 --> 00:18:18.940
liberty of parliament for
freedom of speech...

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.548
the same being our ancient and
undoubted right and an

00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:25.880
inheritance received from our
ancestors."

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.057
James replied that their
liberty of free speech was

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:33.059
derived from "the grace and
permission of our ancestors and

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:36.428
us" and should not be
abused by the parliament in

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:37.890
matters of state.
 

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.650
There was uproar.
 

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.098
The House of Commons composed a
protest,

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:45.226
the so-called Protestation,
saying that their privileges

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:48.636
were 'the ancient and undoubted
birthright and inheritance of

00:18:48.636 --> 00:18:50.568
the subjects of England."
 

00:18:50.568 --> 00:18:54.950
James responded by dissolving
Parliament and he personally

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:00.098
ripped the Protestation from the
journal of the House of Commons.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:04.643
Well, James did not go to war
with Spain as parliament desired

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:08.890
and he persisted with his plans
for a Spanish marriage.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.111
In 1623, Prince Charles
accompanied by Buckingham went

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:16.694
to Spain in order to woo the
Spanish princess,

00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:17.970
the Infanta.
 

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.846
This occasioned massive anxiety
in England followed by

00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:28.093
widespread public rejoicing when
the marriage negotiations

00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:30.670
eventually fell through.
 

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.344
Humiliated by their failure,
Charles and Buckingham now

00:19:35.344 --> 00:19:40.364
began to exert their influence
to back the idea of war with

00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:41.230
Spain.
 

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.440
In 1624, parliament was called
again.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:50.605
It voted money to the crown but
withheld the finance bill until

00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:55.078
war was reluctantly declared by
King James.

00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:59.960
And England entered the war in
alliance with France,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.772
an alliance which involved the
marriage of Prince Charles to

00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:05.070
the French princess,
Henrietta Maria,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:10.018
sister of the King of France,
a Catholic who arrived in

00:20:10.018 --> 00:20:15.673
England with a Catholic
entourage including priests and

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.140
confessors.
 

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.740
In 1625, Charles came to the
throne.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.730
He was now aged twenty-five.
 

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.415
Parliament met at the beginning
of the reign as was customary

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:31.548
and voted money for the
continuation of the war,

00:20:31.548 --> 00:20:35.930
but it failed to grant the King
the usual grant of customs

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.390
revenue for life.
 

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.727
This was because parliament was
unhappy about recent customs

00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:45.769
impositions which didn't have
parliamentary sanction.

00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:49.048
In September of that year,
September of 1625,

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:52.769
the Duke of Buckingham led an
English naval expedition to

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:55.160
attack the Spanish port of
Cadiz,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.221
attempting to emulate the great
feat of Francis Drake when he

00:20:59.221 --> 00:21:03.957
had attacked Cadiz in the 1580s,
but Buckingham was not Francis

00:21:03.957 --> 00:21:04.509
Drake.
 

00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:10.105
His expedition was an utter
failure, demonstrating gross

00:21:10.105 --> 00:21:14.990
military incompetence on the
part of the Duke.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:19.218
Following that humiliation,
in 1626 parliament met again to

00:21:19.218 --> 00:21:21.259
provide money for the war.
 

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:25.205
It proved willing to vote
supply to the crown but it

00:21:25.205 --> 00:21:29.693
demanded that its grievances
should be rectified before the

00:21:29.693 --> 00:21:32.480
finance bill was finally passed.
 

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.130
And the grievances were above
all a torrent of hostility

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:42.880
towards Buckingham and other new
councilors influencing the King,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.230
notably the Arminian bishops
who were being brought in to the

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.390
privy council.
 

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.068
The Commons proceeded to try to
draw up articles of impeachment

00:21:53.068 --> 00:21:56.240
against Buckingham for his
incompetence.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.420
Charles attempted to halt them
by illegally imprisoning several

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.938
members of the House of Commons,
and when that failed he again

00:22:04.938 --> 00:22:09.553
dissolved parliament in order to
save the Duke from impeachment

00:22:09.553 --> 00:22:10.670
proceedings.
 

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.400
No money was granted.
 

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.019
In need of money to finance the
war, Charles and Buckingham now

00:22:20.019 --> 00:22:23.000
decided to levy a massive forced
loan.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.970
They simply levied what was
officially a loan,

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.821
in fact an illegal tax,
on the taxpaying section of the

00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:33.567
political nation,
claiming the King's right to do

00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:37.307
this by prerogative power in
conditions of national

00:22:37.307 --> 00:22:38.279
emergency.
 

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:42.653
Over seventy members of the
gentry refused to pay and were

00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:46.259
imprisoned by the King's special
commandment;

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:51.568
again a use of prerogative
power, imprisoned without trial.

00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:54.967
To make matters worse,
Buckingham now secured a

00:22:54.967 --> 00:22:59.326
declaration of war not only
against Spain but against France

00:22:59.326 --> 00:23:03.683
also and squandered the forced
loan money by leading another

00:23:03.683 --> 00:23:07.942
disastrous naval expedition,
this time to aid French

00:23:07.942 --> 00:23:12.383
Protestants who were rebelling
against Louis XIII of France in

00:23:12.383 --> 00:23:16.750
the city of La Rochelle on the
coast of southwest France;

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.808
another military disaster.
 

00:23:21.808 --> 00:23:25.931
This deteriorating situation
finally came to a head in 1628

00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:26.500
to '9.
 

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.394
Parliament was called again,
again to raise money,

00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.940
and it met in an ominous mood.
 

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.170
Sir Benjamin Rudyard,
one of the members,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.471
declared, "this is the
crisis of parliaments:

00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:44.211
we shall know by this whether
parliaments shall live or

00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:45.440
die."
 

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.538
The House of Commons started by
promising to vote the King a

00:23:49.538 --> 00:23:53.499
large sum of money but again
insisted that their grievance

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:57.460
issue be heard before the
finance bill was finalized.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.405
Again there was a torrent of
complaint concerning grievances

00:24:01.405 --> 00:24:05.419
arising from the forced loan and
the conduct of the war under

00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:08.548
Buckingham,
and finally all of this was

00:24:08.548 --> 00:24:12.358
encapsulated in the so-called
Petition of Right,

00:24:12.358 --> 00:24:15.873
the Petition of Right,
which was presented to the King

00:24:15.873 --> 00:24:19.452
requesting that he confirm the
liberties of the subject

00:24:19.452 --> 00:24:23.098
threatened by the recent conduct
of his government.

00:24:23.098 --> 00:24:25.926
Specifically,
there should be no taxation

00:24:25.926 --> 00:24:30.634
without parliamentary consent;
there should be no arbitrary

00:24:30.634 --> 00:24:34.798
arrest of subjects;
there should be no billeting of

00:24:34.798 --> 00:24:38.230
troops upon subjects without
their consent;

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.174
there should be no government
of the localities by martial

00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:44.665
law,
which is something which had

00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:48.463
occurred in the areas of the
kingdom where troops were

00:24:48.463 --> 00:24:51.690
billeted prior to Buckingham's
expedition.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.558
In order to get the necessary
money,

00:24:54.558 --> 00:24:59.180
Charles reluctantly agreed to
the Petition of Right,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.453
though insisting that in doing
so he was not surrendering any

00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:05.450
of his prerogative powers.
 

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.380
That was in June 1628.
 

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.038
Parliament then adjourned and
went into recess,

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:16.849
and before it met again the
Duke of Buckingham was

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:22.838
assassinated in August 1628 by
one of his former officers,

00:25:22.838 --> 00:25:27.971
an event which was greeted by
almost universal public

00:25:27.971 --> 00:25:31.028
rejoicing throughout England.
 

00:25:31.028 --> 00:25:34.997
One of the few exceptions to
that rejoicing being King

00:25:34.997 --> 00:25:39.136
Charles himself,
who was profoundly grieved by

00:25:39.136 --> 00:25:44.103
the loss of his friend and
deeply bitter about the way

00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:49.631
Buckingham's murder had been
greeted with virtual dancing in

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:53.380
the streets throughout the
kingdom.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.863
In January 1629,
parliament reconvened and

00:25:57.863 --> 00:26:01.690
attempted to press its
advantage.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.107
There was a vigorous attack
upon the recently promoted

00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:09.041
Arminian bishops in the church
who were accused of introducing

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:13.450
popish innovations,
as we heard last time.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.395
There was the use of the
Petition of Right to attack the

00:26:17.395 --> 00:26:20.838
illegality of Charles'
collection of customs,

00:26:20.838 --> 00:26:24.776
which he had continued to
collect despite the fact that

00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:29.150
parliament had not confirmed its
grant of customs revenue.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.038
Charles decided to halt
parliament's sitting in this

00:26:33.038 --> 00:26:35.705
situation,
but when the Speaker of the

00:26:35.705 --> 00:26:39.121
House of Commons was told to
announce the dissolution of

00:26:39.121 --> 00:26:42.661
parliament to the Commons he was
held down in his chair by

00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:44.400
several of the members.
 

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.170
They refused to allow him to
announce the dissolution.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.731
The door of the House of
Commons was shut against the

00:26:51.731 --> 00:26:55.088
King's messenger and barred
until the Commons,

00:26:55.088 --> 00:26:59.996
led by Sir John Eliot,
put forward three resolutions

00:26:59.996 --> 00:27:01.440
to the House.
 

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.160
First of all the resolution
that anyone furthering

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.589
"popery or
Arminianism"

00:27:07.589 --> 00:27:11.310
was to be considered "a
capital enemy to this

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.209
kingdom";
secondly that whoever advised

00:27:15.209 --> 00:27:19.803
the King to collect customs
revenue without parliamentary

00:27:19.803 --> 00:27:25.298
consent would also be considered
a capital enemy to the kingdom;

00:27:25.298 --> 00:27:29.553
thirdly that anyone paying
these duties was "an enemy

00:27:29.553 --> 00:27:32.240
to the liberties of
England."

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.865
These three resolutions were
passed by acclamation in the

00:27:36.865 --> 00:27:41.079
House of Commons and Charles
responded by dissolving

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:42.318
parliament.
 

00:27:42.318 --> 00:27:49.190
It didn't meet again for eleven
years.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.259
Now, it's been suggested in
recent years that we shouldn't

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:57.402
really make too much of all of
this: that the conflict that

00:27:57.402 --> 00:28:01.615
scarred political life in the
1620s was sporadic rather than

00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:04.383
continuous;
that it was a product of

00:28:04.383 --> 00:28:07.878
particular circumstances,
in the conduct of the wars in

00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:10.855
particular, rather than a
reflection of growing

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:15.009
ideological division;
that consensual values still

00:28:15.009 --> 00:28:19.156
held their power,
that the leaders of parliament

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:24.538
did not constitute an organized
and coherent opposition to the

00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:25.509
crown.
 

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:29.212
These arguments need to be
taken seriously,

00:28:29.212 --> 00:28:33.446
but for myself I can say I
don't really find them

00:28:33.446 --> 00:28:34.769
convincing.
 

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:37.990
Certainly, the conflicts did
arise from the contingent

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.846
circumstances surrounding
particular meetings of

00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:43.318
parliament,
and certainly the members of

00:28:43.318 --> 00:28:46.156
the political nation would have
preferred a consensual

00:28:46.156 --> 00:28:48.460
relationship with the royal
government--

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.134
they repeatedly showed their
willingness to grant the taxes

00:28:52.134 --> 00:28:55.048
necessary for the war on certain
conditions;

00:28:55.048 --> 00:28:58.710
they would have liked to
establish a new consensus.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.790
But the 1620s had also
witnessed the enmeshing of a

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.690
variety of sources of discontent
with Charles' government.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.193
The political nation was
becoming seriously divided over

00:29:12.193 --> 00:29:17.026
a number of fundamental issues
which recur repeatedly and an

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:22.348
ideological fissure was emerging
over certain key questions,

00:29:22.348 --> 00:29:27.955
such as: the extent to which
the King's prerogative powers

00:29:27.955 --> 00:29:33.425
were or were not limited by law;
the scope of parliament's

00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:38.782
legitimate role in advising the
crown and representing the views

00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:43.421
of the political nation;
the question of whether the

00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:48.710
principle of taxation by consent
would be maintained or not;

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.634
the question of whether the
ecclesiastical policy being

00:29:52.634 --> 00:29:55.601
pursued by the crown,
with the appointment of

00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:59.363
Arminian bishops,
was or was not undermining

00:29:59.363 --> 00:30:01.798
English Protestantism.
 

00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:04.846
Now all of those issues,
which do recur,

00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:07.578
add up to a pretty heady
mixture.

00:30:07.578 --> 00:30:12.068
It's a formidable cocktail of
anxieties.

00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:15.385
And, as you know,
these anxieties were widely

00:30:15.385 --> 00:30:20.210
shared well outside the confines
of the houses of parliament,

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.640
widely shared by a broad and
growing political public which

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.257
was informed by novel means of
political news reporting which

00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:36.220
emphasized not consensus but
danger and conflict.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.944
The emergence of a broad public
opinion which expected

00:30:39.944 --> 00:30:44.163
parliament to act to remedy its
concerns was surely something

00:30:44.163 --> 00:30:48.521
which was part and parcel of the
deterioration of relationships

00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:52.670
between the crown and the
political nation at large--

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:57.640
and the fact that not all of
those who learned of what was

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.347
happening at the center were
necessarily sympathetic to

00:31:02.347 --> 00:31:07.318
parliament deepened the emerging
political division in the

00:31:07.318 --> 00:31:08.538
country.
 

00:31:08.538 --> 00:31:12.883
No one who took a serious
interest in political affairs at

00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:16.921
this time could really fail to
be aware that there was

00:31:16.921 --> 00:31:20.883
something of a functional
breakdown in the consensual

00:31:20.883 --> 00:31:24.160
political system by the later
1620s,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.351
and of course they had to
explain to themselves what was

00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:30.390
going on.
 

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.759
Two influential interpretations
of that,

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:38.407
by Peter Lake and Jonathan
Scott, have argued that people

00:31:38.407 --> 00:31:42.891
explained the situation to
themselves with reference to

00:31:42.891 --> 00:31:47.623
what have been described as two
"similar but mutually

00:31:47.623 --> 00:31:51.108
exclusive conspiracy
theories."

00:31:51.108 --> 00:31:54.717
To those who sympathized with
parliament and particular to the

00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:58.680
leaders of the House of Commons
like Sir John Eliot or John Pym,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.407
the erosion of consensus was
attributable to what they

00:32:03.407 --> 00:32:08.403
described as a popish plot
amongst evil councilors of the

00:32:08.403 --> 00:32:13.488
crown who were hostile to
English Protestantism and to the

00:32:13.488 --> 00:32:19.107
liberties of the subject and who
were favorable to absolutism or

00:32:19.107 --> 00:32:23.480
arbitrary power in both church
and state.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.288
They associated together popery
and arbitrary power,

00:32:29.288 --> 00:32:33.580
which was to prove a dominant
theme in seventeenth-century

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.022
English oppositional politics
that association of affairs in

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:41.992
church and state,
popery and arbitrary power,

00:32:41.992 --> 00:32:44.049
was already being made.
 

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:47.288
That was one conspiracy theory.
 

00:32:47.288 --> 00:32:50.983
On the other hand,
amongst people who recoiled

00:32:50.983 --> 00:32:55.910
from what they had begun to see
as parliament's excesses,

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:59.982
especially the scenes in 1629,
the fault lay not with

00:32:59.982 --> 00:33:04.761
crypto-papists around the king
but with what they described as

00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:08.680
"popular spirits":
popular spirits,

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.645
populists, radicals who failed
to respect the proper legitimate

00:33:13.645 --> 00:33:17.892
rights of the crown and who were
making constitutional

00:33:17.892 --> 00:33:22.057
encroachments upon them and
whose attempts to achieve

00:33:22.057 --> 00:33:26.064
greater 'popularity' in
government were linked to a

00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:30.308
preference for 'popularity' in
religion also.

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:36.382
Which is to say they saw them
as crypto-Presbyterians,

00:33:36.382 --> 00:33:39.588
Puritans, popular spirits.
 

00:33:39.588 --> 00:33:44.728
That was the view of those who
swung increasingly to the King's

00:33:44.728 --> 00:33:46.798
side in these quarrels.
 

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:51.612
But with the dissolution of
parliament in 1629 the forum for

00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:56.507
the public expression of the
first of these sets of anxieties

00:33:56.507 --> 00:33:58.220
had been removed.
 

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.259
Parliament was no longer there,
and the conduct of government

00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:06.298
lay with people like Archbishop
Laud or Thomas Wentworth,

00:34:06.298 --> 00:34:11.059
the Earl of Strafford,
who shared the second view.

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:14.282
Wentworth in particular was a
man who had been vehemently

00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:16.987
opposed as a member of
parliament to the Duke of

00:34:16.987 --> 00:34:20.764
Buckingham,
but who recoiled in 1629 from

00:34:20.764 --> 00:34:26.672
what he took to be the excesses
of parliament threatening the

00:34:26.672 --> 00:34:28.840
breakdown of order.
 

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.291
Laud and Wentworth proved
strong allies of the King who

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:38.155
himself of course took the view
that popular spirits were at

00:34:38.155 --> 00:34:43.266
work and was determined not to
call another parliament in which

00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:48.789
they could express their voice
if he could possibly avoid it.

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:53.934
So, with the dissolution of
1629, to Charles and his

00:34:53.934 --> 00:34:59.989
advisers the 1630s represented
something of a fresh start.

00:34:59.989 --> 00:35:05.005
Peace was made first of all
with France in 1629 and then

00:35:05.005 --> 00:35:06.920
with Spain in 1630.
 

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.909
In Europe the situation was
becoming less threatening.

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:16.139
In 1629, the Protestant King of
Sweden intervened in Germany,

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:22.239
and then in 1635 France under
Cardinal Richelieu intervened,

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:26.956
and together that greatly
lessened the threat of Hapsburg

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:31.170
domination and a triumphant
counter-reformation.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:36.563
At home Charles was determined
to close down the consultative

00:35:36.563 --> 00:35:41.599
and participatory dimensions of
the political process.

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.398
He believed that it had led
only to obstruction,

00:35:45.398 --> 00:35:50.088
disruption, and conflict and he
would have no more of it if

00:35:50.088 --> 00:35:51.139
possible.
 

00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:56.059
But he was also determined to
rule well according to his own

00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:56.809
lights.
 

00:35:56.809 --> 00:36:00.623
In 1631, following a harvest
crisis he issued a Book of

00:36:00.623 --> 00:36:04.295
Orders which tightened up the
administration of local

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:07.969
government with particular
attention to the efficient

00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:12.206
enforcement of the poor laws and
a great deal was achieved in

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:13.690
that respect.
 

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.422
Steps were also taken by the
royal government to remedy some

00:36:17.422 --> 00:36:20.775
of the deficiencies which had
emerged in the course of

00:36:20.775 --> 00:36:24.699
Buckingham's unsuccessful
military campaigns in the 1620s.

00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:27.360
Steps were taken to reform the
militia,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.469
to institute the training to a
higher level of military

00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:34.440
preparedness of part of the
militia,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.543
and steps were also instituted
to rebuild and strengthen the

00:36:39.543 --> 00:36:40.150
navy.
 

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.268
All of these things were very
much to the King's credit,

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:50.402
and yet in other respects he
can be said to have confirmed

00:36:50.402 --> 00:36:55.889
some of the worst fears of his
opponents in 1629.

00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:58.954
As you know,
Arminianism continued to be

00:36:58.954 --> 00:37:03.590
ruthlessly promoted in the
church under Archbishop Laud,

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:08.429
who became Archbishop of
Canterbury of course in 1633.

00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:12.702
In the absence of parliamentary
grants of taxation,

00:37:12.702 --> 00:37:17.661
the King also resorted to a
variety of financial expedients

00:37:17.661 --> 00:37:21.079
which were of questionable
legality.

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:22.440
There were many of these.
 

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.103
One for example was so-called
"distraint of

00:37:25.103 --> 00:37:26.179
knighthood."
 

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:30.454
By this the King revived an
ancient feudal law under which

00:37:30.454 --> 00:37:34.804
landholders of a certain level
of wealth were fined if they

00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:39.679
didn't present themselves before
the king to be made knights.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:43.438
He was digging up a medieval
precedent in order to squeeze

00:37:43.438 --> 00:37:46.869
money out of certain members of
the landed gentry.

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:49.010
It was deeply resented.
 

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:53.458
New customs impositions were
introduced, of course without

00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:55.409
parliamentary sanction.
 

00:37:55.409 --> 00:38:00.492
Efforts were made to search for
and revive any royal rights over

00:38:00.492 --> 00:38:05.333
land which could be sources of
income by obliging landholders

00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:10.014
to meet 'compositions' with the
King in order to have royal

00:38:10.014 --> 00:38:13.380
rights relaxed,
again digging in to the

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.978
medieval past for precedents
which could be exploited

00:38:16.978 --> 00:38:17.809
fiscally.
 

00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:25.849
Above all, the King levied from
1634 the tax Ship Money.

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:29.572
Just to explain,
Ship Money was a tax which

00:38:29.572 --> 00:38:34.715
could be levied on coastal
counties and on ports in lieu of

00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:40.389
their provision of ships for the
royal navy in time of need.

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:42.239
It was well established.
 

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:47.318
It had been used by Elizabeth
in the war against Spain without

00:38:47.318 --> 00:38:48.650
any complaint.
 

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.190
Charles, however,
took things further.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:55.215
He charged Ship Money on the
ports initially,

00:38:55.215 --> 00:38:59.606
extended it to coastal counties
in time of peace,

00:38:59.606 --> 00:39:04.639
and then in 1635 extended it to
the entire country.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:09.400
Thereafter Ship Money was
levied every year.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.280
It had become an annual
un-parliamentary tax.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.664
The legality of Ship Money was
challenged in 1637 by a number

00:39:20.664 --> 00:39:27.601
of gentlemen who refused to pay,
led by John Hampden--after whom

00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:31.262
our suburb is named--
and Ship Money was only

00:39:31.262 --> 00:39:34.931
narrowly validated in the court
judgment which resulted in the

00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:38.300
Ship Money case where the judges
found for the King,

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.159
but only by a majority of seven
to five.

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:45.826
Only narrowly did they
recognize the legality of this

00:39:45.826 --> 00:39:46.250
tax.
 

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:51.409
Five of the principal justices
thought it was illegal.

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:56.675
Well, to revisionist
historians, the 1630s can be

00:39:56.675 --> 00:40:03.369
seen as a period of relatively
successful royal government.

00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:07.001
Mark Kishlansky has remarked
that "there was no

00:40:07.001 --> 00:40:11.275
groundswell of opposition"
to Charles' government in the

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:14.327
1630s,
and indeed there was little

00:40:14.327 --> 00:40:19.369
public protest for the simple
reason that there was no longer

00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:24.411
a forum for that protest to be
expressed since parliament was

00:40:24.411 --> 00:40:25.840
not meeting.
 

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.204
But if the 1630s were a period
of apparent stability I'd

00:40:30.204 --> 00:40:34.329
suggest that it was the
stability of resignation,

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:38.800
or the stability of anxious
waiting on events,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.442
rather than active consent to
these measures by the royal

00:40:43.442 --> 00:40:44.518
government.
 

00:40:44.518 --> 00:40:48.728
Down in the counties local
rulers usually obeyed royal

00:40:48.728 --> 00:40:51.510
commands when they received
them.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:55.844
It was their duty to do so,
but they could also entertain

00:40:55.844 --> 00:40:57.780
their private thoughts.
 

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.248
They could discuss them
cautiously and anxiously with

00:41:01.248 --> 00:41:02.449
their neighbors.
 

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:05.929
They could record them
privately in their diaries.

00:41:05.929 --> 00:41:09.827
They could watch what happened
in things like the Ship Money

00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:10.289
case.
 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:15.159
In 1633, Sir Robert Harley
entered in his diary his prayers

00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:19.947
for a new parliament as well as
his prayers for Protestant

00:41:19.947 --> 00:41:25.489
success in Europe and for the
religious exiles in New England.

00:41:25.489 --> 00:41:29.659
In the county of Suffolk,
John Rous is revealed by his

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:32.570
diary to have been deeply
worried,

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.360
deeply reluctant to think badly
of the King,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.081
sometimes defending the King's
actions against more critical

00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:40.840
neighbors.
 

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.413
But by the end of the 1630s he
too had become convinced that

00:41:45.413 --> 00:41:49.367
there existed around the King
what he described as a

00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:53.786
"malignant party"
who "hate reformation and

00:41:53.786 --> 00:41:56.500
would bring in tyranny."
 

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.139
Amongst many of the political
nation,

00:41:58.139 --> 00:42:03.070
then, Charles' rule was
breeding a profound anxiety,

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:08.619
a profound alienation,
and deep suspicion regarding

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:13.059
what his ultimate intentions
might be.

00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:18.039
The extent of that alienation
would only be fully revealed

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:23.105
when parliament met again in
1640 when the King was at last

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:26.599
obliged to call another
parliament,

00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:31.820
but that he did so at all was
the consequence of his own

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.579
folly.
 

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:37.302
The folly of Charles and
Archbishop Laud in 1637 when

00:42:37.302 --> 00:42:42.934
they decided to impose upon the
Presbyterian church of Scotland

00:42:42.934 --> 00:42:48.474
both an extension of Episcopal
government and an English style

00:42:48.474 --> 00:42:50.110
prayer book.
 

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.954
It was an act of utter folly,
the product of their dogmatism,

00:42:55.954 --> 00:42:59.559
their arrogance,
their insistence upon

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:04.530
uniformity, and the blow-back
was catastrophic.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.963
When the Archbishop of St.
 

00:43:05.963 --> 00:43:09.110
Andrew's attempted to read from
the new prayer book in St.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.255
Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh,
an Edinburgh housewife threw

00:43:12.255 --> 00:43:13.469
her stool at him.
 

00:43:13.469 --> 00:43:16.619
To the Scots,
such innovations in their

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:18.952
church,
a separate church from the

00:43:18.952 --> 00:43:21.070
Church of England,
seemed to be,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:25.989
as they described them,
"popish, atheistical,

00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:27.340
and English."
 

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.369
&gt;
 

00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:32.469
Which of the three was worst I
leave to your judgment.

00:43:32.469 --> 00:43:36.498
They met together in 1638 to
form a National Covenant to

00:43:36.498 --> 00:43:41.204
resist these innovations,
and in the face of the King's

00:43:41.204 --> 00:43:46.239
refusal to back down they
rebelled and by doing so began

00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:50.360
to cause the whole house of
cards to fall.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.000
And I'll take the story up from
there next week.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000

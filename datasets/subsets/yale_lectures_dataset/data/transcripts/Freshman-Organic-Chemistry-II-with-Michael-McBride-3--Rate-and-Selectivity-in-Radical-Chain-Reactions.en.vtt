00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.000
J. MICHAL MCBRIDE: The idea is
that if you're 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.433
talking about two similar 

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:09.967
reactions, two similar reagents,
the one that's more 

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.667
reactive will be less
selective in

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.300
which product it gives. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.300
So here we have the example of
two radicals, a chlorine or 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.333
bromine atom, reacting with
propane. 

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.867
Remember, the chain reaction is
that first the halogen atom 

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:30.000
pulls off a hydrogen, generates
a radical, which 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.467
then takes on a new halogen. 

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.633
So wherever that first hydrogen
gets pulled off, 

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:38.667
that's where the halogen will
end up in the product. 

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.833
But in the case of propane there
are two different 

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.367
hydrogens that you can take
off-- the one in the middle or 

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.233
the one at the end. 

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.867
And it's easier to take off the
one in the middle because 

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:52.267
the radical is more stable, the
secondary radical, the 

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:55.233
internal one rather than the
primary radical. 

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.667
We talked about that last time--
the extent to which 

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:58.367
that's true. 

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:02.067
But whether it's differences in
the starting material or 

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:05.400
differences in the product,
however you slice it, it's 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.667
easier to take off the hydrogen
from the secondary 

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.933
position than the primary
position. 

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.700
So the overall heat of the
reaction as you see here is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.300
better by 2.5 kilocalories for
generating the secondary 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.800
radical, as opposed to 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.767
generating the primary radical.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.867
And that's true whether chlorine
is doing the 

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:28.900
abstracting or bromine is doing
the abstracting. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.567
The same difference overall in
the products. 

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:37.600
But the actual change in energy
is much more positive 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.833
in the case of bromine. 

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.000
It's harder to do than it is in
chlorine. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.833
So chlorine is more reactive and
bromine is less reactive. 

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:56.300
But notice that the difference
in the activation energies is 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.700
more dramatic in the case of
bromine than it is in the case 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.967
of chlorine. 

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.800
The earlier the transition
comes, the less difference 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200
there's going to be. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
So chlorine, the more reactive
reagent, is less selective. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.167
And bromine, the less reactive
agent, is more selective. 

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.867
So this is called the
reactivity-selectivity 

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:24.267
principle, and it only can apply
to the extent that the 

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:28.467
transition states are mirroring
what the products do 

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.700
and that the two reactions are
very, very similar to one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.667
another, and there's not
something else that makes the 

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:37.300
reaction transition state come
much earlier or much later 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.567
with a much different structure.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:44.867
So in the case of chlorine, the
relative rate of forming 

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.867
secondary versus primary is a
factor of 4. 

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.167
But in the case of bromine it's
almost 10 times as large, 

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:55.767
the selectivity. It's a factor
of 35. 

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.867
That means in the first case,
the difference in energies of 

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:04.067
activation, the delta delta G
double-dagger-- 

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:07.333
delta G double-dagger is the
activation energy. 

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:11.200
But the difference in the
activation energy is 0.8 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.433
kilocalories per mole, about 1.

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:17.233
Whereas with the later
transition state the 

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:18.867
difference is very much bigger,
4.5. 

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:28.233
So typically more reactive means
less selective. 

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.067
So if you were a chemist who
wanted to prepare a certain 

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:34.333
product that required
selectivity, you might choose 

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.333
to use a less reactive reagent
rather than a more reactive 

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.333
one, so you'd get a higher yield
of the material you wanted, 

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.867
even if it was a little more
difficult to do, if it took a 

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:46.900
little longer. 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.400
Now let's look at this a little
more carefully, the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.867
fact that the difference in
energies of activation in the 

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:56.400
case of bromine taking off a
primary or a secondary 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.133
hydrogen, the difference in
activation is 4.5 

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:03.533
kilocalories per mole. 

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:05.700
We just went through why it was
reasonable that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.000
it should be large. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.133
But should it be that large? 

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.500
Notice that the difference when
you get all the way to 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.733
products is 2.5 kilocalories per
mole. 

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:20.967
Now we had the idea that
relative to a standard, say 

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:27.067
methane, the energies for taking
off a secondary 

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.467
hydrogen should be-- 

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:33.100
either the starting material is
less stable or the product 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.167
is more stable, compared to our
standard 

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:37.767
methane in this case. 

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:41.767
But at any rate, there's an
increase in stability relative 

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:45.167
to the normal case, up at the
top here. 

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:48.133
Relative to that, there's an
increase in stability as you 

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.733
go from starting material to
this free-radical 

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:52.567
intermediate. 

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:54.633
Now there's a question where the
transition 

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.167
state comes on that. 

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:59.567
If it's early you don't see much
of 

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.167
that increased stability. 

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:06.400
If it comes late you see more of
that stability difference. 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.933
However, you see what's nuts
here? 

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:14.233
What we see is this. 

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.867
There's more difference at the
transition state than there 

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.833
even is when you get all the way
to product. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.167
So how can the transition states
be more different in 

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:28.867
energy than the products are? 

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:32.467
This might not be a straight
line, but at least you'd 

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:34.133
expect it to be monotonic-- 

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.100
not go down and then up again. 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.767
There's something we're missing
here. 

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.967
The trouble we're having is
understanding the energy of 

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:48.133
transition states. 

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.967
Regular molecules we're more or
less comfortable with, but 

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:54.667
transition states are tougher. 

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.667
So one way to look at transition
states is molecular 

00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:59.233
orbital theory. 

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.900
Another one is with resonance
theory. 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.700
And the problem is that you
don't know which of the R or 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.867
Br the hydrogen is bonded to
when it's being transferred. 

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.567
You could write one resonance
structure in which it's bonded 

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:15.033
to R and bromine is an atom. 

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:17.867
Or you could write another
resonance structure where it's 

00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:22.667
bonded to Br and R is the free
radical. 

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:26.033
And it's exactly poised between
those two at the 

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.800
transition state-- that's the
definition of the transition 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.167
state that you're about halfway
there. 

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:36.600
But what's special about the
transition state if there 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.333
could be another resonance
structure. 

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:43.100
A third resonance structure,
which has Br minus, because 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.000
bromine, after all, is
electronegative. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.300
And R could be plus. 

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:56.967
So at the transition state here
we could have cation 

00:06:56.967 --> 00:07:00.067
character to the R, so that will
be helpful at the 

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:01.400
transition state. 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.067
A third resonance structure here
stabilizing things in 

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:08.033
resonance theory. 

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:14.400
But the R cation is irrelevant
when it's R-H over here, or 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.067
when it's an R radical. 

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:18.033
Once the radical gets away it
only has a 

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:20.133
certain number of electrons. 

00:07:20.133 --> 00:07:22.233
It's not R plus anymore. 

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.867
So as we'll see next week,
substituting a methyl for 

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:32.467
hydrogen that is going from a
primary to a secondary cation 

00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:35.400
stabilizes the cation a lot. 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.733
So this is unusually stable. 

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:42.800
But this is important, this
resonance structure, only at 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.133
the transition state-- 

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:47.500
not in the starting material and
not in the product. 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.367
So we make a mistake in this
case if we assume that the 

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.467
character of the transition
state is intermediate between 

00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:57.600
starting material and product
for this one-step reaction. 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.567
There are actually special
factors that apply only in the 

00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:02.467
transition state. 

00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:05.567
And we'll see when we talk about
pericyclic reactions 

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:07.733
that this is very important. 

00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:11.033
So sometimes factors involved in
stabilizing transition 

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:14.033
states could be different from
those involved in stabilizing 

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:16.967
either the starting materials or
the products. 

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:20.000
And in these cases we can't
easily rationalize the 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.300
activation energy changes on the
basis of the overall 

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.000
exothermicity or endothermicity
of the reaction 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.867
step, because there's something
special going on at 

00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:31.267
the transition state. 

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:34.067
You hope that's not always the
case. 

00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:38.767
Most cases you could do thinking
that more exothermic 

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.800
reactions will be faster. 

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.333
But you have to be careful in
some cases. 

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:46.233
And as I said, we'll see
dramatic examples where the 

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:49.600
transition state has something
special about it when we get 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.000
to discussing pericyclic
reactions in the third quarter 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.567
of the course. 

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:58.433
Now here are two problems for
Wednesday that have to do with 

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:02.400
free-radical substitution, and
you can work in 

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.833
groups if you wish. 

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:06.500
Remember, we won't have a class
on Monday, and there 

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.367
won't be discussion section in
the evening on Monday either. 

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:12.767
So here's problem one. 

00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:14.833
Suppose, as we've just been
talking about, 

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:18.900
monochlorination of propane
gives n-propyl chloride and 

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.867
isopropyl chloride in ratio
43:57. 

00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:25.900
Note I say monochlorination,
because, of course, these 

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.567
products can also have a
hydrogen abstracted and you 

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.633
can get dichlorination,
trichlorination and so on. 

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.700
So if you want to get these
ratios accurately, you do just 

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.667
a little bit of reaction and see
the first products before 

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:39.733
you get subsequent substitutions

00:09:39.733 --> 00:09:41.533
on the initial products. 

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:43.267
You do just a little conversion
and see 

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:44.533
what the ratio is. 

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:49.367
And in the case of propane it's
43:57, primary and 

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:51.667
secondary with the hydrogen
places. 

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:55.567
So if that, and if
monochlorination of 

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:58.900
2-methylpropane gives-- 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.233
it's called isobutane also--
gives t-butyl chloride and 

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:07.700
1-chloro-2-methylpropane, 36%
and 64% yields. 

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.867
Notice this is a little test
also on knowing what the 

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:15.600
structures are of compounds that
have these names. 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.633
Then predict the products for
monochlorination of 

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:19.867
2-methylbutane. 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.133
So you're going to get relative
reactivity of primary 

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:28.367
and secondary from one, relative
reactivity of primary 

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:32.933
and tertiary from another, and
then you'll use the relative 

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:37.500
reactivity of secondary and
tertiary to solve the problem. 

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.067
Now you'll find in the textbooks
that you have-- 

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:44.633
every textbook I'm confident has
this kind of problem in it 

00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:48.233
about selectivity in free-
radical chlorination. 

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:50.333
It probably has the same
examples. 

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:53.100
So consult your textbook on
free-radical halogenation to 

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.800
be sure you're taking the
statistics of hydrogen numbers 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.267
properly into account. 

00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:02.067
That's the first problem. 

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:05.033
The second problem is solve the
puzzle that's going to be 

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:08.400
coming up on slide 18, so hold
on and we'll get to that one. 

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.300
So we've been talking about
free- radical substitution-- 

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.700
take off a hydrogen and
substitute it with a halogen. 

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.033
But there's another free-radical
chain reaction that 

00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:24.167
involves halogens, and that's
addition to alkenes. 

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:31.667
So the starting materials are an
alkene and hydrogen halide. 

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:34.633
And somehow you get a radical to
start it off, 

00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:37.000
say a halogen radical. 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.200
And instead of pulling off a
hydrogen it adds 

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.333
to the double bond. 

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:46.200
So it gives that intermediate
carbon radical. 

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.767
And then that one is the one
that does an abstraction of 

00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:55.600
hydrogen, this time from H-X. So
you get a product where X 

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.833
and H have added to the
carbon-carbon double bond. 

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:03.633
So free-radical addition to the
alkenes, and 

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:04.900
it's a chain reaction. 

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.167
Once you get a radical it can go
round and round without 

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:10.367
getting rid of radicals. 

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:18.467
Let's look at the energetics
that are involved in this. 

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:22.167
A curious thing about this
reaction is it doesn't work 

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:25.133
with all X-H's. 

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:28.333
Now let's see why. 

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:31.467
So we'll analyze the energies of
the bonds-- we're using 

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.200
here just average bond energies.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.833
So in the starting material we
have a carbon-carbon double 

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:39.133
bond that's worth 146. 

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:45.367
And we have the X radical, and
also there's X-H in the 

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:46.167
starting material. 

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:49.700
And in the product we've added
the X-H to the alkene making a 

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.900
new carbon-carbon bond that's
worth 83 kilocalories per 

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.233
mole, and a carbon-hydrogen bond
that's worth 99. 

00:12:57.233 --> 00:13:02.167
And we've converted X-H to X
radical. 

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:06.800
So if we look at the average
bond energies involving 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.567
fluorine, for R-X, the product,
we have 116 that's 

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.267
going to go in here. 

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:15.800
And a starting material we're
going to have H-X, 

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.700
hydrogen-fluoride, 135 that's
going to go there. 

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.200
So we're going to add these
together, these bond energies. 

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:29.433
Here it's 146 for the double
bond, and 135 for the X-H in 

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:31.067
the case of fluorine. 

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:37.033
And in the product, it's going
to be 83 and 99 and 116 for 

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:38.833
the carbon-fluorine bond. 

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:42.200
So we add them together and we
find out this is favorable by 

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:49.700
17 kilocalories per mole to do
the overall transformation. 

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.767
So it's going to be exothermic
in the case of HF. 

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.967
How about in the case of the
other halogen atoms? 

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:01.933
We could use the corresponding
values for their bonds, and we 

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:04.633
get that they're almost exactly
the same. 

00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:09.300
So all these additions would be
the same exothermicity. 

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.167
So you might think they'd all go
at about the same rate. 

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.400
But they don't at all. 

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.900
Only HBr works. 

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.167
Why? 

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:28.000
Overall, the thermodynamics is
fine for the transformation. 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.100
But the question is mechanism
and activation energies. 

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.200
And remember there are two steps
in this reaction. 

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.867
First the X adds to the alkene,
then the new carbon 

00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:41.833
radical abstracts a hydrogen. 

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:44.667
So we have to look at the
individual steps to get what 

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:47.567
the activation energies are. 

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:53.500
So we first have to go to this
intermediate, which has a 

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.800
single bond worth 83
kilocalories per mole, instead 

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.700
of the double bond worth 146. 

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.833
So that's going to be fabulously
exothermic, this 

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.533
first step. 

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:11.200
So very exothermic should mean
very fast, so that's going to 

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.700
be no problem. 

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.033
That's in the case of fluorine,
the blue one. 

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:18.767
In the case of chlorine it's
still exothermic-- 

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:21.967
that should be not as fast but
easy still. 

00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:25.667
Bromine still exothermic. 

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:30.000
But iodine is endothermic. 

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.600
So that reaction is going to be
very slow. 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.833
So we can understand now why
iodine doesn't work. 

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:39.767
But why not fluorine and why not
chlorine? 

00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:41.467
STUDENT: Because the second part
isn't favored... 

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:43.100
PROFESSOR: Ah, Derek, you're
right. 

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.300
It's the second step that's hard
for them. 

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.567
Because having this intermediate
we now have to go 

00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:51.000
here by abstracting the X-H
bond. 

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200
And the X-H bond we have to
break in the case of fluorine 

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.367
is fabulously strong, 135
kilocalories per mole. 

00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:01.600
So that reaction is going to be
way endothermic and it'll 

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.967
be very slow. 

00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:07.233
So the cyclic mechanism will
cough on the second 

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:09.767
step for that one. 

00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:14.700
And in the case of chlorine the
second step is also a 

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.800
little bit endothermic so it's
not very fast. 

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.067
But in the case of bromine it's
exothermic again. 

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:29.067
In the case of iodine it would
be exothermic, but the first 

00:16:29.067 --> 00:16:33.600
step is where the machine
coughed. 

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.233
So only bromine is set up to do
both of 

00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:38.833
these relatively rapidly. 

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:42.633
Now you might say, OK, we'll do
the others, 

00:16:42.633 --> 00:16:45.400
we'll just wait longer. 

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.767
It won't be as fast because one
or the other the steps 

00:16:47.767 --> 00:16:48.633
will be slow. 

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.033
We'll just wait. 

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:53.233
But you can't do that with
free-radical reactions. 

00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:57.667
Only HBr works fast enough in
both steps, and you need both 

00:16:57.667 --> 00:17:00.333
steps to be fast. 

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:04.233
Now we're going to get to
discussing what would happen 

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:07.533
otherwise, if both steps aren't
fast, in just a minute. 

00:17:07.533 --> 00:17:11.200
But first I want to comment on
one other aspect of addition 

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.867
to the alkenes. 

00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:15.600
What's called regiospecificity.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.667
I don't particularly like that
word, but it has to do with 

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:22.800
when you add HX to a double bond
there are two regions 

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.167
they could go to-- the H could
go here and the X 

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:28.333
here or vice versa. 

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:32.233
So when we add HX we could
imagine X going to this carbon 

00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:35.967
or H going to this carbon. 

00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:39.800
And it turns out that for any
halogen that can undergo 

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.533
addition, there's a principle
called "Markovnikov 

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:49.833
orientation", after a Russian
chemist at the latter part of 

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.167
the nineteenth century. 

00:17:52.167 --> 00:17:55.667
And he discovered this in 1870,
just about the time that 

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:58.567
people knew about structures, of
course, that what you 

00:17:58.567 --> 00:18:03.000
tended to get was the more
substituted halide, that is 

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.333
the X went to the carbon between
these two that has 

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:08.967
more substituents on it. 

00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:13.133
And it's understood in terms of
initial addition of H+. 

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:16.667
This was figured out in the
1930s. 

00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:20.733
And it's because of this ionic
mechanism that we'll discuss 

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:25.300
in three weeks that Markovnikov
orientation works. 

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.567
We'll talk about that when we
come to it. 

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:31.467
But what's important is when you
do this HBr addition by 

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:35.967
the free radical mechanism, the
cyclic mechanism, you get 

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:38.333
the anti-Markovnikov product. 

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.967
It goes exactly the other way--
the bromine goes on the 

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:42.667
less substituted carbon. 

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:50.767
So this was quite a mystery for
people from 1870 on, why 

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:53.900
HBr was sometimes a bad actor. 

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.733
Sometimes it would give the
Markovnikov product, the 

00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:59.000
expected one that all the other
hydrogen 

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.700
halides would give. 

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.933
But sometimes it gave the other.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.567
It tended not to give mixtures,
it would give all 

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:07.333
one or all the other. 

00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:12.900
But in the 1930s, 1933, it was
found out that this happened 

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.367
when the samples contained
little bits of peroxide. 

00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:19.367
Now let's see why that is. 

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:23.567
It's because it's an initiator
of radical chains. 

00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:26.400
Remember you needed some way to
have a radical to begin 

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.867
this whole process. 

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:34.100
So if you have R-O-O-R, a
peroxide, and HBr and the 

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.600
alkene, the first thing that
happens in this mechanism is 

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.733
that you break the O-O bond to
get two R-O radicals. 

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:44.900
Now you have the radical that
could do a hydrogen 

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.567
abstraction. 

00:19:46.567 --> 00:19:49.867
So it abstracts hydrogen from
HBr, and now 

00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:51.100
you're into the machine-- 

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.167
you have X dot that could add to
the alkene and get one or 

00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:58.667
the other of those two radicals.

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:02.233
Now if you've got the radical on
the left you get 

00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:05.533
Markovnikov orientation, because
H would come here the 

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:09.100
next time it abstracts H from
HBr. 

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.400
But, in fact, this is the one
you get because the secondary 

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.900
radical is more stable. 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.967
So when you're getting radicals
you get that one 

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:23.567
rather than the primary radical.

00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:30.300
So that explains then the
regiospecificity of the 

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.567
special addition of HBr, but
only if you 

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.433
can get free radicals. 

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:39.700
Now why can't you just do it
waiting longer? 

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.600
This has to do with the rate law
when you 

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.067
have a catalytic cycle. 

00:20:45.067 --> 00:20:47.533
So we're going to discuss it in
this case, but it's 

00:20:47.533 --> 00:20:50.300
important in all sorts of cases
where there's catalysis 

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.067
in inorganic chemistry, in
biochemistry. 

00:20:53.067 --> 00:20:56.133
When there's catalysis and you
have these cycles, the rate 

00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:58.333
laws you get are a little bit
different from 

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:00.667
what you might expect. 

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:03.100
So there are two steps in this
reaction. 

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.133
The first step has a certain
rate constant and, of course, 

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:08.700
the rate then multiplies that
rate constant by 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.633
concentrations to get a rate. 

00:21:10.633 --> 00:21:15.467
And the two reagents are R-H and
X dot. 

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:17.900
Then there's the second step
which has some other rate 

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:23.533
constant, K2, and its starting
materials are, in this case, 

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.600
that dihalogen and R dot. 

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.867
Now a couple of years ago when
we were having a visiting 

00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:36.367
lecture by Barry Sharpless who
won the Nobel Prize in 

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:37.767
catalysis-- 

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:40.333
you can look at his lecture if
you want to-- but one thing he 

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.700
said caught my imagination. 

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.433
He said, "This is a real
democracy, catalysis". 

00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:49.667
What did he mean by it being a
democracy? 

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:55.000
It's because when this thing is
going around, these two 

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.867
rates have to be equal. 

00:21:56.867 --> 00:22:01.833
Whatever K1 times those is has
to equal K2 times those. 

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:07.233
And the concentration of the
free radicals will adjust the 

00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:10.767
ratio of the two to make those
two equal. 

00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:14.000
What would happen if the first
one were really fast and the 

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.800
second one were slow? 

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.300
Then you would convert X dot to
R dot. 

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.567
So you'd have a big R dot, which
would favor the second 

00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:27.200
one, and the small X dot on the
first one, and soon they'd 

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.967
become equal and then the thing
can go around at 

00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:33.433
whatever rate they allow. 

00:22:33.433 --> 00:22:35.633
But both steps are involved. 

00:22:35.633 --> 00:22:37.867
These two things become equal. 

00:22:37.867 --> 00:22:39.567
So that's what he meant by a
democracy 

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.233
that they were equal. 

00:22:41.233 --> 00:22:44.933
Now you can see an example of
that if you look down on the 

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:48.700
Garden State Parkway here. 

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:55.767
Notice that for the cars going
north there's a lot of 

00:22:55.767 --> 00:22:58.333
difference between these lanes
of traffic and 

00:22:58.333 --> 00:22:59.567
these lanes of traffic. 

00:22:59.567 --> 00:23:01.033
And the same is true here. 

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:04.967
There's a big difference between
those two. 

00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:08.833
And the reason is that this is
cash and this is E-ZPass. 

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.667
So if we look just at the cash
lanes, you notice that there's 

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:18.833
a low rate constant here. 

00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:21.367
You've got lots of starting
material building up its 

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:25.467
concentration trying to get
through paying. 

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:29.867
But once they get through they
can accelerate and go on fine. 

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:33.000
So here you have a high rate
constant, here you have a low 

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.267
rate constant. 

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:38.933
But the number of cars per
minute, the fluxes here and 

00:23:38.933 --> 00:23:41.200
here, are the same. 

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.467
The cars that come here also end
up here. 

00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:47.600
So the point is that here you
have high concentration, here 

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.033
you have low concentration. 

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:51.900
But the rates are the same. 

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.133
The small rate constant paying
cash times the high 

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:58.933
concentration is the same as the
big rate constant once you 

00:23:58.933 --> 00:24:01.667
speed it up times the low
concentration. 

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:05.233
So it's the same as you go
around in the cycle. 

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:07.600
The rates of the two have to be
the same, even though the 

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.967
rate constants are different. 

00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:12.533
So the concentrations adjust. 

00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:14.767
And you'll notice, as Sharpless
said in that 

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:18.900
lecture, if there's a slow step,
like this one, then 

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.100
there's 99.9% of the titanium is
what he was calling about-- 

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.333
remember we talked about that
last time. 

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:26.767
That's what he was talking
about. 

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:29.867
They're stuck before this big
mountain that goes way up like 

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:31.300
Mount Everest, he said. 

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.300
He's a colorful speaker. 

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.767
If you get that barrier down
then the rate goes way up. 

00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.567
And if you get them all at the
same height then 

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:41.333
you're really rolling. 

00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:48.867
So notice that's what happens in
the E-ZPass lane, that they 

00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:52.133
go at the same rate because
you've gotten that first big 

00:24:52.133 --> 00:24:58.600
rate constant up, the barrier
down, for that first step. 

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.933
Now let's apply that principle
back to this catalytic cycle. 

00:25:02.933 --> 00:25:06.800
So we had from the previous
slide that these two had to be 

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.433
equal when the machine is
running. 

00:25:10.433 --> 00:25:16.000
Now suppose K1 is small and K2
is large. 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.400
So now how does the rate, the
amount of material you produce 

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.767
per minute, depend on the
concentration of R-H? 

00:25:27.267 --> 00:25:28.867
Well, we can look here. 

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.800
We could rearrange this to say
that the ratio of X dot to R 

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:42.000
dot is K2 times X2 over K1 times
R-H. That we get by just 

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.567
dividing through. 

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:46.433
So we know the ratio of these
two. 

00:25:46.433 --> 00:25:50.267
But the total of the two,
there's a certain amount of 

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:51.967
radical there. 

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:55.500
As you go around the cycle it
could be either in the form of 

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.367
X dot or in the form of R dot. 

00:25:57.367 --> 00:26:02.933
So the ratio can change, but the
total amount is limited. 

00:26:02.933 --> 00:26:07.100
So let us suppose that X dot is
dominant. 

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.833
Suppose there's 98:2, the ratio
of X dot to R dot. 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.533
Now let's double the amount of
R-H. We're leaving the 

00:26:19.533 --> 00:26:23.600
radicals the same but we're
doubling the amount of R-H. So 

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.367
we're going to double this,
double this, leave that the 

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:31.033
same, these are fixed constants,
but 

00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:32.267
we're doubling this. 

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:35.600
So what's going to happen? 

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.267
The ratio's going to change. 

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:39.733
That's what we've just been
talking about. 

00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:44.733
So instead of 98:2, we have to
get a ratio that's 

00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:47.533
only half that big. 

00:26:47.533 --> 00:26:49.933
We have 100 radicals to deal
with. 

00:26:49.933 --> 00:26:55.100
They're in the form of 98 X dot
and 2 R dot. 

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.300
If we double R-H, up here-- 

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.500
we're interested in what that
exponent is-- we double R-H, 

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.667
we're going to halve that ratio.

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.033
How will we do it? 

00:27:07.033 --> 00:27:10.233
We still have 100 radicals. 

00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:15.467
But instead of 98:2, if we
assume that the sum is 

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:19.467
constant, we're going to have
96:4. 

00:27:19.467 --> 00:27:22.100
Everybody see that? 

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.667
This ratio is half that ratio,
very close. 

00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:35.100
But how much did that change the
concentration of X dot? 

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.500
Notice it doubled the
concentration of R dot. 

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.567
But it hardly changed the
concentration of X dot at all 

00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:47.533
in relative terms. it just went
to 96 from 98. 

00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:51.867
So X dot is still the same
concentration. 

00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:54.733
So the rate at which you go
through here, which is the 

00:27:54.733 --> 00:27:56.967
same as the rate you go through
here, is 

00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:59.067
now the same here. 

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:02.400
This one has been doubled, and
this one is practically the 

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.867
same-- it's 96 instead of 98. 

00:28:05.867 --> 00:28:07.967
So what happened to the rate
approximately? Matt?" 

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.433
STUDENT: Doubled? 

00:28:11.433 --> 00:28:12.967
PROFESSOR: The rate doubled. 

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:16.433
So who's surprised that when you
double the starting 

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:18.433
material here you double the
rate? 

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:23.667
That is that the question mark
there is about 2. 

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.733
I see no hands. 

00:28:25.733 --> 00:28:27.800
What do you expect? 

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:36.600
So this rate grows by that now,
1.96 fold, practically 2. 

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:43.100
So it's first order in R-H. Did
I say 2 before? 

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.967
It's first order in R-H, no
one's surprised. 

00:28:48.267 --> 00:28:50.133
Of course, the rate is also
proportional to K1. 

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.400
Now how about if we change the
concentration of X2? 

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.167
What's its exponent? 

00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.833
So let's do the same analysis. 

00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:06.167
Now we're going to double X2. 

00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:13.733
So we'll double X2 and now we're
going to have to double 

00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:15.833
the ratio of X dot to R dot. 

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.433
Remember we're starting from 98
to 2. 

00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:23.400
What do we do in order to double
that ratio? 

00:29:29.233 --> 00:29:32.633
We have to go 99 to 1. 

00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:33.900
Everybody see that? 

00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.433
That's now going to make a
difference because if we look 

00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:41.600
at this rate, which is the same
as that rate, it's the 

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.400
same K2, the same-- 

00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:51.200
pardon me, we doubled X2. 

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.267
But R dot is now only half as
big as it was before. 

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:03.200
So we doubled X2, but we halved
R dot. 

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.033
So we didn't accelerate it at
all. 

00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:12.500
So it's zero order in X2. 

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.867
So it depends on the
concentration of this starting 

00:30:14.867 --> 00:30:17.867
material, the one that goes into
the slow step, but it 

00:30:17.867 --> 00:30:20.400
doesn't depend on the
concentration of this starting 

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.233
material, the one that goes into
the fast step. 

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:28.467
So probably if I'd asked you, my
guess is if-- 

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:31.500
we should have done this as a
democracy, as Sharpless said. 

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.000
And I should have asked you
before what you think that 

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.733
exponent is and what you think
that exponent is. 

00:30:36.733 --> 00:30:39.400
My guess is you'd have said
they're both 1. 

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.633
But in fact that one's zero. 

00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:46.767
The rate is also, therefore, if
it's insensitive to X2 it's 

00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:50.533
also insensitive to K2. 

00:30:50.533 --> 00:30:53.700
So in summary, when one step of
a cycle is much slower than 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.167
the others, the rate of cycling
is pretty insensitive 

00:30:57.167 --> 00:31:00.133
to the rate constant and
concentration of the incoming 

00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:04.133
reagent for the fast step. 

00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:06.933
Because concentration of the
minor form of recycling 

00:31:06.933 --> 00:31:10.267
reagent adjust to compensate and
fractional changes in 

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:16.367
concentrations of dominant
radical are much more modest. 

00:31:16.367 --> 00:31:19.533
So the rate's obviously going to
be proportional, to the 

00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:20.867
amount of radical. 

00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:21.767
There's no surprises-- 

00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:24.700
if you were running 13 machines
it's going to be 13 

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.567
times faster than running just
one machine. 

00:31:27.567 --> 00:31:30.000
But that's the other factor that
we were going to get to a 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.867
few minutes ago. 

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:34.133
That we're going to have
initiation and termination, 

00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:37.967
and in my fancying up the slides
I forgot to animate 

00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:40.900
that properly, sorry. 

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.967
So initiation typically involves
breaking a weak bond 

00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:48.800
with light, heat or adding an
electron, or sometimes taking 

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.233
away an electron. 

00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:54.633
So heat, you can take a weak
bond, and with heat, break it 

00:31:54.633 --> 00:31:55.733
to get two radicals-- 

00:31:55.733 --> 00:31:58.467
the oxygen-oxygen bond is
unusually weak, as we're going 

00:31:58.467 --> 00:32:01.500
to be discussing not long from
now. 

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.033
Or you can use light-- we talked
about this last 

00:32:04.033 --> 00:32:05.267
semester already-- 

00:32:05.267 --> 00:32:08.367
take an electron that's in
sigma, put it in sigma-star 

00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:09.967
and the chlorines will come
apart. 

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.333
This one has an energy of 30
kilocalories per mole. 

00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:18.900
What are the energies of other
sigma bonds we've been talking 

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.200
about, more or less? 

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.200
C-C or C-H, for example, order
of magnitude. 

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.333
100, right? 

00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:31.200
3 times as strong. 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.033
So this is an unusually weak
bond, so you 

00:32:33.033 --> 00:32:34.367
can do it with heat. 

00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:38.167
And the reason it's weak is
because you have repulsion 

00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:41.267
among these unshared pairs of
electrons that you don't have 

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:42.833
in the other cases. 

00:32:42.833 --> 00:32:46.733
We'll talk about that in just a
minute as well. 

00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:51.967
Or you can put an electron into
sigma-star by a reduction 

00:32:51.967 --> 00:32:57.400
reaction and get OH minus, but
the free radical OH, which can 

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.300
do a hydrogen abstraction and
start the chain. 

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:08.967
But even if you're generating
radicals, you could lose by 

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:12.033
radicals being destroyed. 

00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:15.067
Remember we said why not just
wait longer and let this 

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:17.900
machine go around, even if it's
going slower? 

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.800
The reason is that's not all the
radicals can do, 

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.300
abstracting hydrogens or adding
to double bonds. 

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.933
If radicals find each other the
SOMO-SOMO reaction is 

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:32.300
really easy. It's all downhill
in energy. 

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:37.767
So you have to be sure they
don't find partners, and that 

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:40.700
process is called termination of
a free- 

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.333
radical chain reaction. 

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:45.600
So you have initiation that
generates the radicals that 

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.467
allow the machine to work. 

00:33:47.467 --> 00:33:50.667
Propagation, that's the cycling
of the machine. 

00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:54.500
And termination, which destroys
the machines. 

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.633
Remember the New Hampshire
license plate, it says "Live 

00:33:57.633 --> 00:34:01.900
Free or Die." If the radicals
aren't free from one another, 

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.300
bingo they're gone. 

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.567
So that's termination. 

00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:08.600
So now how about the kinetic
order in 

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.000
the amount of initiator? 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.333
You might think if you initiate
the chains twice as 

00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:18.833
fast-- if you have twice as many
machines operating-- 

00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:22.933
then the reaction should be
twice as fast. The overall 

00:34:22.933 --> 00:34:26.167
rate should be twice as fast.
But that isn't true, 

00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:27.833
as you'll see here. 

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:30.900
So the initiation, indeed,
depends on how much initiator 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.033
you have, and it has a certain
rate constant for initiation 

00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:35.867
to give those radicals. 

00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:37.600
And the rate of forming radicals
is, 

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.900
therefore, first order. 

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.433
It's proportional to the 

00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:43.233
concentration of the precursor.

00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:47.000
A termination has two radicals
coming together. 

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.533
It could be any radicals. 

00:34:48.533 --> 00:34:52.433
It could be the X dots coming
together, it could be R dots 

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:55.333
coming together, or it could be
an R dot coming together 

00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:56.267
with an X dot. 

00:34:56.267 --> 00:34:59.167
All of those reactions are a
radical plus a radical-- it 

00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:00.967
will terminate. 

00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:03.733
And the rate of destroying
radicals is, of course, second 

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:07.100
order in how many radicals there
are, because two of them 

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.467
have to come together. 

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:13.933
And at steady state, once the
thing is cranking along, the 

00:35:13.933 --> 00:35:21.233
rate of initiation, which is
this here, and the rate of 

00:35:21.233 --> 00:35:24.400
termination must be the same,
because we're in the steady 

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.967
state, we're not changing the
number of machines. 

00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:32.067
So once we get to steady state
then those two will be 

00:35:32.067 --> 00:35:35.633
proportional to one another, or
the amount of R dot is 

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:41.500
proportional to the peroxide to
the one-half power because 

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.433
of that termination. 

00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:47.733
So, in fact, if the rate of the
reaction is proportional 

00:35:47.733 --> 00:35:52.467
to how many machines you have,
to the R dot, is proportional 

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:57.067
to the square root of the amount
of initiator there, 

00:35:57.067 --> 00:36:00.533
because the destruction is
second order. 

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:03.533
So that's an interesting
additional rate law, that when 

00:36:03.533 --> 00:36:07.667
you see that half order, in this
case it means that 

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:11.267
there's a chain reaction going
on and 

00:36:11.267 --> 00:36:15.000
termination is involved. 

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.300
So the answer is one-half order.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:26.300
Now we're going to shift from
free-radical reactions toward 

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:31.067
ionic reactions by considering
free-radical reactions that 

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:34.267
involve ions. 

00:36:34.267 --> 00:36:37.867
The reason this is important, to
make this transition, is 

00:36:37.867 --> 00:36:41.667
because ionic reactions are so
different because they're 

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:46.167
dependent on solvent in ways
that radical reactions aren't. 

00:36:46.167 --> 00:36:50.267
So here's another substitution
reaction where now instead of 

00:36:50.267 --> 00:36:54.667
a halogen, instead of having
Cl-Cl here, we have a 

00:36:54.667 --> 00:36:56.800
nitrogen-chlorine bond. 

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.300
So we have nitrogen radicals
that can pull off hydrogen to 

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.400
generate an amine, the NH bond
of an amine, and give a free 

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.267
radical, just as we did before,
which then can pull 

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:10.100
chlorine off here to make R-Cl.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:14.100
So we can do a free radical
halogenation, but instead of 

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.400
using a halogen we use a
chloramine. 

00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:23.633
Now this bond is about 100
kilocalories per mole, this 

00:37:23.633 --> 00:37:27.500
one is a weak bond, about 46
kilocalories per mole. 

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.433
Again, like chlorine-chlorine
would be a weak bond. 

00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:35.067
And those product ones are
strong bonds. 

00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:40.067
So the first step is a little
bit exothermic, and 

00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:43.700
the last step is-- 

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.267
pardon me. 

00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:47.667
The first step goes from a
strong bond to a weak bond, 

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:49.967
it's endothermic. 

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.167
So that's slow. 

00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:54.267
The second one goes from a weak
bond to a strong bond, 

00:37:54.267 --> 00:37:55.533
that's exothermic. 

00:37:55.533 --> 00:37:59.467
So that one's fast. The top one
is the slow step. 

00:37:59.467 --> 00:38:02.833
But that means that this will be
the dominant species 

00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:03.633
between these two. 

00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:06.767
You'll have a lot of this so
that this rate can be equal to 

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:09.567
this rate-- not much R dot at
any given time. 

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:13.900
This is then what happens. 

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.467
We have the free radical,
which-- 

00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:24.100
pardon me, two free radicals-- 

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.033
can come together in this way
that one radical takes the 

00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:31.667
hydrogen from this isopropyl
group, the hydrogen here, from 

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:32.533
the other one. 

00:38:32.533 --> 00:38:36.300
So that's the termination of the
reaction. 

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.167
That's what's going to kill it.

00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:42.967
So that's slowing the reaction
down by destroying machines. 

00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:48.100
So if we could retard this
process then we can speed up 

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.600
the reaction if you don't have
termination anymore. 

00:38:54.367 --> 00:38:57.433
So this is termination by
hydrogen atom transfer-- 

00:38:57.433 --> 00:39:00.233
get rid of the radicals and stop
the machine. 

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:04.433
Now what happens if you add
acid? 

00:39:04.433 --> 00:39:10.433
Now you protonate the unshared
pair here in the amine. 

00:39:10.433 --> 00:39:12.667
And charge will keep-- 

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:17.000
remember, most of the radicals
are in this form. 

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.867
But the charge, if they're both
charged, 

00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:21.633
it'll keep them apart. 

00:39:21.633 --> 00:39:25.000
And if they're apart then they
don't terminate. 

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.833
So you can slow down the
termination by protonating 

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:32.100
these free radicals. 

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.133
Now let's look at these results
from 1971 on using 

00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:37.933
this reagent. 

00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:43.067
This is one step in the
reaction, the chloramine, to 

00:39:43.067 --> 00:39:48.900
substitute, to halogenate, a
long chain alcohol. 

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:54.567
So what I graphed here is what
percent of isomers you get for 

00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:57.167
putting chlorine on this carbon
or on this carbon or 

00:39:57.167 --> 00:39:59.367
this carbon or this carbon or
this carbon or this carbon or 

00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:02.133
this carbon. 

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:05.800
And you can see that you don't
get more than 20% of any of 

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:12.167
them, and you get a real dog's
breakfast mixture here of 

00:40:12.167 --> 00:40:15.167
isomers-- this is useless. 

00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:18.067
You get a very low yield of
whatever it was you wanted, 

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:22.000
and you have to do a lot of work
to purify it. 

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.700
If you do it in 50% sulfuric
acid it's pretty 

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.933
much the same story. 

00:40:30.933 --> 00:40:36.133
If you do it in 60% sulfuric
acid it's a little bit better. 

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.367
You get more of this. 

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:44.667
But if you do it in 70% sulfuric
acid you get almost 

00:40:44.667 --> 00:40:45.967
all of this material-- 

00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:49.767
chlorination specifically at
that position. 

00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:52.567
So isn't that a great mechanism?

00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:57.200
By changing the solvent, by
making it a strong acid, you 

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.167
can make it selective for this
one. 

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:04.333
See the advantage of that,
obvious in synthesis. 

00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:07.067
Why? 

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:08.767
Why when you change from-- 

00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:11.600
notice 50% and 60% didn't make
much difference. 

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.567
A little difference. 

00:41:12.567 --> 00:41:16.733
But going to 70% really zoomed
up on that one. 

00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:28.333
So why does changing the acid
concentration influence the 

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:29.567
selectivity? 

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:34.767
Notice that those amine radicals
are not 

00:41:34.767 --> 00:41:37.700
really strong bases. 

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.367
It takes a very strong acid to
get most of this stuff 

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:44.600
protonated. 

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:51.167
To add this proton on there
takes a really strong acid. 

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:53.500
When you get to 70% it's
almost-- 

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.400
pardon me. 

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.533
I said exactly the wrong thing
and I apologize. 

00:41:58.533 --> 00:42:02.400
Forget what I just said for the
last 20 seconds. 

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.033
The amine is a reasonable base.

00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:07.033
It's easily protonated. 

00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:10.767
Even in weak acid this is
protonated. 

00:42:10.767 --> 00:42:13.267
But there's another base in the
system 

00:42:13.267 --> 00:42:15.800
that's hard to protonate. 

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.067
And what's that? 

00:42:19.233 --> 00:42:19.967
Sebastian? 

00:42:19.967 --> 00:42:20.900
STUDENT: The alcohol. 

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.200
PROFESSOR: The alcohol could be
protonated. 

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.900
But you need a really strong
acid to protonate the alcohol. 

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:35.133
So here the ROH is half
protonated. 

00:42:35.133 --> 00:42:38.233
Now if this molecule is
protonated it's hard to get 

00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:40.767
the two protonated things
together, so the reaction 

00:42:40.767 --> 00:42:42.067
slows down. 

00:42:42.067 --> 00:42:46.367
The reaction still proceeds, but
it goes with the material 

00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:51.700
that's not protonated, and it's
only half protonated. 

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.733
But at 70% it's fully
protonated, 

00:42:54.733 --> 00:42:55.900
everything is like that. 

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.400
Now the reaction will slow down.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.067
So it won't be as fast. But
what? 

00:43:01.067 --> 00:43:02.333
What's the advantage? 

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.367
It's hard for the charges to get
together. 

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:13.167
So they'll stay apart to the
extent they can. 

00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:14.633
So what? Ayesha? 

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.800
STUDENT: The amine would not
react... 

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.533
PROFESSOR: It won't react here
near the 

00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:24.600
other positive charge. 

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.267
It'll react out at the end. 

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:29.567
It'll get a secondary hydrogen,
not the primary 

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:32.867
one-- we've talked about that
already. 

00:43:32.867 --> 00:43:37.300
But it gets this one, not even
this one. 

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.933
Isn't that a cute idea-- 

00:43:38.933 --> 00:43:41.800
to use the charges to make the
thing selective. 

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.333
But it only happens if you can
make both reagents be charged. 

00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:47.033
This one's easy to charge. 

00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:50.400
But this one only when you get
in very strong sulfuric acid. 

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.867
I've always admired that
experiment. 

00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:58.700
So it comes down there in order
to do its reaction. 

00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:04.533
Now what I haven't shown is
reacting there. 

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.567
And this is going to be related
to your next problem. 

00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:15.567
So if you use 30% sulfuric acid,
then you get a 

00:44:15.567 --> 00:44:17.133
completely different product. 

00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:20.200
Remember I went 50%, 60%, 70%. 

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.133
But if you use 30% sulfuric
acid, then 

00:44:24.133 --> 00:44:27.667
you get that product. 

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:32.900
This carbon becomes an ester or
an acid. 

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:38.233
So this carbon gets oxidized-- 

00:44:38.233 --> 00:44:41.200
the two H's are removed and
oxygen's put on. 

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.633
And that probably got formed
from an aldehyde. 

00:44:44.633 --> 00:44:49.433
The first thing that probably
happened was that you changed 

00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:53.033
this CH2OH to the HC=O. 

00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:59.133
And mostly that's formed not by
a radical-- 

00:44:59.133 --> 00:45:03.133
it could be formed by the
radical-chain reaction. 

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:04.667
But probably it's not. 

00:45:04.667 --> 00:45:08.867
It's probably formed by a
HOMO-LUMO reaction, an 

00:45:08.867 --> 00:45:14.667
oxidation reaction, involving
this reagent. 

00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:16.633
Remember the original reagent
we're using-- 

00:45:16.633 --> 00:45:21.267
the thing you put in is
chloramine, NCl, and at 30% 

00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:23.133
acid it's protonated. 

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:28.033
So it's probably a reaction
between this stuff and this. 

00:45:28.033 --> 00:45:31.167
It could be the free-radical
reaction, but it's probably a 

00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:35.533
HOMO-LUMO reaction that's able
to convert this to that. 

00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:38.767
And this is that puzzle that's
your other problem for a week 

00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:43.500
from today, since we're not
having class on Monday-pardon

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.767
me, next Wednesday.

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:49.267
The puzzle is to propose
mechanisms to form the 

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:54.267
aldehyde involving two steps. 

00:45:54.267 --> 00:45:59.900
A substitution, but also an
elimination reaction, 

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.933
reaction with a base. 

00:46:02.933 --> 00:46:06.267
So now that substitution
reaction could either be the 

00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:10.400
radical substitution, this
mechanism going like that. 

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.167
Or it could be a HOMO-LUMO
reaction. 

00:46:15.833 --> 00:46:18.000
So I've said you could get
together and 

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
work on this in groups. 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.600
So I think you should be able to
do both these, both the 

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.000
free-radical substitution and
the HOMO-LUMO, that together 

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.633
with elimination, removing HX,
gives rise to the aldehyde. 

00:46:31.633 --> 00:46:35.567
So see if you can figure out why
at 30% sulfuric acid you 

00:46:35.567 --> 00:46:37.133
get a completely different
product. 

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.800
I think that's enough for now. 

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.500
We'll go on to this problem next
time.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.761
Prof: Last time I
introduced you to some of Rome's

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.400
greatest buildings,
and I remind you of two of them

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.693
here: the Pantheon,
on the left-hand side of the

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:14.029
screen,
the temple to all the gods,

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.216
and then,
of course, the Colosseum,

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.280
on the right-hand side of the
screen.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.272
These are two of the greatest
masterworks of Roman

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.202
architecture,
and we will gain momentum and

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:28.040
work our way up to those in the
course of the semester,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.010
but it's not where we're going
to begin.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.970
We're not going to begin with
these masterworks;

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.590
we're going to begin at the
beginning.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.468
And the beginning goes way,
way back, in fact all the way

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:40.515
to the Iron Age,
indeed to the eighth century

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:41.070
B.C.
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.020
And we know on precisely what
day,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.802
not only the history of Rome
but the history of Roman

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:51.468
architecture began,
and that was specifically on

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:55.830
the 21^(st) of April in 753
B.C.,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.618
because it was on the 21^(st)
of April in 753 B.C.

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:05.468
that, according to legend,
Romulus founded the city of

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:06.108
Rome.
 

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:10.016
Romulus founded the city of
Rome on one of Rome's seven

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:11.968
hills, the Palatine Hill.
 

00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:15.760
And I show you here a view of
the Palatine Hill.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.349
This is taken from Google Earth.
 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.263
I urged you last time to make
sure that you have Google Earth

00:01:21.263 --> 00:01:24.980
downloaded on your computer and
to take advantage of using

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.959
Google Earth in the course of
this semester in order to really

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.809
get to know the city of Rome and
the location of the various

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:37.310
buildings that we'll be talking
about within the city fabric.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.998
So I show you one of these
views of the Palatine Hill in

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:44.049
Rome,
from Google Earth,

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.930
and you can see the
relationship of that hill to the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.050
part of Rome in which it finds
itself.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.524
You're going to be able to pick
all of these buildings out by

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:57.882
yourselves in the very near
future, but let me just do that

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.620
for you here this morning.
 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.197
You can see,
of course, the Colosseum,

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:04.150
in the upper right corner.
 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.150
You can see the Roman Forum
lying in front of it.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.787
You can see the great--that
modern street that you see right

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:14.870
behind the Forum is the Via dei
Fori Imperiali,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.889
commissioned by Mussolini,
Il Duce.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:24.433
We can also see in this view
the Capitoline Hill with the

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.680
oval piazza designed by
Michelangelo,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.330
and down here the famous Circus
Maximus,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.139
as you can see,
the great stadium,

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.840
the greatest stadium of Rome.
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.050
It wasn't the only stadium of
Rome but it was the largest,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.979
and you can see its hairpin
shape right down here.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.535
The hill in question right now
is the Palatine Hill,

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:50.370
and this is the Palatine Hill,
all of this area here.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.772
And as you look down on it,
as you gaze down on it,

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:57.039
you will see the remains of a
colossal structure,

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.240
which is actually a late
first-century A.D.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.069
palace that was designed under
the direction of the emperor of

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.978
Rome at that particular time,
a very colorful character that

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:11.270
we'll talk about in some detail
later in the term,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.188
by the name of Domitian.
 

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:16.270
This is Domitian's Palace on
the Palatine Hill.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.758
But that discussion of that
palace lies in the future.

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:23.937
What I want to say today is
miraculously the remains of

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:27.110
Romulus' village on the Palatine
Hill,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.438
founded in the eighth century
B.C.,

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:33.675
actually lie beneath the
remains of the Palace of

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:38.000
Domitian in Rome,
and it's to Romulus' huts on

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.389
the Palatine Hill that I want to
turn to today.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.372
Believe it or not,
remains of those huts from the

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:47.050
Iron Age are still there.
 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.830
Now they don't look like much.
 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.946
I'm showing you what remains of
Romulus' huts right there,

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.117
and you're probably having a
hard time figuring out exactly

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:56.538
what we're looking at.
 

00:03:56.538 --> 00:04:00.141
But what we're looking at--the
architects that were working for

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:03.539
the designers,
that were working for Romulus,

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.562
were very clever indeed,
and they realized that the best

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:11.364
way to create a foundation or a
pavement for their huts was to

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:14.169
use the natural rock of the
Palatine Hill.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.040
And that's exactly what they
did.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.209
What you're looking at here is
the tufa, t-u-f-a,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.180
the natural tufa rock of the
Palatine Hill.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.730
And what they did was they
created a rectangular plan.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.560
They gave it rounded corners
and they cut the stone back

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.113
about twenty inches down,
to create that rectangular

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:38.041
shape;
they rounded the corners,

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.790
and then they put holes in the
tufa rock.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.382
The holes were to support
wooden poles that served to

00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:51.684
support the superstructure of
the hut and also to support the

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:53.540
walls of the hut.
 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.851
So the pavement of the tufa
rock of the Palatine is the

00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:02.774
floor of the hut,
and then these holes support

00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:06.889
the wooden poles that supported,
in turn, the superstructure.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.939
I now show you a restored view,
on the left.

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.728
And you should all have your
Monument Lists and should be

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.120
able to follow along with the
major monuments.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.120
You won't see every image that
I'm going to be showing here,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.564
but you'll see a selection
there of the ones that you'll

00:05:21.564 --> 00:05:25.259
need to learn and be able to
talk about for the midterm,

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.629
the two midterm exams in this
course.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.307
But you'll see there this
restored view of one of these

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:36.166
Palatine huts,
as well as a view of the model

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:41.180
that one can actually see in the
archaeological museum that's on

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.329
the Palatine Hill today.
 

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:45.519
You can see,
as you look at this restored

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.983
view on the left,
you can see that rectangular

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:51.468
plan that we talked about here;
you can see the rounded

00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:55.360
corners, and you can see the
wooden poles that were placed

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.591
into those holes to support the
walls and the superstructure of

00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:00.819
the building.
 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.009
You can see over here the same,
the wooden poles.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.858
This gives you a better sense
of what they looked like in

00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:10.810
actuality, the wooden poles and
also the superstructure.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.100
We also know what the walls
were made out of.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.565
They were made out of
something--and I put some of the

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:20.574
keywords that might be
unfamiliar to you on the

00:06:20.574 --> 00:06:24.144
Monument List as well--
they were made out of wattle

00:06:24.144 --> 00:06:24.790
and daub.
 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.689
Well what is wattle and daub?
 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.357
Wattle and daub is twigs and
rods that are covered and

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.500
plastered with clay;
twigs and rods covered and

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.810
plastered with clay.
 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.625
That served as the walls of the
structure, and then the sloping

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:42.810
roof, as you see it here,
was thatched.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.954
Now it's very hard--there are
no huts that look like this in

00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:49.257
Rome still today that I can show
you to give you a better sense

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:52.029
of what these would've looked
like in antiquity.

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.523
But I'm sure you,
like I, have seen huts like

00:06:54.523 --> 00:06:56.790
this on your travels around the
world.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.180
And one example I can show
you--and would that we were all

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.550
down there right now.
 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.649
This is a view of a small
village in the Maya Riviera,

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:08.117
near Cancun,
where one sees,

00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:13.420
if you take the bus or a car
from Maya to Chichen Itza,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.300
which I hope some of you have
had a chance to do.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.069
If you haven't,
it's a great trip.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:21.226
And you can see all along the
road huts that look very much

00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:23.879
like the huts of Romulus'
village,

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.839
made out of wood and then with
thatched roofs,

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.170
as you can see here.
 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.391
So this is the best I can do in
terms of conjuring up for you

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:33.730
Romulus' village.
 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.088
We also have information with
regard to what these huts looked

00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:40.279
like in ancient Roman times or--
not in ancient Roman,

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.509
in the Iron Age,
as I mentioned before.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:47.557
We have not only the pavement
stone that's still preserved,

00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:50.170
but we also have these urns.
 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.185
We call them hut urns,
hut urns, because they're urns

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:54.519
in the shape of huts.
 

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.199
And these hut urns were used
for cremation,

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.564
in the eighth century
B.C.--these date also to the

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.899
Iron Age--
and the cremated remains of the

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:09.028
individual were placed inside
the door of the hut.

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:12.283
And if you look at this hut
urn, you'll see that it looks

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:15.653
very similar to the huts of
Romulus that we've already been

00:08:15.653 --> 00:08:16.699
talking about.
 

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:20.759
It is either sort of square or
rectangular in shape.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:23.872
It has rounded corners,
as you can see here,

00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:26.839
and the roof of the hut urn is
sloping.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:31.625
So we do believe we use this,
along with the surviving

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:37.131
pavement, to restore what these
huts of Romulus looked like in

00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:39.570
the eighth century B.C.
 

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.924
Let me also note--it's
interesting just to see the

00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:47.102
status of men and women in any
given civilization at any given

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:47.720
time.
 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.200
There are essentially two kinds
of hut urns from the eighth

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.038
century B.C.
 

00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:55.888
Excuse me, there are two kinds
of urns in the eighth century

00:08:55.888 --> 00:08:56.279
B.C.
 

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:59.596
One of them is hut urns and the
other is helmet urns,

00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:01.890
and you can guess,
as well as anyone,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.058
as to who was buried in which.
 

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:07.181
The men were buried in the
helmet urns and the women's

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:09.418
remains were placed in the hut
urns.

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:12.750
So men's domain was considered
the battlefield;

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.389
women's domain was considered
the house.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.023
But the houses are actually
more important in terms of

00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:24.273
giving us a sense again of what
Romulus' village looked like in

00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:25.850
the eighth century.
 

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.600
And if you take one of those
huts and you combine it with

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.895
another set of huts,
you can get a sense of what the

00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:35.671
village of Romulus would have
looked like in the eighth

00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:36.720
century B.C.
 

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.178
This is a model that is on view
in the archaeological museum,

00:09:41.178 --> 00:09:45.153
on the Palatine Hill today,
and it gives you a very good

00:09:45.153 --> 00:09:49.200
sense of the village of Romulus
in the eighth century.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.071
And of course it was from this
village that the great city of

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:55.726
Rome grew,
and of course there's a quite

00:09:55.726 --> 00:09:59.611
significant difference between
Rome as it is now and Rome as it

00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:01.679
was in the eighth century B.C.
 

00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:10.840
I'm going to skip a couple of
centuries and take us from the

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.460
eighth century B.C.
 

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.315
to the sixth century B.C.,
and talk about what was the

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:22.629
greatest architectural project
in the sixth century B.C.

00:10:22.629 --> 00:10:26.311
Just a few words about what was
going on in the sixth century

00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:26.678
B.C.
 

00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:29.639
Those who were ascendant in the
sixth century B.C.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.418
were essentially the Etruscans.
 

00:10:31.418 --> 00:10:35.620
The Etruscans lived in what is
known as Etruria.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.803
They were a quite advanced
civilization prior to the Roman

00:10:39.803 --> 00:10:43.695
period, lived in Etruria,
which is essentially Tuscany

00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:44.428
today.
 

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:47.788
Etruscan, Tuscany -- Tuscany
today.

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:51.672
So the area around Florence and
so on and so forth is where many

00:10:51.672 --> 00:10:53.460
of these individuals lived.
 

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.965
They became a quite powerful
civilization and they were able

00:10:57.965 --> 00:11:02.470
to use that power to gain
ascendancy also in Rome itself.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.192
And there's a period in which
there was a succession of

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:10.690
Etruscan kings who were leading
Rome,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.014
and these Etruscan kings
eventually kicked out by the

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:14.590
Romans.
 

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.826
But at this time,
in the sixth century,

00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:18.710
they were extremely important.
 

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:24.542
And it was under Etruscan
supervision and patronage that a

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:30.578
major temple began to be put up
in Rome in the sixth century

00:11:30.578 --> 00:11:34.370
B.C.;
precisely in 509.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.041
It was dedicated in the year
509 B.C., as you can see from

00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:40.678
the Monument List.
 

00:11:40.678 --> 00:11:45.957
The temple in question was the
Temple of Jupiter Optimus

00:11:45.957 --> 00:11:48.070
Maximus Capitolinus.
 

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.480
Now that is a mouthful,
and I don't want you to have to

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.019
necessarily remember all of
that: Jupiter Optimus Maximus

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.029
Capitolinus.
 

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:01.080
So we will call this temple,
for all intents and purposes,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.042
the Temple of Jupiter OMC,
Jupiter OMC -- Optimus Maximus

00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:07.460
Capitolinus.
 

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.548
The Temple of Jupiter OMC was
dedicated,

00:12:11.548 --> 00:12:16.385
again, in the year 509 B.C.,
and it was dedicated to

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:19.676
Jupiter,
but also to his female

00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:22.740
companions, Juno and Minerva.
 

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.240
And when we think of those
three, or when those three are

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.578
joined together,
Jupiter, Juno and Minerva,

00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:32.970
they are known as the
Capitoline Triad,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.899
because their main temple was
on the Capitoline Hill in Rome.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:40.764
And we will see the Capitoline
Triad, not only honored in this

00:12:40.764 --> 00:12:42.730
temple, but in other temples.
 

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.427
I showed you one on Tuesday in
Pompeii, for example,

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:50.486
the so-called Capitolium in
Pompeii that honored Jupiter,

00:12:50.486 --> 00:12:52.009
Juno and Minerva.
 

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:54.866
You'll see that when a temple
honors the three of them,

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:57.884
it has implications for the
architecture of that building,

00:12:57.884 --> 00:12:59.788
for the design of that
building.

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:01.980
We'll talk about that right
now, in a few minutes.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.840
But I want you to be aware of
what the Capitoline Triad is.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.110
So it's all three of them,
honored together;

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.607
although Jupiter is always
considered supreme whenever

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:14.899
those three get together.
 

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:18.155
So we have a temple here that
we have to think of in large

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:21.438
part as an Etruscan temple,
put up during the time of the

00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:23.817
Etruscan kings,
dedicated in 509,

00:13:23.817 --> 00:13:28.964
but one that is beginning to
have the impact of Rome and will

00:13:28.964 --> 00:13:34.538
itself have a very strong impact
on Roman temple architecture.

00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:37.450
And we're going to focus quite
heavily today on Roman temple

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.181
architecture,
and then of course return to it

00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.000
sporadically in the course of
the semester,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.570
as we move through and look at
other temples,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.307
like the Pantheon and like
others that were put up in the

00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:50.509
Roman provinces.
 

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:55.089
The Temple of Jupiter OMC was
built on the Capitoline Hill in

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:58.600
Rome, so one of the other major
seven hills.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.758
So while the hill of the
Palatine was basically the

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.788
residential section of Rome at
this juncture,

00:14:04.788 --> 00:14:08.833
the Capitoline Hill became its
religious center where its main

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:10.158
temple was placed.
 

00:14:10.158 --> 00:14:14.705
The Temple of Jupiter was
located on the hill,

00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:21.070
at about the position of one of
the palaces that's there now.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.484
We mentioned last time--and any
of you who've been to Rome know

00:14:24.484 --> 00:14:27.191
this well--
that the Capitoline Hill was

00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:31.456
redesigned in the Renaissance by
none other than Michelangelo

00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:32.240
himself.
 

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.831
It was Michelangelo who was
responsible for creating the

00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:39.750
oval piazza that is at the
center of the Capitoline Hill,

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.879
which was then renamed the
Campidoglio of Rome,

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:46.462
and there are these three
palaces, designed also by

00:14:46.462 --> 00:14:48.404
Michelangelo,
the Capitoline,

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:51.899
the Conservatori,
and the Senatorial Palaces,

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:55.690
that serve today as two
museums, or a joined museum,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.773
one on either side,
and a governmental building in

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:00.690
the back.
 

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.320
And you can see that very well
here.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.784
So this is the Capitoline Hill
as it looks today,

00:15:05.784 --> 00:15:07.428
as redesigned by Michelangelo.
 

00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:11.086
But in Roman times it was the
location, or from the sixth

00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:12.000
century B.C.
 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.508
on, it was the location of the
Temple of Jupiter OMC,

00:15:16.508 --> 00:15:21.535
the chief temple of ancient
Rome, the most important temple

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:23.269
of ancient Rome.
 

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:25.278
What did that temple look like?
 

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:29.182
And again, this is extremely
important, not only for it,

00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:33.298
but for the rest of Roman
temple architecture over time.

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:35.825
Believe it or not,
we have quite a bit of

00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:36.519
evidence.
 

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.697
It's complicated by the fact
that this temple burned down

00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:42.480
quite a number of times
throughout its history.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.323
We know it was still standing,
by the way, in the fourth

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:47.599
century A.D.,
when it was described by a very

00:15:47.599 --> 00:15:48.529
famous writer.
 

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:51.110
So it had a very long history.
 

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:55.480
But it burned down several
times and it was rebuilt several

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.966
times,
and each time it was rebuilt it

00:15:57.966 --> 00:16:00.240
obviously was rebuilt in a new
style,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.860
whatever was au courant
at that time.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.590
So it changed considerably.
 

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.143
And nonetheless we do have
quite a bit of information about

00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:08.450
it.
 

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.169
As far as we can tell,
when it was put up in 509 B.C.

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:14.960
it looked something like this.
 

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.597
What you're seeing here is a
restored view and a plan of the

00:16:20.597 --> 00:16:22.509
temple in 509 B.C.
 

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:26.844
And it's never too soon in a
course on architecture to learn

00:16:26.844 --> 00:16:30.812
how to read a plan and how to
read a restored view or a

00:16:30.812 --> 00:16:33.090
so-called axonometric view.
 

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.857
And I have put on--you probably
haven't had a chance to look

00:16:33.857 --> 00:16:35.717
yet--
but I've put up on the website

00:16:35.717 --> 00:16:38.677
for this course,
both under Announcements and

00:16:38.677 --> 00:16:41.048
also in the Online Forum
section,

00:16:41.048 --> 00:16:46.259
a couple of sheets that I think
will be very helpful to you,

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:48.740
that have terms and concepts.
 

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:56.712
It has different kinds of
vaulting and different kinds of

00:16:56.712 --> 00:16:59.486
masonry,
and also tells you the

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:02.340
difference between an
axonometric view and a plan,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.250
and so on and so forth.
 

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.450
I really urge you to print
those out, look through them.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.968
In the beginning of this
semester we do have to spend a

00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:10.880
lot of time on what things are
called,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.940
but once we do that for a
couple of weeks,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.686
we'll be done with it and
you'll know all the basic terms

00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:17.650
and we'll be able to go on from
there.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.150
But I think you'll find those
handouts extremely helpful.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.630
So as we look at what we have
here, I think you can see by

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.172
looking at the plan that what we
are dealing with here is a

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.759
rectangular structure.
 

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:33.815
The rectangular structure has a
deep porch, and these circles

00:17:33.815 --> 00:17:37.193
are columns -- so with
freestanding columns in that

00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:37.868
porch.
 

00:17:37.868 --> 00:17:40.700
It has a single staircase at
the front.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.229
Having a single staircase,
rather than one that encircles

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.940
the building,
gives the building a focus;

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.869
there's a focus on the
façade for this

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:50.670
structure.
 

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.730
You can also see that the back
wall is plain;

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.598
the back wall is plain.
 

00:17:55.598 --> 00:17:58.654
And the cella,
c-e-l-l-a, which is the central

00:17:58.654 --> 00:18:02.930
space of the inside of a temple,
is divided into three parts.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.720
So a tripartite cella.
 

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.480
And why was there a tripartite
cella?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.950
You know the answer,
because there were three gods;

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.855
there was Jupiter,
Juno and Minerva,

00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:13.108
the Capitoline Triad.
 

00:18:13.108 --> 00:18:17.324
Each one had his own little
cella, with Jupiter obviously in

00:18:17.324 --> 00:18:21.608
the center, flanked by his two
ladies, one on either side.

00:18:21.608 --> 00:18:24.839
So whenever you see a building
with a triple cella,

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:28.910
you're going to know that's a
temple of the Capitoline Triad.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.993
We can see from the outside of
the structure,

00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:34.938
the restored view,
that it had a quite tall

00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:35.710
podium.
 

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.366
The podium was in fact thirteen
feet tall -- pretty significant,

00:18:40.366 --> 00:18:43.250
thirteen-foot tall podium right
here.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.950
And here you also see again the
single staircase in the front,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.371
the façade orientation,
the deep porch,

00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:51.259
the freestanding columns in
that porch,

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:55.644
and the triple entranceway into
the three cellas of the

00:18:55.644 --> 00:18:56.619
structure.
 

00:18:56.619 --> 00:18:58.220
So that's the basic plan.
 

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.472
Let me also mention the
materials for the Temple of

00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:05.286
Jupiter OMC,
in the sixth century B.C.,

00:19:05.286 --> 00:19:09.009
because technology is important
in any course on architecture.

00:19:09.009 --> 00:19:13.038
We know--and think back to what
we already know about the huts--

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:19.548
the building material used here
was wood for the columns and the

00:19:19.548 --> 00:19:23.865
superstructure,
just as we saw in the Palatine

00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:25.980
huts,
wood for the columns and the

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.858
superstructure.
 

00:19:26.858 --> 00:19:31.866
Mud-brick, not wattle and daub,
but mud-brick for the podium

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:36.150
and for the walls,
and then the structure had

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.904
quite a bit of decoration --
you don't see it here,

00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:42.730
but quite a bit of decoration,
sculptural decoration,

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.726
in ancient times,
and this was made out of

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:46.608
terracotta.
 

00:19:46.608 --> 00:19:51.099
So wood, mud-brick and
terracotta were the materials

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:54.269
used for this particular
building.

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:57.483
Oh I meant to show you--sorry,
let me just go back for a

00:19:57.483 --> 00:19:58.009
second.
 

00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:02.240
The reason that the other plan
is on the screen,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.176
the one at the left,
this is a plan of an Etruscan

00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:08.946
tomb,
the Tomb of the Shields and

00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:11.824
Seats from Cerveteri,
second half of the sixth

00:20:11.824 --> 00:20:14.048
century B.C.,
which is on your Monument List.

00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:16.798
I only bring it to your
attention because it's

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:20.463
interesting that the Etruscans
also divided the main space of

00:20:20.463 --> 00:20:24.170
that tomb into three spaces,
three separate spaces,

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.873
up at the top,
tripartite, and also gave it a

00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:31.766
single staircase,
which gave it a façade

00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:32.808
orientation.
 

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.880
I just mention that because
we'll see that those,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.440
especially that focus on the
façade,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.618
is an Etruscan element that is
picked up by the Romans.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:47.078
Roman architecture is very much
an architecture of facades,

00:20:47.078 --> 00:20:49.319
of the front of buildings,
with a focus on the front of

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:51.298
buildings,
and I wanted to make sure that

00:20:51.298 --> 00:20:53.598
you knew that not only in temple
architecture,

00:20:53.598 --> 00:20:56.529
but also in tomb architecture,
under the Etruscans,

00:20:56.529 --> 00:21:01.288
that was an approach that they
already took and that was

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:04.230
adopted from them by the Romans.
 

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.037
Another view also of the plan,
just so that you can see it

00:21:08.037 --> 00:21:10.910
again straight up,
with the focus on the

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.051
façade,
the single staircase,

00:21:13.051 --> 00:21:15.250
the deep porch,
the freestanding columns in

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.353
that porch,
and then the tripartite

00:21:18.353 --> 00:21:21.858
division and the flat back wall.
 

00:21:21.858 --> 00:21:25.290
Now I think it's important at
this juncture to make a

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:29.118
distinction between the most
important Etruscan temple,

00:21:29.118 --> 00:21:33.170
namely the Temple of Jupiter
OMC--and you see a model of that

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.503
here--
and the most important Greek,

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:41.078
ancient Greek temple,
the Parthenon in Athens.

00:21:41.078 --> 00:21:44.200
The Parthenon in Athens dates,
as you probably know,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.808
to the fifth century B.C.,
this to the sixth century B.C.

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:51.416
So they are not exactly
contemporary but roughly

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:53.720
contemporary to one another.
 

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.902
And as you look at this,
I think you can see for

00:21:56.902 --> 00:22:00.085
yourselves, although I will
point out, the major

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:02.318
distinctions between the two.
 

00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:05.130
And this is going to be very,
very important for today,

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.420
for today's lecture,
but also in the future,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.618
because what we're going to see
is that the Romans --

00:22:09.618 --> 00:22:12.296
when the Romans began to build
their own religious

00:22:12.296 --> 00:22:14.538
architecture,
they looked back to what had

00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:17.720
been done by the Greeks and what
had been done by the Etruscans.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.768
They picked and chose what they
liked in each,

00:22:20.768 --> 00:22:24.900
and they brought that together
in an entirely new creation.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.630
They mixed it up with their own
culture,

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.710
their own religion,
brought it together,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.067
an entirely new creation,
and created something

00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:35.720
distinctive that we know of as
the Roman temple.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.529
So what are the differences
between the two?

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:42.912
We've already talked about the
main features of the Etruscan

00:22:42.912 --> 00:22:47.220
temple, but what are the main
features of the Greek temple,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.779
of the Parthenon?
 

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:52.130
I think you can see that while
superficially they look alike,

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.885
they have columns that support
a triangular pediment and so on

00:22:54.885 --> 00:22:57.391
and so forth,
the major differences are--and

00:22:57.391 --> 00:22:59.410
you can't see all of those
here--

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.090
but the major differences are
that instead of sitting on a

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.476
high podium,
Greek temples sit on a much

00:23:06.476 --> 00:23:07.730
lower podium.
 

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.400
They have a staircase that
encircles the entire building;

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.397
no façade orientation
there, no single staircase on

00:23:14.397 --> 00:23:15.028
the front.
 

00:23:15.028 --> 00:23:17.940
The stairs encircle the entire
building,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.670
as you can kind of see here,
and there is a single cella--

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.434
they never used a triple cella,
as we see in the Capitoline

00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:27.019
temple.
 

00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:32.040
And the major difference
between the two perhaps is the

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.226
fact that this building is built
out of stone,

00:23:36.226 --> 00:23:37.900
out of marble.
 

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.038
The Greek building is built out
of marble.

00:23:40.038 --> 00:23:44.480
The Greeks are using marble
magnificently in the fifth

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.578
century B.C.,
and even before that.

00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:52.631
So no ordinary old wood columns
and mud-brick for them,

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.970
they were using marble.
 

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.519
So when we begin to see the
Romans--

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:59.906
and we'll see that today--using
stone for their temple

00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:03.084
architecture,
they are doing that under the

00:24:03.084 --> 00:24:07.788
very strong influence of Greece,
and that's extremely important

00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:11.930
in any assessment of early Roman
religious architecture.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.428
Another view,
and it's one that you have also

00:24:13.428 --> 00:24:16.665
on your Monument List,
showing the Capitoline Hill in

00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:19.626
Roman times,
showing you the situation of

00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:23.124
the Temple of Jupiter OMC in
relationship to the other

00:24:23.124 --> 00:24:26.818
buildings that were up on top of
the Capitoline Hill;

00:24:26.818 --> 00:24:29.943
mostly religious structures,
but I just wanted you to see it

00:24:29.943 --> 00:24:31.108
did not stand alone.
 

00:24:31.108 --> 00:24:33.430
Not all of these were built in
the sixth century B.C.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.509
already, but over time,
an accretion of other

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:37.348
buildings.
 

00:24:37.348 --> 00:24:40.128
Here you actually see the
temple in a somewhat later

00:24:40.128 --> 00:24:41.872
version, because,
as I mentioned,

00:24:41.872 --> 00:24:43.942
it burned down and it was
rebuilt many,

00:24:43.942 --> 00:24:44.868
many times.
 

00:24:44.868 --> 00:24:48.105
But you also can see here--this
is just useful in terms of Roman

00:24:48.105 --> 00:24:51.238
religious practice--the altar is
located not inside the temple

00:24:51.238 --> 00:24:53.728
but outside;
the religious service actually

00:24:53.728 --> 00:24:54.838
took place outside.
 

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:57.750
The priest would officiate
outside the temple,

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.726
and in fact very few were
allowed to go inside to see the

00:25:01.726 --> 00:25:05.038
sacred cult statues --
that was pretty much left for

00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:06.759
the priest and the priesthood.
 

00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:11.220
Just again to underscore the
importance of Google Earth,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.019
for anyone who was not here on
Tuesday,

00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:17.208
I mentioned at that time that
you cannot only go and fly over

00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:20.210
Rome as it looks today via
Google Earth,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.338
but they have just recently,
in the last few months,

00:25:22.338 --> 00:25:24.788
introduced an ancient Rome
version.

00:25:24.788 --> 00:25:27.410
So you can go,
and you click the right button,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.420
you click your mouse in such a
way,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.799
you can find that the whole
city will be completely

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.779
recreated into the ancient city.
 

00:25:37.779 --> 00:25:40.118
And I just wanted you--it's
much more abstract,

00:25:40.118 --> 00:25:43.326
but nonetheless it gives you a
sense of what many of these

00:25:43.326 --> 00:25:45.970
buildings looked like in ancient
Roman times.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.212
And this is a screenshot of the
Capitoline Hill,

00:25:50.212 --> 00:25:55.538
as it appears in the Google
ancient Rome version of Rome.

00:25:55.538 --> 00:25:58.010
You can't do this for the other
cities at this juncture,

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.269
just for the city of Rome.
 

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:03.068
But it's great fun to do,
and also very informative.

00:26:03.068 --> 00:26:06.789
Now what is actually left of
the temple?

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:10.367
We've looked at the Campidoglio;
we see Michelangelo's buildings

00:26:10.367 --> 00:26:11.140
are up there now.
 

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.880
What is actually left of the
Temple of Jupiter OMC?

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.009
Well you're looking at it right
here.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:20.769
It's the podium of the temple
-- still survives -- that

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:24.460
thirteen foot tall podium of the
Temple of Jupiter.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.380
We think this is a quite early
podium,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.358
maybe not as early as the sixth
century B.C.,

00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:32.949
but a very early podium from
the temple upon which the

00:26:32.949 --> 00:26:34.440
structure was built.
 

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.380
You can get a sense of the
height of these things.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.730
And again a characteristic of
Etruscan temple architecture,

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.795
and as we shall see of most
Roman temple architecture,

00:26:42.795 --> 00:26:44.759
is to have a very high podium.
 

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:49.448
We can see that podium here and
we can see how it is made

00:26:49.448 --> 00:26:50.618
technically.
 

00:26:50.618 --> 00:26:54.689
You can see it is made up of a
series of rectangular blocks

00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:58.617
that are placed one next to one
another and on top of one

00:26:58.617 --> 00:26:59.460
another.
 

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.980
This is technically called
ashlar masonry,

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.320
a-s-h-l-a-r,
ashlar masonry,

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:12.880
to build a wall with these
kinds of rectangular blocks

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.838
piled one on top of another.
 

00:27:16.838 --> 00:27:20.109
It's tufa stone in this
particular case once again,

00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:23.184
which was natural,
a tufa stone natural to Rome,

00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:23.970
t-u-f-a.
 

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:29.729
And this ashlar masonry;
again, a building technique

00:27:29.729 --> 00:27:34.642
that was particularly popular in
the fifth and fourth and third

00:27:34.642 --> 00:27:35.990
centuries B.C.
 

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.750
in Rome.
 

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.390
Now what went up after the
Temple of Jupiter OMC in Rome?

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.509
Quite a bit.
 

00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:47.982
This was a very inspiring
project, a very major project,

00:27:47.982 --> 00:27:51.709
and obviously it spawned a lot
of other building projects in

00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:52.529
the city.
 

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:55.479
Very few of those survive--I
can't show you much else from

00:27:55.479 --> 00:27:58.740
this particular period--and this
is for a variety of reasons.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.410
It has to do in part with those
fires that I mentioned.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.348
A lot of things burned and no
longer survive.

00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:08.058
It has to do with something I
mentioned also on Tuesday,

00:28:08.058 --> 00:28:11.269
and that is that some of these
buildings became quarries in

00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:13.757
later times,
with later patrons and

00:28:13.757 --> 00:28:17.900
architects using them as a
source of stone that could be

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.009
used in later structures.
 

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:24.828
So many of them were dismantled
to be used for other buildings.

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:27.490
And also any city that is
inhabited,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.798
as Rome has been,
for two-and-a-half millennia,

00:28:29.798 --> 00:28:33.673
is obviously going to lose a
certain amount of its structures

00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:34.450
over time.
 

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.846
They're going to be torn down,
they're going to be rebuilt,

00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:38.580
they're going to be
incorporated into other

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.160
buildings.
 

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.295
Some of those that have
survived best are those that

00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:43.390
were actually incorporated into
other buildings.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.288
And indeed, that's what
happened here.

00:28:45.288 --> 00:28:49.906
The wall was incorporated into
something else and built on top

00:28:49.906 --> 00:28:52.858
of, and that's why it still
survives.

00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:57.019
So we don't have all that much
again besides this.

00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:00.644
But even if we had,
whatever was standing in the

00:29:00.644 --> 00:29:04.961
fifth and fourth centuries,
or early fourth century B.C.,

00:29:04.961 --> 00:29:08.509
would have been destroyed in
the year 386.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:12.425
Because in the year 386 B.C.,
a group of tribes,

00:29:12.425 --> 00:29:15.675
the Gallic tribes,
the Gauls, came down,

00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:17.259
from the north.
 

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:20.558
They destroyed everything in
their path.

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:24.538
They did a lot of damage to the
Etruscan settlements around

00:29:24.538 --> 00:29:25.980
Florence and so on.
 

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.028
They destroyed those.
 

00:29:27.028 --> 00:29:31.088
They came into Rome and they
set the city of Rome ablaze.

00:29:31.088 --> 00:29:34.548
And when the smoke cleared,
and it did eventually clear,

00:29:34.548 --> 00:29:40.084
the only building that was
still standing was the Temple of

00:29:40.084 --> 00:29:43.710
Jupiter Optimus Maximus
Capitolinus.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.730
That's how much destruction
there was.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.696
And so there's very little else
that we can look at from this

00:29:49.696 --> 00:29:51.019
particular period.
 

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:54.766
What the sack of the Gauls did
was also convince the Romans

00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:58.190
that they had not protected
their city well enough.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.058
Right?
 

00:29:59.058 --> 00:30:02.700
They were completely exposed,
and the entire city was burned,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.460
except for that one temple.
 

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.116
So they realized that they
better get smart and they better

00:30:08.116 --> 00:30:11.852
start to wall their cities,
to begin to put protective

00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:14.970
walls around the perimeter of
those cities.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:20.171
And we see a great
efflorescence of wall building

00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:24.288
therefore after the sack of 386
B.C.

00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:29.288
And I want to turn to that wall
construction right now.

00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:33.087
I want to begin with the most
important wall that was put up

00:30:33.087 --> 00:30:36.852
in the fourth century B.C.,
right after the Gallic sack,

00:30:36.852 --> 00:30:39.598
and this was the wall around
Rome itself.

00:30:39.598 --> 00:30:42.019
Rome was encircled with a stone
circuit;

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:46.863
a stone circuit that went
around the entire seven hills,

00:30:46.863 --> 00:30:51.883
the famous Seven Hills of Rome,
enclosing it in this stone

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:52.940
circuit.
 

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.298
And fortunately some parts of
that wall are still preserved

00:30:57.298 --> 00:30:57.900
today.
 

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.519
And I show you the most
extensive section here.

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:03.523
This is called the Servian
Walls--you can see this on your

00:31:03.523 --> 00:31:07.651
Monument List--
Servian Walls in Rome -- dates

00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:10.981
to 378 B.C.,
right after the sack,

00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:15.190
not long after the sack,
378 B.C.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:20.519
And some extensive sections of
that wall are preserved.

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:24.444
The most extensive is the
section near Rome's main train

00:31:24.444 --> 00:31:26.730
station, the Stazione Termini.
 

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.419
You can see the Stazione--a
modern building--you can see the

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:31.470
Stazione Termini in the upper
right corner.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.446
And here is a view of this
extensive section of the Servian

00:31:36.446 --> 00:31:37.818
Walls in Rome.
 

00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:40.160
The Romans didn't want to take
any chances.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.842
They decided,
even though their tufa was

00:31:41.842 --> 00:31:44.681
pretty good,
they decided they wanted to use

00:31:44.681 --> 00:31:48.714
the finest tufa possible,
and so they brought it in from

00:31:48.714 --> 00:31:52.118
the Etruscan city of Veii,
V-e-i-i.

00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:55.238
Veii was a famous and important
Etruscan city,

00:31:55.238 --> 00:31:58.150
that the Romans had just made
their own.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.267
So it was a perfect source for
them of outstanding building

00:32:02.267 --> 00:32:05.494
materials,
and they brought in an imported

00:32:05.494 --> 00:32:09.005
yellowish tufa,
from the Etruscan town of Veii,

00:32:09.005 --> 00:32:11.538
to use for this very
significant,

00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:15.948
very important wall that was
going to protect them from this

00:32:15.948 --> 00:32:16.920
time forth.
 

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.890
And you see that wall again
here.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.615
It is very weathered;
even though it still stands,

00:32:22.615 --> 00:32:23.608
it's very weathered.
 

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:27.838
So the stones don't look as
expertly carved as they would've

00:32:27.838 --> 00:32:29.990
been in ancient Roman times.
 

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.190
And what you can--it's hard to
see here,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.828
and I'll show you better in a
different wall shortly,

00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:38.791
but what it's hard to see is
the system of what are called

00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:42.269
headers and stretchers;
headers and stretchers that

00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:43.880
they used for this wall.
 

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.364
What a header is,
you take the same size

00:32:47.364 --> 00:32:51.559
rectangular block,
but when you put the short side

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:53.611
out,
facing out, that's a header,

00:32:53.611 --> 00:32:57.099
and when you put the long side
of the rectangle facing out,

00:32:57.099 --> 00:32:58.608
that's a stretcher.
 

00:32:58.608 --> 00:33:02.088
So it was an alternating
headers and stretchers.

00:33:02.088 --> 00:33:04.713
Again, I'll show you that
better in another wall

00:33:04.713 --> 00:33:07.730
momentarily, but use of headers
and stretchers here.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.390
And we can also see that the
blocks are quite regular.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:16.828
We are dealing with what we
call ashlar masonry,

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.880
once again, the same kind of
construction,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.230
this placement of these fairly
regular blocks,

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.579
one next to one another and one
on top of one another,

00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:26.730
ashlar masonry.
 

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.952
In Latin the term is
opus, o-p-u-s,

00:33:29.952 --> 00:33:32.704
quadratum,
q-u-a-d-r-a-t-u-m:

00:33:32.704 --> 00:33:35.298
opus quadratum.
 

00:33:35.298 --> 00:33:38.324
So you can call this either
ashlar masonry or opus

00:33:38.324 --> 00:33:40.068
quadratum:
squared work.

00:33:40.068 --> 00:33:44.818
The same sort of thing as we
saw in the podium of Jupiter

00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:48.635
OMC, being used for the Servian
Walls in Rome,

00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:49.568
in 378.
 

00:33:49.568 --> 00:33:52.298
I showed you last time this
section of the Servian Walls.

00:33:52.298 --> 00:33:56.015
Here you can get a much better
sense of the coloration of that

00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:57.660
yellowish tufa from Veii.
 

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.608
This is also very weathered,
so it's hard to see the headers

00:34:00.608 --> 00:34:02.837
and stretchers,
but it's another section of

00:34:02.837 --> 00:34:05.940
wall--just in case any of you
are going to Rome anytime soon--

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.780
that one can see on the
Aventine Hill,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.710
which is a beautiful
residential hill in Rome,

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:16.039
one of the most lovely places
to wander in the entire city.

00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:18.811
You will come across another
section--you never know when

00:34:18.811 --> 00:34:20.889
little pieces of antiquity will
crop up.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:24.052
They come up in the most
unusual places as one wanders

00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:27.635
the city, which is one of the
reasons it's such a fascinating

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:28.768
place to visit.
 

00:34:28.768 --> 00:34:31.579
Now the Romans realized--what
was going on at the same time is

00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:34.018
the Romans were beginning to
extensively colonize--

00:34:34.018 --> 00:34:37.440
well they had these
imperialistic ambitions.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.048
They wanted to colonize the
world, but they began with the

00:34:40.048 --> 00:34:42.849
places closest to them,
and they began to build

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:46.565
extensive colonies in Italy,
especially in an area very

00:34:46.565 --> 00:34:48.679
close to the city of Rome
itself.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.550
And they recognized,
as they began to build,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.179
what I mentioned to you last
time I like to call mini-Romes,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.851
because these are little cities
in the version of the capital

00:34:58.851 --> 00:34:59.710
city itself.
 

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.250
As they began to build these
mini-Romes,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:07.909
they recognized that these
mini-Romes also needed security,

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:11.547
also needed to be protected by
walls that were comparable to

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:12.780
the Servian Walls.
 

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.860
So we see this great
efflorescence,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.391
not only of colonization,
but also of wall building in

00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:22.190
the period following the sack
and the period following the

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.190
construction of Rome's own
Servian Walls.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.099
And I want to show you a few
examples of that.

00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:31.219
This is a map that was
custom-made for this course.

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:34.304
You can find it on the web
portal, and I think you'll find

00:35:34.304 --> 00:35:36.603
it very useful,
because what I've done here

00:35:36.603 --> 00:35:38.826
obviously is focus on--
I don't clutter it up with a

00:35:38.826 --> 00:35:40.210
lot of places we're not looking
at--

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:43.762
I focus on the towns that we
are actually going to be looking

00:35:43.762 --> 00:35:44.829
at buildings in.
 

00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:46.690
So I think you'll find it
extremely helpful.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.199
Rome is here at the star.
 

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:50.800
You can actually click on the
map and that will take you to a

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.710
map of Rome itself.
 

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.112
But we see the star where Rome
is, and the towns that I'm going

00:35:55.112 --> 00:35:57.782
to take you to,
that have walls,

00:35:57.782 --> 00:36:01.639
are the city of Cosa,
the town, the village really at

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:04.117
that time, of Cosa;
the town of Norba,

00:36:04.117 --> 00:36:08.329
that you see over here;
and the town of Falerii Novi.

00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:11.838
But I wanted to show you the
map, because you see how close,

00:36:11.838 --> 00:36:14.929
how proximate they are to the
city of Rome itself.

00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:17.739
I'm going to show you these
fairly rapidly,

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:20.827
just to give you a sense again
of the kind of wall construction

00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:22.670
that was going on in the
colonies,

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.750
in the Italian colonies,
at this time.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.239
This is--we'll look first at
the city walls of the town of

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:28.730
Norba.
 

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.809
And you can see from the
Monument List that dates to the

00:36:31.809 --> 00:36:34.050
second half of the fourth
century B.C.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.101
And as you look at these walls,
these are not done out of tufa

00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:41.355
but a local stone to Norba,
more grayish in color,

00:36:41.355 --> 00:36:42.949
as you can see here.
 

00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:46.114
But you can tell me yourselves
right off, that's not opus

00:36:46.114 --> 00:36:48.420
quadratum,
that's not ashlar masonry.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.429
The blocks are not rectangular
and they're not that even;

00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:55.072
in fact, they're multi-sided
blocks, some of them are

00:36:55.072 --> 00:36:56.039
polygonal blocks.
 

00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:59.349
And we technically call this
polygonal masonry.

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:01.219
And they've taken these
multi-sided blocks,

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:03.199
piled them up,
in a very interesting way,

00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:06.572
to create a very handsome
wall--I like this wall a lot

00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:09.442
myself--
a very handsome wall to

00:37:09.442 --> 00:37:12.159
encircle the town of Norba.
 

00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:15.949
So polygonal masonry in this
particular instance.

00:37:15.949 --> 00:37:19.699
And we see the same use of
polygonal masonry at the town of

00:37:19.699 --> 00:37:23.385
Cosa, which is north of Norba,
as you'll remember from the

00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:25.519
custom map, the town of Cosa.
 

00:37:25.519 --> 00:37:28.800
The walls date to 273 B.C.
 

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.309
at Cosa, and you see glimpses
of them here.

00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:35.494
And I think you can see once
again a grayish stone used for

00:37:35.494 --> 00:37:39.608
these walls, and you can see
that the construction is once

00:37:39.608 --> 00:37:41.630
again polygonal masonry.
 

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.480
The pièce de
résistance,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.945
the greatest masterwork of
Roman wall design in this early

00:37:48.945 --> 00:37:52.000
period is the wall that you see
here.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.719
This is the wall at Falerii
Novi.

00:37:54.719 --> 00:38:00.923
Falerii Novi was founded as a
colony in 241 B.C.,

00:38:00.923 --> 00:38:07.775
and the walls were put up
sometime between 241 and 200

00:38:07.775 --> 00:38:08.809
B.C.
 

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:11.681
And we see them here,
and you can see that the wall

00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:14.608
also had a quite spectacular,
at least for its date,

00:38:14.608 --> 00:38:16.159
quite spectacular gate.
 

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:17.539
Now if we look at the walls
first--

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:20.349
actually, first of all I want
to point out that they have

00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:23.110
chosen to use two different
kinds of materials here,

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.518
as is immediately apparent as
you look at this color view.

00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:31.460
They chose to use a grey
peperino stone,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.940
p-e-p-e-r-i-n-o,
a grey peperino stone,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:40.730
from the Alban Hills,
for the arch of the gateway,

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:47.920
and to use a reddish-brown tufa
for the walls themselves.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.579
A reddish-brown tufa,
peperino, grey peperino stone,

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:53.230
from the Alban Hills.
 

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.163
So they were very careful about
their selection of materials,

00:38:57.163 --> 00:39:00.704
in part to emphasize this
distinction in texture and in

00:39:00.704 --> 00:39:01.360
color.
 

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.481
If you look at the wall you can
see we're dealing here clearly

00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.103
with ashlar masonry,
with opus quadratrum,

00:39:07.103 --> 00:39:09.219
and here you can see much more
clearly,

00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:11.273
than any of the other walls
I've shown you because they're

00:39:11.273 --> 00:39:14.085
so well preserved,
the headers and the stretchers,

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:17.268
the alternating square and
rectangular blocks,

00:39:17.268 --> 00:39:21.704
the scheme of headers and
stretchers that is used for this

00:39:21.704 --> 00:39:22.250
wall.
 

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.554
The most important part,
of course, is the arch,

00:39:24.554 --> 00:39:25.389
the stone arch.
 

00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:27.750
It's a masonry arch,
as you can see.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.168
It's not the earliest arch in
Roman architecture,

00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:31.730
but it's one of the earliest.
 

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:37.400
It has been amazingly done,
I think quite masterfully done.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.431
If you look at it,
you will see that what the

00:39:40.431 --> 00:39:45.050
designer has achieved is to take
a series of wedge-shaped blocks.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.719
These are called
voussoir blocks--

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:49.929
I put that word on the Monument
List for you--

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.110
voussoir blocks,
these wedge-shaped blocks,

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:57.019
and has carved them in such a
way that each one fits very

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:01.579
effectively and very well into
the overall scheme.

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:03.420
They're wedged in next to one
another.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.088
In fact, as you gaze at it,
you kind of think:

00:40:05.088 --> 00:40:07.364
"Gee,
I wonder if any of those blocks

00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:10.199
are going to fall out from where
they are?"

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:12.644
But they don't because they're
wedged in so closely,

00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:13.699
next to one another.
 

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:18.898
And then they have finished the
line of the arch very nicely so

00:40:18.898 --> 00:40:22.590
that it has a very attractive
appearance,

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.396
and because it is done in a
different stone it stands out

00:40:26.396 --> 00:40:29.320
extremely well from the rest of
the wall.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.777
This is really again a
masterful treatment,

00:40:31.777 --> 00:40:34.233
in my opinion,
of a wall at this particular

00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:37.159
time, with the wonderful
addition of the arch.

00:40:37.159 --> 00:40:41.016
And I think we begin to see--we
talked last time about how

00:40:41.016 --> 00:40:45.211
important making of arches and
vaults and especially the use of

00:40:45.211 --> 00:40:47.739
concrete--
although here we see a stone

00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:49.320
arch, clearly a stone arch.
 

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.867
But we're going to see that the
capacity of the arch to be used

00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:59.878
for expressive purposes in
architecture is capitalized on

00:40:59.878 --> 00:41:01.489
by the Romans.
 

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:04.699
And I wanted you to be
aware--this is not only

00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:08.838
important as a wall of this
period but important in the way

00:41:08.838 --> 00:41:13.262
that it's prescient of what's to
come with regard to the way in

00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:17.257
which the Romans are going to
start to deploy the arch in

00:41:17.257 --> 00:41:20.967
extraordinarily creative and
innovative ways in Roman

00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:22.610
architecture.
 

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.590
It all begins here.
 

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:28.898
The wall and gate of Falerii
Novi stand at the beginning of

00:41:28.898 --> 00:41:33.659
this incredible development in
Roman architecture.

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:37.387
I want to say something very,
very quickly about town

00:41:37.387 --> 00:41:41.570
planning during this period,
because just as I mentioned,

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.630
Romans were colonizing towns in
Italy and they were putting

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.320
walls around them,
but they were also beginning to

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.067
think about how they thought
about city construction in

00:41:53.067 --> 00:41:55.806
general,
or the making of urban spaces

00:41:55.806 --> 00:41:58.570
and places during this
particular period.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.130
So I just want to show you
fleetingly two examples.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.938
The town of Cosa,
of which we've already looked

00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:06.380
at the walls,
dating to the third century

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:06.869
B.C.
 

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:11.434
And it's worth noting that it
was again after the sack of 386

00:42:11.434 --> 00:42:15.389
that this explosion of town
building really began.

00:42:15.389 --> 00:42:18.489
As we look at the town plan of
Cosa,

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:21.119
you can see that it is
encircled by the wall that we

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.981
looked at just before,
and you can also see it's

00:42:23.981 --> 00:42:28.159
roughly regular in shape,
roughly kind of a square.

00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:30.960
As you can see here,
there are gates in the walls,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.956
and then there is a scheme of
streets that is comparable to

00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:39.159
what I mentioned last time was
typical for an ideal Roman city

00:42:39.159 --> 00:42:41.269
plan,
and that is the two main

00:42:41.269 --> 00:42:44.585
streets, the cardo and
the decumanus of the

00:42:44.585 --> 00:42:45.059
city.
 

00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:48.219
The cardo being the
north-south main street,

00:42:48.219 --> 00:42:50.518
and the decumanus being
the east-west street,

00:42:50.518 --> 00:42:54.260
and them intersecting very
close to the center of the city.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.268
And it's usually very close to
that same center that you find

00:42:57.268 --> 00:42:59.264
the forum,
or a great open space,

00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:01.590
meeting and marketplace of the
city,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.769
as well as a host of other
buildings: basilica,

00:43:04.769 --> 00:43:06.309
market, and so on.
 

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:09.849
And then, on the highest hill
of the town of Cosa,

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:12.476
a Capitolium,
a temple to Jupiter,

00:43:12.476 --> 00:43:15.914
Juno and Minerva,
on that highest spot,

00:43:15.914 --> 00:43:20.570
the most important religious
structure of that town.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.599
That's the town of Cosa.
 

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:25.050
And then the other more
important one is the town of

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.128
Ostia,
the port of Rome,

00:43:27.128 --> 00:43:31.969
the town of Ostia which was
first founded in 350 B.C.,

00:43:31.969 --> 00:43:36.173
and it was at that time a
military camp or castrum

00:43:36.173 --> 00:43:39.561
was--
c-a-s-t-r-u-m--a castrum

00:43:39.561 --> 00:43:41.409
was laid out there.
 

00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:43.429
And you can see a plan of that
castrum.

00:43:43.429 --> 00:43:47.681
You see the dark dotted lines
here is the original plan of

00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:48.949
Ostia, 350 B.C.
 

00:43:48.949 --> 00:43:52.081
All the rest that you see
around it is the city as it grew

00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:55.489
into the second century A.D.,
when it had its efflorescence.

00:43:55.489 --> 00:43:57.480
So we see the original city
here.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.570
And you can see it is perfectly
regular.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.405
And I mentioned to you last
time that this is very different

00:44:02.405 --> 00:44:03.800
from what happened in Rome.
 

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.440
Rome grew in a very haphazard
way over the centuries.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.800
There was never any real
attempt to plan the city.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.219
But when the Romans were left
to build the kind of ideal city,

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.409
the city that they thought was
the ideal Roman city,

00:44:17.409 --> 00:44:21.159
they almost always built it in
a very regular fashion,

00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:24.228
as a square or as a rectangle,
as regular as they could make

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.713
it,
and it varied depending upon

00:44:25.713 --> 00:44:26.260
the terrain.
 

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.253
If there were a lot of hills
and so on, it might end up with

00:44:29.253 --> 00:44:30.980
a somewhat more irregular shape.
 

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.789
But here you see it at its most
regular,

00:44:32.789 --> 00:44:35.760
planned like a castrum
or a military camp,

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.130
rectangular with the two main
streets,

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.239
the cardo,
the north-south street,

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:43.239
the decumanus,
the east-west street,

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:45.960
crossing exactly at the center
of the city.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.550
And then what's located there?
 

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.117
The forum of the city,
the great open meeting and

00:44:50.117 --> 00:44:52.773
marketplace,
and then all the other major

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:56.250
buildings deployed around that,
and then, of course,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.994
the residential structures and
the shops interspersed among

00:44:59.994 --> 00:45:04.327
those,
in this typical Roman town plan

00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:07.539
of the fourth century B.C.
 

00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:10.487
I want to spend the rest of
today's lecture on the three

00:45:10.487 --> 00:45:13.615
most important buildings,
in a sense, that I'm going to

00:45:13.615 --> 00:45:15.735
show you today,
vis-à-vis the

00:45:15.735 --> 00:45:18.420
development of Roman religious
architecture,

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.659
specifically temple
architecture.

00:45:20.659 --> 00:45:22.880
And I think I'm going to
actually call for your help.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.349
You've learned a lot already
and I think you now know enough

00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:29.641
to help me along a little bit
here on sorting out some of

00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:30.699
these temples.
 

00:45:30.699 --> 00:45:33.748
One of them is located in Rome
and the other two are located

00:45:33.748 --> 00:45:34.679
outside of Rome.
 

00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:37.809
I'll show you the map again in
a second so that you can see

00:45:37.809 --> 00:45:39.320
where those other two are.
 

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.969
But I'm going to begin with the
one in Rome,

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:44.570
which takes me back to Google
Earth here,

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.251
to show you the situation of
the so-called Temple of Portunus

00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:50.911
in Rome,
that dates to,

00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:54.889
we believe, sometime--
it was put up sometime between

00:45:54.889 --> 00:45:56.309
120 and 80 B.C.
 

00:45:56.309 --> 00:46:00.119
in Rome.
 

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:01.018
You're going to get so good at
this that you're going to be

00:46:01.018 --> 00:46:01.780
able to point all these places
out, without me.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.230
But we're looking back again
over--this is the Palatine Hill.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.123
We're looking at a slightly
different angle,

00:46:08.123 --> 00:46:09.268
Palatine Hill over here.
 

00:46:09.268 --> 00:46:12.739
The very edge of the Colosseum
you can see in the upper left.

00:46:12.739 --> 00:46:15.505
The great Via dei Fori
Imperiali of Mussolini over

00:46:15.505 --> 00:46:15.900
here.
 

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.409
The Imperial Fora here.
 

00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:20.005
The wedding cake of Victor
Emmanuel, the Vittoriano,

00:46:20.005 --> 00:46:22.858
that I showed you last time,
over here -- the more modern

00:46:22.858 --> 00:46:23.519
building.
 

00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:24.559
The Capitoline Hill.
 

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:26.929
You can see the oval piazza of
Michelangelo right here.

00:46:26.929 --> 00:46:32.300
And the Circus Maximus over
here.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.059
And for any of you who've been
to Rome, the Isola Tiberina,

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:39.949
that wonderful little island
that one can cross the bridge to

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:41.960
get to, in Rome,
down here.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.474
So here's the Tiber River,
looking nasty as it usually

00:46:45.474 --> 00:46:45.940
does.
 

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.228
It's very green and not the
sort of place you'd want to take

00:46:50.228 --> 00:46:52.920
a swim in, as you can well
imagine.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.360
But you see the Tiber River
here.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.289
And if you look very closely,
you will see two temples.

00:46:58.289 --> 00:47:01.050
This is a round temple,
which has a very uninventive--

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.309
it's called today,
very uninventively,

00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:06.666
the Round Temple by the Tiber,
the Round Temple by the Tiber

00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:07.920
for obvious reasons.
 

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.483
And then here a rectangular
temple that looks like it has a

00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:14.862
red roof because it's been
undergoing reconstruction and

00:47:14.862 --> 00:47:16.400
restoration recently.
 

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.739
You see that here.
 

00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:19.579
This is the Temple of Portunus.
 

00:47:19.579 --> 00:47:22.514
So you can see,
in conjunction to another

00:47:22.514 --> 00:47:25.742
temple, it was built very close
to the river,

00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:27.429
to the Tiber River.
 

00:47:27.429 --> 00:47:30.990
Now let's look at the plan
together of the Temple of

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.760
Portunus.
 

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:36.197
Based on your understanding now
of typical Etruscan religious

00:47:36.197 --> 00:47:38.860
architecture,
typical Greek religious

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.965
architecture,
what would you say about this

00:47:41.965 --> 00:47:42.780
plan?
 

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.974
Is this more like an Etruscan
temple or more like a Greek

00:47:46.974 --> 00:47:47.650
temple?
 

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.380
I can't remember if I--I think
I forgot to mention,

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.425
with regard to the Parthenon,
that not only does the typical

00:47:52.425 --> 00:47:54.489
Greek temple of the fifth
century B.C.

00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:57.579
have a staircase that encircles
the entire monument,

00:47:57.579 --> 00:48:02.369
it has a colonnade,
a freestanding colonnade,

00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:02.869
that encircles the entire
monument,

00:48:02.869 --> 00:48:07.760
and that's called a peripteral,
p-e-r-i-p-t-e-r-a-l,

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.760
a peripteral colonnade.
 

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.242
So based on what you know about
the Temple of Jupiter OMC and

00:48:14.242 --> 00:48:17.472
the Parthenon in Athens,
does this plan--in plan,

00:48:17.472 --> 00:48:21.177
when we look at this building--
does this look more like an

00:48:21.177 --> 00:48:23.960
Etruscan plan or like a Greek
plan?

00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:28.170
Okay Mr.***Roma.
 

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.030
Student:  I'd say it's
more of a combination.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.300
Prof: Good.
 

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.014
Student:  With the
peripteral colonnade and also

00:48:33.014 --> 00:48:34.293
the --
Prof: All right,

00:48:34.293 --> 00:48:34.769
all right.
 

00:48:34.769 --> 00:48:36.010
Okay. Yes.
 

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:37.960
It looks like it might be a
combination.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.039
Give me what the Etruscan
characteristics are first.

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:44.420
Student:  Well I think
the Etruscan would be the single

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.360
staircase, of course,
and also the three entrances;

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.449
so you've got a triad maybe.
 

00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:49.880
Prof: All right.
 

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.246
The single staircase,
absolutely, which gives it a

00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:55.170
façade orientation.
 

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.750
Is there a triple entranceway?
 

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.070
There are spaces between the
columns.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.190
These are columns here.
 

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.539
Student: 
&gt;

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:02.699
Prof: But look at the
cella.

00:49:02.699 --> 00:49:03.800
Student:  Over there the
cella's a single cella.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.019
Prof: The cella's a
single cella.

00:49:05.019 --> 00:49:06.630
So this is not a Capitolium.
 

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.996
But there are spaces,
you're right,

00:49:07.996 --> 00:49:08.880
between the columns.
 

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.789
So take us a little further
with the columns.

00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:14.675
You can see the columns in a
deep porch, deep porch,

00:49:14.675 --> 00:49:16.786
freestanding;
columns in the front are

00:49:16.786 --> 00:49:17.349
freestanding.
 

00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:20.400
So façade orientation,
single staircase,

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.849
deep porch, freestanding
columns in that porch,

00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:25.400
in this case a single
cella--those are all Etruscan

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.320
characteristics.
 

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.003
So it looks as if we are
dealing here essentially with an

00:49:29.003 --> 00:49:29.768
Etruscan plan.
 

00:49:29.768 --> 00:49:30.739
But you're right--what's your
name?

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:31.768
Student: 
&gt;

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.847
Prof: Neil was right,
however, that this is a

00:49:34.847 --> 00:49:38.164
combination in that there are
columns that go around the

00:49:38.164 --> 00:49:38.949
monument.
 

00:49:38.949 --> 00:49:41.219
But is it a peripteral
colonnade?

00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:43.510
Student:  Probably not.
 

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:44.280
Prof: Probably not.
 

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.559
Why not?
 

00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:47.059
Because what's different about
these columns?

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:49.690
You can see it in plan.
 

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.619
They go all the way around
but--

00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:52.400
Student:  They're not
freestanding.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.199
Prof: They're not
freestanding.

00:49:53.199 --> 00:49:56.909
They're attached or engaged
into the wall.

00:49:56.909 --> 00:49:58.010
They're attached to the wall.
 

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.420
What do we call that?
 

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.099
We call that a
pseudo-peripteral colonnade.

00:50:03.099 --> 00:50:05.369
So yes, it kind of looks like
it goes around,

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:08.277
but it doesn't really because
it's attached into the wall and

00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:11.039
it kind of gives that sense of
flatness that we got in the

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:12.010
Etruscan temple.
 

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.239
So you were absolutely on the
mark.

00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:15.570
It's a combination of the two.
 

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.427
And that is exactly what we see
coming together at this

00:50:18.427 --> 00:50:20.969
particular time in Roman temple
architecture,

00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:24.376
this wonderful way in which the
Romans have looked at Etruscan

00:50:24.376 --> 00:50:26.112
precedents,
they've looked at Greek

00:50:26.112 --> 00:50:26.610
precedents.
 

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.460
They decide what they like.
 

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.369
They mix it up,
as I said before,

00:50:30.369 --> 00:50:33.829
in a way in which it best
represents their own culture,

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:36.786
their own religion,
and create something that we're

00:50:36.786 --> 00:50:39.329
going to see becomes
distinctively Roman.

00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:41.994
The building is very well
preserved, so we can go on to

00:50:41.994 --> 00:50:43.079
actually look at it.
 

00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:44.110
Here it is.
 

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.081
It stands in almost pristine
shape in Rome today,

00:50:47.081 --> 00:50:49.869
right near the Tiber River,
as I mentioned.

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:53.641
A wonderful temple in which we
see some of those features that

00:50:53.641 --> 00:50:56.827
Neil has already pointed to,
and that is the façade

00:50:56.827 --> 00:50:58.804
orientation,
the single staircase,

00:50:58.804 --> 00:51:01.072
the deep porch,
the freestanding columns in

00:51:01.072 --> 00:51:01.590
that porch.
 

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:03.730
From a distance it does indeed
look peripteral.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.659
It looks like there are columns
all the way around.

00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:08.739
But as you look closely you
will see that the columns are

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:10.940
indeed attached to the wall,
on the side,

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.590
and around the other side.
 

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.744
Now that you see the actual
view, there are some other

00:51:15.744 --> 00:51:19.773
things that give this away,
as a temple that has clearly

00:51:19.773 --> 00:51:23.860
also been built under very
strong Greek influence.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.030
And what are those?
 

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.199
Student:  Stone.
 

00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:28.980
Prof: Stone -- yes
absolutely.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.239
This is not made--this is not a
wooden, mud-brick,

00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:33.570
terracotta temple.
 

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.500
This is a temple that is made
out of stone.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:41.199
It's not made out of marble,
it's made out of travertine.

00:51:41.199 --> 00:51:44.518
It has travertine,
t-r-a-v-e-r-t-i-n-e.

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:48.775
Travertine is an Italian stone
brought from or quarried at town

00:51:48.775 --> 00:51:52.483
of Tivoli, T-i-v-o-l-i,
which we'll talk about a lot in

00:51:52.483 --> 00:51:54.679
the course of this semester.
 

00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:58.550
Travertine brought--Tivoli's
about an hour's high-speed drive

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.518
today from Rome,
obviously longer in antiquity,

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.969
but it's fairly proximate to
Rome.

00:52:03.969 --> 00:52:07.181
So this wonderful stone,
travertine, from Tivoli,

00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:10.057
brought to serve as a facing
for the podium,

00:52:10.057 --> 00:52:13.070
and for the columns,
used in the columns.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:16.030
So it is essentially a stone
structure.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.300
We'll see that the walls are
made of tufa,

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.380
but those walls were stuccoed
over with white stucco,

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.619
so that the impression that you
would've gotten,

00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:27.405
if you were in ancient times
when this was in more pristine

00:52:27.405 --> 00:52:29.557
condition,
was that you were looking at a

00:52:29.557 --> 00:52:31.739
white marble temple,
which would've certainly

00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:34.300
conjured up the idea that you
were looking at a temple that

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.980
was made à
la Greque;

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.268
that was made in the Greek
style.

00:52:38.268 --> 00:52:40.510
Anything else that gives away
the influence of Greek

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.170
architecture?
 

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:43.760
Do any of you know your orders?
 

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.110
Student:  Ionic order
columns.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:49.679
Prof: Ionic order. Good;
I-o-n-i-c, Ionic.

00:52:49.679 --> 00:52:51.922
The three major--and you'll
find this in your Terms and

00:52:51.922 --> 00:52:52.380
Concepts.
 

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.018
So bone up on those there.
 

00:52:54.018 --> 00:52:56.684
The Doric, the Ionic and the
Corinthian, and we'll look at

00:52:56.684 --> 00:52:57.619
all of them today.
 

00:52:57.619 --> 00:53:00.300
The Ionic order,
what characterizes the Ionic

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.103
order are these what are called
spiral volutes,

00:53:03.103 --> 00:53:05.360
v-o-l-u-t-e-s;
spiral volutes.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.150
And you can see those here.
 

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:10.500
This is a typical Ionic column
clearly made--

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.940
we don't see the Etruscans
using this--

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.929
clearly made under the
influence, the very strong

00:53:14.929 --> 00:53:17.570
influence,
of Greek architecture,

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:19.820
Greek temple architecture.
 

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:23.402
Here's a view of the Temple of
Portunus, from the side,

00:53:23.402 --> 00:53:24.730
and from the rear.
 

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:28.068
We once again see the way those
columns encircle the structure

00:53:28.068 --> 00:53:29.820
but are engaged into the wall.
 

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.460
You can also see the blocks of
tufa stone, ashlar blocks,

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:37.360
just as we saw them in the
walls, of tufa stone used here.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.349
And you can get some sense
there're some remains of some of

00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:42.719
the stucco that was stuccoed
over in white,

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:45.376
so that from a distance,
at least, you would have the

00:53:45.376 --> 00:53:48.389
impression that the whole
building was made out of stone.

00:53:48.389 --> 00:53:51.394
And even stone--you might even
be fooled into thinking it

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.112
wasn't travertine,
it was marble,

00:53:53.112 --> 00:53:54.829
if you were far enough away.
 

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:58.182
I also need to mention
something very important for the

00:53:58.182 --> 00:54:01.536
future of Roman architecture,
and that is that concrete

00:54:01.536 --> 00:54:04.019
construction was used in the
podium.

00:54:04.019 --> 00:54:05.070
You don't see it.
 

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.920
It was only used inside the
podium.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.000
The reason it was used inside
the podium is concrete is very

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.469
strong.
 

00:54:10.469 --> 00:54:14.217
It can sustain great weight and
the Romans recognized very early

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:17.786
on that they could use it in
utilitarian ways to help support

00:54:17.786 --> 00:54:18.619
buildings.
 

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:24.132
At this particular time the
concrete was made up of rubble

00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:29.840
and liquid mortar and a kind of
a dash of volcanic dust,

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.246
and they brought all of that
together to create a material

00:54:33.246 --> 00:54:35.280
that could sustain great weight.
 

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.139
So they used it here for
utilitarian purposes.

00:54:37.139 --> 00:54:41.262
But we're going to see already
next Tuesday the Romans

00:54:41.262 --> 00:54:45.773
beginning to take advantage of
concrete for very expressive

00:54:45.773 --> 00:54:48.541
purposes --
and how well they do it --

00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:52.501
which culminates ultimately,
obviously, in buildings like

00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:55.369
the Pantheon and its incredible
dome.

00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:59.501
Here's a detail of the Ionic
capitals of the Temple of

00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:00.360
Portunus.
 

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.454
You can also see this building
has, as it would have if it were

00:55:03.454 --> 00:55:05.849
made in Greece,
what's called an Ionic frieze;

00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:07.927
an Ionic frieze,
which if you look very

00:55:07.927 --> 00:55:10.530
carefully,
there's some remains of the

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.800
candelabra and the garlands that
hung from those candelabra in

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.460
the original design of this
temple.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.610
I also think it's interesting
to look--here's a view again of

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.869
the Temple of Portunus as it
looks today.

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:26.143
This is a nineteenth-century
painting of the Temple of

00:55:26.143 --> 00:55:28.985
Portunus, as it looked at the
time it was done,

00:55:28.985 --> 00:55:30.159
by that artist.
 

00:55:30.159 --> 00:55:33.525
And what you see is something
that I have already alluded to,

00:55:33.525 --> 00:55:36.443
but which is extremely
important for the preservation

00:55:36.443 --> 00:55:37.960
of buildings like this.
 

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.190
And that is that this building,
the Temple of Portunus,

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:44.436
like so many in Rome,
was reused in later times and

00:55:44.436 --> 00:55:48.288
transformed into something else,
and it is probably only because

00:55:48.288 --> 00:55:50.681
it was transformed into
something else that it's

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:52.210
survived as well as it did.
 

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:55.101
Because you can see that what
happened is that they walled in

00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:55.679
the front.
 

00:55:55.679 --> 00:55:58.460
They gave it a real
façade,

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:03.030
a doorway, three windows,
a medallion with the Madonna,

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.034
a cross, at the top,
a bell tower,

00:56:05.034 --> 00:56:07.159
and they turned it into a
church.

00:56:07.159 --> 00:56:11.340
And because it was an active
church it was kept in good

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:11.960
shape.
 

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.536
You can see those Ionic
capitals and the frieze with the

00:56:15.536 --> 00:56:18.659
garlands and so on,
of the Temple of Portunus.

00:56:18.659 --> 00:56:21.047
And you can also see the Round
Temple, by the way,

00:56:21.047 --> 00:56:23.630
which still does stand also,
over here, right near it,

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:24.849
near the Tiber River.
 

00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:28.072
So this is the reason that we
are fortunate that the Temple of

00:56:28.072 --> 00:56:29.130
Portunus survives.
 

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.201
And it does survive,
in large part,

00:56:31.201 --> 00:56:34.125
because again it was
transformed into a church in

00:56:34.125 --> 00:56:35.099
later times.
 

00:56:35.099 --> 00:56:36.842
And this is one of the
fascinations of Rome,

00:56:36.842 --> 00:56:39.036
by the way;
you never know--so many

00:56:39.036 --> 00:56:41.429
churches mask earlier buildings.
 

00:56:41.429 --> 00:56:44.590
There's one right near,
not too far from these,

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:48.521
where you can actually see
three Roman temples that stood

00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:52.876
side by side were incorporated
into the Church of San Nicolo in

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:53.719
Carcere.
 

00:56:53.719 --> 00:56:57.356
And you can actually see the
remains of all three of those

00:56:57.356 --> 00:56:59.268
temples used in that church.
 

00:56:59.268 --> 00:57:01.092
And it's one of the
fascinations,

00:57:01.092 --> 00:57:03.940
obviously, of wandering around
the city of Rome.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:08.469
The other two temples that I
want to show you today--

00:57:08.469 --> 00:57:11.719
we're looking back at the map
of this particular area--

00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:15.068
are located at Cori,
and you can see the proximity

00:57:15.068 --> 00:57:16.748
of Cori,
not just to Rome,

00:57:16.748 --> 00:57:19.309
but also to Ostia,
right here.

00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:21.960
The city of Cori and the city
of Tivoli.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.949
And now you see Tivoli from
where travertine comes;

00:57:24.949 --> 00:57:28.530
the location of Tivoli in
relationship again to Rome.

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:31.168
It's not very far,
which is why the building

00:57:31.168 --> 00:57:34.237
material was so easily
transportable from Tivoli to

00:57:34.237 --> 00:57:34.789
Rome.
 

00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:36.599
Let's look first at Cori.
 

00:57:36.599 --> 00:57:41.072
Cori is one of those
incredibly--those of you who

00:57:41.072 --> 00:57:44.695
have traveled around Italy,
outside of Rome,

00:57:44.695 --> 00:57:46.965
around Italy,
know that one of the glories of

00:57:46.965 --> 00:57:50.012
traveling in Italy is to go into
some of these medieval hill

00:57:50.012 --> 00:57:50.579
towns.
 

00:57:50.579 --> 00:57:54.954
You go into these places and
you--whether by car or by bus or

00:57:54.954 --> 00:57:59.550
cab--you make your way up to the
very peak of that hill town.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:02.273
It's very picturesque,
and then ultimately you get to

00:58:02.273 --> 00:58:05.260
the top and you stand up there
and you get this incredible

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.880
panorama over the city and over
the landscape.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.869
That's the kind of place Cori
is.

00:58:09.869 --> 00:58:11.389
It's a medieval hill town.
 

00:58:11.389 --> 00:58:15.168
But leave it to the Romans--and
they had a knack for doing this

00:58:15.168 --> 00:58:18.762
wherever they went--they found
the best location in Cori for

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:19.800
their temple.
 

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.454
And this temple is located
almost at the very peak of the

00:58:23.454 --> 00:58:26.052
hill of Cori,
and you have to drive all the

00:58:26.052 --> 00:58:29.070
way up to see the temple,
the so-called Temple of

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.300
Hercules at Cori.
 

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.262
We don't really know if this
was put up to Hercules,

00:58:32.262 --> 00:58:34.650
but it's been called the Temple
of Hercules for a long time.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:36.460
So we continue to call it that.
 

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.586
And you see it here in plan,
in restored view,

00:58:39.586 --> 00:58:43.617
with its little complex in
front, and then the temple as it

00:58:43.617 --> 00:58:44.730
looks today.
 

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.291
So looking at this one,
then we can see again that we

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:52.335
are dealing with an Etruscan
plan, with freestanding columns

00:58:52.335 --> 00:58:53.500
in the porch.
 

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.010
You can't see it here,
but you can up there.

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.000
It does have a single staircase.
 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.659
It's a kind of pyramidal
staircase.

00:58:59.659 --> 00:59:02.317
It has a side as well as a
front -- or sides as well as

00:59:02.317 --> 00:59:02.760
fronts.
 

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.851
But you can see it does not go
all the way around,

00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:09.690
as a Greek staircase would
have.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.969
It's focused on the front.
 

00:59:10.969 --> 00:59:14.021
So we once again have this idea
of single staircase on the

00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:15.960
front;
façade orientation of

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.630
the temple;
deep porch;

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.170
freestanding columns in that
porch;

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:21.010
single cella, in this case.
 

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:23.840
Now, Neil, what happens when
you go around in this one?

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.199
Student: Is that for
this one?

00:59:26.199 --> 00:59:27.719
Prof: Yes.
 

00:59:27.719 --> 00:59:29.860
Student:  Well there's
no columns around on this one.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.661
Prof: There are no
columns.

00:59:30.661 --> 00:59:31.219
There are no columns.
 

00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:32.670
It's not a peripteral colonnade.
 

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:36.036
It's not a pseudo-peripteral
because it doesn't have--but

00:59:36.036 --> 00:59:36.940
what is this?
 

00:59:40.889 --> 00:59:42.039
They look sort of like flat
columns.

00:59:42.039 --> 00:59:45.923
They're what are called
pilasters, p-i-l-a-s-t-e-r-s,

00:59:45.923 --> 00:59:49.510
pilasters, which are
essentially flat columns.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.461
So it does have some
articulation--you can see them

00:59:52.461 --> 00:59:55.947
up there--there is articulation,
but it's been flattened out

00:59:55.947 --> 00:59:57.010
still further.
 

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:59.608
So once again an Etruscan plan
with some nod to Greece,

00:59:59.608 --> 01:00:02.447
in the sense that there's a
recognition -- we've got to have

01:00:02.447 --> 01:00:04.179
something that goes around here.
 

01:00:04.179 --> 01:00:07.788
But, they don't want to take it
out, they don't want to use an

01:00:07.788 --> 01:00:10.036
actual column,
and they flatten it out,

01:00:10.036 --> 01:00:11.929
as you can see so well here.
 

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:14.992
Now again, anyone who knows
your orders, what Greek order is

01:00:14.992 --> 01:00:16.500
used here in this building?
 

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:16.769
Yes?
 

01:00:16.769 --> 01:00:17.889
Student:  Doric.
 

01:00:17.889 --> 01:00:19.018
Prof: The Doric,
the Doric order.

01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:22.512
The simplest and most severe
order is used here,

01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:25.856
the Greek Doric order,
and the system of Greek

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.849
triglyphs and metopes;
triglyphs and metopes.

01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:31.485
I'll show you a detail in a
moment and I'll explain what

01:00:31.485 --> 01:00:32.059
those are.
 

01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:34.893
So the Greek Doric order,
triglyphs and metopes,

01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:35.980
for this temple.
 

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.090
And one thing we couldn't see
in that plan is the high podium.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:42.530
So that's another Etruscan
feature.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:46.983
So once again we see this very
interesting and very eclectic

01:00:46.983 --> 01:00:51.438
bringing together of Etruscan
elements and Greek elements in

01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:55.440
what we can call early Roman
temple architecture.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.869
Here's another detail of the
Temple at Cori.

01:00:57.869 --> 01:01:01.773
You can get a--I took this on a
very grey day so you don't get

01:01:01.773 --> 01:01:05.550
the sense of the glory of what
it can look like up there.

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:07.860
But you get some sense of its
situation,

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.889
right at the edge,
with a spectacular--

01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:14.635
on a beautiful day--a
spectacular panorama of the

01:01:14.635 --> 01:01:16.838
mountains,
the other mountains in this

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.730
area, and of the hill town
itself.

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:21.090
And here we can see the Doric
order better;

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.800
very simple,
with the so-called triglyphs

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.572
and metopes;
t-r-i-g-l-y-p-h and

01:01:26.572 --> 01:01:30.219
m-e-t-o-p-e-s,
triglyphs and metopes.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:33.150
Triglyphs are triple striated
bands.

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:36.516
And you can see them up there,
the triple striated bands,

01:01:36.516 --> 01:01:38.679
and in between them square
panels.

01:01:38.679 --> 01:01:41.380
So this alteration of triple
striated bands,

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.710
the triglyphs,
and the square panels,

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:47.956
the metopes,
which is typical of the Doric

01:01:47.956 --> 01:01:49.960
order,
the Greek Doric order.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.141
You see it in the Parthenon,
for example,

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.760
and it has been taken over here
by the Romans.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.577
You also see something very
interesting about Roman building

01:01:57.577 --> 01:01:59.242
practice here,
because if you look at the

01:01:59.242 --> 01:02:01.016
columns,
you'll see that the upper part

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:03.090
of the columns are what is
called fluted,

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.768
fluted -- they have striations
in them.

01:02:05.768 --> 01:02:08.889
But they're not fluted at the
bottom.

01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:12.144
You can see it stops right
here, the fluting stops here and

01:02:12.144 --> 01:02:13.380
the bottom is plain.
 

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.030
What's the reason for that?
 

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:18.335
Well we know that even in Greek
Hellenistic times,

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:21.980
that approach was taken,
and we believe it was done for

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.059
two reasons.
 

01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:24.099
One: practical purposes.
 

01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:27.440
Why are there no flutes at the
bottom?

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.059
Because people are more likely
to lean up against the columns,

01:02:31.059 --> 01:02:33.086
at the bottom,
than they are obviously at the

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:34.936
top,
and when people lean up against

01:02:34.936 --> 01:02:37.530
columns,
the flutes start to break off.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.789
So they decided not to flute
the bottom.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.940
But it may have been also for
decorative reasons,

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.090
because we'll see,
when we get to Pompeii,

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.914
in the very near future,
that there are many columns at

01:02:47.914 --> 01:02:50.750
Pompeii that have fluting at the
top,

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.039
painted white,
and then the bottom,

01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:54.554
the plain bottom,
painted red,

01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:56.539
for reasons of taste and
decoration.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:59.989
And it's very possible--we do
know that ancient--

01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:01.980
I don't want to destroy any
illusions here--

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.849
but ancient buildings were very
often painted,

01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:07.010
and ancient sculpture was
always painted.

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.456
So these might've been a lot
more garish looking in ancient

01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:13.367
times than they are today,
which might also have taken

01:03:13.367 --> 01:03:15.570
away from this sense of having a
marble building.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.737
So that's something that we
probably should keep in mind as

01:03:18.737 --> 01:03:20.429
we evaluate these structures.
 

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:24.838
The last one I want to show you
today is the Temple of Vesta at

01:03:24.838 --> 01:03:27.539
Tivoli -- also beautifully
situated.

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:30.349
It's a temple that dates to 80
B.C.

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:33.085
Also probably not a Temple of
Vesta, but it's a round temple,

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.909
and temples of Vesta were often
round.

01:03:34.909 --> 01:03:39.030
So it's tended to be called by
scholars a Temple of Vesta -- in

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:39.630
80 B.C.
 

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:44.635
Again, beautifully situated out
over a particularly verdant area

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:49.324
of Tivoli, where you can look
down and around this beautiful

01:03:49.324 --> 01:03:50.039
area.
 

01:03:50.039 --> 01:03:51.780
There's a waterfall very nearby.
 

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.552
It's just magnificent,
and you can see it's not

01:03:54.552 --> 01:03:57.567
surprising that some
enterprising family decided to

01:03:57.567 --> 01:04:00.280
build the Sybilla Restaurant
right here,

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.056
and there's a patio on which
one can go and eat under

01:04:04.056 --> 01:04:07.090
umbrellas,
and so on and so forth, here.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.329
Here's the temple,
the ancient temple of 80 B.C.

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:13.110
And once again we look at a
plan over here.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:16.873
And I also show you a view of
the so-called Temple of Venus

01:04:16.873 --> 01:04:21.143
from Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,
just to make the point that

01:04:21.143 --> 01:04:24.510
this is as Greek as we've gotten
thus far,

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.800
in the sense that the Greeks
really loved round temples.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.659
They built them a lot.
 

01:04:28.659 --> 01:04:30.789
There was a very famous Temple
of Venus,

01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:34.900
in their case Aphrodite,
on the island of Knidos,

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.637
and that Temple of Venus on the
island of Knidos is the one that

01:04:38.637 --> 01:04:41.130
was duplicated by Hadrian for
his villa;

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.960
and we'll talk about this later
in the semester.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.663
But I show the one at Hadrian's
villa because it gives you a

01:04:45.663 --> 01:04:48.273
very good sense of what this
structure was like in ancient

01:04:48.273 --> 01:04:50.929
Greek times as well,
because we think it's a replica.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:54.262
A round structure;
freestanding columns encircling

01:04:54.262 --> 01:04:57.914
the entire building,
low podium, a staircase around

01:04:57.914 --> 01:05:01.469
that podium that encircled the
entire building,

01:05:01.469 --> 01:05:03.610
and then a Temple of Venus in
the center.

01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:06.907
When we look at the plan of
this structure we will see it's

01:05:06.907 --> 01:05:07.760
pretty close.
 

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.750
It's round.
 

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:11.056
It has columns that are
freestanding,

01:05:11.056 --> 01:05:13.429
that encircle the entire
structure.

01:05:13.429 --> 01:05:18.380
But it has a higher podium,
as we're going to see,

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.456
and even though it's circular,
they've given it a staircase on

01:05:22.456 --> 01:05:25.333
one side,
which gives it--even a round

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.201
temple,
which you think of as something

01:05:27.201 --> 01:05:29.887
you just keep circling,
has a kind of façade

01:05:29.887 --> 01:05:32.139
orientation,
in this instance.

01:05:32.139 --> 01:05:36.974
So they are applying some of
these Etruscan characteristics

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.559
to an almost pure Greek type.
 

01:05:39.559 --> 01:05:41.853
Here's a view,
it's very well preserved,

01:05:41.853 --> 01:05:45.440
a view of the Temple of Vesta
at Tivoli, as it looks today.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.349
And what order is this?
 

01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:49.639
Student:  Corinthian.
 

01:05:49.639 --> 01:05:50.760
Prof: The Corinthian
order;

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.125
the Corinthian,
the last of the three great

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:53.969
Greek orders.
 

01:05:53.969 --> 01:05:56.429
The Corinthian order,
which is very ornate and which

01:05:56.429 --> 01:05:57.780
I'll describe in a moment.
 

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.746
We see it here,
supporting a frieze once again,

01:06:00.746 --> 01:06:04.489
in this case a frieze with
garlands and libation dishes.

01:06:04.489 --> 01:06:07.719
We can see here also it is a
very tall podium;

01:06:07.719 --> 01:06:11.260
so an imposition of an Etruscan
element on this structure.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.849
Greek orders.
 

01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:15.880
The building is made out of
stone.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:21.297
The columns and the facing of
the base are made out of stone,

01:06:21.297 --> 01:06:24.639
in this case travertine once
again.

01:06:24.639 --> 01:06:27.110
Travertine again was quarried
right next door -- this is

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:28.099
Tivoli, right there.
 

01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:32.340
And you can see the travertine
detailing on the doorway and on

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.869
the windows as well.
 

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:36.659
But what you see here that we
haven't seen before--

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:41.340
remember I talked about the use
of concrete in the podium of the

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:45.248
Temple of Portunus in Rome--
here we see concrete used for

01:06:45.248 --> 01:06:46.579
the wall of the cella.
 

01:06:46.579 --> 01:06:48.599
If the Greeks had put up this
building,

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:51.824
they would've made the walls of
the cella out of stone and they

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:54.998
would've cut those stones very
carefully to create the kind of

01:06:54.998 --> 01:06:56.559
curvature that was needed.
 

01:06:56.559 --> 01:06:58.288
But the Romans were getting
really smart,

01:06:58.288 --> 01:07:00.449
in terms of making things
easier for themselves.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:03.880
They realized it was going to
be a lot easier to build a round

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.309
structure with concrete than it
was to have to carve all those

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:09.110
stones in just those shapes.
 

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:12.840
So they have used concrete here
for the cella.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.860
We still could argue this is a
utilitarian purpose,

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.827
but at the same time I think
it's beginning to demonstrate to

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.869
us the expressive possibilities
of concrete.

01:07:22.869 --> 01:07:25.050
And we also see,
if you look very carefully,

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:28.849
the way in which--we'll talk
much more about this next week--

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:31.615
but concrete,
in order to make concrete

01:07:31.615 --> 01:07:34.820
impermeable to water and so and
so forth,

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.130
you have to face it with
something.

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:39.670
And they faced it with very
small stones of irregular shape,

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:43.030
which we call uncertain work,
or opus incertum,

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:48.010
-o-p-u-s i-n-c-e-r-t-u-m,
opus incertum,

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:51.380
which is put into the concrete
while it is still wet,

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.619
to give it the ability to
withstand water but also to give

01:07:55.619 --> 01:07:58.670
it an attractive stone-like
appearance.

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:02.329
And you can see that opus
incertum work used here.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:06.813
Here's a detail of the wall,
where you can see its curvature

01:08:06.813 --> 01:08:10.309
and also see that opus
incertum work.

01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:13.186
And here is a detail of the
capitals, the Corinthian

01:08:13.186 --> 01:08:14.880
capitals that are used here.
 

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.018
What's characteristic of
Corinthian capitals is that they

01:08:19.018 --> 01:08:21.002
have,
like the Ionic,

01:08:21.002 --> 01:08:24.899
they have volutes,
these spiral volutes,

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:29.319
but they are much smaller and
much more delicate,

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:33.238
and they are in a sense
incorporated into the flowering

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:33.819
plant.
 

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:37.960
This is called an acanthus
plant, a-c-a-n-t-h-u-s.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.560
Acanthus plants grow all over
Italy.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.779
You see them everywhere.
 

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:45.898
So they are just copying a
plant that is indigenous to

01:08:45.898 --> 01:08:46.520
Italy.
 

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.990
They use those acanthus leaves,
that seem to grow out of the

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:52.877
column,
to incorporate the spirals,

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:58.153
and there's always a prominent
central flower that is also part

01:08:58.153 --> 01:08:59.600
of this motif.
 

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.510
It's important to note,
at the beginning,

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:05.381
that while the Greeks used the
Doric and the Ionic order almost

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:07.837
exclusively,
the Greeks did invent the

01:09:07.837 --> 01:09:08.930
Corinthian order.
 

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.047
They used it in very late
Hellenistic times,

01:09:11.047 --> 01:09:12.279
but quite infrequently.
 

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:16.828
The Romans use all three but we
are going to see very quickly

01:09:16.828 --> 01:09:21.529
that they decide pretty early on
that the Corinthian capital is

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.648
their capital,
and almost every

01:09:23.648 --> 01:09:25.260
building--we'll see some
exceptions--

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.307
but almost every building we'll
see in the course of the

01:09:28.307 --> 01:09:30.470
semester uses the Corinthian
capital.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.502
Why did they take to the
Corinthian capital in

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.090
particular?
 

01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:35.975
This is something we can think
about in the course of this

01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:37.090
semester and debate.
 

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.399
I think it has to do probably
with two major reasons.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.632
One: it was particularly
decorative, very highly

01:09:41.632 --> 01:09:43.439
decorative, more so than the
others.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.979
But maybe even more important
than that is the fact that the

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.586
Corinthian capital,
at least in my opinion,

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:52.158
looks the best from the most
vantage points,

01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:54.470
because it's pretty much the
same all the way around.

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.800
The Doric is pretty severe.
 

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.860
The Ionic looks best from
certain angles where you can

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.270
really see the volutes well,
less well from other angles.

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:05.760
But this looks pretty much the
same wherever you see it.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.529
So it's a very flexible and
easy to use capital type.

01:10:11.529 --> 01:10:14.234
We see also here--I referred to
this last time but I want to

01:10:14.234 --> 01:10:16.069
describe it for you just in a
second--

01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:21.470
we see here the coffering,
c-o-f-f-e-r-i-n-g,

01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:26.001
the coffering of the ceiling,
which is basically placing a

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:29.500
series of receding square
elements there,

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:34.130
to give a sense of depth in the
ceiling.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.103
And then in the center you see
these flowers that match up

01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:39.398
nicely with those in the
Corinthian capitals,

01:10:39.398 --> 01:10:41.850
which are called rosettes,
r-o-s-e-t-t-e-s;

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:44.993
and we'll see coffering and the
use of rosettes quite

01:10:44.993 --> 01:10:47.170
extensively in Roman
architecture.

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:48.350
I mentioned the restaurant.
 

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:51.710
The Sybilla used to be a
horrendous restaurant.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.864
When I started taking pictures
of Roman buildings I guess I was

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:56.800
a little more timid than I am
today.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.020
So I always thought,
"Well gee,

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.948
if I'm going to go into the
terrace and want to take a

01:10:59.948 --> 01:11:01.829
picture of the temple,
I'm kind of going to have to

01:11:01.829 --> 01:11:02.420
eat there."
 

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.730
I would never do that now,
but I did that at one point,

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:07.170
and I made the mistake of
eating in this restaurant twice,

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:08.538
and I never went back again.
 

01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:11.155
But when I went just a couple
of years ago to see the temple

01:11:11.155 --> 01:11:13.773
once again, I saw that they had
really--some new owners must

01:11:13.773 --> 01:11:14.658
have come along.
 

01:11:14.658 --> 01:11:17.240
They've really expanded the
restaurant and it looks very

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.010
pretty now, and this is the
terrace on which one can eat.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.750
I haven't tried it but I might
actually, next time I go.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:27.149
I want to just end with a
couple of remarks.

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:31.180
One is that one of the
interesting things is that,

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.823
although the temples that we
talked about today were in part

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:38.113
made out of stone,
in all cases travertine,

01:11:38.113 --> 01:11:42.020
we do know that already in the
year 146 B.C.--

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.340
so earlier than a couple of the
temples we looked at just now--

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.420
in 146 B.C.
 

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.420
the Romans had already put up
another temple to Jupiter,

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.765
near the Tiber River,
that was made entirely of

01:11:54.765 --> 01:11:57.020
marble, entirely of marble.
 

01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.728
So they were already beginning
to think, not just of their own

01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:04.255
local stone or stones that were
from local, close places in

01:12:04.255 --> 01:12:06.140
Italy, but imported marble.
 

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.914
And so I want you to know that
so that we can talk about it in

01:12:09.914 --> 01:12:10.720
the future.
 

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.778
And we also know that in 142,
the ceiling of the Temple of

01:12:14.778 --> 01:12:18.860
Jupiter OMC was gilded,
and we also know that not long

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:23.175
after that they re-paved the
Temple of Jupiter OMC and gave

01:12:23.175 --> 01:12:25.109
it multi-colored stone.
 

01:12:25.109 --> 01:12:28.908
So what this is telling us is a
lot of people in Rome were

01:12:28.908 --> 01:12:32.573
beginning to think of temples
that were more ornate than

01:12:32.573 --> 01:12:34.840
anything that had come before.
 

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.529
There are some very
conservative individuals,

01:12:38.529 --> 01:12:40.930
who did some writing at this
particular time,

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:44.548
who bemoaned the fact that the
Romans had moved away from the

01:12:44.548 --> 01:12:48.229
Etruscan temples made out of
wood and mud-brick and so on,

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:51.279
and were becoming too
ostentatious in their taste.

01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:54.332
But I think these new Greek
style temples were definitely

01:12:54.332 --> 01:12:55.149
here to stay.
 

01:12:55.149 --> 01:12:58.920
And I just wanted to end up
with a quote from Cicero.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.128
After one of these fires,
these fires that so often raged

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:05.154
in Rome,
the Great Fire of 83 B.C.,

01:13:05.154 --> 01:13:08.470
Cicero talks about the
rebuilding,

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:11.448
still again,
of the Temple of Jupiter OMC.

01:13:11.448 --> 01:13:15.243
And I quote from Cicero when he
says: "Let us feel that

01:13:15.243 --> 01:13:19.100
conflagration to have been the
will of heaven and its purpose

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.380
not to destroy the temple of
Almighty Jupiter,

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:27.659
but to demand of us one more
splendid and magnificent."

01:13:27.659 --> 01:13:28.560
What did that mean?
 

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.738
More Greek, more Greek-looking,
more marble.

01:13:31.738 --> 01:13:35.685
And--the last comment I'm going
to make is--to make the Temple

01:13:35.685 --> 01:13:38.210
of Jupiter OMC even more
magnificent.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.323
The Roman general Sulla,
who was sacking Athens at this

01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:43.858
particular time,
goes into Athens,

01:13:43.858 --> 01:13:46.716
and after he sacks it,
takes it over,

01:13:46.716 --> 01:13:48.899
conquers it,
he goes up to the biggest

01:13:48.899 --> 01:13:51.418
temple in town,
the Temple of Olympian

01:13:51.418 --> 01:13:54.408
Zeus--Zeus, the Greek
counterpart of Jupiter--

01:13:54.408 --> 01:13:58.349
and he takes some of the
columns, actually steals some of

01:13:58.349 --> 01:14:02.509
the columns from that temple,
has them shipped back to Rome,

01:14:02.509 --> 01:14:06.199
and he incorporates them into
the Temple of Jupiter OMC,

01:14:06.199 --> 01:14:07.680
on the Capitoline Hill.
 

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.779
These columns--my last
point--these columns were

01:14:11.779 --> 01:14:16.577
fifty-five and one-half feet
tall, and they were made of

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.060
solid marble.
 

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.797
So that gives you some sense of
the objectives of the Romans

01:14:21.797 --> 01:14:25.600
vis-à-vis temple building
in the first century B.C.

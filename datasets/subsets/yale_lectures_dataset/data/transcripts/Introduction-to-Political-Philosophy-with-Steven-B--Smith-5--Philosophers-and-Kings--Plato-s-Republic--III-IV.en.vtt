00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.434
Professor Steven Smith:
Today Republic,

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:06.330
Act 2.
And what I want to do is

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.412
continue with the account of the
various figures,

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:16.888
various persons who populate,
who inhabit this dialogue,

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:19.861
and who they are,
what they represent,

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.601
and how they contribute to the
argument and the structure of

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.622
the work as a whole.
Last time, and I won't repeat

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:32.230
this, last time we talked
briefly at the end of class

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.922
about Cephalus,
and Socrates' treatment of

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:41.182
Cephalus, the embodiment of
convention, the embodiment of

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:47.006
Athenian opinion in the way in
which Socrates as it were chases

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:52.310
Cephalus out of the dialogue,
out of the conversation.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.633
We never hear from him again.
And the speakers are able,

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:01.791
presumably, to pursue the
audacious arguments that will

00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:07.331
appear in the rest of the book
without the oversight of the

00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:12.140
head of the household,
the embodiment of conventional

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.273
opinion.
And Socrates next pursues this

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:21.813
discussion with the son of
Cephalus, Polemarchus,

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:28.739
the man who first had Socrates
approached on the Piraeus.

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:33.168
Polemarchus is described as the
heir of the argument as well as

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:36.739
the, to be sure,
the heir of the family fortune.

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:42.730
Polemarchus is what the Greeks
would call a "gentlemen."

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.173
Let us just say he is a person
willing to stand up for and

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:52.722
defend his family and friends.
I don't mean necessarily by a

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:55.400
"gentlemen" somebody who holds
the door for others,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.204
or so on, but somebody who
stands up for his family and

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:05.367
friends in the way that he does.
Unlike his father however,

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:09.641
Polemarchus shows himself
concerned not just with the

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:13.340
needs of the body as Cephalus
represented,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.776
but Polemarchus is concerned to
defend the honor and safety of

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:22.477
the polis.
He accepts the view that

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:27.580
justice is giving to each what
is owed, but he interprets this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.934
to mean that justice means doing
good to your friends and harm to

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.673
your enemies.
Justice, we might say,

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:41.952
is a kind of loyalty,
it is a kind of loyalty that we

00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:47.557
feel to members of a family,
to members of our team,

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:52.152
to fellow students of a
residential college,

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:58.778
and the kind of loyalty we feel
to a place like Yale as opposed

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:02.821
to all other places.
That is to say,

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:08.581
Polemarchus understands justice
as a kind of patriotic sentiment

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:14.158
that citizens of one city or one
polis feel for one another in

00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:19.588
opposition to all other places.
Justice is devotion to one's

00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:22.531
own.
And one's own is the good for

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:23.680
Polemarchus.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.241
One's own is the just.
But Socrates challenges

00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:35.287
Polemarchus on the grounds that
loyalty to a group,

00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:39.173
any group,
cannot be a virtue in itself,

00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:45.039
and he trips Polemarchus up
with a very, in many ways,

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.770
familiar Socratic argument "Do
we ever make mistakes?"

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.132
he asks Polemarchus.
"Isn't the distinction between

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:59.960
friend and enemy based on a kind
of knowledge,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.319
on a perception of who is your
friend and who is your enemy?

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.400
Have we ever mistaken a friend
for enemy?"

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.770
The answer seems to be,
"Of course we have."

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.293
We all know people who we
thought to be our friends but we

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:21.420
found out that they were talking
behind our backs,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.006
or that they were operating to
deceive us in some way or

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:28.948
another.
Of course, it's happened to

00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:31.937
everyone.
"So how can we say that justice

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:36.139
means helping friends and
harming enemies," Socrates asks,

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.742
"when we may not even be sure
who our friends and our enemies

00:04:40.742 --> 00:04:44.000
really are?
Why should citizens of one

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.566
state, namely one's own have any
moral priority over the citizens

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:54.112
of another state when,
again, we don't know them and

00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:59.184
we may well be mistaken in our
assumption that they are enemies

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:03.123
or friends?
Isn't, in other words such an

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:09.287
unreflective attachment to one's
own bound to result in injustice

00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:13.003
to others?
Socrates seems to be asking

00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:16.395
Polemarchus.
Once again, in many ways,

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:21.160
we see Socrates dissolving the
bonds of the familiar.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.984
At no other point in the
Republic,

00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:27.373
I think, do we see so clearly
the tension between

00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:31.539
philosophical reflectiveness on
the one hand in the sense of

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.942
camaraderie,
mutuality and esprit de

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:39.290
corps necessary for
political life on the other.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.055
Socrates seems to dissolve
those bonds of familiarity,

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:48.641
loyalty and attachment that we
all have by saying to

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.500
Polemarchus,
"How do we know,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.382
how do we really know the
distinction between friend and

00:05:56.382 --> 00:05:59.172
enemy?"
But Polemarchus seems to

00:05:59.172 --> 00:06:04.086
believe that a city can survive
only with a vivid sense of what

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:06.495
it is.
Of what we might say,

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:10.369
what it stands for,
and an equally vivid sense of

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.839
what it is not,
and who are its enemies.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:18.089
Isn't this essential for the
survival of any state,

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.980
of any city?
To know who its friends and

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.069
enemies are?
Who its challenges are?

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.010
Socrates' disillusion of that
very framework,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.489
challenges, it seems to me,
the very possibility of

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:38.863
political life by questioning
the question or the distinction

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:43.136
between friend and enemy.
Although Polemarchus,

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.845
like his father,
is reduced to silence,

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:49.480
it is notable that his argument
is not defeated.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.446
Later in the Republic
you will see,

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:56.280
not that much later even,
Socrates will argue that the

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.910
best city may be characterized
by peace and harmony at home,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.290
but this will never be so for
relations between states.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.607
This is why even the best city,
even Kallipolis will require,

00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:13.990
as he spends a great deal of
time discussing,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.750
will require a warrior class,
a class of what he calls

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.128
"auxiliaries."
War and the preparation for war

00:07:24.128 --> 00:07:28.300
is an intrinsic part of even the
most just city.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.815
Even the Platonic just city
will have to cultivate warrior

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:39.621
citizens who are prepared to
risk life in battle for the sake

00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:42.927
of their own city.
So in many ways,

00:07:42.927 --> 00:07:46.754
it seems that Polemarchus'
argument, while apparently

00:07:46.754 --> 00:07:51.629
refuted in Book I,
is rehabilitated and re-emerges

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.709
in its own way later in the
dialogue.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:58.953
And we might want to think
about this because it is an

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:02.381
argument that is very important
to contemporary twentieth

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.930
century--important twentieth-
century political theorist by

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.541
the name of Schmitt who made the
distinction between what he

00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:13.032
called the friend and the enemy,
you remember,

00:08:13.032 --> 00:08:16.720
are central to his
understanding of politics.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.024
This is an argument that comes
from Polemarchus in Book I of

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.630
the Republic.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.629
Polemarchus is dispatched in
one way or another,

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:35.934
and this creates the
opportunity for the longest and

00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:41.240
in many ways most memorable
exchange in Book I,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.766
and perhaps even the
Republic as a whole,

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:48.892
the exchange with Thrasymachus
who represents a far more

00:08:48.892 --> 00:08:53.544
difficult challenge in his own
way than either of the first two

00:08:53.544 --> 00:08:56.087
speakers.
In many ways,

00:08:56.087 --> 00:09:02.522
because Thrasymachus could be
seen as Socrates' alter-ego in

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:09.139
some way, his sort of evil twin.
He is, how to put it?

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:16.509
He is the Doctor Moriarty to
Socrates' Sherlock Holmes.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:20.159
You know, the evil doppelganger
in some way.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.820
Thrasymachus' is a rival of
Socrates in many respects;

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.210
he also like Socrates is a
teacher clearly.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.785
He is an educator.
He claims to have a certain

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:35.409
kind of knowledge of what
justice is, and claims to be

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:37.460
able to teach it to others.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:45.400
He is teaching a kind of,
we will find out,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.686
a kind of hard-headed realism
that expresses disgust at

00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:56.950
Polemarchus' talk about loyalty
and friendship and the like.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:02.318
"Justice," he asserts,
"is the interest of the

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.070
stronger."
Every polity of which we know

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.309
is based upon a distinction
between the rulers and the

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:13.618
ruled.
Justice consists of the rules,

00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:17.328
that is to say,
that are made by and for the

00:10:17.328 --> 00:10:23.317
benefits of the ruling class.
Justice is nothing more or less

00:10:23.317 --> 00:10:29.565
right than what benefits the
rulers, the rulers who determine

00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:33.755
the laws of justice.
Thrasymachus is,

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:40.039
of course even for us today,
a familiar kind of person.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.632
He is the intellectual who
enjoys bringing,

00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:47.482
you might say,
the harsh and unremitting facts

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:53.526
about human nature to light,
who enjoys dispelling illusions

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:58.771
and pretty beliefs.
He's the one who probably would

00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:03.789
be the first to tell you there
is no Santa Claus.

00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:08.000
He is that kind of hard-boiled
realist.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.111
No matter how much we may
dislike him in some ways,

00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:15.730
one has to admit also there
maybe a grain,

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.262
if not more than a grain of
truth in what he seems to be

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.431
saying.
And what he seems to be saying

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:27.699
is this: we are beings who are
first and foremost dominated by

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:32.251
a desire for power.
This is what distinguishes,

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:34.902
you might say,
the true man,

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:39.026
the real man,
the alpha male you might say,

00:11:39.026 --> 00:11:43.976
from the slave.
Power and domination are all we

00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:47.740
truly care about.
And when we get later in this

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.240
semester to Thomas Hobbes,
remember Thrasymachus.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.566
I'll just say that for now.
Remember Thrasymachus when we

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:57.330
get to Hobbes.
Power and domination are all we

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.653
care about.
And what is true of individuals

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:05.525
is also true for collective
entities, collective nouns like

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:10.367
states and cities.
Every polity seeks its own

00:12:10.367 --> 00:12:16.996
advantage against others,
making relations between states

00:12:16.996 --> 00:12:23.269
a condition of unremitting war
of all against all.

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:26.668
In the language,
if I can switch to the language

00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:29.705
of modern economics,
one could say that for

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:32.960
Thrasymachus politics is a
zero-sum game.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.371
There are winners and there are
losers, and the more someone

00:12:37.371 --> 00:12:41.110
wins that means the more someone
else will lose.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.063
And the rules of justice are
simply the laws set up by the

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:48.808
winners of the game to protect
and to promote their own

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:49.780
interests.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.753
It didn't take Karl Marx to
invent, or to discover that

00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:03.391
insight, that the rules of
justice are simply the rules of

00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:07.743
the ruling class.
That comes straight out of

00:13:07.743 --> 00:13:12.320
Thrasymachus,
Book I of the Republic.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.678
Well, how to respond?
And again, Socrates challenges

00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:22.481
Thrasymachus with a variation of
the argument that he used

00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:26.398
against Polemarchus.
That is to say "Do we ever make

00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:28.359
mistakes?"
That is to say,

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:32.894
it is not self-evident,
or it is not always intuitively

00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:37.657
obvious what our interests are.
If justice is truly in the

00:13:37.657 --> 00:13:41.766
interests of the stronger,
doesn't that require some kind

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:45.360
of knowledge,
some kind of reflection on the

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.957
part of those in power to know
what is really and truly in

00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:54.580
their interest?
People make mistakes and it is

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:00.710
very possible to make a mistake
about your own interests.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.634
And of course,
Thrasymachus has to acknowledge

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:06.429
this, of course the rulers make
mistakes,

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.996
and he tries to invent an
argument that if a ruler makes a

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:12.500
mistake, he's not really a true
ruler.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.891
The true ruler is the person
who both acts on his own

00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:21.620
interest and of course knows
what those interests are.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.889
But the point that he admits is
all, in a sense,

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:28.653
that Socrates needs;
justice is not power alone,

00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:33.559
justice requires knowledge.
Justice requires reflection.

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:37.277
And that is of course at the
core of the famous Socratic

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:40.590
thesis, that all virtue is a
form of knowledge,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.879
all the virtues require
knowledge and reflection at

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:49.458
their basis.
But much of the exchange with

00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:52.933
Thrasymachus turns on the
problem of what kind of

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:56.624
knowledge justice involves,
and justice is a kind of

00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:59.608
knowledge.
If justice equals self-interest

00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:02.914
and self-interest requires
knowledge, well what kind of

00:15:02.914 --> 00:15:06.467
knowledge is that?
Thrasymachus contends that

00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:11.614
justice consists of the art of
convincing people to obey the

00:15:11.614 --> 00:15:16.150
rules that are really in the
interests of others,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.977
the interests of their rulers.
Justice, in other words,

00:15:19.977 --> 00:15:24.210
for Thrasymachus is a kind of
sucker's game;

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:30.604
obeying the rules that really
benefit others largely because

00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:34.940
we fear the consequences of
injustice.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.080
Justice is really something
only respected by the weak who

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.320
are fearful of the consequences
of injustice.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.492
Again, the true ruler,
in some ways,

00:15:47.492 --> 00:15:52.568
is one, Thrasymachus believes,
who has the courage to act

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:58.214
unjustly for his own interest.
"The true ruler," he says "is

00:15:58.214 --> 00:16:03.520
one who is like a shepherd with
a flock, but he rules not for

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.930
the benefit of the flock but,
of course, for his own

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.659
interests, the good of the
shepherd."

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:15.090
Justice, like all knowledge,
is really a form,

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.375
again, of self-interest.
And so one can ask,

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:23.100
"Is Thrasymachus wrong to
believe this?"

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.796
And I realize I'm moving over
this very quickly,

00:16:25.796 --> 00:16:28.320
but is Thrasymachus wrong to
believe that?

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.835
Socrates wins the argument in
Book I with a kind of,

00:16:32.835 --> 00:16:36.200
you might even say,
sleight of hand.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.942
Both he and Thrasymachus
believe that justice is a

00:16:39.942 --> 00:16:44.143
virtue, but Socrates says,
"What kind of virtue is it to

00:16:44.143 --> 00:16:46.970
deceive and fleece other
people?"

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:52.092
Thrasymachus is forced to admit
that the just person is a fool,

00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:56.471
Thrasymachus believes,
is a fool for obeying laws that

00:16:56.471 --> 00:17:00.421
are not beneficial to him.
But the best life,

00:17:00.421 --> 00:17:04.589
Thrasymachus believes,
it doing maximum injustice to

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:09.467
others, doing whatever you like.
And with that realization,

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:14.201
we see a very dramatic moment
in Book I, even in the book as a

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.119
whole.
Thrasymachus blushes.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:23.711
He blushes when he realized
that he has been defending the

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:27.990
claim not that justice is a
virtue,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:35.757
but that justice is something
that is really a form of

00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:40.430
weakness.
Thrasymachus himself seems to

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:45.918
be embarrassed by his defense of
the tyrannical life,

00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:50.681
of the unjust life.
The suggestion Plato seems to

00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:55.731
be making by making Thrasymachus
blush is, despite all of his

00:17:55.731 --> 00:17:59.276
tough talk,
that he's not as tough as he

00:17:59.276 --> 00:18:03.079
appears to be,
as he wants to think of himself

00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:06.549
to be.
He's shamed by the fact that he

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:11.880
has been defending injustice and
the tyrannical way of life.

00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:18.476
And so it appears,
the three conversations end,

00:18:18.476 --> 00:18:22.470
Book I ends with uncertainty
about what justice is.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.930
We have had three views of
Cephalus, Polemarchus,

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.007
and Thrasymachus.
They have all been refuted,

00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:34.819
but no clear alternative seems
to have emerged.

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:38.689
Certainly Socrates has not
really proposed an alternative

00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:41.660
to Thrasymachus in his exchange
with him;

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.357
he has only,
as it were, forced Thrasymachus

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:48.539
to see that the logic of his
ideas,

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:52.521
the logic of his argument that
justice is in the interest of

00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:55.220
the stronger,
is a defense of tyranny,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.529
and is a defense of the unjust
way of life.

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:05.774
So all of Book I is really a
kind of warm up for what follows

00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:10.411
in the rest of the book.
We find out presumably what

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:13.168
justice is.
Until that point,

00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:19.647
we have no reason to really
give up on our current existing

00:19:19.647 --> 00:19:25.172
ideas about what justice is.
And this is where the two most

00:19:25.172 --> 00:19:28.817
important figures of the
Republic begin to make

00:19:28.817 --> 00:19:30.330
their voices heard.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:40.210
Those are Glaucon and
Adeimantus.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.364
Glaucon tells Socrates that he
is dissatisfied with the

00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:49.849
refutation of Thrasymachus,
and so should we.

00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:54.947
Thrasymachus has been shamed,
he has been forced to see where

00:19:54.947 --> 00:20:00.045
the logic of his argument takes
him, but that is not the same

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:04.322
thing as being refuted.
Thrasymachus is really,

00:20:04.322 --> 00:20:07.942
as it turns out,
a kind of girly-man who is

00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:12.079
ashamed to be seen defending the
unjust life.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:17.240
"But why should we be ashamed
to praise injustice?"

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.590
Glaucon challenges Socrates.
"It's not enough to show that

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.338
justice is wrong," Glaucon says.
"What we need is to hear why

00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:32.568
justice is good," or more
precisely to hear justice

00:20:32.568 --> 00:20:36.880
praised for itself.
"Is there, in your opinion,"

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.342
Glaucon asks Socrates,
"a kind of good that we would

00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:45.980
choose because we delight in it
for its own sake?"

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:51.563
358A.
Is there a kind of good that we

00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:56.445
delight in for its own sake?
And this is where the rubber

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:57.530
hits the road.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:08.119
Who is Glaucon?
Glaucon and Adeimantus are the

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:12.446
brothers of Plato,
and other than their appearance

00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:16.155
in this book,
there is no historical record

00:21:16.155 --> 00:21:21.539
left about them.
But Plato has given us enough.

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:26.072
In the first place,
they are young aristocrats,

00:21:26.072 --> 00:21:31.983
and Glaucon's desire to hear
justice praised for its own sake

00:21:31.983 --> 00:21:36.910
indicates something about his
scale of values.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.636
It would be vulgar,
he believes,

00:21:39.636 --> 00:21:43.595
to speak of justice,
or any virtue in terms of

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:46.849
material rewards or
consequences.

00:21:46.849 --> 00:21:50.893
He does not need to hear
justice praised for its benefit,

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:53.710
he's indifferent to the
consequences.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.700
Rather, he claims that he wants
to hear justice defended the way

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.359
that no one has ever defended it
before.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:05.344
The brothers desire to hear
justice praised for itself

00:22:05.344 --> 00:22:10.799
alone, and that seems to be
expressive of their own freedom

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:14.750
from mercenary motives and
incentives.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:20.227
It reveals to us something
about their idealism and a

00:22:20.227 --> 00:22:24.019
certain kind of loftiness of
soul.

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:26.837
And certainly the brothers,
we find out,

00:22:26.837 --> 00:22:31.720
are not slouches.
They are not slouches at all.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.806
Although it is easy to remember
that later in the dialogue most

00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:40.089
of their contribution seems to
be of the form of "Yes Socrates,

00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:45.609
no Socrates," they seem to be
rather passive interlocutors.

00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:48.887
Their early challenges to
Socrates show them to be

00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:52.919
potential philosophers.
That is to say the kind of

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:56.640
persons who might one day rule
the city.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.960
Of the two, Glaucon seems to be
the superior.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.320
He is described as the most
courageous, which in that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.118
context means the most manly,
the most virile,

00:23:10.118 --> 00:23:14.313
and later Socrates admits that
he has always been full of

00:23:14.313 --> 00:23:17.609
wonder at the nature of the two
brothers.

00:23:17.609 --> 00:23:20.818
And at 368a,
he cites a line of poetry,

00:23:20.818 --> 00:23:24.534
you'll remember,
written about them for their

00:23:24.534 --> 00:23:28.557
distinction in battle,
they have been in war,

00:23:28.557 --> 00:23:31.880
they have been tested in war
obviously.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.318
They are also,
and we see this from their

00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:37.671
relationship between one
another, and the way they speak

00:23:37.671 --> 00:23:40.554
to one another,
they are also highly

00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:47.200
competitive, super achievers.
A little bit like some of you

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.162
perhaps.
There is quite a bit of

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:54.380
jousting between them that you
need to be attentive too.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:00.103
And each proposes to Socrates a
test that he will have to pass

00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:05.640
in order to prove the value of
justice and the just life.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:11.030
Glaucon goes on to rehabilitate
the argument of Thrasymachus in

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.898
many ways, in a more vivid and a
more expressive way than

00:24:15.898 --> 00:24:21.120
Thrasymachus did himself.
Glaucon tells a story,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.645
you'll remember,
a story that he modifies from

00:24:26.645 --> 00:24:32.987
the historian Herodotus,
a story about a man named Gyges

00:24:32.987 --> 00:24:38.847
who possessed a magic ring that
conferred on him the power of

00:24:38.847 --> 00:24:43.004
invisibility.
Who has not wondered what we

00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:48.380
would do if we had this power,
the power of invisibility?

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.171
Gyges, in Glaucon's retelling
of the story,

00:24:52.171 --> 00:24:57.588
Gyges uses this ring to murder
the king and to sleep with his

00:24:57.588 --> 00:25:01.200
wife, and to set himself up as
king.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.177
What would you do if you had
this power, the power of this

00:25:08.177 --> 00:25:13.930
magic ring, where you could
commit any crime,

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.924
indulge any vice,
commit any outrage and be sure

00:25:18.924 --> 00:25:22.750
you could always get away with
it?

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.679
Why if you could do that would
you wish to be just at the same

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:32.859
time, or wish to be just instead
of that?

00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:37.170
This is the challenge that
Glaucon poses to Socrates.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:42.510
Why would someone with absolute
power and complete immunity to

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:47.500
punishment, why would they
prefer justice to injustice?

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.470
"Tell me that Socrates,"
Glaucon asks.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.531
"If justice truly is something
praiseworthy for itself alone,

00:25:55.531 --> 00:26:00.424
then Socrates should be able to
provide an answer that will

00:26:00.424 --> 00:26:04.980
satisfy Glaucon's retelling of
the story of Gyges,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:10.230
that is certainly a very tall
order.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.799
And that is where the brother,
Adeimantus, joins in.

00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:18.740
Adeimantus has a somewhat
different set of concerns.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.500
He has heard justice praised
his whole life from parents and

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.049
from poets and from other
authorities,

00:26:25.049 --> 00:26:28.758
but for the most part,
he has only heard justice

00:26:28.758 --> 00:26:33.334
praised again for the benefits
justice confers both in this

00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:37.373
life and the next.
Honesty is the best policy,

00:26:37.373 --> 00:26:41.979
we've heard Cephalus being
concerned about returning to

00:26:41.979 --> 00:26:46.670
others what you owe as a way of
pleasing the gods in the

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.208
afterlife,
and Adeimantus rightly takes

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:55.049
this kind of argument to mean
that justice is simply a virtue

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:59.057
for the weak,
the lame and the unadventurous,

00:26:59.057 --> 00:27:03.440
if you were only concerned with
the consequences.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.720
A real man does not fear the
consequences of injustice.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.265
Rather, Adeimantus' concern,
and he gives a very revealing

00:27:11.265 --> 00:27:15.059
image of what he takes justice
to be,

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:18.060
is with an image of
self-guardianship,

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.613
or self-control.
He tells us at 367a that each

00:27:22.613 --> 00:27:26.075
would be his own god.
In other words,

00:27:26.075 --> 00:27:29.273
we should not care what people
say about us,

00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:32.843
but we should be prepared to
develop qualities of

00:27:32.843 --> 00:27:36.776
self-containment,
autonomy and independence from

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:40.450
the influence that others can
exercise over us.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.533
"How can I develop those
qualities of self-guardianship

00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:47.809
or self-control?"
he asks Socrates.

00:27:47.809 --> 00:27:50.619
And who has not felt that way
before?

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:54.930
The two brothers desire to hear
justice praised for itself,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.275
Glaucon, and to live freely and
independently,

00:27:58.275 --> 00:28:02.355
Adeimantus.
And that shows to some degree I

00:28:02.355 --> 00:28:07.137
think, their own sense of
alienation from their own

00:28:07.137 --> 00:28:10.531
society.
Or if I can put the case for

00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:15.800
them slightly anachronistically,
these are two sons of the upper

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.819
bourgeois who feel degraded by
the mendacity and hypocrisy of

00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:26.447
the world they see around them.
And anyway, what person with

00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:32.431
any sensitivity to greatness has
not felt this way at one time or

00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:36.020
another?
The two are open to persuasion,

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.737
to consider alternatives,
perhaps even radical

00:28:39.737 --> 00:28:42.710
alternatives,
to the society that has

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.463
nurtured them.
They are, to put it another way

00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:49.773
perhaps, not only potential
rulers and potential

00:28:49.773 --> 00:28:52.810
philosophers,
they may also be potential

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.117
revolutionaries,
and the remainder of the book

00:28:56.117 --> 00:29:00.160
is addressed to them and of
course people like them.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.930
But the speeches of Glaucon and
Adeimantus, you might say the

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.619
circle around Socrates is
effectively closed.

00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:19.306
He knows he will not be
returning to Athens that

00:29:19.306 --> 00:29:24.247
evening, and he proposes to the
two brothers and those listening

00:29:24.247 --> 00:29:29.031
to the conversation a kind of
thought experiment that he hopes

00:29:29.031 --> 00:29:33.172
will work magic on the two.
"Let us propose," he says,

00:29:33.172 --> 00:29:35.980
"to watch a city coming into
being in speech."

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.304
Let us create a city in speech.
"It is easier," he says,

00:29:41.304 --> 00:29:45.205
"not to view justice
microscopically in an

00:29:45.205 --> 00:29:50.820
individual, but rather let's
view justice as it were through

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.267
a magnifying glass."
Let's view justice in the large

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:59.126
sense.
Let us view justice in a city

00:29:59.126 --> 00:30:03.609
in order to help us understand
what it is in an individual.

00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:08.949
And this idea that the city is
essentially analogous to the

00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:12.539
soul, that the city is like the
soul,

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:18.206
is the central metaphor around
which the entire Republic

00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:21.548
is constructed.
It seems to be presented

00:30:21.548 --> 00:30:25.349
entirely innocuously,
no one in the dialogue objects

00:30:25.349 --> 00:30:28.054
to it,
yet everything else follows

00:30:28.054 --> 00:30:31.670
from this idea that the city,
the polis,

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.344
is in the central respect like
an individual,

00:30:35.344 --> 00:30:40.694
like the soul of an individual.
What is Socrates trying to do

00:30:40.694 --> 00:30:45.525
here, and what is that metaphor,
that central metaphor,

00:30:45.525 --> 00:30:49.730
what function does it serve
within the work?

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:54.010
To state the obvious,
Socrates introduces this

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:59.526
analogy to help the brothers
better understand what justice

00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:04.839
is for an individual soul.
The governance of the soul,

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:08.117
Adeimantus' standard of
self-control,

00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:12.944
must be like the governance of
a city in some decisive

00:31:12.944 --> 00:31:15.690
respects.
But in what respects?

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.787
How is a city like a soul and
in what respect is

00:31:18.787 --> 00:31:21.753
self-governance,
the control of one's passions

00:31:21.753 --> 00:31:25.768
and appetites,
in what respect is self-control

00:31:25.768 --> 00:31:29.599
like the governance of a
collective body?

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:36.629
Consider the following example:
when we say that so and so is

00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:41.683
typically American,
or typically Taiwanese for

00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:47.368
example, we mean that that
person expresses certain traits

00:31:47.368 --> 00:31:53.253
of character and behavior that
are broadly representative in

00:31:53.253 --> 00:31:58.740
some way of the cross section of
their countrymen.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.127
Is this a useful way to think?
More specifically,

00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:08.060
what does it mean to say that
an individual can be seen as

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.219
magnified in his or her country,
or that one's country is simply

00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:17.066
the collective expression of
certain individual traits of

00:32:17.066 --> 00:32:20.960
character?
That seems to be what Socrates

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.187
is suggesting.
Right, that's what he's getting

00:32:24.187 --> 00:32:24.410
at.

00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:33.432
One way of thinking about the
metaphor of city and soul

00:32:33.432 --> 00:32:37.437
together is to think of it as a
particular kind of causal

00:32:37.437 --> 00:32:40.833
hypothesis,
about the formation of both

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:45.049
individual character and
political institutions.

00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:49.905
In this reading of the
city/soul analogy as a kind of

00:32:49.905 --> 00:32:53.827
causal relation,
maintains the view that as

00:32:53.827 --> 00:32:59.336
individuals we both shape and
determine the character of our

00:32:59.336 --> 00:33:03.238
societies,
and that those societies in

00:33:03.238 --> 00:33:07.430
term shape and determine
individual character.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.652
The city and soul analogy could
be seen then as an attempt to

00:33:11.652 --> 00:33:15.029
understand how societies
reproduce themselves,

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:20.074
and how they shape citizens who
again in turn shape the

00:33:20.074 --> 00:33:25.380
societies in which they inhabit.
That seems to be one way of

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:30.193
making sense of the city/soul
hypothesis, but again it doesn't

00:33:30.193 --> 00:33:34.375
seem to answer the question in
what way are cities and

00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:38.496
individuals alike.
To take the American case for

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:43.109
example, does it mean that
something like the presidency,

00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:48.486
the congress and the court can
be discerned within the soul of

00:33:48.486 --> 00:33:53.564
every American citizen?
That would be absurd to think

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:56.850
that obviously.
I mean, I think that would be

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.571
absurd.
Maybe you want to argue it and

00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:03.924
we could have a discussion,
but it might mean that American

00:34:03.924 --> 00:34:06.937
democracy,
or democracy of any kind,

00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:11.420
helps to produce a particular
kind of democratic soul.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.335
Just like, you might say,
the old regime in France,

00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:20.190
the old aristocratic society
existing before the revolution,

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.413
tended to produce a very
different kind of soul,

00:34:23.413 --> 00:34:26.019
a very different kind of
individual.

00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:30.940
Every regime will produce a
distinctive kind of individual,

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:36.115
and this individual will come
to embody the dominant character

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:40.590
traits of the particular regime.
The remainder of the

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.071
Republic is,
again, devoted to crafting the

00:34:44.071 --> 00:34:47.694
regime that will produce a
distinctive kind of human

00:34:47.694 --> 00:34:51.561
character,
and that of course is why the

00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:55.799
book is a utopia.
There has never been a regime

00:34:55.799 --> 00:35:00.280
in history that was so
single-mindedly devoted to the

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.192
end of producing that rarest and
most difficult species of

00:35:05.192 --> 00:35:08.640
humanity called simply
philosopher.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.860
So, city and soul.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.994
That leads to our next topic
that I want to pursue for the

00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:33.929
remainder of the class,
the reform of poetry and the

00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:36.927
arts.
Socrates' city speech proceeds

00:35:36.927 --> 00:35:40.575
through several stages.
The first stage proposed by

00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:44.538
Adeimantus is the simple city,
what he calls the city of

00:35:44.538 --> 00:35:48.708
utmost necessity.
That is a city limited to the

00:35:48.708 --> 00:35:52.190
satisfaction of certain basic
needs.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:57.430
The primitive or simple city,
the city of utmost necessity,

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:02.489
again it expresses the nature
of Adeimantus' own soul,

00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:07.083
there is a kind of noble
simplicity in him that treats

00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:11.849
subjects as bodies or creatures
of limited appetites.

00:36:11.849 --> 00:36:17.174
The simple city is little more
than a combination of households

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:21.639
designed for the sake of
securing one's existence.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:26.137
And at this point,
and you can hear his brother

00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:30.440
chastising him,
at this point Glaucon retorts

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.404
that it seems as if Adeimantus
has created a city only fit for

00:36:36.404 --> 00:36:38.690
pigs,
a city of pigs.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:43.360
Are we only such that we want
to feed at a common trough?

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.579
Is there nothing more to
politics than that?

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:49.710
And Glaucon says,
"Where are the luxuries?

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.639
Where are the relishes," he
asks.

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:56.130
"Where are the things that make
up a city?"

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.285
And hereto Glaucon's city
expresses his own tastes and his

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:04.563
own soul.
The war-like Glaucon would

00:37:04.563 --> 00:37:08.779
preside over what Socrates calls
a feverish city,

00:37:08.779 --> 00:37:13.698
one that institutionalizes
honors, competitions and above

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:16.063
all war.
If Adeimantus,

00:37:16.063 --> 00:37:20.257
again, expresses the appetitive
part of the soul,

00:37:20.257 --> 00:37:25.850
Glaucon represents the quality
that Plato calls spiritedness,

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:31.557
or thumos in Greek.
Spiritedness is the central,

00:37:31.557 --> 00:37:36.760
psychological quality of the
Republic.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.046
The entire thrust of the book
is devoted to the taming of

00:37:41.046 --> 00:37:43.648
spiritedness,
and to the control of

00:37:43.648 --> 00:37:47.943
spiritedness.
Spiritedness is that quality of

00:37:47.943 --> 00:37:53.349
soul that is most closely
associated with the desires for

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:58.405
honors, fame and prestige.
It is a higher order

00:37:58.405 --> 00:38:02.946
psychological quality.
It seeks distinction,

00:38:02.946 --> 00:38:08.600
the desire to be first in the
race of life and lead us to seek

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.119
to dominate others.
We all know people of this

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:16.672
sort, do we not?
And we all to some degree

00:38:16.672 --> 00:38:19.300
embody this quality in
ourselves.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.250
It is the quality that we
associate with being a kind of

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:29.088
alpha personality.
This is the issue for Socrates,

00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:34.576
how to channel this wild and
untamed passion of spirit or

00:38:34.576 --> 00:38:40.260
heart, how to channel this to
some kind of common good.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.014
Can it be done?
How can we begin the

00:38:44.014 --> 00:38:48.000
domestication of the spirited
Glaucon?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.539
The rest of the book is to some
degree about taming,

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:57.079
asking the question whether
Glaucon can be tamed.

00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:02.436
And it is here that Socrates
turns to his first and perhaps

00:39:02.436 --> 00:39:07.700
even his most controversial
proposal for the establishment

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.583
of the just city.
"The creation of the just city

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:17.685
can only begin," he says,
"with the control of music,

00:39:17.685 --> 00:39:22.399
poetry and the arts."
And this is where Plato's image

00:39:22.399 --> 00:39:24.150
as an educator drives.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:31.790
The first order of business for
the founder of a city,

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.699
any city, is the oversight of
education.

00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:37.888
And his proposals for the
reform of poetry,

00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:41.911
especially Homeric poetry,
represent clearly a radical

00:39:41.911 --> 00:39:46.389
departure from Greek educational
practices and beliefs.

00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:50.269
Why is this so important for
Socrates?

00:39:50.269 --> 00:39:54.477
Ask yourself,
if you were founding a city,

00:39:54.477 --> 00:39:59.325
where would you begin?
Socrates' argument seems to be

00:39:59.325 --> 00:40:03.380
something like this:
it is from the poets and I mean

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.719
that in the broadest sense of
the term,

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:09.422
myth makers,
storytellers,

00:40:09.422 --> 00:40:14.287
artist, musicians,
today we might say film and

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:19.469
television producers,
it is from these people that we

00:40:19.469 --> 00:40:24.269
receive our earliest and most
vivid impressions of heroes and

00:40:24.269 --> 00:40:28.559
villains,
gods and the afterlife.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:31.389
These stories,
the stories we hear from

00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:34.590
earliest childhood on,
shape us in some very

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:38.090
meaningful sense for the rest of
our lives.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:44.088
And the Homeric epics were of
course for the Greeks what the

00:40:44.088 --> 00:40:47.224
Bible was for us.
Maybe even is in some

00:40:47.224 --> 00:40:49.648
communities.
The names of Achilles,

00:40:49.648 --> 00:40:51.861
Priam, Hector,
Odysseus, Ajax,

00:40:51.861 --> 00:40:56.286
these would have been just as
familiar and important to the

00:40:56.286 --> 00:41:00.329
contemporaries of Plato as the
names of Abraham,

00:41:00.329 --> 00:41:05.250
Isaac, Joshua and Jesus are for
us.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:10.610
Plato's critique of Homeric
poetry in the Republic is

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.359
two-fold;
it is both theological and

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:16.092
political.
Maybe you might even say

00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:19.578
following Spinoza,
that this is the core of

00:41:19.578 --> 00:41:23.480
Plato's theological political
treatise here.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.627
The theological critique is
that Homer simply depicts the

00:41:28.627 --> 00:41:32.579
gods as false,
as fickle, and inconstant.

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:37.800
He presents them as beings who
are unworthy of our worship.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.405
More importantly,
the Homeric heroes are said to

00:41:41.405 --> 00:41:45.010
be bad role models for those who
follow them,

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.723
they are shown to be
intemperate in sex,

00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:53.580
overly fond of money,
into these vices Socrates adds

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:59.769
cruelty and disregard for the
dead bodies of one's opponents.

00:41:59.769 --> 00:42:04.719
The Homeric heroes are ignorant
and passionate men full of blind

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:07.469
anger and desire for
retribution.

00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:14.097
How could such figures possibly
serve as good role models for

00:42:14.097 --> 00:42:19.083
citizens of a just city?
And Socrates' answer is,

00:42:19.083 --> 00:42:24.191
of course, the predation of
poetry and the arts in Books II

00:42:24.191 --> 00:42:27.203
and III.
He wants to deprive poets of

00:42:27.203 --> 00:42:30.998
their power to enchant,
and something Socrates admits

00:42:30.998 --> 00:42:34.210
in the tenth book of the
Republic,

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:38.860
to which he himself has been
highly susceptible to the

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.236
enchantment of the poets.
We need to deprive,

00:42:43.236 --> 00:42:46.720
again, the poets,
the song makers,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.099
the lyricists,
the musicians,

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:52.916
the mythmakers,
the storytellers,

00:42:52.916 --> 00:42:56.349
all of them,
the power to enchant us.

00:42:56.349 --> 00:43:01.142
And in place of the pedagogical
power of poetry,

00:43:01.142 --> 00:43:06.750
Socrates proposes to install
philosophy in its place.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.293
As a result,
the poets will have to be

00:43:09.293 --> 00:43:12.960
expelled from this city.
Imagine that.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.072
Sophocles will be expelled from
the just city that Socrates

00:43:19.072 --> 00:43:23.698
wants to create.
This always raises the question

00:43:23.698 --> 00:43:28.274
that you will discuss in your
section, whether or not

00:43:28.274 --> 00:43:33.731
Socrates' censorship of poetry
and the arts is an indication of

00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:38.181
his totalitarian impulses.
This is the part of the

00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:42.747
Republic most likely to
call up our own first amendment

00:43:42.747 --> 00:43:44.875
instincts.
"Who are you,

00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:49.941
Socrates," we are inclined to
ask, "to tell us what we can

00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:53.708
read here and listen to?"
And furthermore,

00:43:53.708 --> 00:43:58.744
Socrates seems to be saying not
that the Kallipolis will have no

00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:02.181
poetry and music,
it will simply be Socratic

00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.336
poetry and music.
And there's another question

00:44:05.336 --> 00:44:07.829
which you would no doubt be
concerned to discuss,

00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:12.143
namely what would such
Socratically purified music and

00:44:12.143 --> 00:44:15.380
poetry look like?
What would it sound like?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.779
I don't know that I have an
answer to this,

00:44:18.779 --> 00:44:23.797
but perhaps the Republic
as a whole is itself a piece of

00:44:23.797 --> 00:44:29.219
this Socratic poetry that will
substitute for the Homeric kind.

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:33.571
But it's important to remember
that the question of education

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:37.922
and the question of the reform
and censorship and the control

00:44:37.922 --> 00:44:42.273
of poetry is introduced in the
context of taming the war-like

00:44:42.273 --> 00:44:45.610
passions of Glaucon and others
like him.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.980
The question of censorship and
the telling of lies is

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.552
introduced, in other words,
as a question of military

00:44:52.552 --> 00:44:56.478
necessity, controlling the
guards or the auxiliaries of the

00:44:56.478 --> 00:44:58.460
city,
its warrior class.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.629
Nothing is said here about the
education of farmers,

00:45:02.629 --> 00:45:06.880
artisans, merchants,
laborers, the economic class.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.468
Maybe, to speak bluntly,
Socrates just doesn't care that

00:45:11.468 --> 00:45:14.980
much about them.
It's okay what they listen too.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.926
Nor has anything really been
said up to this point about the

00:45:18.926 --> 00:45:23.010
education of the philosopher.
His interest here is in the

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.809
creation of a tight,
and highly disciplined cadre of

00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:31.054
young warriors who will protect
the city much as watchdogs

00:45:31.054 --> 00:45:34.335
protect their own home.
That is to say,

00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:38.400
recalling Polemarchus,
those who are good to friends

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.090
and bark and growl at strangers.
Such individuals will

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:48.157
subordinate their own desires
and pleasures to the group,

00:45:48.157 --> 00:45:52.230
and live a life by a strict
code of honor.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.781
We have to ask:
are Socrates' proposals

00:45:55.781 --> 00:45:58.650
unrealistic?
Are they undesirable?

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:03.074
Or are they desirable?
They are not undesirable if you

00:46:03.074 --> 00:46:07.227
believe as he does that even the
best city must provide

00:46:07.227 --> 00:46:11.613
provisions for war,
and therefore a warrior's life,

00:46:11.613 --> 00:46:15.783
a soldier's life,
will require harsh privation in

00:46:15.783 --> 00:46:20.127
terms of material rewards and
benefits as well as a

00:46:20.127 --> 00:46:23.690
willingness to sacrifice for
others.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.825
It would seem far from being
unrealistic, Socrates engages

00:46:28.825 --> 00:46:33.690
what we might call maybe a kind
of Socratic realism.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:37.283
Far more unrealistic would be
the belief of those who argue,

00:46:37.283 --> 00:46:40.877
and I'm thinking here of names
like Immanuel Kant and others

00:46:40.877 --> 00:46:43.739
from the eighteenth and
nineteenth century,

00:46:43.739 --> 00:46:48.249
that one day we can abolish war
altogether, and therefore

00:46:48.249 --> 00:46:52.920
abolish the passions that give
rise to conflict and war.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.922
So far Plato believes,
is a passionate or spirited

00:46:57.922 --> 00:47:03.945
aspect of nature remains strong
so long will be necessary to

00:47:03.945 --> 00:47:09.050
educate the warriors of society
who defend it.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:13.240
So on that I'm going to end
today and next time we will talk

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.224
about justice,
the philosophers and Plato's

00:47:16.224 --> 00:47:17.690
discovery of America.

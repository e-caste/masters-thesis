00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.550
Prof: Okay,
today we're going to talk about

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.181
sex allocation theory,
and I would like to begin by

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:11.280
reminding you of where we're at
in the course.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.992
We're in the middle of
micro-evolutionary evolutionary

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.379
biology,
the micro part,

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:23.640
and we are now applying the
ideas that we've developed to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.088
try to understand the design of
phenotypes for reproductive

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:30.310
success.
 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.545
This portion of the course
basically started with the

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.894
evolution of sex,
and then we saw that sexual-

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:41.404
the evolution of sex opened up
all sorts of possibilities for

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:47.003
genomic conflict in evolution,
and that gave us the image of

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:52.670
the organism as not necessarily
being optimized or just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.930
adaptive.
 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.020
The organism can be viewed as a
composite, and the parts of the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.880
composite can be in conflict
with each other.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.813
With life history evolution,
we've more or less shifted back

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:10.879
to a view of the organism as
being optimized in some sense.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:13.607
I think we saw that most
clearly with the kestrel

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.620
parental investment and
investment in clutch size,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.361
and in things like optimal
reaction norms for age and size

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.280
at maturity.
 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.726
Now, when we go to sex
allocation, we are looking again

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:30.560
at how to optimize the life
history.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.668
But the issue now is how much
should be invested in male

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:39.300
function and how much should be
invested in female function?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.640
And this opens the doorway also
to alternative explanations.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.654
Some of these patterns that
we're going to be looking at can

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:54.010
be seen as the result of more or
less an optimality argument,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.830
that this is the best way it
could be done,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.090
given the constraints on the
system,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.634
but in other places it's
possible that there are

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:06.159
fundamental conflicts going on
and that nobody's winning,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.520
that everybody's making the
best of a bad job.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.718
And I think that you'll see
some of that when we get into

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:17.470
the frequency dependent parts of
sex allocation.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.175
So sex allocation theory is
actually a part of evolutionary

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.908
ecology which has been extremely
successful.

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:29.847
It predicts the distribution of
reproductive effort among male

00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:32.879
and female offspring,
or between male and female

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.720
function.
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.710
It makes a lot of successful
predictions.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.785
There is a theorem at the heart
of this part of biology called

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:43.258
the Shaw-Mohler theorem,
which is very general in the

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:47.667
way it's formulated,
and it unites many previously

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.910
unrelated phenomena.
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.574
So the successful predictions,
and the bringing together in a

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.871
single explanatory framework of
a lot of stuff that was

00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:00.923
previously seen as unconnected,
is a characteristic of any good

00:03:00.923 --> 00:03:02.060
scientific theory.
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.388
After all, that's what the
Periodic Table does in

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:06.908
chemistry;
that's what Newton did with his

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:07.908
Laws of Motion.
 

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:14.979
So this is a good example of
success in evolutionary theory.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.918
In order to get into this
field, we need to have a little

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:22.435
vocabulary building,
just so you can operate in the

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.490
literature.
 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.091
If you're a botanist,
you call organisms that have

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:31.060
separate sexes dioecious,
and if you're a zoologist you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.780
tend to call them
gonorchoristic.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.830
The default condition in most
flowering plants is that they're

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.680
hermaphrodites and they have
both male and female parts in

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680
the same flower.
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.729
But there are some striking
exceptions.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.090
Papayas have separate male and
female sexes;

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.639
holly have separate male and
female plants;

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.470
and so forth.
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.900
So there are certainly
dioecious plants.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.497
The default condition in most
animals is that the sexes are

00:03:59.497 --> 00:04:00.180
separate.
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.282
So the default condition is
different in most flowering

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.788
plants and most higher animals.
 

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.726
Now if we're dealing with
sequential hermaphrodites,

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:12.718
then they can be either
protandric or protogynous.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.800
We call them protandric--so
first male,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.833
pro andros--if they're born as
males and change later to

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.127
females,
and we call them protogynous if

00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:27.060
they are first females and then
change to males.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.370
Okay?
 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.009
The only human in mythology,
at least in Western mythology,

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.807
who has done something like
this was the Greek sage

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:38.824
Tiresias,
who was a prophet during the

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:40.649
Trojan War and is said to have
been,

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.000
in his lifetime,
both male and female,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.329
having been changed by the
gods, rather than by his

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:48.442
hormones,
and was able to report on what

00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:49.379
it's like.
 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.949
You might want to go back and
check.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.973
Now for the purposes of sex
allocation theory,

00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:02.629
we define female function in a
number of different ways.

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:03.370
Okay?
 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.317
It could either be the
proportion of offspring that are

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:09.689
female;
that could be a lot or a little.

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.160
It could be investment in
female versus male offspring;

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.108
so you have equal numbers of
both but you decide to invest

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:18.490
more in offspring of one sex
than the other.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.483
Or in a sequential or
simultaneous hermaphrodite,

00:05:21.483 --> 00:05:25.101
it's the proportion of lifetime
reproductive success gained

00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:27.410
through reproduction as a
female.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.790
So female function can have to
do with timing,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.420
with investment and with
numbers;

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.089
male function is defined
similarly.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.940
So there are some very basic
questions about sex allocation.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.209
One is, what's the equilibrium
sex ratio?

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:49.913
What should we expect to see in
a population that has separate

00:05:49.913 --> 00:05:50.399
sexes?
 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:54.646
Another is if the species we're
dealing with is a sequential

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.637
hermaphrodite,
as what sex should that

00:05:57.637 --> 00:06:01.608
organism be born,
and how old and large should it

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:03.550
be when it changes sex?
 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.668
If it's a simultaneous
hermaphrodite,

00:06:05.668 --> 00:06:08.670
then what would be the
allocation to male and female

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.259
function in simultaneous
hermaphrodites?

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.572
We're not going to talk about
this very much today,

00:06:13.572 --> 00:06:16.163
but I would like to give you
just a little bit of natural

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:16.720
history.
 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.899
There is a lovely Caribbean
fish called the Hamlet,

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:21.569
which is a simultaneous
hermaphrodite,

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.790
and it can make eggs and sperm
at the same time,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.569
and they mate every day,
and when they get together to

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.264
mate,
there's the issue of who should

00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:34.690
be male and who should be female
for this mating?

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.819
And the eggs are big and
expensive,

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.048
and the sperm is small and
cheap, and so you don't want to

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:42.389
get cheated by somebody who
never wants to be the female and

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.579
just makes sperm.
 

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:47.089
So what they've come up with is
a mating pattern where in order

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.103
to mate at all,
they more or less insist that

00:06:50.103 --> 00:06:53.199
they trade roles and do it about
ten times,

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.300
so that they equal out.
 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.519
So in the course of twenty
minutes,

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.430
they will switch back and forth
from being male to female,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.805
and then each of them will have
put out roughly the same amount

00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:05.930
of eggs and the same amount of
sperm.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.732
So I just wanted you to have
that in the background as one of

00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:13.028
the sort of paradigmatic
examples of how simultaneous

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:15.689
hermaphrodites have solved that
issue.

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.040
And then there's the
interesting issue--

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.738
and by the way,
this is something I stuck in

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:21.689
here this morning,
so those of you who have

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.572
printed out your PDFs,
this is new--when should

00:07:24.572 --> 00:07:28.761
differential investment in
offspring of each sex depend on

00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:30.009
social status?
 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.706
And I stuck this question in
here, because in fact the

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:34.029
lecture deals with that.
 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:35.949
We're going to come to the
Trivers-Willard hypothesis,

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.139
and we will see that social
status,

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:44.192
or physiological status,
really does affect sex

00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:46.940
allocation quite a bit.
 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.235
So these are all aspects
actually of one problem,

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:53.740
and that problem arises because
of this key fact.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.605
Every diploid sexually produced
zygote is getting half of its

00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:01.470
autosomal genes from its father
and half from its mother,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.298
and that's also true of the
sequential and simultaneous

00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:06.918
hermaphrodites;
okay, that's what it means to

00:08:06.918 --> 00:08:08.170
be a sexual diploid.
 

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.528
And that has a consequence.
 

00:08:10.528 --> 00:08:13.415
It means that the fitness
that's gained by an individual

00:08:13.415 --> 00:08:16.668
through male function has to be
compared with fitness gained by

00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:19.028
other individuals through male
function,

00:08:19.028 --> 00:08:23.060
and similarly for fitness
gained through female function.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.245
In other words,
male and female function are

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:28.470
equivalent paths to fitness.
 

00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:36.394
Now in a number of
circumstances in evolutionary

00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:41.350
biology it is advantageous to
use what I call 'the looking

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:47.000
backwards ploy' to develop an
intuition for why this is true.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.440
Think about the genes in your
body--

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.889
you got half from your mom and
half from your dad--

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:55.163
and look backwards to where
they were sitting in

00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:58.043
grandparents,
great-grandparents,

00:08:58.043 --> 00:09:01.340
great-great-grandparents,
and so forth.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.269
And if you go through that
branching tree,

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:05.684
going backwards,
you'll see that in each

00:09:05.684 --> 00:09:09.402
generation half of them were
coming down through a female and

00:09:09.402 --> 00:09:12.500
half of them were coming down
through a male,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.389
and as they go forward,
into the future,

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.340
it's always going to be,
on average,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.120
half of them coming down
through a male and half of them

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.690
coming down through a female.
 

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.100
This means essentially that
this statement,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.370
male and female function are
equivalent paths to fitness,

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.006
is something that you could
derive by putting out the whole

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:38.707
genealogy of the family tree and
just counting the number of

00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:42.658
times that genes had occurred in
male or female ancestors,

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:44.909
and you would discover that it
was 50:50.

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:47.210
Okay?
 

00:09:47.210 --> 00:10:01.340
&lt;&lt;Request to turn off
cell phones&gt;&gt;

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.924
Okay, we start this kind of
analysis with the default

00:10:05.924 --> 00:10:09.629
condition, which is the 50:50
sex ratio.

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:11.379
That's a photo of Ronald Fisher.
 

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.450
He came up with this idea.
 

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.445
He's one of the people,
by the way, who demonstrated

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:19.086
that Mendel's laws are
consistent with natural

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:19.908
selection.
 

00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:22.509
He also invented quantitative
genetics, and he invented the

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:24.168
analysis of variance in
statistics.

00:10:24.168 --> 00:10:27.879
He was a total autistic geek
and a nasty father,

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:31.086
and his daughter wrote a really
fascinating biography of what it

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:32.970
was like to grow up with this
guy,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.980
who was a fulltime,
24/7 biologist,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.193
and who kept all kinds of
plants and animals around the

00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:43.818
house and kept breeding them,
but was not what you would call

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:46.408
a terribly empathetic,
emotional person.

00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:50.313
And he also was a guy who was
nearly blind,

00:10:50.313 --> 00:10:54.870
but who visualized most
problems geometrically.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.208
He was very powerful
mathematically,

00:10:57.208 --> 00:11:00.951
but Fisher essentially saw
things geometrically that most

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.889
people see algebraically.
 

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:08.129
So his theoretical writings can
be opaque at times.

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:12.288
But, this idea is pretty
straightforward:

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:15.585
If males and females are
equally good at producing male

00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:18.756
and female offspring,
at all ages and sizes--so

00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:22.240
everybody's pretty much on a
level playing field--

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.860
if mating's at random,
in a big, large population,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.010
that's thoroughly mixed,
then the sex ratio should

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.399
evolve to 50:50 male/female
offspring.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:39.236
Basically the reason that's
true is that the rarer sex has

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:40.509
an advantage.
 

00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:43.831
The sex ratio is adjusted until
neither type is rarer than the

00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:47.099
other, and that's probably the
most basic frequency dependent

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.570
equilibrium in biology.
 

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.312
You can see why that would be
true if you imagined that you

00:11:56.312 --> 00:12:00.519
were a mutation that produced
only male offspring in a

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:05.679
population that was otherwise
producing all female offspring.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.543
You would then have the only
males in that population,

00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:17.649
and all of the offspring in the
next generation would be

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:19.440
carrying your genes.
 

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.649
You would increase in frequency.
 

00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:25.788
You can see how it would work
in the other direction,

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:28.210
if you do this kind of mutation
invasion analysis,

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.403
by asking yourself,
what would happen if everybody

00:12:30.403 --> 00:12:33.586
else in the population was male,
or everyone else in the

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.538
population only produced male
offspring,

00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:39.070
and you're the only one to make
female offspring?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.299
Well you get--all of the
grandchildren are yours.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:43.788
Okay?
 

00:12:43.788 --> 00:12:45.950
So you increase from the other
direction.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.635
So if you imagine populations
that are being invaded by these

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:52.023
different alternatives,
they come together at the

00:12:52.023 --> 00:12:57.360
middle, and it's only at 50:50
that there's an equilibrium.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.019
This may be why sex chromosomes
evolved.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:03.340
Okay?
 

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.659
We have sex chromosomes,
we have an X and Y chromosome.

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:07.899
That guarantees 50:50.
 

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:10.788
But before there were sex
chromosomes,

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:14.379
there was sex,
and there were evolutionary

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:17.710
dynamics,
and it may be that this is why

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.129
organisms with sex chromosomes
have evolved.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:23.480
There are many other ways of
determining sex.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.178
You don't have to have sex
chromosomes.

00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:28.668
Crocodiles and turtles do it
with temperature.

00:13:28.668 --> 00:13:31.549
Sometimes parasites determine
what sex you are;

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.720
Wolbachia will do that.
 

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.022
Sometimes sex is determined by
a quantitative process of many

00:13:38.022 --> 00:13:41.250
genes, rather than having a sex
chromosome.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.599
So this process,
which we find to be almost

00:13:45.599 --> 00:13:51.812
intuitive because we have sex
chromosomes and that's what our

00:13:51.812 --> 00:13:56.678
population does,
in fact is a special case.

00:13:56.678 --> 00:14:01.150
But it appears that it would
have evolved out of this kind of

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.548
a situation: big populations
with fairly equal opportunities

00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:06.889
for everybody.
 

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:09.971
If these assumptions are
violated, we get changes in the

00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:12.572
optimal sex ratio,
and it's the Shaw-Mohler

00:14:12.572 --> 00:14:16.188
theorem that predicts what would
happen when these assumptions

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.019
don't hold.
 

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:18.120
So let's have a look at it.
 

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.368
A mutation will invade a
population if it can increase

00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:29.037
fitness through one sex more
than it decreases fitness

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:30.558
through the other.
 

00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:33.298
And if we state that as an
inequality,

00:14:33.298 --> 00:14:36.219
the change in male function
divided by average male

00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:38.092
function,
plus the change in female

00:14:38.092 --> 00:14:39.769
function,
divided by average female

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:41.830
function,
needs to be greater than 0.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.553
Here, little-m and little-f are
the average fitness through male

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:50.230
and female function in our
resident population.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.308
So we're starting just at some
starting point in evolution,

00:14:54.308 --> 00:14:56.509
and there's an average male and
female function,

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:59.969
and a mutation pops up that
changes male and female

00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:00.730
function.
 

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:08.070
So its change is the critical
thing.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.522
Is it changing one of them
enough to compensate enough for

00:15:12.522 --> 00:15:13.460
the other?
 

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.865
So if the percent increase in
fitness through one sex is

00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:20.519
greater than the percent
decrease through the other sex,

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:25.558
this mutation will invade,
and that will go on until a new

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.769
equilibrium is reached.
 

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:31.649
So this is more or less the
invasion criterion.

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:36.029
We're going to see three cases
in which it works pretty well.

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:38.154
There are more,
but I've just selected three

00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:39.490
that are fairly dramatic.
 

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.832
One is local mate competition;
the next is sequential

00:15:42.832 --> 00:15:46.046
hermaphrodites;
and the third is social rank in

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.158
sex allocation.
 

00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:52.259
So the local mate competition
one is one that you're actually

00:15:52.259 --> 00:15:55.408
already familiar with;
I've mentioned it.

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:58.447
I will also give a second
species, a mite,

00:15:58.447 --> 00:16:00.820
that does something like this.
 

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.522
So what would the sex ratio be
if all of the grandchildren stem

00:16:05.522 --> 00:16:08.860
from matings between brothers
and sisters?

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:14.330
Well you would make one son and
as many daughters as possible.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.850
And to get there from a 50:50
sex ratio,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.168
basically you can see,
I think, that if--

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:30.590
we can go stepwise--if the
fecundity of this creature--

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:37.240
it's a mite usually or
sometimes it's a wasp--

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.759
the fecundity might be say
twenty offspring,

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:44.719
and if it was at 50:50 sex
ratio, then the average mite in

00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:49.940
the population would be making
ten sons and ten daughters.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.292
But if all the sons are only
inseminating only those

00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:57.105
daughters, then anybody that
made eleven daughters and nine

00:16:57.105 --> 00:16:59.668
sons would have more
grandchildren;

00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:02.158
twelve daughters and eight sons
would have even more

00:17:02.158 --> 00:17:03.660
grandchildren;
and so forth,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.990
until you get down to nineteen
daughters and just one son,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.088
and that one son inseminates
all nineteen daughters,

00:17:09.088 --> 00:17:11.933
and the nineteen daughters are
making almost twice as many

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:14.328
grandchildren as the ten
daughters would have.

00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:17.769
So they're just gaining all the
way down, to the point where

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:19.108
there's just one son.
 

00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:23.598
And that is exactly what
Acarophenax does.

00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:25.278
It's a haplo-diploid parasitic
mite--

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:28.313
haplo-diploid means that the
males are haploid and the

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:31.376
females are diploid--
and there's incestuous

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:34.000
fertilization inside the mother.
 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.472
So the one son inseminates all
of the daughters,

00:17:37.472 --> 00:17:41.094
and then once that's
accomplished the son dies and

00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:44.789
the daughters eat the mother,
from the inside.

00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:50.654
So the curse on the House of
Atreus was peanuts,

00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:51.390
compared to this.
 

00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:57.019
This is what these things look
like.

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:01.148
This is a straw itch mite,
and any of you who have been

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:03.382
out in August,
cutting the lawn,

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.630
and then had little bites on
your legs,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.400
were probably getting bitten by
this thing.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.895
It makes 98% daughters,
and it has that kind of

00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:14.069
lifecycle.
 

00:18:17.578 --> 00:18:23.712
Okay, so that is the case where
the Shaw-Mohler theorem works

00:18:23.712 --> 00:18:24.940
perfectly.
 

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.154
A mutation invading this
population is increasing the

00:18:28.154 --> 00:18:31.680
number of grandchildren by
increasing female function,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.921
and they are not losing
anything in male function

00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.973
because that one son is still
capable of inseminating all the

00:18:38.973 --> 00:18:39.920
daughters.
 

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.392
Now if we go to sequential
hermaphrodites,

00:18:43.392 --> 00:18:48.219
it's useful to think of it
as--this would be either an age

00:18:48.219 --> 00:18:52.325
or a size advantage model;
the size advantage model is

00:18:52.325 --> 00:18:55.338
probably the more intuitive way
to think about it--

00:18:55.338 --> 00:18:59.160
and this model is used to
answer the question,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.476
into what sex should a
sequential hermaphrodite be

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.614
born;
so what should the baby be,

00:19:04.614 --> 00:19:08.188
and then how old and how large
should it be when it changes

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:08.618
sex?
 

00:19:08.618 --> 00:19:14.898
And the size advantage model
basically sketches out lines of

00:19:14.898 --> 00:19:17.729
fitness,
increasing with size,

00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:20.808
but they increase at different
rates,

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:24.944
and basically the argument is
you should be born into the sex

00:19:24.944 --> 00:19:29.079
that has higher fitness when
you're small and then you should

00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:33.558
change into the sex that has
higher fitness when you're big,

00:19:33.558 --> 00:19:36.230
and you should change at the
point where the lines cross.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:43.368
And if this line is higher here
for females,

00:19:43.368 --> 00:19:49.779
and higher here for males,
we have protogyny,

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.884
and if it's higher here for
males, and higher here for

00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:55.759
females,
we have protandry.

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:59.487
So you should be born as a
male, if your fitness as a male

00:19:59.487 --> 00:20:03.617
when you're small is greater,
and then change into a female,

00:20:03.617 --> 00:20:07.626
and you should be born as a
female and change if the biology

00:20:07.626 --> 00:20:11.500
dictates that your fitness is
higher when you're big,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.430
as a female--as a male.
 

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:20.470
And the reasons for this are
both physiological and social.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:26.115
The default condition actually
is that small things do just

00:20:26.115 --> 00:20:29.568
fine as males,
if there aren't any social

00:20:29.568 --> 00:20:33.263
dominance interactions,
because a small male can still

00:20:33.263 --> 00:20:34.640
make a lot of sperm.
 

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.707
But the fitness advantage
switches to being a female when

00:20:38.707 --> 00:20:40.790
you're large,
if there aren't social

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.766
interactions,
because a big female can make a

00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:44.750
lot of eggs.
 

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.733
A lot of this analysis is done
in fish, and the default

00:20:48.733 --> 00:20:52.720
condition is pretty well
described in a lot of fish.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.092
Small males do just fine in
matings if there aren't complex

00:20:56.092 --> 00:20:59.028
social interactions,
if you don't have to fight in a

00:20:59.028 --> 00:21:01.088
dominance hierarchy to get to a
mating.

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:05.269
And big females can make
enormous numbers of eggs.

00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:07.877
A big female codfish,
a six-foot long female codfish

00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:09.308
can make 100,000,000 eggs.
 

00:21:09.308 --> 00:21:14.170
A big grouper can make
100,000,000 eggs.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.329
So, let's go through a case of
protogyny, and one of the better

00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:22.910
analyzed cases is the
blue-headed wrasse.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.608
By the way, for those of you
who are snorkelers or divers,

00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:30.977
all the members of the wrasses
and the parrot fish families are

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:36.186
sequential hermaphrodites,
and they are just about all

00:21:36.186 --> 00:21:39.305
protogynous--
so they're born as females and

00:21:39.305 --> 00:21:42.180
change to males--
and all of the members of the

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.900
grouper or sea bass family,
the Serranidae, are protandrous;

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.838
so they're born as males and
they change to females.

00:21:48.838 --> 00:21:52.584
So if you see a big lunking
grouper, it's going to be a

00:21:52.584 --> 00:21:56.674
female, and if you see a big
parrot fish, it's going to be a

00:21:56.674 --> 00:21:57.298
male.
 

00:21:57.298 --> 00:21:59.608
And some of them,
as you'll see in a minute,

00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:03.660
look rather radically different
when they change sexes,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.662
and these are fish families in
which figuring out that they

00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:11.940
were actually just two different
sexes of the same species,

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.170
rather than two different
species, took a long time,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.068
and some of the changes in
morphology and color and

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:21.390
behavior are really rather
remarkable.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.420
So in Thalassoma,
the bluehead wrasse,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.295
that's a case where they are
born as females and then they

00:22:27.295 --> 00:22:31.218
change sex and turn into males,
and when people first started

00:22:31.218 --> 00:22:35.549
doing experiments on this,
they went out and they pulled

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:39.445
the dominant male off of a reef,
and the dominant female

00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:43.108
basically started behaving as a
male within twenty-four hours,

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:46.046
and within about six weeks she
has changed color and she has

00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:48.981
changed the physiology of her
gonads and she's turned into a

00:22:48.981 --> 00:22:51.769
male and she's functioning and
producing sperm and mating

00:22:51.769 --> 00:22:53.710
perfectly successfully as a
male.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.410
It takes a little while to
change.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.720
It doesn't happen right
overnight.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.426
And actually it's a little bit
more complicated because there

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.838
are two options.
 

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:07.575
You can actually,
in this fish,

00:23:07.575 --> 00:23:10.410
be born as a female and then
turn into a male,

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.490
or you can be born as a male,
as a initial-phase male,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.380
and then turn into an adult
dominant male.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.568
And the initial-phase males are
female mimics.

00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:27.940
They make their living by
sneaking fertilizations off of

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.910
dominant males.
 

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.337
The way that sex works in this
species is that that they live

00:23:34.337 --> 00:23:37.438
on patch reefs,
or sometimes they live on a

00:23:37.438 --> 00:23:39.907
larger reef;
and you'll see in a minute that

00:23:39.907 --> 00:23:42.568
the size of the reef makes a big
difference to their lifestyle.

00:23:42.568 --> 00:23:48.227
They normally swim up to spawn
near sunset on the down current

00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:49.990
side of the reef.
 

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:56.324
When they spawn and their
fertilized eggs then are out

00:23:56.324 --> 00:23:58.454
there,
in the ocean,

00:23:58.454 --> 00:24:02.108
the current will--if they've
done it right--

00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:04.798
the current will carry the eggs
away from the reef,

00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:06.920
because if the eggs settle on
the reef,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.240
the reef is a forest of open
mouths.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.965
A coral head is basically a
whole bunch of little hydra,

00:24:12.965 --> 00:24:16.759
just waiting to grab onto
anything that falls onto it.

00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:20.374
And so the fish do their
reproduction at a time of day

00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:23.920
when planktivores will not
easily see their eggs,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.849
and in a water current that
carries the eggs away from the

00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:27.210
reef.
 

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.207
And the way they do it is that
they come up off the reef and

00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:32.900
they swim up in the water column
near the surface,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:39.221
and one of these dominant males
will swim up with a whole school

00:24:39.221 --> 00:24:43.844
of females with him,
and he will go through a dance

00:24:43.844 --> 00:24:45.984
and spawn,
and he will release his sperm

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:47.410
and they will release their
eggs.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.648
And if there is an opportunity,
one of these initial-phase

00:24:51.648 --> 00:24:55.271
males will sneak in,
and because he looks like a

00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:57.317
female,
he won't get beaten up,

00:24:57.317 --> 00:25:00.740
by the big male,
and he will release his sperm

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.578
and grab some of the
fertilization opportunity.

00:25:04.578 --> 00:25:08.449
So there's an interesting
question: how many should be

00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:13.338
initial-phase males and how many
should be initial-phase females?

00:25:13.338 --> 00:25:17.890
Well that's where the ecology
and behavior comes in.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.164
These big, lunking,
dominant, terminal-phase males

00:25:22.164 --> 00:25:26.093
can actually police a harem,
on a small reef,

00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:30.836
and they can actually police an
area which is maybe the size of

00:25:30.836 --> 00:25:35.068
this piece of furniture up here,
or down to about half that size.

00:25:35.068 --> 00:25:39.673
If it gets much bigger than
that, then the females actually

00:25:39.673 --> 00:25:42.690
are just wandering around
foraging,

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.835
looking for food,
and a female could wander down

00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:46.480
to this end,
and if there was an

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.400
initial-phase male down at this
end,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.160
he could grab copulations,
because there might be

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.578
disruptions,
as they go up at sunset,

00:25:57.578 --> 00:26:01.627
and that the number of females
would have arisen to the point

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:05.946
where the dominant male couldn't
control all of the initial-phase

00:26:05.946 --> 00:26:06.690
males.
 

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.090
So basically the idea is that
if the reef is small,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.098
these guys do well.
 

00:26:10.098 --> 00:26:14.588
The bigger the reef gets,
the better these do.

00:26:14.588 --> 00:26:17.931
And you can interpret SF either
as success in sneaking

00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:20.830
fertilizations,
or in some slightly less polite

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:21.839
terminology.
 

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.538
So this is some field data from
Panama, and it shows you what

00:26:28.538 --> 00:26:31.288
proportion of the males are
actually initial-phase males.

00:26:31.288 --> 00:26:35.392
Remember I said that you would
expect them to do better on the

00:26:35.392 --> 00:26:39.226
large reefs, and you would
expect the dominant males to do

00:26:39.226 --> 00:26:41.108
better on the big reefs.
 

00:26:41.108 --> 00:26:44.768
And this axis down here is
1/square root of local

00:26:44.768 --> 00:26:48.994
population size;
so actually populations are

00:26:48.994 --> 00:26:54.390
getting bigger in that
direction, along this axis.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:27:00.150
So in fact if you just--the
data's fairly noisy,

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.388
the transformation down here
does tend to squeeze the data

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:06.711
together a little bit,
but there is a significant

00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:08.250
effect of reef size.
 

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.700
If you're on a small reef,
it's mostly terminal males.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.817
The larger the reef gets,
the bigger the population gets,

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:18.099
the more initial-phase males
there are.

00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:26.547
Now how do they know whether
they should be an initial-phase

00:27:26.547 --> 00:27:29.450
male or an initial-phase female?
 

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.923
These guys, remember they go
out and they live in the

00:27:34.923 --> 00:27:37.068
plankton, and then they come
back to a reef.

00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:38.861
And there they are,
they're just a tiny little

00:27:38.861 --> 00:27:41.249
fish,
and they're dropping down onto

00:27:41.249 --> 00:27:43.146
a reef,
and from their

00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:47.040
perspective--after all,
if you're just one centimeter

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.082
long,
you don't really know if you're

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:52.279
on a reef the size of this room
or on a reef the size of this

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:52.759
table.
 

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:57.837
So what cues could it use to
decide what kind of reef it's

00:27:57.837 --> 00:28:02.916
on, and is it using a genetic
cue or is it a developmental

00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:03.630
one?
 

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:11.521
Well, it's really not plausible
that this kind of switch would

00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:16.097
be purely genetic,
because if it were purely

00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:20.484
genetic, then you would be the
kind of fish that your parent

00:28:20.484 --> 00:28:22.737
was,
but you might end up in an

00:28:22.737 --> 00:28:26.500
environment where that way of
living was not appropriate,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.647
because you're being spread out
over hundreds of kilometers out

00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:32.594
there in the plankton and then
coming down on reefs of many

00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:33.608
different sizes.
 

00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:38.463
So there's some evidence that
the larvae are choosing their

00:28:38.463 --> 00:28:40.390
sex based on density.
 

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.324
If you rear them in isolation,
the juveniles are almost always

00:28:44.324 --> 00:28:46.130
differentiated as females.
 

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.818
So it's like the first one in
on the reef,

00:28:48.818 --> 00:28:50.500
the default condition is to be
a female,

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.242
and that is regardless of
whether they came off a reef

00:28:54.242 --> 00:28:58.269
with lots of primary males or
with a few primary males.

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:01.548
So it doesn't appear to be that
that's an inherited condition.

00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:05.069
But if you have them reared in
groups of three,

00:29:05.069 --> 00:29:08.820
one individual usually
differentiates as a primary

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.509
male.
 

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:14.321
So as the population size,
the cues of population size

00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:18.588
start to accumulate,
some of them become primary

00:29:18.588 --> 00:29:22.038
males rather than primary
females.

00:29:22.038 --> 00:29:26.318
So this seems to be an
environmentally sensitive,

00:29:26.318 --> 00:29:30.098
developmental strategy,
and it's probably evolved in

00:29:30.098 --> 00:29:34.174
response to variation in
reproductive success of primary

00:29:34.174 --> 00:29:37.509
males and populations of
different sizes.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:39.608
That's a fairly stringent
logical condition;

00:29:39.608 --> 00:29:42.548
and again the looking backwards
ploy is important.

00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:46.962
This would never have evolved
if the genes had always been

00:29:46.962 --> 00:29:51.221
experiencing reefs of the same
size, with similar social

00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:53.390
conditions on each reef.
 

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.855
You only get a developmental
switch like this evolving if

00:29:56.855 --> 00:30:00.320
there has been a regular
alternation of social conditions

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.230
for those young male wrasses to
encounter,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.961
and if that has been the case
for long periods of time in the

00:30:06.961 --> 00:30:09.057
past,
then the ones that have been

00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:11.739
able to adjust appropriately
will have left more

00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:14.759
grandchildren;
and that appears to be what's

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:15.818
going on here.
 

00:30:15.818 --> 00:30:18.055
So if you would like,
if you're interested in this

00:30:18.055 --> 00:30:20.108
kind of thing,
this is a good paper to get you

00:30:20.108 --> 00:30:21.250
into that literature.
 

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.247
And remember,
if you're in ISI Web of

00:30:23.247 --> 00:30:26.410
Science, you can both look
backwards and look forwards.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.266
You can look at all papers
published in 2008 that cite this

00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:32.660
paper that was published in
2006,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.674
for example,
and you can do that with any

00:30:35.674 --> 00:30:38.390
other question that you're
asking.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.858
Now, what about a case of
protandry?

00:30:41.858 --> 00:30:47.645
Well this is a case that shows
the default condition when there

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:52.220
really isn't very much
complicated social life.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.538
This is a mollusk and it lives
on the Connecticut coastline.

00:30:56.538 --> 00:30:59.019
And if you go out to
Hammonasset State Park,

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:02.650
which is up by Madison,
and you walk down the beach,

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.190
your shoes are crunching on the
shells of Crepidula fornicata;

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.146
that's basically what the beach
consists of is the shells of

00:31:10.146 --> 00:31:11.250
Crepidula fornicata.
 

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:17.523
And these guys are born as
males and grow up and change

00:31:17.523 --> 00:31:23.217
over to being females,
and they go through a stage

00:31:23.217 --> 00:31:25.890
where they're both.
 

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:30.384
And, in fact,
they have a penis that extends

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:33.105
downward,
and so the males are actually

00:31:33.105 --> 00:31:35.990
inseminating the hermaphrodites
that are in the middle,

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.567
and the hermaphrodites in the
middle are inseminating the

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:39.950
female that's on the bottom.
 

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.828
So Crepidula forms a daisy
chain as a standard part of its

00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:44.848
life history.
 

00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:49.530
This is how these things live,
and you can see the progression

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:54.519
just sitting there in one clump,
as they go through their life.

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:58.130
Okay, so the Shaw-Mohler
theorem actually tells us quite

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.200
a bit about the main questions
of sequential hermaphrodites.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.125
Remember they are:
as what sex should I be born,

00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:10.048
and at what age and size should
I change sex?

00:32:10.048 --> 00:32:13.516
And by the way,
the existence of sequential

00:32:13.516 --> 00:32:17.230
hermaphrodites leads us to
certain puzzles.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.740
There are many,
as you'll see in a minute,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.823
there are many mammals where it
would make a lot of sense to be

00:32:23.823 --> 00:32:27.328
a sequential hermaphrodite,
but evidently we don't have a

00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:30.388
reproductive system that's
flexible enough for that to have

00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:30.970
evolved.
 

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.236
And I think you'll see--but
just stick that in your memory

00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:39.565
for a few minutes,
because you're now going to see

00:32:39.565 --> 00:32:44.335
a few mammals that would make
more sense to me as sequential

00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:45.788
hermaphrodites.
 

00:32:45.788 --> 00:32:47.808
We'll get into that with the
Trivers-Willard hypothesis.

00:32:47.808 --> 00:32:51.856
So again this is Bob Trivers,
and with a guy named Willard he

00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:55.500
came up with the idea that in a
polygynous species,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.848
a low ranking female,
or a female in poor condition,

00:32:58.848 --> 00:33:01.308
should have female biased
litters or clutches,

00:33:01.308 --> 00:33:05.038
because their daughters can
always have offspring.

00:33:05.038 --> 00:33:08.318
Females in these circumstances
are the limiting sex.

00:33:08.318 --> 00:33:11.744
You do not have to be a highly
competitive female in a

00:33:11.744 --> 00:33:14.328
polygynous species to get
inseminated.

00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:18.224
There's going to be some male
that's going to get you

00:33:18.224 --> 00:33:19.048
pregnant.
 

00:33:19.048 --> 00:33:21.252
On the other hand,
high ranking females,

00:33:21.252 --> 00:33:23.626
or females in good
physiological condition,

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:26.338
should have male-biased litters
or clutches.

00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:29.460
The reason for that is that
their sons can only have

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.480
offspring if they can dominate.
 

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.539
So you're not going to invest
in a male offspring unless

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:39.894
you're pretty sure that it's
going to grow up and be able to

00:33:39.894 --> 00:33:42.108
actually win competitions.
 

00:33:42.108 --> 00:33:45.865
So the examples we'll look at
are red deer and chimpanzees,

00:33:45.865 --> 00:33:49.039
and at the end I'll mention the
German farmers.

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:51.720
Okay?
 

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.690
So in red deer on the Island of
Rhum,

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.185
in Scotland,
where Tim Clutton-Brock and

00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:03.759
Loeske Kruuk and Josephine
Pemberton and others--

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:08.590
Fiona Guinness--have studied
them now for thirty years,

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.960
they have followed many
individuals,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.416
from birth to death,
and documented their social

00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:19.387
rank and their reproductive
success and many aspects of

00:34:19.387 --> 00:34:21.518
their behavioral ecology.
 

00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:24.353
There is a great deal to be
learned from following

00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:26.900
individual organisms from birth
to death,

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.139
because the variation you then
see in their lives tells you a

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.434
great deal about the selection
pressures that are operating on

00:34:33.434 --> 00:34:33.920
them.
 

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.039
And what they observed was this.
 

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:38.396
Here over here,
on the y-axis,

00:34:38.396 --> 00:34:42.541
you've got lifetime
reproductive success of male and

00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.250
female offspring.
 

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.786
The closed circles are the
sons, and the open circles are

00:34:47.786 --> 00:34:50.971
the daughters,
and this is the social rank of

00:34:50.971 --> 00:34:54.179
the mother down here--
this is subordinate and

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:58.606
dominant--and this straight line
here is drawn just for the black

00:34:58.606 --> 00:35:00.768
dots,
for the sons.

00:35:00.768 --> 00:35:04.793
And what you can see is that
there is really not very much

00:35:04.793 --> 00:35:09.240
influence of social rank on the
lifetime reproductive success of

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.664
daughters,
but there is an influence of

00:35:11.664 --> 00:35:14.298
social rank on the lifetime
reproductive success of the

00:35:14.298 --> 00:35:14.690
sons.
 

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:28.304
Now high ranking females in red
deer do give birth to more sons

00:35:28.304 --> 00:35:30.329
than daughters.
 

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:33.659
They have a distorted sex ratio
at birth.

00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:36.389
So the question is how do the
females do that?

00:35:36.389 --> 00:35:38.771
Well they can be doing it with
sperm selection,

00:35:38.771 --> 00:35:41.722
if they could detect whether
the sperm were X or Y bearing

00:35:41.722 --> 00:35:42.239
sperm.
 

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:47.420
They could do it with selective
abortion, if somehow the

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.789
conflict between mother and
offspring has been resolved in

00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:55.050
favor of the mother.
 

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.018
Just think about it.
 

00:35:56.018 --> 00:35:58.230
There you are,
you're an embryonic red deer.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.239
You happen to be the wrong sex
for this particular mother.

00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:05.764
She has evolved to get rid of
you through abortion,

00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:07.670
if you're the wrong type.
 

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:11.380
You will try to conceal your
sex.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.324
You will not be expressing
whether you're a male or a

00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:17.829
female in the surface proteins.
 

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:19.800
So there's a puzzle here.
 

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.730
How could selective abortion
evolve?

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.596
Because there is a conflict
between parent and offspring

00:36:24.596 --> 00:36:27.722
about whether you should be able
to even detect what sex your

00:36:27.722 --> 00:36:28.400
child is.
 

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.090
We don't know.
 

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.780
What we do know is this:
Nutrias do this--

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.389
nutrias are South-American
rodents--

00:36:34.389 --> 00:36:39.284
and if you have a female nutria
who is subordinate or in low

00:36:39.284 --> 00:36:44.344
physiological condition and she
should be making mostly female

00:36:44.344 --> 00:36:46.711
offspring,
but she happens to have a

00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:51.057
mostly male brood,
she just aborts the whole thing

00:36:51.057 --> 00:36:52.949
and tries again.
 

00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:54.539
So that's what she does.
 

00:36:54.539 --> 00:37:00.159
The Seychelles warblers--so a
great place to go do fieldwork;

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:03.298
the Seychelles are just
lovely--there's a warbler that

00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:06.735
lives in the Seychelles Islands
and they control the sex of

00:37:06.735 --> 00:37:10.684
individual eggs,
and they do so--in order to

00:37:10.684 --> 00:37:14.460
have the correct sex,
there is a helper at the nest

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.737
when they--
when the baby grows up they

00:37:16.737 --> 00:37:18.900
actually have helpers at the
nest.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.876
So whole families of warblers
help to feed the next

00:37:21.876 --> 00:37:24.820
generation,
and what the mother is doing is

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.364
she's making the right kind of
egg for her ecological

00:37:28.364 --> 00:37:29.250
condition.
 

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.610
Sometimes it's helpful to have
a lot of daughters and sometimes

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.940
it's not helpful to have a lot
of daughters,

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.730
and they can control the sex.
 

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.050
We don't know how they do it.
 

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:47.550
So there is definitely sex
allocation in red deer and in

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:54.106
nutrias and in Seychelles
warblers where the sex ratio at

00:37:54.106 --> 00:38:00.429
birth is being changed in terms
of social or ecological

00:38:00.429 --> 00:38:04.512
circumstances,
and it seems to be changed

00:38:04.512 --> 00:38:05.449
appropriately.
 

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:09.230
Now with
chimpanzees--chimpanzees are

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.280
like us.
 

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.400
They have a 50:50 sex ratio at
birth,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.139
and if you don't have selective
abortion,

00:38:17.139 --> 00:38:19.829
you don't have effective sperm
selection,

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:24.090
it's hard to avoid a 50:50 sex
ratio at birth.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.199
So sex chromosomes do that for
you.

00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:32.179
However, you can still make
choices after the baby is born.

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:37.670
And this is the inter-birth
interval in months,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:43.460
over here, and this line here
is for dominant mothers,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.610
and this line here is for
sub-dominant mothers,

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:53.253
and this is about five years
and this is about seven years,

00:38:53.253 --> 00:38:54.400
up here.
 

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.780
So it's about a two-year
difference.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.333
And if a dominant mother gives
birth to a daughter,

00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:05.240
she weans that daughter,
when that daughter's about five

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.449
years of age.
 

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:10.958
But if she gives birth to a
son, she keeps him for two more

00:39:10.958 --> 00:39:11.579
years.
 

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:14.570
That is a high investment.
 

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.791
He's getting more and more
expensive to take care of and

00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:21.190
she's losing time that she could
put into another child.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.579
But because she's dominant and
she's got a son,

00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:29.438
the argument is she'll get more
grandchildren if she invests in

00:39:29.438 --> 00:39:33.199
him and really makes him into a
dominant male.

00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:36.686
On the other hand--and by the
way, this is a highly

00:39:36.686 --> 00:39:39.659
significant result here;
this one is marginally

00:39:39.659 --> 00:39:42.900
insignificant down here--
a sub-dominant mother has a bit

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.463
more of a tendency to rear her
daughters longer and her sons

00:39:46.463 --> 00:39:48.880
shorter and discard the sons
earlier.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.750
Look at what happens to them.
 

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.329
This is the survivorship.
 

00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:56.170
This is the age of the baby
here.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.750
This is the son of a dominant
mother;

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.000
so these guys over here.
 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.039
They aren't weaned until
they're seven-years-old.

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:07.295
As soon as they're weaned,
30% of them die,

00:40:07.295 --> 00:40:11.092
but the rest of them have
extremely good survival,

00:40:11.092 --> 00:40:14.889
and they in fact do better than
anybody else.

00:40:14.889 --> 00:40:19.532
By age 13 they're just the best
survivor class that there is up

00:40:19.532 --> 00:40:20.880
in this diagram.
 

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.059
Look at the sons of a
sub-dominant mother.

00:40:26.059 --> 00:40:28.039
They're these guys here.
 

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:33.657
They are--this square--they are
neglected even before they're

00:40:33.657 --> 00:40:34.500
weaned.
 

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.159
They aren't weaned until five
years.

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:41.590
So before they're weaned,
they're already doing worse,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.472
and then once they're weaned
they only have a 20% probability

00:40:45.472 --> 00:40:49.483
of becoming 13-years-old;
whereas those of a dominant

00:40:49.483 --> 00:40:53.195
mother have nearly a 70%
probability of becoming

00:40:53.195 --> 00:40:54.460
13-years-old.
 

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.054
You can see that there are
similar effects going on with

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:57.809
the daughters.
 

00:40:57.809 --> 00:40:59.630
That's a very dramatic pattern.
 

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:10.090
Now, rearing a son at all,
if you're a sub-dominant

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.987
mother,
and you're going to kind of

00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:15.079
neglect him and get rid of him
early,

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:17.179
is a very expensive thing.
 

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:21.798
So why is it that they haven't
evolved screening mechanisms,

00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:26.105
at the sperm or the zygote
stage, that respond to social

00:41:26.105 --> 00:41:26.809
rank?
 

00:41:26.809 --> 00:41:27.400
We don't know.
 

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.920
It would be very adaptive for
them to do that.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.949
And I'll now tell you about the
German farmers.

00:41:34.949 --> 00:41:39.081
Klaus Voland,
in Germany, has analyzed the

00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:45.130
demographic data sets of a set
of Northwestern German farming

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:51.280
communities from the seventeenth
and eighteenth century,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.449
through the nineteenth century.
 

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:57.768
And during this time there were
economic cycles.

00:41:57.768 --> 00:42:03.315
When times were good,
it was possible for a son to

00:42:03.315 --> 00:42:05.239
inherit a farm.
 

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:09.373
When times were bad,
the sons couldn't inherit

00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:13.782
anything, or only one son could
inherit the farm,

00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:18.559
but in bad times daughters
could still marry up.

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:22.682
And what Voland showed is that
the probability that a son or a

00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:26.467
daughter would survive to
maturity was dependent upon the

00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:29.543
economic cycle,
pretty much in the same way

00:42:29.543 --> 00:42:31.969
that we just saw for the
chimpanzees.

00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:34.322
In other words,
German farmers invested more in

00:42:34.322 --> 00:42:37.056
sons when sons could inherit,
and they invested more in

00:42:37.056 --> 00:42:38.900
daughters when daughters could
marry up,

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.920
and the degree of investment
was actually reflected in the

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.320
mortality rates of the children.
 

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.119
So it had to do with parental
neglect.

00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:53.478
So that is one case where it
does look like the

00:42:53.478 --> 00:42:57.420
Trivers-Willard hypothesis
actually works in humans.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.365
To be fair to the data,
I want to mention some of the

00:43:00.365 --> 00:43:01.159
other cases.
 

00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:04.405
There have been large-scale
studies in the United States

00:43:04.405 --> 00:43:07.059
that show that this effect is
fairly weak,

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:09.880
and there have been some other
studies in the United States

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.119
that show that this effect is
fairly strong.

00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:14.440
So the evidence is mixed on
this one.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:19.010
And I would like to emphasize
that in humans it could very

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.139
well be cultural rather than
genetic.

00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:26.610
After all, people generally do
talk about issues like this,

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.849
and they are understood within
families.

00:43:29.849 --> 00:43:33.992
So it's possible that patterns
of parenting could be culturally

00:43:33.992 --> 00:43:36.400
as well as genetically
influenced.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.684
However, what one can say is
that that's perfectly consistent

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:43.400
with the Trivers-Willard
hypothesis.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.003
It's just that it might have a
cultural rather than an

00:43:47.003 --> 00:43:48.840
evolutionary explanation.
 

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:54.054
So I think that the Shaw-Mohler
theorem is a case in which very

00:43:54.054 --> 00:43:59.101
disparate kinds of information
are being brought together and

00:43:59.101 --> 00:44:03.139
explained in the same
theoretical framework.

00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:09.764
Remember, we've looked today at
sex ratios in mites where you

00:44:09.764 --> 00:44:14.070
have incest and cannibalism
going on.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.599
We have looked at sex change in
hermaphroditic fish,

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:24.101
sequentially hermaphroditic
fish, and we have looked at the

00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:28.835
investment in offspring of the
two different sexes in red deer

00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:32.922
and in chimpanzees;
and that's really quite a range

00:44:32.922 --> 00:44:34.929
of biological information.
 

00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:37.690
If you get into the sex
allocation literature,

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:41.186
you will find hundreds of more
cases where the Shaw-Mohler

00:44:41.186 --> 00:44:42.289
theorem works.
 

00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:46.920
So it indicates that it has
captured something that's very

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.090
important about evolutionary
biology.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.289
And to remind you of that,
it's the fact that in a

00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:57.271
sexually reproducing population
every diploid adult is getting

00:44:57.271 --> 00:45:00.927
half of its genome from its
father and half of its genome

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:05.583
from its mother,
and the consequence of that is

00:45:05.583 --> 00:45:12.099
that the male and the female
paths to fitness are equivalent.

00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:17.289
So this is a very fundamental
structuring fact about much of

00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:20.280
the sexual biology of organisms.
 

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.768
In sex allocation we've seen
that there are really quite

00:45:25.768 --> 00:45:27.639
strong connections between
mating systems,

00:45:27.639 --> 00:45:29.530
social structure,
sexual selection,

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.335
population structure,
life history evolution and

00:45:32.335 --> 00:45:33.409
genetic systems.
 

00:45:33.409 --> 00:45:37.836
Let me test your understanding
of what I've said today about

00:45:37.836 --> 00:45:42.489
male and female function being
equivalent paths to fitness,

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:44.059
and about the Shaw-Mohler
theorem.

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:50.690
There is a shrimp--and you have
all probably eaten it in your

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:57.099
dinning halls--which is born
male and changes to female.

00:45:57.099 --> 00:46:01.739
And let us suppose that this
shrimp, before there was ever a

00:46:01.739 --> 00:46:05.356
fishery for it,
made the sex change when it was

00:46:05.356 --> 00:46:06.929
three-years-old.
 

00:46:06.929 --> 00:46:10.795
So when it was small it was a
male, it changed to a female at

00:46:10.795 --> 00:46:14.340
three years, and then it lived
the rest of its life as a

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.050
female.
 

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.409
Male and female function are
equivalent paths to fitness.

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:23.447
Now, we create a fishery,
and the fishery goes in and it

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:27.119
starts catching all those nice
big fat females,

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:30.626
because they're the biggest
ones, and the fishery operates

00:46:30.626 --> 00:46:34.010
long enough for there to be an
evolutionary response.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.719
What happens to the age at sex
change?

00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:42.019
Student:  It's longer.
 

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:43.170
Prof: What?
 

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:46.809
Student: It's longer.
 

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:51.581
Prof: No,
they do not spend longer as

00:46:51.581 --> 00:46:52.469
males.
 

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.530
So now you know the answer.
 

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.679
But I want to know why.
 

00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:03.990
What happens is that they
change sex at two-years,

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.360
rather than at three-years.
 

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.807
What's happened is that the
fishery has been taking away

00:47:12.807 --> 00:47:15.478
their female function,
and evolution wants them to get

00:47:15.478 --> 00:47:18.309
half of their fitness through
male function and half of it

00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:19.650
through female function.
 

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:23.483
In order to maintain that
equivalency, it has to create

00:47:23.483 --> 00:47:26.679
more space in the life through
the females.

00:47:26.679 --> 00:47:30.248
The fishery is taking away
space in the life to be female,

00:47:30.248 --> 00:47:33.253
and so the sex ratio,
the sex change shifts to an

00:47:33.253 --> 00:47:34.380
earlier point.
 

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.717
This is exactly what's
happened, and if you buy fish at

00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:40.556
A1 Fish Market,
or you have them in the dining

00:47:40.556 --> 00:47:43.530
hall,
you will get shrimp in those

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.498
fish markets that do this,
and they have responded to the

00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:49.829
human selection pressure created
by the fishery,

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:53.139
and it's changed the age and
size at which they change sex.

00:47:56.969 --> 00:47:59.860
This is actually one of the
reasons why this course is

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.860
called Principles of Evolution,
Ecology and Behavior.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.840
It's because there are examples
like this where it doesn't make

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.619
any sense to separate these
fields.

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:11.110
All of this stuff is going on,
in these examples.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.847
You have dominant behavior,
you have ecology,

00:48:14.847 --> 00:48:19.264
population density and
evolution all interacting with

00:48:19.264 --> 00:48:20.539
each other.
 

00:48:20.539 --> 00:48:25.599
Okay, so next time sexual
selection.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.156
Prof: So anyway,
to get launched on today's

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:09.943
topic, obviously we confront one
of the more formidable figures

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:14.447
on our syllabus,
a person who recently passed

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:20.099
away and who in his last years
and into the present has had a

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.940
kind of second life as a person
who in his later work didn't at

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.121
all repudiate his earlier
thoughts or indeed his earlier

00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:35.371
style,
but nevertheless did begin to

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:40.528
apply central aspects of his
thinking to ethical and

00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:42.550
political issues.
 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.440
He and a number of other
writers like,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.717
for example,
the Italian philosopher Giorgio

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:51.048
Agamben,
are the figures whom we

00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:55.230
identify with what's called
"the ethical turn"

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.295
in thinking about texts,
literature and other matters

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:02.130
that is very much of the current
moment.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.147
Hence Derrida's reputation and
the tendency of people

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:12.938
interested in theory to read him
is alive and well today,

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:19.998
but the materials that we are
reading for this sequence of

00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:24.209
lectures date back much earlier.
 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.299
The essay that you read in its
entirety for today,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.792
"Structure,
Sign and Play in the Language

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:37.215
of the Human Sciences,"
was delivered on the occasion

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:41.250
of a conference about "the
sciences of man"

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.510
at Johns Hopkins University in
1966.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.316
It was an event that was really
meant to be a kind of coronation

00:01:49.316 --> 00:01:53.382
of Claude Levi-Strauss,
whose work had burst upon the

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:56.330
American scene only a few years
earlier.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.000
Levi-Strauss was there.
 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.790
He gave a talk,
he was in the audience,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.420
and Derrida's essay was widely
taken--

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.120
far from being a coronation of
Levi-Strauss--

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.408
as a kind of dethroning of
Levi-Strauss.

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:14.158
I have to tell you that
Levi-Strauss,

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:15.960
who is still alive,
a very old man,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.619
expresses great bitterness in
his old age about what he takes

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:25.122
to be the displacement of the
importance of his own work by

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.530
what happened subsequently.
 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.834
What happened subsequently can,
I think, be traced to Derrida's

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:33.690
lecture.
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.042
One of the million
complications of thinking about

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:40.598
this lecture and about Derrida's
work in general--

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:43.250
and, for that matter,
about deconstruction--

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.437
is indeed to what extent it
really is a significant

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:52.900
departure from the work of
structuralism.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.367
There is a self-consciousness
in the thinking about structure

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:01.985
that we find in many places in
Levi-Strauss that Derrida freely

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:04.218
acknowledges in his essay.
 

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:07.811
Again and again and again he
quotes Levi-Strauss in

00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.468
confirmation of his own
arguments,

00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:14.544
only then in a way to turn on
him by pointing out that there

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:18.483
is something even in what he's
saying there that he hasn't

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:20.280
quite thought through.
 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.867
So it is not anything like,
even as one reads it in

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:29.548
retrospect, a wholesale
repudiation or even really a

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:33.770
very devastating critique of
Levi-Strauss.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.051
Derrida, I think,
freely acknowledges in this

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:41.305
essay the degree to which he is
standing on Levi-Strauss's

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:42.348
shoulders.
 

00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:46.489
In any case,
this extraordinary event in the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.650
imaginations of people thinking
about theory in the West did,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.952
however, tend to bring about a
sense of almost overnight

00:03:56.952 --> 00:04:00.550
revolution from the
preoccupation we had in the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.322
mid-sixties with structuralism
to the subsequent preoccupation

00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:10.250
we had throughout the seventies
and into the early eighties with

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.050
deconstruction.
 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.914
Derrida was,
of course, a central figure in

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:16.560
this.
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.843
He was here at Yale as a
visitor in the spring for many

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:20.329
years.
 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.019
He influenced a great many
people whose work is still

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:29.800
current throughout the United
States and elsewhere.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.473
He--after that--had a
comparable arrangement with the

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:37.500
University of California at
Irvine and his influence there

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.752
continued,
a key figure whom many of us

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:51.740
remember from his period at Yale
as a galvanizing presence.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.492
The idea that there was what
was called by one critic a

00:04:56.492 --> 00:05:01.862
"hermeneutical mafia"
at Yale arose largely from the

00:05:01.862 --> 00:05:07.410
presence of Derrida together
with our own Paul de Man and,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.281
more loosely connected with
them, Geoffrey Hartman and

00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:13.982
Harold Bloom--
and also a scholar named J.

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.083
Hillis Miller,
whose departure for the

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:19.656
University of California,
Irvine resulted also in

00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:24.684
Derrida's decision to go there
and be with Miller rather than

00:05:24.684 --> 00:05:27.028
to continue to stay here.
 

00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:31.660
That was the so-called Yale
school.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.660
It generated extraordinary
influence in some circles but,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.949
well beyond its influence,
an atmosphere of hostility

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.228
which had in many ways to do,
I think, with what might still

00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:51.536
be called "the crisis in
the humanities"

00:05:51.536 --> 00:05:56.814
as it is widely understood by
state legislators and boards of

00:05:56.814 --> 00:06:01.473
trustees as somehow or another
something needing to be

00:06:01.473 --> 00:06:03.894
overcome,
backed away from,

00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:05.910
and forgotten
&gt;

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.588
in the development of the
humanities in academia.

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:14.009
The reasons for this we can
only imply,

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.307
I think, probably,
in the context of a course of

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:20.216
this nature,
but are nevertheless

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:25.048
fascinating and will recur as we
think not just about

00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:30.622
deconstruction itself but about
the sorts of thinking that it

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:32.480
has influenced.
 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.810
Now you have now read some
Derrida.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.480
You've read all of one essay
and you've read part of another,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.031
"DiffÃ©rance,"
and you've found him very

00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.589
difficult.
 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.004
Indeed, in addition to finding
him very difficult you've

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:45.980
probably said,
"Why does he have to write

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.860
like that?"
 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.889
In other words,
"Yeah, okay.

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.377
He's difficult,
but isn't he making it more

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:52.629
difficult than it needs to
be?"

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:53.649
you say to yourself.
 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.605
"I've never seen prose
like this,"

00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:56.060
you say.
 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.040
"This is ridiculous.
 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.620
Why doesn't he just say one
thing at a time?"

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.420
you might also want to say.
 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.910
Well, of course it's all
deliberate on his part,

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.509
and the idea is that
deconstruction is,

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.098
as a thought process,
precisely a kind of evasive

00:07:15.098 --> 00:07:20.740
dance whereby one doesn't settle
for distinct positions,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.019
for any sort of idea that can
be understood as governed--

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.180
this is what "Structure,
Sign and Play"

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.334
is all about--
as governed by a blanket term,

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:35.067
what Derrida often calls a
"transcendental

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:36.610
signified."
 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.319
We'll have much more to say
about this.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.500
Derrida's prose style--its kind
of a crab-like,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.490
sideways movement around an
argument--

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.863
is meant as rigorously as it
can to avoid seeming to derive

00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:55.930
itself from some definite
concept,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.269
because, of course,
deconstruction is precisely the

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:05.478
deconstruction of the grounds
whereby we suppose our thinking

00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:10.338
can be derived from one or
another definite concept.

00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:13.721
Also--this is to be kept in
mind, and this is of course one

00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:16.870
of the key distinctions between
Derrida and de Man--

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.903
we'll have more to say about
distinctions between them on

00:08:20.903 --> 00:08:24.720
Tuesday: Derrida is not a
literary theorist.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.149
Though he sometimes does talk
about texts that we call

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:29.490
"literary,"
indeed he very often does,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.139
nevertheless Derrida's position
and the logic of that position

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.331
suggest that we can't really
reliably discriminate among

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.168
genres.
 

00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:41.307
In other words,
we can't use genre

00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:46.163
either as a blanket term;
and therefore he is one of the

00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:48.399
people--
one of the most influential

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:51.169
people in persuading us that
there's no such thing as

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:52.967
literature,
legal texts,

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:56.379
theological texts,
philosophical texts,

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:58.139
or scientific texts.
 

00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:02.201
There is discourse,
and to think about the field of

00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:05.692
texts is to think about
something which is full of

00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:06.975
difference.
 

00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:08.899
&gt;
 

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:11.400
Needless to say,
it's the central word in

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.308
Derrida,
which is nevertheless not

00:09:14.308 --> 00:09:19.936
classifiable or categorizable,
and so for that reason we can't

00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:23.890
really say Derrida is
specifically a literary

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.970
theorist.
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:30.220
Now I've been talking so far
about difficulty and confusion,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.764
but in view of the fact that
we're all in a state of tension

00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:38.985
about this--
I'm in a state of tension about

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:41.634
it too--
let me remind us that we've

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:45.437
already been doing
deconstruction and that much of

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:50.095
what's problematic in reading
Derrida really has already been

00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:51.259
explained.
 

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:55.472
Let's begin with a kind of
warm-up sheet which we can

00:09:55.472 --> 00:10:00.173
anchor in these little drawings
I've made [gestures towards

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:01.470
chalkboard].
 

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.121
Obviously, you look at these
drawings and you say,

00:10:04.121 --> 00:10:04.879
"Ah ha.
 

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:07.360
That's the vertical axis,"
right?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.426
Of course, once we get to
feminism, feminism will have

00:10:11.426 --> 00:10:15.340
certain ideas of its own about
the vertical axis.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.009
We will be getting into that
when the time comes.

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:22.061
In the meantime the Eiffel
Tower [gestures towards

00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:24.552
chalkboard]
is a wonderful way of showing

00:10:24.552 --> 00:10:28.288
the degree to which the vertical
axis is virtual.

00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:31.548
That is to say,
if you ever saw a dotted line

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.659
standing upright,
it's the Eiffel Tower.

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:35.509
There's nothing in it.
 

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:36.190
It's empty.
 

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.678
It's transparent.
 

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:42.029
Yet somehow or another,
if you're at the top of it--

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:46.027
if you're in the viewing
station at the top of the Eiffel

00:10:46.027 --> 00:10:48.460
Tower--
suddenly all of Paris is

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.250
organized at your feet.
 

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.168
That is to say,
it's a wonderful axis of

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:55.940
combination that you're looking
at.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.820
It is just there with its
landmarks,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.716
not having the same kind of
status as that which you are

00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:05.903
standing on,
but rather just in a kind of

00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:09.706
row as the key signs,
as it were, of the skyline of

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:12.190
Paris: so you get the Notre
Dame,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.450
the Arc de Triomphe and so on,
all sort of lined up in a row,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.120
and there it is.
 

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.845
Guy de Maupassant in a famous
anecdote complained rather

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:28.024
bitterly about this,
according to Roland Barthes in

00:11:28.024 --> 00:11:30.820
an essay called "The Eiffel
Tower":

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.303
Maupassant often ate at the
restaurant in the tower [up here

00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:37.658
someplace]
[gestures towards the

00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:40.091
chalkboard]
even though he didn't

00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:42.600
particularly like the food.
 

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.773
"It's the only
place," he said,

00:11:44.773 --> 00:11:47.110
"where I don't have to see
it."

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.158
In other words,
if--as Saussure says,

00:11:50.158 --> 00:11:53.145
once again--we "put both
feet squarely on the

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.340
ground" of the Eiffel
Tower,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:01.482
we're liberated from the idea
that somehow or another it's a

00:12:01.482 --> 00:12:03.668
governing presence.
 

00:12:03.668 --> 00:12:07.799
If we're actually there,
we no longer have to worry

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:12.591
about the way it organizes
everything around it into a kind

00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:15.399
of rigorous unfolding pattern.
 

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:20.469
After all, there's a very real
sense in which we infer the

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:23.759
Eiffel Tower from its
surroundings.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.230
It's built in the nineteenth
century.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.080
It's by no means causative of
the skyline of Paris.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.198
It's something that comes in
belatedly just as langue

00:12:33.198 --> 00:12:36.870
comes in belatedly with
relation to speech.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.678
The Eiffel Tower is a
virtuality that organizes

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:45.860
things, as one might say,
arbitrarily.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.894
Sort of as a reflection on
these same ideas,

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:52.070
you get the famous poem of
Wallace Stevens.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.283
I am sure you recognize this as
Stevens' "Anecdote of the

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:58.129
Jar," but I will quickly
quote to you the poem.

00:12:58.129 --> 00:13:03.779
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:09.440
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.147
The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around,

00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:14.610
no longer wild.
 

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:23.759
[As Derrida would say,
the center limits free play,

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:27.379
right?]
The jar was round upon the

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:31.610
ground
And tall and of a port in air.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.049
It took dominion everywhere.
 

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:37.710
The jar was gray and bare.
 

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.559
It did not give of bird or
bush,

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:44.350
Like nothing else in Tennessee.
 

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.764
In other words,
it is arbitrarily placed in the

00:13:47.764 --> 00:13:51.330
middle of the free play of the
natural world,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:57.629
a free play which is full of
reproductive exuberance,

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:01.791
full of a kind of joyous excess
which is part of what Derrida's

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:05.145
talking about when he talks
about what's "left

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:08.100
over": the surplusage of
the sign,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.428
the supplementarity of
the sign.

00:14:10.428 --> 00:14:14.980
There's an orgasmic element in
what Derrida has in mind,

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.047
so that when he speaks of
"the seminal adventure of

00:14:18.047 --> 00:14:20.778
the trace,"
toward the end of your essay,

00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:23.331
you want to put some pressure
on that word

00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:24.700
"seminal."
 

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.130
Well, in any case the jar is
just arbitrarily in the middle

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.562
of that, organizing everything
without participating in the

00:14:33.562 --> 00:14:35.320
nature of anything.
 

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.813
It is, in other words,
a center which is outside the

00:14:38.813 --> 00:14:42.445
structure: "a center which
is not a center,"

00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:45.460
and we'll come back to that in
a minute.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.522
Now the Twin Towers--and I
first started using this example

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:54.907
decades before 2001--
the Twin Towers have a kind of

00:14:54.907 --> 00:14:59.820
poignancy and pathos today that
they would not have had then;

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:07.451
but what they suggest is in a
way today--which overwhelms us

00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:14.178
with grief--the ephemerality of
the vertical axis.

00:15:14.178 --> 00:15:17.337
The Twin Towers had the same
function in New York that the

00:15:17.337 --> 00:15:18.889
Eiffel Tower has in Paris.
 

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:22.679
It was a wonderful place from
which to see the city,

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:26.767
a wonderful place from which to
feel that everything was

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:28.700
organized at its feet.
 

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.243
There's a very fine essay about
the Twin Towers--again,

00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:37.870
long before 2001--by Michel de
Certeau, which makes this

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.480
argument in sustained form.
 

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.980
I recommend it to you.
 

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.066
In any case,
it's another example that we

00:15:46.066 --> 00:15:52.094
can take from our experience of
the uneasy sense we may have

00:15:52.094 --> 00:15:57.815
that to infer a spatial moment
from which the irreducibly

00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:02.720
temporal nature of experience is
derived--

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.559
to infer a moment from the
fact of this experience

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:12.419
as a necessary cause of
it--

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:13.980
is always problematic.
 

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.610
It always necessarily must,
as Derrida would say,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.440
put this sense of a spatial
full presence of everything

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.750
there at once in systematic
order--

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.599
as Derrida would say,
must put that "under

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:30.590
erasure."
 

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.053
In other words,
in a certain sense you can't do

00:16:33.053 --> 00:16:33.750
without it.
 

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.779
Derrida never really claims
that you can do without it.

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:39.038
If you want to get a sense of
structure,

00:16:39.038 --> 00:16:42.350
you've got to have some sort of
inference of this nature,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.720
but at the same time it had
better be in quotes

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.878
because it is always tenuous,
ephemeral, dubious even as to

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:57.340
its existence,
and necessarily needs to be

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.580
understood in that way.
 

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.850
All right.
 

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.744
Now other ways in which we've
already been involved in the

00:17:06.744 --> 00:17:11.710
subject matter of what you've
been reading today:

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:18.065
take a look at page 921,
a couple of passages in which

00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:24.430
Derrida is quoting Levi-Strauss
on the nature of myth.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:30.838
Once having quoted you these
two passages from Levi-Strauss,

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:34.957
here's where I'll return just
for a moment to Levi-Strauss's

00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:39.353
analysis of the Oedipus myth and
show you how it is that Derrida

00:17:39.353 --> 00:17:43.051
is both benefiting from what
Levi-Strauss has said and

00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:47.170
ultimately able to criticize
Levi-Strauss's position.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.220
Bottom of the left-hand column,
page 921:

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.414
"In opposition to
epistemic discourse [that is to

00:17:55.414 --> 00:17:58.872
say,
the kind of discourse which has

00:17:58.872 --> 00:18:04.863
some principle or transcendental
signified or blanket term as its

00:18:04.863 --> 00:18:07.334
basis--
in other words,

00:18:07.334 --> 00:18:13.268
something which in a given
moment makes it possible for all

00:18:13.268 --> 00:18:18.461
knowledge to flow from it],
structural discourse on

00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:21.890
myths--mythological
discourse--

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.720
must itself be
mythomorphic.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.500
It must have the form of that
of which it speaks."

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.935
[And Derrida then says]
This is what

00:18:31.935 --> 00:18:36.042
LÃ©vi-Strauss [himself]
says in [the following passage

00:18:36.042 --> 00:18:39.453
taken from one of Levi-Strauss'
most famous books]

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:43.974
The Raw and the Cooked.
I just want to quote the end of

00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:47.740
it, the middle of the right-hand
column, still on page 921.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.487
Levi-Strauss says:
"In wanting to imitate the

00:18:51.487 --> 00:18:54.230
spontaneous movement of mythical
thought,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.690
my enterprise,
itself too brief and too long,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:05.538
has yet to yield to its demands
and respect its rhythm.

00:19:05.538 --> 00:19:10.093
Thus is this book on myths
itself and in its own way a

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:11.210
myth."
 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.820
In other words,
here is a moment when

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.665
Levi-Strauss is admitting
something about his own work

00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:22.236
which he is not admitting in his
analysis of the Oedipus myth in

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:26.443
the essay from Structural
Anthropology that you read

00:19:26.443 --> 00:19:27.750
last time.
 

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:33.544
What Levi-Strauss is saying
here is that his approach to

00:19:33.544 --> 00:19:38.180
myth is itself only a version of
the myth.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.279
That is to say,
it participates in the mythic

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:45.170
way of thinking about things.
 

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.434
It uses what in the
Structural Anthropology

00:19:48.434 --> 00:19:50.701
essay he calls
"mythemes"

00:19:50.701 --> 00:19:54.298
or "gross constituent
units" of thought.

00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:59.083
It deploys and manipulates
those gross constituent units of

00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:03.728
thought in the ways that we saw,
but notice what Levi-Strauss is

00:20:03.728 --> 00:20:06.678
saying in that essay as
opposed to the passage

00:20:06.678 --> 00:20:08.210
Derrida has just quoted.
 

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.820
He says in effect,
"This form of the myth is

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.068
scientific.
 

00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:19.416
One of the versions that I have
made use of to arrive at this

00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:22.714
scientific conclusion is,
for example,

00:20:22.714 --> 00:20:26.278
Freud's version of the Oedipus
myth.

00:20:26.278 --> 00:20:28.137
In other words,
Freud, Sophocles,

00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:31.098
all of the other versions I
have at my disposal,

00:20:31.098 --> 00:20:35.324
have equal merit as versions,
but none of them is a

00:20:35.324 --> 00:20:39.977
transcendental signified,
none of them is a blanket term,

00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:44.328
and none of them is the causal
explanation or meaning of the

00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:44.920
myth.
 

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.131
The meaning of the myth is
discoverable only in my

00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:49.180
science."
 

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.369
Now, of course,
Freud himself thought he was a

00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:56.695
scientist, and his reading of
the myth was also supposed to be

00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:57.759
scientific.
 

00:20:57.759 --> 00:21:01.608
What was Freud's reading of the
myth about?

00:21:01.608 --> 00:21:02.146
Two or one!
 

00:21:02.146 --> 00:21:03.269
&gt;
 

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:06.700
It was, in other words,
about the problem of incest,

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.636
the problem of the
over-determination of blood

00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:12.575
relations and the
under-determination of blood

00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:13.490
relations.
 

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:18.410
It was a thorough examination
of that problematic leading to

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.828
the conclusion that that's what
the myth was about.

00:21:22.828 --> 00:21:26.009
In other words,
Levi-Strauss's conclusions are

00:21:26.009 --> 00:21:28.200
already anticipated in Freud.
 

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.130
Furthermore,
what is Levi-Strauss doing?

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.690
He's denying the influence of
Freud, right?

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.799
It's my myth,
not his myth--right?--which of

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:41.779
course is precisely what happens
in the primal horde.

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:45.210
It is a perfect instance of the
Oedipus complex.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.920
Levi-Strauss is repudiating the
father and,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.673
in repudiating the father,
showing himself to fall into

00:21:52.673 --> 00:21:56.498
the very mythic pattern that
Freud had been the first to

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:57.054
analyze.
 

00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:57.750
Okay?
 

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.800
So when you say that what
you're doing is scientific in a

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.983
context of this sort,
you are making yourself

00:22:04.983 --> 00:22:06.068
vulnerable.
 

00:22:06.068 --> 00:22:10.443
The moments in this essay in
which Derrida is criticizing

00:22:10.443 --> 00:22:14.740
Levi-Strauss are those moments
in which Levi-Strauss has

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.272
unguardedly said something on
the order of "My work is

00:22:19.272 --> 00:22:22.306
scientific";
but there are lots of

00:22:22.306 --> 00:22:25.721
occasions, and he always quotes
Levi-Strauss to this

00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:28.140
effect,
when Levi-Strauss is not saying

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.586
that--
when Levi-Strauss is conceding

00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:34.382
that his work,
that is to say his viewpoint,

00:22:34.382 --> 00:22:38.390
disappears unstably into the
thing viewed.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.097
All right.
 

00:22:39.097 --> 00:22:42.499
Now also take a look
at--because we've been doing

00:22:42.499 --> 00:22:45.619
this too--
take a look at page 917,

00:22:45.619 --> 00:22:50.182
the left-hand column,
where Derrida is talking not

00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:53.598
about Levi-Strauss but about
Saussure.

00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:57.358
Here he's talking about the
nature of the sign,

00:22:57.358 --> 00:23:01.509
and he is concerned,
very much concerned,

00:23:01.509 --> 00:23:06.584
about this relationship between
the concept and the sound

00:23:06.584 --> 00:23:08.603
image--
which is to say,

00:23:08.603 --> 00:23:11.160
the signified and the
signifier--

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.006
that is the basis of the
science of Saussure:

00:23:15.006 --> 00:23:18.855
that is to say,
the relationship that's

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:24.400
involved in the pairing of
signified and signifier is the

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.356
basis,
the cornerstone,

00:23:26.356 --> 00:23:28.048
of the science of Saussure.
 

00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:30.746
So here's what,
a little more than halfway

00:23:30.746 --> 00:23:34.363
down, the left-hand column,
page 917, Derrida has to say

00:23:34.363 --> 00:23:35.349
about that.
 

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:37.615
He says:
Ã¢â¬Â¦ [T]he signification

00:23:37.615 --> 00:23:40.440
"sign"
has always been comprehended

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.171
and determined,
in its sense,

00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:48.868
as sign-of, signifier referring
to a signified,

00:23:48.868 --> 00:23:52.930
signifier different from its
signified.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.821
If one erases the radical
difference between signifier and

00:23:56.821 --> 00:24:00.376
signified,
it is the word signifier itself

00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:05.712
which ought to be abandoned as a
metaphysical concept [which is

00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:08.875
to say,
a transcendental signified:

00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:12.893
in other words,
the idea that the concept in

00:24:12.893 --> 00:24:16.358
some sense generates the
signifier--

00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:22.140
right?--which is the basis of
Saussure's thinking about this].

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.747
Here's where I come back to
that example that I already gave

00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:29.355
you with a question mark next to
it when I was talking about

00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:30.150
Saussure.
 

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.257
Suppose I think of the
relationship between

00:24:33.257 --> 00:24:36.660
"signified"
and "signifier"

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.358
as the relationship between two
terms--

00:24:40.358 --> 00:24:42.919
because after all,
one way of signifying the

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:46.015
concept "tree"
[gestures towards the board]

00:24:46.015 --> 00:24:48.157
is to write the word
"tree"

00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:50.480
and put quotation marks about
it.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.847
So if I take away the quotation
marks, all I have is the word

00:24:53.847 --> 00:24:56.150
with no indication that it's a
concept.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.736
Notice that this is now a
relationship which Jakobson

00:25:00.736 --> 00:25:04.000
would call
"metalingual."

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.702
What it suggests is that
"tree"

00:25:06.702 --> 00:25:09.880
is another word for
"arbor."

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.066
In other words,
it's a relationship not between

00:25:13.066 --> 00:25:16.944
a signified and a signifier but
between a signifier and a

00:25:16.944 --> 00:25:20.554
signifier,
so that the binarism of the

00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:25.414
relationship is broken down,
and we begin to understand the

00:25:25.414 --> 00:25:30.337
combinatory structure of speech
or writing as one signifier

00:25:30.337 --> 00:25:34.828
leading to another--
I think-- signifier:

00:25:34.828 --> 00:25:37.955
Derrida says in effect,
"Let's banish the word

00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:39.279
'signifier,'"
but he might as well say,

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.482
"Let's banish the word
'signified.'"

00:25:41.482 --> 00:25:44.657
I think a signifier,
and it triggers by

00:25:44.657 --> 00:25:48.868
association--as Saussure would
say--

00:25:48.868 --> 00:25:54.308
it triggers by association a
subsequent successive signifier,

00:25:54.308 --> 00:25:57.019
which triggers another,
which triggers another.

00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:59.317
That's what gives us,
in the language of

00:25:59.317 --> 00:26:02.384
deconstruction,
what we call "the

00:26:02.384 --> 00:26:07.394
chain," the signifying
chain: not an organizational

00:26:07.394 --> 00:26:10.948
pattern but an ever
self-replicating and

00:26:10.948 --> 00:26:16.838
self-extending pattern,
irreducibly linear and

00:26:16.838 --> 00:26:24.076
forward-progressing through a
sequence of temporal

00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:26.440
associations.
 

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.432
One of the things that happens
when you demystify the

00:26:30.432 --> 00:26:35.194
relationship between a concept
and a signifier or a sound image

00:26:35.194 --> 00:26:39.188
is that you also demystify the
relationship between a

00:26:39.188 --> 00:26:43.634
set of associations,
which exist somehow in space,

00:26:43.634 --> 00:26:46.547
and the way in which
association actually takes

00:26:46.547 --> 00:26:49.380
place,
which is necessarily in time:

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.779
in other words,
if one signifier leads to

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:56.070
another--if like history,
where there's one damn thing

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.875
after another,
speech is one damn signifier

00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:04.990
after another--
then that is actually the

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.211
nature of the associations that
Saussure has been talking about

00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.710
in the first place.
 

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.858
But it doesn't exist in a
systemic space;

00:27:13.858 --> 00:27:17.740
it exists in an unfolding time,
right?

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:23.406
These are some of the
implications of no longer being

00:27:23.406 --> 00:27:29.948
satisfied with the way in which
a sign can be understood as a

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:36.269
concept to which we attach
belatedly a signification,

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:38.618
a signifier.
 

00:27:38.618 --> 00:27:44.404
What we have is a situation in
which we find ourselves caught

00:27:44.404 --> 00:27:48.804
up in a stream of signification,
all of which is,

00:27:48.804 --> 00:27:53.207
in a certain sense,
there before we came along and

00:27:53.207 --> 00:27:55.923
are moved,
as down a stream,

00:27:55.923 --> 00:28:00.497
by the way in which one
signifier succeeds another in

00:28:00.497 --> 00:28:03.884
ways that later on,
as we take up concepts like

00:28:03.884 --> 00:28:06.868
"supplementarity"
and diffÃ©rance,

00:28:06.868 --> 00:28:13.180
we can think of a little bit
more precisely.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.734
Okay.
 

00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:19.289
So now finally then,
there's one other way in which

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:25.957
Derrida's essay from the very
outset confirms what we've been

00:28:25.957 --> 00:28:32.289
saying about the crisis of
structuralism being the need to

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:39.288
deny ordinary understandings of
genesis or cause.

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:43.219
In structuralism,
if something emerges,

00:28:43.219 --> 00:28:47.769
it emerges from between
two things.

00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:50.500
That is to say,
it's not this and it's

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.046
not this,
or it "emerges"

00:28:53.046 --> 00:28:55.529
as that which is not this,
not this.

00:28:55.529 --> 00:29:02.602
It doesn't, in other words,
derive from an antecedent

00:29:02.602 --> 00:29:06.410
single cause as an effect.
 

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:13.798
It emerges, on the other hand,
as difference within a field.

00:29:13.798 --> 00:29:18.682
Now that's what Derrida is
talking about with extraordinary

00:29:18.682 --> 00:29:24.240
intensity of complication in the
first paragraph of your essay,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.843
page 915, left column,
first paragraph:

00:29:27.843 --> 00:29:33.532
his first words uttered at the
famous conference in- at Johns

00:29:33.532 --> 00:29:35.430
Hopkins in 1966.
 

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.319
He says:
Perhaps something has occurred

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:43.384
in the history of the concept of
structure that could be called

00:29:43.384 --> 00:29:47.960
an "event"
[Ã©vÃªnement,

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.442
something which emerges,
something which is there now

00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:57.111
and wasn't there before]Ã¢â¬Â¦
That's the most problematic

00:29:57.111 --> 00:29:58.640
issue for structuralism.
 

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.664
When structuralism thinks about
how yesterday things were

00:30:01.664 --> 00:30:03.880
different from the way they are
today,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.690
it has to say:
yesterday there was a certain

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.880
synchronic cross-section of
data,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.338
and today there's a slightly
different synchronic

00:30:14.338 --> 00:30:16.068
cross-section of data.
 

00:30:16.068 --> 00:30:18.940
But structuralism is unable and
furthermore--

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.892
much more
importantly--unwilling to

00:30:21.892 --> 00:30:25.492
say anything about how
yesterday's data turned into

00:30:25.492 --> 00:30:27.896
today's data--
in other words,

00:30:27.896 --> 00:30:30.630
to say anything about
change.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.731
It sees successive
cross-sections,

00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:35.279
and it calls that
"history."

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:38.727
I am anticipating here,
and we'll come back to this in

00:30:38.727 --> 00:30:41.522
other contexts:
but it doesn't say "one

00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:45.578
thing led to another";
it says "one thing after

00:30:45.578 --> 00:30:49.799
another"--in my facetious
reference to history as I have

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.700
already given it to you.
 

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.170
Now this is what Derrida is
deliberately struggling with in

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.820
this first paragraph:
Ã¢â¬Â¦ an "event"

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.506
[quote,
unquote], if this loaded word

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:06.980
did not entail a meaning which
it is precisely the function of

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.286
structural--
or structuralist--thought to

00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:12.019
reduce or to suspect.
 

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:15.459
But let me use the term
"event"

00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:18.983
[quote, unquote]
anyway, employing it with

00:31:18.983 --> 00:31:22.509
caution and as if in quotation
marks.

00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:25.039
In this sense,
this event will have the

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:28.568
exterior form of a
rupture [that is to say,

00:31:28.568 --> 00:31:33.943
an emergence among things,
right--a rupture:

00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:39.568
the volcano parts and there you
have lava,

00:31:39.568 --> 00:31:43.318
right--an event]
and a redoubling [a

00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:47.513
redoubling in the sense that
"something has

00:31:47.513 --> 00:31:49.298
happened"].
 

00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:52.151
As Bob Dylan would say in
effect, "Something has

00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:54.288
happened, but it's not something
new.

00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:57.551
It is, in fact,
a replication of what was

00:31:57.551 --> 00:32:00.182
unbeknownst to you because,
Mr.

00:32:00.182 --> 00:32:03.000
Jones, you don't know very much
of what was,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.440
unbeknownst to you,
there always--as Derrida says--

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:15.815
already: something that emerges
but at the same time presses on

00:32:15.815 --> 00:32:22.029
us its status as having already
been there,

00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:24.858
always already been there."
 

00:32:24.858 --> 00:32:25.654
All right.
 

00:32:25.654 --> 00:32:30.426
So in all these sorts of ways,
understanding structuralism as

00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:33.450
a problematic critique of
genesis--

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:37.509
because it's still very hard to
grasp,

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:41.000
to accept the notion of things
not having been caused--

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.180
why can't we say things
were caused,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.641
just for example?--the notion
of the sign as an arbitrary

00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:54.711
relationship between a
substratum of thought which is

00:32:54.711 --> 00:33:00.465
then somehow or another hooked
onto a derivative series or a

00:33:00.465 --> 00:33:06.105
system of signifiers;
the notion of getting outside

00:33:06.105 --> 00:33:12.355
of myth and being scientific,
and the notion that we can

00:33:12.355 --> 00:33:16.910
ascribe reality to the vertical
axis--

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:22.358
all of these are ways of
questioning the integrity,

00:33:22.358 --> 00:33:27.327
the security within its skin,
of structuralism we have

00:33:27.327 --> 00:33:30.140
actually already undertaken.
 

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.523
I only want to suggest to you
with this long preamble that

00:33:34.523 --> 00:33:38.678
much of the work that lies
before us is actually in the

00:33:38.678 --> 00:33:42.140
past and we have already
accomplished it.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.896
Now "Structure,
Sign and Play"

00:33:44.896 --> 00:33:48.078
is a critique of
"structurality."

00:33:48.078 --> 00:33:51.190
It's not just a critique of
structuralism.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:57.324
It's a critique of the idea of
anything that has a center,

00:33:57.324 --> 00:34:03.890
one which is at the same time
an enabling causal principle.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.131
In other words,
I look at a structure and I say

00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:08.400
it has a center.
 

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.750
What do I mean by a center?
 

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.960
I mean a blanket term,
a guiding concept,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.047
a transcendental signified,
something that explains the

00:34:16.047 --> 00:34:19.530
nature of the structure and
something also,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.507
as Derrida says,
which allows for limited free

00:34:22.507 --> 00:34:25.978
play within the structure;
but at the same time the

00:34:25.978 --> 00:34:29.420
structure has this kind of
boundary nature.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.670
It may be amoeboid but it still
has boundaries--right?--and so

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.920
at the same time limits the free
play within the structure.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.530
That's like the New Critics
saying that a text has

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.659
structure.
 

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.949
It has something that actually
in the phenomenological

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.635
tradition is called an
"intentional

00:34:47.635 --> 00:34:48.500
structure."
 

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.969
Kant calls it
"purposiveness"--

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.445
that is to say,
the way in which the thing is

00:34:54.445 --> 00:34:58.710
organized according to some sort
of guiding pattern.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:03.893
But to speak of an intentional
structure as a center is not at

00:35:03.893 --> 00:35:08.739
all the same thing as to speak
of an intending person,

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:14.077
author, being,
or idea that brought it into

00:35:14.077 --> 00:35:18.059
existence,
because that's extraneous.

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:19.659
That's something prior.
 

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.769
That's genesis.
 

00:35:20.769 --> 00:35:22.570
That's a cause, right?
 

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.262
The intending author,
in other words,

00:35:25.262 --> 00:35:29.153
is outside, whereas we can
argue that the intentional

00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:30.949
structure is inside.
 

00:35:30.949 --> 00:35:32.340
But that's a problem.
 

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.510
How do you get from an
intending author to an

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.889
intentional structure and back?
 

00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:41.885
A center is both a center and
not a center,

00:35:41.885 --> 00:35:45.119
as Derrida maddeningly tells
us.

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:49.164
It is both that which organizes
a structure and that which isn't

00:35:49.164 --> 00:35:52.632
really qualified to organize
anything, because it's not

00:35:52.632 --> 00:35:56.380
in the structure;
it's outside the structure,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.353
something that imposes itself
from without like a cookie

00:36:00.353 --> 00:36:02.809
cutter on the structure,
right?

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:09.217
This then is an introductory
moment in Derrida's thinking

00:36:09.217 --> 00:36:11.050
about centers.
 

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:15.980
On page 916 in the lower
left-hand column,

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.976
he talks about the history of
metaphysics as a history of

00:36:20.976 --> 00:36:25.440
successive appeals to a center:
that is to say,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.309
to some idea from which
everything derives,

00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:35.909
some genesis or other that can
be understood as responsible for

00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:38.349
everything that there is.
 

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:41.179
The list is very cunningly put
together.

00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:43.050
This is bottom of the left-hand
column.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.739
It's not necessarily
chronological,

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:49.132
but at the same time it gives
you a sense of successive

00:36:49.132 --> 00:36:53.768
metaphysical philosophers
thinking about first causes,

00:36:53.768 --> 00:36:59.606
origins, and about whatever it
is that determines everything

00:36:59.606 --> 00:37:00.300
else.
 

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.186
I'll just take up the list
toward the end:

00:37:04.186 --> 00:37:07.789
"transcendentality,
consciousness,

00:37:07.789 --> 00:37:12.340
or conscience,
God, man, and so forth."

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.416
Notice that though the list
isn't strictly chronological,

00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:20.679
man nevertheless does succeed
God.

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:22.894
In other words,
he's thinking about the

00:37:22.894 --> 00:37:24.820
development of Western culture.
 

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.405
In the Middle Ages and to some
extent in the Early Modern

00:37:28.405 --> 00:37:31.030
period, we live in a theocentric
world.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:36.550
Insofar as he understands
himself as man at all,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.969
man understands himself as a
product of divine creativity,

00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:45.992
as something derived from God,
as one entity among all other

00:37:45.992 --> 00:37:50.333
entities who participate and
benefit from the divine

00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:51.440
presence.
 

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.134
But then of course,
the rise of the Enlightenment

00:37:54.134 --> 00:37:56.380
is also the rise of
anthropocentrism,

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.275
and by the time the
Enlightenment is in full cry you

00:37:59.275 --> 00:38:02.907
get everybody from Blake to Marx
to Nietzsche saying not that God

00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:06.320
invented man,
but that man invented God.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.650
Man has become the
transcendental signified.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:14.195
Everything derives now in this
historical moment from human

00:38:14.195 --> 00:38:17.485
consciousness,
and all concepts of whatever

00:38:17.485 --> 00:38:20.699
kind can be understood in that
light.

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:23.380
But then of course he says,
having said "man,"

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.550
&gt;
 

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.980
he says "and so
forth."

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.518
In other words,
something comes after man.

00:38:30.518 --> 00:38:33.949
Man is, in other words,
an historical moment.

00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:37.250
There are lots of people who
have pointed out to us that

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.746
before a certain period,
there was no such thing as man,

00:38:40.746 --> 00:38:43.170
and in a variety of quite real
senses,

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.179
after a certain moment in the
history of culture,

00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:48.300
there is also no such thing as
man.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.804
The argument Derrida is making
about the emergence of his

00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:56.425
"event"
is that a new transcendental

00:38:56.425 --> 00:39:00.768
signified has actually
substituted itself for man.

00:39:00.768 --> 00:39:04.436
In other words,
the world is no longer

00:39:04.436 --> 00:39:08.010
anthropocentric;
it's linguistic.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:12.757
Obviously, the event that
Derrida is talking about--the

00:39:12.757 --> 00:39:16.713
emergence, the rupture,
an event which makes a

00:39:16.713 --> 00:39:20.670
difference--is the emergence of
language.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:31.152
What I really want to talk
about here is something that is

00:39:31.152 --> 00:39:38.139
on page 916, the right-hand
column:

00:39:38.139 --> 00:39:41.199
The moment [of emergence--the
event,

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:43.257
in other words,
about halfway down]

00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:46.101
was that in which language
invaded the universal

00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:50.121
problematic [in other words,
that moment in which language

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:53.610
displaced the previous
transcendental signified,

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.043
which was man];
that in which,

00:39:56.043 --> 00:39:59.119
in the absence of a center or
origin,

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:02.782
everything became
discourse--provided we can agree

00:40:02.782 --> 00:40:05.007
on this word--
that is to say,

00:40:05.007 --> 00:40:09.260
when everything became a system
where the central signified,

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.469
the original or transcendental
signified,

00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:16.710
is never absolutely present
outside a system of differences.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:21.215
He's making a claim for
language while erasing

00:40:21.215 --> 00:40:21.650
it.
 

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:24.635
In other words,
he's painfully aware that

00:40:24.635 --> 00:40:27.920
language is just the new God,
the new Man.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.594
Many critiques of
deconstruction take the form of

00:40:31.594 --> 00:40:35.347
saying that deconstruction
simply instrumentalizes

00:40:35.347 --> 00:40:37.375
language,
gives it agency,

00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:40.838
and gives it consciousness as
though it were God or man and

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.690
then pretends that it isn't.
 

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.719
This is a common response to
deconstruction.

00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:47.860
Derrida is aware of it in
advance.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.449
He says in effect, "Look,
I know we're running this risk

00:40:50.449 --> 00:40:52.096
in saying everything is
language,"

00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:53.480
or,
if you will here,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.070
everything is discourse.
 

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.695
At the same time,
we are saying something

00:40:57.695 --> 00:41:01.469
different,
because hitherto we had this

00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:05.650
problem: in other words,
we had the problem of something

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.309
being part of a
structure--

00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:10.199
that is to say God is immanent
in all things,

00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:14.510
human consciousness pervades
everything that it encounters--

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.271
in other words,
something which is part of a

00:41:17.271 --> 00:41:20.869
structure but which is at the
same time outside of it.

00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:26.085
God creates the world and then
sort of, as Milton says himself,

00:41:26.085 --> 00:41:29.197
"uncircumscrib'd
withdraws,"

00:41:29.197 --> 00:41:30.039
right?
 

00:41:30.039 --> 00:41:31.320
God is not there.
 

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.543
God is the Dieu
cachÃ©:

00:41:33.543 --> 00:41:37.164
God is the hidden God who is
absent from the world and is,

00:41:37.164 --> 00:41:40.150
in effect, also the structure
of the world.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.210
The same thing can be said of
man.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:47.315
Man brings the sense of what
the world is into being and then

00:41:47.315 --> 00:41:52.760
stands aside and somehow sort of
takes it in through an aesthetic

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.250
register or in some other remote
way.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.170
Language doesn't do that.
 

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.110
Language is perpetually
immersed in itself.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.262
Derrida is claiming that
language is different in the

00:42:04.262 --> 00:42:07.659
sense that it makes no sense to
talk about it as standing

00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:09.539
outside of what's going on.
 

00:42:09.539 --> 00:42:12.440
This is an essential part of
the critique of structuralism.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.239
Language is not other
than speech;

00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:20.309
it is perpetually manifest in
speech, right?

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:23.396
It's simply a distinction that
can't be maintained,

00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:26.360
which is why he calls it an
"event."

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.940
In other words,
something of significance has

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.998
happened, Mr.
 

00:42:30.998 --> 00:42:34.090
Jones, and that is language,
right?

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.197
All right.
 

00:42:35.197 --> 00:42:39.404
So I suppose in the time
remaining and,

00:42:39.404 --> 00:42:44.938
alas, there isn't a lot of it,
we'd better ask what

00:42:44.938 --> 00:42:48.150
"language"
is.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.268
We've talked about it.
 

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:54.094
We've had a great deal to do
with it, but of course we still

00:42:54.094 --> 00:42:56.010
haven't the slightest idea what
it is.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:57.090
Soon we'll know.
 

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.635
First of all,
we'd better say,

00:42:59.635 --> 00:43:03.851
as is already clear from what
we've been quoting,

00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:07.099
language is not quite
Saussurian.

00:43:07.099 --> 00:43:10.615
That is to say,
it is not a system of signs

00:43:10.615 --> 00:43:14.885
understood as stable
relationships between a concept

00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:17.900
world and a world of signifying.
 

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:24.960
It is not a world in which
language can be understood as

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:31.510
somehow or another a means of
expressing thought.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:35.802
Deconstruction calls into
question the distinction between

00:43:35.802 --> 00:43:40.322
language and thought in calling
into question the distinction

00:43:40.322 --> 00:43:44.088
between signifier and signified,
so it's not quite

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:47.077
Saussuria--even though,
as Derrida says,

00:43:47.077 --> 00:43:51.429
it can't do without a
Saussurian vocabulary.

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:56.820
Another problem is--and also
related to the critique of

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.193
Saussure--
is that this idea that what's

00:44:01.193 --> 00:44:03.702
inward,
what is essential,

00:44:03.702 --> 00:44:08.014
is something that can be
voiced and should be

00:44:08.014 --> 00:44:11.751
voiced;
so that if I think a sign is a

00:44:11.751 --> 00:44:16.670
way of talking about the
expression of a thought,

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.849
notice that I call--if I am
Saussure--

00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:22.119
that expression a "sound
image."

00:44:22.119 --> 00:44:26.123
In other words,
language, according to Derrida,

00:44:26.123 --> 00:44:30.996
in the Saussurian tradition
seems to privilege sound over

00:44:30.996 --> 00:44:33.869
script, over what is graphic.
 

00:44:33.869 --> 00:44:40.447
He claims that this is a hidden
bias in the whole history of

00:44:40.447 --> 00:44:42.010
metaphysics.
 

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.248
Why, in other words,
should we think of language as

00:44:45.248 --> 00:44:46.480
speech, as voice?
 

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.668
Why do we think of voice--in
the sense of the divine

00:44:49.668 --> 00:44:52.304
logos,
the word: "in the

00:44:52.304 --> 00:44:57.130
beginning was the word"--
why do we think of voice as a

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.652
kind of fully present
simultaneity that is absolutely

00:45:01.652 --> 00:45:06.085
present precisely in
consciousness or wherever it is

00:45:06.085 --> 00:45:10.260
that we understand language to
derive from?

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.159
What's so special about voice?
 

00:45:12.159 --> 00:45:15.090
Why do they say all of these
terrible things about writing?

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.530
Writing is no different from
voice.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:24.320
Voice, too, is articulated
combinatorially in time.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.579
Voice, too, can be understood
as inscribed on the ear.

00:45:29.579 --> 00:45:33.635
This is a metaphor that Derrida
frequently uses,

00:45:33.635 --> 00:45:36.570
as a kind of writing on the
ear.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.375
The distinction,
which Derrida takes to be

00:45:39.375 --> 00:45:42.360
metaphysical,
that Saussure wants to make

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.050
between something primary,
something immediate and

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.768
underivative--
voice--and something merely

00:45:49.768 --> 00:45:52.775
repetitious,
merely reproductive,

00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:58.059
merely a handmaiden to voice--
namely writing--needs to be

00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:00.260
called into question.
 

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:06.059
Now this is the point at which
we need to say something about a

00:46:06.059 --> 00:46:11.672
number of key terms that Derrida
uses to sustain this sort of

00:46:11.672 --> 00:46:16.070
criticism of traditional ideas
of language.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:22.119
The first has to do with the
notion of supplementarity.

00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:23.951
A supplement,
he points out,

00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:27.612
is something that either
completes something that isn't

00:46:27.612 --> 00:46:32.090
complete or adds to something
that already is complete.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:33.380
For example, I take vitamin C.
 

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.849
I also drink a lot of orange
juice,

00:46:35.849 --> 00:46:40.077
so I've got plenty of vitamin
C, and if I take a vitamin C

00:46:40.077 --> 00:46:43.565
pill I am supplementing
something that's already

00:46:43.565 --> 00:46:46.166
complete;
but if I don't drink any orange

00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:48.206
juice,
then of course if I take a

00:46:48.206 --> 00:46:51.253
vitamin C pill I am
supplementing something that's

00:46:51.253 --> 00:46:53.550
not complete,
but either way we always call

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.280
it a supplement.
 

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.599
It's very difficult even to
keep in mind the conceptual

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:02.679
difference between these two
sorts of supplement.

00:47:02.679 --> 00:47:07.447
Now a sign traditionally
understood is self-sufficient,

00:47:07.447 --> 00:47:08.949
self-contained.
 

00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:12.373
Saussure has made it a
scientific object by saying that

00:47:12.373 --> 00:47:14.909
it's both arbitrary and
differential,

00:47:14.909 --> 00:47:19.793
but a sign understood under the
critique of deconstruction is

00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:24.760
something that is perpetually
proliferating signification,

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.860
something that doesn't stand
still,

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.925
and something that can't be
understood as self-sufficient or

00:47:30.925 --> 00:47:34.507
independent in its nature as
being both arbitrary and

00:47:34.507 --> 00:47:35.679
differential.
 

00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:40.105
It is a bleeding or spilling
into successive signs in such a

00:47:40.105 --> 00:47:43.704
way that it perpetually leaves
what Derrida calls

00:47:43.704 --> 00:47:45.429
"traces."
 

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:48.882
That is to say,
as we examine the unfolding of

00:47:48.882 --> 00:47:51.643
a speech act,
we see the way in which

00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:54.559
successive signs are
contaminated.

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.992
That's not meant to be a bad
word but suggests being

00:47:56.992 --> 00:47:58.976
influenced,
one might say,

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:04.333
in the sense of "open the
window and influenza,"

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:07.530
by those signs that precede it.
 

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:13.289
Supplementarity is a way of
understanding the simultaneously

00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:19.048
linear and ever proliferating,
ever self-complicating nature

00:48:19.048 --> 00:48:21.489
of verbal expression.
 

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:27.164
Now diffÃ©rance is
a way, among other things,

00:48:27.164 --> 00:48:33.139
of talking about the difference
between voice and writing.

00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:36.152
There is a difference between
voice and writing even though

00:48:36.152 --> 00:48:37.710
they have so much in common.
 

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.637
Voice and writing,
by the way, are not a stable

00:48:40.637 --> 00:48:41.210
binary.
 

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.268
There are no stable binaries in
Derrida.

00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:48.597
The difference between voice
and writing is that writing can

00:48:48.597 --> 00:48:54.106
give us all kinds of indication
of difference that voice can't

00:48:54.106 --> 00:48:55.190
give us.
 

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.123
Part of the interest of
misspelling

00:48:58.123 --> 00:49:02.791
diffÃ©rance,
as Derrida insists on doing,

00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:05.494
is that we can't,
in terms of voice as sound,

00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:07.889
tell the difference between
diffÃ©rance and

00:49:07.889 --> 00:49:09.110
diffÃ©rence.
 

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:13.409
Actually, one can,
slightly, but it's not a

00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:16.889
difference worth lingering over.
 

00:49:16.889 --> 00:49:19.110
DiffÃ©rance,
in other words,

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.099
with its substitution of the
a--

00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:24.898
and remember the riff in the
essay

00:49:24.898 --> 00:49:28.059
"DiffÃ©rance"
on a as a pyramid,

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:31.192
as alpha, as origin,
and as killing the king because

00:49:31.192 --> 00:49:33.614
the king,
remember, is the transcendental

00:49:33.614 --> 00:49:36.760
signified: God,
man and so forth.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.068
The riff on the a in
diffÃ©rance as all

00:49:41.068 --> 00:49:45.376
of those things is something
that we can only pick up if we

00:49:45.376 --> 00:49:50.949
understand language as writing,
because in speech these modes

00:49:50.949 --> 00:49:53.949
of difference don't register.
 

00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:58.208
DiffÃ©rence (with
an e) is simply the Saussurian

00:49:58.208 --> 00:50:01.956
linguistic system,
a system of differences

00:50:01.956 --> 00:50:05.880
understood as spatial:
that is to say,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.994
understood as available to us
as a kind of smorgasbord as we

00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:14.380
stand in front of it.
 

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.360
DiffÃ©rance
introduces the idea of

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.179
deferral and reminds us that
difference--

00:50:22.179 --> 00:50:23.900
that is to say,
our understanding of

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.101
difference,
our means of negotiating

00:50:26.101 --> 00:50:27.893
difference--
is not something that's

00:50:27.893 --> 00:50:29.960
actually done in space;
it's done in time.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.268
When I perceive a difference,
I perceive it temporally.

00:50:34.268 --> 00:50:39.617
I do not understand the
relation among signs as a

00:50:39.617 --> 00:50:41.289
simultaneity.
 

00:50:41.289 --> 00:50:43.659
I want to, if I want to pin it
down scientifically,

00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:47.469
but in the actual--as Joyce
would say--

00:50:47.469 --> 00:50:50.846
stream of consciousness,
I understand difference

00:50:50.846 --> 00:50:51.780
temporally.
 

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.409
I defer difference.
 

00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:57.489
I unfold.
 

00:50:57.489 --> 00:51:03.782
I successively negotiate
difference, and in doing that I

00:51:03.782 --> 00:51:09.159
need the concept of
diffÃ©rance.

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:13.039
All right.
 

00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:18.157
There a couple of things that I
want to say about the key moves

00:51:18.157 --> 00:51:19.230
of Derrida.
 

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.869
I will mention those next time.
 

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:27.474
I will also look over my notes
and see what I might say further

00:51:27.474 --> 00:51:31.929
about these troublesome terms
and their relation to Derrida's

00:51:31.929 --> 00:51:36.164
understanding of language so
that Tuesday our introduction

00:51:36.164 --> 00:51:40.471
will still have to do with
Derrida and then we'll move into

00:51:40.471 --> 00:51:42.699
thinking about de Man.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.940
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.287
The title of today's lecture is
"Hometown Boy,

00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:13.330
Honoring an Emperor's Roots in
Roman North Africa."

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.379
And who was that hometown boy?
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.570
We met him before;
we met him in the last lecture.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.096
His name was Lucius Septimius
Severus, and he was emperor of

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.000
Rome between 193 and 211 A.D.
 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.590
And we saw him in this
extraordinary round painting,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.392
on wood, that comes from Egypt
and is now in the museum in

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:39.272
Berlin,
that depicts Lucius Septimius

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.180
Severus with his family.
 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.248
You see Septimius Severus on
the right-hand side of the

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:44.760
screen.
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.112
You see his wife,
Julia Domna,

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:52.219
on the left,
with her famous wig and pearls,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.036
and then,
down below, their two sons,

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:58.828
Caracalla,
over here on the right,

00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:02.542
and Geta, whose face has been
erased because of the

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:06.924
damnatio memoriae that
was voted him by the Senate at

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:08.040
his death.
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.790
We learned that Julia Domna
came from Syria.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.265
She was the daughter of a
priest by the name of Bassianus,

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:21.780
and Septimius Severus came from
North Africa.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.120
He was the third Roman emperor
to be from somewhere other than

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.560
Italy.
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.095
You'll recall that Trajan and
Hadrian came from Spain,

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:31.629
Septimius Severus from North
Africa.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.190
And after he ascended to the
throne,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.631
and after he began his reign,
and with all the interesting

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.670
things that he initiated as
emperor,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.569
he was honored by his hometown,
as hometown boys often are,

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.822
and the city of Leptis Magna
was renovated quite

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:53.810
significantly during his reign.
 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.504
And it's to that renovation,
and to the history of Leptis

00:01:57.504 --> 00:02:00.010
Magna in general,
and its architecture,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.989
that I want to turn today.
 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.876
Before I do that,
however, it's important for us

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:07.519
to get a sense of this part of
the world;

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.628
this part of the world before
the Romans took over.

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:15.602
And any of you who are working
on term papers that are on works

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.490
of architecture in the
provinces,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.378
or are designing a Roman city
in anywhere other than Italy,

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.158
have definitely found out that
in order to analyze those,

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:30.210
in order to think about them
and figure out what's happening,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.550
you have to not only look at
what's going on in the center of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.958
the Empire--
that is, in Rome--and what may

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.889
have been sent from the center
out to the periphery,

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.757
but you also have to understand
what was going on in the local

00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:46.949
area in which that building was
built;

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.776
the local culture,
the civilizations that preceded

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.220
the Roman civilization.
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.997
And what's fascinating about
provincial Roman architecture is

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:58.210
the way in which those two
things come together,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.188
that is, what comes from Rome
to the frontiers,

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:07.157
but also the indigenous culture
that mixes with what comes from

00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:09.195
Rome,
to make something unique,

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.639
in the case of each of these
provinces.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.014
So it's absolutely critical for
us to understand the area that

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:19.241
we're looking at,
and in this case Roman North

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.030
Africa.
 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.055
Before the Romans got to the
northern part of Africa,

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:32.658
it was an area that was
overseen primarily by Carthage;

00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:36.596
there was a very significant
Carthaginian period in this part

00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:37.580
of the world.
 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.441
The language was neo-Punic and
Berber, before it was Latin,

00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:48.089
and neo-Punic stays on,
even when Latin becomes

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.008
important here.
 

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.716
The Greeks did have some
impact, but they didn't have as

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:57.490
strong a foothold in this
particular part of the world as

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.038
they did elsewhere.
 

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:03.957
And then eventually the area is
colonized by Rome and begins to

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:07.526
be--and Roman colonies begin to
be built here,

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:10.780
all over the northern part of
Africa.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.229
I show you here a map of the
Western Empire,

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:18.819
where we see not only places
that we've already studied--

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.576
Rome and Ostia and Pompeii--but
also down here the continent of

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:26.990
Africa; you see it here.
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.639
And the cities that we're going
to be talking about--

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.180
there were lots of Roman cities
in this part of the world,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.497
but the two that we're going to
be focusing on today are the

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:39.416
city of Timgad,
which you see over here,

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:42.199
and then the city of Leptis
Magna.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.317
And please note while the map
is on the screen that Leptis

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:48.646
Magna is right on the coast;
in fact it was an extremely

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:52.033
important sea port,
which is one of the reasons

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:56.642
that it grew to the size and
significance that it did have in

00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:57.949
ancient times.
 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.920
Timgad, a little bit further
into the mainland of North

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.750
Africa.
 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.250
And you can also see,
of course, the relationship--

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.470
when you think of Leptis Magna
as a port,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.220
you can see the relationship,
the easy relationship in a

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.240
sense,
that it had to other major

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.867
ports in Roman times,
specifically Ostia,

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:20.713
and how easy it clearly was to
send things from one place to

00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:23.463
another;
which again led to the

00:05:23.463 --> 00:05:26.329
efflorescence of Leptis Magna.
 

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:29.379
Now the reason I've chosen
these particular cities--

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.569
we're going to be talking
primarily about Leptis today--

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.004
but the reason that I've also
chosen to look at Timgad is

00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:39.132
because they make a very
interesting contrast to one

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:39.870
another.
 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.480
Both of them have
extraordinarily well-preserved

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.370
Roman remains.
 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.889
But they're interesting to play
off against one another because

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.029
the city of Leptis Magna--
and this is extremely important

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.004
in analyzing it--
the city of Leptis Magna had a

00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.259
longer Roman history.
 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.680
It was already--it too had a
Carthaginian period,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.300
but most important,
in this regard,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.958
was the fact that the Romans
began to build there already in

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.730
the first century B.C.,
as we shall see.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.528
It was built up under Augustus,
then under Hadrian;

00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:17.829
renovated under Septimius
Severus.

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:22.291
So there're not only the local
structures and buildings and

00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:25.139
customs and so on to contend
with,

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.829
but also earlier Roman
architecture,

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.709
by the time we get to the time
of Septimius Severus.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:34.391
In the case of Timgad,
the city was built entirely

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:35.519
from scratch.
 

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:40.720
There was nothing on the site
when Trajan founded the city as

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.394
a Roman colony in 100 A.D.,
and it was at that time that

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:48.209
the Romans laid out their ideal
plan.

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.000
And what we're looking at here
is a view from the air of

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.560
Timgad,
as it would have looked after

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.819
it was laid out by Trajan in
100,

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.160
as it continues to look today.
 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.721
We are looking down from the
air, and we see here one of the

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:06.346
best examples that I have been
able to show you this semester

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:09.593
of the way in which the Romans,
when they are left to their own

00:07:09.593 --> 00:07:11.345
devices,
when there are no earlier

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.819
structures that they need to
contend with,

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.151
no earlier customs on the site,
no earlier temples and the like

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.795
that they need to contend with,
this is what they do when they

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.610
build their ideal Roman city.
 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.110
And you can see it is exactly
as we described it in the

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.601
mid-fourth century B.C.
 

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:30.189
at Ostia;
that is, a castrum plan.

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:33.387
It's laid out like a military
camp -- very regular,

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.649
either rectangular or square,
as you see it here.

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:39.250
It is surrounded by city walls.
 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.423
It has the two main streets,
the cardo and the

00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:46.584
decumanus,
exactly in the center of the

00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:49.639
city, intersecting with one
another at the center of the

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.928
city,
and then right at that

00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:56.201
intersection,
as was customary for Roman town

00:07:56.201 --> 00:08:00.040
planning of this castrum
type,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.547
they have placed the forum
right at the intersection of

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.456
those two,
and you can see it here also

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:04.230
from the air.
 

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.910
The forum has a great open
rectangular space.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.910
It has a basilica.
 

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.970
It has a temple on one short
end.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.439
I'm not going to show you that
forum in any--

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:17.000
I'm not going to show it to you
at all,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.011
except for what you see here,
but it is similar to others

00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:20.980
that we've seen.
 

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.952
We can also see from the air
the theater of the city of

00:08:25.952 --> 00:08:29.543
Timgad, also taking its
customary shape,

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:34.240
and in this case again very
close to the forum.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.399
But as you look at the rest of
this from the air,

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.235
you can see again not only is
it a regular- is the whole city

00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:43.336
a regular shape,
but it has been laid out within

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:46.500
the city in very regular
insulae or blocks,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.269
with the streets very straight,
as again the Romans were wont

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:53.038
to do.
 

00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:56.296
The city of Timgad,
by the way, is located in the

00:08:56.296 --> 00:08:59.009
high plains of what is Algeria
today,

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.403
just for you to get your
bearings in terms of the modern

00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:02.450
location of this city.
 

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.100
What I hope you can also see,
from this view from the air,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.756
if you look very,
very closely at the individual

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:11.176
streets,
and especially this one right

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.066
here,
you will see--perhaps it's

00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:17.202
clearest over here--
you will see that one of the

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:19.508
ways in which this however
differs from a town like Ostia

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:22.769
and the way Ostia was laid out,
is although the general layout

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:26.258
is comparable,
the city streets are lined with

00:09:26.258 --> 00:09:26.990
columns.
 

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.350
We've talked about the fact
that colonnaded streets--

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.460
we never see colonnaded streets
in Rome or in Italy,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.850
but we do see them quite
extensively in the provinces.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.226
This is an area that is part of
the western provinces,

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:45.852
but we see them also even more
extensively in the eastern

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:47.009
provinces.
 

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:49.465
So you see this colonnaded,
this very dramatic colonnaded

00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:49.860
street.
 

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.340
And I can show you a detail of
one of the colonnaded streets of

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.907
the city of Timgad,
as it looks today,

00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:59.950
and you can see the effect that
putting those columns,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.350
the punctuation points of those
columns,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.200
along the way,
which actually adds to--

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.149
makes the vista that one sees
from one part of the street to

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:12.288
another very,
very interesting indeed;

00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:15.544
as those columns,
in a sense, march toward the

00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:18.149
arch that you see at the end
here.

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:21.971
I'm going to show you that
arch, just as the one example of

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.740
a monument in the city of Leptis
Magna .

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.269
It's very well preserved.
 

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:28.840
It's usually called the Arch of
Trajan,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.285
because Trajan was the one to
have founded this particular

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:34.714
city,
but it is almost certainly not

00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:38.095
an Arch of Trajan,
since we believe it was put up

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:40.320
in the late second century A.D.
 

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.977
But we still call it the Arch
of Trajan, because that's its

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.240
conventional name.
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.440
And I can show you a detail of
that arch, as it looks today,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.580
on the screen.
 

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.269
And I think it's interesting to
compare it to another,

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:56.168
in this case early
third-century arch,

00:10:56.168 --> 00:10:59.158
the Arch of Septimius Severus
in the Roman Forum,

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:02.681
put up to Septimius' Parthian
victories in the eastern part of

00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:07.009
the Empire,
that we looked at last time.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:08.524
And I think you'll see
immediately why I've chosen to

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:10.461
pair those two,
not only because they are

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:14.106
roughly comparable in date,
but because both of them have a

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.852
triple bay,
triple bays:

00:11:15.852 --> 00:11:19.389
a central, a very central large
arcuated bay,

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:23.210
two smaller arcuated bays,
one on either side.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.720
And since the building that you
see here we believe dates to the

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.105
late second century A.D.,
and this building is not until

00:11:31.105 --> 00:11:34.779
the early third century A.D.,
203 A.D.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:37.404
to be precise,
it is another example--I

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:41.011
mentioned this last time;
I talked about the fact that

00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:44.614
the arch in the Roman Forum,
the Arch of Septimius Severus

00:11:44.614 --> 00:11:48.289
in the Roman Forum,
is our first preserved Roman

00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:53.336
arch with a triple arcuated bay,
in Rome, but that there was an

00:11:53.336 --> 00:11:57.480
earlier example that I showed
you in the south of France,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.408
at a place called Orange,
in what is now Provence,

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:03.808
where we seem to have a
Tiberian arch --

00:12:03.808 --> 00:12:06.940
a Tiberian arch that is also
tripled bayed.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.177
So I raised the point with you
that while we usually think of

00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:14.710
ideas flowing from the center to
the periphery,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.363
this may be an instance where
certain ideas are developed

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:22.320
first in the provinces,
and then make their way to Rome.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.514
Or it is also possible that
there may have been

00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:29.889
triple-arcuated arches in Rome
that no longer survive today,

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.426
that we don't know about,
that might have been earlier

00:12:32.426 --> 00:12:33.908
than the early third century.
 

00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:36.460
But the fact that here we have
another example,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.030
in one of the provinces--a
completely different part of the

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.102
world,
but the western provinces

00:12:41.102 --> 00:12:44.447
nonetheless--
we have another example of a

00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:49.609
triple-arcuated bay arch that
was put up prior to the Arch of

00:12:49.609 --> 00:12:53.048
Septimius Severus in the Roman
Forum.

00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:57.970
So it just makes us think even
more so that this idea was

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.308
floating around the Empire
earlier,

00:13:01.308 --> 00:13:04.450
clearly, than the time of
Septimius Severus,

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:10.890
and makes it more possible that
the idea may have begun in the

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.009
provinces rather than in Rome
itself.

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:17.658
The other major difference
between this arch and the Arch

00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:20.072
of Septimius Severus,
in the Roman Forum--well there

00:13:20.072 --> 00:13:20.639
are two.
 

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:23.120
But the main one is that it
relies,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.080
for the most part,
for its effects,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.812
for its visual effects,
on its architectonic elements:

00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:33.158
on its columns,
on its niches, on its pediments.

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:35.918
The Arch of Septimius Severus
in Rome,

00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:38.370
yes, has projecting columns and
the like,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.285
but it relies for its effects
largely on the figural sculpture

00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:45.604
that decorates it;
that decorates the panels over

00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:49.198
each of the smaller bays,
the frieze, and so on and so

00:13:49.198 --> 00:13:49.809
forth.
 

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:51.190
That is not true here.
 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.399
This may have had some
sculpture.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:57.476
It probably had a
quadriga group or a group

00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:59.639
of statues on the attic.
 

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:03.288
It probably had a statue or two
in these niches.

00:14:03.288 --> 00:14:07.551
But it has no relief sculpture,
no figural relief sculpture at

00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.380
all,
and relies instead,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.758
as I said, on the architectural
elements to enliven the surface

00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:17.923
and to make it an interesting
billboard for whoever this was

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.830
put up to commemorate.
 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.942
We see, for example,
these large Corinthian columns

00:14:23.942 --> 00:14:26.750
on tall bases;
the bases are not decorated.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.352
And we also see,
if we look very carefully,

00:14:31.352 --> 00:14:35.080
that there were smaller
columns.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.284
There are capitals still
preserved on either side of the

00:14:38.284 --> 00:14:38.808
niches.
 

00:14:38.808 --> 00:14:40.850
So there were smaller columns
here as well;

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.192
an interesting contrast between
the larger columns and the

00:14:44.192 --> 00:14:45.250
smaller columns.
 

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.121
And then if you look very
closely at the pediment above,

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:52.080
you see that it is an arcuated
pediment.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.264
Sometimes these are referred to
as segmental,

00:14:55.264 --> 00:14:58.086
s-e-g-m-e-n-t-a-l,
segmental or arcuated

00:14:58.086 --> 00:14:59.100
pediments.
 

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.865
And you can see that it is not
only an arcuated pediment,

00:15:02.865 --> 00:15:05.419
but it's a broken arcuated
pediment.

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:10.308
The bottom is not complete;
it's broken on either side.

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:13.943
We've seen an increasing taste
for these broken triangular or

00:15:13.943 --> 00:15:16.668
segmental pediments in Roman
architecture,

00:15:16.668 --> 00:15:20.912
this willingness to break the
rules of traditional columnar

00:15:20.912 --> 00:15:22.009
architecture.
 

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:23.558
We see that here.
 

00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:27.734
So again, it is--the surface is
enlivened through architectural

00:15:27.734 --> 00:15:30.292
means entirely,
which is an interesting

00:15:30.292 --> 00:15:33.120
phenomenon for this part of the
world.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.923
You can also see,
I think, that the stone that is

00:15:36.923 --> 00:15:42.868
used here is a local limestone,
a wonderful tan color that goes

00:15:42.868 --> 00:15:49.048
very well with the desert area
in which this finds itself.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:51.942
So local stone used in the
so-called Arch of Titus in the

00:15:51.942 --> 00:15:52.820
city of Timgad.
 

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.765
I talked about the sand,
and there's a lot of sand in

00:15:55.765 --> 00:16:00.072
this part of the world--
this is essentially desert--and

00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:05.009
we see it especially around the
city of Leptis Magna.

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:08.797
If Timgad is in modern Algeria,
Leptis Magna is in modern

00:16:08.797 --> 00:16:11.029
Libya, Colonel Gaddafi country.
 

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:14.350
And it is an amazing site.
 

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.340
A few words about the history
of Leptis Magna prior to the

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.370
birth of Septimius Severus.
 

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.847
It too--well it was,
as I mentioned,

00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:23.840
a port city.
 

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.740
It was a Phoenician port
actually initially.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.889
Then it came under the sway of
Carthage, of the Carthaginians.

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:35.960
It had some interactions with
Greece,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.188
but again, just as this area as
a whole in this part of Africa

00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:48.259
that Leptis Magna is located in,
was known as Tripolitania.

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:53.029
And so we see the Carthaginians
holding sway.

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:56.264
We see some interactions with
Greece, but again it doesn't

00:16:56.264 --> 00:16:59.783
take as significant a foothold
here as it did in other parts of

00:16:59.783 --> 00:17:00.918
the Roman world.
 

00:17:00.918 --> 00:17:07.096
And then Rome takes over Leptis
Magna and makes it a colony,

00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:11.778
makes the area a colony;
Tripolitania is a colony.

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:15.676
And it begins to be built up,
as I mentioned to you before,

00:17:15.676 --> 00:17:19.710
already in the Late Republic
and into the Augustan period.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.153
We'll see that there was
significant Augustan

00:17:22.153 --> 00:17:24.430
architecture there that still
survives.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.240
It was then that architecture
was added to by Hadrian,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.180
or during the period of
Hadrian, during the time,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.076
during the reign of Hadrian
when there was continued

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:36.608
interest in Leptis Magna.
 

00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:41.664
And then it was built up and
renovated significantly under

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:45.818
Septimius Severus;
so in the early third century

00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:46.230
A.D.
 

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.931
It continued to thrive
throughout the third century,

00:17:48.931 --> 00:17:50.519
into the fourth century A.D.
 

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.561
But in the fifth century A.D.
 

00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:56.382
it was attacked;
a significant attack by the

00:17:56.382 --> 00:17:57.838
Vandal tribes.
 

00:17:57.838 --> 00:18:01.818
It was devastated actually
during that period.

00:18:01.818 --> 00:18:06.118
But it had a brief renaissance
under the Byzantines.

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:10.670
A Byzantine wall was added to
the city, as well as a church,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.288
during that period.
 

00:18:12.288 --> 00:18:15.726
In Medieval and Modern times
though it was essentially

00:18:15.726 --> 00:18:18.671
abandoned,
and it became a place where

00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:22.798
treasure hunters did not
hesitate to go and take stone

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:25.990
and works of sculpture away with
them.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.920
But fortunately,
because of these sands,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.180
because these sands shifted
over time,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.660
with the winds,
with the sirocco and so on,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.651
they eventually did their job
by covering over a good part of

00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.199
the city,
which was actually fortunate

00:18:40.199 --> 00:18:43.684
because it meant that everything
that hadn't already been looted

00:18:43.684 --> 00:18:46.838
by those treasure hunters was at
that point preserved.

00:18:46.838 --> 00:18:48.566
It stayed covered,
for the most part,

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:49.910
until around World War II.
 

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.851
At that time,
in the twentieth century,

00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:57.108
Tripolitania was essentially a
protectorate of Italy.

00:18:57.108 --> 00:19:00.960
And in, right at the time of
World War II,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.999
and right after World War II,
Italian archaeologists went in

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:08.857
and excavated the site,
and revealed it in the way that

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:14.730
we can experience it,
if we visit Leptis Magna today.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.387
And if we visit Leptis Magna
today, we're going to see sights

00:19:18.387 --> 00:19:19.118
like this.
 

00:19:19.118 --> 00:19:23.262
What I'm showing you is a view
from the air of the forum that

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:27.544
was put in the time of Septimius
Severus, the so-called Severan

00:19:27.544 --> 00:19:29.338
Forum of Leptis Magna.
 

00:19:29.338 --> 00:19:32.089
And you can see that this is
another one of these

00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:34.440
"bigger is better"
buildings.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.108
It's extraordinarily large.
 

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:41.025
And you can see that it is not
in the best of conditions,

00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:44.009
that much of it has fallen
down.

00:19:44.009 --> 00:19:49.781
We see extensive fragments of
columns and entablatures and

00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:55.656
arcades and so on and so forth,
strewn around the structure

00:19:55.656 --> 00:19:56.670
today.
 

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.413
But there's enough there that
we can get a quite good sense,

00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:03.333
as we shall see,
of what these buildings looked

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.730
like in antiquity.
 

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.255
If one goes to the sculpture
depot, on the site,

00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:13.009
one can also see a host of
sculpture;

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.749
despite the looting,
one can also see a host of

00:20:14.749 --> 00:20:15.960
sculpture that still survives.
 

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.468
In fact, it's interesting,
right in the center here we see

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.130
a portrait of--who is it?
 

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.478
Sorry to put you on the spot,
but having taken Roman--it's

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.250
Augustus.
 

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.509
Good, excellent.
 

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:32.858
It's the emperor Augustus,
right there in the center,

00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:35.583
which proves,
or which tends to make it

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.811
likely,
to support the point that this

00:20:38.811 --> 00:20:42.750
was an area that was built up
under Augustus,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.680
and decorated with Augustan
sculpture.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.792
We see a host of statues--men,
women, fragments of body parts,

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:55.236
including hands and arms,
as you can see over here--at

00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:56.410
the depot.
 

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.699
And this again gives us some
general sense of how heavily

00:21:00.699 --> 00:21:03.838
decorated this town was in its
heyday,

00:21:03.838 --> 00:21:06.990
with sculpture of the imperial
family surely,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:14.308
and local magistrates,
as well as gods and goddesses.

00:21:14.308 --> 00:21:19.194
This is a plan of Leptis Magna
as it would have looked in the

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:20.578
ancient period.
 

00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:22.654
If we look at it here,
we will see,

00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:26.440
number one that it is--you can
tell very well from this that it

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.309
was a port city,
and that a port was built.

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:32.019
You're seeing the Mediterranean.
 

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:36.269
Then you're seeing a tributary
of that river.

00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:39.288
And you can see,
right below that river,

00:21:39.288 --> 00:21:43.040
you can see a sort of roughly
circular area that was the port

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.450
of Leptis Magna,
not so different from the Port

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.788
of Claudius,
for example, at Portus.

00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:51.104
And then you see the rest of
the city as it was laid out from

00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:52.430
the first century B.C.
 

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.410
until, or through,
the time of Septimius Severus.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.090
And if you look very carefully
you will see a host of

00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.710
buildings.
 

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.079
The one that's right in the
uppermost part there,

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:06.028
closest to the harbor,
is the Old Forum.

00:22:06.028 --> 00:22:09.042
It's not on your Monument List,
but I'm going to show it to you

00:22:09.042 --> 00:22:09.528
briefly.
 

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.807
If you go down from that,
to the left,

00:22:11.807 --> 00:22:14.516
you will see the
theater--that's easy to pick

00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:18.578
out--the theater that was put up
during the reign of Augustus.

00:22:18.578 --> 00:22:21.922
And, to the right of the
theater, you see two circles

00:22:21.922 --> 00:22:25.844
there, that is the marketplace
that was also put up during the

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.130
age of Augustus.
 

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.146
Down here, you see a very large
bath, in the imperial bath type

00:22:32.146 --> 00:22:35.788
that was built during the reign
of Hadrian.

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.900
And then right above,
to the right of the bath,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.358
you see the forum,
as it was laid out--

00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:44.519
the forum, the basilica and the
temple,

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:50.038
as they were laid out during
the reign of Septimius Severus.

00:22:50.038 --> 00:22:52.777
And then down here,
to the left of the Hadrianic

00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:56.038
Baths, there was an arch put up
on one of the streets;

00:22:56.038 --> 00:22:59.199
an arch put up also to
Septimius Severus,

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:02.278
which we will look at together
today.

00:23:02.278 --> 00:23:04.710
I want to begin with the
Augustan remains.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.462
I'm going to show you two
Augustan buildings from Leptis

00:23:08.462 --> 00:23:09.009
Magna.
 

00:23:09.009 --> 00:23:12.010
The first is the markets,
and the second will be the

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.589
theater;
and they're very interesting in

00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:15.808
all kinds of ways.
 

00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:19.561
You see a restored view of what
the market would have looked

00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:21.470
like in the Augustan period.
 

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.842
This is a restored view that
comes from your textbook,

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:26.368
from the Ward-Perkins.
 

00:23:26.368 --> 00:23:30.807
We know that the building dated
precisely to 8 B.C.,

00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:34.549
that is, in the reign of
Augustus, 8 B.C.

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:35.710
How do we know that?
 

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.166
Because there is an inscription
on the building that

00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:43.166
interestingly enough is written
in both Latin and then has a

00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:44.930
neo-Punic translation.
 

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.460
So this is a nod,
still in the Augustan age,

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.410
to the Carthaginian segment of
the population,

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.836
who still continue to live
there, even with the Roman

00:23:54.836 --> 00:23:55.430
advent.
 

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.259
So 8 B.C.
 

00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:59.593
And as we look at this,
we know, in fact,

00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:01.109
what was built in 8 B.C.
 

00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:02.519
was only part of this.
 

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:05.584
It was the two pavilions,
the two market pavilions that

00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:07.230
you see in the center here.
 

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:12.358
This scheme of having a round
or roundish structure,

00:24:12.358 --> 00:24:16.220
either one or two pavilions in
the center of an open courtyard,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.380
is actually not special to
Leptis Magna.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.970
We know this type in Italy.
 

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.605
There are examples still
preserved, for example,

00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:24.390
in Campania.
 

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.224
I showed you one,
although we didn't discuss it

00:24:27.224 --> 00:24:30.368
in the plan of the Forum of
Pompeii, for example.

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:34.583
But so this is not--this is an
idea that probably made its way

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:39.003
from--may have made its way from
Italy to Leptis Magna in the age

00:24:39.003 --> 00:24:40.108
of Augustus.
 

00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:42.118
We see it here,
these two pavilions.

00:24:42.118 --> 00:24:44.059
But if we look at these
pavilions carefully,

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:45.640
we see some interesting
features.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.650
We see that the central element
is indeed circular.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.546
There's a circular wall here,
that has in it arcuated windows

00:24:53.546 --> 00:24:57.298
and doorways,
that pierce it and open it up.

00:24:57.298 --> 00:24:59.900
Then around it though,
interestingly enough,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.925
we see that the staircase,
the way in which the columns

00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:06.464
are arranged,
and the roof,

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:10.710
make up an octagon,
make up an octagon,

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.318
in the case of both of these
pavilions.

00:25:13.318 --> 00:25:15.602
Now that is very,
very interesting,

00:25:15.602 --> 00:25:18.756
when we talk about what happens
first and where,

00:25:18.756 --> 00:25:21.374
in Rome itself,
Campania, central Italy,

00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:23.118
or in the provinces.
 

00:25:23.118 --> 00:25:26.318
Because in this particular
instance we are seeing an

00:25:26.318 --> 00:25:27.950
octagon extremely early.
 

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:33.088
This is 8 B.C.,
the age of Augustus.

00:25:33.088 --> 00:25:35.288
We don't see the octagon used
in Rome until the age of Nero --

00:25:35.288 --> 00:25:38.078
until the Domus Transitoria,
sort of,

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:41.640
and then fully blown in the
Domus Aurea,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.019
in the octagonal room of the
Domus Aurea.

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:48.013
So is this a formulation that
begins first in the provinces,

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:50.602
and ends up in Rome,
or are again there some missing

00:25:50.602 --> 00:25:51.108
links?
 

00:25:51.108 --> 00:25:53.951
Were there octagons earlier in
Rome that have no longer

00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:54.529
survived?
 

00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:58.804
It's an interesting and almost
certainly unanswerable question,

00:25:58.804 --> 00:26:02.182
unless something new is
excavated that changes the

00:26:02.182 --> 00:26:03.009
picture.
 

00:26:03.009 --> 00:26:05.809
So for now it looks as if we
see an octagon earlier in the

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:07.528
provinces than we see it in
Rome.

00:26:07.528 --> 00:26:13.855
While the pavilions--and the
pavilions were indeed these

00:26:13.855 --> 00:26:16.038
market pavilions.
 

00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:20.049
And by the way I should mention
that there were no permanent

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:21.068
markets here.
 

00:26:21.068 --> 00:26:24.144
There were temporary stalls
that would've been set up daily

00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:26.688
between the columns,
around the pavilions and the

00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:28.118
columns in the portico.
 

00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:30.960
The open portico was not done
in 8 B.C.,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.528
it was not done in the age of
Augustus,

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:35.838
but was added under Tiberius,
Augustus' successor,

00:26:35.838 --> 00:26:41.077
between 31 and 37 A.D.,
as is indicated on your

00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:42.900
Monument List.
 

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.752
And there is a difference in
the materials that were used

00:26:45.752 --> 00:26:46.108
here.
 

00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:48.500
And the materials,
interestingly enough--

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.632
and this is very important for
our understanding of the

00:26:51.632 --> 00:26:54.298
evolution of architecture and
Leptis Magna--

00:26:54.298 --> 00:26:56.190
during this period,
the age of Augustus,

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.568
local stone was used entirely.
 

00:26:59.568 --> 00:27:03.648
They used a local sandstone and
limestone--I'll show it to you

00:27:03.648 --> 00:27:05.990
in a moment--for these
pavilions.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:11.348
And then when Tiberius added,
or when the outer area,

00:27:11.348 --> 00:27:14.108
the portico was added,
in the age of Tiberius,

00:27:14.108 --> 00:27:17.328
the columns were made out of a
grey stone,

00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:20.470
but a grey stone that was also
local.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.608
So only local stone used here.
 

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:25.278
No concrete used in this
building.

00:27:25.278 --> 00:27:30.375
This is an entirely stone
building, put up in the Augustan

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:32.608
period in Leptis Magna.
 

00:27:32.608 --> 00:27:35.056
One of the pavilions,
very well preserved,

00:27:35.056 --> 00:27:36.368
as you can see here.
 

00:27:36.368 --> 00:27:40.005
And you can see that we are
dealing again with a very

00:27:40.005 --> 00:27:44.131
attractive local sandstone or
limestone that is used for the

00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:47.300
structure,
for the central pavilions

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.150
entirely.
 

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.837
And then you can see the
contrast between the coloration

00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:55.794
of that and the grey columns,
also local stone that are used

00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:57.940
for the surrounding portico.
 

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.788
If we look at this pavilion,
we can see both the central

00:28:01.788 --> 00:28:04.940
round element that I've already
described,

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.880
with its arcuated windows and
doorways,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.140
on a tall base.
 

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.858
We can also see the columns
that surround it;

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:15.470
and you can tell very well that
these are Ionic columns.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.838
Some of them are columns;
some of them are,

00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:18.900
in a sense, piers.
 

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.079
They're wider,
and those wider ones are at the

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:24.009
corners.
 

00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:27.007
And it's interesting to see how
the architects have gotten

00:28:27.007 --> 00:28:30.005
around the fact that they have
to turn the corners in this

00:28:30.005 --> 00:28:33.002
octagon by making these wider
and making them splay out on

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:33.950
either side.
 

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:39.819
You can also see some stone
benches in between some,

00:28:39.819 --> 00:28:43.848
but not all,
of the columns here.

00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:50.875
Let me go back for a second,
just to show you also that

00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:55.818
while the columns of the
pavilions,

00:28:55.818 --> 00:29:00.019
or the macella--by the
way, that's the word in Latin,

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:03.834
m-a-c-e-l-l-a,
or macellum,

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:07.685
m-a-c-e-l-l-u-m,
in the singular--the columns,

00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:11.000
the capitals of the surrounding
portico were Corinthian,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.817
as opposed to the Ionic ones
that are used for the earlier

00:29:14.817 --> 00:29:16.089
market pavilions.
 

00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:18.170
Here's another detail;
this is the one that's on your

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.670
Monument List.
 

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.710
And although it's in black and
white,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.200
doesn't give you a sense of the
coloration of the stone,

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.971
it's useful because you can see
one of these piers that turns a

00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:30.786
corner better here,
and you can also see that there

00:29:30.786 --> 00:29:35.817
are striations that make up the
flutes of the pilasters that are

00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:40.290
located in between these
arcuated openings on the central

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.328
element.
 

00:29:41.328 --> 00:29:44.913
This is another view that shows
you the less preserved second

00:29:44.913 --> 00:29:45.568
pavilion.
 

00:29:45.568 --> 00:29:48.818
You can see here again the
color of the stone.

00:29:48.818 --> 00:29:52.759
You can see the way in which
the piers turn the corner here,

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:57.667
and get a sense of the remains,
a further sense of the remains

00:29:57.667 --> 00:30:01.288
of the Augustan marketplace from
this view.

00:30:01.288 --> 00:30:03.844
The other Augustan building,
as I mentioned,

00:30:03.844 --> 00:30:07.051
was the Theater of Leptis
Magna, and this theater again

00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:09.368
also put up in the age of
Augustus.

00:30:09.368 --> 00:30:12.943
It dates specifically to A.D.
 

00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:16.034
1 to 2;
so a very early Roman theater,

00:30:16.034 --> 00:30:18.980
and a quite well-preserved
Roman theater.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.087
And we should think of it in
connection to the other Augustan

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:25.758
Roman theaters that we saw,
for example,

00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:28.358
the Theater of Marcellus,
in Rome.

00:30:28.358 --> 00:30:32.001
This one, as we'll see,
better preserved in some of its

00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:35.240
aspects than the Theater of
Marcellus in Rome.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:41.088
If we look at the plan we see
some interesting features.

00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:43.803
We see first of all that it
corresponds extremely well to

00:30:43.803 --> 00:30:46.420
the theaters that we've seen
thus far this semester;

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.740
in that sense it's a
conventional building.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.724
I should mention that it is not
built on a hillside,

00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:54.358
in the Greek manner,
but is built on a hill of

00:30:54.358 --> 00:30:55.118
concrete.
 

00:30:55.118 --> 00:30:59.261
We're going to see that very
little concrete is used in

00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:03.326
Leptis Magna,
is used in Roman North Africa

00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:06.848
in general,
where the work is primarily of

00:31:06.848 --> 00:31:08.220
stone,
the buildings are made

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.059
primarily out of stone.
 

00:31:09.059 --> 00:31:10.500
Very little concrete.
 

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.710
But they did use it here to
create a hill,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.250
a manmade artificial hill,
out of concrete,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.038
on which they could rest the
seats of the theater,

00:31:20.038 --> 00:31:21.460
or the cavea of the
theater.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.920
The seats themselves are done
in local stone.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.782
And we can also see the other
features of the typical Roman

00:31:29.782 --> 00:31:32.970
theater: the semicircular
orchestra;

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.499
the semicircular cavea;
the division of the

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:39.664
cavea into these
cunei or wedge-shaped

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:40.410
sections.
 

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.700
We can also see that the stage
building--

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.567
we know quite a bit about the
stage building because it's

00:31:46.567 --> 00:31:49.230
extremely well preserved in a
way that the Theater of

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.920
Marcellus, of course,
is not.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.145
We see that it was made up of
these three very large niches

00:31:55.145 --> 00:31:58.317
here,
that have columns screening the

00:31:58.317 --> 00:32:00.630
inside,
following the curvature,

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.318
in fact, of those niches.
 

00:32:02.318 --> 00:32:06.223
And you can also see there are
architectural elements in the

00:32:06.223 --> 00:32:09.598
center here that seem to project
into that space.

00:32:09.598 --> 00:32:13.884
And this pretty early,
this is A.D.

00:32:13.884 --> 00:32:15.019
1 to 2.
 

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:16.881
So it does give us some
sense--when we talked about

00:32:16.881 --> 00:32:19.263
painting and we talked about the
fact that we see things in Roman

00:32:19.263 --> 00:32:21.760
painting of the Second Style--
in particular,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.038
60 B.C., 50 B.C.--that we don't
see in built architecture,

00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:31.019
and I mentioned at that time
it's conceivable that they are

00:32:31.019 --> 00:32:35.068
based on lost theatrical sets
that were made out of wood.

00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:38.222
But a building like this,
where we do have local stone

00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:41.496
used for this forest of columns
that we see inside these

00:32:41.496 --> 00:32:42.946
niches--
and I'll show it to you,

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:45.877
because it's well preserved,
in a moment--we get a sense of

00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:48.690
the kind of thing that may have
existed,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:53.244
that may have had some impact
on some of the paintings that we

00:32:53.244 --> 00:32:56.904
saw of the Second Style in
places like Pompeii and

00:32:56.904 --> 00:32:57.950
elsewhere.
 

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.759
This is also interesting,
because if you look--

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:01.868
it's hard, you can't really see
it in plan--

00:33:01.868 --> 00:33:03.848
but if you look at the very top
of the cavea,

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:06.339
the top of the cavea,
in the center,

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:09.078
was the location of a temple.
 

00:33:09.078 --> 00:33:12.750
And that temple was put up to
Ceres, the goddess Ceres,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.038
C-e-r-e-s, the goddess Ceres;
Ceres Augusta,

00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:18.900
so the Augustan version of
Ceres.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.832
And that was at the very top,
and that makes this temple a

00:33:22.832 --> 00:33:27.108
type of temple that we have not
talked about this semester,

00:33:27.108 --> 00:33:30.009
and that is what is called a
theater temple;

00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:34.680
a theater that has a temple as
an integral part of it.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.009
This is not a new idea to
Leptis Magna.

00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:41.788
We know, for example,
in Rome that the Republican

00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:44.509
general Pompey built such a
theater in Rome,

00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:47.209
a temple theater,
a theater that had a temple at

00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:48.990
the apex of the cavea.
 

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.137
It is not preserved,
although there is enough

00:33:51.137 --> 00:33:54.261
evidence and fragments and so on
for us to get a quite good sense

00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:57.078
of what it looked like,
and it was one of these.

00:33:57.078 --> 00:34:00.799
So again, ideas that seem to
have been developed in Rome

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:03.506
first are making their way,
in this case,

00:34:03.506 --> 00:34:04.858
to Leptis Magna.
 

00:34:04.858 --> 00:34:09.588
Notice that the theater at the
apex is aligned with another

00:34:09.588 --> 00:34:12.929
theater that's located down
here, a large,

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.050
possibly a larger one.
 

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:20.010
And this one seems to have been
put up to the divine Augustus,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.561
or to a number of divi,
and again purposefully aligned

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.280
with the temple at the top.
 

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.880
Here's something very
interesting.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.090
We see the porticus in
the back;

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:34.324
this porticus that we
saw, for example,

00:34:34.324 --> 00:34:38.277
at the theater in Pompeii,
the early theater in Pompeii,

00:34:38.277 --> 00:34:41.010
80 to 70 B.C.,
as you'll remember.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:44.432
We see it here,
and you can see that it is not

00:34:44.432 --> 00:34:48.010
as regular as the
porticus in Pompeii.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.762
And the reason for that is
likely because of the

00:34:50.762 --> 00:34:52.929
preexisting buildings on this
site.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.005
And this is where we see a
significant difference with the

00:34:56.005 --> 00:34:57.139
planning of Timgad.
 

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.385
Timgad, again the Romans could
just lay this out any way they

00:35:00.385 --> 00:35:03.521
wanted, because nothing was
there and they chose this ideal

00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:07.188
castrum plan;
and the theater and so on,

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:09.010
very, very regular.
 

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.518
Here they have to contend with
earlier structures.

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:16.010
They have to design their
building keeping those in mind.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.969
They certainly don't want to
destroy temples,

00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:19.750
for example,
or shrines of the locals.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.539
That would not be good
politics, so they don't.

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:25.659
And they have to build their
building with that in mind;

00:35:25.659 --> 00:35:29.369
and so we see some very unusual
shapes here.

00:35:29.369 --> 00:35:32.605
It's not what they would have
done if they could have done

00:35:32.605 --> 00:35:35.954
differently, but they had to do
it, given the reality of the

00:35:35.954 --> 00:35:36.750
situation.
 

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:42.864
This is a view of the Theater
of Augustus at Leptis Magna,

00:35:42.864 --> 00:35:45.010
as it looks today.
 

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.009
You can see once again that the
stone of choice is local stone,

00:35:49.009 --> 00:35:51.976
local limestone and sandstone,
for the columns,

00:35:51.976 --> 00:35:54.300
as well as for the
cavea;

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.530
but again the cavea
rests on a concrete foundation.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.791
And we can see again what I
described before:

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:05.007
the three great niches,
as well as these square

00:36:05.007 --> 00:36:09.059
elements, with columns,
that project into our space,

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:12.719
that give a very interesting
scenic view of columnar

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:16.105
architecture,
that again gives us an idea of

00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:19.929
perhaps some of those temporary
structures in wood,

00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:24.052
that would've had a significant
impact on Second Style Roman

00:36:24.052 --> 00:36:25.170
wall painting.
 

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.010
This is interesting.
 

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.646
This is an extremely
well-preserved inscription that

00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:34.010
comes from the Theater of Leptis
Magna, and is still preserved.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.809
And we can see here,
as in the Market of Augustus

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:42.909
that is in Latin,
but also translated into

00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:45.010
neo-Punic, below.
 

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.534
And I thought you might be
interested in hearing what it

00:36:46.534 --> 00:36:46.730
says.
 

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.478
And it says,
and I quote--and I'll do that

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:53.369
in English: "When the
father of the fatherland,

00:36:53.369 --> 00:36:55.679
Caesar Augustus,
son of the deified

00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:58.400
Caesar"--
namely Julius Caesar;

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.882
so this is again one of the
ways we know that this is an

00:37:00.882 --> 00:37:02.967
Augustan building--
"was pontifex

00:37:02.967 --> 00:37:05.858
maximus"--
that is, Chief Priest of Rome,

00:37:05.858 --> 00:37:09.356
because state and religion very
closely allied in the Roman

00:37:09.356 --> 00:37:11.663
period,
and Augustus was at one point

00:37:11.663 --> 00:37:14.840
both Chief Priest of Rome,
as well as imperator or

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.702
emperor--
when Augustus was

00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:20.228
"pontifex maximus,
vested with the tribunician

00:37:20.228 --> 00:37:22.639
power for the twenty-fourth
time,

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:25.920
being consul for the thirteenth
time,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.250
a man by the name of Annobal
Rufus,

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.764
the adorner of his
country--so he must have

00:37:31.764 --> 00:37:35.099
commissioned not only this but
other buildings as well--

00:37:35.099 --> 00:37:38.400
the adorner of his country and
lover of concord,

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.030
priest, suffete,
prefect of the sacred objects,

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:47.360
the son of Himilco Tapapius,
took care to build this at his

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.199
own expense,
and dedicated it." 

00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:53.916
So here we see a good example
of the sort of thing that we see

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:57.501
often in the provinces;
that is, buildings put up in

00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:01.009
honor of the emperors,
during the period in which they

00:38:01.009 --> 00:38:03.498
reigned,
but put up by major local

00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:06.465
benefactors,
who have significant funds at

00:38:06.465 --> 00:38:08.951
their disposal,
who want to do the same sort of

00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:11.668
thing that anyone who wants to
put their name on a building at

00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:13.666
Yale,
preserve their name for

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:18.068
posterity, their generosity,
their benefaction,

00:38:18.068 --> 00:38:22.097
for posterity;
and at the same time do good by

00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:25.344
providing the kind of amenities
that cities need,

00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:28.050
like theaters and baths and the
like.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.900
I mentioned already that
building continued apace during

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.782
the time of the emperor Hadrian,
and the main building that was

00:38:36.782 --> 00:38:41.152
added to Leptis Magna,
during the Hadrianic period,

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:44.010
was a very large bath
structure;

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.139
the second largest bath
structure preserved in Roman

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:48.059
North Africa.
 

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:51.923
And we see it in plan here:
the building block on the

00:38:51.923 --> 00:38:54.673
right, and then a view,
a fuller view,

00:38:54.673 --> 00:38:57.869
of the entire bath complex at
the left.

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:00.706
It dates to A.D.
 

00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:02.655
126 to A.D.
 

00:39:02.655 --> 00:39:03.719
127.
 

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:08.380
Just looking quickly at the
plan over here,

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.719
you can see not only the
bathing block,

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:15.436
same as we see on the right,
but also the palaestra

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:17.010
of the structure.
 

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.380
And the palaestra of the
structure should strike you as

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.750
very different from any other
palaestra that we've seen

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.800
thus far this semester.
 

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.342
It's almost shaped like a
hippodrome, although it doesn't

00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:28.019
have the hairpin shape with one
curved and one straight end,

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.110
but two curved ends.
 

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.539
In fact, it might remind you,
more than a hippodrome,

00:39:31.539 --> 00:39:35.980
of the Basilica Ulpia in the
Forum of Trajan,

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.239
with its two curved ends,
one on either side,

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.590
and columns running around the
center,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:45.239
and then two radiating apses,
up here on the right--

00:39:45.239 --> 00:39:47.670
on the uppermost part,
excuse me.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.400
So a very unusually shaped
palaestra.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.208
We've never seen a
palaestra like this

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:52.579
before.
 

00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:55.731
But perhaps even more
interesting than the shape of

00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:59.389
the structure is the way it's
off axis with the rest of the

00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:00.210
building.
 

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.735
Right? It's off axis;
it's not lined up axially and

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:09.090
symmetrically with the rest of
the building.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:13.061
The reason for that is almost
certainly the same as we saw

00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:16.059
with the porticus in the
theater,

00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:19.594
the Augustan theater,
and that is something else must

00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:23.400
have stood on the site that
forced them to design this in

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.001
such a way that it was off
center with the rest of the

00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:28.090
structure.
 

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.692
But it actually made it--it
makes it more interesting,

00:40:29.692 --> 00:40:30.599
in a sense, architecturally.
 

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:33.907
With regard to the bathing
block, that is very

00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:35.010
conventional.
 

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:39.280
You can pick out all the rooms
that we've become so accustomed

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.010
to naming in Roman bath
architecture.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.552
This is an example of the
imperial bath type that we've

00:40:45.552 --> 00:40:48.505
seen developed in Rome from the
time of Titus,

00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:52.396
up through Trajan;
the Baths of Titus and the

00:40:52.396 --> 00:40:55.820
Baths of Trajan,
the imperial bath type,

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.960
where we have the main bathing
rooms placed in a row,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:06.039
in the center of the structure,
axially related to one another.

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:10.467
What do we see at the top,
with the columns around it,

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:14.730
or the bases and then columns
above, is the what?

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.420
Natatio,
the natatio.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:26.010
The frigidarium,
tepidarium, caldarium;

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.894
caldarium here with its
radiating niches,

00:41:28.894 --> 00:41:30.010
as you can see.
 

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.949
So natatio,
frigidarium,

00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:35.233
tepidarium, caldarium, all
in succession,

00:41:35.233 --> 00:41:39.188
and then the other rooms
symmetrically arranged around

00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:42.510
them;
duplicated, mirror images of

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.010
one another on either side.
 

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.994
In this plan it doesn't show
the frigidarium as if it

00:41:47.994 --> 00:41:50.724
were triple-groin vaulted,
but most who've studied this

00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:51.940
believe that it was.
 

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.010
And I'll show you a view of
that in a moment.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.157
Before I get to that,
a view into the remains of the

00:41:59.157 --> 00:42:00.699
Baths of Hadrian today.
 

00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:05.163
And we see with the Baths of
Hadrian a very major change in

00:42:05.163 --> 00:42:09.320
terms of building stone in the
city of Leptis Magna.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.864
And that is,
while up to this point they

00:42:11.864 --> 00:42:15.097
were using entirely local stone,
all of a sudden,

00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:18.340
in the time of Hadrian--
and it's not surprising,

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.248
I suppose,
with Hadrian and his era being

00:42:21.248 --> 00:42:24.360
a time of international travel
and the like,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.141
internationalism--we see the
beginning to import marbles from

00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:35.539
all over the world for the
buildings of Leptis Magna,

00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:37.300
this being the prime example.
 

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.219
We have building stone in this
building--

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:42.000
we have some local stone in
this building,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.260
but we also have marble from
Greece,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.699
marble from Asia Minor,
and even marble from Italy,

00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:52.219
used in the Baths of Hadrian at
Leptis Magna,

00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:56.630
making it a very quite
magnificent building,

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.210
to say the least.
 

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:02.047
So this is a very significant
change in the way they are

00:43:02.047 --> 00:43:05.465
thinking about the building
materials used for the

00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:07.210
structures of Leptis.
 

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:11.313
Here is a restored view of what
scholars -- some scholars at

00:43:11.313 --> 00:43:14.860
least -- believe the
frigidarium of the Baths

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.556
of Hadrian looked like;
very similar to what we imagine

00:43:18.556 --> 00:43:21.782
that the frigidaria of
baths in Rome looked like,

00:43:21.782 --> 00:43:23.190
of the imperial type.
 

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.487
Think of the later Baths of
Caracalla that we looked at last

00:43:27.487 --> 00:43:29.907
time,
with the same triple groin

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:33.161
vaulted scheme,
supported by engaged columns on

00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:35.889
either side,
and then very heavily decorated.

00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:40.567
It could be that those who have
thought about this have been too

00:43:40.567 --> 00:43:44.947
influenced by spaces like the
frigidaria in the Baths

00:43:44.947 --> 00:43:46.210
of Caracalla.
 

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.469
Because to do this--we know
that very little concrete was

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:53.137
used in Leptis Magna to do this
kind of building at this kind of

00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:53.719
scale.
 

00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:56.313
To vault this kind of room,
at this kind of scale,

00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:58.750
you would need to use concrete
construction.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.289
So there are two possibilities
here.

00:44:00.289 --> 00:44:02.260
Either they did use it in this
building,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.195
and used it very well to create
a space that was quite

00:44:05.195 --> 00:44:07.800
comparable to what was being put
up in Rome,

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:13.010
or it may have been vaulted
somewhat differently.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.760
But those who've studied this
with some, who are very

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.143
knowledgeable about this kind of
thing, seem to believe that this

00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:20.889
was a groin-vaulted building.
 

00:44:20.889 --> 00:44:23.481
Now groin vaults can be done
out of material other than

00:44:23.481 --> 00:44:24.010
concrete.
 

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:28.900
We saw some vaulting in
Pompeii--not groin vaults but

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:34.170
regular vaults--in Pompeii that
were made out of wood.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.771
But to do it at this scale
would be near impossible,

00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:42.010
and one has to imagine that
concrete would have been used.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:47.012
So that's controversial and we
don't know for sure exactly how

00:44:47.012 --> 00:44:49.309
this building was vaulted.
 

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:53.929
Septimius Severus follows the
lead of Hadrian,

00:44:53.929 --> 00:44:58.340
or of those benefactors of
Leptis Magna building buildings

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.242
in the Hadrianic period,
by continuing to have the

00:45:03.242 --> 00:45:09.431
buildings of his renovated
hometown sheathed in imported

00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:10.670
marbles.
 

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:16.170
And in fact it could be said,
if Septimius Severus were to

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.492
boast,
as Augustus had before him,

00:45:18.492 --> 00:45:21.289
that he had transformed the
city of Leptis Magna --

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:23.349
instead of saying,
as Augustus did,

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:26.744
that he found Rome a city of
brick and left Rome a city of

00:45:26.744 --> 00:45:30.284
marble,
Septimius Severus might have

00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:36.592
said he found Leptis Magna a
city of local limestone and left

00:45:36.592 --> 00:45:41.010
Leptis Magna a city of imported
marble.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:45.786
Because from this time forth
all of the buildings that we see

00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:50.483
in the Severan city of Leptis
Magna are made out of imported

00:45:50.483 --> 00:45:51.360
marble.
 

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.030
I'm going to show you a series
of these,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.018
and I'm going to begin
first--oh excuse me--

00:45:57.018 --> 00:46:01.110
begin first with the so-called
fountain or nymphaeum of

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.646
the city of Leptis Magna,
which does indeed date to the

00:46:04.646 --> 00:46:05.559
Severan period.
 

00:46:05.559 --> 00:46:09.134
Before I show you that though,
I should mention that we know

00:46:09.134 --> 00:46:11.920
that Septimius Severus traveled
back to Leptis,

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.860
once he was emperor of Rome.
 

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.998
He was involved in,
you'll remember,

00:46:15.998 --> 00:46:18.809
that war in Parthia,
so he couldn't do it right

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:19.360
away.
 

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.099
But after the great Parthian
victory--

00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:25.000
and you'll remember the arch in
Rome,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.918
the Arch of Septimius Severus
in the Roman Forum was put up to

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.880
celebrate that Parthian victory
in 203.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.409
And in precisely that same
year, 203 A.D.,

00:46:33.409 --> 00:46:35.659
Septimius appears to have made
his way,

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:36.818
along with his wife,
Julia Domna,

00:46:36.818 --> 00:46:40.019
and his family,
to the city of Leptis Magna:

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:44.847
hometown boy comes back to
great parades and the like,

00:46:44.847 --> 00:46:45.940
for sure.
 

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:51.268
And it also jumpstarted a major
building renovation,

00:46:51.268 --> 00:46:53.918
as I've mentioned,
and although we think that the

00:46:53.918 --> 00:46:56.884
Arch of Septimius Severus,
in Leptis--and I'll show it to

00:46:56.884 --> 00:47:00.512
you today--
was put up to honor Septimius

00:47:00.512 --> 00:47:06.391
on his visit to Leptis Magna,
and probably stood in 203 when

00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:09.485
he arrived--
we date it to 203--the other

00:47:09.485 --> 00:47:12.449
buildings were begun at about
that time,

00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:15.690
and then some of them were
completed by his son,

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.159
Caracalla, after his death.
 

00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:21.610
One of the buildings that
belongs to the Severan city is

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.679
this fountain or
nymphaeum,

00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:26.190
that you find on your Monument
List;

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:31.146
the nymphaeum in Leptis
Magna, that we believe dates to

00:47:31.146 --> 00:47:31.471
A.D.
 

00:47:31.471 --> 00:47:32.039
211.
 

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:35.827
You see it here in plan,
and you can see it's located

00:47:35.827 --> 00:47:36.920
next to what?
 

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.869
What's this over here?
 

00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:45.681
Student:  The
palaestra..

00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:48.244
Prof: The
palaestra--excellent,

00:47:48.244 --> 00:47:51.563
that coffee did you good--that
palaestra over here,

00:47:51.563 --> 00:47:54.010
with its projecting convexity
here.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.405
And we see on the other side
the nymphaeum or

00:47:59.405 --> 00:48:00.570
fountain.
 

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:04.695
And you can see how very
carefully orchestrated it was in

00:48:04.695 --> 00:48:07.568
terms of making cities,
building cities,

00:48:07.568 --> 00:48:09.409
building urban areas.
 

00:48:09.409 --> 00:48:12.507
The architects have paid a
great deal of attention to

00:48:12.507 --> 00:48:15.250
exactly where they're siting
this fountain,

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:19.050
and its relationship to these
other buildings,

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.760
by playing off concavities
against convexities and so on.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.451
We can see that the plan of the
nymphaeum shows it to be

00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:28.309
a structure that had one large
central niche,

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:32.199
which we're going to see
had--or one central apse,

00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:36.286
or a niche--that had in it a
series of smaller niches for

00:48:36.286 --> 00:48:39.048
statuary;
probably images of the emperor

00:48:39.048 --> 00:48:42.315
and the imperial family,
as well as important local

00:48:42.315 --> 00:48:45.320
magistrates, as well as gods and
goddesses.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:51.344
In front of it there was what
would be the basin where the

00:48:51.344 --> 00:48:52.719
water went.
 

00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:57.960
Water would have flowed out of
the center, or out of those

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.018
niches in between the statuary,
into the basin below.

00:49:03.018 --> 00:49:05.418
And you can see the way it's
been kind of splayed off,

00:49:05.418 --> 00:49:07.228
to either side,
to give it an interesting

00:49:07.228 --> 00:49:09.309
shape, and to make it seem very
welcoming.

00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:12.416
Now why did a city like Leptis
Magna need a fountain of this

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.050
magnitude?
 

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.849
Well yes it did supply water;
it was helpful in that regard.

00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:18.539
But I think it was much more
than that.

00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:22.550
I think it was viewed as a kind
of showpiece for the city.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.025
There came a time when every
city worth its salt needed to

00:49:26.025 --> 00:49:29.380
have a showpiece like this,
an ostentatious fountain.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.842
Leptis was no exception,
and so they build such an

00:49:33.842 --> 00:49:37.757
ostentatious fountain in the
Severan period,

00:49:37.757 --> 00:49:39.579
in Leptis Magna.
 

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:42.320
Here's a view of part of it,
as it looks today--

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.159
it's actually decently well
preserved--

00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:51.043
and we can see the great niche,
or part of the great niche

00:49:51.043 --> 00:49:52.927
here,
with its great apse here,

00:49:52.927 --> 00:49:54.360
with its smaller niches for
statuary,

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.809
as I've described.
 

00:49:55.809 --> 00:49:58.425
We can also see that we are
dealing here,

00:49:58.425 --> 00:50:01.563
with regard to the walls,
with local sandstone or

00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:04.900
limestone being used for the
wall construction.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.536
But all of the columns--and you
can see a columnar scheme here

00:50:08.536 --> 00:50:11.860
on two stories,
very similar to the sort of

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.610
thing that we saw in the
theater: a display of columns,

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.449
and they go into the niches as
well,

00:50:20.449 --> 00:50:23.559
as you can see here,
in two tiers.

00:50:23.559 --> 00:50:27.431
These are made out of marble
that is brought in from Asia

00:50:27.431 --> 00:50:30.679
Minor: Asia Minor marble,
so imported marble.

00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:35.224
And we do believe that the
stone carvers who were used to

00:50:35.224 --> 00:50:38.748
carving this kind of marble,
in Asia Minor,

00:50:38.748 --> 00:50:42.860
were brought in with them to do
the carving on the spot.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.472
So one of these examples of the
use of imported marble in

00:50:47.472 --> 00:50:51.840
buildings that were put up in
Severan Leptis Magna.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.960
I mentioned that I would show
you just in passing the Old

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.800
Forum of Leptis Magna,
before we look at the Severan

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.639
Forum, just so that you know.
 

00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:02.452
It's not on your Monument List,
you're not responsible for it,

00:51:02.452 --> 00:51:05.449
although it is in Ward-Perkins
and you can read about it there.

00:51:05.449 --> 00:51:08.559
But I show it to you to make a
couple of very important points.

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:10.840
One, that there was an earlier
forum on this site.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.230
It was begun in the Late
Republic, and continued into the

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.320
Augustan period.
 

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.431
It was laid out very close to
the port, which makes a lot of

00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:19.989
sense.
 

00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:24.322
And you can see that like other
fora we've seen,

00:51:24.322 --> 00:51:28.010
it had a great open rectangular
space.

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.744
It had a basilica down here,
very similar in shape and plan

00:51:31.744 --> 00:51:35.030
to basilicas we've seen,
like the one at Pompeii.

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.237
But it's interesting both
because again it is not exactly

00:51:38.237 --> 00:51:42.353
square or rectangular in shape;
it has one side that is

00:51:42.353 --> 00:51:45.813
different from that,
that's on the diagonal,

00:51:45.813 --> 00:51:49.119
and this indicates to us once
again that likely there were

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:51.963
some remains on the site that
had to be taken into

00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:54.980
consideration when this
structure was designed.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.980
But otherwise it has a
colonnade around it.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.447
It has, in this case,
three temples on one end,

00:51:59.447 --> 00:52:02.184
which is different from what we
usually see in Rome,

00:52:02.184 --> 00:52:03.420
but not unheard of.
 

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.871
I didn't show you an example,
but we do know of triple

00:52:06.871 --> 00:52:10.128
temples in architectural spaces,
complexes in Rome,

00:52:10.128 --> 00:52:13.059
fairly early on,
already in the Republic.

00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:15.719
But we see three of them here,
and they're very instructive.

00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:18.206
One's the North Temple;
we don't know to whom that was

00:52:18.206 --> 00:52:18.768
dedicated.
 

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.777
The other is a Temple of Roma
and Augustus,

00:52:20.777 --> 00:52:22.739
which one sees in most Augustan
cities.

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:26.820
And then over here a Temple of
Liber Pater.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.260
Who was Liber Pater?
 

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.923
Well Liber Pater was a god who
was very important to this

00:52:30.923 --> 00:52:32.400
particular part of the world.
 

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.860
So this interesting coming
together of Roman gods,

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.985
local gods, are another
indication that we are dealing

00:52:39.985 --> 00:52:44.344
here with a Roman society that
is being laid on top of an

00:52:44.344 --> 00:52:47.389
earlier society,
and that the cultures,

00:52:47.389 --> 00:52:50.340
religion, architectural
practices and so on,

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.487
of them, merged together to
make a very interesting

00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:56.969
mélange,
and we see that again extremely

00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:58.789
well in this Old Forum.
 

00:52:58.789 --> 00:53:02.143
The Old Forum was replaced by
the New Forum,

00:53:02.143 --> 00:53:05.652
the new Severan Forum,
in the age of Septimius

00:53:05.652 --> 00:53:06.590
Severus.
 

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.907
And that is the single most
important building still

00:53:10.907 --> 00:53:15.396
surviving in the city
of--building complex in the city

00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:17.090
of Leptis Magna.
 

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.619
And I show you once again that
view, from the air,

00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:22.851
of the forum,
the Severan Forum,

00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:25.590
that we believe dates to 216
A.D.;

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:30.329
in fact completed by Caracalla
in 216 A.D.

00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:33.429
And now that you know a bit
more about Leptis Magna and

00:53:33.429 --> 00:53:36.561
building practice there,
I think you'll see something

00:53:36.561 --> 00:53:38.880
that you probably didn't notice
before,

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.849
when you looked at this image;
when we looked at it earlier.

00:53:41.849 --> 00:53:47.130
And that is if you look at the
actual remains of the columnar

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.668
architecture,
for example,

00:53:49.668 --> 00:53:52.679
from this forum,
you will see,

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:55.202
very quickly,
that we are dealing not with

00:53:55.202 --> 00:53:57.849
local limestone but with
imported marble.

00:53:57.849 --> 00:54:00.213
If you look at this marble,
in the foreground in

00:54:00.213 --> 00:54:03.030
particular, you can see that it
has a pink tint to it.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:08.159
That pink tint tells us that it
is granite, pink granite that we

00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:10.518
know was quarried in Egypt.
 

00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:16.144
So we are seeing marbles being
brought from all over the world,

00:54:16.144 --> 00:54:21.679
to be used in the construction
of these Severan structures.

00:54:21.679 --> 00:54:27.474
A plan of the Severan Forum in
Leptis Magna shows it to be a

00:54:27.474 --> 00:54:31.010
very interesting structure
indeed;

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.264
one that is based on earlier
models in Rome,

00:54:33.264 --> 00:54:36.516
especially the Forum of Trajan,
but one that departs from it in

00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:38.300
all kinds of interesting ways.
 

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:42.090
It's also interesting to us not
only because it tells us what--

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:45.929
or it shows us what was being
built in Severan Leptis Magna,

00:54:45.929 --> 00:54:49.056
but it also gives us some
indication of what an emperor

00:54:49.056 --> 00:54:52.010
like Septimius Severus might
have built in Rome,

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.070
if he had built a forum in Rome.
 

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:57.541
You'll remember that I told the
last great imperial forum in

00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:00.836
Rome was the Forum of Trajan,
and that there was no other

00:55:00.836 --> 00:55:02.719
forum built later than that.
 

00:55:02.719 --> 00:55:06.735
But what if--you know,
the what if--what if Septimius

00:55:06.735 --> 00:55:10.286
Severus had built a forum and
basilica in Rome,

00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:12.989
what would it have looked like?
 

00:55:12.989 --> 00:55:15.519
Well maybe it would've looked
something like this,

00:55:15.519 --> 00:55:17.791
at least in plan,
but almost certainly not in

00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:18.980
building materials.
 

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.083
As we look at it here,
we see that it is conventional

00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:24.331
in that--
it's very large in scale,

00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:26.416
by the way--
it's conventional in that it

00:55:26.416 --> 00:55:28.170
has one great open rectangular
space,

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.327
surrounded by columns,
with a temple put up against

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:34.199
one of the short walls--
in fact pushed up against one

00:55:34.199 --> 00:55:36.990
of the short walls--
dominating the space in front

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.449
of it.
 

00:55:37.449 --> 00:55:40.072
If we look quickly at the plan
of the temple,

00:55:40.072 --> 00:55:42.516
we will see it's fairly
conventional also:

00:55:42.516 --> 00:55:45.409
plain back wall;
single cella, in this case;

00:55:45.409 --> 00:55:48.340
freestanding columns in the
porch;

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.429
deep porch;
single staircase;

00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:51.880
façade orientation.
 

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.813
So very much in keeping with
what we've seen throughout the

00:55:54.813 --> 00:55:56.130
course of this semester.
 

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.177
You'll notice also on this side
of the structure,

00:55:59.177 --> 00:56:02.670
the southern side of the
structure, a series of shops or

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.940
tabernae.
 

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:08.010
We've seen that in forum design
before.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.652
Think of the Forum of Julius
Caesar where they were placed in

00:56:10.652 --> 00:56:11.929
exactly that same position.
 

00:56:11.929 --> 00:56:15.550
We see over here the basilica
of the structure.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:17.768
I'm not going to describe its
plan for the moment;

00:56:17.768 --> 00:56:19.329
we'll return to it a little bit
later.

00:56:19.329 --> 00:56:23.949
But what's interesting about it
here is the way in which it is

00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:25.010
splayed off.
 

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:30.650
It is not axially related
exactly to the forum proper.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:33.130
It moves off in a slightly
different direction.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:36.438
Would the Romans have done this
if they didn't have to?

00:56:36.438 --> 00:56:37.420
Certainly not.
 

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.331
They probably again had to
contend with some sort of

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:46.010
earlier building on the site,
which forced them to do this.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.572
But they've done something
quite extraordinary,

00:56:47.572 --> 00:56:48.320
as you can see here.
 

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.704
They wanted to make sure that
when you were standing in the

00:56:51.704 --> 00:56:53.619
forum,
and looking toward the

00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:57.222
basilica, that you wouldn't
realize that that basilica was

00:56:57.222 --> 00:56:59.119
not on axis with the forum.
 

00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:02.400
And so they've done something
extraordinarily ingenious.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.840
And what they've done is to
create this series,

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.960
this wedge-shaped series of
shops that forms the transition

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.659
between the forum and the
basilica,

00:57:11.659 --> 00:57:15.199
that's narrow on one end and is
wider on the other end.

00:57:15.199 --> 00:57:18.686
And when you stand and look at
it, from the inside--and I'll

00:57:18.686 --> 00:57:21.581
show you an image in a
moment--it looks like it is

00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:23.429
completely straight;
which it is,

00:57:23.429 --> 00:57:24.900
in the front,
but you can't tell what lies

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.260
behind.
 

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.869
So when you're standing there,
you do get the sense,

00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:33.518
and as you move from the forum,
into this apsed area here,

00:57:33.518 --> 00:57:35.722
through columns,
into the columns of the

00:57:35.722 --> 00:57:38.427
basilica--
which you can do--you don't

00:57:38.427 --> 00:57:42.936
realize that the basilica is
really off axis with the rest of

00:57:42.936 --> 00:57:44.139
the building.
 

00:57:44.139 --> 00:57:49.688
So some ingenious work here on
the part of the designers of the

00:57:49.688 --> 00:57:51.119
Severan Forum.
 

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:55.000
I'll come back to the basilica
again momentarily.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.510
But for the moment,
just to stick with the forum

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:00.608
proper, we are looking here at
one of the entranceways into

00:58:00.608 --> 00:58:01.409
that forum.
 

00:58:01.409 --> 00:58:04.300
And you can see,
even in black and white,

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.960
that we're dealing with local
sandstone or limestone for the

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.266
walls,
but with imported marble for

00:58:11.266 --> 00:58:14.800
the doorways and for the
pilasters.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.380
And if you look very carefully,
you will see that these are

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:21.836
capitals that are unlike any
capitals we've seen thus far

00:58:21.836 --> 00:58:24.086
this semester,
and underscore again this

00:58:24.086 --> 00:58:25.639
interesting merging of
influences,

00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:29.090
not only from Rome but
elsewhere in the Roman Empire.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:34.164
We see these striated capitals
on the pilasters up above that

00:58:34.164 --> 00:58:39.070
are very similar to the sorts of
things we see in Egypt.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.608
And then if we look at these
capitals down below--and we see

00:58:41.608 --> 00:58:43.630
these capitals used extensively
in the forum;

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.650
I'll show you other examples
momentarily--

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:49.753
you will see that what we are
dealing with here are the Roman

00:58:49.753 --> 00:58:53.128
acanthus leaves at the bottom,
but growing out of those Roman

00:58:53.128 --> 00:58:54.469
acanthus leaves are lotus leaves
--

00:58:54.469 --> 00:58:57.289
lotus leaves that come from
Egypt,

00:58:57.289 --> 00:59:00.599
lotus leaves that were used in
Egyptian capitals.

00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:04.367
So this interesting merging of
Roman culture,

00:59:04.367 --> 00:59:08.134
Egyptian culture,
for this structure in Roman

00:59:08.134 --> 00:59:09.590
North Africa.
 

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:13.657
This is a view of the shops,
of that wedge-shaped section of

00:59:13.657 --> 00:59:14.210
shops.
 

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.032
We're standing in the forum,
looking back toward the

00:59:17.032 --> 00:59:19.579
basilica, about to go from one
to the other.

00:59:19.579 --> 00:59:21.851
And you can see that they are
in a straight line and that you

00:59:21.851 --> 00:59:24.347
would not be able to tell,
as you were standing in front

00:59:24.347 --> 00:59:28.351
of them,
that the forum was not axially

00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:32.460
related to the basilica next
door.

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:37.146
We can also see some remains of
statuary, columns preserved in

00:59:37.146 --> 00:59:39.958
their entirety,
as well as capitals of the same

00:59:39.958 --> 00:59:43.599
type that I just showed you,
the combination of lotus leaves

00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:45.130
and acanthus leaves.
 

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:47.809
The Temple.
 

00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:51.117
The temple in this,
the temple here is the one that

00:59:51.117 --> 00:59:52.110
you see here.
 

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:53.130
It is a restored view.
 

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.159
It is from Ward-Perkins.
 

00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:58.190
It is a temple that was put up
by Caracalla.

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:01.360
It's the temple at the back
wall that we looked at in plan

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.139
just before.
 

01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:06.043
It was put up by Caracalla to
honor his parents as

01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:09.461
divi;
Septimius Severus and Julia

01:00:09.461 --> 01:00:10.059
Domna.
 

01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:12.179
It's interesting in a variety
of ways.

01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:15.940
It's interesting because it is
surrounded by an arcade;

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.409
columns supporting arcuations.
 

01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:22.112
We've seen an interest in this
sort of thing starting to come

01:00:22.112 --> 01:00:23.780
to the fore at this time.
 

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.010
We saw it in late domestic
architecture in Ostia.

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:29.905
Think of the House of Cupid and
Psyche, for example,

01:00:29.905 --> 01:00:31.018
of the early fourth century.
 

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:34.550
So placing these arcades on
columns, with Medusa heads in

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:37.262
between them,
is something that comes to the

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:38.650
fore at this time.
 

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.277
We see that the temple is
placed on a very,

01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:43.719
very tall podium,
nineteen feet tall.

01:00:43.719 --> 01:00:44.050
Why?
 

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:49.114
To raise it up over the walls,
so that you could see it from a

01:00:49.114 --> 01:00:50.110
distance.
 

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.773
It's like when they raised the
Capitolium in Ostia also up high

01:00:52.773 --> 01:00:55.050
so that it could compete with
the apartment houses;

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.018
the same general idea here.
 

01:00:57.018 --> 01:01:01.351
Local limestone for the walls,
imported marble for the

01:01:01.351 --> 01:01:02.170
columns.
 

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:09.010
The staircase is interesting.
 

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:10.960
It's a single staircase,
but you can see it is pyramidal

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.349
in shape.
 

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:13.773
I don't want to push the
Egyptian thing too far,

01:01:13.773 --> 01:01:16.764
but it's conceivable that it
might have been designed under

01:01:16.764 --> 01:01:17.949
Egyptian influence.
 

01:01:17.949 --> 01:01:22.000
And if you look at the column
bases,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.577
we know that they were depicted
with images of the battle

01:01:24.577 --> 01:01:28.842
between gods and giants,
a very important theme in Greek

01:01:28.842 --> 01:01:29.329
art.
 

01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:34.382
So we see once again what's so
interesting about some of these

01:01:34.382 --> 01:01:37.217
provincial cities;
this coming together of

01:01:37.217 --> 01:01:39.626
influences from all over the
world, from Greece,

01:01:39.626 --> 01:01:41.880
from Carthage,
from Egypt, and also of course

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.650
from Rome.
 

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:47.210
Here's a view of the arcades,
the Medusa's heads very deeply

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:51.197
carved, as you can see here;
characteristic also of the

01:01:51.197 --> 01:01:53.699
decorative work of the Severan
period.

01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:58.239
The plan, once again,
that shows us the basilica,

01:01:58.239 --> 01:02:00.483
central nave,
side aisles,

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:04.268
apses on either side,
looking very much like the

01:02:04.268 --> 01:02:06.460
Basilica Ulpia of Trajan in
Rome,

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.889
probably influenced by that.
 

01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:12.126
Look also, there's a wall
here--you can walk into the wall

01:02:12.126 --> 01:02:14.445
at several points--
and there are columns

01:02:14.445 --> 01:02:17.077
decorating that wall,
columns that just project into

01:02:17.077 --> 01:02:17.590
our space.
 

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:19.920
They have no structural purpose
whatsoever.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.659
The in-and-out undulation of
the wall,

01:02:22.659 --> 01:02:25.280
through the traditional
vocabulary of architecture,

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.996
another sign that we're moving
toward what I've called a

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:33.000
baroque phase in Roman
antiquity.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.588
This is an amazing view,
from the air,

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.949
of the remains of the forum and
also of the basilica.

01:02:36.949 --> 01:02:39.710
The basilica is better
preserved than the forum.

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.791
The basilica--and you can see
how beautifully this is sited,

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:43.889
right near the sea.
 

01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.679
Again, we're dealing with a
port here, a port city here.

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:47.809
You can see the apses.
 

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.730
You can see the preserved
columns.

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:53.090
You can see the wedge-shaped
section of shops here.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:58.244
And you can see again that the
basilica has many of its columns

01:02:58.244 --> 01:03:01.820
better preserved than those in
the forum.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.110
We see them here.
 

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.588
We can get a much better sense
of what the basilica looked like

01:03:06.588 --> 01:03:10.023
in antiquity;
in fact, this is much better

01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:14.010
preserved than the Basilica
Ulpia in Rome.

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.782
And we see the difference in
the materials:

01:03:15.782 --> 01:03:17.849
the pink granite from Egypt,
used here as well;

01:03:17.849 --> 01:03:20.068
the Corinthian,
in this case,

01:03:20.068 --> 01:03:24.429
Corinthian capitals rather than
the lotus leaf capitals;

01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:26.650
sandstone for the walls.
 

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:30.612
So this combination of local
stone and especially imported

01:03:30.612 --> 01:03:32.630
marbles for this structure.
 

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:37.000
Here's a restored view of the
interior, where we can see it

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.371
was two-storied originally,
just like the Basilica Ulpia in

01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:42.050
Rome.
 

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:44.338
Like the Basilica Ulpia in
Rome, a flat ceiling with a

01:03:44.338 --> 01:03:46.110
coffered ceiling,
as you can see above.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:50.360
And we can also see the niches
have coffering in them.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.559
Very interesting decoration.
 

01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:56.152
Use of columns on two tiers;
no structural purpose

01:03:56.152 --> 01:04:00.271
whatsoever, decorative only,
projecting into our space,

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:04.010
creating that in-and-out,
undulating movement.

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:06.016
And then a very unusual motif,
architectural motif,

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:06.659
in the center.
 

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:09.911
I show you here the south apse,
where we can see the pink

01:04:09.911 --> 01:04:13.541
granite, once again preserved;
Ionic capitals in this

01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:17.907
particular case for that niche;
and then these very heavily

01:04:17.907 --> 01:04:20.360
decorated pilasters,
on either side.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.530
And in the center of the niche,
these very tall columns--

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:27.351
this is very interesting
because it seems to have had no

01:04:27.351 --> 01:04:30.480
purpose whatsoever than just to
stand there and look good--

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.159
two colossal columns on tall
bases,

01:04:33.159 --> 01:04:37.217
with Corinthian capitals,
and then a lintel on top of

01:04:37.217 --> 01:04:39.413
those,
and then griffins,

01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:42.400
and then another lintel on the
top.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.480
What was the purpose of this?
 

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.550
Did it have some kind of
religious purpose?

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:47.710
Well this is a civic structure,
so unlikely.

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:50.563
It's just a decoration,
among other decorations,

01:04:50.563 --> 01:04:53.599
but using architectural
elements in toto.

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:55.920
The piers are very,
very interesting.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.306
They're eaten away,
dematerialized by their

01:04:58.306 --> 01:05:00.594
sculpture;
as you can see here,

01:05:00.594 --> 01:05:02.840
light and dark accentuated.
 

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.663
And if you look at the details
of them, you will see that one

01:05:06.663 --> 01:05:10.103
of them, or a couple of them,
have scenes of the Twelve

01:05:10.103 --> 01:05:11.570
Labors of Hercules.
 

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:16.010
Remember, this was a building
that was completed by Caracalla.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.255
Is it a stretch to say that
Caracalla might have wanted to

01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:22.329
have Herculean imagery here,
as he did in the Baths of

01:05:22.329 --> 01:05:24.905
Caracalla,
or the benefactor who helped

01:05:24.905 --> 01:05:28.309
build this might have had that
in mind as well,

01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:29.579
to make that connection?
 

01:05:29.579 --> 01:05:32.063
It might be far-fetched,
but certainly something worth

01:05:32.063 --> 01:05:32.860
thinking about.
 

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.059
And two more details of that
decoration here.

01:05:36.059 --> 01:05:39.704
I want to mention just in
passing the Arch of Septimius

01:05:39.704 --> 01:05:40.380
Severus.
 

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.923
It's more a work of sculpture
than it is of architecture,

01:05:42.923 --> 01:05:45.559
and it has a lot of figural
scenes that are interesting for

01:05:45.559 --> 01:05:46.559
their iconography.
 

01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:50.010
But I just want to make passing
reference to it,

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.402
because it is the one building
that I mentioned that we do

01:05:52.402 --> 01:05:56.452
believe was put up in 203,
and ready for Septimius' visit

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.679
to the city.
 

01:05:57.679 --> 01:06:03.244
It also is interesting because
it was made at the same time as

01:06:03.244 --> 01:06:06.931
the arch in Rome,
the Parthian Arch in Rome,

01:06:06.931 --> 01:06:10.862
203 A.D.,
and also celebrates Septimius

01:06:10.862 --> 01:06:15.090
Severus' victories over the
Parthians.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.914
That's exactly what it
celebrates, and those scenes are

01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:18.199
alluded to in the figural
sculpture.

01:06:18.199 --> 01:06:21.027
But it is very different from
the arch in Rome,

01:06:21.027 --> 01:06:23.239
because it is a
tetrapylon.

01:06:23.239 --> 01:06:25.222
I mentioned the
tetrapylon when we went

01:06:25.222 --> 01:06:27.663
over the paper topics;
the four-sided arch,

01:06:27.663 --> 01:06:32.159
the purpose of which is to span
two streets that cross at that--

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:34.050
that intersect at that
particular point,

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:40.050
so that traffic can go through
the arch, going both ways.

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.177
It's really quite ingenious,
and we see the

01:06:42.177 --> 01:06:45.371
tetrapylon does not take
off in Rome, but is very popular

01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:47.449
in the provinces,
and we see it here.

01:06:47.449 --> 01:06:50.320
We also see as we look at this
structure,

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.460
and it has been--by the way,
it had fallen down completely

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.501
but has been re-erected,
although the sculpture on it is

01:06:57.501 --> 01:06:59.545
casts,
and the original sculpture in

01:06:59.545 --> 01:07:00.119
the museum.
 

01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:03.621
But we do see here something
very interesting,

01:07:03.621 --> 01:07:08.369
and that is that they have used
the broken triangular pediment

01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:09.070
here.
 

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.146
You can see the way the
pediment is broken apart,

01:07:12.146 --> 01:07:15.670
and used only in part here,
which is something we do not

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:17.530
see in Roman arch design.
 

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.190
Here's a view of it from the
side,

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:22.507
where you can get a sense of
the drama of those broken

01:07:22.507 --> 01:07:25.452
triangular pediments,
as well as the way in which

01:07:25.452 --> 01:07:28.389
this structure was completely
covered with sculpture,

01:07:28.389 --> 01:07:31.538
and you can see some of that
sculpture also dematerializing

01:07:31.538 --> 01:07:34.585
the arch,
in a way very similar to the

01:07:34.585 --> 01:07:38.010
piers that we saw also in the
basilica.

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:41.972
And I just show you quickly two
details of the figural sculpture

01:07:41.972 --> 01:07:45.431
that we see there honoring
Septimius Severus and his two

01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:48.199
sons in a triumphal chariot,
at the top.

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:51.827
And then down here below,
Septimius shaking hands with

01:07:51.827 --> 01:07:54.635
his elder son,
Caracalla, as if giving him

01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:55.320
power.
 

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:59.581
Geta stands in the center;
Geta's still alive and not

01:07:59.581 --> 01:08:05.079
erased on this monument here,
and Geta's standing here.

01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:07.528
And then this wonderful image
of Julia Domna,

01:08:07.528 --> 01:08:10.144
with her fabulous wig,
standing next to them and

01:08:10.144 --> 01:08:10.980
looking on.
 

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.072
But look at this figure here.
 

01:08:13.072 --> 01:08:14.010
Who is this?
 

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.702
Hercules with his club,
standing right behind the

01:08:15.702 --> 01:08:16.550
shoulder of Caracalla.
 

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:20.840
So once again this very close
association between Caracalla

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.319
and his alter ego.
 

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:28.108
I want to end today with my
favorite building in Leptis

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:30.019
Magna --
in fact, one of my favorite

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:31.170
buildings from the entire
semester,

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:33.069
because it's so unique.
 

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:37.020
This is the so-called Hunting
Baths at Leptis Magna.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:42.720
They date to the late second to
early third century A.D.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.828
I show you an axonometric view
from Ward-Perkins.

01:08:45.828 --> 01:08:49.032
They're very well preserved,
and I'll show them to you in a

01:08:49.032 --> 01:08:49.529
moment.
 

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:52.182
This bath is interesting in all
kinds of ways,

01:08:52.182 --> 01:08:55.601
but it's interesting primarily
because it's a private bath,

01:08:55.601 --> 01:08:58.100
not a public bath;
we've looked at so many public

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:58.939
baths this semester.
 

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:00.699
What do I mean by a private
bath?

01:09:00.699 --> 01:09:02.069
Not one individual.
 

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:05.452
I suppose one could call
Hadrian's baths in his villa

01:09:05.452 --> 01:09:08.770
private, in that they were for
his private villa.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.729
But here a private bath within
a city,

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:14.329
a private bath,
not for a single individual but

01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:17.456
a group of individuals,
a guild of men,

01:09:17.456 --> 01:09:23.640
whose profession we believe it
was to collect animals,

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.920
wild animals,
in the wilds of Africa,

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.213
and send them to Italy;
that was their business,

01:09:31.213 --> 01:09:34.481
send them--to feed,
in a sense, the amphitheaters

01:09:34.481 --> 01:09:36.729
of Rome and the rest of Italy.
 

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:37.880
That was their job.
 

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.430
They probably made quite a
fortune doing that.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.623
And they got together and built
for themselves this wonderful

01:09:43.623 --> 01:09:45.283
bath,
which you're going to see right

01:09:45.283 --> 01:09:47.411
near the sea,
where they could kick back and

01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:49.250
relax and hang out with each
other.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:53.000
And what a place it was.
 

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.752
And what's interesting about it
is although we have seen that

01:09:56.752 --> 01:10:00.069
concrete was not used
extensively in Leptis Magna,

01:10:00.069 --> 01:10:02.496
it is used for this building,
and this building is much more

01:10:02.496 --> 01:10:04.921
innovative for that reason than
most of the other structures

01:10:04.921 --> 01:10:06.970
we've seen,
even those that honor Septimius

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.171
Severus,
like the arch,

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:10.270
like the forum,
and like the basilica.

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:11.908
What do I mean by innovative?
 

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:15.043
You can see the way in which
concrete has been used here,

01:10:15.043 --> 01:10:15.939
to its utmost.
 

01:10:15.939 --> 01:10:17.460
You enter into the structure.
 

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.600
The forecourt is an octagon,
the entrance vestibule is an

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.340
octagon.
 

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.127
From the entrance vestibule,
you go into the

01:10:24.127 --> 01:10:26.408
tepidarium,
which you can see has a

01:10:26.408 --> 01:10:28.823
segmented dome,
a kind of pumpkin dome,

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:31.569
influenced by those earlier
ones of Hadrian,

01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:33.390
into the caldarium over
here,

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:34.988
which is large and barrel
vaulted.

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.846
The frigidarium,
also barrel vaulted here,

01:10:37.846 --> 01:10:38.859
as you can see.
 

01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:43.274
But what makes these rooms
particularly exciting

01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:46.530
architecturally,
and different than anything

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:48.788
we've seen--
in fact, unique--is that not

01:10:48.788 --> 01:10:51.279
only can we see the shapes of
these vaults,

01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:54.340
these concrete vaults,
on the inside when we stand

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.408
here,
but also from the outside;

01:10:56.408 --> 01:11:01.000
the shapes are visible from the
outside as well.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.060
You can see from the outside
that this was a barrel vaulted

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.842
room;
you can see from the outside

01:11:04.842 --> 01:11:06.868
that this was a barrel vaulted
room;

01:11:06.868 --> 01:11:09.577
and you can see from the
outside that this one had a

01:11:09.577 --> 01:11:10.479
segmented dome.
 

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:13.840
We haven't seen that in other
architecture.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.060
Yes, you can get a little
glimmer of it;

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.542
when you look at the
frigidaria of the great

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.975
imperial baths in Rome,
you can get a sense of the

01:11:20.975 --> 01:11:23.109
groin vaults from the outside,
sort of.

01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:25.979
But not in the way that you can
here.

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:29.198
This is very revolutionary,
very different,

01:11:29.198 --> 01:11:32.800
and very special to this
particular building.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.556
And I'll show you two last
images where you can see that,

01:11:35.556 --> 01:11:36.738
also from the outside.
 

01:11:36.738 --> 01:11:39.604
This one in black and white,
and you can see the massing of

01:11:39.604 --> 01:11:42.132
these geometric forms,
from the outside,

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:46.090
which make very clear what lies
inside, very clear.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:48.630
Remember the Pantheon with its
surprise.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.659
You're standing outside;
it looks like a typical Greek

01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:52.189
temple.
 

01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:55.350
You walk inside,
wow, it's a Roman interior.

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:58.796
Here it's inside and outside
are brought together in a way

01:11:58.796 --> 01:12:00.609
that we haven't seen before.
 

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:03.220
When you stand at the outside
of this building and look at it,

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.010
you can tell what those shapes
are like on the inside,

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:07.979
in a way that we have not seen
before --

01:12:07.979 --> 01:12:11.010
a truly revolutionary building.
 

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:12.500
And I show you one last image.
 

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.170
It's faded, but it's the best
I've got,

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:20.010
and it's a really I think very
effective image,

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:22.618
in terms of showing you what
these baths looked like

01:12:22.618 --> 01:12:25.840
silhouetted against the sand and
the sea: the barrel vaults,

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.832
the segmented vaults,
all of those clearly revealed

01:12:28.832 --> 01:12:31.729
on the outside,
as they were on the inside.

01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:35.520
A very innovative structure,
put up not by the emperor,

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.876
not by the reigning emperor,
not by benefactors who wanted

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:41.810
to honor the emperor,
and not part of that great

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:44.733
Severan renovation,
but part of the individual

01:12:44.733 --> 01:12:47.988
hearts and minds of this
particular group of men.

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:52.345
And what can I say to end this
lecture, except for those men in

01:12:52.345 --> 01:12:55.154
the late second/early third
century A.D.,

01:12:55.154 --> 01:12:56.420
life was good.
 

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.859
Thank you all.

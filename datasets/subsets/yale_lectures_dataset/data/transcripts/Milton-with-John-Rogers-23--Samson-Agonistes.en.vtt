00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.970
Professor John Rogers:
We ended the last lecture,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.716
or actually I ended my last
lecture -- The last lecture was

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:13.332
Matt's -- I ended my last
lecture on Paradise Regained

00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:17.660
with the brief consideration
of the riddle of the sphinx.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.763
Satan was compared to the
sphinx who had thrown herself

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:26.550
off the "Ismenian steep" when
her riddle had been discovered.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.556
The Son of God,
you'll remember,

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:32.309
was implicitly compared to
Oedipus, who had figured out the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.127
riddle of his own identity by
means of his exchange with the

00:00:36.127 --> 00:00:39.816
sphinx.I think it can be
said that Samson Agonistes

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:43.828
is more explicitly concerned
with riddles and with riddling

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:47.000
even than Paradise Regained
was.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.977
One of the key moments --
although this isn't anything

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:53.516
that Milton does very much with
-- one of the key moments of the

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:57.056
story of Samson that we get from
the Book of Judges in the Bible

00:00:57.056 --> 00:01:00.483
involves Samson's posing of this
big riddle: the riddle of the

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.930
honey and the lion.
It's Samson,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.263
at least in the Judges version
of the story,

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:10.450
who can be seen as assuming the
role of the sphinx.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.806
He poses the riddles,
and it's really his duty

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:20.517
throughout his life to know when
it is you should reveal the

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:24.390
answer to the riddle,
to the secret.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.951
Samson Agonistes is,
I think, profoundly interested

00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.326
in this problem and is
continually asking the question:

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:34.825
how do you know when it's
time--how do you know when it's

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:39.346
time to reveal your secrets?
Or -- to use the language that

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:43.900
Milton uses in the seventh
sonnet, "How soon hath time?"

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.739
-- how do you know when it is
that you have ripened?

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:53.407
That's a riddle that it's the
job of Samson in Samson

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:57.819
Agonistes to figure out the
answer to.Now,

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.847
it's one of the ironies of
literary history that this poem,

00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:05.180
which is really all about
riddles and secrets,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.688
surely poses the biggest riddle
for the scholarly,

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:10.979
the academic,
study of Milton.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.740
It has proven nearly impossible
for scholars of Milton to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.432
determine when it was that
Samson Agonistes --

00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:22.729
to determine authoritatively
or definitively when it was that

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.914
this text was written.
In that respect,

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:31.051
it's utterly different from the
other works of Milton's that can

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.150
be dated much more
authoritatively.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.300
We do know this.
It first appears in 1671;

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.840
it's published alongside
Paradise Regained.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.528
So you have the title page
of that 1671 volume,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:47.289
"Paradise Regained, a
poem in four books,"

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.207
and then in a little typeface,
"To which is added Samson

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:54.666
Agonistes."
Actually the Hughes

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:58.265
edition reproduces for
you just this title page -- it's

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.650
on page 470.
But there's no hard evidence

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.704
for the date of the composition
of the poem, and there are

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.262
conflicting accounts,
as of course you can imagine,

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:08.104
of the date of
composition.So I want to

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.692
spend a little bit of time here,
and I'll just do this briefly,

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.456
thinking about the various
scholarly accounts of when it

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.810
was that Milton wrote Samson
Agonistes,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.337
 because all of these
theories, I think,

00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:24.470
concerning the placement of
Samson Agonistes in the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.767
Miltonic canon assume in one way
or another that this poem is

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:31.120
autobiographical -- that there's
some kind of intimate,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.410
autobiographical component to
this remarkable work.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.603
The assumption is that on some
level Samson Agonistes

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:44.949
almost necessitates a type
of biographical reading.

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:50.047
So first, and this is the most
popular theory of the dating of

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:53.389
the poem and it's the one I
happen to,

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.825
and that most people,
subscribe to -- it's the theory

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:00.789
that places Samson Agonistes
as Milton's last poem,

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:05.831
which means that this is a poem
that's written well after the

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.490
middle of the 1660s.
Milton seems to have started

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.336
writing Paradise Regained
around 1665,

00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:15.569
so it would have been after
that at some point,

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.686
well into the Stuart
restoration.This reading

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:22.581
really suggests, to the
extent that this is a thematic

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:25.729
reading of the poem,
that Samson is like

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.641
Milton, the great political hero
or the erstwhile great political

00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.985
hero.
Samson had almost led the

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:36.661
Hebrews to freedom by destroying
so many of the Philistines with

00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.867
his extraordinary,
divinely inspired violence,

00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:43.649
but the Hebrew leaders failed
to join Samson in this mission.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:48.183
They ruined their chance for
freedom from the Philistine

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:50.803
yoke.
In the 1650s and in the 1660s,

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:54.685
Milton was always continually
representing himself in just

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:58.314
this same light.
With the help of Milton's own

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:02.904
aggressively propagandistic
efforts, the English had begun

00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:07.251
to fulfill the promise of
something like a full-fledged

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.801
revolution,
but the weak-minded

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:13.120
parliamentary leaders had failed
to carry it out;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.303
and out of some sort of moral
weakness, the English people

00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:22.667
began to yearn again for
subjection to the Stuart

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:25.913
monarchy.
It's in response to the tone of

00:05:25.913 --> 00:05:30.108
political disappointment that we
can read in Samson Agonistes

00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:34.170
that scholars are led to
date this work as a late one,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.104
as a final poem -- the final
poem.Now,

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:41.398
the second theory of the date
of the composition of Samson

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:44.690
Agonistes places it in the
late 1640s,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.730
in the period somewhere between
1647 and 1653.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.260
This reading suggests that
Samson Agonistes

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.967
constitutes Milton's first
great response to the onset of

00:05:56.967 --> 00:06:00.093
his blindness.
By placing the poem in this

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.899
period -- and you can tell what
scholars are responding to in

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:07.524
the poem with this theory.
They're clearly trying to make

00:06:07.524 --> 00:06:10.319
some sense of the tremendous
amount of pathos,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.541
and you could actually say the
tremendous amount of self-pity,

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:21.019
that charges Milton's treatment
of Samson's blindness.Now,

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:26.464
the third theory of the poem's
composition places it even

00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:31.519
earlier in Milton's career
during the early 1640s.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:36.104
This is the period in which
Milton was writing the divorce

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.976
pamphlets.
In this account,

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:44.099
the center of the poem becomes
a reflection,

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:50.522
or some sort of representation,
of the betrayal Milton must

00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:55.180
have experienced himself when
his wife of six weeks,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.535
Mary Powell,
left him -- just abandoned him

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:03.509
it seemed.
She went home to her parents.

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.862
Now in the poem,
in Samson Agonistes,

00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:09.060
Dalila you'll remember --
she was a Philistine.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.122
She was a member of a political
tribe that had so oppressed the

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:16.792
Hebrews -- and Mary Powell's
family had all been royalist

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:22.892
during the English civil wars,
and so to some extent perhaps

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:27.699
Mary Powell herself was a
royalist.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.846
The leanings,
at least, of the Powell family,

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:34.565
it has been conjectured,
contributed significantly to

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:38.928
what turned out to be merely the
temporary erosion of Milton's

00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:42.812
first marriage.
According to this theory then,

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:47.496
the main thrust of Samson
Agonistes isn't exclusively

00:07:47.496 --> 00:07:52.339
political, but it's domestic --
or domestic and political.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:56.826
Milton uses a biblical story to
reinvent, and in some way to

00:07:56.826 --> 00:08:00.020
work through,
the private disaster that was

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.660
the early portion of his
marriage to Mary Powell.Now,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.655
I think the third theory is --
it has to be wrong,

00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:10.772
that Samson Agonistes
was written so early in

00:08:10.772 --> 00:08:15.115
Milton's career in the 1640s.
But I am personally much too

00:08:15.115 --> 00:08:20.098
invested in the notion that this
is the last poem to have its

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:24.500
status be relinquished as a
post-Restoration work.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.745
Nonetheless,
I want to think about that

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:32.528
third option that I've just
mentioned and to focus on the

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:36.628
nature of Milton's
representation of the relation

00:08:36.628 --> 00:08:39.960
of Samson to Dalila in this
poem,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.076
which is an undeniably powerful
aspect of this work.Let me

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:49.606
just digress here for a moment
and explain to you why I

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:53.799
pronounce her name "Dalila" and
not "Delilah".

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.112
When I use the word "Delilah"
in this lecture,

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:59.145
that will be referring to the
character in the Old Testament

00:08:59.145 --> 00:09:02.126
from the Book of Judges -- the
name with an h on the

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:03.692
end.
Milton doesn't have an h

00:09:03.692 --> 00:09:06.092
on the end.
He uses the Latin spellings

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:10.300
from the Latin Bible of all of
the characters in Samson

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.758
Agonistes.
So the father is Manoa

00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:18.046
rather than Manoah.
He makes up the name Harapha,

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:23.350
but it's along the same sort of
Latin lines of Dalila and Manoa.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.498
Who knows why Milton wants to
classicize these names rather

00:09:28.498 --> 00:09:33.379
than using the English
transliteration of the Hebrew!

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.509
It's been conjectured that it
just sounds prettier.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:40.604
You have a line like "the
sumptuous Dalila floating this

00:09:40.604 --> 00:09:44.774
way," those extraordinary
dactyls that seem incredibly so

00:09:44.774 --> 00:09:48.193
sensual and seductive.
You couldn't have that with

00:09:48.193 --> 00:09:51.049
Delilah, "the sumptuous Delilah
floating this way."

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:55.690
It just doesn't -- it's not as
sexy.Okay.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.100
That was just a pronunciation
digression.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.124
Now the evidence for the
scholars who date this poem as a

00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:10.237
really early one is usually
taken from a scene in Milton's

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:15.800
life that actually was narrated
for us by Milton's nephew,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.551
Edward Phillips.
So I'm going to ask you to turn

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:22.446
to Milton's nephew's,
Edward Phillips',

00:10:22.446 --> 00:10:27.092
biography of Milton at the end
of the Hughes edition --

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:30.139
this is page 1032 in the
Hughes.

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:34.117
This is Phillips' account
of how Milton and Mary Powell

00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:37.820
reunited, and it's an absolutely
adorable narrative.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.209
It involves an elaborate trick
staged by friends of both Milton

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.069
and of Powell.
So we learn here -- it's an

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:49.390
amazing little window onto what
the texture of this man's life

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.330
was like -- that Milton was
evidently in the habit,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.278
in the six weeks he lived alone
as the abandoned husband,

00:10:56.278 --> 00:11:00.048
of visiting a friend.
We don't know who this guy was,

00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:03.514
but according to Phillips --
this is the top of the

00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:07.603
right-hand column -- it was at
Blackborough's house that the

00:11:07.603 --> 00:11:12.100
scheme to reunite the couple,
to reunite them, was pulled off.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.113
I'm quoting here from Phillips: 
One time above the rest,

00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:19.978
he [John Milton]
making his usual visit,

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:22.769
the wife was ready in another
room,

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:25.722
and on a sudden he was
surprised to see one whom he

00:11:25.722 --> 00:11:30.387
thought to have never seen more,
making submission and begging

00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:36.178
pardon on her knees before him.
He might probably at first make

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:39.590
some show of aversion and
rejection;

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.577
but partly his own generous
nature [this is the loving

00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:48.059
Phillips who so admires the
uncle],

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:51.023
more inclinable to
reconciliation than to

00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:53.690
perseverance in anger and
revenge,

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.463
and partly the strong
intercession of friends on both

00:11:57.463 --> 00:12:01.454
sides, soon brought him to an
act of oblivion and a firm

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:04.429
league of peace for the
future.

00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:09.282
And Mary Powell and John Milton
get back together again,

00:12:09.282 --> 00:12:13.870
and they have a child -- they
have a few children.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.851
This scene bears an obvious
resemblance to the initial

00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:20.480
entrance of Dalila into the
poem,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.713
Samson Agonistes.Now
there's no proof,

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:29.564
of course, that Milton's
Samson is a reworking of

00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:34.767
this biographical event in the
stormy life that was Milton's

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:38.031
domestic -- the stormy career
[laughs]

00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:42.392
of Milton's domestic life.
There's no proof that this

00:12:42.392 --> 00:12:45.369
event ever happened at all.
My guess actually is that

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:48.691
Phillips, who's writing this
biographical narrative well

00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:51.590
after the publication of
Samson Agonistes,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.471
is actually staging his
account of this moment in

00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:59.652
Milton's life in some way as a
reworking of the analogous

00:12:59.652 --> 00:13:03.978
moment from Samson Agonistes.
I think he's giving us an

00:13:03.978 --> 00:13:06.860
imaginative engagement of
Samson Agonistes,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.509
 and it's probably
because he wants to stave off

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:14.613
what he knows will be the easy,
obvious biographical reading

00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:18.361
that we will bring to Milton's
poetic representation of a

00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:21.840
perfectly disastrous
marriage.So I don't actually

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.258
trust Phillips' biography here,
but I want to linger on this

00:13:26.258 --> 00:13:30.489
passage for just another moment
because I think it starts to

00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:34.434
illuminate one of the most
puzzling aspects of Samson

00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:37.232
Agonistes.
Look at Phillips' metaphor

00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:40.793
in the last sentence that I just
quoted: Milton's "own generous

00:13:40.793 --> 00:13:43.407
nature…
brought him to an act of

00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:47.500
oblivion and a firm league of
peace for the future…"

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.626
Phillips is alluding here to
actual political events,

00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:56.070
political events that took
place not in the 1640s -- when

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.070
we know this reunion occurred --
but after the Restoration.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.718
The Act of Oblivion and the
League of Peace are both actual

00:14:05.718 --> 00:14:10.448
political events that followed
the restoration of the Stuart

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:15.177
monarchy in 1660.So the
royalists in 1660 passed the Act

00:14:15.177 --> 00:14:18.317
of Oblivion,
and the Act of Oblivion

00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:22.229
prohibited any further
punishment of Puritans who were

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:26.509
seen to have behaved seditiously
during the revolution.

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:31.638
So in a gesture of magnanimity,
the royalists were agreeing to

00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:34.465
be oblivious.
They would forget -- they would

00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:37.039
forget the crimes of the Puritan
parliamentarians.

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:39.463
One of the most notable
beneficiaries,

00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:43.000
in fact, of this Act of
Oblivion was Milton himself,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.815
Milton whose life was,
I think, really mercifully

00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:51.132
spared after the Restoration.
He could easily have been

00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:55.431
prosecuted and executed for his
composition of the regicide

00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:59.434
treatises.I think it's
fascinating what Phillips is

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:02.729
doing here.
He situates the relation of

00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:06.869
husband and wife in the context
of a political accord,

00:15:06.869 --> 00:15:11.009
a political agreement between
two warring parties.

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:12.763
In doing so,
he's reproducing,

00:15:12.763 --> 00:15:16.150
I think, one of the strangest
aspects, and it is a really

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.238
strange aspect,
of this poem:

00:15:18.238 --> 00:15:21.055
that's the remarkable
conjunction of the

00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:25.245
representation of love and the
representation of war -- the

00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:29.650
militaristic nature of sexual
relations in Samson Agonistes

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.623
and also the disturbingly
sexual nature of political

00:15:33.623 --> 00:15:37.812
conflict as it's represented in
Samson Agonistes.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:41.785
We'll pursue that in a
moment.One of the curious

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:46.046
elements of Phillips' account of
Mary Powell's return is the

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:49.894
implicit reversal,
I think, of political

00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:52.868
identities here.
Milton becomes the royalist

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:56.909
passing the Act of Oblivion by
way of forgiving Mary Powell;

00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:59.849
so these domestic enemies,
Powell and Milton,

00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:03.591
have become -- it's as if
they've become mirror images of

00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:06.924
one another.
The moral alignment of their

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:11.129
identities suddenly becomes,
in this retelling of it,

00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:13.797
vague and indistinct.
In a lot of ways,

00:16:13.797 --> 00:16:16.193
they're kind of pictured like
Satan and the Son of God in

00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:19.161
Paradise Regained.
Satan in so many ways seems

00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:21.289
to be the Son of God's evil
twin.

00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:25.516
They're mirror images of one
another, but obviously they

00:16:25.516 --> 00:16:28.360
represent utterly different
things.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.942
The Son, you'll remember,
in Paradise Regained

00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:35.898
only discovers his
identity in that poem in

00:16:35.898 --> 00:16:39.727
opposition to Satan.
This is something that the late

00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.867
poems of Milton are continually
doing: they're exploring what we

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:47.810
can think of as the dialectical
nature of identification.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:54.251
Virtue cannot exist in a vacuum.
In fact, I think for Milton,

00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:59.460
the knowledge of oneself can't
come about in a vacuum.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.932
Any virtuous identity will
inevitably be the product of

00:17:04.932 --> 00:17:08.579
some kind of antithetical
process,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.019
of some sort of agonistic
encounter with one's

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:15.536
opposite.Now,
the antithetical construction

00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:19.970
of the hero's identity is really
central to this poem,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.622
Samson Agonistes,
and I think keeping this in

00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:27.489
mind will help us try to make
sense of some of its most

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:31.841
troubling components.
I think the components [laughs]

00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:36.883
of Samson Agonistes are
as troubling as anything you'll

00:17:36.883 --> 00:17:40.849
find anywhere in the reading for
this course.

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:45.245
For me what's most troubling is
this fact -- and this is an

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:49.868
undeniable, unquestionable fact:
Samson Agonistes gives

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:54.415
us the intensest expression of
misogyny that you will find in

00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:58.243
the Miltonic canon.
That's because this poem goes

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.109
further, I think,
than any of Milton's other

00:18:01.109 --> 00:18:04.976
poems in narrowing the problem
of identity -- and this is a

00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:08.910
problem that Milton has been
concerned with all along -- but

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.710
narrowing this larger problem of
identity to the much more

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.176
circumscribed and much more
focused problem of sexual

00:18:16.176 --> 00:18:19.710
identity.The masculine
hero's identity can only be

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.466
established by contraries,
by some sort of antithetical

00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:27.842
process.
Samson can only identify

00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:33.990
himself as a hero by rejecting,
by actively excluding,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.682
absolutely everything that's
not masculine,

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.309
rejecting everything that's not
heroic,

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:42.809
and rejecting everything that's
not Samson.

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:47.049
It becomes a kind of violent
process of rejection.

00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:50.847
The character,
Samson, is continually

00:18:50.847 --> 00:18:56.122
impelled, it seems,
by a powerful need to expel all

00:18:56.122 --> 00:19:02.663
forms of sensual pleasure -- the
types of pleasure that we know

00:19:02.663 --> 00:19:08.571
to be prized and sanctioned by
Milton -- that Milton will

00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:15.640
identify in Samson Agonistes
as types of femininity,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.788
and all of this has to be
expelled by Samson from

00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:21.150
Samson.As you reread the
poem,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.933
I think you'll be shocked -- if
you haven't been shocked already

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:30.792
-- by the violence of the really
weirdly sexualized rhetoric that

00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:34.664
makes up so much of the
metaphorical texture of this

00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:37.687
poem.
I'll give you just one example

00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:40.240
-- there are innumerable
examples.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.883
You may have noticed how this
poem refers routinely to the

00:19:45.883 --> 00:19:50.240
Philistine enemies as "the
uncircumcised."

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.940
On some level this is to be
expected.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.270
The Bible refers to heathens as
the uncircumcised,

00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.069
and so this is conventional we
could say;

00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:04.166
but Milton, of course,
needlessly goes further than

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:07.246
that.
He actually refers to the

00:20:07.246 --> 00:20:12.859
enemies of the Hebrews as
"foreskins": "With his sword of

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:17.069
bone Samson slew a thousand
foreskins."

00:20:17.069 --> 00:20:21.421
This is an unbelievable
synecdoche, synecdoche being the

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:25.140
rhetorical trope of using a part
for a whole,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.431
and Milton, as far as I can
tell, had absolutely no

00:20:28.431 --> 00:20:32.644
precedent whatsoever for the use
of this particular synecdoche to

00:20:32.644 --> 00:20:37.126
refer to an entire people,
the uncircumcised enemies of

00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:42.496
the Hebrews.There's a kind
of sexual violence continually

00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:45.987
[laughs]
welling up in the rhetoric used

00:20:45.987 --> 00:20:51.140
to describe political violence.
Think about what that [laughs]

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.361
implies.
To slay a thousand foreskins is

00:20:54.361 --> 00:20:58.878
in some way to imagine a
military victory as something

00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:02.693
like a mass circumcision or,
symbolically,

00:21:02.693 --> 00:21:07.295
some type of mass castration.
This is just one of many

00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:12.033
examples of a related kind of
figurative pattern in Samson

00:21:12.033 --> 00:21:15.195
Agonistes.
Political violence seems so

00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:19.467
continually to be figured in the
literary rhetoric of this poem

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:23.595
as a sexual cleansing,
as a kind of purging -- the

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:28.763
painful excision of something
unclean, something presumably

00:21:28.763 --> 00:21:32.583
unnecessary,
and something excessively

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.463
sensual.Look,
for example,

00:21:35.463 --> 00:21:42.019
at the way this text sexualizes
the key event in Samson's life,

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:45.829
which is of course,
the loss of his hair.

00:21:45.829 --> 00:21:49.646
Look at Samson's account of the
moment at which he lost his

00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:53.181
strength.
This is page 564 in the

00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:58.069
Hughes, lines 529 and
following.

00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:01.796
Now in the Book of Judges,
Samson tells Delilah that the

00:22:01.796 --> 00:22:05.387
secret of his strength lies in
his hair only after her

00:22:05.387 --> 00:22:08.797
continued verbal assaults.
She pleads with him,

00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:12.928
she nags him -- she pleads with
him unremittingly to tell her

00:22:12.928 --> 00:22:15.890
his secret, and finally he just
relents.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:20.576
That's the scriptural story;
but in Samson's account in

00:22:20.576 --> 00:22:24.534
Milton's story,
Dalila doesn't harass Samson in

00:22:24.534 --> 00:22:28.320
to telling the secret -- she
seduces him.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.561
Look at line 529.
This is Samson talking,

00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:38.160
and here he describes himself
as the cock of the walk here:

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.470
Fearless of danger,
like a petty God

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.099
I walk'd about admir'd of all
and dreaded

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:47.759
On hostile ground,
none daring my affront.

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:51.690
Then swoll'n with pride into
the snare I fell

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.779
Of fair fallacious looks,
venereal trains,

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:59.759
Softn'd with pleasure and
voluptuous life…

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:04.506
Now, the voluptuous life that
he's describing here in line 534

00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:08.953
is -- what is this?
I think this is what we would

00:23:08.953 --> 00:23:12.349
have to name the life of
marriage.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:15.986
The woman he's calling a
deceitful concubine is actually,

00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:18.259
in Milton's telling of the
story,

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:20.623
Samson's wife,
and there's a profound

00:23:20.623 --> 00:23:23.839
confusion about the cause of his
weakness here.

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:29.880
Was it the actual act of his
head being shaved or simply the

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.999
condition of marriage
itself?Listen to Milton's

00:23:34.999 --> 00:23:40.630
figuration of the event of the
cutting of his hair,

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.245
and you tell me if this isn't
unusually charged,

00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:47.861
even for Milton,
with a pretty intense degree of

00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:51.715
sexual anxiety:
At length to lay my head

00:23:51.715 --> 00:23:55.897
and hallow'd pledge
Of all my strength in the

00:23:55.897 --> 00:23:59.591
lascivious lap
Of a deceitful Concubine who

00:23:59.591 --> 00:24:02.231
shore me
Like a tame Wether,

00:24:02.231 --> 00:24:06.049
all my precious
fleece…

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:10.855
You have an image here of
sexual intercourse -- this has

00:24:10.855 --> 00:24:15.835
been suggested in a brilliant
reading of this poem by John

00:24:15.835 --> 00:24:20.378
Guillory -- embedded in the
image of Samson's head in

00:24:20.378 --> 00:24:24.990
Dalila's lascivious lap.
Her violation of Samson,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.470
her cutting of his hair,
seems almost inextricable here

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.524
from a perfectly simple,
seemingly -- it's never simple

00:24:33.524 --> 00:24:37.031
of course -- but an act of
conjugal intercourse.But the

00:24:37.031 --> 00:24:39.329
figurative chain doesn't end
there.

00:24:39.329 --> 00:24:41.625
It gets better or worse
[laughs]

00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:45.920
depending on your perspective,
because in this play marital

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.477
intercourse is equated,
at least figuratively,

00:24:49.477 --> 00:24:53.653
with castration -- the cutting
off of the hallowed pledge of

00:24:53.653 --> 00:24:57.456
Samson's strength.
Samson makes this explicit when

00:24:57.456 --> 00:25:00.520
he describes himself as "a tame
Wether."

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.360
"Well, what is a wether?"
you ask.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.469
A wether is a castrated ram.
The slayer of a thousand

00:25:07.469 --> 00:25:11.412
foreskins is himself slain,
and part of the intensely

00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:15.809
violent figurative world of
Samson Agonistes -- this

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:20.207
is a world that continually
identifies Dalila's betrayal as

00:25:20.207 --> 00:25:24.185
a kind of castration,
and castration itself is

00:25:24.185 --> 00:25:28.130
nothing more than the male
experience in marriage.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:34.573
A darker or more anxious
reading of the relation between

00:25:34.573 --> 00:25:41.017
the sexes you'll have a
difficult time finding.Let's

00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:45.470
look now at Dalila's own
language.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:56.650
Turn to page 570 in the
Hughes, around line 803.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.600
I think Dalila's language is in
a lot of ways just as powerful,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.789
though it's configured a little
differently.

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:05.028
Much more than Samson,
Dalila contradicts herself

00:26:05.028 --> 00:26:08.266
throughout this poem,
and the contradictions have

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:11.099
proven baffling to the poem's
critics.

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:14.341
One way of reading the
character, Dalila,

00:26:14.341 --> 00:26:18.069
is to insist that her
contradictions point out,

00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:22.191
emphasize, her mendacity.
These are just simply lies that

00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:24.191
she's telling,
and in a lot of ways,

00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:27.619
Milton does seem to be setting
her up as a type of Satan,

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:31.242
Satan who on Mount Niphates at
the beginning of Book Four of

00:26:31.242 --> 00:26:34.250
Paradise Lost was
continually contradicting

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.443
himself.Critics have
typically dismissed Dalila's

00:26:37.443 --> 00:26:40.379
explanations,
her justifications of her

00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:44.626
behavior, with the assumption
that Milton is simply trying to

00:26:44.626 --> 00:26:47.926
discredit her.
It's not an unjustifiable

00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:52.034
assumption, and I think that's
because the central

00:26:52.034 --> 00:26:57.232
contradiction of her discourse
involves her use of two types of

00:26:57.232 --> 00:27:00.081
arguments.
The first is an erotic,

00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:04.233
a romantic, argument and the
second argument she deploys is a

00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:06.857
political one.
Once again, it's this

00:27:06.857 --> 00:27:10.992
conjunction, the conjunction of
the sexual and the political,

00:27:10.992 --> 00:27:14.990
that in this poem proves so
unsettling and so puzzling.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.048
So let's look at Dalila's
reasons for betraying her

00:27:18.048 --> 00:27:20.754
husband.
This is her first argument,

00:27:20.754 --> 00:27:22.670
line 803.
She's essentially saying,

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.860
"I wanted you at home.
You were always going out.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.359
You were working all the time": 
I knew that liberty

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:31.359
Would draw thee forth to
perilous enterprises,

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:35.559
While I at home sate full of
cares and fears

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:39.279
Wailing thy absence in my
widow'd bed;

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:45.660
Here I should still enjoy thee
day and night [here at home]

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.720
Mine and Loves
prisoner…

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.740
"I unmanned you," she's saying,
"because I loved you so much."

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.872
That's the gist of the
argument.Dalila's second

00:27:56.872 --> 00:28:01.598
argument is entirely different,
and it's distinct from the

00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:05.519
complaint of the housewife that
we just looked at.

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:12.422
Look at the very bottom of page
571 -- this is line 857 and

00:28:12.422 --> 00:28:15.589
following.
Here Dalila tells us that she

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:18.230
had to betray Samson for
political reasons;

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:23.120
she had to do it to liberate
her people, the Philistines:

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.354
[T]he Priest
Was not behind [Dalila says]

00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:29.788
but ever at my ear,
Preaching how meritorious with

00:28:29.788 --> 00:28:32.067
the gods
It would be to ensnare an

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:36.480
irreligious
Dishonorer of Dagon: what had I

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.309
To oppose against such powerful
arguments?

00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:43.789
Only my love of thee held long
debate,

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.369
And combated in silence all
these reasons

00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:50.759
With hard contest:
at length that grounded maxim

00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:52.600
So rife and celebrated in the
mouths

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.779
Of wisest men;
that to the public good

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:59.839
Private respects must yield,
with grave authority

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:03.220
Took full possession of me and
prevail'd;

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.650
Vertue, as I thought,
truth, duty so enjoyning.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:13.295
And Dalila here gives us an
extraordinary revelation:

00:29:13.295 --> 00:29:17.225
on some level,
she turns out to be the mirror

00:29:17.225 --> 00:29:20.619
image of the great,
heroic Samson.

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:24.895
She plays the same role as the
deliverer of her people -- she's

00:29:24.895 --> 00:29:29.032
the deliverer of the Philistines
-- that Samson plays for the

00:29:29.032 --> 00:29:32.828
Hebrews.
She defends the gentile god,

00:29:32.828 --> 00:29:36.009
Dagon, and Samson,
her husband,

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:40.779
defends the Hebrew god,
Yahweh or Jehovah.

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.470
They're in direct competition
here.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.945
They're political opposites,
and Milton is playing with

00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:50.935
something approaching a sort of
cultural relativism by means of

00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:54.539
his representation of this
competition.There is,

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:57.775
however, a difference between
them, and it's a difference we

00:29:57.775 --> 00:30:02.032
have no choice but to deal with.
The difference between them is

00:30:02.032 --> 00:30:06.259
that Dalila, the wife,
sacrifices private concerns for

00:30:06.259 --> 00:30:09.210
a public commitment to her
people.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.169
In her words,
she yields "private respects"

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:16.230
to "the public good."
This is precisely what Samson

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.007
was supposed to do,
but of course,

00:30:19.007 --> 00:30:22.710
this is exactly what Samson
failed to do.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.158
So in a lot of ways,
these two explanations,

00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:27.776
these two arguments of
Dalila's, contradict one

00:30:27.776 --> 00:30:30.519
another.
On the literal level of the

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:34.332
plot the first motive,
the motive appropriate for a

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:38.846
wife, is revealed as a lie;
but the presence of these two

00:30:38.846 --> 00:30:42.071
conflicting motives bespeaks
more, I think,

00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:46.601
than the mere fact that Dalila
is a liar or that in some way

00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:51.900
Dalila is a satanic figure who's
just a very embodiment of evil.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.674
These two conflicting arguments
really speak to Samson's deepest

00:30:55.674 --> 00:30:59.210
anxieties and perhaps the
deepest anxieties of this poem,

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:04.078
Samson Agonistes.The
prospect of domestic pleasure is

00:31:04.078 --> 00:31:07.170
invariably a dangerous one for
Samson,

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.344
and that's because domestic
success, success at home,

00:31:11.344 --> 00:31:15.839
for Samson is indistinguishable
from political defeat.

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:20.433
Dalila's two arguments are
utterly -- it's as if inside of

00:31:20.433 --> 00:31:25.430
Samson's head they're utterly
intermingled with one another,

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:30.375
inextricable in Samson's psyche.
In the severely restricted,

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:34.440
circumscribed world of this
hero's consciousness,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.867
domestic comfort and political
failure turn out to be something

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:43.519
like one and the same thing.
In both instances the hero is

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:47.240
seen to have relinquished his
masculinity.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.531
He has undergone a humiliating
defeat, and with this dual

00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:55.900
identification of Dalila as wife
and as fierce warrior,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:01.222
you have a powerful sense of
the fragility of masculine

00:32:01.222 --> 00:32:05.855
heroic consciousness as it's
represented in this

00:32:05.855 --> 00:32:10.429
text.Okay.
Turn now to Dalila's final

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:14.688
offer to Samson.
This is at line 920,

00:32:14.688 --> 00:32:19.059
the middle of the Hughes' page
573.

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:24.779
The most tempting and the most
terrifying offer of Dalila's is

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:28.529
her offer to nurse Samson --
he's old,

00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:34.070
he's blind -- to nurse him
after his release from the

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.880
prison.
So Dalila tells Samson: 

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.329
I to the Lords will
intercede, not doubting

00:32:41.329 --> 00:32:44.079
Thir favourable ear,
that I may fetch thee

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:47.400
From forth this loathsom
prison-house to abide

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.440
With me, where my redoubl'd
love and care

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:55.490
With nursing diligence,
to me glad office,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.740
May ever tend about thee to old
age…

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:07.109
With her "nursing diligence,"
Dalila can be Samson's nurse.

00:33:07.109 --> 00:33:10.738
Better yet, she can function as
Samson's mother -- I think

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:14.366
that's essentially the gist of
her argument -- since it is

00:33:14.366 --> 00:33:18.312
already claimed we know -- this
was at line 633 -- he's claimed

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:23.205
that he is a nursling of God.
He's been struggling throughout

00:33:23.205 --> 00:33:28.710
this text to establish himself
as a child not of human parents,

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.242
certainly not of the perfectly
sweet nature but the kind of

00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:36.206
addled dad of his,
Manoa, but he's a child solely,

00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:40.548
exclusively of God
himself.It's Dalila's offer

00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:44.890
to nurse Samson that elicits his
most violent,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:49.150
most powerful, fit of rage.
It's horrible.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:54.228
Look at line 952.
Dalila says:

00:33:54.228 --> 00:34:00.940
"Let me approach at least,
and touch thy hand."

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:06.928
And Samson's response?
Shocking: "Not for thy life,

00:34:06.928 --> 00:34:14.722
lest fierce remembrance wake /
my sudden rage to tear thee

00:34:14.722 --> 00:34:20.421
joint by joint."
Dalila's simple offer to touch

00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:23.937
Samson's hand has received
[laughs]

00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:27.969
an extraordinarily extreme
reaction.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.909
It's usually thought -- this is
typically how we read this,

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.576
I think -- that the fierce
remembrance that will awaken

00:34:35.576 --> 00:34:39.380
Samson is his memory of his
powerful desire for her,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.305
a memory that he has to
forestall with this violent

00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:48.094
rejection.But I think the
violence of this reaction surely

00:34:48.094 --> 00:34:53.039
exceeds the violence merely of a
remembered sexual passion.

00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:57.975
This is too intense even for
that, and I think it's possible

00:34:57.975 --> 00:35:02.659
to see in this reaction to
Dalila's offer to nurse Samson

00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:06.340
another memory that has been
suppressed.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.639
It's not just the remembrance
of sexual love.

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:15.550
Our best clue to this
suppressed memory might come

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.499
from that aspect of the story of
Samson from the Book of Judges

00:35:20.499 --> 00:35:25.288
that has been most noticeably
suppressed -- perhaps it's been

00:35:25.288 --> 00:35:28.800
circumcised -- from Milton's own
poem.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.722
You'll remember from your
reading of the poem that Milton

00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:37.135
is continually referring to the
heavenly messenger who descended

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.777
to prophecy Samson's
greatness.This was happening

00:35:40.777 --> 00:35:44.840
well before Samson was actually
born -- but to whom?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.130
To whom did this heavenly
messenger speak?

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.305
According to the Judges story,
the angel spoke to Samson's

00:35:52.305 --> 00:35:56.700
mother, a character who figures
prominently in the scriptural

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.389
original of the story but who is
very carefully excluded from the

00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:06.176
text of Samson Agonistes.
I'm indebted for this point

00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:10.770
to a wonderful reading of this
poem by -- I think she's a great

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.030
Milton critic,
her name is Stevie Davies.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:19.447
In Samson's violent rejection
of Dalila, in his rejection of

00:36:19.447 --> 00:36:23.119
her offer to nurse him in his
old age,

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:28.703
Samson is rejecting on some
level the very existence of his

00:36:28.703 --> 00:36:31.232
mother.
He's denying the obvious fact

00:36:31.232 --> 00:36:34.730
that he had ever been mothered
at all, which is another way,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.534
of course, of denying his
humanity, of denying his status

00:36:39.534 --> 00:36:43.309
as a creature and his
createdness.Now,

00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:48.472
it has been years now -- Milton
has for years addressed himself

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:53.218
to the attraction and also to
the danger of the fantasy of

00:36:53.218 --> 00:36:57.447
heroic self-sufficiency.
I'll just remind you of Book

00:36:57.447 --> 00:37:01.242
Five of Paradise Lost in
which Milton explored the

00:37:01.242 --> 00:37:05.673
fantasy of self-creation,
Satan's remarkable and of

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:10.639
course implausible claim that he
was self-begot.

00:37:10.639 --> 00:37:14.200
Satan needed to deny,
he wanted to deny,

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.186
God's agency in his creation.
Now Samson's case is related

00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:19.880
but, of course,
it's a little different.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.006
Samson wants more than anything
to be a nursling of God,

00:37:24.006 --> 00:37:28.657
and it's as if he needs to deny
that he had ever had any tie to

00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:33.159
the womb or to the breast of an
earthly mother if he is to be

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:38.031
the nursling exclusively of God.
Of course, it's the fact,

00:37:38.031 --> 00:37:42.075
the existence of the mother,
that is the thing that

00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:46.280
guarantees the truth,
which is that he is inescapably

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.337
human;
but like us,

00:37:48.337 --> 00:37:53.106
Samson obviously owes a
fundamental physical debt,

00:37:53.106 --> 00:37:58.070
a fundamental physiological
debt and obligation,

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.132
to a mother.There's a sense
in this poem that the very

00:38:01.132 --> 00:38:03.453
existence of the mother,
of any mother,

00:38:03.453 --> 00:38:07.013
seems to doom all of our
attempts to think of ourselves

00:38:07.013 --> 00:38:09.166
as independent,
as autonomous,

00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:13.443
and in any way self-sufficient
beings, or to think of ourselves

00:38:13.443 --> 00:38:17.722
as beings whose primary debt can
be exclusively to the heavenly

00:38:17.722 --> 00:38:21.270
father.
Milton had been so bold in

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:26.920
Paradise Regained to
emphasize the thoroughgoing

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.081
humanity of the Son of God.
The Son of God in Paradise

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:36.333
Regained had no more divine
knowledge about his situation,

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:39.539
it seemed, than we could
possibly have had.

00:38:39.539 --> 00:38:43.362
It's in that [laughs]
poem where Milton should have

00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:46.880
been anxious about the humanity
of the hero,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.306
but all of that theological
anxiety that should have existed

00:38:51.306 --> 00:38:55.432
in Paradise Regained
seems to have been displaced

00:38:55.432 --> 00:38:58.658
onto Samson
Agonistes.Turn to the

00:38:58.658 --> 00:39:01.809
very opening of Samson
Agonistes,

00:39:01.809 --> 00:39:07.177
the exquisitely beautiful
lines with which Milton begins

00:39:07.177 --> 00:39:13.000
this poem: "A little onward lend
thy guiding hand / to these dark

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:22.679
steps,
a little further on…"

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:28.747
Milton's poem opens with these
beautiful lines addressed by

00:39:28.747 --> 00:39:33.464
Samson to someone,
presumably, who's holding his

00:39:33.464 --> 00:39:38.893
hand, who is touching his hand
and assisting his movements in

00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:43.780
his blindness -- Samson's
wandering steps and slow.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.712
This sense of absolute
dependence with which we begin

00:39:47.712 --> 00:39:51.367
this poem is overwhelming.
It's often argued that Milton

00:39:51.367 --> 00:39:54.016
is suggesting here something
like Samson's complete

00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:56.766
dependence on God.
This is the nursling of God,

00:39:56.766 --> 00:39:59.187
after all.
Samson's ultimate victory comes

00:39:59.187 --> 00:40:02.800
from his absolute submission to
the will of God.This much we

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.241
will learn at the end of the
poem but the character -- it's a

00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:09.601
character in fact,
it's not the Divinity -- the

00:40:09.601 --> 00:40:13.976
character leading Samson around
at the opening of the play is

00:40:13.976 --> 00:40:17.506
never named.
This character is never

00:40:17.506 --> 00:40:23.756
identified, and this mysterious
omission certainly has to be

00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:27.315
purposeful;
this is another clever argument

00:40:27.315 --> 00:40:31.300
forwarded by Stevie Davies.
The unnamed character holding

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.959
Samson's hand reminds us here of
another unnamed character in the

00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:39.016
Samson story,
and that's of course Samson's

00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:42.089
mother.
Samson as the champion of the

00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:46.791
Hebrews is supposed to be able
to submit himself utterly to the

00:40:46.791 --> 00:40:49.904
will of the Father,
not Manoa but the heavenly

00:40:49.904 --> 00:40:53.292
Father, but the play reminds us
overwhelmingly and continually

00:40:53.292 --> 00:40:56.625
that even the greatest heroes
are subject -- and you can tell

00:40:56.625 --> 00:41:00.070
that Milton was an enormous fan
of Shakespeare's tragedy,

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.381
Coriolanus,
which explores a lot of the

00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:07.723
same problems -- but even the
greatest heroes are subject to

00:41:07.723 --> 00:41:11.329
other far less dignified forms
of submission.

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:16.455
That human figure most likely
to lend a hand to unsteady steps

00:41:16.455 --> 00:41:21.320
is obviously the mother,
the person in the child's life

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.679
who touches the child's hand and
serves as his first guide,

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:28.524
first teacher.In
Paradise Regained,

00:41:28.524 --> 00:41:30.860
after all that we went through
in Paradise Regained,

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:37.737
Milton was able to allow
the Son to return home to his

00:41:37.737 --> 00:41:43.045
mother's house:
"hee unobserv'd / Home to his

00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:47.510
Mother's house private
return'd."

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.562
The Son of God had successfully
proven his son-ship to the

00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:54.833
heavenly Father,
and he could thereby afford to

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:59.186
return to the domestic space.
Of course, it's a domestic

00:41:59.186 --> 00:42:02.889
space that had been utterly
purged of any type of

00:42:02.889 --> 00:42:05.911
sensuality,
but in Samson Agonistes

00:42:05.911 --> 00:42:09.270
the space,
the place of maternal affection

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.825
and domestic peace -- of just
happiness in one's domestic life

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:18.230
-- is continually threatening to
contaminate the hero,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:23.240
and obviously this is a hero
who's a lot less well adjusted,

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.723
we could say,
than the Son of God.That

00:42:26.723 --> 00:42:30.460
didn't make any sense but on
some level,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:35.042
at least to me, it does.
Heroism in this poem depends on

00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:41.269
the hero's ability to exclude,
to expunge from his system,

00:42:41.269 --> 00:42:44.817
any attachment to the home,
any dependency on an origin

00:42:44.817 --> 00:42:47.840
that could compete with the
ultimate origin,

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.190
which is of course that of the
Heavenly Father.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:55.000
That's why this poem is
continually voicing its terrible

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.373
conviction in the necessary
exclusion of all things

00:42:59.373 --> 00:43:01.659
feminine.
It's in respect,

00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:05.752
I think, to this exclusion that
we can best understand the

00:43:05.752 --> 00:43:09.702
horrible violence and the
terrible misogyny charging the

00:43:09.702 --> 00:43:13.738
language of Samson Agonistes.
This poem,

00:43:13.738 --> 00:43:19.448
this play that's not really a
play, seems to be arguing for

00:43:19.448 --> 00:43:25.750
the necessary exclusion of the
feminine from the hero's life.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.437
If that's true,
if that is one of the ultimate

00:43:28.437 --> 00:43:31.363
arguments that Samson
Agonistes is actually

00:43:31.363 --> 00:43:34.855
making,
then I think we also have in

00:43:34.855 --> 00:43:40.929
this poem the pained and also
the painful rhetoric -- we have

00:43:40.929 --> 00:43:46.701
the painful sense that Milton
gives us of the cost of that

00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:51.039
exclusion.
Here in Milton's final poem,

00:43:51.039 --> 00:43:57.183
we have an acknowledgment that
the process whereby one becomes

00:43:57.183 --> 00:44:02.320
a Miltonic hero is potentially
ruinous.Okay.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.720
That's it for today.

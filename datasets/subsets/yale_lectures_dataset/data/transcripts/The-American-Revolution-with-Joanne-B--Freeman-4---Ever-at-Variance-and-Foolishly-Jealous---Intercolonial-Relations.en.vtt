00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.120
Prof: So let's actually
begin today's lecture,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.610
which is titled "Ever At
Variance and Foolishly Jealous--

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.340
Intercolonial Relations."
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.915
And the quote part of that
title, "Ever At Variance

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:21.685
and Foolishly Jealous,"
actually comes from a colonist

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.130
named Joseph Warren who was
writing to a friend,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.650
probably 1766,
I think--it doesn't matter;

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.550
it's--actually the quote's not
highly significant for you--

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.540
but the point of it is,
he was writing to a friend and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.925
what he says to his friend is:
until the passage of the Stamp

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:40.070
Act the colonies had always
been,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.398
quote, "ever at variance
and foolishly jealous,"

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:44.850
which is kind of going to be
the point of today's lecture.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.776
"Ever at variance and
foolishly jealous"--but now

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.047
with the Stamp Act,
boy, people seemed to be a

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:51.410
little bit more united.
 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.534
So today's lecture is the
foolishly jealous part and on

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.590
Tuesday we plunge into the Stamp
Act,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.098
which moves us to the more
united part and actually begins

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:05.853
a sort of series of events that
are actually going to build up

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:07.640
to a logic of resistance.
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.144
So I'm going to be talking
today about basically

00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:14.328
intercolonial relations,
about how people in the

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.310
different colonies viewed each
other,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.441
about how the colonies as
entities interacted with each

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.253
other,
and towards the end of the

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:28.072
lecture I'm going to talk about
colonial attempts before the

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:31.885
1760s for them to unite--
colonial attempts to unite and

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:33.830
act together--
and, as we're going to see

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.099
today, they weren't really
amazingly successful,

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.209
those attempts,
so--and there were only three

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.129
of them that I'm going to talk
about--

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.500
but unity is not taken for
granted.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.650
That, I suppose,
will be one message of today's

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.708
lecture: Don't take
unity--colonial unity for

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:47.269
granted.
 

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:50.188
And that's going to lead us up
perfectly to the next lecture on

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:53.045
the Stamp Act crisis,
which is then going to have

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:57.069
people shifting a point of view
because of the crisis at hand.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.364
Okay.
 

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.785
So basically,
in a way, today's lecture is

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.325
the third and last in a series
of lectures that's really been

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.394
laying the groundwork for our
immersion into colonial

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:07.340
conflict.
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.229
So we've looked at the links
between colonists and the mother

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.919
country,
we've looked at aspects of

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.418
colonial life and settlement
that were kind of distinctly

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:17.091
colonial American,
and now we're sort of laying

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.759
the last plank in,
of the British-American mindset

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.085
at the time,
and that's: how the colonies

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.930
were relating with each other.
 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.244
Okay.
 

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.762
And I--again I sort of--in
Freeman's Top Five Tips that I

00:02:27.762 --> 00:02:31.030
offered in the introductory
lecture that I gave,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.470
the Top Five Tips Towards
Understanding the Revolution--

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.150
and I said, "remember
contingency"--

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.378
and I suppose that's a sort of
subtheme of today's lecture,

00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:41.752
because we so assume the logic
and inevitability of a unified

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.449
nation at some point down the
pike.

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.735
I think it's really easy for us
to forget some of the things

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:48.440
that I'm going to be talking
about today,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.955
which all add up to:
unity did not make sense a lot

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:52.940
of the time.
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.450
Now I think to really
appreciate ultimately how

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.878
significant the first little
glimmerings at union were,

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:04.468
we first have to understand the
vast differences between the

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:07.389
different colonies and the
different regions,

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.960
because people at the time
definitely did.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.990
They were always complaining
and remarking on people from

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.799
other regions,
about how weird they were,

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.473
about their bizarre manners,
about the weird way they

00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:22.710
dressed, about their strange
attitude: constantly,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.086
people from all regions,
all colonies sort of remarking

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:29.651
in a not necessarily favorable
way about people from other

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.340
places.
 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.449
And I want to start--I want to
offer you a couple of examples,

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.490
and I want to start with Thomas
Jefferson,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.553
who in the 1780s devoted some
of his energies to explaining

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.258
America to a French audience.
 

00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:45.651
And as you'll hear in some of
these quotes,

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:48.840
he's going to definitely be
sounding like a Virginian.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.584
And of course what's
interesting to note about

00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:53.847
Jefferson is--
I'll quote him another time in

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:56.384
today's lecture--
Jefferson's strongest remarks

00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:59.732
about America or American
character are always made to a

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:00.949
foreign audience.
 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:01.324
Right?
 

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.508
He doesn't make them to
Americans.

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:05.000
So like, Notes on the State
of Virginia,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.150
which has some remarkable
passages in it--

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.210
he didn't think that Americans
were going to be reading that.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.989
That was actually for a French
audience and it sort of came

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.139
back across the ocean.
 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.204
So a lot of what I'm going to
be quoting here today,

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.310
he was not quoting for
Americans.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.824
He's actually speaking to the
French, which--You can say a lot

00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:23.214
of blunt things to the French
that you wouldn't necessarily

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:24.370
say to fellow Americans.
 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.947
So, okay.
 

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:28.665
In 1786, he wrote to a French
correspondent who clearly had

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:32.190
written to him in some way and
said, "Tell me about

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.410
America."
 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.327
So Jefferson writes back,
and I'm going to talk a little

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:40.389
bit about his view of all of the
states,

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.267
but in this particular instance
he writes back and says he's

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:47.817
very curious about why Rhode
Island is opposed to every

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.329
useful proposition.
 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:49.512
Okay.
 

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:50.649
I told you about Rhode Island.
 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:52.339
I forewarned you about Rhode
Island.

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:56.600
We have to have a Rhode Island
moment here because it appears--

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.627
it's going to appear again and
I mentioned also that

00:04:58.627 --> 00:05:00.259
Connecticut was going to appear
again--

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.680
Rhode Island was particularly
troublesome.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.723
It was actually the last state
to join the Union,

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.401
and it actually joined the
Union after the Constitution had

00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:12.240
already gone into effect.
 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.151
So when Washington becomes
President and he goes on his

00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.483
first grand triumphal tour--
'I will now go around the

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:22.050
nation showing everyone that I
am President"--

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.423
he first swings through the
North, and he actually refuses

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:27.004
to cross the border into Rhode
Island because Rhode Island is a

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:30.889
foreign country,
and he doesn't want to go there.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:31.069
Okay.
 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.589
He was making kind of a strong
statement.

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.053
Rhode Island wasn't really
happy about this but it was

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:38.029
their fault because they hadn't
ratified the Constitution yet.

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:42.322
A really popular thing to do at
the time in taverns was to drink

00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:45.416
12 toasts,
not 13, as a deliberate insult

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:47.362
to Rhode Island,
[laughter]

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.480
like -- 'so there,
Rhode Island.'

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.988
Of course, you also get to
drink 12 toasts that day,

00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:54.105
and that's the other happy
thing about that,

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:55.680
but at any rate--[laughter].
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.343
So Rhode Island is an issue,
and it's going to come up again

00:05:57.343 --> 00:05:57.709
today even.
 

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:00.560
So Jefferson was trying to
figure out, what is the deal

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.670
about Rhode Island?
 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.300
And here is what he--how he
explains it.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.211
Rhode Island's "geography
accounts for it with the aid of

00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.879
one or two observations.
 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.817
The cultivators of the earth
are the most virtuous

00:06:11.817 --> 00:06:12.490
citizens."
 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.829
(It's very Jeffersonian.)
 

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:16.800
Merchants are the least
virtuous.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.613
"The latter reside
principally in the seaport

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:22.139
towns, the former in the
interior country.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.740
Now, it happened that of the
territory constituting Rhode

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.290
Island and Connecticut,
the part containing the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.970
seaports was erected into a
State by itself,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.351
and called Rhode Island,
and that containing the

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.038
interior country was erected
into another State called

00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:35.850
Connecticut.
 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.009
For though it has a little
sea-coast, there are no good

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.569
ports in it.
 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.343
Hence it happens that there is
scarcely one merchant in the

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:44.416
whole State of Connecticut,
while there is not a single man

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.529
in Rhode Island who is not a
merchant of some sort,"

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:49.560
which is probably a little bit
of an exaggeration.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.899
"This circumstance has
decided the characters of the

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:56.300
two States and the remedies to
this evil are hazardous.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.029
One would be to consolidate the
two States into one."

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.391
Right?
 

00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.199
That's a really popular idea.
 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.382
"Another would be to
banish Rhode Island from the

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:03.959
Union."
 

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.810
[laughter]
Thank you, Thomas Jefferson.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.189
Is anyone here from Rhode
Island?

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.290
Are there no Rhode Islanders?
 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.810
Am I bashing safely?
 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.083
Wow.
 

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.480
[laughter]
No one can come get me.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.009
One time someone did say,
'Excuse me.

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:17.310
[laughter]
I'm from Rhode Island.'

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.956
[laughter]
So [laughs]

00:07:18.956 --> 00:07:19.661
I'm safe.
 

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.310
This is dangerous.
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.377
So number one,
you could consolidate

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.209
Connecticut and Rhode Island.
 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:27.129
Number two, you could banish
Rhode Island from the union.

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:30.661
Number three would be to compel
the submission of Rhode Island

00:07:30.661 --> 00:07:32.629
to the will of the other states.
 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.928
Right?
 

00:07:32.928 --> 00:07:35.620
He has an issue with Rhode
Island, but Rhode Island has

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.120
issues.
 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.016
He's speaking partly as a
southerner but a lot of other

00:07:39.016 --> 00:07:41.699
people had questions about Rhode
Island as well.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.490
At about the same time,
different French correspondent,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.163
once again Jefferson is writing
about the character of the

00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:49.413
northern states and the
character of the southern

00:07:49.413 --> 00:07:49.930
states.
 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.178
And Jefferson writes:
"In the North they are

00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:55.257
cool,
sober, laborious,

00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:57.699
persevering,
independent,

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.870
jealous of their own liberties
and just to those of others,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.262
interested, chicaning,
(cheating) superstitious and

00:08:04.262 --> 00:08:06.910
hypocritical in their
religion."

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.129
Thank you, Thomas Jefferson.
 

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:10.439
"In the South they are
fiery,

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:13.250
voluptuary, indolent,
unsteady, independent,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.904
zealous for their own liberties
but trampling on those of

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:17.264
others,
generous, candid,

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:19.973
without attachment or
pretensions to any religion but

00:08:19.973 --> 00:08:21.379
that of the heart."
 

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.129
Spoken like a Virginian.
 

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:25.192
And according to Jefferson,
as he explains to this

00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:27.146
Frenchman,
"An observing traveler

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:30.269
without the aid of a quadrant
may always know his latitude by

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:32.666
the character of the people
among whom he finds

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:33.759
himself"
--

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:36.491
like, he really believes that
it's very different people in

00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:37.668
the different colonies.
 

00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:40.000
And to Jefferson,
Pennsylvania was sort of the

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.109
perfect happy medium where the
two characters kind of met and

00:08:43.109 --> 00:08:45.129
blended and formed a people
which,

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:46.746
as he put it,
were "free from the

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:48.538
extremes both of vice and
virtue."

00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:51.418
Now, that's Jeffersonian
rhetoric.

00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:53.178
There's a lot of Jeffersonian
rhetoric.

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:56.357
George Washington,
a man of much fewer words,

00:08:56.357 --> 00:09:00.259
put his views about the North a
lot more succinctly.

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:00.610
Okay.
 

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.200
To Washington,
New Englanders were,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.899
as he put it in 1777,
right when he joined the

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.580
continental army,
and the continental army is in

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.488
Massachusetts--
Washington joins the army,

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.024
he heads up to Massachusetts
and the army is largely made of

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:15.241
New Englanders;
he confronts the army and he

00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.076
writes to a friend and says,
"New Englanders are an

00:09:18.076 --> 00:09:20.240
exceeding dirty and nasty
people."

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.470
[laughs] Okay. That's us.
 

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.710
[laughs]
Sorry, father of our country.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.250
We didn't live up to his
demands.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.389
Now New Englanders,
to be fair, had similar

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:32.408
feelings about the South.
 

00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:32.748
Right?
 

00:09:32.748 --> 00:09:35.571
They thought southerners were
snooty, aristocratic,

00:09:35.571 --> 00:09:36.080
proud.
 

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.985
I once in a diary came across a
passage in which there's a

00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:43.893
Pennsylvanian and he's sitting
at a dinner table with some

00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:46.336
Virginians,
and in his diary of course he's

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.033
complaining about this because
he says all they did through the

00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:50.860
entire dinner was talk about
gambling,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.985
horse racing,
Virginia ham and drinking and

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:56.740
drinking and drinking and
drinking.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.309
And apparently to this
Pennsylvanian I guess that's

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:03.309
what Virginia is,
gambling and drinking.

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:04.710
Virginia.
 

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.438
Now John Adams,
with a little bit of a dose of

00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:10.042
Puritan guilt,
felt that New Englanders were

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:13.296
the best trained in the school
of popular government but that

00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:16.168
they weren't really skilled in
personal relations.

00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:18.081
As he put it,
"New Englanders are

00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:19.923
awkward,
bashful, pert,

00:10:19.923 --> 00:10:23.472
ostentatious and vain,
a mixture which excites

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:25.490
ridicule and gives
disgust."

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.687
Some part of me thinks he was
speaking about himself,

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:28.830
which he could have been.
 

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.379
"Southerners,"
he claims,

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:34.284
"were skilled at display
and gentlemanly manners"

00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:36.840
but according to Adams
"they were habituated to

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.046
higher notions of themselves and
the distinction between them and

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:42.149
the common people than we
are."

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:44.340
So they're basically snootier
according to John Adams.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.499
So comments like all of these
are reminders about how very

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:52.440
different these sort of
colony-countries were from each

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.168
other.
 

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:56.336
They did each have different
distinctive characters and,

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:59.158
maybe equally important,
they often distrusted one

00:10:59.158 --> 00:10:59.850
another.
 

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.374
So in a sense,
colonies often had more of a

00:11:02.374 --> 00:11:05.860
connection with the mother
country than with each other.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.183
Now this is partly due to
pragmatic concerns like bad

00:11:09.183 --> 00:11:11.116
roads,
like the fact that there

00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:14.566
actually was not a huge bustling
amount of intercolonial trade

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:17.846
because colonies really did
focus their trading energies on

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:21.070
the mother country and not so
much with each other,

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.673
and then also there were a lot
of border conflicts between

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:28.150
colonies which caused distrust
and complications between

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.250
colonies and also helped to
discourage trade.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.269
Now the colonies were hostile
to each other because they were

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:39.211
seeing to their own interests,
but also, as kind of reflected

00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.038
in the comments that I opened
the lecture with,

00:11:42.038 --> 00:11:44.990
there also was just basic
cultural distrust.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.058
Now as I head into this,
it's worth noting that there

00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:51.009
actually were three different
types of colonies.

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:55.370
There were three different ways
in which colonies were founded,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.788
and these differences could
sometimes affect the structure

00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:02.269
of the colony and its relations
with the mother country.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:04.604
So this is going to be a very
quick and dirty version of these

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:05.600
three kinds of colonies.
 

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.575
Type of colony number one:
You had corporate colonies,

00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:13.923
like Connecticut and Rhode
Island, incorporated by Puritans

00:12:13.923 --> 00:12:15.950
who left Massachusetts.
 

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.778
And basically,
a corporate colony made its own

00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:21.543
constitution,
and it was then ratified by the

00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:22.110
King.
 

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.428
So these are independently
founded colonies.

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:29.833
They're clearly independent in
spirit, which makes them

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:34.320
potentially troublesome--not
potentially troublesome;

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.830
it just makes them troublesome.
 

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.558
So corporate colonies is type
of colony number one.

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:43.397
You also had proprietary
colonies, like Pennsylvania and

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:47.652
Maryland, where the King would
give ownership of the colony to

00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:48.490
someone.
 

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.182
So for example,
William Penn is the proprietor

00:12:51.182 --> 00:12:53.907
in Pennsylvania;
Lord Baltimore is the

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:55.788
proprietor in Maryland.
 

00:12:55.788 --> 00:13:00.182
So you have corporate colonies,
you have proprietary colonies,

00:13:00.182 --> 00:13:03.496
and the third kind of colony is
a royal colony,

00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:05.730
which is owned by the King.
 

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.700
So royal colonies include New
York,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.778
South Carolina,
North Carolina,

00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:11.349
Georgia,
Massachusetts,

00:13:11.349 --> 00:13:14.124
just the whole range of
colonies that I basically

00:13:14.124 --> 00:13:16.610
haven't named in those earlier
colonies.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.240
A lot of these colonies were
royal colonies;

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.580
they were owned by the King.
 

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.096
Now of the three,
in some ways corporate colonies

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:28.418
were the closest to what would
eventually become states,

00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:31.779
because corporate colonies had
drawn up their own constitution;

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:32.980
they made their own charter.
 

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.706
And what that actually--and the
charter was made by the people

00:13:35.706 --> 00:13:36.870
who lived in the colony.
 

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.472
And what that actually means,
is once independence is

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:44.144
declared and all of these
newly-created states need to

00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:48.580
create a new constitution which
writes out royal authority,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.523
Connecticut kind of had its own
little charter and Rhode Island

00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:52.519
too, to begin with.
 

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:55.080
They kind of were already there
as little independent entities.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.450
They were a little ahead of the
game.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.071
They sort of had their own
constitution that needed a

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:01.188
little tweaking,
but really all these other

00:14:01.188 --> 00:14:03.610
colonies were sort of starting
from scratch.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:03.908
Okay.
 

00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:06.899
So those are kind of basic
structural institutional

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:10.070
differences between these three
kinds of colonies.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.893
But beyond their basic
structure, there are also things

00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:17.999
about the social structure and
the culture of the different

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:21.964
regions of the colonies that
differentiated them and bred

00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:23.379
some distrust.
 

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:27.169
So let's just look for just a
few minutes at the different

00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:30.028
regions and let's start with New
England.

00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:34.234
Now logically enough--this is
not a surprise--New England had

00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:37.317
the most structured
institutional base of the

00:14:37.317 --> 00:14:40.259
colonies because of its Puritan
roots.

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:42.748
So just think about the whole
idea of a New England town,

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.570
and that's what I'm talking
about here.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.638
In general, New England
colonies were divided into

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:50.116
townships;
each township was oriented

00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:51.379
around the church.
 

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:54.918
Traditionally speaking,
your church fathers were your

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:55.940
town fathers.
 

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.928
The church felt responsible not
only for your soul in church but

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:03.538
also for your soul as displayed
in your everyday life,

00:15:03.538 --> 00:15:06.187
so there actually were church
officials who sometimes went

00:15:06.187 --> 00:15:09.070
from home to home to be sure
that you were living properly,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.389
abiding by godly standards of
living--

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:14.794
and that's a sort of really
strong institutional base of

00:15:14.794 --> 00:15:15.600
settlement.
 

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.788
Now as commerce boomed in New
England,

00:15:18.788 --> 00:15:21.158
the sort of pure
church-orientation of New

00:15:21.158 --> 00:15:23.700
England society got a little bit
diluted,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.966
but still, it had an enormous
impact on the tone of life in

00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:28.320
the northern colonies.
 

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.085
Also, because of New England's
Puritan roots and the Puritan

00:15:32.085 --> 00:15:35.340
respect for the word as
presented in the Bible --

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.134
and you needed to be able to
read and understand the Bible

00:15:38.134 --> 00:15:41.654
for yourself--
literacy was particularly high

00:15:41.654 --> 00:15:44.298
in the New England colonies.
 

00:15:44.298 --> 00:15:47.759
And New England colleges,
Harvard and Yale,

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:51.581
were generally superior to most
of the other colleges at the

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.235
time,
although King's College in New

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:54.525
York,
which is now Columbia,

00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:57.865
and the College of New Jersey,
which is now Princeton,

00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.308
also ranked high.
 

00:15:59.308 --> 00:16:01.197
William and Mary in Virginia
was kind of in a different

00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:02.769
league and I'm going to come
back to that,

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:07.029
and also to UVA,
which is where I got my Ph.D.,

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:08.788
in a few minutes.
 

00:16:08.788 --> 00:16:14.058
Now New England was mostly
composed of small farms

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:17.070
supported by family labor.
 

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.741
And there was some slave labor;
it was the least in all of the

00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:25.210
colonies, and there were roughly
thirty-five white Europeans to

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.580
every one slave.
 

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.389
Because of its original Puritan
origins--

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:34.538
so, because of its original
focus on excluding all but the

00:16:34.538 --> 00:16:37.798
like-minded who shared their
religious sense of purpose--

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:41.624
New England was not really
diverse religiously or

00:16:41.624 --> 00:16:42.658
ethnically.
 

00:16:42.658 --> 00:16:44.298
And it was this lack of
diversity,

00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:47.490
the kind of insular nature of
New England society,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.090
that made many people think of
New Englanders as kind of--

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.100
well, their word for it was
unmixed--

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.910
sort of stiff and awkward:
they're not used to being out

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.859
in the world,
they don't know how to have

00:16:56.859 --> 00:16:58.908
conversations with people who
aren't like them,

00:16:58.908 --> 00:17:01.799
they're sort of weird because
they only know other New

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.509
Englanders.
 

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:05.722
But, the same sort of relative
lack of diversity also allowed

00:17:05.722 --> 00:17:09.096
New Englanders to unite quickly
and powerfully if they felt that

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:11.400
their rights were being impinged
upon,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.630
as we'll see during the first
phases of the Revolution,

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.650
within the next week or so.
 

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.558
So that's New England.
 

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:22.268
The middle colonies in at least
one way were the precise

00:17:22.268 --> 00:17:26.179
opposite of New England because
they were actually the most

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:28.538
diverse of all of the colonies.
 

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:31.582
The middle colonies were
flooded by immigrants from

00:17:31.582 --> 00:17:33.771
Germany, from Ireland,
from Scotland,

00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:35.779
to name just a few countries.
 

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:39.088
And as a matter of fact the
middle colonies were considered,

00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:42.563
in a phrase used at the time,
"the best poor man's

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:44.942
country"
because there were ample

00:17:44.942 --> 00:17:48.480
supplies of land and there
weren't harsh restrictions or

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.858
great intolerance of diversity.
 

00:17:50.858 --> 00:17:54.375
And part of the reason why it
was so popular for immigrants is

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:57.835
because of the great tolerance
of the Quakers who founded the

00:17:57.835 --> 00:17:58.470
colony.
 

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.798
Though Pennsylvania,
like Massachusetts,

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:05.160
was founded by basically a
group of religious dissenters,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.440
the Quaker faith was quite
different from Puritanism.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.997
And it was much more focused on
regulating society according to

00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:14.578
your internal moral spirit
rather than through

00:18:14.578 --> 00:18:17.805
institutional,
sort of church-oriented

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:18.920
structures.
 

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.288
So there were fewer external
rules and regulations

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:24.383
controlling Pennsylvania society
in the way there would have been

00:18:24.383 --> 00:18:26.873
in New England,
and it was a lot easier for

00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:30.202
people who arrived in the middle
colonies to adapt to living

00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:30.710
there.
 

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.872
And tolerance was also integral
to the Quaker faith,

00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:37.404
so again, it's easier for
immigrants to deal with arriving

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:39.078
to the middle colonies.
 

00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:42.262
Also the middle colonies,
unlike New England and the

00:18:42.262 --> 00:18:45.259
South, were kind of less of a
coherent region.

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:48.740
And particularly New York and
Pennsylvania,

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.190
although they're both lumped
into middle colony-ness,

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.150
they seemed to share fewer
similarities,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.199
and it's why at the time you
don't really hear people

00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:59.308
dividing the colonies into
thirds.

00:18:59.308 --> 00:19:02.913
They do tend to break it into
halves and they do tend to talk

00:19:02.913 --> 00:19:06.215
about northern or eastern
colonies and southern colonies

00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:09.218
and they sort of shove
Pennsylvania north and shove

00:19:09.218 --> 00:19:12.730
Maryland south,
obviously thinking generally

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.019
about slavery as a helpful
dividing line.

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:19.221
Now that said,
to people at the time New York

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:23.079
was particularly problematic,
and in some ways some people

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.578
actually considered New York to
be more southern than northern.

00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:28.670
Jefferson actually said that at
the time.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.093
He thought that New York was in
the wrong place--that somehow

00:19:31.093 --> 00:19:33.516
geographically it ended up far
more north than it should have

00:19:33.516 --> 00:19:33.880
been.
 

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.420
It should be a southern state.
 

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.617
And what he meant by that was:
unlike a lot of other states or

00:19:38.617 --> 00:19:40.720
colonies actually,
not yet states,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.252
colonies, it was organized
around great landowners who

00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:46.318
owned vast expanses of land.
 

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.425
And although in all of the
colonies there were sort of

00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:52.825
great families who controlled or
who certainly had a lot of

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.828
power,
in New York politics was really

00:19:55.828 --> 00:20:00.395
largely organized around the
clash between a handful of great

00:20:00.395 --> 00:20:01.308
families.
 

00:20:01.308 --> 00:20:04.607
And the Livingstons are the
sort of largest and most

00:20:04.607 --> 00:20:07.259
noteworthy political clan in New
York,

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:10.372
and I can vouch to you as a
historian of this time period

00:20:10.372 --> 00:20:13.374
that when you're studying New
York politics there are a

00:20:13.374 --> 00:20:16.318
million Livingstons and they're
all named Philip.

00:20:16.318 --> 00:20:17.627
[laughs]
Trying to tell which Livingston

00:20:17.627 --> 00:20:18.868
is which Livingston is really
hard.

00:20:18.868 --> 00:20:22.064
There are a lot of Livingstons
and they all--a lot of them are

00:20:22.064 --> 00:20:22.640
in power.
 

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.906
Other people commented not
necessarily that New York seemed

00:20:26.906 --> 00:20:29.032
southern,
but that it had really

00:20:29.032 --> 00:20:31.961
high-toned manners,
that the people were really

00:20:31.961 --> 00:20:34.345
aristocratic,
that they were very interested

00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:37.128
in fine living and display than
some of the surrounding more

00:20:37.128 --> 00:20:38.118
northern colonies.
 

00:20:38.118 --> 00:20:40.916
And some people considered New
Yorkers shifty,

00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:42.720
self-interested and subtle.
 

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.263
There's one account I came
across in which this fellows

00:20:46.263 --> 00:20:48.441
says--
basically he says he thinks New

00:20:48.441 --> 00:20:51.221
Yorkers are all liars,
but the way he puts it is

00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.866
something like:
New Yorkers are all guilty of

00:20:53.866 --> 00:20:55.994
telling great thumpers,
[laughs]

00:20:55.994 --> 00:20:58.650
and I guess a great thumper is
a big lie.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.940
And actually that same
diary--Okay.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.660
This really surprised me.
 

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.970
I suppose -- you know,
very often--this is true with

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.304
slang too--
you consider slang or other

00:21:07.304 --> 00:21:09.578
things as being really,
really modern,

00:21:09.578 --> 00:21:12.170
and then you discover it
actually isn't really modern;

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.450
it dates all the way back.
 

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.897
I found a letter once from this
time period in which someone

00:21:15.897 --> 00:21:17.055
said,
"I wanted to give

00:21:17.055 --> 00:21:18.778
So-and-So a good swift kick in
the can."

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:19.056
Right?
 

00:21:19.056 --> 00:21:19.286
Okay.
 

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:21.219
I don't expect someone to say
that in 1799,

00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:23.288
"a good swift kick in the
can."

00:21:23.288 --> 00:21:26.390
The can?--they're saying
that--I don't know.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.861
It's a little sort of more cas
than I thought they would be in

00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.259
1799.
 

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:33.993
But so in this diary account
this person is talking about New

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:34.430
York.
 

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.106
He's a Pennsylvanian and he
says New Yorkers talk really

00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:41.650
fast, walk really fast,
they do everything really fast

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.720
in New York.
 

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.118
They're sort of really
businesslike and abrupt.

00:21:45.118 --> 00:21:47.182
It actually just doesn't sound
very different from what someone

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.180
today would say visiting New
York City for the first time.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.493
But he also describes--and now
I'm going to embarrass myself

00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:54.756
fully--
he also describes what he calls

00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:57.307
the New York walk,
which in his mind--He thinks

00:21:57.307 --> 00:22:01.380
all New Yorkers walk this way,
which I guess is kind of bent

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.134
over and walking very fast,
so in his--and he does a little

00:22:05.134 --> 00:22:05.848
imitation of it.
 

00:22:05.848 --> 00:22:07.440
Apparently, in his diary he
talks about it.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.230
So he is looking at New York.
 

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.326
Basically his impression--you
almost could read someone today

00:22:13.326 --> 00:22:16.808
making a very similar
observation about New York.

00:22:16.808 --> 00:22:18.509
So New York,
Pennsylvania,

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:20.890
middle colonies:
a bit different.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.992
Considering though,
these differences between New

00:22:23.992 --> 00:22:26.353
York and Pennsylvania,
years later,

00:22:26.353 --> 00:22:28.460
after the Constitution kicks
in,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.066
they actually become an
enormous issue because they

00:22:31.066 --> 00:22:34.192
begin to play into the question
of where the national capital

00:22:34.192 --> 00:22:35.338
should be located.
 

00:22:35.338 --> 00:22:38.108
Because the general belief at
the time was,

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:41.404
wherever the capital ended up
being located would determine

00:22:41.404 --> 00:22:44.243
the manners of the national
office-holders and thus

00:22:44.243 --> 00:22:47.710
determine the sort of manner and
character of the nation.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.965
Right?
 

00:22:47.965 --> 00:22:50.490
So, wherever you're living is
going to shape how you act--

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.019
so the national office holders
are going to act--

00:22:53.019 --> 00:22:54.798
if they're in New York--kind of
snooty,

00:22:54.798 --> 00:22:56.865
and then the American public's
going to look at these snooty

00:22:56.865 --> 00:22:59.140
people and they're going to try
to act like the snooty people,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.480
and thus all of America will
become aristocratic and corrupt

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.423
and that's the end of the
republican experiment in

00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:04.019
government.
 

00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:04.295
Darn.
 

00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:04.625
Right?
 

00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:07.936
So that was kind of the logic
at the time so people had a lot

00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:11.358
of attitudes about whether the
capital should be in New York or

00:23:11.358 --> 00:23:15.250
should be in Philadelphia,
actually in Pennsylvania.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.513
The idea being that
Pennsylvania seemed more ideal

00:23:17.513 --> 00:23:19.269
because it's sort of in the
middle,

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:21.683
it seems kind of balanced,
people said it seemed the most

00:23:21.683 --> 00:23:23.150
small "r"
republican,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.108
meaning sort of virtuous and
straightforward and uncorrupted.

00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:29.766
So it's not as though these
issues die out when we get

00:23:29.766 --> 00:23:30.920
states and a country.
 

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.665
But now southerners might
disagree and might say,

00:23:33.665 --> 00:23:34.009
'No.
 

00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:36.328
Pennsylvania is of course not
the most republican.

00:23:36.328 --> 00:23:41.874
We in the South are the most
republican, the most virtuous of

00:23:41.874 --> 00:23:43.259
all regions.'
 

00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:45.821
Of course, other colonists from
other regions would have

00:23:45.821 --> 00:23:47.500
disagreed and would have
claimed,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.650
as many did,
that the South was aristocratic

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.663
in the extreme,
that they had a true haughty

00:23:52.663 --> 00:23:56.250
aristocratic elite,
plantation owners and then a

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.108
glut of poor common folk.
 

00:23:58.108 --> 00:24:01.189
Not surprisingly--this is not
going to be a surprise to

00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:03.865
anyone--
southern society was structured

00:24:03.865 --> 00:24:07.397
around widely-scattered
plantations which essentially

00:24:07.397 --> 00:24:11.609
functioned like small villages
owned and controlled by southern

00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:12.630
gentlemen.
 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.268
And it was these gentlemen who
controlled and regulated

00:24:16.268 --> 00:24:18.250
affairs,
who did things like take

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.460
responsibility for fixing roads
or tending to local affairs,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.075
rather than having some kind of
formal institution tending to

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:27.075
those things,
as might have happened in a

00:24:27.075 --> 00:24:29.143
place that was more structured--
institutionally

00:24:29.143 --> 00:24:30.750
structured--like New England.
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.592
And these southern gentlemen
really did enjoy great display

00:24:34.592 --> 00:24:36.778
in their homes,
in their clothing,

00:24:36.778 --> 00:24:38.700
in their style of living.
 

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.723
They spent their leisure time
gambling, cock fighting,

00:24:42.723 --> 00:24:45.912
horse racing and,
as that diarist suggests,

00:24:45.912 --> 00:24:46.900
drinking.
 

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.873
Now generally speaking,
education was not as important

00:24:49.873 --> 00:24:53.127
in the South as in the North,
which is not to say gentlemen

00:24:53.127 --> 00:24:54.980
were expected to be educated.
 

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.680
They were in the South,
but going to school at William

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.075
and Mary was sometimes more
social training than

00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:01.400
intellectual training.
 

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.587
I'm sorry, William and Mary.
 

00:25:02.587 --> 00:25:03.818
I do not mean to insult you.
 

00:25:03.818 --> 00:25:05.942
But for one,
Thomas Jefferson was really not

00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:08.509
impressed with his education at
William and Mary,

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:10.913
and ultimately,
he created in his old age the

00:25:10.913 --> 00:25:14.027
University of Virginia because
he wanted to create what he

00:25:14.027 --> 00:25:16.866
considered to be a better
academic institution in the

00:25:16.866 --> 00:25:20.200
state of Virginia where people
would be truly learning.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.790
This will be a temple of
learning, the University of

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.348
Virginia.
 

00:25:23.348 --> 00:25:23.607
Okay.
 

00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:26.555
Things didn't work out the way
he planned initially at the

00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:27.900
University of Virginia.
 

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.390
There was a lot of drinking,
a lot of gambling.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.482
I think--I can't remember
whether Edgar Allan Poe was

00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:37.616
thrown out for drinking or
gambling or both but he was

00:25:37.616 --> 00:25:40.073
expelled from the University of
Virginia for doing one or both

00:25:40.073 --> 00:25:41.118
of those two things.
 

00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:44.323
Students really liked,
at UVA--I don't know if any of

00:25:44.323 --> 00:25:46.702
you have been there,
but there is sort of this

00:25:46.702 --> 00:25:48.279
beautiful lawn at the center of
campus--

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:50.952
students really liked to ride
up and down the lawn on their

00:25:50.952 --> 00:25:52.750
horses and shoot guns off in the
air.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.348
This was a popular hobby.
 

00:25:54.348 --> 00:25:56.645
Things got really bad
apparently with the guns and the

00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:58.760
horses,
so Thomas Jefferson in 1825

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.498
called a meeting of the faculty
and students so that he could

00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:03.618
reprimand them.
 

00:26:03.618 --> 00:26:06.778
This is the hobby and delight
of his old age,

00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:09.653
his--what he's going to give to
his own colony or state of

00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:11.365
Virginia,
and now just wacky people

00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:13.886
riding around shooting guns and
not really going to class,

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:14.328
per se.
 

00:26:14.328 --> 00:26:18.269
So he calls this meeting of
students and faculty and he

00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:21.700
invites along James Monroe and
James Madison.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:21.982
Okay.
 

00:26:21.982 --> 00:26:24.702
So we've got three
ex-Presidents who are standing

00:26:24.702 --> 00:26:28.160
over the Virginia student body
who are going to reprimand them

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.028
for shooting off their guns.
 

00:26:30.028 --> 00:26:32.977
And supposedly--I always find
this sort of touching.

00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:33.440
Right?
 

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.518
Supposedly, Thomas Jefferson
stood up to yell at the students

00:26:36.518 --> 00:26:39.750
but he was so upset at what was
happening at the university that

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.058
he started to cry and he had to
sit down.

00:26:42.058 --> 00:26:45.470
[laughter]
So okay, crying Founders.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.650
So he was very upset and then
one of the Jameses--I don't know

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.099
if it was Madison or
Monroe--sort of had to take

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:51.568
over.
 

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:54.715
Now you would think that a
crying Founder might help the

00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:58.318
student body at Virginia to kind
of shape up, but it did not.

00:26:58.318 --> 00:27:03.009
And years later when faculty
told the still-rioting,

00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:05.528
gun-shooting students that they
needed to actually give up their

00:27:05.528 --> 00:27:07.769
guns now because they apparently
just didn't want to stop

00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:10.738
shooting them,
there was some kind of a gun

00:27:10.738 --> 00:27:12.788
riot, [laughter]
a riot,

00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:15.895
like crashing windows and--I
don't know the details but it

00:27:15.895 --> 00:27:17.942
was ugly,
and seventy students were

00:27:17.942 --> 00:27:18.500
expelled.
 

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.348
Four years after the amazing
gun riot,

00:27:22.348 --> 00:27:26.288
when students were celebrating
the anniversary of the gun riot,

00:27:26.288 --> 00:27:28.492
[laughter]
which kind of tells you that

00:27:28.492 --> 00:27:31.509
people being expelled really
didn't do a lot for--

00:27:31.509 --> 00:27:32.848
[laughter]
This gets really unfortunate.

00:27:32.848 --> 00:27:35.339
They were celebrating the
anniversary of the gun riot and

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:37.430
a professor was accidentally
shot and killed.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.631
[laughter]
So, [laughter]

00:27:40.631 --> 00:27:42.900
it's a problem.
 

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.910
It's UVA, the early years.
 

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:46.323
Right?
 

00:27:46.323 --> 00:27:49.838
It's a problem--unfortunate
problem with the guns.

00:27:49.838 --> 00:27:50.155
Okay.
 

00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:52.628
[laughs]
Virginia education in the early

00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:53.200
years.
 

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.328
So, as with the other regions,
southern

00:27:55.328 --> 00:27:58.412
colonists--colonies--were
distinctive in many ways other

00:27:58.412 --> 00:28:00.430
than crazy, gun-toting students.
 

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:04.874
Of course, slavery had an
enormous impact on the tone of

00:28:04.874 --> 00:28:06.490
life in the South.
 

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.468
There were between 1.3 and 1.7
white Europeans to every slave

00:28:10.468 --> 00:28:13.916
in the South and in some
colonies like South Carolina

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.568
there actually was a black
majority.

00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:20.854
To Jefferson,
slavery corrupted the morals of

00:28:20.854 --> 00:28:22.893
the South,
and once again,

00:28:22.893 --> 00:28:25.938
he says this in Notes on the
State of Virginia to his

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:28.176
French audience,
so he certainly writes things

00:28:28.176 --> 00:28:30.548
there that he would not have
said to a fellow Virginian.

00:28:30.548 --> 00:28:33.284
And in this case this is what
he writes in Notes:

00:28:33.284 --> 00:28:35.066
"There must doubtless be

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:37.829
an unhappy influence on the
manners of our people produced

00:28:37.829 --> 00:28:39.769
by the existence of slavery
among us.

00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:42.952
The whole commerce between
master and slave is a perpetual

00:28:42.952 --> 00:28:45.410
exercise of the most boisterous
passions,

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.615
the most unremitting deposition
on the one part and degrading

00:28:48.615 --> 00:28:50.058
submissions on the other.
 

00:28:50.058 --> 00:28:53.463
Our children see this and learn
to imitate it for man is an

00:28:53.463 --> 00:28:54.578
imitative animal.
 

00:28:54.578 --> 00:28:57.410
The parent storms,
the child looks on,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.240
puts on the same airs in the
circle of smaller slaves,

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.558
gives a loose to his worst of
passions,

00:29:02.558 --> 00:29:05.439
and thus nursed,
educated and daily exercised in

00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:09.358
tyranny cannot but be stamped by
it with odious peculiarities.

00:29:09.358 --> 00:29:13.161
The man must be a prodigy who
can retain his manners and

00:29:13.161 --> 00:29:16.480
morals undepraved by such
circumstances."

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.247
So that's Jefferson,
Notes on the State of

00:29:18.247 --> 00:29:20.256
Virginia,
in a really strong passage

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:23.205
about the influence of slavery
on the morals and manners of

00:29:23.205 --> 00:29:23.970
southerners.
 

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.461
So clearly the South is based
on the mastery,

00:29:27.461 --> 00:29:31.269
literally and figuratively,
of a ruling elite.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:35.684
And it's this spirit of
entitlement and independence and

00:29:35.684 --> 00:29:40.743
mastery that would inspire some
of the emotional response in the

00:29:40.743 --> 00:29:45.160
South to Britain's actions in
the 1760s and 1770s,

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.701
particularly in Virginia,
which was the colony that

00:29:47.701 --> 00:29:50.650
really believed itself to be at
the top of the hierarchy of

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.700
southern colonies,
the leader of the South.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.798
The response of Virginia to
what they perceived to be the

00:29:56.798 --> 00:29:59.730
impingement of Britain upon
their rights was second in

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.776
intensity,
as we're going to see,

00:30:01.776 --> 00:30:04.871
only to what took place in
Massachusetts and particularly

00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:05.588
in Boston.
 

00:30:05.588 --> 00:30:09.574
So you can now begin to see how
really diverse these different

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:13.362
regions and colonies were and
you can also begin to see why

00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:16.888
when different men from
different regions came together

00:30:16.888 --> 00:30:20.807
in something like ultimately a
continental congress they were

00:30:20.807 --> 00:30:24.269
pretty quick to pick up on those
differences.

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:26.963
And New Englanders picked apart
the southerners as being

00:30:26.963 --> 00:30:29.805
arrogant and wearing flashy
clothes and southerners thought

00:30:29.805 --> 00:30:32.548
the New Englanders were strange
and awkward and everybody

00:30:32.548 --> 00:30:35.144
distrusted the New Yorkers and
everybody smiled at the

00:30:35.144 --> 00:30:38.078
Pennsylvanians,
but all of these [laughter]

00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:41.727
things were pretty prominent in
any kind of a continental

00:30:41.727 --> 00:30:42.769
organization.
 

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:46.028
So with all of these big
differences you can begin to see

00:30:46.028 --> 00:30:49.693
how truly amazing and noteworthy
would have been any attempts at

00:30:49.693 --> 00:30:50.798
colonial unity.
 

00:30:50.798 --> 00:30:54.280
And what I'm going to do right
now is just talk very briefly

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.821
about these three attempts at
colonial unity that I mentioned

00:30:57.821 --> 00:30:59.769
at the outset of the lecture.
 

00:30:59.769 --> 00:31:01.835
Two of them,
as we'll see,

00:31:01.835 --> 00:31:06.710
were inspired by the colonies
as a means of self-defense.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.432
One of them was basically
created by the British,

00:31:10.432 --> 00:31:15.009
not surprisingly as a means of
asserting British control.

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:17.309
But what's really most
important to note in these

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:20.568
examples that I'm going to offer
you here is: generally speaking,

00:31:20.568 --> 00:31:24.107
when American colonists
considered colonial union on

00:31:24.107 --> 00:31:27.368
their own it was for reasons of
self-defense.

00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:30.736
It was for reasons of
self-interest and not because of

00:31:30.736 --> 00:31:32.960
some greater ideological
calling;

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.670
it was really for basic
self-defense.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.843
So let's look at the first
attempt at colonial union,

00:31:39.843 --> 00:31:42.009
which took place in 1643.
 

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:42.365
Okay.
 

00:31:42.365 --> 00:31:46.566
So in 1643, representatives of
the colonies of Massachusetts

00:31:46.566 --> 00:31:48.416
Bay, Plymouth,
Connecticut,

00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:52.759
and New Haven -- New Haven is
its own little settlement.

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:55.036
I--It happens several times in
this course that New Haven just

00:31:55.036 --> 00:31:57.045
appears all by itself,
which I always kind of love

00:31:57.045 --> 00:31:59.395
because you just don't expect it
to sort of sit there all by

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:00.990
itself having historical
prominence,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.009
but here it is.
 

00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:04.940
So Massachusetts Bay,
Plymouth, Connecticut,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.803
and New Haven decided that they
wanted to form a confederation

00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:12.286
to defend themselves against
Dutch expansion and hostile

00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:15.057
Indian tribes,
and to create some kind of

00:32:15.057 --> 00:32:17.769
forum for resolving
intercolonial disputes,

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:20.019
which happened all the time.
 

00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:23.125
Rhode Island tried to join the
forum [laughs]

00:32:23.125 --> 00:32:27.218
but it was excluded [laughter]
because nobody trusted Rhode

00:32:27.218 --> 00:32:30.323
Island [laughter]
so they were not invited to

00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:31.098
join.
 

00:32:31.098 --> 00:32:35.960
The union, known as the United
Colonies of New England,

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.512
or the New England
Confederation,

00:32:38.512 --> 00:32:43.779
didn't have any sanction in the
charters of its member colonies.

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:47.531
Instead it was just a kind of
joint advisory council and it

00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:51.480
was made up of two members from
each participating colony,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.957
so basically it had eight
people in it,

00:32:54.957 --> 00:32:55.690
right?
 

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.726
And six of the eight had to
vote for something for it to

00:32:58.726 --> 00:32:59.500
take effect.
 

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:05.883
So between 1643 and 1664,
the United Colonies of New

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:08.681
England,
or the New England

00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:10.338
Confederation,
met--

00:33:10.338 --> 00:33:13.400
between those years,
1643 and 1664--

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.619
until Connecticut annexed New
Haven and the number of members

00:33:17.619 --> 00:33:21.769
decreased and went down to six
and this became a problem.

00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:24.403
So after 1664,
when New Haven sort of merged

00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:27.131
with Connecticut,
it didn't meet very often and

00:33:27.131 --> 00:33:29.980
then ultimately in 1684 it kind
of drifted to an end,

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.650
the end of the United Colonies
of New England.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.250
So that's amazing first attempt
at union.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.630
It was an attempt.
 

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.758
The second union of a sort was
spurred by the British

00:33:40.758 --> 00:33:43.654
government,
which in the 1680s became

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:47.723
worried that the New England
colonies were not sympathetic

00:33:47.723 --> 00:33:51.078
and loyal to the British monarch
and we're--

00:33:51.078 --> 00:33:52.640
basically we're creeping up
here on--

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.608
I'm not going to go into it in
any detail but--

00:33:54.608 --> 00:33:57.019
on what comes to be known as
the Glorious Revolution,

00:33:57.019 --> 00:33:59.550
when the monarchy falls,
so there's a reason why they're

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.358
wondering how loyal the New
Englanders are to the monarchy.

00:34:02.358 --> 00:34:04.923
But British authorities wanted
to be sure that the New England

00:34:04.923 --> 00:34:07.318
colonies were going to be loyal
to the British monarch.

00:34:07.318 --> 00:34:10.836
So in 1686, the British
government formed what they

00:34:10.836 --> 00:34:13.510
called the Dominion of New
England,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.268
which to me sounds like sort of
Darth Vader,

00:34:16.268 --> 00:34:18.250
"Star Wars"-- the
"Dominion."

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.670
So they formed the Dominion of
New England,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:25.144
1686, which fused all of the
New England colonies plus New

00:34:25.144 --> 00:34:29.856
York plus New Jersey into one
colony to be ruled by one royal

00:34:29.856 --> 00:34:32.840
governor and an appointed
council.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.469
That's a dramatic gesture.
 

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:38.463
The resulting mass that was
made by merging all of that into

00:34:38.463 --> 00:34:41.510
one colony was larger in size
than England.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.905
Okay.
 

00:34:41.905 --> 00:34:44.829
That's a lot of land,
a lot of land.

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:49.128
The newly-installed royal
governor was named Edmund

00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:51.018
Andros, A-n-d-r-o-s.
 

00:34:51.018 --> 00:34:54.541
Andros ruled over the Dominion
without a legislature,

00:34:54.541 --> 00:34:58.402
passing laws after they were
approved by a majority of his

00:34:58.402 --> 00:34:59.420
councilors.
 

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.347
You can see how happy this is
going to make the New

00:35:01.347 --> 00:35:01.849
Englanders.
 

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:04.170
Not surprisingly,
a lot of New Englanders

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.592
resented the dominion and the
way it just sort of supplanted

00:35:07.592 --> 00:35:09.099
colonial legislatures.
 

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:12.001
Even more unfortunate,
Andros was not a very

00:35:12.001 --> 00:35:15.646
diplomatic politician and he
really had no reason to be

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:16.659
diplomatic.
 

00:35:16.659 --> 00:35:19.251
He was sent to New England on
royal authority,

00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:22.532
his job was to assert royal
authority, so he really didn't

00:35:22.532 --> 00:35:25.010
need to please anybody except
the King.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.146
Even so, he somehow seemed
intent on really proving his

00:35:28.146 --> 00:35:31.050
authority by flaunting it before
New Englanders.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.070
So for example,
not long after he arrived,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:35.829
Andros took over a Puritan
meeting house and converted it

00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:37.210
into an Anglican church.
 

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:37.581
Right?
 

00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:39.992
Nothing like a little 'ha,
you Puritans,

00:35:39.992 --> 00:35:43.208
you think you control the
Dominion, but I control the

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:45.250
Dominion,' dramatic gesture.
 

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:49.231
He also put the colonial
militia under the direct control

00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:51.079
of the governor himself.
 

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:54.467
And there were a number of
other highly unpopular things

00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:55.329
that he did.
 

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.842
But in 1689 when the Stuart
monarchy fell in England because

00:35:58.842 --> 00:36:01.934
of the Glorious Revolution,
American colonists also

00:36:01.934 --> 00:36:04.829
revolted and they toppled the
Dominion government;

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:07.952
they jailed its officers
including Andros,

00:36:07.952 --> 00:36:11.989
who supposedly tried to escape
in women's clothing.

00:36:11.989 --> 00:36:12.614
[laughter]
Okay.

00:36:12.614 --> 00:36:13.989
So that's somewhat humiliating.
 

00:36:13.989 --> 00:36:16.231
Even more humiliating,
he was caught,

00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:17.478
[laughs]
poor Andros,

00:36:17.478 --> 00:36:21.340
and he is eventually freed and
not surprisingly fled right back

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.400
to England.
 

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.543
And soon after,
Britain just let the colonies

00:36:24.543 --> 00:36:27.224
resume their former status so
end of the Dominion of New

00:36:27.224 --> 00:36:27.809
England.
 

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:30.440
That's a really obviously
whopping big success.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.012
The third and last attempt at
union is in 1754,

00:36:34.012 --> 00:36:37.894
and like the first one,
it was largely because of a

00:36:37.894 --> 00:36:38.750
threat.
 

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.096
And this time,
colonies were afraid of threats

00:36:42.096 --> 00:36:45.219
coming from the French and from
Indians.

00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:48.802
And here we have the not really
promising entry of George

00:36:48.802 --> 00:36:51.809
Washington on to the colonial
military scene.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.992
I'm going to draw a little
picture to you of George

00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:56.349
Washington's moment of glory at
this moment in time.

00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.740
Okay.
 

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.266
So in 1753,1754,
there were some skirmishes on

00:37:00.266 --> 00:37:04.260
the Pennsylvania frontier
because French forces were

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.610
moving south from Quebec.
 

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.039
And Virginia militia under the
command of George Washington--

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:12.072
a young and,
as we will hear,

00:37:12.072 --> 00:37:15.318
inexperienced officer--
he's sent out by the governor

00:37:15.318 --> 00:37:18.322
of Virginia to investigate and
see what's happening with these

00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:20.489
sort of French movements on the
frontier.

00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:23.280
So Washington and his men
apparently tramp around the

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.072
frontier for a while and
ultimately they find a small

00:37:26.072 --> 00:37:29.400
party of French soldiers in an
encampment and they open fire on

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.960
them and kill a lot of them,
and then discover unfortunately

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.376
after the fact that actually it
was a neutral ambassador holding

00:37:36.376 --> 00:37:40.329
papers for a negotiation,
and his diplomatic escort.

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:40.670
Okay.
 

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.190
[laughter]
So Washington just killed a

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.664
bunch of diplomats and their
escort and the diplomat

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:50.409
literally died clutching papers
to negotiate Okay.

00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:52.268
[laughter]
Thank you, George Washington.

00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:54.447
So Washington,
after this glorious moment,

00:37:54.447 --> 00:37:57.579
decides he's going to pull back
and he's going to encamp his

00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.969
troops in a fort that he will
have built.

00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:00.295
Right?
 

00:38:00.295 --> 00:38:03.550
So he has troops build a fort
and he names it Fort Necessity,

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.800
which it really was.
 

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.018
Right?
 

00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:06.989
He just killed people he
shouldn't have been killing;

00:38:06.989 --> 00:38:10.318
now he'd better create a fort,
so he creates Fort Necessity,

00:38:10.318 --> 00:38:12.746
but unfortunately for
Washington he built it

00:38:12.746 --> 00:38:14.440
in--basically in a valley.
 

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.460
Okay, fort in valley,
just not good.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.646
He didn't really think very
hard about the places up above

00:38:21.646 --> 00:38:25.000
the fort where the French could
perch and fire down in to the

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.960
fort,
which of course they did. Right?

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.585
[laughter]
He also didn't think about the

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:31.063
fact that if it's in a valley if
it rains, it's really bad for

00:38:31.063 --> 00:38:32.079
people in the valley.
 

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:34.876
So sure enough the French
attack, there is a big rain

00:38:34.876 --> 00:38:36.824
storm,
the French are shooting down

00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:39.632
from the heights,
and Washington and his little

00:38:39.632 --> 00:38:42.070
troop are down in this sort of
soggy,

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.181
increasingly puddled fort in
which their powder is all

00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:48.880
getting soaked in these huge
puddles as it continues to rain.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.838
This did not end well for
Washington and basically he

00:38:50.838 --> 00:38:51.969
ultimately had to surrender.
 

00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:54.610
Not only did he have to
surrender,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.280
but because of a document that
was really badly translated,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.494
he signed his name to terms of
surrender which announced that

00:39:01.494 --> 00:39:04.663
Washington had,
quote, "assassinated"

00:39:04.663 --> 00:39:05.829
a French diplomat.
 

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:09.289
Yes, I assassinated a--This was
all bad.

00:39:09.289 --> 00:39:11.097
[laughter]
This is just--This is George

00:39:11.097 --> 00:39:12.001
Washington's entry.
 

00:39:12.001 --> 00:39:12.429
Right?
 

00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:13.860
Let's give the command to him.
 

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.590
This is not a good moment for
George.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.164
And in addition to that,
supposedly in this moment,

00:39:18.164 --> 00:39:20.380
Washington wrote a letter to
his brother.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.797
He was still kind of cheery
about this whole thing,

00:39:22.797 --> 00:39:24.250
throughout this whole thing.
 

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.179
He wrote a letter to his
brother and he said--

00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:29.306
I have to quote it precisely
here--"I heard bullets

00:39:29.306 --> 00:39:31.648
whistle and,
believe me, there was something

00:39:31.648 --> 00:39:32.994
charming in the sound."
 

00:39:32.994 --> 00:39:33.380
Right?
 

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.510
He's so excited about getting a
chance to fight.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.570
It's like--the charming sound
of bullets.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.469
Supposedly, that quote made its
way back to King George the

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:42.465
Second,
who thought it was a really

00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:45.070
stupidly ridiculous thing for
anybody to say,

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.829
and I think what the king said
was something along the lines

00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:50.775
of: 'He wouldn't think so if he
heard very many of those bullets

00:39:50.775 --> 00:39:51.429
whistling.
 

00:39:51.429 --> 00:39:53.409
They would not be charming
anymore.'

00:39:53.409 --> 00:39:56.000
So, not a good moment for
George.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.628
He's not helping matters,
but in addition to that the

00:39:58.628 --> 00:40:01.561
British really were worried that
Indian relations generally

00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:04.342
speaking were deteriorating
largely due to complications

00:40:04.342 --> 00:40:07.579
between colonies that weren't
cooperating with each other.

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:10.916
So the governors of
Massachusetts and New York

00:40:10.916 --> 00:40:13.809
persuade the British Lords of
Trade--

00:40:13.809 --> 00:40:16.500
they're the guys who regulate
trade in the colonies--

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.440
to issue a call for a
conference to meet in Albany in

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.230
June of 1754 to negotiate with
the Six Nations,

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.507
with the Iroquois
Confederation,

00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:30.844
and to talk about other ways of
coordinating defense for the

00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:31.800
colonies.
 

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.831
So in 1754, there is this
meeting called to figure out a

00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:38.250
way for the colonies to jointly
work things out with the Native

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.960
Americans, the Six Nations.
 

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.559
Invitations went to nine
colonies: Massachusetts,

00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:47.750
New Hampshire,
New York, New Jersey,

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.576
Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia,

00:40:50.576 --> 00:40:53.900
Rhode Island,
and Connecticut.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.630
I'll repeat that one more time:
Massachusetts,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.974
New Hampshire,
New York, New Jersey,

00:40:56.974 --> 00:40:58.204
Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia,

00:40:58.204 --> 00:40:59.590
Rhode Island,
and Connecticut.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.900
North Carolina,
South Carolina,

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.523
and Georgia were not included
because they were probably just

00:41:03.523 --> 00:41:06.103
too far away from where people
thought there was going to be

00:41:06.103 --> 00:41:06.760
conflict.
 

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.782
New Jersey and Virginia
declined because it was too

00:41:09.782 --> 00:41:10.869
expensive to go.
 

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:13.356
So even here when you--people
are afraid, there's an Indian

00:41:13.356 --> 00:41:15.800
threat--some colonies just say,
'Oh, it costs too much.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.820
I don't think I'm going to
bother.'

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.335
But this meeting--I'll end here
and I'll pick up with this

00:41:20.335 --> 00:41:21.750
little end passage on Tuesday.
 

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.195
This meeting came to be known
as the Albany Congress--the

00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:28.260
Albany Congress in 1754.
 

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.815
And I'll talk briefly on
Tuesday about the Albany

00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:33.159
Congress and what it was and
what it did,

00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:36.088
and then I'll segue from
that,--which also doesn't end

00:41:36.088 --> 00:41:38.650
well--
in to the Stamp Act.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:44.000

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.394
Prof: Now today we're
going to be talking about

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.398
musical Impressionism--next time
modernism, but today musical

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:08.300
impressionism.
 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.967
Impressionism,
generally speaking,

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:16.140
is a period in the history of
music running from 1880 to 1920.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.671
It's mostly a French phenomenon
although it did expand,

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:22.613
as we will see,
to England and to Italy and to

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:25.360
the United States even to some
degree.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.806
We have the American
Impressionist School of Art,

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:28.520
for example.
 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.881
Let's turn to the board here
and visit some familiar names

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.010
and faces.
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.901
You know of the painters:
Manet, Monet,

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.868
Renoir, Alfred Sisley,
Camille Pissarro,

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.824
and the American--interesting
enough--American woman,

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:46.270
Mary Cassatt.
 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.736
Any time an art museum needs to
raise cash, what sort of

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:53.010
exhibition do they put on?
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.350
A blockbuster exhibition of
Impressionist painting.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.310
That's what brings everybody in.
 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.296
It is the locus,
somehow, of what art is

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.600
supposed to be.
 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.119
Everybody loves these
Impressionist exhibitions

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.200
whether it's Boston,
New York, Chicago,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.569
wherever it might be.
 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.030
So we have those artists.
 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.161
We also have the poets--though
interestingly enough they're not

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:15.030
called so much Impressionist
poets.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.110
They're called the Symbolist
poets,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.247
and I'm sure in literature
classes and in French classes

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.269
you have studied some of them:
Charles Baudelaire,

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:25.783
Paul Verlaine,
Arthur Rimbaud,

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.470
and Stephane Mallarmé.
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.950
Turning now to the composers,
the most important of these,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.660
really, is Claude Debussy.
 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.846
He sort of started this school
of French composition,

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:39.940
the Impressionist style.
 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.910
We list others up
there--Maurice Ravel.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.560
We've bumped into Bolero
of Ravel;

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.643
Gabriel Fauré
wrote some beautiful

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:50.790
Impressionist music.
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.147
You may have heard of parts of
the Fauré

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:55.200
"Requiem"
from time to time;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.870
Ottorino Respighi,
an Italian, suggesting that

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.141
this also got to Italy;
and the American,

00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:05.329
Charles Griffes,
who died of the influenza in

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.025
New York City but wrote some
Impressionist piano and

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.620
orchestral music.
 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.169
In terms of the works of these
individuals,

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:20.400
we've listed more over here for
Debussy than any one else--

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.745
Clair de Lune,
that we're going to be talking

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:25.688
about today,
that's important,

00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:28.229
Prelude to the Afternoon of
a Faun.--

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.497
we'll be hearing some of that
and you have your Listening

00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:37.068
Exercise 40 on Prelude to the
Afternoon of a Faun,

00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:40.710
other orchestral pieces,
Nocturnes--

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.410
sort of night mood pieces,
La Mer,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.710
a big orchestral composition,
Images,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.530
more orchestral works,
and then preludes for piano.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.202
And we'll be foregrounding
those preludes for piano here

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:59.941
today and a couple of pieces
that we listed on the board:

00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:03.346
the "Ondine"
from Gaspar de la Nuit

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:07.419
that will be performed for us
later in the hour today,

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.870
and the Bolero that we
have mentioned before.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.098
So those are the players.
 

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:16.699
Let's take a look now at what
this music sounds like.

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:21.784
I'm going to start with playing
some of this piece that you all

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:22.360
know.
 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:49.520
I'm sure you've heard this
before: Clair de Lune

00:03:49.520 --> 00:04:07.628
(1890) &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:04:07.628 --> 00:04:10.479
And we'll pick it up from there
in just a moment.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.378
But obviously-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:14.729
we've talked a little about
this before--this general

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.396
relaxation caused by the falling
down motive only to rise up

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:18.889
&gt;
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:19.810
at this point.
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.384
But also of interest here is
the absence of any kind of

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:25.910
clear-cut meter.
 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.850
That's, I think,
the big-ticket item here.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.382
You'd be hard pressed to tap
your foot to this,

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:31.980
to conduct this in any way.
 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.880
So that takes us through,
oh, the first twelve,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.709
fifteen bars of this piece.
 

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.339
Now a different kind of music.
 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:51.379
&gt;
 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:52.940
Let's pause on this for a
moment.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.331
I'll be emphasizing the
phenomenon of parallel motion

00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:00.050
today--parallelism today--and
here is a moment of that.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.701
&gt;
 

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.470
, all the voices.
 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.158
They probably have six
different notes &lt;&lt;plays

00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:07.949
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.851
in that chord,
but the next one &lt;&lt;plays

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:11.838
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:14.442
all six are going in the same
direction rather than

00:05:14.442 --> 00:05:16.629
having--going in the opposite
direction.

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.629
We'll continue to elaborate on
that as we proceed.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:43.180
&gt;
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.978
Okay.
 

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:53.560
Now another idea comes in here,
&gt;

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.699
lovely, really nice,
&gt;

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.660
could be Chopin,
right, that kind of rich sound

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.278
with the &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:02.733
almost guitar-like
accompaniment underneath it,

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:04.920
but something really neat
happens here.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.259
&gt;
 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.819
We have this chord
&gt;

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.889
and then we have this chord
&gt;

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.709
--kind of a surprising or
shocking, unexpected chord.

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.785
So that's something else we get
here with this impressionist

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.480
style: unexpected chords,
new chords.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.528
We might have normally
&gt;.

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:41.440
Then we could go &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.564
and that kind of Beethoven-type
sound, but here we get

00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:47.666
&gt;
 

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:51.322
, going to, not chords a fourth
or a fifth away,

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:53.970
but chords just a third away.
 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:02.120
&gt;
 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.699
Okay.
 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:32.170
&gt;
 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.360
Now that's another interesting
moment.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.952
We've had--we've got this sound
here to begin with &lt;&lt;plays

00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:40.120
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.290
Well, that's kind of--
&gt;

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.959
And then the next chord is
&gt;.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.160
We haven't had those chords
before.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.110
We've had major triads,
we've had minor triads,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.031
we've had diminished triads and
now we've got the kind of flip

00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:01.110
side of the diminished triad--
the augmented triad.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.860
This is the fourth of our
triads.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.050
Major &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.500
--we've got a major third on
the bottom and minor third on

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:07.759
top.
 

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.745
Minor, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:10.269
changes those around,
&gt;

00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:12.793
a minor third on the bottom,
major on top,

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:14.824
major, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:08:14.824 --> 00:08:15.439
minor.
 

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:17.673
Then we could have--we have got
this sharp, biting chord called

00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:18.720
&gt;
 

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.180
the diminished if we just two
minor thirds.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.610
It's the most narrow of the
triads, &lt;&lt;plays

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.370
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.560
but supposing we had two major
thirds in this aggregate,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.769
&gt;
 

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:33.440
yeah, that kind of sound.
 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.070
Well, it's a little bit weird
&gt;

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.004
so we get once again a new
chord here with the

00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:39.067
Impressionist--the augmented
triad, &lt;&lt;plays

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:39.798
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:44.759
--and we might kind of pile
them up &lt;&lt;plays

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:46.309
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:47.620
in this fashion.
 

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.149
&gt;
 

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:51.690
It's a different sound,
kind of a strange sound.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.395
All right.
 

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:56.496
Well, that's a little bit of
Clair de Lune of Claude

00:08:56.496 --> 00:09:00.808
Debussy and that introduces us
to the Impressionist style.

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:02.590
We're going to move on now to
first--

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.566
the first orchestral piece of
Debussy and that's the

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:11.322
Prelude to the Afternoon of a
Faun that's listed on the

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:12.570
board there.
 

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.422
In 1894, Debussy lamented that
he had never created a

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:17.460
masterpiece.
 

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.460
Well, he sort of did with this
piece.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.490
It's really a wonderful,
wonderful composition.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.143
It goes about ten minutes and
you've got the full composition

00:09:26.143 --> 00:09:27.693
there on your CD No.
 

00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:28.159
5..
 

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:31.490
What can we say about it?
 

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.255
Well, first of all,
Prelude to the Afternoon of

00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:37.022
a Faun: its point of
inspiration was a poem by

00:09:37.022 --> 00:09:38.658
Stephane Mallarmé.
 

00:09:38.658 --> 00:09:41.811
Mallarmé
was an aesthetic mentor of

00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:42.580
Debussy.
 

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.759
They were close friends.
 

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:48.187
Once a week they would meet and
talk about aesthetic issues in

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:51.308
Paris in the Boulevard
Montparnasse area.

00:09:51.308 --> 00:09:56.097
So he--Mallarmé--had
written a poem called "The

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:58.408
Afternoon of a Faun."
 

00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:01.817
Now this faun here is not
f-a-w-n, the little baby

00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:03.942
deer-type fawn,
but f-a-u-n,

00:10:03.942 --> 00:10:07.773
a sort of randy satyr,
half man, half beast,

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:13.527
who spends his afternoon in
pursuit of sexual gratification

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:19.230
in the heat of the midday sun--
so it's a bit more sexually

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.509
supercharged than the story of
Bambi.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:28.634
Let's go on and think about the
type of music that we're about

00:10:28.634 --> 00:10:30.139
to hear here.
 

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:34.678
It's a different kind of music,
and maybe the best thing to do

00:10:34.678 --> 00:10:36.389
is just jump into it.
 

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:41.662
For us, it's difficult to
appreciate how strange this must

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:43.048
have sounded.
 

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:44.330
We're kind of used to this
sound.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.485
We've gotten--and maybe you've
heard &lt;&lt;plays

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:45.840
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.609
augmented triads and there are
a lot of &lt;&lt;plays

00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:48.120
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.532
major seventh chords in
Debussy, sounds a bit like a

00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:52.565
jazz chord, yeah,
because jazz &lt;&lt;plays

00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:53.370
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.158
performers like that sound.
 

00:10:55.158 --> 00:11:00.827
They heard it in the
Impressionists and they drew it

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.940
into their music.
 

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.167
So there are strange chords
here, but there's also strange

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:08.701
orchestration,
and once again we should

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:12.698
remember how unusual this must
have sounded at the time it was

00:11:12.698 --> 00:11:13.418
created.
 

00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:16.495
So let's listen to a little bit
of the Prelude to the

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:19.458
Afternoon of a Faun,
picking it up about-- it's in

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:20.408
ternary form.
 

00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:22.149
We're picking it up in returned
A.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.389
See if you can tell me what the
meter is here.

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:55.570
&gt;
 

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:55.879
Okay.
 

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:58.360
Let's just pause it there for a
moment.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.029
Anybody know what the meter is?
 

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:02.250
No. I don't either.
 

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.630
I'd have to look at the score
and I never look at the score

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.370
for this course.
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.408
That seems like cheating.
 

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:08.009
I shouldn't have any more
advantage than you do.

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:10.509
So it's a little hard to know
what it is there.

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:13.155
We--I'd really have to go get
the music and find out what it

00:12:13.155 --> 00:12:13.649
is there.
 

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:17.470
You heard kind of little harp
glissandos in the background.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.726
We'll be talking more about
that--the harp playing away

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:23.803
there, arpeggios periodically,
&gt;

00:12:23.803 --> 00:12:25.253
or &gt;
 

00:12:25.253 --> 00:12:28.208
, just little dabs of color
underneath by way of a

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:30.139
supporting accompaniment.
 

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:32.539
So let's listen to a little bit
more here.

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:34.548
Focus on the flute line.
 

00:12:34.548 --> 00:12:37.467
That's got the melody but it's
a kind of different melody than

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.669
the melodies that we have been
listening to.

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:50.090
&gt;
 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:13:08.580
Passed it to the oboe,
&gt;

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:18.370
, okay, pausing it there.
 

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.649
So that melody,
&gt;

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:28.269
is kind of like a roulade,
kind of ill-formed in a way.

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:32.220
It's very beautiful,
but it's difficult to sing.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.370
It's chromatic,
it doesn't have any regular

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.523
structure to it,
and this is typical of the

00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:41.450
Impressionists' approach to
melody.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.952
Well, as I say,
this was somewhat shocking at

00:13:43.952 --> 00:13:44.580
the time.
 

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.543
This is Debussy's response to a
poem, and you have the poem

00:13:48.543 --> 00:13:49.090
there.
 

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.169
It's given to you on the sheet
for today.

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:52.330
Everybody got the sheet?
 

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.716
We're not going to read it
because we don't have time for

00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:56.019
it.
 

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.980
It's a good example, however.
 

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.450
It's a wonderful example of the
Symbolist poetry,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.687
where the meaning comes not
from any kind of logical

00:14:05.687 --> 00:14:10.488
semantic--
no--syntactical presentation of

00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:13.720
ideas,
one word following the next in

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.952
a logical fashion,
but just sort of placing key

00:14:16.952 --> 00:14:20.460
words at interesting moments
that stimulate our thinking.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.418
These words have resonance in
and of themselves.

00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:27.967
And I think that in some ways
gets to the essence of this

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.946
Symbolist poetry,
so you can take a look at that

00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:32.340
on your own there.
 

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.230
So Debussy was not trying to
write program music here.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.903
He was just trying to use this
as a point of inspiration,

00:14:39.903 --> 00:14:43.904
and here's what he said at the
time about his approach to this

00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:44.558
piece.
 

00:14:44.558 --> 00:14:48.186
Quote: "The piece is
really a sequence of mood

00:14:48.186 --> 00:14:52.538
paintings throughout which the
desires and dreams of the faun

00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:55.730
move in the heat of the
afternoon."

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.105
So Mallarmé
then went to the first concert

00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:03.326
of this piece and here's what he
said in turn about Debussy's

00:15:03.326 --> 00:15:04.028
music.
 

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:07.129
Quote: "I never expected
anything like it.

00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:11.043
The music prolongs the emotion
of my poem and paints its

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:14.532
scenery more passionately than
could colors,"

00:15:14.532 --> 00:15:17.908
--
paints it, so music as painting.

00:15:17.908 --> 00:15:21.440
Well, with this idea of music
as painting--

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.658
because these two artistic
disciplines can't be separated

00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:28.076
really from one another--
let's turn to our first slide

00:15:28.076 --> 00:15:30.649
for today and we'll see how this
works.

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:40.058
What's this? Anybody know this?
 

00:15:40.058 --> 00:15:43.232
Kind of a classic of
Impressionist painting,

00:15:43.232 --> 00:15:45.743
"La
Grenouillère,"

00:15:45.743 --> 00:15:48.399
the frog pond,
painted by Monet.

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.048
I don't know the date,
probably 1874 or 1875,

00:15:53.048 --> 00:15:54.740
I would guess.
 

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.870
And we get this general
impression of it.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.399
If we look, however,
at the brush work of it,

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:03.700
and let's go to that,
a kind of close-up,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.769
 
 

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:11.302
we see--here we are--that it's
really made up of a series of

00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:12.620
individual gestures.
 

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.308
There's a mark there,
a mark there,

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.350
and so on, but when we--let's
go to the next slide--

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.158
stand back we do get this sort
of shimmering impression,

00:16:21.158 --> 00:16:23.289
and there'll be a lot of that,
the same kind of effect,

00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:24.558
worked out in music.
 

00:16:24.558 --> 00:16:28.274
Yes, you can have a chord,
but that chord could be played

00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:30.994
as an arpeggio,
and you could pedal with it and

00:16:30.994 --> 00:16:33.796
you could play it very rapidly
and you wouldn't notice the

00:16:33.796 --> 00:16:34.779
individual notes.
 

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:39.996
You would get the effect of the
impression of this general wash

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:42.484
of sound so that,
in some ways,

00:16:42.484 --> 00:16:46.320
is a similarity here between
these two artistic disciplines .

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.179
Let's go on to the next or
maybe that makes that point.

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:51.259
No. This is fine.
 

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.730
We're going to go on to a
sailboat here now.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.863
And we needn't mention where
this comes from but this is a

00:16:57.863 --> 00:17:03.176
picture of sailboats sort of
luffing more or less listlessly

00:17:03.176 --> 00:17:08.670
at anchor here at a harbor
probably out near Argenteuil,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.430
a few miles to the west of
Paris.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:16.011
And with this as something of a
visual set-up,

00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:20.288
let's turn to the next piece by
Debussy.

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:22.509
It's one that you have on your
CDs.

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:28.357
It's called Voiles or
Sails--from these

00:17:28.357 --> 00:17:31.618
preludes for piano of 1910.
 

00:17:31.618 --> 00:17:34.444
And I'm going to start just by
playing and then we'll talk

00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:36.230
about what it is that I'm
playing.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:18:19.450
&gt;
 

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.069
All of that music up to that
point is made up out of a new

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:27.718
kind of scale,
a scale we haven't talked about

00:18:27.718 --> 00:18:30.150
before but now's the time.
 

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.848
It's called a whole tone scale.
 

00:18:31.848 --> 00:18:34.270
Remember when we have
&gt;

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.288
our octave &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:18:36.288 --> 00:18:40.202
with our--it may take a major
scale in there--our octave

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:44.258
divided into seven different
pitches, five whole steps and

00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:45.608
two half steps.
 

00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:49.405
But supposing we traded in
those two half steps for one

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:50.318
whole step.
 

00:18:50.318 --> 00:18:53.720
So instead of going
&gt;

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.817
C to C in that fashion,
we would be going &lt;&lt;plays

00:18:55.817 --> 00:18:56.400
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:04.470
--now I got to do a whole step
&gt;

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.967
--so that's a whole tone scale,
all whole tones within the

00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:08.519
octave.
 

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:11.693
There are a total of six of
them there--just converting two

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.500
half tones into one whole tone.
 

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.410
So all of this business
&gt;

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.078
and so on, just running up and
down a whole tone scale.

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:25.723
All right.
 

00:19:25.723 --> 00:19:37.887
Then at this point where we
stop, &lt;&lt;plays

00:19:37.887 --> 00:19:42.118
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:45.708
well, underneath there--you're
listening to the whole tone

00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:49.296
scale up above--but underneath
we're getting &lt;&lt;plays

00:19:49.296 --> 00:19:50.115
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.130
, kind of a rocking anchor.
 

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.769
What is this in music,
when you just repeat something

00:19:55.769 --> 00:19:57.309
over and over again?
 

00:19:57.309 --> 00:19:57.720
&gt;
 

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.730
A.J.
 

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.119
Student: Ostinato.
 

00:19:59.119 --> 00:19:59.809
Prof: Ostinato.
 

00:19:59.809 --> 00:20:01.108
Thank you very much.
 

00:20:01.108 --> 00:20:04.420
So we have ostinatos coming
back into music here in the

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.828
Impressionist period.
 

00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:07.470
They were there in Baroque
music.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.056
They kind of went out of
fashion in the Classical period

00:20:10.056 --> 00:20:11.420
and in the romantic period.
 

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.542
Romantic is too expansive for
ostinatos, but they come back in

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:17.769
here in the Impressionist period
and they're really important in

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:19.048
the Modernist period.
 

00:20:19.048 --> 00:20:22.078
So it's a harbinger of things
to come in the Modernist period.

00:20:22.078 --> 00:20:24.222
All right.
 

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:35.798
Now let's go on just a little
bit farther &lt;&lt;plays

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:39.230
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.531
where you can hear the ostinato
up above, and that's a good

00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:44.808
example of &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:20:44.808 --> 00:20:48.827
parallel motion,
all of the chords going up and

00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:51.450
going down at the same time.
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:21:10.920
&gt;
 

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.522
What's that?
 

00:21:11.522 --> 00:21:14.390
Well, it's a classic example
&gt;

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.588
of a glissando. Right?
 

00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:18.400
They use a lot in television
and stuff.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.029
What's behind curtain number
three?

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:21.098
&gt;
 

00:21:21.098 --> 00:21:23.076
"Tell us,
Vanna,"

00:21:23.076 --> 00:21:24.140
or whatever.
 

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.921
So it's simply playing an
arpeggio--an arpeggio that's

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:32.618
very rapid family,
kind of--or fashion.

00:21:32.618 --> 00:21:36.048
* That'd
be another sort of glissando,

00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:39.064
just playing every white note
or every &lt;&lt;plays

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:40.068
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:42.798
black note, okay,
up on the keyboard.

00:21:42.798 --> 00:22:00.140
So we had this glissando
&gt;.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.712
All right.
 

00:22:00.712 --> 00:22:03.869
Now let's talk about the scale
we have here because he's

00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:05.420
actually changed scales.
 

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.759
We did have &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:11.710
whole tone but now we get
&gt;

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.460
a pentatonic scale,
just using five notes.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:25.288
&gt;
 

00:22:25.288 --> 00:22:28.548
We've bumped into the
pentatonic scale before.

00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:31.430
Anybody remember when,
way back early on?

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.230
Roger.
 

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.890
Student:
&gt;

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.786
Prof: I didn't hear
that.

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:36.009
A little bit loud.
 

00:22:36.009 --> 00:22:36.618
Student:
&gt;

00:22:36.618 --> 00:22:39.730
Prof: Yes,
to some extent.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.358
It was in that lecture where we
were talking about blues.

00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:45.105
Blues tends to use more of a
six-note scale,

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:47.150
but it was at that very point.
 

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.859
What kind of music was it?
 

00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:49.618
Emily.
 

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:50.328
Student:
&gt;

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:51.423
Prof: Chinese music.
 

00:22:51.423 --> 00:22:51.990
Good for you.
 

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.190
Chinese music.
 

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.584
We had the Moon Reflected in
the Distant Pool and it was

00:22:56.584 --> 00:22:57.680
played by an erhu.
 

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.180
&gt;
 

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.464
Well, here we have another
five-note scale that involved

00:23:05.464 --> 00:23:08.990
whole steps and minor thirds
&gt;.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.925
The simplest way to think of it
is just the black notes of the

00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:14.430
keyboard, and that's kind of
what he's using here.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.108
&gt;
 

00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:21.819
Now one other interesting thing
going on, and that is the

00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:25.269
combination &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:31.305
of--which is what he's doing
here--of parallel motion and the

00:23:31.305 --> 00:23:35.328
pentatonic scale,
because-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:37.038
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:40.420
Does that conjure up any--Chris
is smiling down here.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.579
Why are you smiling, Chris?
 

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:43.338
What does that remind you of?
 

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:44.109
Student:
&gt;

00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:45.259
Prof: What?
 

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:46.880
Student: The Far East.
 

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.339
Prof: All right.
 

00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:49.368
The Far East. Indeed.
 

00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:52.723
But when I was a kid growing up
if I heard &lt;&lt;plays

00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:53.640
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.483
I would be watching Indians
coming over the horizon in the

00:23:57.483 --> 00:24:01.530
West and the good guys or the
bad guys were chasing--it was a

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.150
sign of the Indians.
 

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.923
What this was--what this became
in terms of film music was a

00:24:07.923 --> 00:24:10.348
kind of racial stereotyping.
 

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:11.669
We had "us"
and "us"

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:13.088
went along &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:15.310
in major and minor scales,
and then we had these other

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.818
people &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:19.539
who generally moved in parallel
motion and used a lot of

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:20.528
pentatonic sounds.
 

00:24:20.528 --> 00:24:25.810
So the people in Hollywood were
painting here ethnically with a

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.430
very blunt brush.
 

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.226
It was "us"
in Hollywood in major and minor

00:24:30.226 --> 00:24:32.968
and functional harmonies and it
was "them"

00:24:32.968 --> 00:24:36.410
who went around in pentatonic
scales and in parallel motion.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.470
It was a very interesting kind
of moment there in the history

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.108
of American musical culture in a
way.

00:24:43.108 --> 00:24:45.509
So in any event,
that's what we have in this

00:24:45.509 --> 00:24:46.568
particular piece.
 

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:49.334
Debussy is using this here,
and I'll come back to this a

00:24:49.334 --> 00:24:51.676
little bit later on,
because Debussy was very much

00:24:51.676 --> 00:24:53.999
influenced--
and we can document where and

00:24:53.999 --> 00:24:56.057
why--
very much influenced by the

00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:57.390
Orient,
by the East.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.770
He was hearing these Eastern
sounds in Paris beginning in

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.160
eighteen eighty-nine.
 

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.118
All right.
 

00:25:04.118 --> 00:25:16.269
Well, then this thing goes back
&gt;

00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:24.674
to a whole scale--a whole tone
scale and then finally--

00:25:24.674 --> 00:25:29.190
&gt;
 

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.597
And he instructs the pianist
there just to leave the foot on

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:35.348
that sustaining pedal there,
that rightmost pedal,

00:25:35.348 --> 00:25:37.259
the sustaining pedal,
&gt;

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:41.119
so we get, again,
this wash of sound.

00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:42.440
Okay?
 

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.430
Now one other point about
pedals, while I've got--

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.348
while I have the--I'm at the
keyboard here--

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:53.461
and that is the following:
We've talked about the

00:25:53.461 --> 00:25:58.358
rightmost pedal &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:25:58.358 --> 00:25:59.670
It gives us &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.009
this kind of wash sound.
 

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.048
What's it called, once again?
 

00:26:03.048 --> 00:26:07.519
What's the rightmost pedal
called on the piano?

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:10.519
Yeah, I hear it over here.
 

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:11.490
Who's got it?
 

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.598
Kristen?
 

00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:15.298
Student:
&gt;

00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:16.269
Prof: Okay.
 

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:17.509
Who said that,
please?

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.039
Student:
&gt;

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:18.680
Prof: Okay. Thank you.
 

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.392
This is the sustaining pedal,
right, and it gives us the wash

00:26:21.392 --> 00:26:21.890
of sound.
 

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.740
What's the leftmost pedal do?
 

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:29.859
&gt;
 

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:31.358
Frederick.
 

00:26:31.358 --> 00:26:33.781
Student: And that's the
one that moves it over

00:26:33.781 --> 00:26:35.038
&gt;
 

00:26:35.038 --> 00:26:36.067
Prof: That's right.
 

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:38.204
Moves the whole keyboard over
so those hammers are only

00:26:38.204 --> 00:26:40.539
striking two strings rather than
striking three strings.

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:41.640
It makes it a little softer.
 

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.104
The middlemost pedal,
however, is a very interesting

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:46.630
one.
 

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.145
It doesn't get used nearly as
much, and I was thinking this

00:26:49.145 --> 00:26:49.578
morning.
 

00:26:49.578 --> 00:26:52.035
I was looking in my office on
my Steinway upright and there is

00:26:52.035 --> 00:26:52.759
no middle pedal.
 

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:55.608
And that's because it doesn't
get used very much.

00:26:55.608 --> 00:26:59.636
But when it does get used,
it's used for sort of special

00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:00.368
effects.
 

00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:04.971
I'm going to show you a good
example in another prelude of

00:27:04.971 --> 00:27:05.778
Debussy.
 

00:27:05.778 --> 00:27:09.117
And this is a bit,
oh, hokey I suppose but it's

00:27:09.117 --> 00:27:12.311
called La Cathédrale
Engloutie,

00:27:12.311 --> 00:27:15.068
the engulfed,
or sunken cathedral.

00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:19.476
And of course Monet painted the
cathedral over and over again,

00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:23.664
all sorts of different views of
this cathedral in different

00:27:23.664 --> 00:27:25.109
kinds of lights.
 

00:27:25.109 --> 00:27:26.329
Which cathedral was it?
 

00:27:26.329 --> 00:27:30.049
Notre Dame de Paris?
 

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:33.200
No.
 

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.038
Any art folks here? Sure.
 

00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:38.996
Jacob, which cathedral is it
that Monet--show the next slide,

00:27:38.996 --> 00:27:39.588
please.
 

00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:45.788
It's an impression of the
Cathedral of Rouen,

00:27:45.788 --> 00:27:49.338
which is about a hundred miles
or so up river--

00:27:49.338 --> 00:27:54.648
no--down river toward the mouth
of the Seine so you go the Seine

00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:58.019
toward Harfleur and you come to
Rouen.

00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:01.778
And he painted this,
and Debussy also constructed a

00:28:01.778 --> 00:28:03.809
musical equivalent of it.
 

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:04.779
It goes this way.
 

00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:20.150
&gt;
 

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.750
Notice all the parallel motion
here.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.470
&gt;
 

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.334
All right.
 

00:28:25.334 --> 00:28:29.048
So then the sun comes up on the
cathedral.

00:28:29.048 --> 00:28:32.181
Let's see if we can get the sun
to come up here a little bit on

00:28:32.181 --> 00:28:32.990
our cathedral.
 

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:35.194
There we go,
a little bit sunnier,

00:28:35.194 --> 00:28:38.936
and we get this kind of music
and we'll get to our middle

00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:39.940
pedal here.
 

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:51.410
&gt;
 

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.040
Well, now Debussy is going to
show you what the bells sound

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.130
like on the cathedral.
 

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.336
But as is the case with most of
these French cathedral bells,

00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:00.740
there is one bell.
 

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.118
It's called the bourdon,
this huge,

00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:06.633
big, low bell,
and he's trying to give us the

00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:11.505
impression of the bourdon
here and he instructs that we

00:29:11.505 --> 00:29:14.298
should use the sostenuto pedal.
 

00:29:14.298 --> 00:29:17.729
This is a bit counterintuitive
because we have the sustaining

00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:20.553
pedal to the right;
now we've got this thing called

00:29:20.553 --> 00:29:23.588
the sostenuto pedal that also
sustains but it sustains in a

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:24.480
different way.
 

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.640
It allows you to hit a note
&gt;

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.680
and hold that note
&gt;

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.580
and then you can play other
stuff and clear that other stuff

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.728
with your sustaining pedal while
that note is still sounding down

00:29:35.728 --> 00:29:36.220
there.
 

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:49.301
And he uses it here to get the
effect of this large bell

00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:56.200
&gt;
 

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:17.009
as the other bells sound above
it &gt;

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:19.460
and then a fade-out at that
point.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.660
&gt;
 

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.568
Okay.
 

00:30:26.568 --> 00:30:32.480
So that takes us to the end of
this particular prelude,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.836
and I have a lot of other
things I'd like to say about

00:30:34.836 --> 00:30:36.788
Impressionist music,
very interesting stuff.

00:30:36.788 --> 00:30:39.410
I think I'm going to cut to the
chase,

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.646
however, with just showing you
a few slides because we have a

00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:45.400
guest that we want to talk with
and she is here,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.288
and we want to move on to that.
 

00:30:47.288 --> 00:30:49.625
In the textbook,
and you can read about this in

00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:52.366
the Impressionist chapter in the
textbook--let's go on,

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:53.838
Jacob, to the next slide.
 

00:30:53.838 --> 00:30:59.490
And the point here is the
association of color.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:12.970
 
 

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.401
So we're going to make a point
here and that is that musicians

00:31:17.401 --> 00:31:20.088
in this Western tradition of
Bach,

00:31:20.088 --> 00:31:24.038
Beethoven, and Mozart and so on
always tie line to color.

00:31:24.038 --> 00:31:28.368
In a section one day,
I think it was Roger--

00:31:28.368 --> 00:31:32.130
where's my Roger--asked
me--there he is back there--

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.828
"How do we know it's a
melody?"

00:31:33.828 --> 00:31:37.755
Well, one reason we know in all
this complex of music that

00:31:37.755 --> 00:31:41.957
something is a melody is that in
orchestrated pieces when it's

00:31:41.957 --> 00:31:46.088
melody time the composer will
bring in a new instrument.

00:31:46.088 --> 00:31:48.682
It's like telling you,
holding up a sign again,

00:31:48.682 --> 00:31:50.769
"Hey, here's the
melody."

00:31:50.769 --> 00:31:52.608
The instruments are quiet.
 

00:31:52.608 --> 00:31:55.617
Then they come in to play the
melody so let's listen to a

00:31:55.617 --> 00:31:58.626
famous passage of Tchaikovsky
here out of "Romeo and

00:31:58.626 --> 00:32:01.690
Juliet" where you work up
nicely in the strings.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.368
When we get to
"melody"

00:32:03.368 --> 00:32:05.383
time,
in comes the flute playing the

00:32:05.383 --> 00:32:08.515
melody and a French horn now
enters to play an accompaniment

00:32:08.515 --> 00:32:09.099
with it.
 

00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:26.170
&gt;
 

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.670
Melody time.
 

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:42.828
&gt;
 

00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:44.945
Now that's one approach,
but Debussy starts doing

00:32:44.945 --> 00:32:46.490
something a little bit
different.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.000
He's going to start working
just with color--a little bit,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.895
if we can get to it,
of an orchestral piece with

00:32:52.895 --> 00:32:55.730
Debussy where he's using a new
instrument.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.160
It's the human voice.
 

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.210
What's the instrument singing
here?

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:31.578
&gt;
 

00:33:31.578 --> 00:33:34.529
Not singing much of anything,
just singing "ah."

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:37.088
It's just--what he wants there
is the warm sound,

00:33:37.088 --> 00:33:40.160
the stable, warm sound of the
human voice,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.890
and--as Thomas Mann said--and
he just brings that in,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.640
a little dab of color there,
a little dab of color there.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.180
What's interesting him is not
line but just color.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.932
He's going to pull in color
away from line,

00:33:52.932 --> 00:33:57.058
and that begins to happen here
in the painting of the period.

00:33:57.058 --> 00:34:02.509
They begin to intensify color
and separate color from line.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:05.567
Here we have Matisse,
nineteen oh-nine,

00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:07.660
"The Dancers."
 

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.059
This is version one of this.
 

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.284
You may not know that he
actually painted this particular

00:34:12.284 --> 00:34:12.840
scene twice.
 

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.047
Version one,
notice just the kind of

00:34:15.047 --> 00:34:17.632
flesh-tone colors;
notice the position of the

00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:17.989
knees.
 

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.561
Now we're going to go to
version two, two years later,

00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:22.909
much more intense.
 

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:27.771
The position of the legs and
the hamstrings here is much more

00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:32.307
angular and we have a much more
visceral response to this

00:34:32.307 --> 00:34:36.440
because of the addition of the
red color to it.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.576
And red becomes a very
important color with the

00:34:39.576 --> 00:34:43.666
painters of this period and they
begin to take this color and

00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:47.280
just play with the color itself
outside of line,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.219
which is what Debussy is doing.
 

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.119
So let's go on to the next
slide here.

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:54.588
Here is Matisse's "Red
Studio,"

00:34:54.588 --> 00:34:57.889
for example,
where the color red begins to

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:01.818
overrun everything or in musical
terms let's go to Duffy's

00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:05.126
"Red Violin"
here where the red varnish

00:35:05.126 --> 00:35:08.159
quality of the violin is
spilling out--

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:12.650
outside of the line or normal
confines of the instrument.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.965
So that's an interesting point,
I think--to watch these two

00:35:15.965 --> 00:35:19.340
arts work in tandem at this
particular moment in history.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.976
All right.
 

00:35:19.976 --> 00:35:22.902
I'm going to stop here and
introduce our guest,

00:35:22.902 --> 00:35:23.730
Naomi Woo.
 

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.860
Naomi, come on up.
 

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.010
I've never met Naomi, right.
 

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.539
But it's nice to see you.
 

00:35:30.539 --> 00:35:32.050
Thank you for joining us today.
 

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:43.918
So you're a pianist here at
Yale, and we'll--So here's Naomi

00:35:43.918 --> 00:35:52.969
and we're going to turn the
lights back on.

00:35:52.969 --> 00:35:56.097
So tell us about yourself nice
and loud if you would,

00:35:56.097 --> 00:35:56.639
please.
 

00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:57.969
Are you a music major?
 

00:35:57.969 --> 00:35:59.612
Naomi Woo:
I'm not sure yet.

00:35:59.612 --> 00:36:01.309
I'm a freshman--
Prof: You're a freshman.

00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:02.269
Naomi Woo: Yes, I am.
 

00:36:02.269 --> 00:36:09.070
&gt;
 

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.485
Prof: Interesting.
 

00:36:10.485 --> 00:36:12.637
So why didn't you go to
Juilliard then,

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:13.429
or Eastman?
 

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:16.402
Naomi Woo:
I actually decided to come

00:36:16.402 --> 00:36:19.653
here 'cause I wanted to do a
liberal arts degree

00:36:19.653 --> 00:36:21.659
&gt;
 

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:25.952
Juilliard and then realized
that I didn't want to be sort of

00:36:25.952 --> 00:36:30.320
at a vocational school like that
&gt;

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.166
Prof: That's a smart
move.

00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:33.610
I did it the wrong way.
 

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.416
I went to--and it was a
wrenching experience to go to

00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:41.443
the Eastman School of Music
first and then go to Harvard

00:36:41.443 --> 00:36:45.250
after that because you really
felt like a dummy.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.780
At least I did and rightfully
so.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.889
So you're doing it the correct
way.

00:36:49.889 --> 00:36:52.014
I think generally,
whatever your trajectory is in

00:36:52.014 --> 00:36:53.739
terms of your particular
profession,

00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:58.056
get your broad liberal arts
background first and then focus

00:36:58.056 --> 00:37:02.672
more and more intensely on your
specialty and then subspecialty

00:37:02.672 --> 00:37:04.309
and on it will go.
 

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:07.300
So here you are taking piano
lessons.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.469
With whom do you study?
 

00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:12.980
Naomi Woo:
With Wei-Yi Yang

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.121
Prof: So he is a faculty
member of the School of Music

00:37:16.121 --> 00:37:19.317
across the street and our most
talented undergraduates go over

00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:22.460
there to get their lessons and
they do their practicing.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.768
How many hours a day do you get
to practice?

00:37:25.768 --> 00:37:28.170
Naomi Woo:
I try to practice two hours

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.389
a day but I usually can't do
that more than a couple times a

00:37:31.389 --> 00:37:31.880
week.
 

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.097
Prof: Okay.
 

00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:33.842
Well--yeah.
 

00:37:33.842 --> 00:37:34.789
That's hard.
 

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:36.199
That was the thing that was so
weird about these

00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:36.710
conservatories.
 

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.811
They go down in these practice
rooms and six hours later they

00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:40.380
come out.
 

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.369
They spend their entire time in
there.

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:44.264
It was like learning to be a
great plumber or something like

00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:44.489
that.
 

00:37:44.489 --> 00:37:47.840
It's not a very broadening
experience.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.242
Okay.
 

00:37:48.242 --> 00:37:51.300
So you're practicing two hours
a day.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.260
Does that annoy the people all
around you?

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.753
Naomi Woo:
Well, they're

00:37:55.753 --> 00:37:58.000
&gt;
 

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.889
Prof: Okay,
but how--I thought that was

00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:03.460
just for the School of Music
students.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.094
Naomi Woo:
They--for the

00:38:05.094 --> 00:38:07.929
undergraduates who are taking
lessons at the school--

00:38:07.929 --> 00:38:09.510
&gt;
 

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.442
Prof: I see.
 

00:38:10.442 --> 00:38:12.159
So you're kind of a special
group.

00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:15.527
If Daniel decides he wants to
practice over there,

00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:19.719
they're not going to let Daniel
have a key to the treasury.

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:22.789
Okay, but we are right across
the street.

00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:24.309
What are we building over there?
 

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:26.815
A new music department building
so we're going to have a lot

00:38:26.815 --> 00:38:29.492
more practice facilities in the
basement of that principally for

00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:30.300
undergraduates.
 

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.123
All right.
 

00:38:31.123 --> 00:38:35.000
So this is something that
always interests me.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.980
We have a little time to talk
about it.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.226
How good is your--these kids
that are good at this music

00:38:39.226 --> 00:38:41.469
business, they're good for a
reason.

00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:45.503
It's because they have some
talent and oftentimes this is

00:38:45.503 --> 00:38:47.449
aurally perceived talent.
 

00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:49.699
So how good an ear do you have?
 

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:51.300
I'm not going to quiz you on
this.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.719
I like to quiz people on this
but tell me about this.

00:38:53.719 --> 00:38:54.628
Naomi Woo:
No.

00:38:54.628 --> 00:38:57.358
I have a really good ear and I
don't know how much of that is

00:38:57.358 --> 00:38:59.998
innate or whether it's because
I've been listening to music

00:38:59.998 --> 00:39:01.090
since I was a kid.
 

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:01.840
My parents were always playing
music--

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.190
Prof: Were they
musicians?

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.284
Naomi Woo:
They're not musicians at

00:39:04.284 --> 00:39:04.391
all.
 

00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:05.440
They--
Prof: What do they do?

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.010
Naomi Woo:
My mother's a doctor and my

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.760
dad's an economist.
 

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.954
Prof: Okay.
 

00:39:08.954 --> 00:39:12.809
So they're into quantitative
reasoning in some kind of way,

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:15.400
and this is not incidental,
folks--

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.809
Naomi Woo:
And I'm actually

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:18.219
considering being a math major.
 

00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:19.166
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:20.429
I knew that was coming.
 

00:39:20.429 --> 00:39:22.920
So you may not have absolute
pitch.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.737
You probably don't have
absolute pitch.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:25.119
Right?
 

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:26.733
Naomi Woo: No. I--
Prof: Yeah,

00:39:26.733 --> 00:39:28.710
but you probably have a very
good sense of relative pitch.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.153
What would have happened if you
started out--well,

00:39:31.153 --> 00:39:32.849
was piano your first
instrument?

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:33.768
Naomi Woo: It was piano.
 

00:39:33.768 --> 00:39:34.675
Prof: It was.
 

00:39:34.675 --> 00:39:37.344
Supposing you had started out
on--and what--how old were you

00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:38.250
when you started?
 

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:38.889
Naomi Woo: I was five.
 

00:39:38.889 --> 00:39:39.731
Prof: Five.
 

00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:39.965
Okay.
 

00:39:39.965 --> 00:39:41.228
So you were a late starter.
 

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:41.510
No.
 

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.690
&gt;
 

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.581
Sometimes--Kensho,
who was in here--what did he

00:39:45.581 --> 00:39:46.090
say?
 

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.119
He was three when he started
with the violin.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.329
Had you started with the
violin, do you think you would

00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:51.230
have absolute pitch?
 

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.141
Naomi Woo:
Definitely,

00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:52.889
I think I would have.
 

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:54.079
I do play violin.
 

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:56.844
I play in the YSO and--
Prof: Wait a minute.

00:39:56.844 --> 00:39:58.009
You play &gt;
 

00:39:58.009 --> 00:39:58.460
violin also.
 

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.400
&gt;
 

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.230
Really?
 

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.231
Naomi Woo: Yeah--
Prof: You play in the

00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:02.461
YSO.
 

00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:05.110
That's really hard to get in
the YSO, folks.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.340
That's very competitive.
 

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:07.619
Oh.
 

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:08.268
Okay.
 

00:40:08.268 --> 00:40:09.789
So how old were you when you
took up violin?

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:11.751
Naomi Woo:
I started violin when I was

00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:14.559
ten and I--my sense of pitch
didn't develop for the violin--

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:15.485
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:18.521
So what did you learn from that
and what do we conclude from

00:40:18.521 --> 00:40:19.500
that experience?
 

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.135
If you wanted to develop
absolute pitch,

00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:23.485
what would have been the
sequence in which you would have

00:40:23.485 --> 00:40:25.079
been exposed to these
instruments?

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:25.889
Naomi Woo:
The violin first.

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:29.117
Prof: The violin first
because it forces you to think

00:40:29.117 --> 00:40:32.523
about pitch constantly,
like the Eastern languages

00:40:32.523 --> 00:40:35.730
are--so many of them are tonal
languages.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.369
You have to think about this
issue of pitch early on and

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:42.851
statistically you--
somebody did a study of

00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:48.583
violinists of Asian nationality
or descent at the Eastman School

00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:53.768
of Music and something like
sixty-four percent of them had

00:40:53.768 --> 00:40:56.981
absolute pitch,
and it's a combination,

00:40:56.981 --> 00:41:00.208
I think, of working with a
stringed instrument and working

00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:03.219
with a tonal language,
in many cases.

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:06.152
So it's a very interesting
phenomenon and it sure is very

00:41:06.152 --> 00:41:09.032
helpful when you go to play
these instruments 'cause you

00:41:09.032 --> 00:41:11.199
don't have--
if you can stream the music,

00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:14.099
you're not going to have memory
lapses and things like that.

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:17.353
So now we have a piece and
we're going to have you play

00:41:17.353 --> 00:41:20.730
this piece, "Ondine,"
from beginning to end.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.230
It's based on another poem.
 

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.318
We've given you the poem for
today but it's not really

00:41:25.318 --> 00:41:27.010
relevant--or that relevant.
 

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.480
What's this poem about, Naomi?
 

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.710
Have you ever looked at the
poem?

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.670
Naomi Woo: Yes, I have.
 

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.400
Prof: So what's it do
for us?

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.929
Naomi Woo:
The poem's about a water

00:41:35.929 --> 00:41:39.695
nymph and she's trying to seduce
this mortal man and she sings

00:41:39.695 --> 00:41:43.583
and she asks him to sort of come
in the lake with her and be the

00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:47.228
king of the lake with her,
and he--in the end,

00:41:47.228 --> 00:41:49.599
he says, "No,
I can't.

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:52.590
I love a mortal woman,"
and she pretends to cry a

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.300
little bit and then she just
laughs and says,

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.722
"Well, I didn't love you
anyway,"

00:41:57.722 --> 00:42:00.489
but that's sort of the story
that's going on,

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:04.617
and it's very well reflected--
Prof: Uh huh.

00:42:04.617 --> 00:42:08.032
And so when you play this do
you think of--because we do have

00:42:08.032 --> 00:42:11.789
the text there--do you think of
particular moments in the poem?

00:42:11.789 --> 00:42:12.360
Naomi Woo: Definitely.
 

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.010
Prof: Oh, really.
 

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.512
Naomi Woo: Most of the--
Prof: Do you want to

00:42:15.512 --> 00:42:16.420
play one and--yeah.
 

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.543
Naomi Woo:
Sure.

00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:17.797
Yeah.
 

00:42:17.797 --> 00:42:20.454
Well, with the water that
happens in the whole piece,

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:23.570
just a constant background--
&gt;

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.047
Prof: Interestingly
enough, that chord is an

00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:28.300
augmented triad.
 

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.130
I had-- I cheated.
 

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.750
Are you supposed to
know--recognize an augmented

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.085
triad?
 

00:42:33.085 --> 00:42:33.420
No.
 

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.179
I did go get the score on this
'cause I don't--I didn't know

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:37.630
this piece particularly well.
 

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.539
So--no.
 

00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:42.503
You're not supposed to
recognize a whole tone scale

00:42:42.503 --> 00:42:44.623
from a pentatonic scale,
maybe recognize it's something

00:42:44.623 --> 00:42:46.389
different, but it is interesting
to know.

00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:49.340
It starts right off the bat
with an augmented triad so

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.405
that's the water that--
Naomi Woo:

00:42:51.405 --> 00:42:53.539
That's the water and then
near the end--

00:42:53.539 --> 00:42:56.128
well, and then it sort of gets
really tumultuous when she's

00:42:56.128 --> 00:42:57.780
getting really passionate about
it.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.579
Do you want me to play--
Prof: Yeah,

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:00.338
play a little of that.
 

00:43:00.338 --> 00:43:00.960
That'd be great.
 

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:14.239
&gt;
 

00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:16.210
Naomi Woo:
So that's sort of when

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.344
she's getting really passionate
and really pleading with him to

00:43:19.344 --> 00:43:21.572
come into the water--
Prof: Yeah.

00:43:21.572 --> 00:43:23.500
Does that sound easy or hard to
play?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.119
&gt;
 

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.876
There's a reason she's playing
this and I am not,

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:30.980
yeah, 'cause that's--I took the
easy stuff, big chords,

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.670
not--no.
 

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:35.382
You should look at the score,
and the other interesting thing

00:43:35.382 --> 00:43:38.228
is that the hand--
the chord positionings change

00:43:38.228 --> 00:43:41.280
each time they go up an octave
and that's really hard.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.849
Rather than repetition of an
arpeggio,

00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:47.340
up an octave,
repeat it, same hand position,

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.951
up an octave,
the particular hand positions

00:43:49.951 --> 00:43:52.750
are changing as you go up octave
to octave.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.219
Anything else--I--at the very
beginning of this,

00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:58.684
I did notice--if you could play
the left-hand part just so we

00:43:58.684 --> 00:44:00.369
can hear this melody at the
beginning--

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:07.380
&gt;
 

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:07.639
Okay.
 

00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:10.663
So there we have the outlines
of a pentatonic scale at work

00:44:10.663 --> 00:44:13.789
here, and you're going to hear
that at the beginning and then

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:15.250
you'll hear at the end.
 

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.192
So the general form here,
as if often true with these

00:44:18.192 --> 00:44:21.501
Impressionist composers,
is just ternary form,

00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:26.170
A, B, A with the second and
final A slightly modified.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.239
So we're going to hear this now
from beginning to end,

00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:31.266
Naomi Woo playing
"Ondine"

00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.019
by Ravel.
 

00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:36.550
 
 

00:44:36.550 --> 00:51:38.949
&gt;
 

00:51:38.949 --> 00:51:47.179
 
 

00:51:47.179 --> 00:51:48.360
Wonderful.
 

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.489
Thank you so much.
 

00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:50.070
That was wonderful.
 

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:57.543
So as Ondine flies off,
you will fly off now to your

00:51:57.543 --> 00:51:59.449
next class.
 

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:00.679
Thanks very much.
 

00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:07.000

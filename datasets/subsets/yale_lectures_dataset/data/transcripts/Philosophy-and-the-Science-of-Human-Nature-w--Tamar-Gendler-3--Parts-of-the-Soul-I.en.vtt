00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.770
All right.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.780
So today's lecture is
a lecture about the

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.000
parts of the soul.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.530
And I want to begin with some
passages, two from the ancient

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.880
Greek literary tradition, and
two from contemporary mass

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.360
culture, which bring out the
extent to which it is part of

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.600
the common understanding of
human nature that we are often

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.970
conflicted within ourselves.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.840
So in The Republic, the book
from which we have been

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.600
reading excerpts, Plato's
Socrates tells a story about a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.320
man who is tempted to act
against his better judgment.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.650
And this is the story
of Leontius,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.360
and it goes as follows.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
"Leontius, the son of Aglaion,
was coming up from the Piraeus

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.458
along the outside of the north
wall of the city when he saw

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:04.140
some corpses lying at the
executioner's feet.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.391
He had--

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.910
Socrates using Plato's
terminology of appetite--

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.260
"He had an appetite
to look at them.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.461
But at the same time, he was
disgusted and turned away.

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:21.840
For a time," the story goes on,
"he struggled with himself

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050
and covered his face.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.150
But finally, overpowered by
appetite, he pushed his eyes

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380
wide open and rushed towards the
corpses, saying, 'Look for

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.870
yourselves, you evil wretches!

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.880
Take your fill of the
beautiful sight.'"

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.630
Now, we'll talk more in today's
lecture about the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.180
particular picture that Plato
has in mind when he speaks of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.790
the tripartite soul as involving
this force that he

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.740
calls appetite.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.830
But the basic description that
we have here doesn't rest in

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.960
any way on a particular
Platonic framework.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.250
The idea that one can, on the
one hand, feel compelled to do

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.190
something--

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.330
eat a piece of chocolate cake,
check one's Facebook page--

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.850
those are temptations that one
can try to control, and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.480
struggle with oneself about.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.160
And the narrative that will take
place in the next four or

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.510
five lectures is about what
sorts of strategies are

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.060
available for us, given that
these kinds of conflicts

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.430
inevitably arise?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.930
So that's our first example from
the ancient tradition of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.480
a kind of conflict.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.970
A conflict between a drive of
appetite, on the one hand, and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.300
a drive of a certain kind of
self-regulation on the other.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.290
Second example comes from
Ovid's Metamorphosis.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.180
A long story in which, in the
passage that we're reading, a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.210
character Medea has, against
her better judgment, found

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.410
herself in love with a young
man named Jason.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.630
And here I'm using a
seventeenth century

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.390
translation that's actually
in rhyming couplets.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.600
"Meanwhile Medea, seiz'd with
fierce desire,/ By reason

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.140
strives to quench the raging
fire;/ But strives in vain!

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.670
Some God (she said) withstands,/
and reason's

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.792
baffl'd counsel countermands."

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:52.780
So here's Medea, seized with
desire, trying to control

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.150
herself through reason, telling
herself: it's absurd

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.450
to be in love with this young
man, it's a violation of other

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.930
obligations that she has.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.780
But she strived in vain.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.360
She has the feeling of having
been overtaken by a force

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.720
outside herself, and what reason
is telling her to do is

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720
overridden.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.390
It continues--

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.300
this is a rhyming version of
the passage that's actually

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.880
quoted in prose form in the
Jonathan Haidt that we read

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.800
for today--continues--this
is now in Medea's voice.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.030
"But love, resistless love, my
soul invades/ Discretion this,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.980
affection that persuades./ I see
the right, and I approve

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.240
it too,/ Condemn the wrong--
and yet the wrong pursue."

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.950
So this feeling of seeing what
is right, endorsing what is

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.960
right, condemning what is wrong,
and yet nonetheless

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.850
finding oneself doing what
lies against one's better

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.120
judgment is a fundamental
trope in the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.995
Western literary tradition.

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.400
It's a fundamental trope
in the Eastern

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.100
philosophical tradition.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.710
And it's an extraordinarily
familiar feeling

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.650
in all of our lives.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.240
Third example of the kind of
tension that is picked out by

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.540
this talk of parts of the soul
comes from today's Internet.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.450
Here's a piece about last
year's Sweet Sixteen

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.142
bracketing decision.

00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:37.890
And here's the headline.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.360
"Emotions and analysis conflict
when picking Sweet

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.510
Sixteen winner.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.194
Most of you, says this post,
involved in NCAA pools, had

00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:52.880
difficult decisions last week
trying to decide whether your

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.920
hearts were trying to
lead you astray.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.010
'It's difficult,'" he says,
echoing Medea, echoing Plato,

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.140
to remove emotion during (now in
his own words), "what many

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.640
consider to be the best
post-season in sports." And he

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.960
goes on to describe how
difficult it is to take

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.180
reason's mandate and select a
team to which you don't bear

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.730
emotional connections.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.320
But we don't find this only in
the context of sportsmanship.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.410
Here's a fourth example of the
sort of conflict of the soul

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.390
that Plato is talking about.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.780
This one comes from the greatest
arbiter of mass

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.690
culture, Oprah.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.600
"Listen up," says Oprah, on
Oprah's webpage, "Why Being in

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.330
your Heart is Better Than in
Your Head." So in this regard,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.140
those of you who have done the
reading know that, if we had

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.122
clickers, she is agreeing
with Plato, or Hume?

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:09.950
Is she agreeing with Plato--

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.170
left hands--

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.592
Plato or Hume?

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:16.480
Excellent.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.900
Good.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.270
So Plato's idea is that
reason is in charge.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.080
Hume's suggestion in the passage
that we read, he says,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.920
reason is and ought to be the
slave of the passions.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.900
Now, Hume isn't exactly saying
what Oprah is saying here.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.830
That's something we'll
have a chance to talk

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.570
about more in sections.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.290
But again, we see, just as we
saw in the story of Leontius,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.570
the story of Medea, the story of
choosing your winning team

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.410
in basketball betting, and here
in Oprah, this idea that

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.982
the soul has parts, that there
are conflicts within us.

00:07:57.982 --> 00:08:02.910
So what I want to do in today's
lecture is to talk

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.230
through with you the five
readings which I assigned for

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.280
today, three required, two
supplementary, each of which

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.090
attempts to give voice through
identification of a taxonomy

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.410
to this idea that we are
pulled sometimes in one

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.511
direction and sometimes
in another.

00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:30.200
So the first, which I'll talk
about in detail later in the

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.310
lecture, is Plato's
division between

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.320
reason, spirit, and appetite.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.990
The second is Hume's discussion
of the relation

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.399
between reason and passion.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.260
And Jonathan Haidt, in the book
that we read the first

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.850
chapter of today, presents a
wonderful metaphor there, for

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.790
understanding the relation
between, on the one hand,

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.370
reason--the part of ourselves
to which we have direct,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.830
conscious access, and over
which we have direct

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:13.523
regulative control--and the
other mass of drives and

00:09:13.523 --> 00:09:17.140
instincts which compose us,
which he suggests we can

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.375
understand as an elephant
which we seek to control

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:26.640
through whatever mechanisms
are possible.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.755
Hume's suggestion, in the
passage that we read, is that

00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:37.580
the drive and the impetus
towards motion comes through,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.820
to continue with the metaphor,
the creature whose feet are on

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.520
the ground.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.950
So although it is the case
that there's a kind of

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.220
steering that's possible on
the part of the rider, the

00:09:52.220 --> 00:10:00.200
impetus towards action comes
from those parts of us over

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.420
which we don't have direct
rational control.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.600
And this idea that we are a
bundle of drives that pull us

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.320
in various directions lies at
the heart of the incredibly

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.260
influential, though highly
controversial, picture of the

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.580
human mind that Sigmund Freud
presented in the first half of

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.200
the century.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.910
So Freud's idea is that each of
us, when we are born, are a

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:44.310
bundle of incoherent desires
and needs and passions.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.460
We have a desire to eat, we
have a desire for certain

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.110
kinds of comfort, we
have incredibly

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.450
vivid sexual desires.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.450
And those desires have
no degree of

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.255
consistency about them.

00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:02.960
They pull us in every direction,
and they cause us

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.910
to act in ways that aim
at their satisfaction.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.610
The story of human development,
says Freud, is

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:20.340
the story of going on to
develop two kinds of

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.280
regulative capacities.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.310
The one, which he calls the
ego, is a part of the self

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.820
that is sensitive to reality.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.630
It recognizes that you can't
simultaneously want to kill

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.470
your brother and marry your
brother, because if your

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.610
brother is dead, you
can't marry him.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.050
It may recognize, in fact, that
you want neither to kill

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.600
your brother nor marry your
brother, though that bit of

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.870
information may come from
the third part.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.900
So we have this bundle of
passions that pull us in

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.910
various directions.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.760
And on top of that, as we
develop, comes a part of

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.020
ourselves which is sensitive
to reality.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:18.670
And as that happens, we become
conscious of our experience.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.490
So whereas these desires pull us
in various ways without our

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.520
even being aware of it, the
ego, the sense of self, is

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.509
something to which we have
reflective access.

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:40.920
As we go on to interact with
others in the world, we get

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.520
information about appropriate
ways in which to regulate

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.460
ourselves so as to conform with
the norms of society.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.450
And as we internalize those,
and take them to be part of

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:02.510
what we ourselves endorse, they
become what Freud calls

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:08.430
the superego, sometimes thought
of as the conscience.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.220
So the picture here is that
there are all sorts of

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.980
unconscious parts of ourselves,
some of which are

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:22.760
drives that pull us to do things
like eat and procreate,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.990
some of which are aspects more
sensitive to the constraints

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:33.824
of reality, some of which are
the norms of society.

00:13:33.824 --> 00:13:38.950
And then on top of that, in
a rather smaller part of

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:45.600
ourselves, is an aspect of
which we are conscious.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.750
Now, there are details of the
Freudian picture which have

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.860
been discredited for all
sorts of reasons.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:02.080
But the basic idea that we
have unconscious pulls in

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.600
directions which we disavow has
become, I think, part of

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.910
how it is that Western culture
self-conceives.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.950
I think it's almost impossible
to underestimate the extent to

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.680
which the Freudian picture
underlies twentieth century

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.630
literature, twentieth century
film, and twentieth century

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.890
self-understanding.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.440
Notice that the Freudian
picture, though it has three

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.296
parts, isn't exactly the
Platonic picture.

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:40.645
Appetite and id roughly
correspond, but spirit is not

00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:43.130
the same thing as ego.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:49.320
And reason and superego where
are only roughly correlated.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.310
Those of you who are intrigued
by this discussion can go back

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.010
and look in this week's reading,
and read Freud's own

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.682
presentation of the theories
that I've described.

00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:05.680
The fourth distinction which
I'll go on to discuss in the

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.500
main part of the lecture is a
contemporary extension between

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.330
system one and system two, or
between a sort of automatic

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:21.470
heuristic processing system
and a rational reflective

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.018
processing system.

00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:25.820
And as I said, I'll talk
about that in the

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.030
bulk part of the lecture.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:34.710
I want to just now introduce
our fifth set of divisions.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.380
And these are the four divisions
which Jonathan Haidt

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.020
identifies in the
opening chapter.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.430
So as you know, we read the
Plato, we had the option of

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.451
reading the Hume, the option of
reading the Freud, we read

00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:50.020
the Evans piece and
we read the Haidt.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.580
So Haidt's first distinction
is between what he

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.280
calls mind and body.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.020
And what he points out there is
that so much of our bodily

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:10.570
regulation happens through the
brain, there are independent

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.450
loci of processing.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:21.350
In particular, the gut, our
digestive organ, can run

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.700
relatively independently
of the brain.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.680
And he provides some
examples of that.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.740
But strikingly, one of the
things that he does not

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:38.765
discuss is the famous example of
Mike, the headless rooster,

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:43.620
who was a rooster--here he
is on the cover of Life

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:50.835
magazine--who soon after the
Second World War was beheaded,

00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:54.820
and who went on to live
for another 18

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.070
months, perfectly happily.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.320
Here he is again.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.880
And if you go on YouTube, you
can actually watch a live

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.110
version of Mike the
headless chicken.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.390
Those of you who have pledged to
turn off your Internet, are

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.640
regretting it now.

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:14.880
So the point about Mike the
headless chicken is that

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.076
there's a whole bunch of motor
control representations that

00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:24.557
take place not in the organ
where one would typically

00:17:24.557 --> 00:17:29.280
expect it, in the head, but
rather along the spinal cord

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.604
in various ways.

00:17:31.604 --> 00:17:38.156
The first division to which
Haidt adverts is the fact that

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:43.840
it's actually a biological
feature of us.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.720
That regulation of action
happens through all sorts of

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.625
biological processes, some of
which are located up here, and

00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:59.260
others of which communicate with
the parts of our limbs

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.548
and so on, only through lower
parts of the spinal cord.

00:18:04.548 --> 00:18:09.000
The second division that Haidt
reminds us of the importance

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.390
of is the division between left
brain and right brain.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.560
As many of you know, we have
running along the middle of

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.060
our heads something called the
corpus callosum, which

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.990
connects all the stuff that
happens on the right side of

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.950
our head to all the stuff
that happens on the

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.750
left side of our head.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:40.620
It turns out that in certain
kinds of epileptic patients,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.130
the only way to cure their
epilepsy, their electric

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.060
seizures that run across the
brain, is by severing the

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.886
corpus callosum.

00:18:53.886 --> 00:18:59.898
And by doing so, for medically
necessary purposes, science

00:18:59.898 --> 00:19:04.420
has discovered the degree to
which the processing that goes

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.785
on in the two sides of the
brain is relatively

00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:10.390
independent.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.530
Basically, everything that comes
in through the right

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.150
visual field is processed in the
brain's left hemisphere,

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.410
and everything that comes in
through the left visual field

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.860
is processed in the brain's
right hemisphere.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:33.610
And though many features of
the brain are duplicated

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:40.050
across the hemisphere, others
of them are localized.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.960
In particular, in the brains
of right-handed people,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.590
language is a right
[correction: left]

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.430
hemisphere activity.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.430
And so Haidt describes some
famous research done in the

00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:03.920
1950s by the neuroscientist
Michael Gazzaniga in which a

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.710
patient who had been subject
to a severing of the corpus

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:14.435
callosum, is presented with some
images that either come

00:20:14.435 --> 00:20:17.210
in through the left visual field
and consequently are

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.980
processed on the right side of
the brain, or images that come

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.140
in from the right visual field,
and consequently are

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.650
processed on the left
side of the brain.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:36.770
Interestingly, because
information processed on the

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:41.520
right side of the brain isn't
linguistically available--

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.310
I believe I misspoke earlier.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.830
The language center is on the
left, not in the right brain--

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.180
isn't linguistically available,
when the subject

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:56.240
looks at something that comes
in over here, there's no

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.110
linguistic processing
of what he sees.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.940
But when he's asked to explain
what it is that is in his

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.240
visual field, he engages in
what Gazzaniga called

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.160
confabulation.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.260
So the gentleman here has been
shown with this side of the

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.040
brain a bunch of images
of snow, and

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.820
he is asked to choose--

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.840
remember, this is right brain,
so it's left hand--

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.480
something that goes with them.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.300
And so he selects with his left
hand, controlled by the

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.680
right brain from the left
visual field, a shovel,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.450
something which would
be enormously

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.220
useful if you had snow.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.690
Meanwhile, the left side of his
brain through the right

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.930
eye, controlling the right hand,
sees a chicken claw and

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.040
selects a chicken.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.967
So one side of his brain sees a
chicken claw, and selecting

00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:02.690
the thing that goes with it,
selects the chicken.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.650
The other side of his brain sees
the snow, and selecting

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.080
the thing that goes with
it, selects the shovel.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.490
So far, so good.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.250
I told you the brain is
segregated in these sorts of

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.440
ways, so it isn't surprising
that the right side is

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.570
selecting something that goes
with what it saw on the left

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.990
side, and selecting something
that goes with what it saw.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.750
What happens next?

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:31.530
What happens next is that the
man looks down at the shovel

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.465
and the chicken, which he has
selected, and is confronted

00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:41.600
with the question of why he
has chosen those things.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.425
Now, as far as the language
center of his brain goes, he

00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:50.600
has no idea why he's chosen
the chicken claw.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:50.880
Right?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.130
That information hasn't entered
into the part of his

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.190
brain where the linguistic
processes are taking place.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.390
Nonetheless, what he does
is something called

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.270
confabulation.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.870
He says, Oh.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.195
I take the shovel because
I need to shovel

00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:12.970
out the chicken coop.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.120
He comes up with an explanation
for why it is that

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.020
he has chosen as
he has chosen.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.290
And in cases of hypnosis,
there is a similar

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.080
phenomenology.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.941
Subjects will find themselves
onstage with their arms ad

00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:38.440
legs in a particular way, and
immediately come up with a

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.070
confabulated explanation for it
is why that they are doing

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.030
what they are doing.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:53.600
We are quite typically people
who read our behavior off our

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.291
experience.

00:23:55.291 --> 00:24:01.020
And when we talk about emotion
and self-understanding, we

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.220
will come back to this issue.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.930
The point about left and right
brain is two-fold.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:14.600
The first is that this is a
second example of a biological

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.090
underpinning of the
idea that we are

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.934
divided in certain ways.

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:28.210
And the second is the idea of
confabulation in the sense

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.837
that, to use the rider-elephant
metaphor, it's

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:36.400
as if the rider thinks that it's
his feet that are on the

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.440
ground rather than
the elephant's.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.590
The third division which Haidt
describes to us is the

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.480
division between what he calls
old brain and new brain.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.460
Roughly, the parts of our brain,
the brain stem and

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:01.548
subcortical regions, that we
share with nonhuman animals,

00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:06.730
and the parts of our brain
that are much more highly

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.900
developed in human beings,
namely the cortical region and

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.210
the reticular, the prefrontal
cortex.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:20.450
And Haidt tells there a story
which is useful for

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:26.120
understanding how it is that
self-regulation occurs.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.280
So my guess is that many of you
have seen some version of

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.740
these famous images
of this person.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.970
Anybody know the name
of this person?

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.210
Yeah.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.116
Phineas Gage.

00:25:40.116 --> 00:25:43.870
This is Phineas Gage, who was
a railroad worker in the

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.570
nineteenth century who was
tamping down some dynamite as

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.580
part of his job as a
railroad worker.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.710
And the dynamite exploded, and
this long metal pole went

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.790
through his brain.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:06.520
But, like Mike the headless
chicken, Phineas Gage was a

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.260
survivor, and in fact did not
die, but went to live for many

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.530
more years.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:19.060
In reconstructing the accident,
it's become clear

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:24.770
that the damage which the pole
did was to an area of Gage's

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.780
brain called the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.692
Right up here is the
prefrontal cortex.

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:39.720
And the result of the accident
which happened to Gage was

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.030
like what happened to the
University of Virginia

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.360
schoolteacher that Haidt
describes in his story.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.810
There was a lot of capacity
for a certain kind of

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.120
self-regulation.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:06.040
So in some ways, like Medea,
though Gage was able to see

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.580
what the normatively correct
thing to do was--to see what

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.320
he ought to do, to understand
it, to explain it, to

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.730
articulate it, to say what was
appropriate--he found himself

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.080
unable to act on what it was
that he thought would be a

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.580
better idea.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.580
So he would say something like,
you shouldn't yell and

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.700
scream when you're upset
in a public setting.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.510
He would understand that that
sort of behavior was

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.550
inappropriate.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.960
But he would nonetheless find
himself unable to act on that.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.060
He would end up doing what Freud
would say his id told

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.153
him to do, or what Plato
would say his

00:27:48.153 --> 00:27:51.910
appetite told him to do.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:57.702
Again and again, it's been
discovered in subjects with

00:27:57.702 --> 00:28:01.760
damage to the prefrontal
cortex that they face

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.050
difficulties with
self-regulation.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:13.150
So it looks like at least one of
the places where what Plato

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:20.170
would call reason seats
itself is in this

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.410
particular part of the brain.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.695
And, in fact, there is
reasonably good evidence that

00:28:27.695 --> 00:28:31.450
individuals can suffer, for
example, from attention

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:37.650
hyperactivity deficit disorder,
ADHD, has lower

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:43.200
prefrontal cortex function
than those who do not.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.250
So when Haidt speaks of old
brain--a part of the brain

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:54.570
that we share with beings who
act on instinct, and new

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.840
brain--cortex, and in
particular, the parts of the

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.680
cortex that are especially
well-developed in human

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.500
beings, like PFC--one of the
things that he is talking

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.310
about is this capacity
for self-regulation.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.220
And when we talk about weakness
of the will in

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.670
roughly five classes, we'll talk
about some of the ways in

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.960
which we can exploit the fact
that we have these complex

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:31.020
brains capable of learning
patterns both though our old

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.910
system and through
our new one.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.730
So we are capable of regulation
both in the way

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.260
that dogs and cats are.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.550
If you want to train your cat
not to go on the couch,

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.830
saying, "Please don't go on the
couch, you'll leave fur

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.000
there, and my aunt is allergic,"
is in fact not an

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.400
effective way to train your cat
not to go on the couch.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.030
To train your cat not to go on
the couch you need to do

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.040
something like put a crinkly
piece of paper there that

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.740
makes an ugly noise every
time she sits down.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.030
Or perhaps spray her gently with
a water bottle whenever

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.610
she goes on the couch.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.160
In so doing, you set up
associations between being on

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.910
the couch and a negative
outcome, and change her

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.320
associations with it.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.850
But you don't do it in a way
that engages reflective

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.870
self-regulation.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.020
We as human beings with both old
brain and new can regulate

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:42.030
ourselves in the way that we
regulate and train animals

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.286
through associating certain
activities with positive

00:30:45.286 --> 00:30:48.710
things and other activities
with negative ones.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:55.080
But we can also do so making
use of a kind of reflection

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.610
and self-regulation that
involves a certain kind of

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.880
self-control.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.300
And we'll talk about that
more in later lectures.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.440
So what I want to do now, having
given you first some

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.550
literary texts in which we have
articulated the idea of

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.970
the soul being divided, and then
quickly run through the

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.890
various divisions that we read
about today, is to--

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:20.770
Oh, sorry!

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.580
There's a fourth example
from Jonathan Haidt.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.500
What I want to do, really, is
to tell you about controlled

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.630
and automatic processing,
and then do what I said

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.760
I would just do.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.050
So some of you, at the
conclusion of this class, are

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:39.340
going to walk from this room,
perhaps by taking an elevator,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:45.400
over to a lecture in another
part of WLH that is taught by

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.752
John Bargh.

00:31:46.752 --> 00:31:51.040
And what I want to describe for
you here is a study that

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.860
John Bargh did roughly fifteen
years ago, that brings out the

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:01.055
relation between controlled
and automatic thought.

00:32:01.055 --> 00:32:07.030
So Bargh brought subjects into
his laboratory, and had them

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.246
engage in what's called a
scrambled sentence task.

00:32:10.246 --> 00:32:13.040
The scrambled sentence task is
a task where you're given a

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.710
list of words, say,
five words.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.172
He, beautiful, doorway,
relevant, Thursday.

00:32:20.172 --> 00:32:23.540
And you're asked to put four
of them into a sentence.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.010
In so doing, you're forced
to engage with the

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:26.980
meanings of the words.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.440
The only idea of the scrambled
sentence task is to get you

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.638
thinking about various words.

00:32:33.638 --> 00:32:40.540
So subjects in this study were
presented either with a set of

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:46.266
words that were just a wide
range of words, or with a set

00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:49.520
of words, a portion of which
had terms specifically

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.090
associated with the elderly.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:57.588
Words like wrinkly, and
bingo, and Florida.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.245
Those subjects who unscrambled
the sentences that had words

00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:09.440
associated with the elderly
presumably had primed in their

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.694
minds the idea of old persons.

00:33:14.694 --> 00:33:21.920
And then the dependent variable,
DV, which Bargh

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.150
measured, was how long it took
the people, when they left the

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.444
study, to walk to
the elevator.

00:33:29.444 --> 00:33:33.400
The subject who had engaged in
the typical scrambled sentence

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.330
task walked quite quickly
to the elevator.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.480
But those who had been given
words associated with the

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.240
elderly went very slow.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:56.491
Indeed, subjects who were in
the ordinary condition took

00:33:56.491 --> 00:34:00.520
just over seven seconds to get
to the elevator, whereas

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.400
subjects who had been primed
with words associated with the

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.170
elderly took more than
a second and a half

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.740
longer to get there.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.180
Now, presumably this was not
because they were consciously

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:18.950
thinking, oh, I've got to
get to my bingo game.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:24.110
It was because an image of
something had been evoked in

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.260
their minds unconsciously,
beneath the level of

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:33.040
awareness, and had ended up
affecting their behavior.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.840
And in a series of studies that
Bargh went on to do over

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.850
the next few years, and which
he continues to do now, he

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.020
found this effect over
and over again.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.110
So for example, some subjects
were primed with terms that

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:53.310
had to do with politeness,
others with terms that had to

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.930
do with rudeness, and the
dependent variable, the thing

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:02.880
which he was measuring, was
how likely they were to

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.560
interrupt the experimenter
when they needed to get

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.090
information from the
experimenter.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:13.190
Those primed with words
associated with politeness

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:17.820
waited almost fifteen minutes,
whereas those primed with

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.800
words associated with rudeness
went up right away, and

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.430
interrupted the experimenter.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.570
More recently, in the domain
of embodied cognition, he's

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.950
been looking at things like,
what happens if you hold a

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:40.840
warm or a cold coffee cup before
you evaluate a resume,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.192
and subjects who have, in
the elevator, helped the

00:35:45.192 --> 00:35:48.570
experimenter by ("could you just
hold my mug, please?")

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.390
Holding a warm mug, as opposed
to ("could you just hold my

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:57.590
mug, please") holding a cold
mug, were more likely to

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:00.420
evaluate the resume
positively.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.305
That is, a sense of warmth in
one domain brings with it a

00:36:06.305 --> 00:36:09.370
sense of warmth in the other.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.620
So that's the fourth division.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.610
OK.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:17.035
So what I want to do in the last
ten minutes of lecture is

00:36:17.035 --> 00:36:21.610
to talk about the
two texts that I

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.250
haven't discussed already.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.190
First, Plato's division into
reason, spirit, and appetite,

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.550
and secondly, the material
on dual processing.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.090
Though this next lecture is
explicitly about dual

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.540
processing, if we don't get
all the way through that

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.370
material, I'll begin next
lecture with it.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:47.090
So in the somewhat salacious
material from Plato that I had

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:52.700
you read today--I hope you read
it: It's really great and

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.520
really fun.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.660
So in it, Plato--here's a
wonderful depiction of it by a

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.794
philosopher named John Holbo
who lives in Singapore.

00:37:02.794 --> 00:37:08.028
Plato describes the three
parts of the human soul.

00:37:08.028 --> 00:37:12.480
The first is what he calls
reason, or logos; This is

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.204
represented here by
the chariots here.

00:37:16.204 --> 00:37:19.010
The second, spirit, sometimes
translated

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.980
as honor, or thumos.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.920
And the third, appetite,
or epithumos

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.640
Now Plato presents a number of
metaphors by which we can

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.400
understand this.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.890
In the Republic, in a passage
which we're reading for early

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:44.480
next week, he describes reason
as a human being, spirit as a

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:50.445
lion, and appetite as a
multiheaded beast. And in the

00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:53.720
passage that we read for today,
from the Phaedrus, he

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:59.550
describes reason as "a
charioteer," spirit as "a good

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:06.220
horse, noble in frame,
well-jointed, with a high neck

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.860
and regal bearing.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:15.910
His coat is white and he is
controllable by word alone."

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:21.090
Appetite, by contrast, on the
Platonic picture, is "a great

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.640
crooked jumble of limbs with a
short bull neck, a pug nose,

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.500
dark skin, bloodshot white eyes,
companion to wild boasts

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.420
and indecency, shaggy around
the ears, deaf as a post,

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.090
barely yielding to the horsewhip
and the goad

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.710
combined."

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.190
And Plato goes on to describe
in the passage that we read

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:51.770
today a rather exciting event,
where a man of Athens has

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:57.690
fallen in love with a young
boy, and the brown horse

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:05.120
within him, his appetites, are
ready to engage in those

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:10.300
activities which fell into the
category of things that Freud

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.110
talked about in the id, and I
don't mean that he wanted to

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.170
eat lunch with the young boy.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:24.760
Whereas spirit is attracted,
but recognizes the ways in

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:31.410
which there are social norms,
and the charioteer is involved

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:36.940
in trying to keep
them in line.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:44.870
So Socrates writes of the
process by which the

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:49.910
charioteer tries to bring the
dark horse into line, as the

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:55.480
dark horse basically tries to
get the man to embrace his

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.850
young beloved.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:04.520
So he says: "the promised time
arrives, the horses pretend to

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.768
have forgotten what they were
told by the charioteer.

00:40:08.768 --> 00:40:10.704
It reminds them.

00:40:10.704 --> 00:40:11.850
The horse struggles.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.610
It neighs.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.566
It pulls them forward.

00:40:14.566 --> 00:40:17.550
It forces them to approach the
boy again with the same

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:21.250
proposition, and as soon as they
are near, it drops its

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.610
head, straightens its tail,
bites the bit, and pulls

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.590
towards the boy without
any shame at all."

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:32.160
The charioteer--that is reason,
self-regulation, the

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.750
superego, the prefrontal
cortex--is struck with the

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.160
same feelings as before, where
he feels like this is not

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.040
activity that he wants
to engage in.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.800
"Only worse, and he's falling
back as he would from a

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.670
starting gate.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.765
He violently yanks the bit back
out of the teeth of the

00:40:49.765 --> 00:40:53.850
insolent horse, harder this
time, so that he bloodies its

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:58.110
foul-speaking tongue and jaws,
sets its legs and haunches

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:02.850
firmly on the ground, and
causes it to stop."

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:08.930
Now this idea that one of the
ways in which we learn to

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:15.950
control our passions is by
training ourselves as we would

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:22.620
train a wild animal through
the creation of negative

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.488
associations with certain sorts
of activities is, in

00:41:27.488 --> 00:41:33.010
fact, a fundamental insight
about how human

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:36.540
self-regulation takes place.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:42.171
And with respect to truly
forceful passions, sexual

00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:47.240
appetites in particular, a kind
of self-regulation that

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.942
involves an equally forceful
antidote is crucial.

00:41:53.942 --> 00:42:00.490
Plato's picture is that in the
well-ordered soul, reason, the

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:07.460
charioteer, does the ruling, and
that spirit and appetite

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.310
are, through a process of

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:15.820
self-regulation, tamed and trained.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.870
So what the Republic, the book
from which we've been reading

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:28.420
excerpts, describes, is a
process by which the rational

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:35.960
part of ourselves can come to
be in control of our spirits

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.024
and our appetites.

00:42:39.024 --> 00:42:43.170
Plato actually tells the story
by means of a controlling

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:47.100
metaphor, which is that he
compares the structure of the

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.090
human soul to the structure
of a city.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.360
And he says that just as in
the human soul, there is

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.705
reason, there is spirit, and
there is appetite, so, too, in

00:43:00.705 --> 00:43:06.430
a well-structured city, there
are guardians, those governed

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.650
by reason, auxiliaries, roughly
soldiers, those

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:16.155
governed by honor, and
a kind of worker, who

00:43:16.155 --> 00:43:20.010
is governed by appetite.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.660
And moving back and forth
between the individual and the

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:31.400
society, Plato goes on to
describe a series of processes

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:38.050
through which the will and
desires and impulses of, on

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.940
the one hand, the auxiliaries
and the workers, and, on the

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.885
other hand, spirit and appetite,
can be brought into

00:43:45.885 --> 00:43:49.880
harmony with what
reason dictates.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.440
And it will turn out, we'll find
out in three lectures,

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.840
that this kind of harmony is the
answer that he's going to

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.290
offer to Glaucon's question
about why it is intrinsically

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:12.720
valuable to act in
a moral way.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.900
So that concludes the
presentation of Plato's

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.480
tripartite soul.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.440
What we will do next lecture
is to talk about the

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.760
discussion of dual processing
accounts in the context of the

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.812
two pieces that we're reading
for next class.

00:44:32.812 --> 00:44:37.470
The first, as you may know, or
may have seen, is Daniel

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.590
Kahneman's Nobel Prize
acceptance speech, and you

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.610
have your choice of either
listening to the speech or

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.830
reading a somewhat more detailed
article in which we

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.930
describes its content.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:54.950
And the second is a piece that
I've written on a notion that

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.990
I call alief, which tries to
bring together some of the

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.780
ideas that we have today.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.675
So I hope to see many of
you back on Thursday.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.820
So what I want to do in the
first part of this lecture is

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.030
just finish our discussion of
liberty from last time,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.200
beginning by saying a couple
of additional clarificatory

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.430
things about the particular
pages from Nozick that we

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.830
read, and then moving on to
explaining what I think is an

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.960
important way that Nozick and
Rawls are confronting one of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.050
the problems that each of the
thinkers that we have

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.740
addressed has confronted,
namely, the problem of luck in

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.020
determining human experience.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.050
And when we finish that we'll
move on to the two empirical

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.620
readings that we
did for today.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.580
So you'll recall that in the
pages of Nozick that we read,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.100
Nozick is concerned, first of
all, to present a general

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.455
framework for thinking about
political philosophy in a

00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:09.680
context which prioritizes
liberty and rights.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.610
And, in particular, in the
pages that we read from

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.640
chapter seven, concerned with
articulating a view about the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.200
legitimacy of the ownership of
property that takes as its

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.930
principal justification
only three parts.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.460
The first, you recall, is
Nozick's discussion of the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.930
notion of justice
in acquisition.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.460
And we talked last time about
the conditions under which

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.280
Nozick thinks it's legitimate
for somebody

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370
to come to own property.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.140
And the basic idea there is that
it is legitimate to take

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.210
something from common stock that
is unowned so long as in

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.390
so doing one doesn't
violate what Nozick

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.490
calls the Lockean Proviso.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.870
That is, so long as one leaves
"as much and as good for

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.720
others."

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.080
And we considered two objections
to that view.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.180
One, the idea that there's a
kind of unzipping that occurs

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.080
that makes even the first
acquisition illegitimate if

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.480
the property ultimately
runs out.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.240
And the second based on the
problem of the commons, that

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.670
regardless there's going to be
a time at which somebody

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.840
appears to be disadvantaged by
another taking ownership, and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.650
talked about Nozick's
responses to them.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.500
And it's my hope that in
sections this week you'll have

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.570
a chance to think through
whether those responses are

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.730
legitimate.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.990
We looked next at Nozick's views
on justice in transfer,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.020
which are basically that any
transfer that two people are

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.730
willing to engage in is a
legitimate sort of transfer.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.570
It is an illegitimate
restriction on people's

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.790
freedom, on Nozick's view, to
restrict what it is that you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.060
are permitted to do with
your property.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.950
But Nozick recognizes--

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.740
and we didn't get to this in
our lecture on Tuesday--

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.260
that in addition there's
a need for a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.740
third sort of notion.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.970
And this is the idea that
sometimes property is

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.710
illegitimately acquired, either
initially or as a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.120
result of an illegitimate
transfer.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.250
And that with regard to that,
one is required, on his view,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.030
to engage in some sort
of rectification.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.540
And this idea gives rise to a
rather striking passage at the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.690
very end of the chapter, which
we read for last week.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.940
Nozick writes there that as a
matter of fact there have been

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.510
previously in the acquisition
of property

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.560
incidences of injustice.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.730
This nation, for example, was
founded on black slavery.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.340
And Nozick notes that those from
the least well off group

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.450
in society right now have the
highest probabilities of being

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.902
the descendants of victims of
the most serious injustice.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:33.660
As a consequence, he says,
perhaps the following rule of

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.180
thumb is a reasonable one
for us to make use of.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.850
Perhaps we ought to do what
Rawls suggests and organize

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.570
society to benefit the
least well off.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.020
Past injustices, says Nozick,
may be so great as to make

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.760
necessary in the short run a
more extensive state than the

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.050
one that Nozick has
been advocating in

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.540
order to rectify them.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.650
Page 231, Anarchy, State, and
Utopia, telling us that

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.060
perhaps a good rule of thumb
is to organize society to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.810
benefit the least well off.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.090
So do Nozick and Rawls
agree after all?

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.730
Well notice what Nozick
argued earlier.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.910
Even if we engage in this
temporary act of

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.120
reorganization, liberty
upsets patterns.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.660
So give everybody the same sized
piggy bank, give them

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.890
the freedom to do what they want
with their quarters, and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:55.030
it will inevitably become the
case that some are better off

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.450
than others.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.440
Moreover, as we noted at the end
of our lecture last time,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.760
these distributions of wealth
may end up having

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.660
consequences, where deciding
whether they violate at least

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.750
the spirit of the Lockean
Proviso becomes a rather

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.270
difficult question to answer.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.380
We noted at the end of our
lecture last time that there

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.330
might be a society in which
there's an equal distribution

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.530
of wealth across individuals and
a social interaction among

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.780
them with regard to the
institutions that prepare

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.840
people to become democratic
citizens.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.870
But if, as our last slide
demonstrated, it is inevitable

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.820
that such a structure will
ultimately result in an

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.870
unequal distribution of wealth,
and if an unequal

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.000
distribution of wealth brings
with it the freedom of opting

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.360
out of certain public
institutions, creating private

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.340
ones from which one may draw
away resources that once

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.700
belonged to the public
institutions, then

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.510
particularly in the case of
things like education and

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.150
health, which one might think
are preconditions for

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.160
participation in democracy, it
becomes complicated to think

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.750
through whether those sorts of
distributions are justified.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:41.410
So the Nozick picture presents
us with an idea of what sorts

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.990
of actions are permitted.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.970
It seems for a moment as if
Nozick agrees with Rawls that

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.440
a certain kind of redistribution
is permitted.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.650
But ultimately there isn't the
leverage within the framework,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.200
in at least an obvious
sense, to avoid

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.060
situations like this one.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.590
Now it's an open question
whether one takes it as a

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.460
priority to avoid situations
like this one.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.450
But it is a striking fact of
both A Theory of Justice and

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:24.030
Anarchy, State, and Utopia, that
a look at their indexes

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:32.220
produces no references to
education, no references to

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.550
childhood and only limited
awareness of the topic, which

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.350
will be central to our
discussion today.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.190
Namely the ways in which the
social structures that

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.160
surround us end up affecting
what sorts of preferences we

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.540
have in addition to what sorts
of choices we make.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.790
Now you'll remember that the
fundamental question, which

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:06.660
underlies the debate about
what makes a particular

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.170
structure in society legitimate
is the one

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.870
articulated by Rawls in the
beginning of Theory of

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.990
Justice, which I placed for you
as the second essay topic

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.200
for the final set of essays.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.580
Rawls points out that a society
is "a cooperative

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.650
venture for mutual advantage
typically marked by conflict

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.640
as well as identity of
interests," and notes,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.810
following Hobbes in the social
contract tradition, that

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.590
there's an identity of
interests in special

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.240
cooperation that makes possible
a better life than

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.030
anybody could have without
cooperation.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.930
But a conflict of interests,
since people are not

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.390
indifferent to how those
goods are distributed.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:58.970
Now at some level we can
conceive of one aspect of the

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.480
debate between Rawls and Nozick,
where Rawls says, if

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.800
things come out patterned in a
way that behind the veil of

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.440
ignorance you wouldn't want
them to, intervene and

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.930
redistribute.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:22.186
Whereas Nozick says, if things
come out as the result of free

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:27.280
actions between free
individuals, then regardless

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.490
of what that pattern looks
like, accept it.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:38.000
One can view that difference in
outlook between them as a

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.080
difference in outlook about how
we are morally required to

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.100
deal with the fact that in so
far as things that affect us

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:59.540
occur, determining what is and
is not in our control, in so

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.760
far as it matters for our own
internal reactions to events,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.050
as Epictetus pointed out.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.510
In so far as it matters to our
tendency to respond in keeping

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.540
with our commitments, as
Aristotle and Doris in Doris's

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.620
debate with Aristotle
questioned.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.560
And in so far as it covers our
attribution of praise and

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.780
blame in cases of unintended
wrongdoing or right-doing,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.360
which the discussions of moral
luck and punishment and Kant

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.420
versus Mill on whether there's
moral merit to saving a child.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:43.260
In all of these cases, the
fundamental question that's

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:49.150
being asked is this: what sort
of stance is the appropriate

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.280
stance for human beings to take,
given that as Epictetus

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.210
says, "some things are up to us
and other things are not up

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.180
to us?"

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:08.830
So if we look at Rawls's Theory
of Justice, we read the

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.190
following striking passages.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.910
Rawls says, "The two principles
mentioned," that is

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.800
the first principle which says
rights are untrumpable,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.580
roughly speaking, every
individual is entitled to

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.880
certain basic freedoms,
which no amount

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.820
of utility can override.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.830
And the second principle, which
says, inequalities are

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.580
to be distributed as the result
of offices which are

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.760
equally open to all and in such
a way that inequalities

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.710
are to the benefit of
the least well off.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.240
Rawls says, "The two principles
mentioned seem to

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.390
be a fair agreement on the basis
of which those better

00:12:53.390 --> 00:13:01.010
endowed or more fortunate in
their social position neither

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:07.030
of which we can be said to
deserve, could expect the

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:12.850
willing cooperation of others
when some workable scheme is a

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.930
necessary condition of
the welfare of all."

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:23.130
Or again, "once we decide to
look for a conception of

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.160
justice that nullifies the
accidents of natural endowment

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.250
and the contingencies of
social circumstance as

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.920
counters in quest for political
and economic

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.390
advantage, we are lead
to these principles."

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:49.110
Or again, "these principles
express the result of leaving

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:55.100
aside those aspects of more
social world that seem

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.540
arbitrary from a moral
point of view --

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.170
things we cannot be
said to deserve."

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.580
Accidents of natural endowment.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.070
Contingencies of social
circumstance.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:17.740
Aspects of social world that
seem arbitrary from a moral

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.730
point of view.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:27.260
Rawls is engaged in the ancient
project of thinking

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.590
about how to deal
with moral luck.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:39.620
And because the distribution
of goods and advantages--

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.620
both within the self and
between selves--

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:52.040
is not in many ways up to us,
Rawls concludes that the

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.490
principles that he articulates
in Theory of Justice are what

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.180
justice mandates.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:07.280
Nozick, by contrast, is also
concerned with luck.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:14.510
Let's look at the passages at
the end of chapter seven.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.540
Here, says Nozick, talking about
Rawls's writing, we have

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.840
Rawls' reason for rejecting a
system of natural liberty.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.360
It permits distributive shares
to be improperly influenced by

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.770
factors that are so arbitrary
from a moral point of view.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.930
Nozick says, Rawls is trying
to deal with the problem of

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.570
moral luck.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.700
These factors, he says, quoting
Rawls, are "prior

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.970
distribution of natural talents
and abilities as these

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.900
have been developed over time
by social circumstances and

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:57.550
such chance contingencies as
accident and good fortune."

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:04.510
Notice, says Nozick, that Rawls
is concerned with things

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.390
that are not up to us.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:13.050
But there is, says Nozick, no
mention at all of how persons

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.710
have chosen to develop their
own natural assets.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:24.520
And it's in recognition of the
counterpart oh some things

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.720
being not up to us-- namely
the fact that some

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.610
things are up to us--

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:35.870
that we can see Nozick's notion
of legitimate dessert

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.490
in light of this
eternal debate.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:46.510
This line of argument, says
Nozick in criticism of Rawls,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.510
can succeed in blocking the
introduction of a person's

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.819
autonomous choices and actions
and their results only by

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:59.619
attributing everything
noteworthy about the person to

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:03.210
certain kinds of external
factors.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.220
But, says Nozick, if we start
thinking about people as

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.940
defined by their circumstances
in the way that a logical

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.580
extension of this view would
suggest, but says Nozick,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.680
"Denigrating a person's
autonomy and prime

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.390
responsibility for his actions
is a risky in line for a

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:30.020
theory that otherwise wishes
to buttress the dignity and

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.190
self-respect of autonomous
beings."

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.760
We're back to our fundamental
question.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.410
Given that we are beings
influenced by the world around

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.650
us in ways which it is
extraordinarily difficult to

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:57.530
understand, to what extent do
we deserve credit for that

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.930
which we perceive ourselves
to have done voluntarily?

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:09.000
And to what extent are our
characters and circumstances

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.600
so inextricably linked with
things beyond our control that

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.370
thinking from the perspective of
us as willers of structure

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:27.470
in the world is a mistake
all together?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.580
So I want to point out to you
that what started out as

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:37.360
looking like a debate about
the legitimacy of taxation

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.560
ends up looking like
one of our central

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.420
philosophical debates.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:50.830
Again and again we're confronted
with our status as

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.600
beings in the world that
we both affect and

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.340
are affected by.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:03.220
So that theme in two particular
empirical articles

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:09.190
is what I want to address in the
remaining thirty minutes

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.890
of lecture in the context
of our social structures

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.500
discussion.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.110
So remember that in this
political philosophy unit we

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:24.640
began with a reading of
Hobbes's Leviathan and

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.390
encountered his argument that
because of certain facts about

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.940
human nature-- basically our
desire to control goods around

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.290
us and the limitation
in the number of

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.850
goods that there are--

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.630
we will in a state of
nature be in a war

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.440
of all against all.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.770
And then we looked at a
mathematical representation of

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.160
that in the form of Prisoners'
Dilemma and then considered

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.160
two particular responses in
the 20th century Western

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800
Anglo-American philosophical
tradition--

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.560
namely Rawls and Nozick--

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.280
to think through what a
legitimate society looks like

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.180
in the context of facts
about human nature.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.190
What I want to do in the part
of the lecture devoted to

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:22.250
social structures is to bring
out you the way in which the

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.500
structures that surround us
end up determining our

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.520
attitudes at least as much
as our attitudes end up

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.750
determining the social
structures around us.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:42.620
This is a theme that's present
already in Aristotle.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.380
So in the closing pages of the
Nicomachean Ethics, which we

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.670
read about a month ago,
Aristotle, in a chapter

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.520
entitled, Transition from
Morality to Political

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.510
Philosophy, noted, you'll
recall, that "if arguments

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.300
alone were sufficient by
themselves to make people

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.310
decent the rewards that they
would command would

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:08.750
justifiably have been many and
large." But that "it's not

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.900
easy to alter by argument" what
has long been absorbed as

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.400
a result of one's habits.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.770
How then, asks Aristotle, might
we go about changing

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.310
people if argument alone
is not sufficient

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.380
to make people decent?

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.430
Well, he points out, it's
difficult for somebody to be

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.530
trained correctly from his youth
if he's not brought up

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.810
under correct laws.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.350
For the young do not find
it pleasant to live in a

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:53.880
temperate way." That is why
one of the things on this

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.630
ancient picture of governance,
one of the things the law must

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:05.060
prescribe is their upbringing
and practices.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:11.730
For if they are used to behaving
in certain ways they

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.620
will not find them painful.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:24.830
So Aristotle is talking about
a function of law that will

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:29.470
occupy us both today
and Thursday --

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:35.460
the function of law in shaping
the character of the citizens

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.430
who are governed thereby.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:44.260
But it's not just in Aristotle
that we find this theme.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.960
John Stuart Mill, author of the
famous work On Liberty and

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.040
also author of Utilitarianism,
which we read for this class,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.060
makes much the same point
as Aristotle.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.960
He writes, in talking about
how to structure society

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.270
appropriately, so as to maximize
the amount of utility

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:15.090
that it produces, he says
"utility enjoins that first

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.890
that laws and social
arrangements should place the

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.780
happiness--

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.080
or as speaking practically it
may be called the interest--

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:31.040
of every individual as nearly
as possible in harmony with

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.980
the interests of the whole."

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.860
A well-structured society on
Mill's view manages the

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.700
relation between the individual
and the community.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.890
And utility enjoins in keeping
with that, says Mill, that

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:56.000
"education and opinion, which
have so vast a power over

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.420
human character, should so use
that power as to establish in

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.300
the mind of every individual and
indissoluble association

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.690
between his own happiness and
the good of the whole."

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:21.020
"Education and opinion, which
have so vast a power over

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:28.030
human character." That's the
theme of today's lecture.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:33.010
And in about four slides will
have clickers because it's

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.650
late in the semester and I
want you guys to wake up.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.600
So if you get your clickers out
I'll tell you some facts

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.270
and then you can tell
me some responses.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.550
All right.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:51.480
So the first piece that we
read for today is a long

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.490
survey article from the journal
Behavioral and Brain

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:04.800
Sciences, in which the authors
survey a century's worth of

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.350
anthropological and
psychological research in an

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:16.330
attempt to bring empirical force
to the claim that Mill

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.710
makes here --

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:23.640
that education and opinion,
cultural structures, have a

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.580
vast power over human
character.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.920
The authors argue in this paper
that subjects, whom they

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:39.760
call WEIRD, that is Western,
educated, industrialized,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.740
rich, democratic, citizens --

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:48.440
people who have been brought
into consciousness in a

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.550
society which has these
five features.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:58.980
They argue that these subjects
are atypical, that is, differ

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:05.560
in fundamental ways in their
attitude towards the world if

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.880
you contrast them with subjects
who come from small

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.240
scale non-industrialized
societies, if you contrast

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.010
them with individuals who come
from non-Western industrial

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:23.190
societies, if you contrast them
with individuals who come

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.800
from other Western
industrialized societies, and

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.820
even if you contrast them with
other citizens of their own

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.320
nation who are not university
educated.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:44.050
In particular, claim the
authors, the domains in which

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.860
we can see the weirdness--

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.740
in small letters--

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.790
of the WEIRD-- in large--

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.340
that is the atypicality
of Western, educated,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.620
industrialized, rich,
democratic, citizens include,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.820
they contend, perception,
categorization, memory,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.510
attention, spatial cognition,
self concepts, judgments of

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.510
fairness, tendencies towards
cooperation, tendencies

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.900
towards conformity, moral
judgments and so on.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:20.160
In a vast number of
domains, you--

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:26.370
including those of you who are
not from Western cultures--

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:32.340
differ from the vast majority
of the 6 or 7 billion other

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.080
people on Earth.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.460
And certainly from the vast
majority of those who have

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.130
lived on Earth throughout
time.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:49.360
As a result of the cultural
experiences you have had, your

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.670
perception and apprehension and
patterns of attention have

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.150
been affected.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:04.150
So the authors wrote their
article with a

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.350
particular goal in mind.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.350
They wrote it in an effort to
argue that psychological

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:17.140
research of the sort which fills
journals, including the

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.190
one in which they published this
piece, should be based on

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.900
broader population samples.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.800
And they make this argument
because they're concerned both

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:35.100
with the possibility of
revealing differences among

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:41.210
human beings, ways in which
people raised in one sort of

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:45.441
circumstance differ from people
raised in another.

00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:50.700
And because they are profoundly
concerned with also

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.950
identifying the ways in which
there are commonalities.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.850
And you'll notice as you read
through the article that each

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.550
of the four main sections
begins with a series of

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.680
contrasts between WEIRD folks
and whatever the contrast

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.650
group is, but closes with
a set of identified

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:18.160
commonalities between the two
groups, suggesting at least

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:24.450
prima facie that there are
deep-seeded similarities,

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.772
presumably the result of
evolutionary pressures.

00:29:28.772 --> 00:29:33.010
But this is not a course in
evolutionary psychology.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.160
This isn't even specifically a
course in the methodology of

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.080
psychology.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.910
So why did we read
this article?

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.620
Four reasons that we read it.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.950
The first is that this is a
course, as you know, called

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.890
Philosophy and the Science
of Human Nature.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.500
And this article, perhaps more
densely than any article I can

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.920
think of, contains a vast number
of extraordinarily cool

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.530
facts about ways people
might be.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.530
So the first reason we read the
article is just to learn

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:18.700
some facts about human diversity
and similarity.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.590
In addition, as you know,
this is an "and" course.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.170
This is a course, as you will
recall from the very first

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.490
lecture, that's tries to bring
together different

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.180
perspectives on questions.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.140
And one of the things that
I think this article does

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.800
beautifully, in particular in
conjunction with the second

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.920
article that we read for today,
is to give you a range

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.030
of tools for thinking about
central questions.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.780
One of the things that the
article challenges you to do

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.700
when you observe a behavior and
make a generalization on

00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:01.390
its basis is to ask yourself
how generalizable really is

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.120
that behavior?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.080
But this is also a course, and
this is the third reason we

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.120
read the article, that
introduces you, as you know,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.490
to a dead guy on Tuesday and
CogSci on Thursday, today

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.940
being an honorary Thursday.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.620
So the third thing that the
article does is to make you

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.420
aware of a live critique, one
posed just last year -- the

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.380
article was published less
than 12 months ago --

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.940
to make you aware of a critique
that attaches itself

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.340
to part of the course's
research base.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.420
One of the things that we have
been doing throughout the

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.420
semester, one of the things
that all of you did in

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:53.300
directed exercise five, was to
take a look at some of the

00:31:53.300 --> 00:32:01.640
articles, whose limited
samplings are being challenged

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.420
in this piece.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:10.600
Finally, we're reading this
piece in the context of our

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.410
political philosophy section
in a lecture called social

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.410
structures because it seems to
me crucial, if one wants to

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:24.100
engage in serious political
philosophy, to bring out the

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.990
complex range of considerations
that need to go

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.940
into thinking about how
societies ought to be

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.690
structured.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.730
So what I want to do in the next
part of the lecture is to

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:45.800
run through three examples of
the sorts of cases with which

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.970
the WEIRD article
is concerned.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:54.620
Three cases where a claim is
made that experience has

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.250
affected how it is that you
perceive the world.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:04.120
And I start with their
most dramatic.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.960
Perhaps not the most
well established.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.050
We'll talk about it.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:11.580
But the most dramatic of their
claims. So I'd like you to

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.950
take out your clickers and look
at these things here.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.890
And tell me, to you whether the
two segments appear to be

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.730
such that the top is shorter
than the bottom or it could be

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.720
such that they are of
the same length.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.550
We're talking about just
the line segments here.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.800
Or it could be such
that the bottom is

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.930
shorter than the top.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:44.219
And we'll take 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
4, 3, 2, 1 second to see how

00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:46.330
these numbers come out.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:51.630
So 41% of you think it appears
that the top is shorter than

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:52.550
the bottom.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.600
46% of you, it appears that
they are the same length.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.800
Whereas 14% are such that
the bottom appears

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.340
shorter than the top.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:08.610
14% percent of you, come on
down, you are correct.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:12.120
The bottom is shorter
then the top.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.370
You want to see that again?

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.260
All right.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.609
So what going on here?

00:34:20.609 --> 00:34:23.130
I've got the same animation on
the next slide because I

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:26.909
wasn't sure you could animate
on a slide that had graphs.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:28.449
But it turns out you can.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.850
OK, so again look at these.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.320
These are identical.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.430
These are duplicates.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:35.140
I made them, I measured them
because I have a measurement

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.200
program in PowerPoint.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.580
So this one is actually 3.1 and
this is actually 3 inches

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.260
long in the creation.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.120
So the bottom is shorter
than the top.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:53.360
Now it has been argued that your
tendency to perceive this

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.700
line, when embedded within this
figure, as longer than

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.690
this segment when embedded in
this figure, is the result of

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.610
your having grown up
in an environment

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.400
with carpentered corners.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.910
And the claim is made on the
basis of research done in the

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:23.130
1960s in a vast number of
small-scale non-urbanized

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:28.120
communities, that the
discrepancy between line

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.350
lengths, segment lengths,
required in order to see this

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:38.430
one as being the same length
as this one is extremely

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.980
different in small-scale
societies where there is

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.910
roughly, according to this
research, no tendency to be

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.300
taken in by these extensions.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.830
To Western society--

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.320
this is Evanston, Illinois,
and South Africa--

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:03.160
a tendency to find this illusion
massively compelling.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.030
Now whether or not these data
ultimately hold up, it's

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.670
complicated to determine because
the research was done

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.570
almost 50 years ago when the
tools for asking these

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.620
questions held themselves to
different standards than

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.060
people hold themselves today,
it's nonetheless not

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.640
implausible to think that
this might be true.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.332
Experience determines
all sorts of things.

00:36:34.332 --> 00:36:37.420
And it's not unimaginable that
among the things that it would

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:44.620
determine is what sorts of
perceptual features you pick

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.000
up on when encountering
a situation.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.070
It is, at the very least,
undeniable that there are

00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.870
fundamental and interesting
differences between the

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.340
tendency of those raised in
Eastern cultures and the

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:10.390
tendency of those raised in
Western cultures to avail

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:16.360
themselves of the two kinds
of fundamental reasoning

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.580
processes which are available
to all of us.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.630
So you know, both from your
readings for today and from

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.690
our readings on the dual
processing tradition earlier

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:34.440
in the semester, that human
beings are capable both of

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.830
what is called holistic
processing.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:41.680
That is orienting towards an
object as embedded in a

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.630
context, paying attention to
relationships between the

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:50.150
focal object and the field that
surrounds it and having a

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:54.110
tendency as a result to make
predictions and offer

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:59.470
explanations on the basis of
these relational properties.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.040
So that's one kind
of thinking.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.330
And all of us have
it available.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.800
But there is, in addition, a
second kind of thinking, which

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.960
every adult human being has
available to him and her:

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.430
analytic processing, through
which, one orients towards an

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:22.150
object as considered in
isolation, pays attention

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.960
primarily to the object
attributes, not to features of

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:31.250
its surround and exhibits a
tendency to predict and

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:36.520
explain events on the basis
of such attributes.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.680
So you'll remember when we
were reading the Doris

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.430
critique of Aristotle and the
suggestion was made that it's

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:52.800
not features of the individual
himself, not attributes of the

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.420
object, that determine how it is
that somebody will act in a

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.880
potentially morally demanding
situation.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.880
But rather features of his
relationship to his context.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.240
Whether he's found a dime
in the phone booth,

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.300
whether he's in a rush.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.790
The claim that Doris makes in
offering that critique of

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.950
Aristotle, a version of what's
called the fundamental

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.940
attribution error, is that there
are cases where analytic

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.640
processing leads us awry and
holistic processing does a

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.890
better job of explaining.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:35.920
There are, likewise, cases where
focusing our attention

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.470
profoundly on the object itself
and not attending to

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:46.320
irrelevant features of the
environment will leave us

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.400
better off.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:54.730
It is striking, given that
that there appear to be

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:59.350
reliable and statistically
significant differences over

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:06.600
time in members of Western and
non-Western cultures with

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.700
regard to which of these
attitudes they

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.760
take on as a default.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.150
So in a series of articles that
have been written over

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.610
roughly the last decade, Richard
Nisbett and a number

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:26.660
of collaborators have presented
subjects with cues

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.430
like the following.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.780
They're shown a series of fish
against a particular

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.910
background.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.970
And then shown a series of novel
fish, either with the

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.530
same or different backgrounds.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.970
Or a series of polar bears or
elk against a particular

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:52.600
background and then either
novel or previously seen

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.540
objects against either a
similar or different

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.050
background.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:05.150
So what advantage do subjects
demonstrate when they see an

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.260
object that they've seen before
against a familiar

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.130
background?

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.100
For the Japanese individuals,
whom Nisbett and his

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:20.450
collaborators tested, an
object seen against its

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.560
original background yields
a high accuracy rate.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.580
If you show it without a
background at all, there's

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.340
less accuracy.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.230
And if you show it against a
novel background, there's a

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.480
striking decrement
in performance.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.710
And again with the wolves.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.280
If you show it against
the original

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.650
background, high accuracy.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.900
Show it against the
novel background,

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.800
a significant decrement.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.470
These are clean patterns.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.010
What happens with Western
subjects?

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.950
Different pattern altogether.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:02.540
Original background doesn't
help re-identification.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.690
No background helps a lot.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.950
The distraction of additional
information has been removed.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:15.320
And a novel background doesn't
leave them much worse off than

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.790
the original.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.440
Ditto with the wolves.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:25.110
Original background produces
some, but not much, advantage.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.850
I'm going to skip the next
example, which suggests, and

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:33.280
you'll be able to watch this
yourselves on the slides that

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.950
I post, that again there are
contexts in which Westerners

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.920
appear to be better at absolute
tasks, non-Westerners

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.070
at relative tasks.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.630
Now what sort of business
do we have making these

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.490
generalizations about
cultures?

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:57.110
Isn't this an outrageous sort
of thing to be doing?

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:02.860
The claim is not that culture
determines everything about an

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.460
individual.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.320
The claim is merely the
unsurprising one that growing

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.990
up in circumstances where your
attention is, as a matter of

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:20.160
course, directed in particular
ways, will lead you exactly in

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.930
the ways that Aristotle
suggested, to find those ways

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:29.890
of responding to be natural
and habitual.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.310
So what I want to do in the
closing five minutes of the

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:39.720
lecture is to give you a final
example from the WEIRD paper.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:46.050
To run you through some of the
cases on which the claim that

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:49.820
Americans stand out relative
to other westerners on

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.550
phenomena that are associated
with independent self-concept

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.870
and individualism is based.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:59.390
So these are all clicker
questions.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:02.480
And they are a series of survey
questions that, at

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.130
least 15 years ago, typically
produced very different

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:13.490
responses in North American
educated subjects than they

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:18.850
did in citizens of other
Western and non-Western

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.640
industrialized nations.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.250
In particular, different
responses among Americans than

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:29.690
they produced among Germans or
Australians or Japanese.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.150
So I'm just going to give you
a series of questions.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.420
We're going to see how your
numbers come out.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.570
And we'll compare them to how
those data looked in the

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.980
original studies.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.620
So here's your first question.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.230
"While you are talking and
sharing a bottle of beer"--

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.520
I know none of you would ever do
this, this is something to

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.620
imagine for when you grow up--

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.970
"when you are talking and
sharing a bottle of beer with

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.830
a friend who is officially on
duty as a safety controller in

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.990
the company where you both
work, an accident occurs

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.950
injuring a shift worker.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.700
An investigation is launched
by the national safety

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.020
commission and you are asked
for your evidence.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.550
There are no other witnesses.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:12.700
What right has your friend to
expect you to protect him?

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.070
A, a definite right.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.320
B, some right.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.920
D, no right." So investigating
commission, do you protect

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.870
your friend?

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.510
Let's see how the numbers
come out.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:32.800
8% of you think there
is a definite right.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.450
48% of you think there
is some right.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.840
And 44% of you think
there is no right.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:46.810
OK let's see whether we can get
these numbers up again.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.230
Gosh, OK, I was going to show
you how your numbers compare

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.570
to the traditional numbers
that were ascertained.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.450
What I'm going to do is leave
these slides up for you as

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.550
always and you can go and
check the comparison.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:05.560
The idea is that in the original
studies, Americans

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:12.250
showed, 94% of them in this
column, you show 92% of you in

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.320
the two of these.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.630
Whereas if you looked across
other countries, people gave

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:18.505
different answers.

00:46:18.505 --> 00:46:25.120
The claim is not that one or the
other of these outlooks is

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.640
a legitimate one.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.020
The claim is just to alert you
to the fact that there are

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:34.010
radical differences in how
people think about the world.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.550
Let's try the next one.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:39.510
So I don't know why we've
got the reveal here.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:44.800
So don't pay no attention to the
numbers that appear here.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.835
Do you think "that only
real goal of a company

00:46:48.835 --> 00:46:50.780
is to make a profit?

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.450
Or do you think B, that a
company, besides making a

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.700
profit has the goal of attaining
the well-being of

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:03.400
various stakeholders such as
employees, stockholders and

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:13.220
others?" Your numbers suggest
a tendency to think that it

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.242
has other goals as well.

00:47:16.242 --> 00:47:19.770
But 33% of you think the only
goal of a company is profit.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:26.580
Among Japanese citizens surveyed
in 1993, only 8% sat

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.500
where 33% of you sit.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.880
"If you apply for a job in a
company," is your thought,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.210
"one, that you will almost
certainly work there for the

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:41.390
rest of your life?" Or is your
thought that "you are almost

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:49.840
sure that the relationship will
have a limited duration?"

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.050
Let's see how these look.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.950
8% of you think you will
work there for the

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:00.720
rest of your life.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.040
92% percent, limited duration.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:08.080
By contrast, if you look at the
numbers here, you are with

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.330
the Americans.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.060
60% of Japanese asked that
similar question gave the

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.220
answer that you did.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:24.190
Over and over and over again--
and I'll leave you three more

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.690
examples on the slide
to look at--

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:31.950
you see that whatever it
is that you are like --

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.470
if you are like the Japanese
with 41% you were different

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.900
from the Americans, if you were
like the Americans with

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.590
99%, you were different
than the Japanese --

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:46.340
the cultural environment in
which you find yourself plays

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.010
a role in determining
your outlook.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.760
And we'll begin next lecture
with an acceleration of a

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:57.660
particular version of this in
the context of Cass Sunstein's

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.390
discussion of social norms.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:04.180
Let me remind you that Thursday
is Bulldog day.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:09.080
And if possible, if as many of
you as can will sit over on

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.200
this side of the room to leave
seats for our visiting

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.310
students, that would be
much appreciated.

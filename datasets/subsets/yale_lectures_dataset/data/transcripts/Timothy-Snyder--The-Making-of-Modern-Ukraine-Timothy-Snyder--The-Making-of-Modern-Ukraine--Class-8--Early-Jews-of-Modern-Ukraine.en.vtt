00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:03.064
(mysterious music)

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.050
- All right, good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.280
My name is Maksimas Milta.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.480
I am a graduate student

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.850
at European and Russian
Studies program here at Yale,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.180
and also one of the teaching
fellows for this class,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.520
and as the syllabus says,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.900
today's lecture is focused

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
on the history of Jews in Ukraine,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.980
and we learned earlier

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.070
that Jews are among those
people who lived the longest

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.200
in the territory of modern-day Ukraine,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.720
and hence, the topic of today,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.120
and the lecture will be today delivered

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.613
by our special guest,
Professor Glenn Dynner.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.760
Glenn Dynner is the
Carl and Dorothy Bennett

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.530
Professor of Judaic Studies

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
and director of Bennett Center
at Fairfield University.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.460
Since 2014, he has served
as a professor of religion

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
and chair of religion department
at Sarah Lawrence College.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.990
Professor Dynner holds a
PhD from Brandeis University

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.720
in the Department of Near
Eastern and Judaic Studies,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.190
and his scholarship focuses

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.560
mostly on Eastern European Jewry,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.970
and more specifically,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.090
on the social history of
Hasidism and Haskalah,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.730
also known as Jewish Enlightenment.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.970
He also works on the topics
of Polish Jewish relations,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
Jewish economic history,
and popular religion.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.320
Professor Dynner is the author
of two award-winning books.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.427
One of them is called "Men of Silk:

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:33.690
"The Hasidic Conquest of
Polish Jewish Society,"

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.277
and the other one is
called "Yankel's Tavern:

00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:39.960
"Jews, Liquor, and Life
in the Kingdom of Poland."

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.820
Currently, Professor
Dynner works on the book

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.537
titled "The Light of Learning:

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.970
"The Hasidic Revival in Poland
on the Eve of the Holocaust."

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.803
For those of you

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:51.510
who consider an academic
career in your future,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.920
I'd like to emphasize the fact

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.610
that Professor Dynner is
also a coeditor of "Shofar,"

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.550
a journal of interdisciplinary
Jewish studies,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.800
and he also serves on the editorial boards

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.510
of "POLIN" and "East European
Jewish Affairs" journals.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.530
He's a member of several

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
Jewish studies related
advisory and academic boards,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.970
including YIVO,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.160
and also, an academic advisory board

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.890
of the Fortunoff Archive here at Yale.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.660
Professor Dynner, welcome to Yale,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.830
and thank you for joining us.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.320
- Okay, thanks, Max.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.200
(audience clapping)

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.033
Thank you.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.850
Yeah, it's great to be here.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.850
I guess you figured out
I'm not Timothy Snyder,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.040
and I teach at Fairfield,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.980
which is down the highway a little bit,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.060
and I missed my exit,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.050
and somehow I wind up here,
which is a great honor,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.220
so I'm gonna be talking a little bit

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.760
about the Jews of Ukraine
up to the year 1648.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.290
I understand you guys came up

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.960
to the Battle of Grunwald in 1410,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.060
so I'm gonna go a little bit beyond that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.460
because honestly, not a whole lot is known

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.050
about the Jewish communities

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.350
in this part of Eastern
Europe before then,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.700
and so we're gonna go through all this,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.863
and we're gonna come up to 1648.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.280
I assume, to this point,
you've really been learning

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
about the story of
colonizers and the colonized.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.180
Colonizers being Lithuanians,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
and then Poles, which you're
just starting to get into,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.590
and the colonized being
Ukrainians in this part.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.530
What I would like to talk about today

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.810
is a third very prominent group,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.460
and that's the Jewish community,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.737
which is neither one
of these things, right?

00:03:31.737 --> 00:03:35.070
The Jews constitute a diaspora group,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.510
meaning they're without
a homeland, so to speak.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.803
They're a guest,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.950
and they have to somehow mediate

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.763
between these colonizers
and the colonized.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.140
There's certain advantages
to being a diaspora group,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.210
if you think about it.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.560
They have a pretty far-flung

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.983
social and mercantile network.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.320
They speak their own language

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.760
and are able to cultivate,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.150
you know, an elite culture

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.103
or subculture in these parts,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.313
and, you know,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.480
it's a situation of

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.120
where they're able to
obtain economic niches

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.070
and have a great deal of mobility.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.020
Those things are true.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.550
However, it's also a situation
of physical vulnerability.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.970
The Jews are members of a,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.330
well, ostensibly problematic religion,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.540
and, you know, as a result of this,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.740
they really wind up serving
the more powerful groups,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.643
meaning the Lithuanian
and the Polish colonizers,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.170
and this works out for a while

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.260
until they really pay a
horrible price for this,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.820
you know, because Ukrainians

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.790
are gonna rise up under Chmielnicki,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.870
and Chmielnicki is an anticolonial hero

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.640
from a Ukrainian perspective,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.140
but from a Jewish perspective,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.230
after a series of horrific massacres,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.230
you know, Chmielnicki, for
them, is a vicious persecutor,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.083
and this is kind of the
price that they pay.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.800
I wanna start with the bad news

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.360
and then move on to better news.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.360
The bad news is Jews, as
you probably figured out,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.833
are a pariah group,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.130
as some of the things
I mentioned indicate,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.863
and that has very deep roots here.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.020
It goes all the way back, in
fact, to early church fathers.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.100
The most benign,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.810
and, I would say, the formula
that's basically adopted

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.560
throughout most of real everyday life

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.210
is probably that one

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.810
that's attributable to Augustine, okay?

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.560
And we'll go into that in a minute,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.960
but first, I just want
to address this image,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.270
which, if you can make it out,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.970
is really a kind of image of ambivalence

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.850
because over here on this side

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.300
you have Jewish merchants, traders.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.120
They don't look very prosperous.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.020
On the other side, you have
peasants in their holiday garb,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.717
and the painter is called (indistinct),

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.430
who would paint Polish and
Ukrainian kind of everyday life,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.143
landscapes, and depict sort
of scenes of everyday life.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.210
They're together.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.223
They're gathered in front of a tavern,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.390
but you can tell they're
pretty apart, right?

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.140
They're divided by their dress.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.240
They're divided by their language.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.483
You know, Jews are speaking
Yiddish, predominantly,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.230
and the peasants have
their own local dialect.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.970
It's gonna be a Slavic language,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.483
and there's little kind of
communication between them.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.860
The Jews are also involved
in very different activity,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.920
you know, as traders, as petty merchants,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.920
compared to the peasants who,
on their holiday are dancing,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.350
and they're enjoying
themselves, probably drinking,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.690
and inside, if we went in there,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.123
we would probably see
a Jewish tavernkeeper.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.250
Jews leased taverns and
distilleries from the nobility.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.650
The vast majority of
taverns and distilleries

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.000
throughout these regions
were actually run by Jews,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.750
and you really have
sort of a, I would say,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.330
an interaction, but not
an integration, right?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.130
An interaction within

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.130
very prescribed social categories.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.090
You can call it a symbiosis

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.960
because Jews are providing
essential services,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.450
the peasants providing
essential services to them,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.720
but, of course, it can also
develop into real animosity,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.200
misunderstanding, resentment,
and outright violence,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.193
so that's why I would call it
a situation of ambivalence.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.060
Where does the pariah status come from?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.620
If we go back to Augustine,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.100
I'd like to look at this text very closely

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.383
because it looks like anti-Semitism,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.043
but it's not really intended to be so.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.347
This is from his "Contra Faustum":

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:23.917
"It is not, as you say,
not by bodily death

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:28.110
"shall the ungodly race
of carnal Jews perish,"

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.205
and what he's basically
saying is you can't kill Jews.

00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:34.770
You know, they may have rejected Christ,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.090
but they live among us,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.920
and they're not to be harmed bodily,

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.020
and this is in a context

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.230
of forced conversions at this time period,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.780
you know, outright violence and death,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.290
and so he's really
actually proscribing this.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.747
He's forbidding this kind of thing.

00:08:52.747 --> 00:08:54.697
"For whoever destroys them in this way,

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:57.660
"shall suffer sevenfold vengeance,"

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.340
that is, shall bring upon
himself the sevenfold penalty

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.870
under which the Jews lie for
the crucifixion of Christ,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.750
and so he is blaming Jews
for the death of Christ,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.280
and deicide,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.940
or at least the murder of
the human embodiment of God,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.293
is a pretty heavy penalty,

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.500
so to the end of the seven days of time,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.350
the continued preservation of the Jews

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.060
will be proof to believing Christians

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.350
of the subjection merited

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.020
by those who, in the
pride of their kingdom,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.763
put the Lord to death,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.740
and here is perhaps the most
dangerous formula of all

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.410
because what it's basically saying is

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.760
Jews are to be kept around
in a state of misery, right?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.540
As witness to what happens
when you reject Christ,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.073
but they're to be kept around.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.580
Now, the reason why I
consider this so dangerous is

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.640
what happens when Jews
don't fulfill that role

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.250
of misery, of subjection?

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.630
What happens then?

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.160
What happens when they're perceived

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.040
as maybe violating that hierarchy,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.843
even subverting that hierarchy?

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.060
And, of course, at the heart
of anti-Semitism is the claim

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.320
of excessive Jewish power,
influence, and wealth,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.360
and all these things come into play,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.400
so what I'm asking is

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.400
is this formula a license to kill

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.140
when that, the Jewish part of the deal

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.220
is not held up, right?

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.983
The subjection or the misery,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.390
and, you know, I think
that kind of explains

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.610
the trajectory that we're gonna follow.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.410
Most of the time,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.960
most of the time, Jews are gonna lead

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.080
a relatively prosperous
and stable existence,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.610
but then there are these episodes,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.220
extremely violent devastating episodes,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.997
today, what we would call
genocide in some cases, you know,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.590
and, you know, are Jews
even aware of this bargain?

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.090
Are they aware of this formula?

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.400
It seems they are, to an extent,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.920
because rabbinical leaders
will actually forbid

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.630
ostentatious display

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.780
like jewelry and fancy clothing
and that kind of a thing,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.100
and they'll try very hard,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.450
but it's very hard to
control such things also.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.220
That being said, so
we've got this kind of,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.520
I would say, dangerous
balancing act, you know,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.390
and it's like a collective balancing act

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.600
and this collective sense of ambivalence.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.953
That being said,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.980
most of the Jews of the world

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.290
are going to move to
this part of the world,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.270
not all the Ukraine.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.370
It's gonna be, also, you know,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.000
the Polish kingdom and other
lands in Eastern Europe,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.680
but it's pretty incredible.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.770
75% of the world's Jewish population

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.943
is going to reside in Eastern
Europe by the 19th century,

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.360
and there's a reason for that.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.370
It can't be that horrible
if they're living there.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.380
It certainly can't be that deadly.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.320
The reason for that is that stability

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.020
and relative prosperity.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.360
They have economic autonomy.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.223
They're not allowed to own land,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.793
yet that can also be,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.330
I suppose, an advantage

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.600
because they move into somewhat
more lucrative pursuits

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.830
like trade, crafts, moneylending,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.990
and most importantly
all, as time develops,

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.910
leaseholding from the nobility.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.537
They will lease pretty much all

00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.973
of the nonagricultural
enterprises of the nobles.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.973
Political autonomy.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.260
We're gonna see how they develop
virtually self-government.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.990
Now, later on, anti-Semitic
claims are gonna be

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.330
that they constitute a
state within a state.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.980
I think that goes way too far.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.220
You know, it's all contingent
on the Polish landowners

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.840
who own the vast majority
of land in these areas

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.760
and linguistic autonomy.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.000
The vernacular everyday
language is Yiddish,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.490
a combination of German and Hebrew

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.220
with some Slavic elements thrown in,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.330
and then Hebrew, which
functions a lot like Latin

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.450
as an elite clerical
language, a literary language,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.663
one that's not really spoken
until the rise of Zionism.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.970
Now, we can go way back

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.660
to the origins of Jewish presence

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.540
in what becomes the Ukraine,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.650
but historians will often start

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.440
with the Khazar kingdom,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.360
and it's kind of exciting to historians

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.190
to think that there was a Jewish kingdom.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.100
Supposedly, the king converted to Judaism.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.230
There's a classic called the "Kuzari,"

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.650
which tells this story how
the king had a representative

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.260
from the Christians and
the Jews and the Muslims,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.730
and he chose Judaism,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:00.780
and it's exciting

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.420
because you thought that
it was only ancient Israel.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.250
That was the last time
that you had autonomy,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.580
and suddenly, we find we
have this Jewish kingdom,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.580
and there are little bits
of evidence here and there

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.580
that such a Jewish kingdom existed,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.963
letters, mentionings in chronicles
and that kind of a thing.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.070
It's kind of a mess

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.280
because there are
historians who accept this

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.440
and who devote their whole
careers to writing about this,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.160
and then there are historians
who completely deny it,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.900
who think this whole thing was a myth

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.970
and that all these sources are forged.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.910
Your reading was Dan Shapiro's article.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.119
It's probably the best article
we have on the origins of,

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:46.530
you know, Jewish presence
in the Ukrainian lands.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.780
He kind of, he contradicts himself.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.010
He kind of does both.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.907
On the first page you'll notice he says,

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:55.133
"There was no Jewish elite
that converted," you know,

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:56.730
"in the Khazar kingdom,"

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.130
and then, three three pages
later, he's quoting it.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.150
He's citing it.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.320
He's mentioning it,

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.610
and if you look at the footnote,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.800
he says that Pritzak's book on this,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.960
which goes through a lot of these sources,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.370
is complete nonsense,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.680
and I could write a whole book, you know,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.930
that contains all the
mistakes in this work,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.380
and then, those three pages
later, he's quoting Pritzak,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.560
so, you know, we're all
over the place with this,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.160
and I think part of the problem
is it's been politicized

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.570
because if you are an anti-Zionist,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:28.950
it becomes very interesting,

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.340
the possibility that actually
Jews didn't originate in,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.540
you know, ancient Israel.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.307
They originated in Khazaria,

00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:38.070
and this is something
that the early Zionists

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.140
are actually having to contend with,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.030
and so really, every anti-Zionist

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.160
gets very excited about this possibility,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.110
and, of course, every Zionist historian

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.290
is very interested in refuting

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.050
even the existence of a Jewish
presence in this kingdom,

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.590
so Shaul Stampfer recently
published an article

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.330
in which he went through all these sources

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.210
and showed they were all complete
fabrications and nonsense,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.410
and that's where we are,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.890
so I can't say anything for
sure about the Khazar kingdom

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.240
other than, I don't know,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.460
maybe where there's smoke there's fire.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.960
That may be the best that we can do.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.550
There might have been some indication

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.460
of a Jewish presence there
among certain elites,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.540
but we're on more solid ground

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.223
when we get into Kyivan Rus,

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.743
and here's a map.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.330
I watched a few of Professor
Snyder's YouTube videos,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.580
and I noticed he didn't use a lot of maps,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.090
so here's a good opportunity
to see what it looks like.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.990
Anybody know what the Golden Horde is?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.013
Yeah, what's the Golden,

00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:38.408
well, not asking the grad students going-

00:16:38.408 --> 00:16:39.241
- Mongols.

00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:40.074
- What?

00:16:40.074 --> 00:16:40.907
- The Mongols.
- Mongols, right?

00:16:40.907 --> 00:16:42.720
Do, you know, why it's
called the Golden Horde?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.300
Their battle tents were gold,

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.920
and so that's how they got this name,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.480
and I don't think it's pejorative,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.460
but I'm not 100% sure,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.257
so that's the Mongols over there,

00:16:52.257 --> 00:16:55.890
and we have Jewish presence
is really on an axis,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.190
kind of a diagonal axis
running through Kyiv,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.470
and I looked at a map of trade routes,

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.550
and sure enough,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.910
it's towns along a trade
route leading into Hungary,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.763
and that's how the Jewish
presence is determined there.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.810
It's an unstable existence, you know,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.830
and it's not very permanent,

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.040
and you find little tiny
mentionings here and there.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.120
It's not a sizeable Jewish
presence there at all.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.020
Where it's gonna get much bigger

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.530
is when the Grand Duchy of
Lithuania comes into the picture

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.920
and effectively colonizes these areas.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.740
Now, the Jews are temporarily expelled.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.310
Some link it to the
expulsion of Jews from Spain.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.070
I guess it was a copycat expulsion.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.240
That's what you read sometimes,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.870
but then, when he changes
his mind a few years later,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.070
it's revoked under the same monarch,

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.400
and now you have approximately 4,000 Jews

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.620
in 24 Ukrainian towns.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.780
That doesn't sound like a whole lot.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.600
It's a frontier kind of existence

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.240
where we find evidence of Jews

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.120
actually taking part in
the defense of these towns,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.033
which are under a lot of
pressure from Tatars, especially.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.250
They're learning to shoot.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.160
They're doing even military exercises.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.010
It's not your typical image

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.960
of East European Jews,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.240
so it's kind of interesting,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.950
but they do manage to survive,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.230
and it becomes safer and safer

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.450
as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.960
really sort of concretizes
its presence there,

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.830
and then you start to
have more Jews moving in,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.220
and that's where we are, really,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.020
with our knowledge about these areas.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.883
I mean, there's not a whole lot more,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.810
and we're kind of just
about up to the point

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:49.643
where you are in the...

00:18:49.643 --> 00:18:52.650
I think we're past the point
that you are chronologically,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.870
so now we're gonna go
beyond that a little bit

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.030
for the next 100 years or so,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.080
and this is where Poland,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.810
Crown Poland is gonna
come into the picture,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.350
and I really call this
colonization full-fledged

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.410
because it is kind of a big land grab.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.070
You know, you have Polish
nobles, petty nobles,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.710
magnates, these large landholders,

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.010
coming in and just grabbing
up as much territory

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.573
as they possibly can.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.930
It's the result of the actual agreement

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.590
called the Union of Lublin

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.820
whereby the threat of Russia is such

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.140
that Lithuania kind of
accedes to this agreement,

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.750
which seems to really benefit the Poles.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.270
It's almost like a protection
agreement, it seems like,

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.760
and you'll probably learn
a lot more about it,

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.250
but for our purposes today,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.700
those Polish nobles are
going to bring Jews in

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.110
to settle their towns and
to run their enterprises,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.733
and this is what it looks like,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.140
so the dark gold parts

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.290
are what the Grand Duchy of Lithuania is,

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.320
and these other parts are Poland,

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.400
and this comes to be known

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.250
as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.650
and by 1648,

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.380
you go from 4,000 to 40,000 Jews

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.440
living in 115 Ukrainian towns,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.150
and, you know, that colonizing activity

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.410
is very good for the Jews

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.760
because they have these
economic possibilities.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.193
They're still not allowed to own land,

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.610
but what they do is

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.750
they begin leasing the
various enterprises.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.660
Now, I'm gonna put a question to you.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.210
Why is leaseholding,

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.330
like, leasing a tavern or a mill,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.470
better, from the Jewish
perspective, than owning it?

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.030
And I'll give you a big hint.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.783
They're leasing it from
the all-powerful nobility.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.073
Any ideas why it's better
to lease than to own?

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.394
Yeah.

00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:09.120
- You have the protection of the nobles.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.380
- You got it right away.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.450
It's you have the protection the nobles.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.540
Nobody is going to burn down a tavern

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.340
if it belongs to the noblemen,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.870
but as, I mentioned before, you know,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.900
Jews are in a very physically
vulnerable situation,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.760
so this leaseholding arrangement

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.360
is actually very beneficial to Jews

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.730
because they get noble protection,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.590
at least from that standpoint.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.410
They're also being taxed
pretty mercilessly,

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.320
and the nobles don't
want their best taxpayers

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.440
to be, you know, physically
assaulted either,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.430
so it's not the most stable situation,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.190
but it's one of, it's good enough.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.140
You know, they have Polish protection.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.020
Now, what's in it for
the nobility? Why Jews?

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.490
And I'll give you another hint.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.470
It's not because they like Jews.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.510
In fact, it's very much the opposite,

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.090
so why would you invite Jews in

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.040
to lease your various enterprises?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.093
Any ideas?

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.103
Yeah?

00:22:10.103 --> 00:22:11.970
- Maybe so you can, like,
keep your eye on them,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.350
make sure that they're not doing

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.850
anything you don't want them to be doing.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.683
- For sure.

00:22:15.683 --> 00:22:18.360
I mean, there's a lot of
control involved as well,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.010
but okay, yeah?

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.280
- Wasn't moneylending
sort of like unbelief?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.620
- Okay, good, so it's not quite true.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.750
You know, you do have actual
banks, at a certain point,

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.060
the nobles can borrow from,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.310
but there are a lot of
hoops to jump through,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.450
and Jews represent easy credit,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.150
you know, and you're in a
socially superior position

00:22:44.622 --> 00:22:45.810
to your creditor,

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.970
so that becomes very tempting,

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.240
and Jews are involved
very much in moneylending,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.860
and it's funny because what
I base a lot of this on

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.520
is an article, a series of
articles by Shmuel Ettinger.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.540
They're in Hebrew,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.610
so most of you wouldn't
have access to them,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.930
but they're the most, I would say,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.320
full information about this
time period and this place,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.080
and he spends a lot of
pages trying to argue

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.320
that Jews really weren't that
involved in moneylending,

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.210
but then he contradicts himself too.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.460
I think moneylending has a bad image,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.690
but the fact of the matter is

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.700
people needed credit, you know,

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.250
and this is where they could
get it, for the most part,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.740
so yes, moneylending's a big part of it.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.820
Anything else about Jews

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.520
that makes them attractive
as leaseholders?

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.480
Yeah?

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.130
- Does it have something
to do with the fact that

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.180
because they're just,

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.510
they can't enter other industries
or they can't own land,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.325
then there's guarantee that
they'll serve that role or that-

00:23:40.325 --> 00:23:41.158
- Very much so.

00:23:41.158 --> 00:23:43.830
I would call it a captive service sector.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.473
You know, they don't
have a lot of options.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.480
Yeah.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.680
- Because they're not necessarily

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.000
paying a tithe to the church,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.153
maybe they're (indistinct) be
a good source of tax revenue.

00:23:55.176 --> 00:23:56.009
Is that-
- Okay,

00:23:56.009 --> 00:23:57.300
so that's a complicated question.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.120
Yes, they're great source of tax revenue,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.400
but believe me, they're paying
more taxes than anybody.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.980
They're paying taxes to the crown,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.540
and we'll go into that a little bit.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.010
They don't pay tithe to the church.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.390
That's actually an interesting point

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.280
that I haven't thought about a lot,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.600
so that's a great point,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.880
but they're paying so many other ways,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.620
including to their own communities,

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.370
and I'm not, it probably
offsets, but absolutely.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.203
Now, one thing

00:24:21.203 --> 00:24:25.590
nobody thought of yet is politics.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.290
No matter how wealthy

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.320
your Jewish leaseholder
is going to become,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.590
and some of them really do
quite well by this system,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.550
they're never gonna be a
political threat to you, okay?

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.610
And I can add other
things, business acumen,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:45.090
you know, historically involved in trade.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.930
Where they came from was

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.310
Western and Central Europe,

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.460
especially the German-
and Czech-speaking lands,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.230
and in those areas,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.850
they worked as merchants a lot of the time

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.060
until they were pushed
out by the townspeople.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.860
They're also being pushed out

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.510
of parts of Poland proper, we
could call it, Crown Poland,

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.170
by the same Christian
townspeople, and they're moving.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.360
They're being pushed into these areas,

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.163
so it's actually,

00:25:18.598 --> 00:25:19.917
it's a great boon to the Jews

00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:22.140
who are losing opportunities in one place

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.870
to be able to come to another place,

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.720
but, of course, this is
all a colonial scheme,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.100
so it's volatile.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.450
It's dangerous, you know.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.440
Jews are running these leases,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.220
but, you know, they're not
very popular with the peasants

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.480
who are now being enserfed,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.060
and this is like a second
serfdom, it's called,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.880
and so there we have

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.160
Augustine's rule being violated

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.640
because they're in a
position of superiority

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.050
to the surrounding peasants

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.313
by running these taverns and
mills and tolls and so on.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.970
It becomes a real problem.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.490
It becomes intolerable.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.010
Now, this is the reason
they're not allowed to own land

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.870
because if they own land,

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.420
they're gonna be lording
it directly over peasants

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.585
who are farmers, essentially,
and that's intolerable.

00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:15.060
It just, the optics are too bad,

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.770
but to run a tavern and a mill and so on,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.810
that's seen as okay

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:23.370
except from the perspective
of the peasants,

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.690
who really experience this
in a negative way, obviously,

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.900
and, you know, we have a volatile system,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.240
but it's held in place

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.483
as long as the Polish
nobility is in power,

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.000
and here's the thing.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.800
The nobility doesn't want the headache

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.100
of collecting taxes
directly from these Jews.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.740
Plus, they can't be trusted to,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.030
you know, pay their taxes,

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.830
and they all seem to have the same name,

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.080
like Yitzchak ben Moshe and so on.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.150
You know, there's like
17 of them in one town,

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.140
and so what they do is they
entrust the Jewish communities,

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.900
first Jewish tax collectors, specifically,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.140
and then the kahals, which is
the Jewish self-government,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.990
to collect the taxes for them,

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:17.220
and in the process,
they're giving the kahal...

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.220
I guess you'd compare
it to a municipality.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.960
They're giving the kahals
complete autonomy, almost,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.080
to run daily affairs,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.610
to manage the garbage collection
and keep the streets clean

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.750
and try to make sure

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.080
people don't encroach
on each other's leases,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.143
and they manage the educational system,

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.840
and they start to develop

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.830
these extensive instruments of autonomy

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.663
to the point where

00:27:47.663 --> 00:27:50.250
when there are disputes
between communities,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.143
they develop regional councils,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.380
and then, a real game changer

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.447
is when the crown basically says,

00:27:58.447 --> 00:28:01.327
"Okay, we just want a lump
sum from you," you know?

00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:04.627
"Forget about the individual
communities collecting taxes.

00:28:04.627 --> 00:28:06.270
"Give us one lump sum,"

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.500
and then the Grand Duchy of
Lithuania says the same thing,

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.260
and that's when developing out of that

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.210
is the Council of Four Lands,

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.920
which is kind of like functioning

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.760
as not just a supreme IRS,
a supreme tax collector,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.410
but a supreme court

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.890
that's adjudicating disputes
between communities,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.370
that deals with, really, you
call them national problems,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.400
a blood libel accusation,
a ritual murder accusation,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.370
the accusation that Jews
have killed a Christian child

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.410
and used their blood for their,

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.210
used the blood for their rituals,

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.490
which never happened, I should emphasize,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.400
but it was kind of like the
rumor that refused to go away

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.630
because it symbolically
reenacts the crucifixion,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.733
and it has a lot of resonance that way,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.060
so, you know, this Council of Four Lands

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.390
would have somebody intervene

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.250
and try to prevent, you know,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.200
this thing from getting out of control.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.780
They would negotiate the taxes,

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.040
and they would serve as a
supreme court in secular matters.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.460
Now, each kahal also
had a rabbinical court,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.420
so the entire Jewish community
is known as the kehila.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.460
It's run by the kahal,

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.500
but they also have rabbis

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.290
who are sort of separate from everything.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.310
That Council of Four
Lands is mainly merchants,

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.540
is mainly wealthy merchants
and leaseholders, okay?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.460
The rabbis meet separately,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.160
and they tend to judge religious matters,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.270
which makes a lot of sense

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.480
until you try to figure out
what a religious matter is.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.713
It's not so clear.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.160
Murder seems to be a religious matter.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.580
Theft, kind of, but it's
also a business matter,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.340
so there's a lot of, like,
jurisdictional disputes going on

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.800
between rabbinical courts and lay courts,

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.820
but by and large, you know,

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.590
when things are functioning smoothly,

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.180
they support each other,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.290
and there's a actual power

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.030
to excommunicate members

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.620
that's never really used,

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.290
but the threat of
excommunication, called the herem,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.480
is enough to scare people

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.230
into obeying the authority
of these various courts

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.950
because being excommunicated
would really be truly horrible.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.020
You know, you would
really have no place to go

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.840
in Christian society, in Jewish society,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.880
and it's like social death,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.990
and a really devastating
condition to be in.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.890
It's never used

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.040
until the rise of the
false messianic movement

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.890
of Shabbetai Tzvi, which happens later on.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.080
We'll maybe touch upon at the very end.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.590
Now, a shtadlan is a
very important function.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.080
The shtadlan is a lobbyist,

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.970
and every community would have one.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.760
He speaks the language of the land.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.290
He knows the laws really well.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.670
He's charming

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.360
and has somewhat of a secular education,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.060
so a lot of times doctors
would serve this purpose,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.030
and he basically is the go-between.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.830
You know, he'll talk to the authorities

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.000
when something goes wrong,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.170
and this is kind of like,

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.707
you know, Jewish foreign
policy, you could call it.

00:31:05.707 --> 00:31:08.640
You know, this is how they
defend their communities,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.660
through lobbying, yes,
through giving of bribes.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.910
I mean, this was actually
totally on the books,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.870
out in the open.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.850
It was a normal way of doing business.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.120
You bribed the secular officials
to protect your community,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.673
and no one seemed to see
anything wrong with that.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.060
Now, with this extensive autonomy,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.600
really, the most extensive
autonomy since antiquity,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.350
you also have the development
of vibrant religious life

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.810
and the wooden synagogues.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.160
Here's one in Khodoriv in
the Ukrainian territories.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.270
They can develop very
ornate, beautiful artwork

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.650
even though they're wooden synagogues,

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.303
which suggests less wealth.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.900
Beautiful ceiling paintings.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.890
Down in the corner there,
I put an image of this guy,

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.780
who's chained to the
synagogue wall outside

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.370
by his neck.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.053
Any idea what he did wrong?

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.113
He broke the Sabbath,

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.890
so this is actually called the kuna,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.280
and I put it there to remind
us not to get too nostalgic

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.620
about this flourishing religious life

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.380
'cause there's a lot of religious
compulsion involved too.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.380
You know, keeping the
Sabbath was not a choice,

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.140
at least not throughout
this period of time,

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.270
and if you go to the town
of Czestochowa in Poland,

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.460
you can actually see one of
these on the synagogue wall.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.663
It's pretty interesting.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.870
Most people could pay a fine
and get out of it, you know,

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.610
and they would prefer to pay the fine

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.740
than be publicly humiliated in this way,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.793
but it was there.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.530
Now, Jews are able to move into cities,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.770
but again, you come into direct conflict

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.570
with the Christian townspeople,

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:56.570
and economics is
something that's perceived

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.410
in an ethnic way, right?

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:03.410
There are groups against
groups, Christians against Jews,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.120
and the Christians manage to exact

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.970
a lot of money and payment
from Jewish merchants,

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.150
so it becomes very expensive
to do business in cities,

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.660
and that's where your
leaseholding comes in,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.050
and the official word for lease is arenda.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.700
You may see it in your readings.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.970
The arenda can be a lease on
everything we've talked about

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:28.800
and some things we didn't talk
about: tolls on roads, ponds.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.600
You can lease the tax,

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.890
and then you get to keep anything

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.410
over the amount that you collect.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:38.070
You can lease entire villages,
taverns, and distilleries.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.910
This is an absolute boon

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.263
to Jews, economically,

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.700
but let's just say it's
not good to be a serf

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.380
in this situation,

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.140
and the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth comes to be known,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.090
as I don't know if
you've heard this before,

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.160
heaven for the nobles,
paradise for the Jews,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.510
and hell for the serfs.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.600
The reason is this is an arrangement

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.400
that is not only economically
debilitating for the serfs

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.020
who have to continually work,

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.450
you know, the nobleman's land for free

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:11.760
along with whatever land they're
able to work of their own,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.680
which is very small.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.050
They have to, you know,

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.620
pay the Jewish tavernkeeper.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.693
They have to pay the Jewish miller.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.580
There are even rumors that
Jews lease the churches

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.620
and held keys to the churches,

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.880
which would be really humiliating,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.880
but some historians have said
that's actually not the case,

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.780
but that is something

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.270
that made its way up
through Ukrainian lore

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.700
is that you even had to
beg to use your own church,

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.890
you know, so it's a really
humiliating situation,

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:43.140
whether that last thing is true or not,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.140
and that's the reason for the volatility,

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:49.890
but nobody's going to attack
the Jewish leaseholder

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:51.420
for the simple reason

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.360
that he's under the
protection of the nobleman.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.690
Nobles own the vast majority of land.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.150
They're increasingly more
powerful than the king,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.390
who becomes an elected monarch,

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.230
and they really, I would say,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.760
they own their own towns,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.180
and those are increasingly
attractive to Jews to settle in.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.673
It's a system of patronage, really.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.163
Now, inside the tavern,

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.470
you have that integration
that I was talking about,

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.573
but it's really more of an interaction,

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.050
and here you have Jewish musicians,

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.000
non-Jews who are dancing,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.470
and you have the Jewish
tavernkeepers over on that side,

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.470
and notice that the
wife of the tavernkeeper

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.940
is pouring the liquor.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.820
I'm not sure whose child
that is in the corner there,

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.860
but children were very much present

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.990
in these taverns as well.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.750
This was where people would
spend their leisure time.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.530
These were also, effectively, news venues,

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.430
entertainment venues,
banks, country stores,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.840
especially in the smaller,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.570
you know, rural areas or small towns.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.870
They were the hub of everything,

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.460
competing, really, with the church,

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.620
you know, because after the wedding,

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.440
you would, you know, proceed
from the church to the tavern,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.970
where you'd be met by the tavernkeeper,

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.430
who's kind of like the antipriest,

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.170
but what I want to emphasize is gender

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:27.150
because women worked in the
society, in Jewish society,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.220
and it was expected.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.620
It wasn't something that
women fought for as a right.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.540
It was absolutely expected.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.960
Your value on the marriage
market was determined

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.773
by what business promise you
could bring to the marriage.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.050
That would often be linguistic,

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:47.040
like, how well you speak Polish
or Ukrainian or whatever,

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.900
how well you know arithmetic,

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.670
and these marriages were
really business partnerships.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.460
Usually, the husband would be
dealing with the suppliers.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.020
He might drive a taxi,

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.380
you know, a horse and
cart during the week.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.430
The woman would be, the wife
would be serving the customers,

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.160
and it's a pretty rough lifestyle,

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.590
but why that's important is

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.390
the Jewish familial unit

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.650
presents a kind of double-barrel
threat economically

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.500
because both the husband
and wife are working,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.290
and this is absolutely the norm.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.360
Occasionally, you have the situation

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.600
where an extremely learned
and accomplished rabbi

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.610
would study all day long

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.650
and the wife would work in the marketplace

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.730
or in the tavern, whatever,

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.303
but that was a pretty
rare occurrence, okay.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.150
Now, one arenda dispute

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.600
that I went through pretty extensively

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.450
illustrates the problem with authority,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.410
the way things stand,

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.970
and the importance of the development

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.700
of the Council of Four
Lands, that supreme court.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.950
I just wanna go through
this really quickly

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.940
because what happens in
this situation of leases,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.610
and this is probably a
tavern that's being leased,

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.910
is competition between Jews, okay?

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.260
In this case, Simeon
leases a liquor arenda.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.930
Reuben attempts to purchase
it for the next three years

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.290
before his term is up,
so he's the encroacher,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.140
and then, Simeon goes and negotiates

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.260
with the local nobleman,
successfully, who gives it to him.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.590
Reuben, in this case, goes
all the way to the queen

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.860
and gets her scribe to support his side,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.700
and he tells the town council
to award the lease to Reuben.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.170
The towns council agree,

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.480
town council agrees, but for a bribe.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.950
Reuben pays the bribe.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.840
Simeon bribes the nobleman,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.730
so lots of bribes going on here,

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.160
and offers an even higher price,

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.890
and the nobleman orders the town council

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.510
to withdraw it from Reuben,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.660
and then the queen steps
in and supports Reuben,

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.070
so you have, like,

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:59.340
these conflicting secular
authorities that get involved,

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.260
which leads me to think it's
much more than a tavern.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.780
It could be, you know, an
entire right to distill,

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.880
which is called (speaks
in foreign language),

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.310
but it's something that
is pretty lucrative,

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.710
so they actually don't
stop with the authorities,

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.150
not even the queen.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.980
They now go to the rabbis,

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.550
and the rabbis are extremely
prominent in this society,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.160
which is a, you know,
community of believers.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.560
Some of these rabbis
have their own yeshivas,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.510
these Talmudic academies,

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:29.190
where they teach the Talmud all day long,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.430
but when disputes occur

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:37.430
that have to do with some
aspect of Jewish law, halakha,

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.920
they will often send questions
to the most prominent rabbis,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.710
and this is what happens in this case,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.943
so Rabbi Isaac Ben Bezalel of Volodymyr,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.690
he argues in favor of Simeon,

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.050
and he quotes a medieval German source

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.920
to basically say, "Do not encroach," okay?

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.943
So he's basically anti-Reuben,
anti-encroachment,

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.510
but then they go to a
more prominent rabbi,

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.860
Isaac Luria, who's young, but
he's kind of a rising star,

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.640
and he actually rules in favor of Reuben

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.310
and says that the laws of
encroachment don't apply

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.520
'cause this is only a
potential purchase, right?

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.180
The lease term hadn't begun
yet, so it's a potential,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.700
it's like the next
three years of the term,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.647
and he says, "It's known
in the entire kingdom

00:40:32.647 --> 00:40:35.077
"that we buy the right
to farm taxes and liquor

00:40:35.077 --> 00:40:37.740
"and other rights in the town
with an arenda contract,"

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.320
and they're also accustomed
to sell the arenda

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.490
before the term for the first
holder of the arenda expires,

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.610
and they sell it to a second
person, so Reuben's okay.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.740
He's allowed to encroach, okay?

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.510
Now, Luria's young.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.690
He may be brilliant and a
rising star, but he's young,

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.750
so he sends it to an
older rabbinic authority

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.623
for a kind of second
opinion, just to make sure,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.320
and this guy, his name
is Rabbi Joseph Katz,

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.440
and he rules, actually, against him

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.820
and rules in favor of Simeon,

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.040
so you see it's a whole mess.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.890
It's a jurisdictional nightmare,

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.410
and he argues that the
laws of encroachment

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.500
do apply to ownerless property,

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.550
and only when there's a
complete public agreement

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.710
can that law be abrogated,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.050
and we don't know how it's resolved,

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.930
but we do know that about 50 years later,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.940
the Council of Four Lands
finally issues a ruling

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.250
banning any Jew from bidding on an arenda

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.410
that's held by a fellow Jew,

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.670
and then, the Lithuanian
Council steps in and agrees.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:50.400
They reiterate the ban,
and they give a reason:

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.690
Competitive bidding causes
damage to the Jewish community

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.510
by raising the costs
of leasing the arenda,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.670
so now, with the Council of Four Lands,

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.810
which began as, basically,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.380
a tax collecting, you know, institution,

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:09.000
we actually have it regulating
daily life and economic law,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.470
and things start getting
more regulated, more normal,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.050
and more in favor

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.723
of Jewish business practices,

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.270
but there's a downside
to all this liquor sales.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.890
It may be lucrative,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.110
and that's why people
are fighting about it.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.330
Here's a much later depiction.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:34.230
You see a pretty satanic-looking
Jewish tavernkeeper

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.360
who's looking on unconcerned

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.690
as the peasants are drunk and passed out,

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.770
and, you know, this is a
real problem, you know,

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:47.550
and people begin to blame
peasant drunkenness on Jews,

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.710
and they accuse the Jewish tavernkeeper

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.560
of, you know, driving
up his drinking debts

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.720
and taking advantage of the peasantry,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.720
and it causes a lot of social
instability as a result.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.710
Now, on the positive side of things,

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.370
we know from rabbinic takkanot

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.310
that non-Jews were also part of this thing

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.850
and profiting from these arendas on liquor

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.810
because you can't keep a
tavern running on the Sabbath

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.860
if you're Jewish

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.880
or on holidays,

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.180
like we just had the
holiday of Rosh Hashanah.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.300
It's not lawful, so what do they do?

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.540
They have local Christians

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:35.160
helping them to run the
taverns on those days,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.500
and actually, it becomes
a formal partnership

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.950
because that's legally,
halakh-ically, what you have to do,

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:45.250
and so, really, you see a
surprising amount of cooperation

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.930
and, you know, economic
integration going on

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.520
at the local level

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.890
where, if you really wanna spell it out,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.690
Christians are helping Jews

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:58.080
to get around their own
Sabbath restrictions

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.150
so that they can remain profitable

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.430
and they're also making, you know,

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.140
a fair amount of money doing so,

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.590
so there's a fair amount
of cooperation going on.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.050
There are rabbis who are
against this practice,

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.450
strenuously against it,

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.860
and Rabbi Betzalel Darshan of Przemysl

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.520
blames the 1648 massacres

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.130
on this practice itself.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.750
How much time is left?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.583
- About 10 minutes.

00:44:25.583 --> 00:44:27.630
- 10 minutes, good, okay.
(student speaks faintly)

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.010
Six minutes, okay,

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.157
so yeah, in very emotional language,

00:44:33.157 --> 00:44:35.077
"The blood of fathers and sons,

00:44:35.077 --> 00:44:38.257
"the blood of pious men
and children, or women,

00:44:38.257 --> 00:44:40.417
"the blood of saintly men and women

00:44:40.417 --> 00:44:42.697
"and the blood of baby boys and girls

00:44:42.697 --> 00:44:44.857
"still suckling at their mother's breasts

00:44:44.857 --> 00:44:47.887
"who had never sinned or
committed," sorry, "any crime,

00:44:47.887 --> 00:44:50.377
"and the blood of rabbis
and their disciples

00:44:50.377 --> 00:44:52.230
"was spilled like water."

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.050
This is the 1648 uprising,

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.960
and Chmielnicki massacre
of the Jewish communities

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.347
he's talking about.

00:44:59.347 --> 00:45:00.450
"God is righteous."

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.640
We can't blame God for this,

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.400
and notice he's not gonna
blame the Cossacks either.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.377
He's not gonna blame Chmielnicki.

00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:09.487
"It is we who are wicked

00:45:09.487 --> 00:45:12.937
"because of our repeated
desecrations of the Sabbath.

00:45:12.937 --> 00:45:14.737
"A select group,

00:45:14.737 --> 00:45:18.127
"the majority of villagers
who undertake arendas,

00:45:18.127 --> 00:45:22.657
"buy and sell on the Sabbath
through the agency of villagers

00:45:22.657 --> 00:45:24.810
"all in a deceitful manner."

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.760
They also order their gentile servants

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.937
to "do such and such work,

00:45:27.937 --> 00:45:28.987
"and they sit and teach them

00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:31.260
"how to repair what has spoiled the job."

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.060
This has all happening on the Sabbath,

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.170
and, of course,

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.347
God has punished the entire
Jewish community for this.

00:45:38.347 --> 00:45:41.107
"Oy for my eyes, which
saw this many times,

00:45:41.107 --> 00:45:42.720
"and I had no way of protesting."

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.097
Then he goes on, kind
of like a Jewish mother.

00:45:45.097 --> 00:45:48.720
"Now, you see what happens,
and maybe you'll listen to me,"

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.940
and turns out nobody listens to him

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.380
because this practice continues.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.060
It's the only way of running

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.940
a lucrative tavern and distillery.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.360
In fact, rabbis get involved
in writing contracts up

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.580
where they form fictitious partnerships,

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.840
and the practice continues,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.520
but let me go back to
that Chmielnicki uprising

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.730
because it's absolutely devastating,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.780
and yet I'm not gonna
condone massacres, obviously,

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.010
but it's understandable

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.590
the position of Cossacks and Ukrainians.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.030
Now, who are Cossacks?

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.083
They're essentially
peasants who resist serfdom.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.860
They obtain horses and weaponry.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.370
They often will ride down
in the Zaporozhian district

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.050
and make, carry out raids
on the Ottoman territories,

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:40.050
and the Polish army tries to use them

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.510
and register them in the Polish army,

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.040
but then they try to
cut down their numbers,

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.400
and there a series of Cossacks revolts

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.883
against the Polish government,
Polish Lithuanian government,

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.940
and in 1648,

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.830
there's a major uprising
led by Chmielnicki,

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.780
who's a semi-polonized Ukrainian nobleman

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.160
who's been spurned.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.230
He fell in love with a daughter

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.470
of very powerful wealthy Polish nobleman

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.640
who threw him into jail,

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.360
and he broke out and rode
down and fomented rebellion,

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.880
and the rebellion...

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.210
Look, I mean, if they could
reach the Polish nobility,

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.330
they probably would've tried,

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.530
but you can't reach them.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.520
They're too mobile.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.060
They're too powerful, and
so who do they attack?

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.600
The perceived agents
of the Polish nobility,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.880
namely, the Jewish leaseholders

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.740
and other Jews in their midst,

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.220
and Jews are massacred in huge numbers

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.050
and in very sadistic manners.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:47.190
I'm not gonna read because
it's absolutely horrific,

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.100
and you wonder if there's like
a little bit of imagination

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.750
going on in these chronicles.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.360
This is the famous one
by Nathan of Hanover,

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.610
but let's just say it's gruesome,

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.450
and a colleague of mine, Adam Teller,

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:02.790
has found a Polish version of this

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.340
that seems to pretty much verify

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.050
that this kind of thing was happening.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.380
It's a furious massacre,

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:15.380
and if the Jewish population
pre-1648 was 40,000,

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.933
only about 21,000 seemed to survive.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.680
Many, 8,000, become refugees

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.720
and are wandering across Europe.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.300
1,000 convert to save their lives,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.480
and 3,000 are taken
captive mainly by Tatars

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.760
and sold in slave markets

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.670
in far-flung places in the Ottoman Empire,

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:38.700
often redeemed by the local
Jewish communities there,

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.210
and, you know, it's an absolute shock

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.183
to the Jewish sense of
security and stability.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.120
As a result, and I'm gonna finish here,

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.480
as a result, you know,

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.280
there's a kind of psychic trauma
to the Jewish collectivity

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.980
that makes it easier

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.750
for this false messiah,
Shabbetai Tzvi, to arise.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:04.890
You know, it's a little bit later,

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.690
but he bases his whole career

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.230
on vengeance for the 1648 massacres

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.360
and managed to convince
Jews all over the world

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.380
that he's the messiah,

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.230
and they follow him, and they
sell off their possessions,

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.810
and some move to the land of Israel

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.853
convinced that the Messiah has come,

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.600
but, you know, after that disappointment

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.910
and throughout this period, really,

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.500
Jewish communities managed

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.590
to reconstitute themselves very quickly.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.930
We know that from the number of houses.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.933
The Jewish population
continues to increase,

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:40.650
really significantly increase.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.360
How do we explain this

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.670
if it was such a devastating massacre?

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:48.660
It seems that the poor were
probably the main victims

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.970
because they have fewer means of fleeing,

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:54.033
you know, the Cossack armies.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.300
The wealthy are able to flee successfully,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.910
and they can come back and
reconstitute these towns,

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.910
and that seems to be what
happened in this case,

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.780
but look, this is a point in time

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.830
when the system broke down,
when it didn't really work,

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.520
but I just wanna end by saying

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.700
that the system really
worked most of the time,

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.040
that this was more the
exception than the rule.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.750
There was this kind of
economic-based symbiosis,

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.830
really based on a relationship
with the Polish nobility,

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.980
and it's really only with the
decline of the nobility itself

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.870
towards the end of the 19th century

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.030
that the system breaks down completely.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.150
That's when you're gonna
have the so-called pogroms,

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.950
these anti-Jewish riots,

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:44.040
you know, beginning the
1880s, and then 1903 to '06,

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.093
and the worst being in 1919
and during the Holocaust.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.570
This system usually worked

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.810
and usually kept Jewish
life in the Ukraine

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:55.830
and the rest of Eastern Europe

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:58.203
relatively secure and prosperous.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.642
Okay, thank you.

00:51:00.642 --> 00:51:03.642
(audience clapping)

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.537
(pensive music)

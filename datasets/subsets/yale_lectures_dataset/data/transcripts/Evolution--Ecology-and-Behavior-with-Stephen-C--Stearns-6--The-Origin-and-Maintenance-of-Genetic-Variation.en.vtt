00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.062
Prof: Okay,
today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:06.690
the origin and maintenance of
genetic variations;

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.313
and this is continuing our
discussion of central themes in

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.380
the mechanisms of
microevolution.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.876
The reason we're interested in
this is that there cannot be a

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:24.787
response to natural selection,
and there cannot be any history

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:27.463
recorded by drift,
unless there's genetic

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:29.300
variation in the population.
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.781
So we need to understand where
it, where it,

00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.830
comes from, and whether or not
it sticks around.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.705
If it happened to be the case
that every time a new mutation

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.530
popped up it was immediately
eliminated,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.820
either for reasons that were
random or selective,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.320
evolution couldn't occur.
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.910
If a lot of variation came into
the population,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.024
and then persisted for a
tremendously long time without

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.037
any sorting,
we would see patterns on the

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:02.335
face of the earth that are
totally different from what we

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:02.869
see today.
 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.444
So these issues are actually
central issues in the basic part

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:14.390
of evolutionary genetics that
makes a difference to evolution.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.370
So the context basically is
this.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.400
Since evolution is based on
genetic change,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.299
we need to know where genetic
differences come from;

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.861
and the rate of evolution
depends on the amount of genetic

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.860
variation that's available in
the population,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.739
so we need to know what
maintains the variation.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.250
If you were to go back fifty,
sixty years,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.129
which is what we now think of
as the classical view--

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:47.300
remember the classical view is
a moving window in time--

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.909
at that point it was thought
there wasn't very much genetic

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.518
variation out there and that
evolution was actually limited

00:01:56.518 --> 00:02:00.890
by the rate at which genetic
variation was created.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.140
Since 1965, with the discovery
of protein isozymes,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.882
and especially now,
since the discovery of ways to

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:16.038
sequence DNA very cheaply,
we know that's not true.

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:19.706
There is a tremendous amount of
genetic variation in Nature,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.938
and I'm going to show you some
of it this morning.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:30.060
So since about 1975,1980,
due to a series of studies,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.680
some of them on the Galapagos
finches,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.860
some of them on the guppies in
Trinidad,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.919
some of them on mosquitofish in
Hawaii,

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.012
some of them on the world's
fish populations responding to

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:41.834
being fished,
we know that evolution can be

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:45.473
very fast when there's strong
selection acting on large

00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:48.910
populations that have lots of
genetic variation.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.270
So really the rate of
evolution--and,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.132
for example,
the issue of climate change and

00:02:57.132 --> 00:03:00.723
global warming--
will all the species on earth

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:03.310
be able to adapt fast enough to
get--

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.379
to persist in the face of
anthropogenic change on the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.252
planet?--
that issue is directly

00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:11.479
addressed by the things we're
talking about this morning.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.389
If there isn't enough genetic
change to adapt,

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.280
say, the grassland populations
of the world,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.120
or things that are living on
mountains,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.425
to the kinds of climatic
changes that they are going to

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:26.199
be encountering,
and currently are encountering,

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.240
they'll go extinct.
 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.965
Ei--they have to either move to
a place which is like the one

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:34.567
they're in, or they have to
adapt to the changed conditions

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:36.430
that they're encountering.
 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.669
So the outline of the lecture
today basically is this.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:48.288
Mutations are the ultimate
origin of all genetic variation.

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:52.000
Recombination has a huge impact
on variation.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.095
So what that means basically is
that sexual populations have the

00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:59.085
potential to be much more
variable than asexual

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:02.175
populations--
there is lots of genetic

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.990
variation in natural
populations.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.354
And then we will run through
four mechanisms that can

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:10.878
maintain variations in single
genes,

00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:13.413
and briefly mention the
maintenance of variation in

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:14.530
quantitative traits.
 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.920
So mutations are where these
genetic differences come from,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.944
and they can be changes in the
DNA sequence or changes in the

00:04:27.944 --> 00:04:31.435
chromosomes,
and in the chromosomes they can

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:35.041
be changes in how many
chromosomes there are in the

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:39.440
form of chromosomes or in
aspects of chromosome structure.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.279
So there can be gene
duplications and so forth.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.141
Most of the mutations that
occur naturally are mutations

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.029
that are occurring during DNA
replication.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.519
For those of you who are
thinking of being doctors,

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.661
this is important because the
probability that a cancer will

00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:04.802
emerge in a tissue is directly
proportional to the number of

00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:07.470
times cells divide in that
tissue;

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.483
which is why cancers of
epithelial cells are much more

00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:15.269
common than cancers of cells
that do not divide.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:17.639
You never get a cancer in your
heart muscle,

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.550
and you frequently get cancers
on your skin,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.439
and in your lungs,
and in the lining of your gut,

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.985
and that's because every
mitotic event is a potential

00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:29.800
mutation event.
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.480
The kinds of DNA sequence
mutations are point mutations;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.478
there can be duplications,
and in the chromosomes as well

00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:44.529
there can be inversions and
transplacements that go on.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.399
Genes can be moved around from
one chromosome to another.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.812
They can actually be turned
around so that they are in the

00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:56.759
opposite reading direction,
along the chromosome.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.610
All those things are going on.
 

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:07.821
There's good reason to think
that an intermediate mutation

00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.649
rate is optimal.
 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:14.648
If the mutation rate is too
low, then the descendants of

00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:18.920
that gene cannot adapt to
changed conditions.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.550
If it's too high,
then all the accumulation of

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.550
information on what has worked
in the past will be destroyed by

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.899
mutation;
which is what happens to

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.850
pseudogenes that are not
expressed.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.009
So some intermediate rate is
probably optimal.

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.283
Now a gene that controls the
mutation rate will evolve much

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:45.968
more easily in an asexual
organism than in a sexual

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:49.949
species because sexual
recombination uncouples the gene

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.750
for the benefits of the process.
 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.329
Let me illustrate that.
 

00:06:55.329 --> 00:07:01.430
Suppose that I am engaged in a
process that Greg wants to

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.555
control,
and we've got a certain period

00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:09.211
of time we can do it in,
and so he decides that he's

00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:13.769
going to do it,
with me, on a bus going to New

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:14.540
York.
 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.961
We go down to the bus station
and, because of recombination,

00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.629
he gets into one bus and I get
into another.

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:24.432
He loses his opportunity to
control me, simply because I am

00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:26.528
now riding in a different bus.
 

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:29.360
That's the effect of
recombination on genes.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.262
Recombination,
instead of keeping me on the

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:36.411
same chromosome that Greg and I
were on, will actually end up

00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.970
putting me into a different
body.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.610
Okay?
 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.189
So in a sexual organism the
gene that's controlling the

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.437
mutation rate becomes
disassociated from the genes

00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:50.420
whose mutations it might try to
control,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.483
and therefore even though down
in my ride to New York I invent

00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:58.079
some kind of great process that
would benefit Greg,

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:02.038
he is now dissociated from it
and he doesn't get to benefit

00:08:02.038 --> 00:08:03.540
from my adaptations.
 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.021
So it is much more plausible
that we will see genes that are

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.851
controlling mutation rates
evolving in organisms like

00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:19.612
bacteria and viruses than it is
that we will see mutations that

00:08:19.612 --> 00:08:23.699
control mutation rates evolving
in us.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:28.125
There is some reason to think
that there is weak selection on

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:31.959
them, but it's not as strong as
it is in bacteria.

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.408
And in fact,
interestingly,

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:36.365
in bacteria you can do
experimental evolution and show

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:39.210
that the mutation rate will
evolve up or down,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.629
depending on the circumstances
that you put the bacteria under.

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:47.534
These are some representative
mutation rates,

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:50.970
and it's good to have some
general framework to think

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.480
about--how frequent is a
mutation?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.879
So the per nucleotide mutation
rate in RNA is about 10^(-5);

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:02.379
in DNA it's 10^(-9).
 

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:06.490
So if you start evolving in an
RNA world,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.798
and you want to lower the
mutation rate because your

00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:15.700
information is getting eroded
and you can somehow manage to

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.009
engineer DNA as your molecule
rather than RNA,

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:24.842
you can see that you would be
able to pick up four orders of

00:09:24.842 --> 00:09:26.808
magnitude by doing so.
 

00:09:26.808 --> 00:09:29.019
That's just because DNA is more
stable.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:32.139
DNA is a remarkably stable
molecule.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:35.908
It's possible to recover DNA
from fossil bones.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:39.585
Svante Paabo is in the middle
of a project to sequence

00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:41.178
Neanderthal's genome.
 

00:09:41.178 --> 00:09:44.889
He's already got significant
chunks of Neanderthal sequence.

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:49.470
So DNA is just a remarkably
stable molecule.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.062
The per gene rate of mutation
in DNA is about one in a

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:59.548
million;
so this is like per meiosis.

00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:06.080
The per trait mutation rate is
about 10^(-3) to 10^(-5).

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.184
The rate per prokaryotic genome
is about 10^(-3),

00:10:11.184 --> 00:10:16.610
and per eukaryotic genome it's
between .1 and 10.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.808
I once saw a really great talk
by a guy named Drake,

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:24.056
Frank Drake,
from NIH--this was like at a

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.591
big international meeting--
Drake walks up to the

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:30.519
blackboard and he writes 10^(-3)
on the blackboard;

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:33.840
he's going to give a talk about
mutation rates in prokaryotes.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.450
He talks for 45 minutes about
this number;

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.554
no PowerPoints,
nothing else,

00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:43.692
he's just speaking very
animatedly about how it was that

00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:47.376
just about all viruses and
bacteria appear to have

00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:52.038
converged on roughly this per
generation mutation rate,

00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:55.543
per genome, which is pretty
strong evidence that it's an

00:10:55.543 --> 00:10:58.403
optimal rate;
thousands of species have

00:10:58.403 --> 00:11:00.230
converged on this rate.
 

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.264
And I asked him how it was that
he gave this great talk without

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:05.245
any slides,
and he said that he had lost

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:09.591
them in the airplane,
and that had happened about ten

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:12.562
times before,
and it was such a great talk

00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:15.178
without the slides that he just
switched completely.

00:11:15.178 --> 00:11:17.778
So a couple of years ago,
actually early last year in

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:20.778
this course, I tried giving
talks without the PowerPoints.

00:11:20.778 --> 00:11:23.682
Ninety percent of the class
didn't like it and it ten

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.190
percent of the class did.
 

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.159
So that's why you're still
getting PowerPoints.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.039
Okay?
 

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:32.570
Now what is your mutation rate?
 

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:39.566
Well each of you has about four
mutations in you that your--new

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:46.224
things, your parents didn't
have, and about 1.6 of those are

00:11:46.224 --> 00:11:48.029
deleterious.
 

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:51.340
So this is something that's
always going on.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.519
And there are about 100 of us
in the room;

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.640
that means there are somewhere
around 150 new,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.971
deleterious mutations,
unique in this generation,

00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:02.330
sitting here in the classroom.
 

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.418
Where did they happen?
 

00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:09.559
Well they happened fifty times
more in males than in females.

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:17.200
And there are good biological
reasons why.

00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:23.453
There are many more cell
divisions between the formation

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:26.599
of a zygote and the production
of a sperm than there are

00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:29.857
between the formation of a
zygote and the production of an

00:12:29.857 --> 00:12:30.428
egg.
 

00:12:30.428 --> 00:12:32.950
In human development,
and in mammal development,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.129
egg production pretty much
stops in the third month of

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:40.057
embryonic development,
at which point all the women in

00:12:40.057 --> 00:12:44.519
this room had about seven
million eggs in their ovaries.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:49.854
Since then oocytic atresia,
which means the killing of

00:12:49.854 --> 00:12:56.092
oocytes, has reduced the number
of eggs in your ovaries down by

00:12:56.092 --> 00:12:58.610
nearly seven million.
 

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.558
When you began menstruating you
had about 1500 eggs in your

00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:03.240
ovaries.
 

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.370
You've gone from seven million
down to 1500.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.921
When you were born you had gone
from seven million down to one

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.486
million;
you'd lost six million of them

00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:12.418
before you were even born.
 

00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:15.840
It appears to be a quality
control mechanisms,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.096
ensuring that the oocytes that
survive are genetically in

00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:21.769
really good shape.
 

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:24.870
So there are very,
very different kinds of biology

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.720
affecting the production of eggs
and sperm;

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.120
females have a mutation screen
that males do not.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.707
Well the result of that is that
there are more mutations in the

00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:40.840
sperm of older males;
they've lived a longer time.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.115
Anybody that wants to get in to
mate choice and what kinds of

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:47.447
reproductive strategies should
result from this simple fact is

00:13:47.447 --> 00:13:51.309
welcome to write a paper on it;
there's literature out there.

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:51.899
Okay?
 

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:57.399
Not very PC,
but it's very biological.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:59.178
Okay, recombination.
 

00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:04.990
What does recombination do to
this mutational variation that

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.649
builds up in populations?
 

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:12.407
Suppose we had ten genes,
and each of those genes had two

00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:17.418
alleles, and each of those was
on a different chromosome.

00:14:17.418 --> 00:14:22.178
That would mean that just
looking at those ten genes,

00:14:22.178 --> 00:14:27.120
on those ten chromosomes,
we could get 3^(10) different

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.220
zygotes.
 

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.070
Can anybody tell me why?
 

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:45.850
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.460
Prof: How many genotypes
are there for the first gene?

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.340
How many different combinations
of Aa are there?

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.139
Three: AA, Aa, aa.
 

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:01.028
So there's three things that
the first gene can do.

00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:03.960
There are three things that the
second gene can do.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.029
There are three things that the
third gene can do.

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:06.889
And there are ten genes.
 

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:09.534
So we multiply them to get the
number of different

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.099
combinations,
and if they are independently

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:14.149
sorting on different
chromosomes,

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:17.928
that will result in 59,000
different zygotes.

00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:23.157
Now if we had a real eukaryotic
genome that had free

00:15:23.157 --> 00:15:26.244
recombination--
which we don't have--and

00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:30.004
unlimited crossing over--
which we don't have--then the

00:15:30.004 --> 00:15:35.009
number of possible zygotes is
about 3^(15,000) or 3^(50,000),

00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:38.918
somewhere along that,
that order of magnitude.

00:15:38.918 --> 00:15:42.893
Well the number of fundamental
particles in the universe is

00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:43.990
only 10^(131).
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.774
We're talking about numbers
which are just inconceivably

00:15:48.774 --> 00:15:49.470
large.
 

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.158
That means that in the entire
course of evolution the number

00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:58.687
of genetic possibilities that
are present, just sitting in

00:15:58.687 --> 00:16:01.389
you, have never been realized.
 

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:04.754
There is a huge portion of
genetic space that remains

00:16:04.754 --> 00:16:06.945
unexplored,
simply because there hasn't

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:09.851
been enough time on the planet
for that many organisms to have

00:16:09.851 --> 00:16:10.279
lived.
 

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:21.879
Now, how--you can see that this
would be free recombination with

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:25.129
independent assortment of
chromosomes.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.990
That makes it easier than if
it's crossing over,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.528
because crossing over happens
more frequently the farther

00:16:30.528 --> 00:16:33.813
genes are apart on a chromosome,
and it doesn't happen very

00:16:33.813 --> 00:16:35.259
often when they're close
together.

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:40.197
So there's been an evolution of
the chromosome number of a lot

00:16:40.197 --> 00:16:41.250
of species.
 

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.460
And I've previously told you
about ascaris.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:50.120
Ascaris is a nematode that
lives in the gut of vertebrates.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.774
There is an ascaris that lives
in dogs, there's an ascaris that

00:16:54.774 --> 00:16:58.230
lives in us, and it just has one
chromosome.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.580
So that's kind of one limit,
things with one chromosome.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.180
There are species that have
hundreds of chromosomes.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.452
Sugarcane has I think about 110
chromosomes, something like

00:17:11.452 --> 00:17:12.088
that.
 

00:17:12.088 --> 00:17:16.089
So the chromosome number of the
species itself evolves,

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.980
and it can evolve fairly
dynamically.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.709
There are actually some
populations within a single

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:24.819
species that have a different
chromosome number than other

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:28.582
populations within that species,
and when individuals from those

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:31.278
two populations meet and mate
with each other,

00:17:31.278 --> 00:17:35.750
the offspring often run into
developmental difficulties

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.890
because of this difference in
chromosome number.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.768
There is such a,
uh, contrast in house mice in

00:17:43.768 --> 00:17:44.630
Denmark.
 

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.047
There's a spot where there's
sort of a hybrid zone in

00:17:48.047 --> 00:17:50.583
Denmark,
and the house mice on one side

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.818
of the hybrid zone have
difficulty--

00:17:52.818 --> 00:17:55.233
uh, they're in the same
species, but they just have

00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:58.023
different chromosome numbers--
and they have difficulty

00:17:58.023 --> 00:18:01.085
dealing with the house mice on
the other side of that hybrid

00:18:01.085 --> 00:18:01.500
zone.
 

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.896
The difference in chromosome
numbers appears to have arisen

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:07.710
in the house mice during the
last glaciation,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.430
and they recolonized northern
Europe from different places.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.750
Some of them came up from Spain.
 

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.690
Some of them came up from
Greece.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.359
They got together in Denmark
and they ran into problems.

00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:28.358
Okay, now crossing over also
generates a lot of genetic

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.759
diversity.
 

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:33.910
And the amount of crossing over
can be adjusted.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.240
Inversions will block crossing
over.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.670
You take a chunk of chromosome
and flip it around,

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.714
so that in the middle of the
chromosome the gene sequences

00:18:42.714 --> 00:18:45.440
are reversed,
and in that section of the

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.538
chromosome the inversion causes
mechanical difficulties.

00:18:49.538 --> 00:18:52.984
It actually changes the shape
of the chromosomes when they

00:18:52.984 --> 00:18:56.371
line up next to each other,
and it inhibits crossing over

00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:57.519
during meiosis.
 

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:02.746
This is one way of taking a
bunch of genes that happen to

00:19:02.746 --> 00:19:07.598
have really helpful interactions
with each other,

00:19:07.598 --> 00:19:10.140
and locking them up in a
combination,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.960
so that they don't recombine.
 

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.373
That has happened,
and it's thought to be

00:19:17.373 --> 00:19:21.554
important in the evolution of
quite a few insects,

00:19:21.554 --> 00:19:22.920
for example.
 

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:29.233
Now we can play the mental game
of asking ourselves what would

00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:35.548
happen in a sexual population if
we just shut off mutation?

00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:37.118
We can't actually do it,
of course.

00:19:37.118 --> 00:19:40.423
But how long would it take
before we would even notice that

00:19:40.423 --> 00:19:44.445
evolution had been shut off,
if we were just observing the

00:19:44.445 --> 00:19:47.868
rate at which that population
was evolving?

00:19:47.868 --> 00:19:50.848
And the answer to that is kind
of interesting.

00:19:50.848 --> 00:19:55.336
We could wave a magic wand over
a moderately large sexual

00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:58.420
population,
completely shut off mutation,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.070
and the impact of recombination
on the standing genetic

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.127
diversity in that population
would create so many new diverse

00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:09.508
combinations of genes that it
would take about 1000

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:13.633
generations before we would even
notice that mutation has been

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:14.848
shut off.
 

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:16.940
So think back to the beginning
of the lecture.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.329
I said mutation is the origin
of all genetic diversity;

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:22.618
and that's true.
 

00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:26.538
But once mutation and evolution
have been going on for awhile,

00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:29.974
so much genetic diversity
builds up in populations that

00:20:29.974 --> 00:20:33.220
you can actually shut off
mutation and mutation--

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.240
and evolution will keep going
for quite a while.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.839
After 1000 generations it'll
run out of steam and stop;

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:44.150
but it takes quite awhile.
 

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.344
Okay, so where genetic
came--where genetic variation

00:20:47.344 --> 00:20:49.598
came from and how much there
was,

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:54.606
was a huge issue and caused a
lot of research and controversy

00:20:54.606 --> 00:20:56.608
for about fifty years.
 

00:20:56.608 --> 00:21:00.852
Before 1965,
there was the concept of a wild

00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:02.528
type out there.
 

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:06.067
After 1965--so there was one
really good genome,

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:08.930
and then there were a few
mutations.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.863
After 1965, with
electrophoresis,

00:21:11.863 --> 00:21:15.528
the impact of Clement Markert's
work,

00:21:15.528 --> 00:21:18.328
and Dick Lewontin,
and his colleague Hubby,

00:21:18.328 --> 00:21:22.019
we've recognized that there's a
lot of molecular variation.

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:27.905
This concept that each species
has a certain genomic type is no

00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:29.519
longer tenable.
 

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:32.974
There's just a tremendous
number of different kinds of

00:21:32.974 --> 00:21:34.279
genomes out there.
 

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:38.523
Since 1995, we've had a lot of
DNA sequence variation and now

00:21:38.523 --> 00:21:40.009
we've got genomics.
 

00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:42.790
So I want to illustrate the
impact of genomics with

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.073
something that's just become
possible in about the last four

00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:46.630
years.
 

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.894
The HapMap Project was done
after the human genome was

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:54.369
sequenced,
and the motivation of it was to

00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:58.759
try to associate diseases with
common genetic variants.

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:03.510
By the way, the upshot of that
effort is genes don't normally

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.313
account for very much,
usually about two or three

00:22:07.313 --> 00:22:11.278
percent of the variation;
but that's another story.

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:14.960
So basically once we had the
human genome,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.236
it was clear that we could then
look for places in genomes that

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:22.244
had single nucleotides,
that were different,

00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:25.916
between one person and another;
these are called single

00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:27.868
nucleotide polymorphisms.
 

00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:33.425
And to do this the HapMap
Project looked at regions of the

00:22:33.425 --> 00:22:38.299
human genome that were about
10,500 kilobytes long,

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:40.640
for 269 individuals.
 

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:48.450
So that's 10,500,000 bases,
for each of 269 individuals.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.281
And they did it on people from
Nigeria, Utah,

00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:52.568
Beijing and Tokyo.
 

00:22:52.568 --> 00:22:56.980
And they discovered that our
genome is arranged in blocks.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.491
There are, within each block,
within each let's say rarely

00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:09.185
recombining section of DNA,
there are about 30 to 70 single

00:23:09.185 --> 00:23:13.372
nucleotide polymorphisms,
and that means that you could

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:17.721
design a genechip just to pick
up enough of these to tag a

00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:21.460
person as having that particular
block of DNA.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.980
Okay?
 

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.332
So now there are these
genechips, and we've discovered

00:23:27.332 --> 00:23:32.259
that there are some SNPs that
are associated with disease.

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:35.077
We can see that there are
portions of the genome that show

00:23:35.077 --> 00:23:36.710
signatures of recent selection.
 

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.700
This is an interesting
literature.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:45.230
This is what a little section
of our chromosome 19 looks like.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.798
Okay?
 

00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:48.957
So this is the position along
the chromosome,

00:23:48.957 --> 00:23:52.832
starting at 40,000,000,
and going up to 50,000,000 base

00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:53.548
pairs.
 

00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:56.973
The little black dots are all
the genes that are in this

00:23:56.973 --> 00:24:01.166
section of the chromosome,
and using the single nucleotide

00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:04.997
polymorphisms,
you can identify people as

00:24:04.997 --> 00:24:11.490
having a segment of DNA that is
not recombining very frequently.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.571
And you will notice that they
are actually lined up right over

00:24:15.571 --> 00:24:19.118
places where the recombination
rate is pretty high.

00:24:19.118 --> 00:24:22.519
So you can see breaks in this
upper diagram here,

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:26.202
showing places where the
recombination rate is pretty

00:24:26.202 --> 00:24:26.838
high.
 

00:24:26.838 --> 00:24:30.465
So remember,
this was done over the entire

00:24:30.465 --> 00:24:33.650
genome, all of our 23
chromosomes.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.940
I am only showing you one tiny
part of one chromosome here,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.630
and there are actually 650,000
of those blocks that have been

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.568
identified now in our genome.
 

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:53.156
So three years later a group
then goes out and takes 928

00:24:53.156 --> 00:25:00.224
people, from 51 populations,
and looks at how much haplotype

00:25:00.224 --> 00:25:02.980
diversity there is.
 

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.711
Remember, a haplotype is a
block that's got some specific

00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:08.910
nucleotide polymorphisms on it.
 

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:14.180
The Y axis here has 650,000
entries on it.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.450
Of course they all blend
together, it's hard to see them.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:23.528
The X axis has 928 people
arranged across it.

00:25:23.528 --> 00:25:30.930
This is a sample of human
genetic diversity on the planet.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.009
You can see there's quite a bit.
 

00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:33.130
You can see different colors.
 

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.200
Okay?
 

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.342
Now if you take this and you
then use the tools of

00:25:38.342 --> 00:25:42.653
phylogenetic analysis to ask
what kind of historical

00:25:42.653 --> 00:25:46.119
structure is there in this data
set,

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.619
this is what you get.
 

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:51.430
You get a group in Africa.
 

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:56.460
You can see the emergence of
mankind from Africa--

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.361
this is thought to have
happened about 100,000 years

00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:01.491
ago--
and then you get a very,

00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:05.750
very nice genetic trace of our
expansion across the globe.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.580
We paused for awhile in the
Middle East, before we broke

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:08.890
out.
 

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.818
We were in the Middle East up
until about 50,000 years ago,

00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:15.880
and then there was a group that
went into Europe,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.759
and other groups then split off
from that and set off into Asia.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:25.394
And about probably 40,000 years
ago people went to Papua New

00:26:25.394 --> 00:26:30.911
Guinea and Australia,
and probably somewhere around

00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:35.670
between say 15 and 20,000 years
ago,

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.247
a group of people headed off
over the Bering Straight for

00:26:38.247 --> 00:26:41.179
North America,
to become Native Americans,

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:45.078
and then another group
diversified in East Asia.

00:26:45.078 --> 00:26:50.239
So there is a huge amount of
information in the history of

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:52.048
genetic variation.
 

00:26:52.048 --> 00:26:57.573
So what I'd now like to do is
give you four general reasons

00:26:57.573 --> 00:27:03.000
why this much genetic variation
could be maintained in any

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.430
population.
 

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.041
If you look in the textbook you
will see that there is also a

00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:11.653
tremendous amount of genetic
variation in wild populations of

00:27:11.653 --> 00:27:15.150
practically any species,
just as there is in humans.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.202
In humans it happens to be
better analyzed than in almost

00:27:19.202 --> 00:27:20.650
any other species.
 

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.075
But something like that can be
done for any species on earth

00:27:25.075 --> 00:27:29.423
now, and it's getting cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper to do

00:27:29.423 --> 00:27:29.950
so.
 

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:35.619
So selection and drift can both
explain the maintenance of

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:37.608
genetic variation.
 

00:27:37.608 --> 00:27:41.723
And for a long time there was a
fight within evolutionary

00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:45.838
genetics about whether what we
saw was being explained by

00:27:45.838 --> 00:27:47.529
selection or drift.
 

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:49.848
It appears not to be a
productive question.

00:27:49.848 --> 00:27:51.890
It's extremely difficult to
answer,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.938
in any specific case,
whether the pattern you see is

00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:58.284
because of a history of natural
selection or because of a

00:27:58.284 --> 00:27:59.538
history of drift.
 

00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:04.031
Both of them are capable of
generating quite a few patterns,

00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:06.240
and those patterns overlap.
 

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.586
So if you take a very specific
case and study it in detail,

00:28:10.586 --> 00:28:14.710
you can give a leading role to
selection or to drift.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.229
For example,
you can find a signature of

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:20.328
selection in a portion of a
human chromosome,

00:28:20.328 --> 00:28:23.401
indicating that there's a gene
there that perhaps was affected

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:26.078
by a specific disease;
that's been done.

00:28:26.078 --> 00:28:31.615
But the general answer,
for all species across the

00:28:31.615 --> 00:28:38.166
planet, about whether selection
or drift is more important,

00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:41.328
probably is unrealistic.
 

00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:45.577
It's probably not a fruitful
research effort to try to answer

00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:46.710
this question.
 

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.481
So here are the situations that
can maintain genetic variation

00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:52.578
in principle;
there are four of them.

00:28:52.578 --> 00:28:54.910
There can be a balance between
mutation and drift;

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.130
a balance between mutation and
selection;

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.160
there can be heterosis or
over-dominance;

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.750
and there can be negative
frequency dependence.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.381
So I'm going to step through
these now and give you some

00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:09.880
feeling for how the thinking
works on each of them.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.707
In so doing,
we're going to be dealing with

00:29:12.707 --> 00:29:16.682
equilibria,
and really there are other ways

00:29:16.682 --> 00:29:21.154
of approaching the analysis,
but the equilibrium approach is

00:29:21.154 --> 00:29:23.730
the one that allows you do it
with simple algebra,

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.470
rather than with complicated
computer models.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.269
We do it for mathematical
convenience.

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:33.536
We do it also because the
periods during which things are

00:29:33.536 --> 00:29:37.295
in balance may be pretty long,
compared to those in which

00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:40.383
they're dynamically changing--
that does appear to be a

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:43.365
message of evolution--
but with respect to this

00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:46.256
particular question of the
maintenance of genetic

00:29:46.256 --> 00:29:49.739
variation,
we don't really know too much

00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:51.650
about those periods.
 

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.932
Selection can go back and forth;
populations can appear to be in

00:29:55.932 --> 00:29:59.019
stasis when things are going on
inside of them.

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:01.818
This question is really
unresolved.

00:30:01.818 --> 00:30:06.117
We do know that in terms of our
immune genes that we share

00:30:06.117 --> 00:30:09.210
certain polymorphisms with
chimpanzees.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.192
Those appear to have been
things that evolved in terms of

00:30:13.192 --> 00:30:16.963
disease resistance before humans
and chimps speciated,

00:30:16.963 --> 00:30:19.808
about five to six million years
ago.

00:30:19.808 --> 00:30:23.362
So certainly that genetic
variation is five to six million

00:30:23.362 --> 00:30:24.108
years old.
 

00:30:24.108 --> 00:30:27.792
We don't have too many cases
where we know that,

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:32.339
but there may be many more out
there, just undiscovered.

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:37.108
A little terminology.
 

00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:42.654
The fixation probability of a
mutation is the probability that

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:47.019
it will spread and be fixed in
the population.

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:50.269
That's equal to its frequency,
at any point in time.

00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:53.820
The fixation time is how long
it takes to become fixed in

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.710
generations.
 

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.099
And I put these ideas up on the
board earlier,

00:30:58.099 --> 00:31:02.318
and I'd like to go back to
that, because I'd like to have

00:31:02.318 --> 00:31:04.730
reference to it in a minute.
 

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.352
So if this is frequency here,
it can go from 0 to 1,

00:31:09.352 --> 00:31:12.432
on the Y axis,
and if this is time,

00:31:12.432 --> 00:31:17.598
over here, this can be many
thousands of generations.

00:31:17.598 --> 00:31:20.951
And the fate of most neutral
alleles, when they come into the

00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:24.414
population, will be to increase
in frequency for a little while

00:31:24.414 --> 00:31:25.700
and then drift out.
 

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.380
They have low probability of
being fixed because when they

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.769
first originate they're very
rare,

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:38.723
and the probability of eventual
fixation is just directly equal

00:31:38.723 --> 00:31:41.078
to their frequency.
 

00:31:41.078 --> 00:31:43.720
So in a big population most
mutations disappear.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.270
But every once in awhile one
will drift through,

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.920
and when it reaches frequency
1.0, it's fixed.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.058
Okay?
 

00:31:54.058 --> 00:31:58.186
So the fixation probability is
the probability that out of all

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:02.112
of the mutations that might
arise, most of which drift out,

00:32:02.112 --> 00:32:06.858
this one will be fixed;
and that's a small number.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:10.884
And the fixation time,
how long it takes to be fixed,

00:32:10.884 --> 00:32:15.528
is on average how long it takes
for this process to occur.

00:32:15.528 --> 00:32:20.459
So that's the fixation time,
and that's an average of many

00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:21.670
such events.
 

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:28.053
So this picture that you're
looking at on the blackboard is

00:32:28.053 --> 00:32:33.227
really just supposed to be an
evocative picture,

00:32:33.227 --> 00:32:38.180
not some kind of precise,
concrete state.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.566
Because it's representing many,
many different genes,

00:32:40.566 --> 00:32:43.365
they are occurring at all the
different possible places in the

00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:43.869
genome.
 

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:51.102
Now for a neutral allele,
like the one that I've been

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:54.827
sketching there,
the fixation rate is just equal

00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:56.808
to the mutation rate.
 

00:32:56.808 --> 00:33:00.528
That doesn't depend on
population size.

00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:03.105
The probability of fixation,
as I said, is equal to the

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:04.058
current frequency.
 

00:33:04.058 --> 00:33:08.682
For a new mutation,
one of these guys down here,

00:33:08.682 --> 00:33:12.124
right at the beginning,
that's 1/2N,

00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:15.960
to be fixed,
and 1-1/2N to be lost.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.890
That means that most of them
are lost.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.109
N is the population size.
 

00:33:19.109 --> 00:33:20.410
N is a big number.
 

00:33:25.338 --> 00:33:28.440
Because there are 2N copies of
the gene in the population,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.900
and if mu is mutation rate,
that means in each generation

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.092
there are 2mu new mutations,
and for each of them the

00:33:37.092 --> 00:33:39.460
probability of fixation is 1/2N.
 

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.498
So the rate of fixation of new
mutations is about 2mu times

00:33:45.498 --> 00:33:50.078
1/2N, which is equal to the
mutation rate.

00:33:50.078 --> 00:33:53.970
That's about 10^(-5) to 10^(-6)
per gene,

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:58.477
and that means the molecular
clock is ticking once every

00:33:58.477 --> 00:34:03.640
100,000 to once every 1,000,000
generations per neutral gene.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.789
The fixation rate doesn't
depend on the population size,

00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:19.050
and that's because the
probability that a mutation will

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.469
occur in a population depends
upon how many organisms are

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:24.260
there.
 

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.193
You can think of all of their
genomes out there as being a net

00:34:27.193 --> 00:34:29.969
spread out to catch mutations--
the bigger then net,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.119
the more the mutations are in
any given generation--

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:38.597
and that will just exactly
compensate for the fact that it

00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:41.768
takes them longer to get fixed.
 

00:34:41.768 --> 00:34:45.070
The bigger the population,
the longer this process takes.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.271
But the bigger the population,
the more of these are actually

00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:49.820
moving through to fixation.
 

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.539
Those two things exactly
compensate.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.550
Okay?
 

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.300
In a small population most of
them are lost.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.373
The few that do reach fixation,
reach it rapidly,

00:35:03.373 --> 00:35:06.768
and in large populations more
new mutations are fixed,

00:35:06.768 --> 00:35:09.139
but each one does it more
slowly.

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:12.311
Those things compensate,
and the fixation rate doesn't

00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:15.661
depend on population size,
if you're looking at the whole

00:35:15.661 --> 00:35:16.320
genome.
 

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.507
The number of differences fixed
over the whole genome doesn't

00:35:19.507 --> 00:35:21.579
depend on the size of the
population.

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:26.771
Now there is a technical
concept in evolutionary genetics

00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:30.760
called effective population
size,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.460
and that is the size of a
random mating population,

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.972
that is not changing in time,
whose genetic dynamic would

00:35:37.972 --> 00:35:41.110
match those of the real one
under consideration.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.326
And so we know that there are
lots of violations of these

00:35:44.326 --> 00:35:45.130
assumptions.
 

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:45.679
Okay?
 

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:47.210
Populations don't have random
mating.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.250
They are changing in time;
ta-da ta-da.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.291
How do we take a real
population and then transform it

00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:58.030
into something that's really
easy to calculate?

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.230
Well, there are methods of
doing so.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.295
The factors that will have to
come into consideration are

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:07.463
variation in family size,
inbreeding, variation in

00:36:07.463 --> 00:36:10.878
population size,
and variation in the number of

00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:12.849
each sex that is breeding.
 

00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:17.072
And so just to illustrate one
of these, to give you some idea

00:36:17.072 --> 00:36:19.675
of its impact,
look at cattle in North

00:36:19.675 --> 00:36:20.518
America.
 

00:36:20.518 --> 00:36:27.869
There are about 100,000,000
female cattle in North America.

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:32.255
They are fertilized by four
males, on average,

00:36:32.255 --> 00:36:35.570
through artificial
insemination.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.925
So there are four bulls that
are inseminating 100,000,000

00:36:39.925 --> 00:36:40.469
cows.
 

00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:42.949
Genetically speaking,
how big is the population?

00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:46.789
It's just about 16.
 

00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:47.550
Okay?
 

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.641
So by restricting one sex to a
very small number,

00:36:51.641 --> 00:36:56.927
we have restricted one pathway
that the genes can go through to

00:36:56.927 --> 00:36:59.570
get to the next generation.
 

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:04.802
And by making the male side of
it so small, we have biased the

00:37:04.802 --> 00:37:10.208
probability that a gene will get
fixed according to some process

00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:11.409
like this.
 

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:15.030
That male side is a really
small population.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.688
So it completely outweighs the
fact that there are 100,000,000

00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:20.909
females there.
 

00:37:20.909 --> 00:37:24.235
Because if you think about it,
every time one of those genes

00:37:24.235 --> 00:37:27.505
goes through a female and goes
into a baby and grows up the

00:37:27.505 --> 00:37:30.226
next generation,
it's going to go back through

00:37:30.226 --> 00:37:32.030
the male side of the
population--

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.719
right?--as you go through the
generations.

00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:39.804
And these formulas that have
been developed give us the

00:37:39.804 --> 00:37:44.570
opportunity to take that complex
situation and make a quick,

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:49.349
useful, back of the envelope
calculation of how we can expect

00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:53.969
genetic drift to be going on in
cattle in North America.

00:37:53.969 --> 00:37:57.659
Basically they are a small
population.

00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:05.219
So that's the basis of a
mutation-drift balance.

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:08.324
The amount of genetic variation
in a population,

00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:12.222
in a mutation-drift balance,
is just a snapshot of the genes

00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:14.268
that are moving through it.
 

00:38:14.268 --> 00:38:15.969
If I were to go back to this
diagram,

00:38:15.969 --> 00:38:19.768
and I were to put more genes
into this process,

00:38:19.768 --> 00:38:25.481
and I were to ask you to go out
and take a sample out of a

00:38:25.481 --> 00:38:30.320
population at any given time,
you would take the sample at

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.050
some time and you would tell me
that's how many genes we have,

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:35.710
that's how many are moving
through.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.800
Okay?
 

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.369
Now the second possibility for
a mechanism that will maintain

00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:47.179
genetic variation is a balance
between mutation and selection.

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:49.579
Mutation brings things into the
population.

00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:51.289
Selection takes them out.
 

00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:58.666
So if we had a haploid
population, with N individuals,

00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:03.016
and we have a mutation rate mu,
we're getting Nmu new mutations

00:39:03.016 --> 00:39:04.420
each generation.
 

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.172
The key idea is that if there
is a mutation selection balance,

00:39:10.172 --> 00:39:15.360
then the number going in equals
the number going out;

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.646
that's what would keep this
mechanism balancing the amount

00:39:19.646 --> 00:39:22.730
of genetic variation in the
population.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:27.286
And so if the mutant
individuals have a lower fitness

00:39:27.286 --> 00:39:31.010
than the non-mutants,
and if q is the frequency of

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.905
the mutants,
then selection is taking out

00:39:33.905 --> 00:39:35.989
NSq mutants per generation.
 

00:39:35.989 --> 00:39:39.126
And at equilibrium,
with the number coming in equal

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:42.530
to the number going out,
the number coming in equals the

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.697
number going out,
and that gives us an

00:39:44.697 --> 00:39:47.831
equilibrium frequency of the
mutation rate divided by the

00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:49.230
selection coefficient.
 

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.500
It's a very simple result.
 

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.289
And if you do the same kind of
thinking for a diploid

00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:58.503
population,
you get that the equilibrium

00:39:58.503 --> 00:40:03.518
frequency will be the square
root of the mutation rate,

00:40:03.518 --> 00:40:05.380
divided by selection for
recessives,

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.420
and the same as it is for
haploids for dominance.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.719
Okay?
 

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:14.230
So there are some examples of
this.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.853
There are rare human genetic
diseases, such as

00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:19.769
phenylketonuria--that's the
inability to metabolize

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:20.820
phenylalanine.
 

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.126
It has a frequency of about 1
in 200,000, in Caucasians and

00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:25.869
Chinese.
 

00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:29.320
It is probably in selection
mutation balance.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.840
It's at low frequency but it's
present in a population.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.550
People with it suffer a
selective disadvantage.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.637
It keeps mutating and coming
back in, and it keeps getting

00:40:38.637 --> 00:40:39.449
selected out.
 

00:40:39.449 --> 00:40:43.139
The result is balance,
okay, and it's pretty rare.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.565
The third mechanism that will
maintain selection in natural

00:40:50.565 --> 00:40:53.768
populations is a balance of
selective forces;

00:40:53.768 --> 00:40:56.666
that is, where the heterozygote
is better than either

00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:57.389
homozygote.
 

00:40:57.389 --> 00:41:00.280
And there is a classic,
famous case,

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.989
and it's always discussed in
this context,

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:06.375
and it's interesting that it's
the one that's always discussed

00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:08.978
in this context,
and the answer is it's been

00:41:08.978 --> 00:41:10.070
hard to find more.
 

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.139
&gt;
 

00:41:11.139 --> 00:41:12.070
Okay?
 

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.789
That's sickle cell anemia.
 

00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:19.342
Now this is the normal
heterozygote which is

00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:22.570
susceptible to malaria.
 

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:27.936
The heterozygote is resistant
to malaria, and the sickle cell

00:41:27.936 --> 00:41:30.800
homozygote is anemic and sick.
 

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.460
And it sets up this kind of
relative fitness.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.117
And, in fact,
if--H here is actually going to

00:41:41.117 --> 00:41:43.030
be a negative number.
 

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.630
Okay?
 

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.574
So the fitness of the
heterozygote is going to be

00:41:46.574 --> 00:41:49.460
higher than the fitness of
either homozygote.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.471
And you can then set--the
equilibrium frequency is going

00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:58.480
to be the one where P prime is
equal to p;

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.052
in other words,
the frequency in the next

00:42:00.052 --> 00:42:02.059
generation is just the same as
the frequency in this

00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:02.650
generation.
 

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.900
At what frequency does that
happen?

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:10.329
Well it happens when these
little equations are satisfied.

00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:12.152
And the interesting thing,
when you look at them,

00:42:12.152 --> 00:42:14.088
is that the selection
coefficient has dropped out of

00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:14.429
them.
 

00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:18.358
The equilibrium frequency
doesn't depend on the selection

00:42:18.358 --> 00:42:22.496
pressure, it depends on how
frequently the gene is expressed

00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.039
in a heterozygote.
 

00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:28.809
So it depends really on the
heterozygote advantage.

00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:32.159
Now the real situation is more
complicated than this.

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:34.230
There are several such sickle
alleles.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.809
They're changing frequency.
 

00:42:35.809 --> 00:42:39.672
The equilibrium assumption
doesn't really apply out there

00:42:39.672 --> 00:42:42.369
in Nature,
but it does give us a rough

00:42:42.369 --> 00:42:44.969
rule of thumb for how much to
expect,

00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:50.559
and as soon as people who have
sickle cell anemia move out of

00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:55.617
areas with malaria,
it takes quite awhile for that

00:42:55.617 --> 00:42:59.730
allele to disappear from the
population.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:04.760
The fourth mechanism is a
balance of selection forces,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:13.530
so that, for example,
for A2, when A2 is 0,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.795
it has high fitness here,
and as it increases in

00:43:16.795 --> 00:43:21.940
frequency its fitness drops,
according to this equation.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.269
Now the frequencies of A1 are
just reversed along this axis.

00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:30.230
A1 is 1.0 here, and it's 0 here.
 

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.250
A1 has low frequency--has low
fitness when it's at high

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.750
frequency, and high fitness at
low frequency.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.780
A2 has high fitness at low
frequency;

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.380
low fitness at high frequency.
 

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.590
So both of them do better when
they are rare.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.547
And I think that you can see
intuitively from this diagram

00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:57.155
that at equilibrium they will
stop changing when their

00:43:57.155 --> 00:44:00.199
fitnesses are exactly the same.
 

00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:04.079
Now there are some interesting
examples of this sort of thing.

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:07.967
One is Ronald Fisher's
classical argument on why 50:50

00:44:07.967 --> 00:44:12.121
sex ratios are so common;
why in many populations we see

00:44:12.121 --> 00:44:14.219
half females and half males.
 

00:44:14.219 --> 00:44:17.300
The deviations from that are
interesting.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.063
This kind of thing happens with
evolutionary stable strategies,

00:44:21.063 --> 00:44:24.039
and those are the solution to
many problems within

00:44:24.039 --> 00:44:25.800
evolutionary game theory.
 

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.239
They are also called Nash
equilibria, under certain

00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:31.922
circumstances,
and they are important in

00:44:31.922 --> 00:44:34.949
economics and political science
as well.

00:44:34.949 --> 00:44:39.983
And the tremendous amount of
genetic variation in the immune

00:44:39.983 --> 00:44:45.105
system is thought to exist for
reasons of frequency dependent

00:44:45.105 --> 00:44:48.496
selection;
basically pathogen resistant

00:44:48.496 --> 00:44:53.204
genes gain advantage when they
are rare, because when they're

00:44:53.204 --> 00:44:56.500
common, the pathogens evolve
onto them.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.510
They are more or less sitting
ducks;

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:01.030
they're a stable evolutionary
target.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.360
But as they become more common
and more and more pathogens

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.342
evolve onto them,
and those organisms get sicker

00:45:07.342 --> 00:45:10.003
and sicker,
the ones that are rare have an

00:45:10.003 --> 00:45:10.690
advantage.
 

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.773
And then as they start to
increase in frequency,

00:45:13.773 --> 00:45:16.777
the same process occurs;
the same process,

00:45:16.777 --> 00:45:20.418
it continues again,
and after awhile you've got

00:45:20.418 --> 00:45:23.717
hundreds of genes,
each of which is advantageous

00:45:23.717 --> 00:45:26.304
at low frequency,
and none of which are

00:45:26.304 --> 00:45:28.460
advantageous at high frequency.
 

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.976
So this is a very important
kind of mechanism maintaining

00:45:32.976 --> 00:45:37.980
genetic variation in natural
populations, including our own.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:43.070
If we look at quantitative
traits, such as birth

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:47.079
weight--here's a classical
example.

00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:51.807
This is for babies born in the
United States in the 1950s and

00:45:51.807 --> 00:45:55.985
1960s, and this is the percent
mortality for babies of

00:45:55.985 --> 00:45:57.719
different weights.
 

00:45:57.719 --> 00:46:00.864
You can see that there's
stabilizing selection that's

00:46:00.864 --> 00:46:04.431
operating to stabilize birth
weight right at about 7 pounds,

00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:06.610
and there's variation around
it.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.045
And you might wonder,
why is there any variation

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:11.070
around that?
 

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.900
Why don't all babies have the
optimal birth weight?

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.340
It's such an important thing.
 

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.150
And there are really two
answers to that.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.003
One is that there are
evolutionary conflicts of

00:46:21.003 --> 00:46:23.360
interest between mother and
infant,

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.628
and father and mother,
over how much should be

00:46:25.628 --> 00:46:28.713
invested in the infant,
and these lead to some

00:46:28.713 --> 00:46:29.599
variation.
 

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:33.630
And there's mutation selection
balance.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.777
So that this is a trait which
is probably determined by

00:46:37.777 --> 00:46:40.655
hundreds of genes,
and at each of those genes

00:46:40.655 --> 00:46:42.750
mutations are coming into the
population,

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.615
and at each of those genes
there is a mutation selection

00:46:45.615 --> 00:46:47.590
balance,
and when you add that up,

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:50.628
over hundreds of genes,
you get quite a range of

00:46:50.628 --> 00:46:51.380
variation.
 

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.724
Of course, some of this
variation is also due to

00:46:53.724 --> 00:46:55.869
developmental effects of the
environment;

00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:59.827
variations in the mother's diet
and other parts of her

00:46:59.827 --> 00:47:03.039
physiological condition during
pregnancy.

00:47:03.039 --> 00:47:05.869
So to summarize.
 

00:47:05.869 --> 00:47:09.067
The origin and maintenance of
genetic variation are key

00:47:09.067 --> 00:47:11.869
issues;
mutations are the origin.

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:13.760
Recombination has huge impact.
 

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.255
There's a tremendous amount of
genetic variation in natural

00:47:17.255 --> 00:47:18.099
populations.
 

00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:20.289
Remember that data from the
HapMap Project on us,

00:47:20.289 --> 00:47:24.550
on humans, and that all of the
differences that you have,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.449
in single nucleotide
polymorphisms,

00:47:26.449 --> 00:47:28.349
from the person sitting next to
you,

00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:32.465
and how you share them with
people who have had a similar

00:47:32.465 --> 00:47:35.260
history since we came out of
Africa.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.811
We can explain the maintenance
of this variation by various

00:47:38.811 --> 00:47:42.246
kinds of mechanisms,
principally for balance between

00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:45.713
mutation and drift,
between mutation and selection,

00:47:45.713 --> 00:47:48.550
and by some kind of balancing
selection,

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.909
either heterosis or frequency
dependent selection.

00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:55.940
And we think that variation in
many quantitative traits--

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.199
human birth weight,
human body size,

00:47:58.199 --> 00:48:02.760
athletic performance,
lots of other things--

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.050
is probably maintained by
mutation selection balance,

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.429
as well as by other factors.
 

00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:13.306
So next time I'm going to talk
about the role of development in

00:48:13.306 --> 00:48:14.250
evolution.

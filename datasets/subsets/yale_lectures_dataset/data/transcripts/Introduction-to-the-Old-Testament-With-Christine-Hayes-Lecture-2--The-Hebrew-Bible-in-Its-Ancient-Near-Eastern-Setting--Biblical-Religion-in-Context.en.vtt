00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.458
Professor Christine
Hayes: I mentioned in the

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:06.908
opening lecture that this course
is going to examine the biblical

00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:09.873
corpus from a variety of
different viewpoints and take a

00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:12.190
variety of approaches,
historical, literary,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.700
religious, cultural.
 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.702
And today we are going to begin
our appraisal of the first

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:21.424
portion of the Bible as the
product of a religious and

00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:23.110
cultural revolution.
 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.131
The Bible is the product of
minds that were exposed to and

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.365
influenced by and reacting to
the ideas and cultures of their

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.571
day.
And as I suggested in the

00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:36.197
opening lecture,
comparative study of the

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:40.137
literature of the Ancient Near
East and the Bible reveals the

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:43.945
shared cultural and literary
heritage at the same time that

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:47.360
it reveals great differences
between the two.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.011
In the literature of the Bible
some members of Israelite

00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:54.331
society--probably a cultural
religious and literary

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.580
elite--broke radically with the
prevailing norms of the day.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.799
They mounted a critique of
prevailing norms.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.678
The persons responsible for the
final editing and shaping of the

00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:09.064
Bible, somewhere from the
seventh to the fifth or fourth

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:12.757
century BCE--we're not totally
sure and we'll talk more about

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:16.390
that--those final editors were
members of this group.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.571
And they had a specific
worldview and they imposed that

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:22.694
worldview on the older
traditions and stories that are

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.049
found in the Bible.
 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.590
That radical new worldview in
the Bible was monotheism.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.812
But why, you might ask,
should the idea of one God

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:36.570
instead of many be so radical?
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.810
What is so different?
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.479
What's different about having
one God, from having a pantheon

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.620
of gods headed by a superior
god?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.170
What is so new and
revolutionary about monotheism?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.749
Well according to one school of
thought there isn't anything

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.760
particularly revolutionary about
monotheism;

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.507
and the classical account of
the rise of monotheism,

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:57.769
that has prevailed for a very
long time,

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:01.107
runs as follows,
and I have a little flow chart

00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:03.430
here to illustrate it for you.
 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.666
The argument goes that in every
society there's a natural

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.729
progression: a natural
progression from polytheism,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.225
which is the belief in many
gods--usually these are

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.419
personifications of natural
forces--to henotheism--"heno,"

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.514
equals one, god--or monolatry,
which is really the worship of

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:24.039
one god as supreme over other
gods,

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.749
so not denying the existence of
the other gods,

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.048
ascribing reality to them,
but isolating one as a supreme

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.840
god,
and onto monotheism,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.000
where essentially one believes
only in the reality of one god.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.134
And in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries this

00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:41.580
progression was viewed as an
advance,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.290
which is not very surprising
because the whole theory was put

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.080
forward by scholars who were
basically western monotheists.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.126
And these scholars maintained
that certain elements of

00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.770
biblical religion represented
pure religion,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.502
religion evolved to its highest
form, no longer tainted by pagan

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:06.009
and polytheistic elements of
Canaanite religion generally.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.139
So applying an evolutionary
model to religion carried with

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.530
it a very clear value judgment.
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.430
Polytheism was understood as
clearly inferior and primitive.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.490
Monolatry was an improvement.
 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.190
It was getting better.
 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.830
It was getting closer.
 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.024
But monotheism was judged to be
the best and purest form of

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.189
religion.
And at first the great

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.985
archeological discoveries that I
talked about last time in the

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:33.222
nineteenth century seemed to
support this claim--that

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:36.769
Israelite monotheism had evolved
from Ancient Near Eastern

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.436
polytheism.
Cuneiform tablets that were

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:42.301
inscribed with the great
literature of Mesopotamian

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.852
civilizations were uncovered and
when they were deciphered they

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:48.660
shed astonishing light on
biblical religion.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.832
And these discoveries led to a
kind of "parallelomania"--that's

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.930
how it's referred to in the
literature.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.127
Scholars delighted in pointing
out all of the parallels in

00:03:57.127 --> 00:04:00.325
theme and language and plot and
structure between biblical

00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:02.849
stories and Ancient Near Eastern
stories.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.199
So more than a thousand years
before the Israelite legend of

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.037
Noah and the ark you have
Mesopotamians telling the

00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:12.103
stories Ziusudra,
or in some versions Utnapishtim

00:04:12.103 --> 00:04:15.488
who also survived a great flood
by building an ark on the

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:18.423
instruction of a deity,
and the flood destroys all

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:21.360
life, and he sends out birds to
scout out the dry land,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.109
and so on.
So with parallels like these,

00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:26.780
it was argued,
it was clear that the religion

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.360
of the Israelites was not so
different from the religions of

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.970
their polytheistic or pagan
neighbors.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.670
They also had a creation story.
 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.210
They had a flood story.
 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.960
They did animal sacrifices.
 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.060
They observed purity taboos.
 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.378
Israelite religion was another
Ancient Near Eastern religion

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:46.640
and they differed from their
neighbors only over the number

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.889
of gods they worshiped:
one or many.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.237
It was just a more refined,
more highly evolved,

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:55.300
version of Ancient Near Eastern
religion.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.283
Well, this view,
this evolutionary view,

00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:02.185
or evolutionary model,
was challenged by man a named

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:04.939
Yehezkel Kaufmann in the 1930's.
 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.665
And Kaufman argued that
monotheism does not and cannot

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:12.882
evolve from polytheism because
the two are based on radically

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:16.786
divergent worldviews,
radically divergent intuitions

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:19.984
about reality.
And in a multivolume work which

00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:23.410
was later translated and
abridged, and you've got a

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.180
selection of reading from the
translated abridgment,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.750
so it's translated by Moshe
Greenburg, an abridged version

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.258
of his massive work The
Religion of Israel Kaufman

00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:37.389
asserted that the monotheism of
Israel wasn't,

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.225
it couldn't be,
the natural outgrowth of the

00:05:40.225 --> 00:05:42.270
polytheism of an earlier age.
 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.680
It was a radical break with it.
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.209
It was a total cultural and
religious discontinuity.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:50.697
It was a polemic against
polytheism and the pagan

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:52.547
worldview.
That's implicit,

00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:54.930
he says, throughout the
biblical text.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.490
It's been said that Kaufman
replaces the evolutionary model

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.769
with a revolutionary model.
 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.420
This was a revolution not an
evolution.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.453
Now one advantage of Kaufman's
model is that we can avoid some

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:16.290
of the pejorative evaluations of
polytheism as primitive,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.050
as necessarily earlier and
primitive and inferior.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.967
We're simply positing the
existence of two distinct

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.360
orientations,
two divergent worldviews.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.965
They each have their
explanatory merits and they each

00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:30.370
have their specific problems and
difficulties.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.530
It's not to say that Kaufman
wasn't clearly judgmental but at

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.743
least the potential is there for
us to understand these as two

00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:38.971
distinct systems,
each again, as I say,

00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:40.519
with its explanatory merits.
 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:44.429
But as we'll see some of the
things that monotheism solves

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:48.338
only invite other sorts of
problems that it has to wrestle

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:50.670
with throughout its long life.
 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.976
Now in Kaufman's view the
similarities,

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:55.950
therefore, between the
Israelites and Ancient Near

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.349
Eastern religion and cultures
that everyone was so busily

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.637
finding and celebrating,
these were in the end

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:05.641
similarities in form and
external structure,

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.117
appearance.
They weren't essential

00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:10.730
similarities.
They differed in content.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.569
Sure they both have animal
sacrifice.

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.639
Sure they both have ritual
purity laws.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.129
Sure they share certain stories
and legends.

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.495
But these have been adopted by
the Israelites and transformed,

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:25.717
transformed into vehicles that
convey the basic ideas of the

00:07:25.717 --> 00:07:27.649
monotheistic worldview.
 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:31.850
So a similarity in form doesn't
mean a similarity in function;

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.181
and in this,
Kaufman is anticipating

00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:36.579
arguments made by
anthropologists.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.103
The ritual cult of the
Israelites may look like that of

00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:41.579
their neighbors but it
functioned very differently;

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:45.424
its purpose was drastically
different from that of Israel's

00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:47.326
neighbors.
The Israelites like their

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:49.540
neighbors may have set up a king
over themselves.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.647
But Israelite monarchy differed
from Canaanite monarchy in

00:07:52.647 --> 00:07:55.209
significant ways because of
their monotheism.

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:57.569
These are all things we will
test and explore.

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.472
So the meaning and function of
Israel's cult,

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:03.573
of Israel's king,
of its creation stories or any

00:08:03.573 --> 00:08:07.465
of its other narratives--they
derive from the place of those

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:11.688
items within the larger cultural
framework or worldview of Israel

00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:15.184
and that larger framework or
worldview is one of basic

00:08:15.184 --> 00:08:18.529
monotheism.
So let's turn then to Kaufman's

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:21.880
description of the fundamental
distinction between the

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.421
polytheistic worldview and the
revolutionary monotheistic

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.949
worldview that took root in
Israel.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:31.268
And I am going to be rehearsing
and then critiquing the

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:34.525
arguments that are in that
hundred-page reading that I

00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:36.429
assigned for you this week.
 

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.859
This is the only time something
like this will happen in the

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:40.509
course.
And I do that because these

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:43.398
ideas are so fundamental and we
are going to be wrestling with

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.343
them throughout the course,
so it's important to me that

00:08:46.343 --> 00:08:49.827
you absorb this stuff right from
the beginning and think about it

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:51.950
and be critical of it and engage
it.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.509
Kaufman's ideas are very
important.

00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:56.546
They're also overstated in some
ways and that's why we're going

00:08:56.546 --> 00:08:59.191
to be wrestling with some of
these ideas throughout the

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.748
course.
So, let's begin with Kaufman's

00:09:01.748 --> 00:09:05.717
characterization of what he
calls pagan religion--that's the

00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:07.129
term that he uses.
 

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:10.689
The fundamental idea of pagan
religion, he says,

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:13.870
and I quote,
is "the idea that there exists

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.960
a realm of being prior to the
gods and above them,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.027
upon which they gods]
depend, and whose decrees,"

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:26.009
even "they must obey" --the
metadivine realm.

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:29.821
This is the realm of supreme
and ultimate power and it

00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:31.620
transcends the deities.
 

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.359
The deity or the deities emerge
from and are therefore subject

00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:39.037
to the laws of the metadivine
realm, the forces and powers of

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.570
the metadivine realm.
 

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.057
And the nature of this realm
will vary from pagan tradition

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:45.320
to pagan tradition.
 

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.130
It might be water.
 

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.010
It might be darkness.
 

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.690
It might be spirit.
 

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.679
Or in ancient Greek religion,
a more sort of philosophical

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.850
polytheism, it might be fate.
 

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.290
Even the gods are subject to
the decrees of fate;

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.259
they have no control over that.
 

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:03.639
Kaufman asserts,
therefore, this belief.

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:07.393
Once you posit a primordial
realm, some realm that is beside

00:10:07.393 --> 00:10:10.972
or beyond the gods,
that's independent of them and

00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:14.710
primary, you have automatically
limited the gods.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.464
So what I've done is I've
spelled out here for you,

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:19.447
consequences,
logical consequences of

00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:21.210
positing a metadivine realm.
 

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.831
Once you have a metadivine
realm all of these things are

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:24.966
going to follow.
The gods are going to be

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:25.070
limited.
 

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.230
 
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.039
They are not the source of all.
 

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:32.802
They are bound by,
they're subservient to,

00:10:32.802 --> 00:10:34.419
this metadivine realm.
 

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:38.075
There can therefore,
be no notion of a supreme

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:42.299
divine will, an absolute or
sovereign divine will.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:45.149
The will of any one god
ultimately can be countered by

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:48.268
the decrees of the primordial
realm and the will of all the

00:10:48.268 --> 00:10:51.710
gods can be thwarted by the
decrees of the primordial realm.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.460
The will of any one god can be
thwarted by perhaps another god.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.980
So the gods are limited in
power.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.855
They're also limited in their
wisdom: that falls under this as

00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:03.603
well.
They're not going to be

00:11:03.603 --> 00:11:07.059
all-knowing or all-wise because
of the existence of this realm

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:10.573
that's beyond them and which is
in many ways mysterious to them

00:11:10.573 --> 00:11:13.120
as well.
It's unpredictable to them too.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.679
It's not in their control or in
their power.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:17.679
Individual gods might be very
wise;

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:20.190
they might be wise in
particular crafts.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.733
There might be a god of
healing, very very wise in

00:11:22.733 --> 00:11:25.899
healing, or a god of some other
craft or area of knowledge.

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:30.651
But they possess wisdom as an
attribute, not as an essential

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:34.816
characteristic.
Kaufman asserts that mythology

00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:37.519
is basic to pagan religions.
 

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:41.363
Mythologies are the lives or
tales of the lives of gods,

00:11:41.363 --> 00:11:43.669
tales of the lives of the gods.
 

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:48.496
In pagan religions the gods are
born, and they live lives very

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:53.560
similar to human lives but on a
grand scale and then they die.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.379
They might be reborn too.
 

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:59.453
Pagan religions contain
theogonies, birth of a god,

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:03.120
"theogony", accounts of the
births of gods.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.294
Now this impersonal primordial
realm, Kaufman declares,

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:10.000
contains the seeds of all
beings.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.322
Very often in these creations
stories there is some sense of

00:12:13.322 --> 00:12:16.138
some realm from which life
begins to emerge usually

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:17.490
beginning with gods.
 

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:21.723
So these cosmogonies and
theogonies will describe the

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:26.120
generation of sexually
differentiated divine beings;

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.159
also the generation of the
natural world;

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:32.190
also the generation of human
beings and animals:

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.157
in other words,
this is the primordial womb for

00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:37.929
all that is--divine,
human and natural.

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:41.419
It is the source of everything
mundane and divine.

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:43.549
What that means,
Kaufman asserts,

00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:46.942
is that in pagan religion
there's very often a fluid

00:12:46.942 --> 00:12:50.535
boundary between the divine,
the human, and the natural

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:53.338
worlds.
They blur into one another

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:56.841
because they all emerge
ultimately from the same

00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:58.779
primordial world stuff.
 

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.669
These distinctions between them
are soft.

00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:04.673
We see this in the fact that
the gods are very often

00:13:04.673 --> 00:13:07.560
associated with natural powerful
forces, right?

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.700
The sky is a god;
the fire is a god;

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.379
fertility--a natural
process--is a god.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:18.709
So there's no real distinction
between the worship of gods and

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.019
the worship of nature.
 

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:22.575
Second, he says,
because humans also emerge

00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:26.409
ultimately from this primordial
realm there's a confusion of the

00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:30.059
boundary between the divine and
the human that's common,

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.734
he says--he chooses the word
"confusion"--that's common in

00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:36.728
pagan religion.
And so we often have in pagan

00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:40.460
religions unions between divine
beings and human beings.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.064
Kaufman argues,
and I quote,

00:13:42.064 --> 00:13:45.748
that "the continuity the divine
and human realm is the basis of

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:48.720
the pagan belief in apotheosis"
[Kaufman 1972,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.365
36]--humans becoming gods;
perhaps after death for example

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:57.558
becoming immortal,
or very often kings when they

00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:00.769
ascend to the throne become
gods.

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:04.290
Whatever power the gods have,
Kaufman says,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.152
is not due to the fact that
their will is absolute or their

00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:11.080
spirit is absolute.
 

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.509
The realm that transcends the
gods, this metadivine realm,

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:19.939
is that which has ultimate
power and the stuff of which it

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:22.970
is made is what has ultimate
power.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.549
So power is materially
conceived.

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:30.136
It inheres in certain things,
in certain substances,

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:33.722
particularly substances or
materials that are deeply

00:14:33.722 --> 00:14:37.730
connected to whatever this
primordial world stuff is.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.112
So if it's blood,
then blood that courses through

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:42.990
the veins of living creatures is
seen to have some deep and

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.769
powerful connection with the
metadivine realm and that is

00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.059
where power resides.
 

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:50.396
If it is water,
then water will be viewed as

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:55.129
particularly materially powerful
in that particular system.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:15:00.229
So gods have power only insofar
as they are connected with that

00:15:00.229 --> 00:15:04.506
primordial world "stuff," a
technical term that I use

00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:06.809
throughout this lecture!
 

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:11.330
That means that magic is
possible in such a system.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.774
Because power is materially
conceived--in other words,

00:15:14.774 --> 00:15:18.610
since it is believed to inhere
in certain natural substances

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.445
that resemble or are connected
to the primordial world stuff

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:26.085
that's the source of all
power--then magic is possible by

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:30.180
manipulating those material
substances in certain ways.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.910
It might be clay.
 

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.600
It might be water.
 

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.840
It might be blood.
 

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.940
Then whatever is believed to
hold the power of this

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.385
primordial life force,
humans can tap into,

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:45.059
and influence the activities of
the metadivine realm.

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:48.008
So through manipulation,
magical manipulation of certain

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:50.601
substances, they can harness,
Kaufman says,

00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.968
they can harness these forces,
these independent

00:15:53.968 --> 00:15:55.759
self-operating forces.
 

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:59.948
And so the human magician is
really a technician and he can

00:15:59.948 --> 00:16:03.559
make these forces come to bear
on even the gods,

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:06.049
to coerce the gods to do his
will and so on.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:09.428
So magic in a pagan system,
Kaufman claims,

00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:13.691
is a way of getting around the
gods, circumventing the

00:16:13.691 --> 00:16:17.149
capricious will of the gods and
demons.

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:19.762
His magic is directed at the
metadivine realm,

00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:21.620
trying to tap into its powers.
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.159
It's not directed at the gods.
 

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:26.437
It's trying to tap into the
ultimate source of power to use

00:16:26.437 --> 00:16:29.941
that power to influence the gods
in a particular way or protect

00:16:29.941 --> 00:16:31.580
oneself against the gods.
 

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.639
Similarly, divination.
 

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:37.098
Divination is an attempt to
discern the future that,

00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:39.460
once again, heads right to the
source of power.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.940
It's not directed at the gods,
unless you're hoping to use

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.594
them as a medium through which
to get access to the metadivine

00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:47.323
realm,
but ultimately most divination

00:16:47.323 --> 00:16:52.062
is aimed at tapping the secrets
of the metadivine realm and not

00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:54.544
the gods.
Discerning the will of the gods

00:16:54.544 --> 00:16:57.270
is really of little use,
because even their will can be

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.299
thwarted or overthrown by other
gods or by the decrees of the

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:01.409
metadivine realm.
 

00:17:01.409 --> 00:17:04.115
The pagan cult,
Kaufman claims,

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:06.190
is a system of rites.
 

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.389
Now I use the word "cult" and
every year people look at me and

00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:09.109
say "what is cult?
 

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.599
I don't even understand what
that means."

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.482
We'll learn more about "cult,"
but it refers to a system of

00:17:14.482 --> 00:17:16.327
rites, okay?
A system of rites,

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.849
and we'll be looking at the
Israelite cult later.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:22.396
So the pagan cult,
he says, is a system of rites

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:26.319
that involves a manipulation of
substances--again,

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.159
blood, animal flesh,
human flesh,

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:31.665
precious metals and so on--that
are believed to have some kind

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:34.412
of inherent power,
again, because of their

00:17:34.412 --> 00:17:38.150
connection to whatever the
primordial world stuff may be in

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.133
that tradition.
So according to Kaufman there's

00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:43.839
always an element of magic in
the pagan cult.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:47.446
It's seeking through these
rituals and manipulations of

00:17:47.446 --> 00:17:50.748
certain substances to,
again, let loose certain

00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:55.064
powers, set into motion certain
forces, that will coerce a god

00:17:55.064 --> 00:17:57.543
to be propitiated,
for example,

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:02.343
or calmed or to act favorably
or to vindicate the devotees,

00:18:02.343 --> 00:18:05.574
and so on.
Some of those cultic acts might

00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:09.536
be defensive or protective so
that the god cannot harm the

00:18:09.536 --> 00:18:12.342
worshiper.
Many of the cultic festivals

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:16.216
are keyed in to mythology,
the stories of the lives of the

00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:18.267
gods.
Many of the cultic festivals

00:18:18.267 --> 00:18:21.120
will be reenactments of events
in the life of the god:

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.920
a battle that the god had…the
death of the god.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.594
Usually in the winter,
cultic rituals will reenact the

00:18:26.594 --> 00:18:29.117
death of the god and then,
in spring, the rising or

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:30.529
resurrection of the god.
 

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:34.089
These are all reenactment
festivals that occur very often.

00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:37.595
And it's believed that by
reenacting these festivals in

00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:40.581
this cultic way,
one brings magical powers into

00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:44.671
play and can in fact ensure and
maintain the reemergence of life

00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:48.335
in the spring.
So it's essential for the

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:52.119
maintenance, preservation of the
world.

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:55.155
One final and very important
point, and we're going to

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:57.731
wrestle with this quite a bit
during the year:

00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:01.156
Kaufman claims,
again, in the polytheistic

00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:06.816
worldview, the primordial realm
contains the seeds of all being:

00:19:06.816 --> 00:19:10.680
everything is generated from
that realm,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.042
good and bad.
So just as there are good gods

00:19:16.042 --> 00:19:21.634
who might protect human beings
there are also evil gods who

00:19:21.634 --> 00:19:26.069
seek to destroy both humans and
other gods.

00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:30.459
Death and disease are consigned
to the realm of these evil

00:19:30.459 --> 00:19:34.848
demons or these impure evil
spirits, but they are siblings

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:36.619
with the good gods.
 

00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:40.253
Human beings are basically
powerless, he says,

00:19:40.253 --> 00:19:44.532
in the continual cosmic
struggle between the good gods

00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:48.432
and the evil demons,
unless they can utilize magic,

00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:52.160
divination, tap into the powers
of the metadivine realm,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.538
circumvent the gods who might
be making their lives rather

00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:58.611
miserable.
But what's important is that

00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:03.586
Kaufman insists that in the
pagan view evil is an antonomous

00:20:03.586 --> 00:20:06.958
demonic realm.
It is as primary and real as

00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.450
the realm of the holy or good
gods.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.869
Evil is a metaphysical reality.
 

00:20:11.869 --> 00:20:14.730
It is built into the structure
of the universe.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.980
That's the way the universe was
made.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.632
The primordial stuff that
spawned all that is,

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:22.225
spawned it good and bad and
exactly as it is,

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:24.170
and it's there and it's real.
 

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.180
 
 

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:33.450
Salvation, he says,
is the concern of humans.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.492
The gods aren't interested in
human salvation from the

00:20:36.492 --> 00:20:40.109
capricious forces and powers in
the world because they're trying

00:20:40.109 --> 00:20:41.430
to save themselves.
 

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.940
You know, the good gods are
being attacked by the evil gods;

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.608
the powers and decrees of the
metadivine realm are hassling

00:20:47.608 --> 00:20:49.569
them as well as anybody else.
 

00:20:49.569 --> 00:20:52.460
So they can't be worried about
humans;

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.279
they're worried about
themselves.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:57.867
Salvation is attained through
magic or gnostic

00:20:57.867 --> 00:21:02.569
means--gnosticism refers to
knowledge of secrets that can in

00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:07.512
some way liberate one from the
regular rules--and so as long as

00:21:07.512 --> 00:21:10.859
one can somehow circumvent the
gods,

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:13.992
tie oneself into the powers of
the metadivine realm to be

00:21:13.992 --> 00:21:17.459
beyond the reach of the demons
and the capricious gods who make

00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:21.519
life on earth a misery,
that is the path for salvation.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:26.819
So, Kaufman says that the pagan
worldview is one of an amoral

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:30.970
universe somewhere around
here…there we go.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.250
Amoral universe.
Not a moral universe;

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.370
not an immoral universe;
but an amoral universe.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.710
It is morally neutral.
 

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.151
There are gods who are
legislators and guardians of

00:21:42.151 --> 00:21:44.009
social order and justice.
 

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:47.828
But their laws aren't absolute:
they can be leveled by the

00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:50.710
decrees of this supreme
metadivine realm.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.103
And since the knowledge and
wisdom of each god is limited,

00:21:54.103 --> 00:21:57.436
morality can be defined as what
a particular god likes or

00:21:57.436 --> 00:22:00.650
desires and that may be
different from what another god

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.019
likes or desires.
 

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:04.930
And there's no absolute
morality then.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.542
And it's that picture of the
universe, Kaufman wants to

00:22:08.542 --> 00:22:12.490
argue, that is challenged by the
monotheistic revolution.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.329
Again he sees this as a
revolution of ancient Israel.

00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:21.105
So according to Kaufman the
fundamental idea of ancient

00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:25.172
Israelite writing,
which receives no systematic

00:22:25.172 --> 00:22:30.390
formulation but permeates the
entire Bible in his view,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.532
is a radically new idea of a
god who is himself the source of

00:22:35.532 --> 00:22:39.559
all being--not subject to a
metadivine realm.

00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:43.420
There's no transcendent cosmic
order or power.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.436
He does not emerge from some
preexisting realm and therefore

00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:52.432
he is free of all of the
limitations of myth and

00:22:52.432 --> 00:22:57.619
magic--we'll go through these
one by one--but a God whose will

00:22:57.619 --> 00:23:00.340
is absolute and sovereign.
 

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.789
All right?
So what then are the

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:06.849
implications of the elimination
of this metadivine realm?

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:10.000
Just as these points flowed
logically from positing a

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.545
metadivine realm,
what flows logically from

00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:16.180
eliminating a metadivine realm
and positing simply a god that

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.391
does not emerge from any
preexisting power or order or

00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:22.162
realm?
Well, first of all there's no

00:23:22.162 --> 00:23:24.549
theogony or mythology in the
Bible.

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:26.230
God isn't born from some
primordial womb;

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.410
he doesn't have a life story.
 

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.698
There's no realm that is
primary to him or prior to him

00:23:32.698 --> 00:23:37.146
and there is no realm that is
the source of his power and

00:23:37.146 --> 00:23:39.776
wisdom.
So in the opening chapters of

00:23:39.776 --> 00:23:41.230
Genesis, God simply is.
 

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.428
He doesn't grow,
he doesn't age,

00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:46.832
he doesn't mature,
he doesn't have in the Bible a

00:23:46.832 --> 00:23:50.420
female consort.
God doesn't die.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.228
So in the Hebrew Bible,
Kaufman claims,

00:23:53.228 --> 00:23:57.662
for the first time in history
we meet an unlimited God who is

00:23:57.662 --> 00:24:01.579
timeless and ageless and
nonphysical and eternal.

00:24:01.579 --> 00:24:06.430
That means that this God
transcends nature.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.707
Which means we're going to get
rid of number three as well,

00:24:09.707 --> 00:24:12.356
right?
As the sovereign of all realms,

00:24:12.356 --> 00:24:15.970
God isn't by nature bound to
any particular realm.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.074
He's not identifiable as a
force of nature or identified

00:24:20.074 --> 00:24:21.940
with a force of nature.
 

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.587
Nature certainly becomes the
stage of God's expression of his

00:24:26.587 --> 00:24:28.734
will.
He expresses his will and

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:31.750
purpose through forces of nature
in the Bible.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.940
But nature isn't God himself.
 

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.200
He's not identified .
 

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.109
He's wholly other.
 

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:41.450
He isn't kin to humans in any
way either.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:46.237
So there is no blurring,
no soft boundary between humans

00:24:46.237 --> 00:24:49.370
and the divine,
according to Kaufman,

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.458
in the Bible.
There's no apotheosis in the

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.130
Bible.
No life after death in the

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.029
Bible either.
Did you know that?

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.169
Have to wait a few centuries
for that idea to come along,

00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:03.645
but certainly not in the Hebrew
Bible: people live 70 years and

00:25:03.645 --> 00:25:06.174
that's it.
So there's no process by which

00:25:06.174 --> 00:25:09.664
humans become gods and certainly
no process of the reverse as

00:25:09.664 --> 00:25:12.504
well.
Magic in the Hebrew Bible is

00:25:12.504 --> 00:25:14.540
represented as useless.
 

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.607
It's pointless.
There's no metadivine realm to

00:25:18.607 --> 00:25:21.608
tap into.
Power doesn't inhere in any

00:25:21.608 --> 00:25:23.640
stuff in the natural world.
 

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.340
So the world is sort of
de-divinized.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.847
Demythologized.
Power isn't understood as a

00:25:29.847 --> 00:25:33.740
material thing or something that
inheres in material substances.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.109
God can't be manipulated or
coerced by charms or words or

00:25:38.109 --> 00:25:41.536
rituals.
They have no power and cannot

00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:45.369
be used in that way,
and so magic is sin.

00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:49.310
Magic is sin or rebellion
against God because it's

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.975
predicated on a whole mistaken
notion of God having limited

00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:56.325
power.
There are magical conceptions

00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:59.150
throughout the Bible--you're
going to run into them.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.215
But interestingly enough the
editors of the stories in which

00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:05.229
they appear will very often
hammer home the conclusion that

00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:09.170
actually what happened happened,
because God willed it to happen.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.029
The event occurred because God
wanted it to occur.

00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:15.797
It didn't occur independently
of his will or by virtue of some

00:26:15.797 --> 00:26:19.009
power that's inherent in the
magician's artifices.

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:24.126
So Kaufman argues that magic in
the Bible is recast as a witness

00:26:24.126 --> 00:26:27.049
to God's sovereignty,
God's power.

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:31.755
And they're stripped--magical
actions are stripped--of their

00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:33.430
autonomous potency.
 

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.161
Again, they're serving as
vehicles then for the

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.240
manifestation of the will of
God.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.237
Divination is also
unassimilable to the

00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:44.549
monotheistic idea,
according to Kaufman,

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:47.221
because it also presupposes the
existence of some metadivine

00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:51.035
realm, some source of power,
knowledge or information that

00:26:51.035 --> 00:26:54.296
transcends God.
And again, it's an attempt to

00:26:54.296 --> 00:26:57.846
reveal God's secrets in an
ungodly way, predicated on a

00:26:57.846 --> 00:27:00.536
mistake.
It is permitted to make

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:05.066
inquiries of God through
oracular devices but God only

00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:08.400
conveys information at his own
will.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.990
There's no ritual or
incantation, Kaufman says,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.829
or material substance that can
coerce a revelation from God.

00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:20.824
So, we will see things that
look like magic and divination

00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:24.818
and oracles and dreams and
prophecy in the pagan world and

00:27:24.818 --> 00:27:26.359
in ancient Israel.
 

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:29.980
But Kaufman says the similarity
is a similarity in form only.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.829
And it's a superficial,
formal, external similarity.

00:27:33.829 --> 00:27:37.520
Each of these phenomena he says
is transformed by the basic

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.273
Israelite idea of one supreme
transcendent God whose will is

00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:45.154
absolute and all of these things
relate to the direct word and

00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:47.961
will of God.
They aren't recourse to a

00:27:47.961 --> 00:27:51.948
separate science or lore or body
of knowledge or interpretive

00:27:51.948 --> 00:27:56.135
craft that calls upon forces or
powers that transcend God or are

00:27:56.135 --> 00:27:57.730
independent of God.
 

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.241
By the same token the cult,
Kaufman says,

00:28:01.241 --> 00:28:04.490
has no automatic or material
power.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.425
It's not just sort of a place
where certain kinds of magical

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:08.569
coercive acts happen.
 

00:28:08.569 --> 00:28:12.133
The cult isn't designed to
service the material needs of

00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:14.640
God, either.
It doesn't affect his life and

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.733
vitality by enacting certain
rituals: you don't ensure that

00:28:17.733 --> 00:28:19.279
God doesn't die and so on.
 

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:23.616
No events in God's life are
celebrated--the festivals that

00:28:23.616 --> 00:28:26.660
are carried out in the cultic
context.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.789
So the mythological rationales
for cult that you find amongst

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:34.897
Israel's neighbors are replaced,
and they're replaced very often

00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:36.380
by historical rationales.
 

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.938
This action is done to
commemorate such and such event

00:28:39.938 --> 00:28:42.019
in the history of the nation.
 

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:45.293
So pagan festivals in Israel,
Kaufman says,

00:28:45.293 --> 00:28:48.723
are historicized,
commemorating events in the

00:28:48.723 --> 00:28:53.087
life of the people and not in
the story of the god's life

00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:55.660
since we have no mythology.
 

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.121
But we are going to be spending
a fair amount of time talking

00:28:59.121 --> 00:29:02.641
actually about the meaning and
the function of Israel's purity

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:05.180
laws and cultic laws in a later
lecture.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:11.787
Now since God is himself the
transcendent source of all being

00:29:11.787 --> 00:29:17.154
and since he is good,
in a monotheistic system there

00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:22.257
are no evil agents that
constitute a realm that opposes

00:29:22.257 --> 00:29:24.620
God as an equal rival.
 

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.740
No divine evil agents.
 

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.980
Again, in the pagan worldview
the primordial womb spawns all

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.178
sorts of beings,
all kinds of divinities,

00:29:33.178 --> 00:29:35.650
good and evil that are in equal
strength.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.319
They're sort of locked in this
cosmic struggle.

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:41.373
But in the Israelite worldview,
if God is the source of all

00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:44.426
being, then they're can't be a
realm of supernatural beings

00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:45.900
that do battle with him.
 

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.315
There's no room for a divine
antagonist of the one supreme

00:29:50.315 --> 00:29:54.034
God, which is leading us down
here to this point:

00:29:54.034 --> 00:29:57.830
that sin and evil are
demythologized in the Hebrew

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.059
Bible.
And that's very interesting.

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:02.339
It's going to lead to a lot of
interesting things.

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:04.849
It's also going to create a
really huge problem for

00:30:04.849 --> 00:30:07.559
monotheistic thought they're
going to struggle with for

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:10.369
centuries and actually still do
struggle with today.

00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:14.140
But again, in the pagan
worldview, sin is understood

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.427
very often as the work of a
demon or an evil god that might

00:30:18.427 --> 00:30:21.865
possess a person,
might have to be exorcised from

00:30:21.865 --> 00:30:23.750
that person by means of magic.
 

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.791
If you tap into some of these
substances then you can use the

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.920
magical, the powers in those
substances,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.990
to coerce the demon to be
expelled from the person's body.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:35.182
These are things that are very
common in polytheistic and pagan

00:30:35.182 --> 00:30:37.407
practices.
But in Israel we have no

00:30:37.407 --> 00:30:41.759
metadivine realm to spawn these
evil beings, these various gods.

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:46.271
So Israelite religion did not
conceive of sin as caused by an

00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:50.708
independent evil power that
exists out there in the universe

00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:53.339
and is defying the will of God.
 

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:58.180
Instead evil comes about as a
result of the clash of the will

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.941
of God and the will of humans
who happen to have the freedom

00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:06.215
to rebel.
There's nothing inherently

00:31:06.215 --> 00:31:08.269
supernatural about sin.
 

00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:12.539
It's not a force or a power
built into the universe.

00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:15.345
Kaufman is claiming therefore
that in Israel evil is

00:31:15.345 --> 00:31:18.095
transferred from the
metaphysical realm (built into

00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:21.560
the physical structure of the
universe) to the moral realm.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.529
I've put it up here for you.
 

00:31:22.529 --> 00:31:27.710
Evil is a moral and not a
metaphysical reality.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.079
It doesn't have a concrete
independent existence.

00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:34.415
And that means that human
beings and only human beings are

00:31:34.415 --> 00:31:36.990
the potential source of evil in
the world.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.400
Responsibility for evil lies in
the hands of human beings.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.862
In the Hebrew Bible,
no one will ever say the devil

00:31:43.862 --> 00:31:45.971
made me do it.
There is no devil in the Hebrew

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.161
Bible.
That's also the invention of a

00:31:48.161 --> 00:31:51.061
much later age.
And that is an important and

00:31:51.061 --> 00:31:53.019
critical ethical revolution.
 

00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:55.380
Evil is a moral and not a
metaphysical reality .

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.635
You had a.
Student: What about the

00:31:58.635 --> 00:32:00.490
serpent in the Garden of Eden?
 

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.379
Professor Christine
Hayes: Great.

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:02.200
That's what you get to talk
about.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.049
Wonderful question.
 

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:05.520
Well what about when Eve is
tempted by the serpent?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.720
Who is the serpent?
 

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.775
What is he doing?
 

00:32:07.775 --> 00:32:09.920
What's going on?
What is Kaufman claiming?

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.705
Okay.
That's exactly the kind of

00:32:11.705 --> 00:32:14.543
stuff that should be popping
into your head----What

00:32:14.543 --> 00:32:17.016
about...what about?--okay,
and in section,

00:32:17.016 --> 00:32:19.770
you're going to be discussing
exactly that story.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.200
Okay?
And that's one of those texts...

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.544
and in a minute if I haven't at
the end of a lecture,

00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:27.248
ask again if I haven't kind of
gotten to part of an answer to

00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:30.329
your question.
Okay?

00:32:30.329 --> 00:32:35.405
But again, this emphasis on
evil as a moral choice--think of

00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:39.437
Genesis 4, where God warns Cain,
who's filled with anger and

00:32:39.437 --> 00:32:41.774
jealousy and is thinking about
doing all kinds of horrible

00:32:41.774 --> 00:32:43.846
things to his brother,
and God says,

00:32:43.846 --> 00:32:48.044
"Sin couches at the door;
/ Its urge is toward you,

00:32:48.044 --> 00:32:50.569
/ Yet you can be its master".
 

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:53.240
This is a question of moral
choice.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.616
Final point then is...and we're
not going to talk about

00:32:56.616 --> 00:33:00.305
salvation right now...but we're
going to talk about the fact

00:33:00.305 --> 00:33:03.369
that the only supreme law is the
will of God,

00:33:03.369 --> 00:33:07.630
because God is a creator God
rather than a created God.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.480
He's imposed order,
an order upon the cosmos.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.621
And so the pagan picture of an
amoral universe of just

00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.043
competing powers,
good and evil,

00:33:18.043 --> 00:33:21.324
Kaufman says,
is transformed into a picture

00:33:21.324 --> 00:33:23.200
of a moral cosmos.
 

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.781
The highest law is the will of
God and that imposes a morality

00:33:27.781 --> 00:33:30.559
upon the structure of the
universe.

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:35.971
So in sum, Kaufman's argument
is this: Israel conceived of the

00:33:35.971 --> 00:33:38.809
divine in an entirely new way.
 

00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:43.197
Israel's God differed from the
pagan gods in his essential

00:33:43.197 --> 00:33:45.436
nature.
The pagan gods were natural

00:33:45.436 --> 00:33:47.462
gods.
They were very often associated

00:33:47.462 --> 00:33:50.773
with blind forces of nature with
no intrinsic moral character,

00:33:50.773 --> 00:33:53.121
he says.
And the god of Israel was

00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:56.976
understood to transcend nature
and his will was not only

00:33:56.976 --> 00:34:00.200
absolute, it was absolutely good
and moral.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.242
A lot of people say,
well in a way didn't we just

00:34:02.242 --> 00:34:03.690
rename the metadivine realm God?
 

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.900
No.
Because the difference here is

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.559
that it's posited not only that
this God is the only power but

00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:11.000
that he is only good.
 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.440
And that was not the case with
the metadivine realm.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.860
Right?
That was morally neutral.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.335
But there's a moral claim
that's being made by the writers

00:34:18.335 --> 00:34:21.017
of the Hebrew Bible about this
supreme power,

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:23.988
this God.
God is depicted as just,

00:34:23.988 --> 00:34:27.596
compassionate.
Morality therefore is perceived

00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:30.059
as conforming to the will of
God.

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:34.040
And there are absolute
standards then of justice and

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.679
reverence for life.
 

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.336
Now Kaufman says God is
demythologized,

00:34:38.336 --> 00:34:41.972
but even though he's
demythologized he's not rendered

00:34:41.972 --> 00:34:43.789
completely impersonal.
 

00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:45.877
He's spoken of
anthropomorphically,

00:34:45.877 --> 00:34:49.500
so that we can capture his
interaction with human beings.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.146
This is the only way,
Kaufman says,

00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:53.955
you can write in any meaningful
sense about the interaction

00:34:53.955 --> 00:34:55.360
between God and humanity.
 

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.739
So he has to be
anthropomorphized.

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:00.917
But the interaction between God
and humans, he says,

00:35:00.917 --> 00:35:03.969
happens not through nature but
through history.

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:07.000
God is not known through
natural manifestations.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.682
He's known by his action in the
world in historical time and his

00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:13.019
relationship with a historical
people.

00:35:13.019 --> 00:35:16.193
I just want to read you a few
sentences from an article

00:35:16.193 --> 00:35:18.662
Kaufman wrote,
a different one from the one

00:35:18.662 --> 00:35:21.384
that you read.
But it sums up his idea that

00:35:21.384 --> 00:35:25.130
there's an abyss that separates
monotheism and polytheism and he

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.638
says that it would be a mistake
to think that the difference

00:35:28.638 --> 00:35:31.551
between the two is
arithmetic--that a polytheistic

00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:34.821
tradition in which there are ten
gods is a lot more like

00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:38.448
monotheism than a polytheistic
tradition in which there are 40

00:35:38.448 --> 00:35:41.273
gods,
because as you get smaller in

00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:44.179
number it gets closer to being
monotheistic.

00:35:44.179 --> 00:35:46.375
He says the pagan idea,
and I quote,

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:50.077
"does not approach Israelite
monotheism as it diminishes the

00:35:50.077 --> 00:35:51.519
number of its gods.
 

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:54.223
The Israelite conception of
God's unity entails His

00:35:54.223 --> 00:35:56.170
sovereign transcendence over
all."

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.409
That's the real issue.
 

00:35:57.409 --> 00:36:00.445
"It rejects the pagan idea of a
realm beyond the deity,

00:36:00.445 --> 00:36:02.469
the source of mythology and
magic.

00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:05.884
The affirmation that the will
of God is supreme and absolutely

00:36:05.884 --> 00:36:08.739
free is a new and non-pagan
category of thought".

00:36:08.739 --> 00:36:11.856
That's in an article in the
Great Ages and Ideas of the

00:36:11.856 --> 00:36:12.949
Jewish People.
 

00:36:12.949 --> 00:36:16.686
And he goes on again to say
that this affirmation isn't

00:36:16.686 --> 00:36:20.354
stated dogmatically anywhere but
it pervades Israelite

00:36:20.354 --> 00:36:22.500
creativity, biblical texts.
 

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.952
He also asserts that the idea
kind of developed over time,

00:36:25.952 --> 00:36:29.344
but that basically there was a
fundamental revolution and

00:36:29.344 --> 00:36:32.211
break,
and then within that there was

00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:36.960
some development of some of the
latent potential of that idea.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.843
So, which is it,
which is part of the question

00:36:40.843 --> 00:36:43.260
that came from over here,?
 

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.796
You have on the one hand the
claim that Israelite religion is

00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:50.449
essentially continuous with
Ancient Near Eastern polytheism.

00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:53.669
It's merely limiting the number
of gods worshipped to one,

00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:55.760
but it houses that God in a
temple.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.710
It offers him sacrifices and so
on.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.796
And then on the other hand we
have Kaufman's claim that

00:37:01.796 --> 00:37:05.340
Israelite religion is a radical
break from the religions of the

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.769
Ancient Near Eastern.
 

00:37:06.769 --> 00:37:10.317
Well, the value of Kaufman's
work, I think,

00:37:10.317 --> 00:37:15.047
lies in the insight that
monotheism and polytheism in the

00:37:15.047 --> 00:37:20.368
abstract--now I'm not sure they
exist anywhere in the world--but

00:37:20.368 --> 00:37:25.098
in the abstract are predicated
on divergent intuitions as

00:37:25.098 --> 00:37:28.856
systems.
They do seem to describe very

00:37:28.856 --> 00:37:30.349
different worlds.
 

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:34.638
And therefore as a system,
the difference between Israel's

00:37:34.638 --> 00:37:38.550
God and the gods of Israel's
neighbors was not merely

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.800
quantitative.
It was qualitative.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.159
There's a qualitative
difference here.

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:47.119
However when you read his work
it's clear that he often has to

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:50.170
force his evidence and force it
rather badly.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.548
And it's simply a fact,
that practices and ideas that

00:37:54.548 --> 00:37:59.178
are not strictly or even
strongly monotheistic do appear

00:37:59.178 --> 00:38:02.452
in the Bible.
So perhaps those scholars who

00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:06.202
stress the continuity between
Israel and her environment are

00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:09.770
right after all.
And this impasse I think can be

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:14.492
resolved to a large degree when
we realize that we have to make

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:18.909
a distinction between--well
let's do it this way first.

00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:21.540
We're going to talk about a
distinction between the

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.487
actual--I hate to say that as if
I can somehow show you a

00:38:24.487 --> 00:38:27.591
snapshot of what people did
3,000 years ago--but between the

00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:30.275
actual religious practices and
beliefs of the actual

00:38:30.275 --> 00:38:33.809
inhabitants of Israel and Judah,
we're going to call that

00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:37.144
Israelite-Judean religion:
what somebody back in the year

00:38:37.144 --> 00:38:40.480
900 BCE might have done when
they went to the temple;

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.919
and what they might have
thought they were doing

00:38:42.919 --> 00:38:45.282
when they went to the temple,
because I'm not sure it was

00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:47.350
necessarily what the author of
the Book of Deuteronomy says

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.989
they were doing when they go to
the temple;

00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:51.921
so there's a difference between
what actual people,

00:38:51.921 --> 00:38:54.150
the inhabitants of Israel and
Judah,

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.003
did--we'll call that Israelite
Judean religion--and the

00:38:57.003 --> 00:38:59.255
religion that's promoted,
or the worldview,

00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:01.539
I prefer that term,
that's being promoted by the

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:04.453
later writers and editors of
biblical stories who are telling

00:39:04.453 --> 00:39:07.659
the story of these people--we'll
call that biblical religion,

00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:12.800
the religion or the worldview
that we can see emerging from

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.750
many biblical texts.
 

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.186
That distinction is found in an
article in your Jewish Study

00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:19.739
Bible, an article by Steven
Geller (Geller 2004,2021-2040).

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:22.710
You're going to be reading that
later on in the course.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.710
But be aware of that
distinction and that article.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:30.483
What second millennium Hebrews
and early first millennium

00:39:30.483 --> 00:39:34.886
Israelites or Judeans,
Judahites, actually believed or

00:39:34.886 --> 00:39:38.687
did is not always retrievable,
in fact probably not

00:39:38.687 --> 00:39:40.360
retrievable, to us.
 

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.800
We have some clues.
 

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.304
But in all likelihood Hebrews
of an older time,

00:39:44.304 --> 00:39:47.245
the patriarchal period,
the second millennium BCE--they

00:39:47.245 --> 00:39:50.130
probably weren't markedly
different from many of their

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.710
polytheistic neighbors.
 

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.070
Archaeology would suggest that.
 

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.809
In some ways that's true.
 

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:58.281
We do find evidence in the
Bible as well as in the

00:39:58.281 --> 00:40:01.894
archaeological record,
of popular practices that are

00:40:01.894 --> 00:40:04.019
not strictly monotheistic.
 

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:09.795
The worship of little household
idols, local fertility deities,

00:40:09.795 --> 00:40:13.133
for example.
Most scholars conjecture that

00:40:13.133 --> 00:40:16.920
ancient Israelite-Judean
religion, the practices of the

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.707
people in the kingdoms of Israel
and Judah in the first

00:40:20.707 --> 00:40:23.530
millennium BCE,
was maybe monolatrist.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.158
They might have promoted the
worship of one God,

00:40:26.158 --> 00:40:29.178
Yahweh, without denying the
existence of other gods and

00:40:29.178 --> 00:40:32.590
still kept their little idols
and fertility gods or engaged in

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.659
various syncretistic practices.
 

00:40:34.659 --> 00:40:38.142
It was probably monolatrist
rather than monotheistic,

00:40:38.142 --> 00:40:41.289
really asserting the reality of
only one God.

00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:45.760
Moreover our evidence suggests
that Yahweh was in many respects

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.869
very similar to many of the gods
of Canaanite religion.

00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:52.225
And we'll be talking about some
of those at the appropriate

00:40:52.225 --> 00:40:54.520
time.
But continuities with Canaanite

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.958
and Ancient Near Eastern
religions are apparent in the

00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:01.784
worship practices and the cult
objects of ancient Israel and

00:41:01.784 --> 00:41:05.611
Judah as they're described in
the biblical stories and as we

00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:08.659
find them in archaeological
discoveries.

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:12.505
The Hebrew Bible also contains
sources that exhibit features of

00:41:12.505 --> 00:41:16.039
what Kaufman has described as
contemporary polytheisms.

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:18.384
In Genesis 6--I mean,
the text you pointed out is a

00:41:18.384 --> 00:41:21.064
good one but even better,
go look at Genesis 6 where you

00:41:21.064 --> 00:41:23.798
have these nephilim,
these divine beings who descend

00:41:23.798 --> 00:41:25.920
to earth and they mate with
female humans.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.777
That's a real fluid boundary
between the divine and human

00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:31.429
realms, if you ask me.
 

00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:34.309
But it only happens there,
in one spot.

00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:38.371
In many passages too Yahweh is
represented as presiding over a

00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:40.714
counsel of gods.
Certainly in the Psalms we have

00:41:40.714 --> 00:41:42.670
these sort of poetic and
metaphoric descriptions where

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.219
God is, "Okay guys,
what do you think?"

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:45.889
presiding--or he's one of them,
actually.

00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:47.496
In one Psalm--it's great--he's
one of the gods and he says,

00:41:47.496 --> 00:41:48.910
"You know, you guys don't know
what you're doing.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.250
Let me take over."
 

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.269
And he stands up in the council
and takes over.

00:41:52.269 --> 00:41:55.812
And there are other passages in
the Bible too that assume the

00:41:55.812 --> 00:41:59.000
existence of other gods
worshipped by other nations.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.674
So there's certainly stuff like
that in there you have to think

00:42:01.674 --> 00:42:03.084
about.
Now nevertheless,

00:42:03.084 --> 00:42:06.902
the most strongly monotheistic
sources of the Bible do posit a

00:42:06.902 --> 00:42:10.220
God that is qualitatively
different from the gods that

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.788
populated the mythology of
Israel's neighbors and probably

00:42:13.788 --> 00:42:16.230
also Israelite- Judean religion.
 

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:19.469
In these sources the
Israelites' deity is clearly the

00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:20.840
source of all being.
 

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.740
He doesn't emerge from a
preexisting realm.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.600
He has no divine siblings.
 

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.050
His will is absolute.
 

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.000
His will is sovereign.
 

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.360
He's not affected by magical
coercion.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.186
And biblical monotheism,
biblical religion,

00:42:32.186 --> 00:42:35.080
assumes that this God is
inherently good.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.099
He's just.
He's compassionate.

00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:41.329
And human morality is
conformity to his will.

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:45.365
Because certain texts of the
Bible posit this absolutely good

00:42:45.365 --> 00:42:48.929
God who places absolute moral
demands on humankind,

00:42:48.929 --> 00:42:53.170
biblical monotheism is often
referred to as ethical

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.749
monotheism, so it's a term that
you'll see quite a bit:

00:42:57.749 --> 00:42:59.699
ethical monotheism.
 

00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:03.098
Beginning perhaps as early as
the eighth century and

00:43:03.098 --> 00:43:05.429
continuing for several
centuries,

00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:08.850
literate and decidedly
monotheistic circles within

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.479
Israelite society put a
monotheistic framework on the

00:43:12.479 --> 00:43:15.900
ancient stories and traditions
of the nation.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.548
They molded them into a
foundation myth that would shape

00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:22.930
Israelite and Jewish
self-identity and understanding

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.389
in a profound way.
 

00:43:24.389 --> 00:43:27.586
They projected their monotheism
onto an earlier time,

00:43:27.586 --> 00:43:30.230
onto the nation's most ancient
ancestors.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.083
Israelite monotheism is
represented in the Bible as

00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.510
beginning with Abraham.
 

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.003
Historically speaking it most
likely began much later,

00:43:38.003 --> 00:43:41.827
and probably as a minority
movement that grew to prominence

00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.863
over centuries.
But that later monotheism is

00:43:44.863 --> 00:43:48.621
projected back over Israel's
history by the final editors of

00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:51.605
the Bible.
And that creates the impression

00:43:51.605 --> 00:43:55.570
of the biblical religion that
Kaufman describes so well.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.087
But the biblical text itself,
the biblical record,

00:43:59.087 --> 00:44:02.533
is very conflicted,
and that's part of the fun of

00:44:02.533 --> 00:44:05.262
reading it.
And you will see the biblical

00:44:05.262 --> 00:44:08.679
record pointing to two different
and conflicting realities.

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:11.578
You will find religious
practices and views that aren't

00:44:11.578 --> 00:44:14.905
strictly monotheistic and you'll
find later religious practices

00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:16.139
and views that are.
 

00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:19.203
And the later sources,
which we might best call

00:44:19.203 --> 00:44:22.466
biblical religion,
are breaking therefore not only

00:44:22.466 --> 00:44:25.662
with Ancient Near Eastern
practices but also with

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:29.373
Israelite-Judean practices,
with other elements within

00:44:29.373 --> 00:44:30.480
their own society.
 

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.983
So biblical religion as Kaufman
describes it,

00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:35.374
isn't, I think,
just a revolution of Israel

00:44:35.374 --> 00:44:36.739
against the nations.
 

00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:40.150
I think it's also a civil war
of Israel against itself.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.498
And that's an aspect that is
really not entertained by

00:44:43.498 --> 00:44:45.687
Kaufman.
And I think it's an important

00:44:45.687 --> 00:44:48.964
one for us to entertain so that
we can allow the biblical text

00:44:48.964 --> 00:44:51.059
to speak to us in all its
polyphony.

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:53.961
And not try to force it all
into one model:

00:44:53.961 --> 00:44:57.070
"Well, I know this is
monotheistic text so,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.864
gosh, I'd better come up with
an explanation of Genesis 6 that

00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:03.396
works with monotheism,"
You're going be freed of having

00:45:03.396 --> 00:45:05.165
to do that;
you're going to be freed of

00:45:05.165 --> 00:45:05.760
having to do that.
 

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.250
Let the text be contradictory
and inconsistent and difficult.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.890
Let it be difficult.
 

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.750
Don't homogenize it all.
 

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.350
So the differences between the
god of the monotheizing sources

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.419
of the Bible and the gods of
surrounding Mesopotamian

00:45:19.419 --> 00:45:21.840
literature and older Israelite
ideas,

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.150
perhaps, they're apparent from
the very first chapters of

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:28.055
Genesis.
That's a creation story in

00:45:28.055 --> 00:45:30.632
Genesis 1, we're going to see,
a creation story that's added

00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:32.714
to the Pentateuch,
Pentateuch, the first five

00:45:32.714 --> 00:45:34.909
books of the Bible,
Genesis through Deuteronomy.

00:45:34.909 --> 00:45:38.603
This creation story is added to
the Pentateuch probably in one

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:42.296
of the last rounds of editing,
probably sixth century perhaps,

00:45:42.296 --> 00:45:43.809
we don't really know.
 

00:45:43.809 --> 00:45:47.639
But Genesis 1 is a very
strongly monotheistic opening to

00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:51.608
the primeval myths that are then
contained in the next ten

00:45:51.608 --> 00:45:53.280
chapters of Genesis.
 

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.324
So next time we're going to
start with a close reading and

00:45:56.324 --> 00:45:58.300
examination of Genesis 1 through
4.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.901
We're going to read these
stories with an eye to Israel's

00:46:01.901 --> 00:46:05.375
adaptation of Near Eastern
motifs and themes to sort of

00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:08.655
monotheize those motifs and
themes and express a new

00:46:08.655 --> 00:46:12.000
conception of God and the world
and humankind.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.122
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, I want to just finish

00:00:04.122 --> 00:00:06.743
off, because trying to do the
collaboration in one week is not

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:08.550
easy.
I want to talk a little bit

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.496
more about Vichy and the Jews,
and then mention something

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:13.390
about François
Mitterrand,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.845
the late president of France,
and the whole question of

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:23.955
forgetting and then remembering;
and then I'll leap into

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.369
resistance.
Just at the beginning,

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.975
just to put the perspective of
how the French Vichy forces or

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:36.198
our government's treatment of
the Jews compares to other

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:39.284
countries,
that in November of

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:45.395
1942--that's a crucial period
because it's at that point that

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:51.811
the Germans occupy the so-called
free zone or Vichy zone--and at

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:57.819
that point Vichy authorities
hand over the Jews who had been

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.810
imprisoned in the Vichy zone to
the Nazis.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.936
And they had marked their
ration cards--you had to have

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:08.426
ration cards,
you had to have cards to get a

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:11.841
little bit of butter and all
this kind of stuff--they marked

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.099
them juif or
juive,

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.319
selon le cas,
which means Jew,

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.662
which made it easier for the
German or the French police to

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:25.471
arrest them.
And, so, not only did

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:32.560
they--they had to sort of turn
over what was left of their

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.400
authority, but they did more
than they needed to do.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.662
And things were so bad for the
Jews at the hands of the Vichy

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:48.209
police that when thousands of
foreign Jews had gone into Nice,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.846
had somehow gotten into Nice,
which Mussolini's fascist

00:01:54.846 --> 00:02:00.787
troops had occupied,
that they essentially arrested

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:07.153
them or made it easier for the
people there to be identified

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:12.871
and to be taken by the fascists.
And in October 1942,

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:15.924
when the U.S.
government proposed to take

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:19.939
1,000 Jewish kids whose parents
had been deported without them,

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.806
Pierre Laval,
who would get his after the

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:26.174
war, and René
Bousquet, who is the police

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:30.402
head who was the one that was
murdered before his trial by a

00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:33.340
guy seeking publicity for his
book,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.793
they replied that only
certified orphans could be given

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:40.822
exit visas, and thus because you
couldn't prove that the parents

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.379
had already died in the death
camps,

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.678
they would not allow the Jewish
children to be exiled,

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:50.759
to be refugees in the United
States.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.769
And Laval and Bousquet,
both of whom were frenetic

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.979
anti-Semites,
knew this very well.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:01.915
So, essentially they just
condemned them to their fate and

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:06.367
the children couldn't leave.
And more than five weeks

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.852
following the Allied invasion of
Normandy, which as you know was

00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:13.198
on the 6th of June,
1944, the Vichy police were

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:17.220
still arresting Jews,
and right up until the last,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.613
into the last days.
And so many of the cases of the

00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:23.090
miliciens,
people in the milice,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.706
who were gunned down at the
very end of the war during

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:31.006
liberation had been--these were
people who had gone out of their

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:35.100
way simply to keep on arresting
Jews and killing Jews when it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.195
was clear that the Allies were
going to come in and chase the

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.993
Germans out.
In the eight months of 1944

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:47.680
before liberation almost 15,000
Jews were deported;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.889
and deported means to the death
camps.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.758
So, anyway, three-quarters of
all the Jews who were arrested

00:03:56.758 --> 00:04:02.129
in France during the entire
period were arrested by the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.849
French police.
French recteurs-

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.629
-recteurs were the heads
of the academies,

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.135
that is France is divided into
academies,

00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:16.387
that is the whole structure of
education from the universities

00:04:16.387 --> 00:04:19.330
down to the maternelle,
to kindergarten,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.357
the recteurs demissed
Jews from their post--and you

00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:26.913
met one of them,
Marc Bloch, whom I said lost

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:29.699
his job twice;
he lost it in Strasbourg and

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.717
then in Montpellier.
And in Marseilles the Order of

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:36.352
Doctors purged Jews from the
right to practice and complained

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:39.259
that there were still Jews in
medical school.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.121
Now, again they didn't have to
do this, the Germans weren't

00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.815
saying--they had other things,
security and things that they

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:50.265
were worried about--"security"
in quotes--but it was just done

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:55.507
because they wanted to do it.
And it's the same thing in the

00:04:55.507 --> 00:05:01.321
legal profession where lots of
magistrates, as in the case of

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:05.306
Hitler's Germany,
in Weimar before Hitler came to

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:07.683
power, the magistrates,
many of them,

00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:10.512
most of them,
had been trained under the

00:05:10.512 --> 00:05:13.238
Second Reich,
that is before World War I,

00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:16.920
and they flocked to the extreme
right very quickly.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.991
Public opinion in general did
not criticize measures taken

00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:25.550
against the Jews,
at least until 1942.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.957
And as I said the other day,
there were so many

00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:33.106
denunciations of people that
were--notes that said "je

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:36.440
suis sure que mon voisin il est
jui,"

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.259
I'm sure that my neighbor he's
a Jew.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.339
And the costs of this were
rather serious.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.093
So, what do we know about the
reactions of non-Jewish French

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.819
men and women to what was going
on?

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.795
Well, late in 1940 900,000
people visited an exposition

00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:55.231
that Vichy had put up in the
Petit Palais in Paris about the

00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.865
alleged links of Freemasons,
that is free thinkers,

00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:04.299
to Jews and to the British.
So, if you went into--this was

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:07.961
just the equivalent--well,
it wasn't the artistic

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.692
equivalent,
but it was rather like if you

00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:14.075
went to--that you were going
with the same sort of spirit as

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:17.458
if you went to one of the art
shows that Hitler put on about

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:19.992
decadent art,
decadent or Jewish art,

00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:23.528
and this sort of stuff.
Another 114,000 people saw the

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:26.939
exposition when it went on a
tour of the provinces.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:33.817
Another exposition called "The
Jew in France" attracted in 1942

00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:40.139
250,000 visitors in Paris and
100,000 in the provinces.

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.866
The German film that--to which
the Nazis and other Rightists in

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:49.136
Germany had flocked called
The Jew Süss which

00:06:49.136 --> 00:06:53.464
ends with a Jew being hung,
to the frenzied applause of

00:06:53.464 --> 00:06:57.829
audiences, was shown in France
and people did go to see it,

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.882
not huge numbers of people,
and there were even

00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:04.493
demonstrations in two cities.
But in Tours,

00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:09.154
on the Loire,
people lined up around the

00:07:09.154 --> 00:07:15.009
block in order to come in and
see this essentially

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.790
Hitler--well,
Nazi publicity movie.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.706
And the collaborationist
newspaper, Je Suis

00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:28.858
Partout, or I Am
Everywhere,

00:07:28.858 --> 00:07:34.540
sold 250,000 copies in 1942 and
300,000 by 1944;

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.522
yes, 1944, which ends as you
know in August in 1944--1944

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:44.860
doesn't end in August but the
Germans are--Paris falls at the

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.931
end of August 1944 and then
gradually the war moves to the

00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:52.960
east.
In a novel by a guy called

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.273
Lucien Rebatet,
called Les Decombres

00:07:56.273 --> 00:08:00.059
sold--a very rightwing
thing--sold 65,000 copies,

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:04.634
which is a huge sale in France,
its first month out and its

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:09.129
publisher claimed that only the
shortage of paper,

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:13.379
war rationing,
kept him from selling another

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:16.603
200,000 copies.
And here's a glimpse of what is

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:19.047
in the novel.
"I wish the victory of Germany

00:08:19.047 --> 00:08:22.096
because her war is my war.
Oh, my machinegun,

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:26.937
so often caressed in my dreams,
facing the despised gangs of

00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:31.040
the Popular Front,
the gilded ghettos of Sodom.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.759
One hundred well aimed machine
gun bursts."

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:37.603
He exuded about the sight of
Jews wearing yellow stars,

00:08:37.603 --> 00:08:40.379
the Jewish bacillus,
the Jewish microbe,

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:44.280
and all this.
Now, the French record is not

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.639
very good, even compared with
other countries,

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:53.328
the spectacular exception being
Slovakia, which was certainly

00:08:53.328 --> 00:08:57.704
one of the worst places you
could possibly have been as a

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.013
Jew,
and not too far from Auschwitz,

00:09:01.013 --> 00:09:06.207
across the frontier in Poland,
which turned over both natives

00:09:06.207 --> 00:09:09.669
and foreign Jews to Nazis right
away.

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:12.814
Vichy France was the only
country in which local

00:09:12.814 --> 00:09:16.025
authorities deported Jews
without the presence of

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:18.394
occupying forces.
And in Hungary,

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:21.547
which had had anti-Semitic
legislation since 1920,

00:09:21.547 --> 00:09:25.535
even the vicious admiral called
Horthy--he is not in the course

00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:31.027
but he was vicious anyway,
h-o-r-t-h-y--handed over no

00:09:31.027 --> 00:09:39.059
Jews who were Hungarian Jews
until German occupation in 1944.

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:43.021
In Denmark only seven percent
of the Jews disappeared,

00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:46.460
helped by Danes and the
proximity of Sweden.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.608
Malmo was just across the
straights, it's still just

00:09:48.608 --> 00:09:50.799
across the straights,
except there's a bridge now.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:55.303
Yet France was the country in
which the greatest percentage of

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:59.289
Jews or a great percentage of
Jews survived the war.

00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:02.042
In all, only twenty-four
percent of the Jews were

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:04.966
deported, as opposed to
seventy-eight percent in the

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:07.490
Netherlands and forty-five from
Belgium,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.990
and ultimately fifty percent
from Hungary.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.801
Now, there's another thing
going on too,

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:16.274
just look at the map.
There's nowhere to hide in the

00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:19.320
Netherlands or in Belgium,
basically;

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.633
in Belgium, it's flat,
there's no--and I'll give you

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:29.046
some examples of where Jews were
saved because of geographic kind

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:35.559
of donné,
the lay of the land.

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:39.235
But such figures were marshaled
by those apologizing for the

00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:41.428
Vichy regime.
And to repeat something

00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:44.437
that--borrowing from Robert
Paxton that I said the other

00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:47.829
day,
Vichy might have saved the

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:52.342
French state,
in quotes, but it lost the

00:10:52.342 --> 00:10:56.720
French nation.
Now what about resistance?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.600
Well, first of all what about
Mitterrand?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.659
François Mitterrand was
the President of France between

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:10.520
1981, May of 1981,
and see he would've been

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.600
out--1981, '91.
Was '91 the end of his term?

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.925
I can't remember.
No, it was fourteen years,

00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:21.679
it should be '81 to '95;
and now the term is five years.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:27.476
François Mitterrand was
a socialist who started out his

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:32.798
term in 1981 with lots of
socialist economic policies and

00:11:32.798 --> 00:11:37.883
sort of backed up off from them,
but became somebody who was

00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:41.136
extremely popular in France.
And as he was dying,

00:11:41.136 --> 00:11:45.096
toward the very end of his
life, maybe a year before he

00:11:45.096 --> 00:11:48.029
died-- he had a very serious
illness.

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:50.389
The journalists knew it and
unlike the journalists in the

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:52.284
United States,
where something like that would

00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:54.990
be leaked immediately,
journalists did not leak this

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.379
fact, but it was quite obvious
that François Mitterrand

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:01.422
was ill.
And toward the end of his life

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:04.259
two facts about his life came
out.

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:09.113
The first is that he had a very
old daughter from a liaison that

00:12:09.113 --> 00:12:13.349
had nothing to do with his
wife--that's fairly common in

00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:16.200
political France--but the
second,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.742
and for our purposes much more
important, was that he had

00:12:19.742 --> 00:12:23.523
himself been a collaborator;
this was the dark secret and he

00:12:23.523 --> 00:12:26.507
poured out his heart.
He said he had something he had

00:12:26.507 --> 00:12:29.535
to tell--he wasn't telling
himself, but he had to tell the

00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:32.669
French people that he had
collaborated early in the war.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.387
In fact, somebody came up with
a picture of him in a rightwing

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:37.080
demonstration with the
Croix-de-Feu,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.169
or one of these groups against
immigrants, before World War II.

00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:46.141
Now, he had second thoughts
fairly early into the war and he

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.775
ends up--he heads an important
branch of the resistance

00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:53.575
organization.
But he came to grips with his

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:58.335
own past as France was
attempting to come to grips at

00:12:58.335 --> 00:13:03.210
the very same time.
Now, to the resistance.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.500
Who resisted and why did they
resist?

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.195
And again, just as the question
of collaboration was

00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:17.259
probably--and the discovery of
massive collaboration,

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:20.370
and it wasn't just a few
people, a few elites,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.480
this was the dark secret of the
dark years,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.669
as Julian Jackson called this
period.

00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.850
So is the case with the
resistance.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.294
And as I began the lecture last
time, Charles de Gaulle was

00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:36.739
determined that the France of
the Fourth Republic was to be

00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:41.636
built around his large body,
and part of that was to try to

00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:47.528
convince people in France and
abroad that the Gaullists were

00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:53.521
the only resistors and that they
had heard the crackle of his

00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:56.308
voice,
imposing voice,

00:13:56.308 --> 00:14:00.810
across the airwaves on June
18th, 1940.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.490
Now, what can we say now?
First of all,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:09.350
that the communists were
arguably the most important or

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.490
most effective resistors during
the period.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.181
And it's certainly that after
the Jews the communists suffered

00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:21.115
most.
Vichy not only handed the Nazis

00:14:21.115 --> 00:14:25.673
lists of those they arrested as
communists but also executed

00:14:25.673 --> 00:14:29.732
many of them themselves,
beginning in 1941,

00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:35.649
for no other reason than their
political affiliation.

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:38.706
Vichy's Minister of the
Interior chose communists rather

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:41.986
those he called "good" Frenchmen
to be gunned down by German

00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:45.210
firing squads in the fortress of
Mont-Valérien,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.462
outside of Paris.
Now, the socialist presence,

00:14:49.462 --> 00:14:53.593
the Socialist Party's presence
in the resistance as an

00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:56.399
organized force was not as
great.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.659
But there's several obvious
reasons for that.

00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:01.814
The communists benefited from
the fact that they had cells in

00:15:01.814 --> 00:15:04.653
virtually every commune in
France--and that's what they

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.060
called them, cell.
There are still,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.516
in our village of 300 people,
a Communist Party cell which

00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:15.972
involves basically just five or
six of our friends who are

00:15:15.972 --> 00:15:20.350
anything but the communists of
Moscow and all this,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.631
but who are defenders of those
who have no one else to defend

00:15:25.631 --> 00:15:29.679
them, and that sort of thing,
including our dear friend,

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.470
a former school teacher,
and some of our best friends in

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.457
the world.
And occasionally in my mailbox

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:40.266
I'll find an invitation from the
cell of Balazuc to a Communist

00:15:40.266 --> 00:15:45.076
Party gathering where--they've
asked me to talk on the collapse

00:15:45.076 --> 00:15:47.677
of capitalism,
and I have to explain to them

00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:49.971
that capitalism isn't probably
going to collapse in the near

00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:51.289
future,
and then we all,

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:54.308
after some political
discussion, we all drink illegal

00:15:54.308 --> 00:15:56.687
wine essentially.
There's this wine called

00:15:56.687 --> 00:15:59.730
Clinton, as in Clinton but it's
nothing to do with Clinton,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.524
that was called sort of the
vin fou a little bit,

00:16:03.524 --> 00:16:05.870
and it grows all over the
place,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.033
the grapes do,
and because it grows so wildly

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:13.419
it became sort of illegal to
produce this particular grape.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:16.268
And, so, one of the parts of
being a party of resistance is

00:16:16.268 --> 00:16:19.312
you don't pay any attention to
that, and to that extent I agree

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.378
with that.
And, so, we would drink these

00:16:21.378 --> 00:16:24.324
bottles of Clinton.
And I've drunk bottles of

00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:29.110
Clinton with a guy who joined
the party, who's still alive.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.422
He and his wife joined the
Communist Party in 1934 and he

00:16:33.422 --> 00:16:37.889
is still--he is a painter and he
painted lots of people,

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:41.702
and lots of the paintings he
had done was in prison,

00:16:41.702 --> 00:16:45.740
in Paris, and he was very lucky
to escape execution,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.700
in part because of the
complicity of a guard.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.776
And to think that they joined
the Communist Party two years

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:56.289
before the Spanish Civil War is
just incredible.

00:16:56.289 --> 00:16:59.773
So, the point of this is that
the advantage the Communist

00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:02.759
Party had is that they already
have organized,

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:06.759
they have people in most every
large village who represent the

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.621
Communist Party.
So, it's easy to organize your

00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:13.040
comrades, because you know who
they are and you can trust them

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.591
after all of these years.
So, they have some advantages

00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:18.467
there.
Another advantage the Communist

00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:21.262
Party had--and I alluded to this
before--is they were basically

00:17:21.262 --> 00:17:22.930
the party of the
cheminaux,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.509
of the railroad workers and the
engineers.

00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:30.114
In any station you go to--go to
Rouen sometime,

00:17:30.114 --> 00:17:32.741
where I teach;
and I go to Rouen often because

00:17:32.741 --> 00:17:35.796
we have friends there--and look
in the railroad station,

00:17:35.796 --> 00:17:38.980
it's just unbelievable.
There's this huge plaque with

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.079
about 200 names of
cheminaux,

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:44.658
of railroad workers,
in the largest sense,

00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:49.579
who were killed,
executed by the Nazis or by the

00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:55.200
French fascists during the war.
In every railroad station.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.706
So, the advantage there is
that--you know this from seeing

00:17:57.706 --> 00:18:00.476
all these movies I'm sure about
the resistance--it's pretty easy

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:03.954
to blow up railroad tracks.
And, so, what they were able to

00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:08.046
do is blow up--how can you watch
the whole train line between

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.160
Dijon, and Lyon,
and Marseilles,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.320
for example?
There was no TGV,

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.439
obviously, that just started on
the 28th of September,

00:18:15.439 --> 00:18:18.462
1981,
so it's easy for a couple of

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:21.015
les gars,
of the guys,

00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:24.480
to go out and to blow up the
track,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.119
and it takes a long time to fix
the track, and they blow up that

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:28.880
one and they fix that one and
then boom,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.867
further on down the line.
So, they were very active in

00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:36.206
the north, in Lille,
Roubaix, Tourcoing,

00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:41.015
Lyon, un peu partout.
And they were very much part of

00:18:41.015 --> 00:18:44.560
the CGT, that is the General
Confederation of Labor,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.940
and they were more apt to be
communist than any other party;

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:54.579
and this is true in the suburbs
of Paris as well.

00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:59.838
So, they also had great
strength among metallurgical

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:06.335
workers, and thus metallurgical
workers have access to flammable

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:10.509
explosive materials,
and this sort of stuff.

00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:15.598
And, so, they also organized
very damaging industrial

00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:20.425
strikes, particularly in 1944,
and these strikes help give

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:23.752
people a sense of hope,
that there is light at the end

00:19:23.752 --> 00:19:26.193
of the tunnel.
And of course there'd be people

00:19:26.193 --> 00:19:28.010
listening to BBC and that sort
of thing.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.036
A story about BBC, two stories.
Again, I hate to keep referring

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.867
to this village but I wrote a
book on this village called

00:19:34.867 --> 00:19:37.849
The Stones of Balazuc and
at the end of it--well,

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:40.490
one of the last chapters is
about the school,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.970
but I had to cover--do Vichy
and I had to do Vichy very,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.099
very delicately,
very delicately.

00:19:46.099 --> 00:19:48.802
It was obvious that in our
village that the priest had--we

00:19:48.802 --> 00:19:51.599
don't have a priest anymore
there--but that the priest was a

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.970
Pétainist and lots of
people hated him,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.058
not just because of his
politics, but a lot of people

00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:58.067
liked his politics,
but he used to sort of shout at

00:19:58.067 --> 00:20:00.397
people in the confessional and
there was all sorts of funny

00:20:00.397 --> 00:20:02.635
stories,
and he insisted that women sit

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:05.930
on one side of the church still
and that men on the other.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.064
But this is a village that
wasn't an area of great

00:20:10.064 --> 00:20:14.535
resistance, even though arms
were parachuted down on a

00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:18.838
plateau near where we live--this
is down here in the

00:20:18.838 --> 00:20:22.671
Ardèche.
But there were two people in

00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:26.720
the resistance and one is still
alive, a very old man,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.084
and they would hide
things--this is the pays

00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:31.089
calcaire,
it's limestone country,

00:20:31.089 --> 00:20:33.784
and big grottes,
caves along the river,

00:20:33.784 --> 00:20:36.240
and you could hide things
easily there.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.711
And I wanted to talk to this
man about the resistance and

00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:45.342
I--he's the uncle of a friend,
and finally I invited he and

00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:48.064
his wife over.
And I made clear that I wanted

00:20:48.064 --> 00:20:50.333
to ask him some questions,
not as a journalist but I'd

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.859
been there in this place for
twenty years and I knew the guy

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:56.720
a little bit,
and above all I knew his family.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.185
And he said yes he would come,
and he would talk to me about

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:00.690
it because I'd been there so
long,

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.351
but then he never showed up,
he didn't want to talk about

00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:08.143
it, he couldn't talk about it
because of--it's sort of like

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.890
people coming back from World
War One.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.089
The people that talked and
boasted were the ones who would

00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:17.569
dress up in military uniforms
when towns had been liberated,

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.478
as if they had been there in
the beginning,

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:21.250
out in the bushes,
the maquis,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.484
the resistors.
But he was a real one but he

00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:25.531
didn't want to talk about it.
But I also knew,

00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:28.141
speaking of BBC,
and this is the transition,

00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:31.480
that I'd heard this story that
a man in Balazuc had,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.397
in this particular village,
had alerted the authorities,

00:21:35.397 --> 00:21:39.244
the Vichy authorities to the
fact that some people were

00:21:39.244 --> 00:21:42.604
listening to BBC.
Now, you could be executed for

00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:45.339
listening to BBC--that was a
capital crime.

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:48.473
And often they wouldn't,
if you were somebody they knew

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.619
they wouldn't do that,
or whatever.

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:54.932
But you denounced somebody for
listening to BBC and

00:21:54.932 --> 00:21:59.848
that's--it's not as bad as
denouncing somebody saying he's

00:21:59.848 --> 00:22:04.164
a Jew, but it ain't good.
So, I asked this friend of

00:22:04.164 --> 00:22:07.305
mine, an older man who could
remember the war,

00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:10.655
and I said what about that?
And I waited for the

00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:13.039
appropriate circumstances to ask
him.

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.176
He said, "no,
no, it's just--don't pay any

00:22:15.176 --> 00:22:17.000
attention to it,
it's just rumor,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.666
it's just rumor,
it's a vicious rumor--les

00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:22.090
â€˜on dit',
rumor, les bruits,

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.092
rumors," and all that.
So, in French,

00:22:25.092 --> 00:22:27.200
j'ai bien
serpenté,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.769
I kind of snuck around a little
bit,

00:22:29.769 --> 00:22:33.710
serpented around,
and I asked some trusted people

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.829
who are very discreet what about
it?

00:22:36.829 --> 00:22:39.627
And it turned out it was his
father, it was his father,

00:22:39.627 --> 00:22:42.321
who did it, and who was
associated with the priest in

00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:44.086
the village.
And I knew this man,

00:22:44.086 --> 00:22:46.380
he died a long time ago,
ten or fifteen years ago,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.530
but I knew the man.
And such secrets,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.222
are they best buried?
I buried it in the French

00:22:52.222 --> 00:22:55.630
edition of my book,
it's not in that;

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.210
it's not in the Dutch edition,
either.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.662
It's in the English edition but
hidden away, because he'll never

00:23:01.662 --> 00:23:05.619
know, never see and couldn't
read the English edition.

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:09.535
So, all this stuff it's kind of
delicate, that whole business

00:23:09.535 --> 00:23:12.894
about--anyway.
So, people, the Communist Party

00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:17.298
became the party of the 75,000
martyrs because probably that

00:23:17.298 --> 00:23:22.248
many communists died,
whereas the socialists had a

00:23:22.248 --> 00:23:29.128
lack of structural organization
and many of their leaders like

00:23:29.128 --> 00:23:34.628
Léon Blum were in jail.
And as I said last time,

00:23:34.628 --> 00:23:37.665
just in passing,
there also was a leftwing

00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:40.617
Catholic resistance,
social Catholics,

00:23:40.617 --> 00:23:44.211
and no resistance publication
condemned racism and

00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:48.466
anti-Semitism with the vigor of
the newspaper Temoignage

00:23:48.466 --> 00:23:52.690
Chrétien,
or Christian Witness, basically.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:58.632
So, what about Jews?
It's hard to resist if you're

00:23:58.632 --> 00:24:03.390
being tracked down and being
arrested, it's--and by the way,

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.674
remember Pierre Laval who was
the Prime Minister through much

00:24:06.674 --> 00:24:10.094
of the period,
he was on another occasion when

00:24:10.094 --> 00:24:15.265
the Germans insisted that French
parents, that French adults who

00:24:15.265 --> 00:24:19.369
were Jews be transported from a
certain sector,

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:22.264
but they didn't ask for the
children, Pierre Laval said

00:24:22.264 --> 00:24:25.007
"send the children,
too"--famille,

00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:28.552
travail,
patrie--I mean that in a

00:24:28.552 --> 00:24:31.344
very ironic sense,
family, work,

00:24:31.344 --> 00:24:35.771
country--family values,
put the children together,

00:24:35.771 --> 00:24:40.740
and so the children bounced off
in the railroad car.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.531
But in fact I know this
Australian guy who was a young,

00:24:44.531 --> 00:24:47.339
very young man,
in Paris who's Jewish,

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:51.427
a guy called Jacques Adler,
and I met him in Melbourne a

00:24:51.427 --> 00:24:54.400
few years ago and he survived
the war,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.843
but he was sixteen,
he was in an underground Jewish

00:24:56.843 --> 00:24:59.630
resistance group in Paris and he
wrote a book about it.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.519
Then he went off and he made a
lot of money in Melbourne.

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:07.170
He got out, he survived,
he became a cake producer.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.049
And then he went back and he
got his Ph.D.

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.914
in French history at the
University of Melbourne with my

00:25:11.914 --> 00:25:14.414
friend Peter McPhee,
and then he wrote this book,

00:25:14.414 --> 00:25:16.809
a very good book on the Jewish
resistance.

00:25:16.809 --> 00:25:20.417
But Jewish resistance was
organized in Paris where there

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:24.549
were lots of Jews and had every
conceivable reason to resist,

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:27.304
but only in cities like
Bordeaux where they're all

00:25:27.304 --> 00:25:30.789
getting locked up very quickly
and in Lyon and other places.

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:33.858
So, but, the reason that I
insist on this fact,

00:25:33.858 --> 00:25:37.059
that there was an organized
Jewish resistance,

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:40.169
is because among the sort of
anti-Semitic residuals in the

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:43.059
post-war period is the
accusation that the Jews didn't

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:44.941
resist,
they just kind of went off to

00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:47.549
be slaughtered and all of that,
and didn't put up a fight,

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:50.869
which of course is obviously
not true.

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:55.362
Now, the role of Protestants
has been often privileged in

00:25:55.362 --> 00:26:00.043
discussion of the resistance.
Again, to repeat what I said,

00:26:00.043 --> 00:26:04.128
the great percentage of
Protestants are down here again

00:26:04.128 --> 00:26:07.230
in the Ardèche and in the
Gers,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.129
down here, in the
Cévennes mountains,

00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:11.285
basically;
also up in the Drôme

00:26:11.285 --> 00:26:14.378
on the other side of the--in the
valleys that go down to the

00:26:14.378 --> 00:26:16.423
Rhône River,
into the Drôme,

00:26:16.423 --> 00:26:19.551
d-r-o-m-e.
And the most famous case of

00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:24.839
Jewish children being saved is
that of a Protestant village,

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:31.156
which I'm going to write on the
board because it deserves it,

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:36.129
called Le Chambon-sur-Lignon,
right on the edge of the

00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:38.764
Ardèche,
near Le Puy but in the

00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:41.141
mountains.
And what they did in this

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:44.392
little teeny village is they
organized this kind of false

00:26:44.392 --> 00:26:47.410
identification network and they
took Jewish kids from

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.772
Saint-Étienne,
and Lyon, and other places in

00:26:50.772 --> 00:26:54.541
that region--that region is an
area that always sent lots of

00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:57.480
immigrants to--it's a very
Catholic region,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.005
but in this case in that
village very Protestant--had

00:27:01.005 --> 00:27:05.210
sent lots of immigrants to Lyon
and to Saint-Étienne.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:10.349
And, so, they adopted all sorts
of Jewish kids.

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:12.912
And then when the Germans would
come through,

00:27:12.912 --> 00:27:16.057
you could hear them coming,
they would hide the kids or

00:27:16.057 --> 00:27:19.405
they'd go off into the woods.
But there seemed to be an awful

00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:21.519
lot of kids and the Germans
would go through,

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:23.036
my God, these people must be
very Catholic,

00:27:23.036 --> 00:27:24.590
they're having babies all over
the place,

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.009
look at all these kids;
and they never figured it out,

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:30.660
the fact that they were
Protestant.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.845
And lots of people were saved
and there's a documentary on

00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:36.974
this.
A guy called Rod Kedward,

00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:39.041
H.R.
Kedward, has done two really

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:43.045
interesting books on--probably
the best books on the resistance

00:27:43.045 --> 00:27:46.437
that are in English.
And he noted something very

00:27:46.437 --> 00:27:50.056
interesting about a commune,
a couple of villages in the

00:27:50.056 --> 00:27:53.940
Cévennes mountains in
which protestants resisted,

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.615
and he noticed that in that
part of France the religious

00:27:56.615 --> 00:27:58.833
wars had been--in the sixteenth,
seventeenth,

00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:01.370
and eighteenth century--had
been very bloody and they'd

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.390
pitted basically the armies of
the king,

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.715
of the most Catholic king,
against--well,

00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:09.319
you know that's the title that
they called the Spanish king,

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:12.617
but anyway--of Louis XIV and
all these people,

00:28:12.617 --> 00:28:15.578
against protestants.
And he noticed that one

00:28:15.578 --> 00:28:19.215
particularly resistant village
that there was this huge mission

00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:22.675
cross overlooking the village
that had been planted there in

00:28:22.675 --> 00:28:25.960
the sixteenth century as a sign
of--or in the seventeenth

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.228
century,
I don't know which war it

00:28:28.228 --> 00:28:31.226
was--as a sign of victory,
of conquest by the State and

00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:33.779
the Catholic Church over these
protestants.

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:37.717
Does looking at something like
that all the time make you more

00:28:37.717 --> 00:28:41.267
want to resist a regime that's
closely tied to rightwing

00:28:41.267 --> 00:28:43.139
Catholicism?
Well, who knows,

00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:45.395
but Protestants were
over-represented in the

00:28:45.395 --> 00:28:47.150
resistance.
But, as I said,

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.688
Catholics resisted too,
and from the point of view of

00:28:50.688 --> 00:28:54.430
the resistance or I suppose
anybody looking at this,

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:59.557
it's easy to denounce many
Catholic archbishops and bishops

00:28:59.557 --> 00:29:04.949
who didn't give one damn about
the Jews and who embraced Vichy

00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:09.343
with a great passion.
But yet, in many places of

00:29:09.343 --> 00:29:13.710
Catholic--of villages that had
Catholics resisting,

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.627
and most people in France are
nominally Catholics,

00:29:16.627 --> 00:29:18.950
the role of priests was
considerable,

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.578
and the role of teachers
were--of instits,

00:29:22.578 --> 00:29:27.299
of primary school teachers,
was important as well.

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:30.427
Now, priests,
I don't know what you--priests

00:29:30.427 --> 00:29:34.864
and school teachers are kind of
opinion makers or whatever the

00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:37.558
phase is;
they are people that,

00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:41.554
along with the mayor,
that sort out problems in a

00:29:41.554 --> 00:29:45.084
village.
And so if you have a priest who

00:29:45.084 --> 00:29:49.808
says enough of this stuff,
he can throw his weight and do

00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:53.486
good things--well,
again, look at Père

00:29:53.486 --> 00:29:55.539
Jean, Father John,
tonight.

00:29:55.539 --> 00:30:04.457
So, again the situation of the
Catholic Church is extremely

00:30:04.457 --> 00:30:09.005
complicated.
And the real explosion of work

00:30:09.005 --> 00:30:13.237
on the resistance has been
dominated by the stories of

00:30:13.237 --> 00:30:17.230
ordinary people taking very
unordinary choices,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.458
big-time choices.
A friend of mine called John

00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:22.920
Sweets who taught at University
of Kansas, at KU,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.837
he did a book on
Clairmont-Ferrand because that's

00:30:25.837 --> 00:30:29.301
where The Sorrow and the
Pity had--the town that it

00:30:29.301 --> 00:30:32.320
had been focused on,
and his book is called

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.323
Choices in Vichy France.
And he was not critical of

00:30:36.323 --> 00:30:40.591
Paxton, which is the canon after
all, but he argued that you have

00:30:40.591 --> 00:30:44.593
to give them a wider description
of--or a wider definition of

00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:47.461
resistance,
in trying to determine how many

00:30:47.461 --> 00:30:49.814
people resisted.
Paxton thinks that about two

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.910
percent of the French population
resisted.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.862
John Sweets thinks--and it's a
very good book,

00:30:54.862 --> 00:30:58.209
Choices in Vichy
France--thinks that oh maybe

00:30:58.209 --> 00:31:00.900
about--I can't remember what he
says,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.280
eighteen or twenty percent of
the population resisted.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.484
Well, what is resistance?
Lots of people took big-time

00:31:07.484 --> 00:31:10.602
chances, smuggling weapons;
you're going to get killed if

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:11.722
they catch you,
you're gone,

00:31:11.722 --> 00:31:14.089
toast, finished.
But if you're in a movie

00:31:14.089 --> 00:31:16.786
theater and they're doing
the--showing the

00:31:16.786 --> 00:31:20.602
documentary--before the film
there's always this two minute

00:31:20.602 --> 00:31:24.549
news session which I can
remember as a tiny little boy,

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:28.175
with always the same kind of
voices giving the news,

00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:32.369
and this would be the German
news translated into French.

00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:35.696
And if you whistle and you
boo--whistling is booing in

00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:39.713
France--or if you refuse to step
off the sidewalk to let a German

00:31:39.713 --> 00:31:43.226
officer pass,
that itself is a passive

00:31:43.226 --> 00:31:47.069
resistance.
And so certainly more people

00:31:47.069 --> 00:31:52.589
resisted, according to this
definition, than--and this was a

00:31:52.589 --> 00:31:57.463
type of choice in Vichy France.
One of the ways that people

00:31:57.463 --> 00:31:59.031
resisted was,
for example,

00:31:59.031 --> 00:32:02.230
passing these printed--these
newspapers that sort of

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.343
mimeographed.
And there was a whole

00:32:04.343 --> 00:32:07.105
clandestine press and it was
very important because it would

00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:09.492
tell people in Normandy that
there'd been strikes in

00:32:09.492 --> 00:32:12.193
Saint-Étienne,
or strikes in Marseilles,

00:32:12.193 --> 00:32:15.814
or it would give news on where
people thought that the battles

00:32:15.814 --> 00:32:18.009
were going and that kind of
thing.

00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:19.500
How do you get newspapers
around?

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.758
Well you just take a bunch of
them, on a bus--a bus in Lyon,

00:32:22.758 --> 00:32:25.134
for example,
and the bus is going around the

00:32:25.134 --> 00:32:28.282
Place Bellecour and you just
hold your hand out the window

00:32:28.282 --> 00:32:31.452
and drop all the leaflets.
Or there'd be leaflets

00:32:31.452 --> 00:32:35.022
against--when the Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra played in

00:32:35.022 --> 00:32:38.519
Lyon somebody did that,
they took all these little

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:42.480
handwritten and mimeographed
pieces of paper that said,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.647
non, don't go assist,
don't go listen to the Berlin

00:32:45.647 --> 00:32:47.869
Philharmonic,
let us resist--and that's a

00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:50.856
form of resistance too,
not going to hear the Berlin

00:32:50.856 --> 00:32:53.610
Philharmonic;
phew, and dropped them just

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.038
like that.
And Lyon was a very effective

00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:58.564
center of the resistance.
I told you about Marc Bloch

00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:00.854
there, because in Lyon there are
these things called en

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:04.748
français traboules,
which are basically not tunnels

00:33:04.748 --> 00:33:09.553
but they're passages that began
in the sixteenth century to

00:33:09.553 --> 00:33:12.950
protect raw silk from being
rained on,

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.638
in a pretty rainy climate.
And, so, the traboules

00:33:16.638 --> 00:33:20.273
also go up the Croix Russe which
is this old working class

00:33:20.273 --> 00:33:24.289
neighborhood that was outside,
only annexed to Lyon in 1852.

00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:26.385
And these traboules,
you can duck into these

00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:28.314
traboules,
and that's why the resistance

00:33:28.314 --> 00:33:31.332
was so important in Lyon,
and that's where Marc Bloch

00:33:31.332 --> 00:33:34.069
went when Marc Bloch had gone
down here.

00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:37.301
He was up near Gerais here and
he's just kind of anxious and he

00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:40.634
says I should go do something,
so he goes to Lyon and he

00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:44.497
participates in the resistance
and of course he pays for it

00:33:44.497 --> 00:33:47.309
with his life.
What about women?

00:33:47.309 --> 00:33:52.135
Now, for decades nobody paid
attention to the role of women

00:33:52.135 --> 00:33:56.499
in the resistance.
Now, women were very rare in

00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:59.052
the hills.
By the way, the term

00:33:59.052 --> 00:34:02.859
maquis means basically
organized resistors.

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:05.723
A maquis in French,
or les maquis,

00:34:05.723 --> 00:34:08.405
is kind of a brush,
that's a very thick brush

00:34:08.405 --> 00:34:11.939
behind which you can hide in
Corsica--that's where it comes

00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:15.458
from originally;
and then in the south of France

00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:18.480
on what you call in French the
aride,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.359
really dry, rocky countryside.
And, so, by 1943,

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:26.486
by the end of 1943 in many
parts of France the

00:34:26.486 --> 00:34:30.269
maquis rule by night,
that they have

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:34.092
increasing--their forces are
swollen by people moving into

00:34:34.092 --> 00:34:38.152
the resistance.
Now, some people had to feed

00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:44.266
these folks, some people had to
darn their socks or knit them

00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:47.979
things to stay warm.
Some people had to pass

00:34:47.979 --> 00:34:51.432
messages, and there are all
sorts of stories about women on

00:34:51.432 --> 00:34:54.826
bicycles--it's one of these sort
of things that you see in

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:58.160
movies-- but of women on
bicycles sort of charming--young

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.613
women charming the guards if
they have the bad luck to fall

00:35:01.613 --> 00:35:04.768
upon the militia or German
guards and having a written

00:35:04.768 --> 00:35:07.569
message,
which is a terrible idea,

00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:11.376
but at least they'd have a
verbal communication of passing

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:14.381
messages into the hills.
Now, the largest resistance

00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:16.339
movement and most effective in
Europe by far,

00:35:16.339 --> 00:35:18.630
de loin,
is in ex-Yugoslavia,

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.880
and that's because of the
terrain in Bosnia-Herzegovina,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.983
in Croatia, and in Serbia,
and they have entire divisions

00:35:26.983 --> 00:35:30.060
with hospitals,
mobile hospitals and all of

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.794
that,
with the British parachuting

00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:34.764
things in.
But if you look at this map

00:35:34.764 --> 00:35:37.460
it's not surprising to see why
there's very little resistance,

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.578
again here, so where are you
going to hide,

00:35:39.578 --> 00:35:41.880
there's nowhere to hide.
So, the maquis,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.448
the resistance--there are
maquis all over the place

00:35:44.448 --> 00:35:47.667
but it's easier in the south,
and it's by the end of '43 that

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:51.049
the--and I said last time about
find a K on your door in the

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:54.003
morning,
where someone was there to put

00:35:54.003 --> 00:35:57.719
K on the door in the morning,
and there you go.

00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:02.194
And, so, the role of women has
been much more important than

00:36:02.194 --> 00:36:06.442
people had thought and there are
all sorts of wide--a big

00:36:06.442 --> 00:36:09.370
literature,
or a growing literature,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.418
on this now.
And also in some places,

00:36:11.418 --> 00:36:12.811
in Auvèrgne,
for example,

00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:14.429
the numbers of
maquisards,

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:17.942
of people in the resistance,
of maquis,

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.830
was swollen by refugees from
Spain,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.736
or even from Poland.
So, you have these people

00:36:24.736 --> 00:36:29.487
living out there.
And only three times in France

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:35.784
during the period did they try
to take on German military units

00:36:35.784 --> 00:36:40.659
in a pitched battle--bad idea,
terrible idea.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:43.570
One is right near
Clermont-Ferrand,

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.943
here.
One is in the Vercors,

00:36:45.943 --> 00:36:48.039
near Grenoble,
down here.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.690
And the third,
I don't remember where it is.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:55.579
So, that doesn't work very well
because they don't have the kind

00:36:55.579 --> 00:36:59.600
of big time tanks and that kind
of thing.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.114
But they were able to regroup.
There are places--near us

00:37:02.114 --> 00:37:04.579
there's a village way up in the
hill, God, it's so beautiful,

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:08.842
a church, this fabulous church,
at a place called Tende with

00:37:08.842 --> 00:37:11.660
this Romanesque
portée,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.087
entryway, that's just fabulous.
And there, there was a whole

00:37:16.087 --> 00:37:18.280
bunch of these people up there
and they had some fairly

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.595
considerable arms--this isn't
the pitched battle--but then

00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:22.730
they get denounced;
there are always people that

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.342
are going to sell other people's
lives away, there's no question

00:37:25.342 --> 00:37:27.126
about it.
There were true believers in

00:37:27.126 --> 00:37:29.974
the regime that's going to sell
people away, and the next thing

00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:31.949
they know--and another case near
us too,

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:35.281
the next thing they know bam,
here come the parachutists are

00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:38.556
coming in there and the tanks
are rolling up or the smaller

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:41.709
vehicles with machineguns,
real big machineguns and this

00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:43.320
kind of stuff,
and they are gone,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.980
they are just massacred.
And there are all sorts of

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.579
places around where we live
where people were shot.

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:50.306
And if you helped,
if you were a woman or you

00:37:50.306 --> 00:37:51.639
were--anyone,
you were a priest,

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:56.271
you were a--you're anyone,
you're a schoolteacher and you

00:37:56.271 --> 00:38:00.684
help people and they catch you,
and particularly if you've

00:38:00.684 --> 00:38:02.497
killed a German,
you're gone,

00:38:02.497 --> 00:38:04.750
that's it.
I told you the story about the

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.289
woman the other day who was a
collaborator up along the

00:38:07.289 --> 00:38:09.640
Rhône River and they blew
her brains out,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.271
the resistors did.
And in penance,

00:38:13.271 --> 00:38:16.880
as it were, in punishment,
they just execute people,

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.639
just take hostages and execute
them;

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:22.784
begin with people you think are
Communist and then just shoot

00:38:22.784 --> 00:38:25.710
the other people.
Look what happened in the Czech

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.747
Republic in ex-Czechoslovakia.
In Prague I've gone to the

00:38:28.747 --> 00:38:31.218
place where Richard Heydrich,
who was one of the very worst

00:38:31.218 --> 00:38:34.260
of the worst,
was assassinated by Czech

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.360
maquis and he's gunned
down as he's coming in,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.165
and he fights them,
and he's finally mortally

00:38:41.165 --> 00:38:44.095
wounded and all that.
And they go and they hide in

00:38:44.095 --> 00:38:48.634
this church that I went to visit
in Prague a couple of years ago,

00:38:48.634 --> 00:38:51.329
and they of course perish
horribly.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:53.776
But they took an entire village
called Lidice and kill

00:38:53.776 --> 00:38:57.512
everybody.
It's rather like Sara Farmer's

00:38:57.512 --> 00:39:03.030
book, Oradour-sur-Glane,
which really needs no

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.594
discussion now.
Now, what led people--well,

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.372
first of all,
one quick point,

00:39:08.372 --> 00:39:11.988
is that again I've said that if
you took a map of--I've said

00:39:11.988 --> 00:39:14.685
this I guess maybe even more
recently--but of

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:19.153
de-Christianization,
allegiance to the French

00:39:19.153 --> 00:39:25.250
Revolution in 1790,
the elections of 1949 and 1981,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.862
you would have virtually the
same départements

00:39:27.862 --> 00:39:30.607
are Left, and virtually the same
départements are

00:39:30.607 --> 00:39:31.982
Right.
That doesn't work for the

00:39:31.982 --> 00:39:34.550
resistance.
Brittany, which has always been

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.039
extremely conservative,
was a big resistance area.

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:40.988
The same goes with rural
Normandy, and of course that's

00:39:40.988 --> 00:39:43.500
the most well known because of
the invasion,

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.024
the Americans,
and the British,

00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:46.752
and the Australians,
and everybody,

00:39:46.752 --> 00:39:50.320
New Zealanders and Canadians,
invade here.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.493
The Germans thought they were
going to invade here but they

00:39:53.493 --> 00:39:56.289
invade here.
And the resistance had already

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:59.739
taken out lots of rail lines and
things like that,

00:39:59.739 --> 00:40:02.118
and General Eisenhower said
that they were worth two

00:40:02.118 --> 00:40:03.750
divisions or something like
that.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.699
Rural Normandy has always been
conservative.

00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:10.269
So, that interpretation doesn't
really work.

00:40:10.269 --> 00:40:13.751
There was lots of resistance in
Auvergne, which is conservative,

00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:16.570
and there was tons of
resistance in the Limousin,

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.947
thus explaining--one reason
explaining the massacre on the

00:40:20.947 --> 00:40:22.560
10th of June,
1944,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.050
or Oradour-sur-Glane.
So, you can't--there's no kind

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:33.000
of geographic determinism,
regional determinism.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.968
There is some geographic
determinism that is the lay of

00:40:35.968 --> 00:40:38.551
the land, but there's no
regional--there's not a

00:40:38.551 --> 00:40:40.970
predisposition of Bretons not to
resist,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.827
because they do resist.
They resist--not everybody,

00:40:43.827 --> 00:40:47.661
but the resistance is important
in Brittany and these kinds of

00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:50.356
places.
Now, without question the big

00:40:50.356 --> 00:40:54.488
defining moment swelling the
ranks of the resistance is the

00:40:54.488 --> 00:40:57.409
service du travail
obligatoire;

00:40:57.409 --> 00:41:01.255
in February,
the STO, that is the service of

00:41:01.255 --> 00:41:05.994
obligatory work where the
Germans say we want men from

00:41:05.994 --> 00:41:11.269
each region to go to Germany and
work in the factories.

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:15.045
The reason is they have so many
people dead, so many killed,

00:41:15.045 --> 00:41:18.769
and they need work.
And this swells the ranks of

00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:24.039
resistors, this forces families
and individuals to make choices

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:27.695
in Vichy France,
again to borrow from John's

00:41:27.695 --> 00:41:32.214
title.
This builds on a policy in June

00:41:32.214 --> 00:41:39.500
'42 announced by Pierre Laval
called the relève,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.505
or the relief team that would
send specialized French workers

00:41:44.505 --> 00:41:49.594
to Germany, in exchange for the
release of French prisoners of

00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:53.044
war from 1940--ha ha.
But now they say,

00:41:53.044 --> 00:41:57.138
"well, you got to go," and
they'll show up into your

00:41:57.138 --> 00:42:00.429
village and you better be ready
to go.

00:42:00.429 --> 00:42:06.469
650,000 workers were sent to
Germany as conscript labor.

00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:12.922
This also contributes to
discredit further the Vichy

00:42:12.922 --> 00:42:18.110
regime vis-à-vis its
population,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.845
and the grumbling about
Pétain,

00:42:20.845 --> 00:42:24.985
the grumbling about shortages
and the grumbling about the

00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:29.199
German soldiers give way now to
more open resentment.

00:42:29.199 --> 00:42:32.319
The Bishop of Lille,
a guy called Cardinale

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:35.588
Léonarde,
who had kept quiet about the

00:42:35.588 --> 00:42:39.970
increasingly obvious fate of
Jews announced it was no longer

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:44.130
a duty for a Christian to go to
work in Germany--merci

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:48.652
monsieur.
And, so, this swells this

00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:55.170
nomadic tribe of resistors
living from day to day in the

00:42:55.170 --> 00:43:00.623
mountains and the hills.
And it's a scary existence,

00:43:00.623 --> 00:43:04.880
you're listening through the
night, or in the day,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.739
for the roar of machines,
the roar of the rival airplanes

00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:16.482
or of fast speeding German cars,
and you're freezing in snow,

00:43:16.482 --> 00:43:20.005
bored, tired,
anxious, far,

00:43:20.005 --> 00:43:27.320
far away, demoralized and
understandably terrified.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.168
Now, most of the maquis
were city folks,

00:43:31.168 --> 00:43:39.066
they were the majority.
And most of France is not urban

00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:46.032
people in 1943 and 1944.
That was because it was easier

00:43:46.032 --> 00:43:50.826
to round up people to be sent in
the STO, that is the obligatory

00:43:50.826 --> 00:43:54.264
labor service,
if you were from a city where

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:58.849
you had all sorts of soldiers
who'd come out and pick you up.

00:43:58.849 --> 00:44:03.459
And so the Limousin probably is
the classic example,

00:44:03.459 --> 00:44:08.429
that is in the area in which
Oradour-sur-Glane takes,

00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:12.479
where it became--it was not a
mass, mass movement,

00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:17.437
but where you still have all
sorts of people that are part of

00:44:17.437 --> 00:44:23.139
underground organizations or are
part of the Gaullist resistance,

00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:25.289
and Jean Moulin--the reason I
have his name up here,

00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:27.269
he was a former prefect of the
Eure-et-Loire,

00:44:27.269 --> 00:44:30.309
which is the department of
Chartres, in the Blois,

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:33.099
south of Paris,
a beautiful cathedral town.

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:36.892
And then he ends up himself
getting denounced,

00:44:36.892 --> 00:44:39.590
and tortured,
and all of that.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.464
But the resistance,
whether they were Gaullists,

00:44:41.464 --> 00:44:42.820
or whether they were
communists,

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.031
or whether they had no
affiliation at all,

00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:47.782
pas d'affiliation,
the resistance depended on

00:44:47.782 --> 00:44:50.699
neighborhood,
small town and above all

00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:54.916
village networks;
thus the role of the school

00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:58.739
teacher or some kind of local
leader.

00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:01.695
A communist was wounded by
French gendarmes,

00:45:01.695 --> 00:45:05.063
in a village in the Var,
that is the department of

00:45:05.063 --> 00:45:06.750
Toulon,
and Saint-Tropez,

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.829
and all of that on the
Mediterranean.

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:12.708
He was hidden by a peasant in
one of these networks,

00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:16.130
but his untreated wound
developed gangrene.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.321
Two doctors took care of him,
alerted by the wife of an agent

00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:23.446
of a resistance organization.
In all, ten people combined,

00:45:23.446 --> 00:45:27.958
at the risk of their life,
of saving the life of one

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:30.663
resistor.
And, of course ironically in

00:45:30.663 --> 00:45:34.125
areas like the Limousin that if
I insisted, and I'm right in

00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:36.821
doing so,
that as Paxton and others have

00:45:36.821 --> 00:45:41.070
argued, that Vichy saw itself as
the regime of la terre,

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.472
of the land,
that the real values were Joan

00:45:43.472 --> 00:45:45.989
of Arc and peasants and all that
business.

00:45:45.989 --> 00:45:49.793
The cult of the peasant
resistor in areas like the

00:45:49.793 --> 00:45:53.519
Limousin, that is around Limoges
and at Tulle,

00:45:53.519 --> 00:45:58.030
the massacre at Tulle and all
these places,

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:03.797
was an important one as well.
Now, after the June 6th

00:46:03.797 --> 00:46:10.474
landings in Normandy--and as you
know the troops are also moving

00:46:10.474 --> 00:46:12.745
up,
after the landings in the

00:46:12.745 --> 00:46:15.559
south, are moving up the
Rhône Valley,

00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:17.980
killing lots of people on the
way.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.919
Then it became easier to resist
and so therefore the temptation

00:46:22.919 --> 00:46:26.059
after the war was to say,
oh, "moi aussi,

00:46:26.059 --> 00:46:29.304
j'étais là,"
"I was resisting and wasn't I

00:46:29.304 --> 00:46:30.960
dear?"
"Oh yes your gun was always

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.250
ready," et cetera,
et cetera.

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.489
And everybody kind of jumped
forward in Privas.

00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:38.788
In the prefecture of the
Ardèche there was--they'd

00:46:38.788 --> 00:46:43.086
have this big sort of joyous
celebration when the town is

00:46:43.086 --> 00:46:46.929
liberated and then they noticed,
some of the resistors noticed

00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:49.014
that all sorts of people had
dressed up in fancy military

00:46:49.014 --> 00:46:51.024
clothes and all of that;
they had nothing to do with the

00:46:51.024 --> 00:46:53.179
resistance at all.
Some of them were trying to

00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:56.601
save their skins because they
had rather different sympathies

00:46:56.601 --> 00:46:58.198
a few weeks ago,
before that,

00:46:58.198 --> 00:47:01.657
or a few months before that.
And as I said near our village

00:47:01.657 --> 00:47:04.707
there was a priest who was lined
up on a wall and shot down

00:47:04.707 --> 00:47:07.809
because he had--because he had
had Déat to lunch,

00:47:07.809 --> 00:47:12.239
who was a fascist,
sometime earlier in the period.

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:17.149
There were about 24,000
maquis who were killed in

00:47:17.149 --> 00:47:20.510
the liberation of France.
And in Paris,

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.969
above all, but in other cities
as well, you can walk along and

00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:29.356
you see signs that say,
"Ici est tombé,"

00:47:29.356 --> 00:47:33.500
Here Fell on the 24th of August,
1944, so-and-so,

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.820
from one of the resistance
groups.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.883
And occasionally you'll see a
flower, a new flower is put

00:47:39.883 --> 00:47:42.946
there, by somebody who remembers
or somebody aware of the

00:47:42.946 --> 00:47:45.272
collective memory;
especially around the

00:47:45.272 --> 00:47:48.063
Prefecture of Police in Paris.
I've always thought it was

00:47:48.063 --> 00:47:50.549
cruel, and this is cynical,
but they should've put in some

00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:52.119
of the fancier quarters of
Paris,

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:57.709
in Passy and places like that,
"Ici a collaboré

00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:02.900
Monsieur et Madame le Comte de
quelque chose,"

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:08.817
1940 or 1944.
But that's not nice,

00:48:08.817 --> 00:48:14.639
and not very generous,
and I make no apologies for it.

00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:19.016
There were--again,
just to end with these

00:48:19.016 --> 00:48:25.689
little--I'll just end with this,
that at the time of the Papon

00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:30.780
trial when Papon was arguing,
he says, "well I was a good

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.126
bureaucrat, my superiors liked
what I did and I was protecting

00:48:34.126 --> 00:48:37.198
these other Jews by sending away
the hundreds whom I made

00:48:37.198 --> 00:48:40.269
possible their departure from
the Gare Saint-Jean."

00:48:40.269 --> 00:48:42.781
There was another little story
that came along,

00:48:42.781 --> 00:48:44.909
and I don't remember where I
read it,

00:48:44.909 --> 00:48:49.187
but there was a young woman who
worked as a secretary in the

00:48:49.187 --> 00:48:53.030
prefecture or in the police or
somewhere like that,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.304
and she--because of people like
Papon, you had lists of all the

00:48:57.304 --> 00:49:01.510
people who were Jews or all the
people who were communists,

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:08.169
in the Gironde or in Bordeaux,
and that these things are kept

00:49:08.169 --> 00:49:10.904
in files.
But this is before the

00:49:10.904 --> 00:49:13.934
computer, the quiet violence of
the computer,

00:49:13.934 --> 00:49:17.170
and these were lists that were
done by hand,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:22.991
and she simply went into the
drawers and ripped them up,

00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:27.211
ripped up the lists,
and put the scrap paper not in

00:49:27.211 --> 00:49:30.680
the wastepaper basket but in her
pocket and went out and

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.148
deposited it in the first
poubelle or garbage can

00:49:34.148 --> 00:49:36.456
that she found.
Heroic acts,

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:40.121
choices in Vichy France--it
made you think,

00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:42.187
it made you decide what to do.

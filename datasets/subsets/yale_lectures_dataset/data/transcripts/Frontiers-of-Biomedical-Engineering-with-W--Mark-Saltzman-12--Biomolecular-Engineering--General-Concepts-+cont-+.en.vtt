00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.923
Professor Mark Saltzman:
Welcome,

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:17.230
so we're going to continue
today talking about drug

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.468
delivery.
I want to pick up where I

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:22.680
started last time,
where at the end of the class I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.482
was trying to convince you that
one way to think about drug

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:30.350
delivery was to take what we
know is a complex system,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.810
the human body,
and represent in a simple way.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.615
This is a common approach to
engineering, where you take a

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:43.000
system that might be a complex
system and you say,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.150
'How could I represent it in
the most simple way?'

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.839
Then you ask the question,
'What comes out that simple

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.440
description and does it fit
experimental evidence,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.830
does it match what we know
about how things work?'

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.169
This simplification was to
take the human body and

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:07.245
represent it as a simple stirred
vessel of water and to ask the

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:10.805
question,
'If we introduce drugs into the

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.555
body do they behave in the same
was as if I introduced drugs

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:19.340
into this well-stirred vessel
full of water,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.540
are there things that match
about it?'

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.473
We made the vessel a little bit
more complicated than a simple

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:31.650
tank full of water in that we
allow its volume to be variable.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.306
This is going to account for
the fact that when we introduce

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:38.883
drugs into the body,
some of them are going to go to

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.739
different compartments within
the body.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.085
Some will remain confined to
the blood plasma space,

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.840
for example,
while some will be distributed

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.830
more widely.
So, we'll adjust the volume of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.999
the vessel to match the drug
some way and how it's

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.730
distributed.
And we'll assume that it's a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.503
magical vessel in another sense,
and that drugs disappear and

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:03.269
they disappear in a very orderly
fashion.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.815
That is they--the rate of
disappearance of the drugs is

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.939
equal to some constant times the
concentration.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.955
It's a first-order rate of
elimination from this

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:19.701
compartment.
If we do that,

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:24.010
I wrote on the board today the
equations that are in the box at

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.860
the end of the chapter,
in Chapter 14.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.430
Just to review them very
quickly, that if we have a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.500
system like this we know that
mass has to be conserved.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.258
One way to write down the
conservation of mass equation is

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.817
like this.
The amount that comes in minus

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:43.881
the amount that goes out,
plus any molecules that are

00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:46.911
generated inside,
minus any molecules that are

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.879
consumed inside the system has
to be equal to accumulation.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.350
IN--OUT + GEN--CONS =
ACCAccumulation is just the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.795
rate of change of concentration.
If molecules are accumulating

00:02:56.795 --> 00:03:00.618
inside the vessel that means
their concentration is either

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:03.595
going up or down,
and so accumulation is the rate

00:03:03.595 --> 00:03:06.867
of change with time of the total
number of molecules inside the

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.201
vessel: -kM = dM/dt.
If we went through this

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:12.990
analysis for the system that I
drew up here,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.259
and the particular
circumstance,

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.883
that I'm going to inject drugs
into the body or into this

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:23.969
vessel at time t = 0.
After time t = 0,

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.720
no molecules are going to be
introduced.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.332
This is when I'm just giving
all the drug at once at the

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:34.009
beginning, so I'm simulating an
intravenous injection.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.173
There's nothing coming in and
there's going out over the--in

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:42.759
terms of drugs introduced over
the time that I'm interested in.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.776
No molecules of drug are being
generated inside the body but

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:50.385
they are being consumed,
they are disappearing in some

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:52.483
way.
They're disappearing by this

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.755
first-order process where the
rate of disappearance is equal

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:58.916
to a constant times the number
of molecules that are still

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.593
available (-kM).
I could solve this

00:04:01.593 --> 00:04:04.502
equation, this differential
equation--I've told you if you

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:06.902
don't know about solving
differential equations,

00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:09.834
don't worry.
Another way to think about it

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:13.394
is here's the solution,
you could convince yourself

00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:16.740
that this solution does match
this equation,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.670
'If I take the derivative of
this and plug it back in here do

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.350
I get the right answer?'
That's another way to think

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.694
about or you could just trust me
that it is the right solution to

00:04:25.694 --> 00:04:28.062
the equation.
We also have to know one more

00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:30.863
thing, how many molecules of
drug we introduced at the

00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:33.272
beginning,
and we're going to call that

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.963
number M_0 and
so the final result is M =

00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:39.240
M_0&lt;/i
&gt;*e^(-kt).

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.611
The amount of drug that I have
within the body at any time is

00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:46.379
equal to the amount I had at
time 0,

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:52.668
times e^(-kt),
where k is this rate

00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:56.089
constant.
So, if I knew what the rate

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.876
constant was,
I knew how long after the

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:02.079
injection,
I knew how many molecules I'd

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.268
injected at the beginning,
I could calculate how many I

00:05:06.268 --> 00:05:09.419
have at any time.
Another way to write this

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.893
is to write not in terms of the
total number of molecules in the

00:05:12.893 --> 00:05:15.209
body but in terms of the
concentration.

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:19.634
To get concentration,
I just divide both sides by the

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:22.642
volume.
So, concentration in the body's

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:25.970
function of time is equal to
this expression.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.589
I've plotted that for you last
time and that plot's shown here.

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:34.411
If I looked on a simple plot of
concentration versus time,

00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:38.302
concentration starts at a
maximum and it drops,

00:05:38.302 --> 00:05:41.769
and it drops exponentially over
time.

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.443
Turns out this very simple
model matches very well the way

00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:48.860
many drugs behave if you inject
them into the body.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.897
If you inject them
intravenously,

00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:53.316
in this case,
in that the concentration

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:56.753
immediately after the injection
will be the highest and

00:05:56.753 --> 00:05:59.300
concentration will drop over
time.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.967
For many drugs the way that
they're eliminated from the body

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:07.764
does result in first-order
elimination like this,

00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:11.180
so you see this pattern.
Now, another useful

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.051
parameter to describe here is
that--is what's called the

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:16.639
half-life.
How long do drugs remain in the

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.980
body, what's the time course of
that.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.864
The half-life is defined as the
time that it takes for drug

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:26.949
concentration to drop from one
value to half of that value.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.585
It might drop from C =
C_0 down to

00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:33.966
瘠_0,
it might drop from

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:38.870
瘠_0 down to a
劍_0,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.338
from a 1/4 to an 1/8th.
It doesn't matter where you

00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:45.521
start at, for processes where
you have first-order elimination

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.704
the time to get rid of half of
the drugs that are remaining is

00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:51.917
always the same.
That's a characteristic of

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:57.094
first-order processes.
That half-life is just equal to

00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:01.130
ln(2/k).
What this plot over here shows

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.635
you is how rapidly would drugs
disappear for drugs that had

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:10.139
different half-lives or
different rates of elimination?

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.773
It's plotted on a semi-log plot
so this is the natural--this is

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:21.407
the log_10 actually of
drug concentration in the body

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:25.392
as a function of time.
Here's a drug that has a

00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:28.909
half-life of 600 minutes;
long half-life means it stays

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.733
in the body for a long time you
clear it--you get rid of it very

00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:34.767
slowly.
A shorter half-life you get rid

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:37.291
of more quickly;
a very short half-life you get

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.690
rid of very quickly.
What's the result of that?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.372
That for drugs with a short
half-life, drugs that the body

00:07:45.372 --> 00:07:49.811
gets rid of more rapidly,
if the desired effect isn't

00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:54.089
achieved with one dose I have to
give another dose.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:58.418
I'd have to give another dose
if the drug had a half-life of

00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:02.453
six minutes, I'd have to give
another dose when the drug

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:06.708
concentration dropped down to a
very low level if I want to

00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:11.956
maintain a high concentration.
Knowing the half-life is really

00:08:11.956 --> 00:08:16.834
important and when you--we'll
see in a minute here how this

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:20.029
same factor is important for
drugs,

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:24.583
not just that are intravenously
injected but for drugs that are

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:27.752
taken by pills as well.
This is something that if

00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:30.470
you're making a drug,
or you're making it to sell,

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.116
you need to know about because
you need to tell people how

00:08:34.116 --> 00:08:36.419
frequently they can take the
drug.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.080
That depends on how quickly
your body gets rid of it.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.259
That'll be more clear in just a
moment, I hope.

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:45.488
That's the simplest,
possible model,

00:08:45.488 --> 00:08:48.630
and it matches very well the
behavior of many drugs when

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.419
they're injected intravenously.
How could I extend this to talk

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:55.190
about--to think about other
situations as well?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.764
Well, what's different if I
don't directly inject the

00:08:58.764 --> 00:09:02.340
molecules into the body but I
take them by a pill?

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.007
That means if this is most of
your body, now when I take a

00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:11.019
pill I'm not introducing the
drugs all at once,

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.721
but I'm putting them into my
intestinal system and they're

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.190
being slowly absorbed into the
body.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.090
One way to describe that is
to add another compartment to

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.685
the model.
To add another compartment to

00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:26.969
this simple model and say,
here is a dose,

00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:29.029
but it's a dose in form of a
pill.

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:36.048
The patient's going to swallow
it and then that drug will be

00:09:36.048 --> 00:09:42.710
available in a particular
sub-compartment of the body.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.895
Now, it's going to be in the
intestine and it will be

00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:53.480
absorbed from the intestine into
the bulk of the body,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.029
into the circulatory system
where it can distribute.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.284
Now, I'm not going to write
down the equations for this but

00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:02.640
you could do that,
and you could solve this

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.551
equation.
What you would find is this

00:10:06.551 --> 00:10:12.559
curve here which matches your
intuition, probably.

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:17.277
That what happens if I swallow
a pill and that pill dissolves

00:10:17.277 --> 00:10:21.994
in my intestinal tract and then
molecules get absorbed slowly

00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:25.742
into the body,
is that right after I take the

00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:30.330
pill the concentration hasn't
changed inside my blood yet,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.854
inside the bulk of my body.
The molecules are still

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:36.158
outside your body,
they're still in your

00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:39.781
intestinal tract.
They slowly get absorbed and as

00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.428
they absorbed concentration
rises, you can see concentration

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:48.169
rising here.
Now, what happens to those

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:52.600
molecules that are circulating
in your body?

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.375
Well, the same thing happens to
them as what would happen to

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:58.009
them if they were injected,
is that your body's trying to

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:00.116
get rid of them.
At this point here,

00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:03.985
the rate at which they're being
absorbed is much faster than the

00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:06.809
rate that your body is getting
rid of them,

00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:09.830
and so the concentration is
rising.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:16.170
It eventually reaches a peak,
most of the drug has now been

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.980
absorbed and concentrations
start to fall.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.546
What's happening during this
phase is that most of the drug

00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:27.498
has now been absorbed so the
rate at which you're

00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:30.879
getting--it's coming into your
body from the pill that's

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:34.200
dissolving and the molecules
being absorbed through the

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.889
intestinal tract is being--that
rate is less than the rate at

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:40.779
which your body is getting rid
of it,

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:45.230
and so the concentration starts
to drop.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.303
If you took Acetaminophen
or if you took Ibuprofen,

00:11:49.303 --> 00:11:53.335
which is Advil or Motrin,
what's happening in your body

00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:57.119
is that over some period of
time, usually ten minutes to

00:11:57.119 --> 00:11:59.613
half an hour,
the molecules are being

00:11:59.613 --> 00:12:02.956
absorbed from your intestine;
the concentration in your blood

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:05.315
is starting to rise.
If you took a pill and then you

00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:07.581
measured concentrations in your
blood, you'd see those

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.539
concentrations start to rise.
They reach a peak,

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:16.100
say half an hour after you take
it, and hopefully whatever aches

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.881
or pains,
or whatever the reason you're

00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:22.206
taking the medication for,
you start to feel an effect of

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:25.946
it after some of period of time
and then concentrations start to

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:28.722
fall.
Now, eventually they'll

00:12:28.722 --> 00:12:33.088
fall to such a low level that
the drug doesn't have its

00:12:33.088 --> 00:12:37.940
desired effect anymore.
In the event that your pain

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.116
hasn't gone away you'll take
another dose,

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:46.700
in which case the same events
will repeat;

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.314
drug will be absorbed,
concentration will go up and

00:12:50.314 --> 00:12:54.684
then it'll start to fall again.
What you would see on repeated

00:12:54.684 --> 00:12:58.720
doses, here I show the effect of
getting one dose at time 0,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.387
giving another dose at 120
minutes, giving a third dose at

00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:07.972
240 minutes, so this would be
taking a drug--taking pills

00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:12.486
every two hours.
Each one of the pills you take

00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:17.315
yields the same behavior.
The total concentration in your

00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:22.061
blood is just the sum of each of
those--the effect of each those

00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.485
doses.
Each of those doses would have

00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:26.870
produced what are the dotted
lines here;

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.250
the total effect that you would
see is this purple line.

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:38.271
Let's say this drug is
effective when the concentration

00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:38.930
is 0.1.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.555
Well, that means after 20
minutes or so,

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:52.414
after the first dose,
I get a level that's above 0.1

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:57.559
and I start to feel some relief
from the symptoms.

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.856
Concentrations peak,
I'm feeling good,

00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:02.692
they start to drop.
I know because I read the

00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:05.450
bottle, it said take a dose
every two hours.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.888
I take another dose at two
hours, the concentration rises

00:14:08.888 --> 00:14:11.484
again.
So, by repeating these doses

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:15.845
every two hours I maintain the
concentration over 0.1 and I

00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:19.980
have an effect from the drug
that lasts a long time.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.797
What if at 0.3,
what if at a concentration of

00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:26.919
0.3 you begin to see side
effects?

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:30.330
What if at a concentration 0.3
you begin to see side effects?

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.804
Well, no problem after the
first dose, after the second

00:14:33.804 --> 00:14:37.857
dose I've slipped into the range
where I might start to see side

00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:40.373
effects.
After the third dose I'm

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:44.659
clearly up into the range where
side effects might happen.

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:50.150
So your--there's some danger as
you repeat doses that because

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:55.458
drug is accumulating that you
could slip into a range where

00:14:55.458 --> 00:15:00.564
you start to see side effects.
Now, the reason why you

00:15:00.564 --> 00:15:05.142
can--I mentioned this last time
but it should be more clear now

00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:09.053
when you look at this picture,
the reason why you can take

00:15:09.053 --> 00:15:11.999
some drugs like Ibuprofen or
aspirin, or drugs that you

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:15.600
typically buy over the counter
without a doctor's prescription,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.187
and therefore without a
doctor's guidance on taking

00:15:18.187 --> 00:15:20.724
them.
The reason why you can buy

00:15:20.724 --> 00:15:25.908
those and use them yourself is
because toxic levels don't occur

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:30.128
until high on this chart;
side effects don't occur until

00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:33.647
high on this chart.
You can safely take it and

00:15:33.647 --> 00:15:38.529
without much risk that side
effects are going to occur.

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:41.654
For many drugs,
however, the side effects occur

00:15:41.654 --> 00:15:45.392
at lower concentrations.
Concentrations that are closer

00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:49.139
to the dose you need in order to
have a useful response.

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:51.980
Those are ones that you have to
be more careful with;

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.362
those are ones that physicians
don't want to prescribe unless

00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:58.800
they're seeing you frequently
enough that they can monitor how

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.891
well you're doing with the drug.
This should give you some idea

00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:06.340
about why that happens.

00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:12.052
People have been thinking
for a long time,

00:16:12.052 --> 00:16:14.064
we've talked about why
different modes of

00:16:14.064 --> 00:16:16.991
administration.
Oral administration is the

00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:21.617
preferred mode for almost all
kinds of drugs because it can be

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:25.275
self-administered,
it's very convenient and people

00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:27.539
don't mind taking drugs that
way.

00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:30.644
But there are problems with it,
for example,

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:34.759
this problem of how do you
maintain constant levels within

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:38.080
this safe range over long
periods of time.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.357
This just shows that same plot
again, with the levels rising

00:16:42.357 --> 00:16:46.272
and falling, with the minimum
effective and the maximum

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:49.970
tolerated concentrations shown
explicitly here.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.725
What's shown by the blue line
is sort of what you might

00:16:54.725 --> 00:16:59.744
prefer, some kind of a drug
delivery system that gives you

00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:05.116
long lasting concentrations but
concentrations that don't rise

00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:10.488
and fall in the way that they do
when you're taking individual

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:16.047
doses repeatedly.
Now, could you do this with

00:17:16.047 --> 00:17:20.848
an oral--with a pill?
Could you achieve this sort of

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:24.799
long lasting constant
concentration with a pill?

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:28.235
Well, you could in some rare
circumstances,

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:30.672
right?
Think about--how would that

00:17:30.672 --> 00:17:33.294
happen?
Well, maybe a drug has a very

00:17:33.294 --> 00:17:36.464
long half-life.
If you could design a drug that

00:17:36.464 --> 00:17:39.650
had a very, very long half-life
you could maintain

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.344
concentrations for a long time.
Nate do you have a

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:43.824
question?Student:
Aren't there now these time

00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:44.820
release
capsules?Professor Mark

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.413
Saltzman: Yes,
so let me get to that in just a

00:17:47.413 --> 00:17:49.960
minute, but that's a really good
point.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.114
An alternate to that would be
what if I had a drug that had a

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:57.230
long half-life,
well that would naturally have

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.965
this kind of a pattern.
Instead of that,

00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:06.680
what if I design a pill that
releases it slowly?

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.048
Thinking back a couple slides
ago what if I designed a pill

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.890
that was absorbed very slowly
from the intestine?

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:20.041
If I make it absorb so slowly
that drug is continually coming

00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.819
into your body over a long
period of time.

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:28.559
The peak in this diagram occurs
after only 30 minutes or so.

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:36.020
What if I designed a pill such
that the drug was absorbed over

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.592
five hours?
Then I could extend this period

00:18:40.592 --> 00:18:46.076
here and I could have drug
concentrations that remain long

00:18:46.076 --> 00:18:49.105
a long time,
this would be five hours

00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:52.740
instead of 60 minutes down here
where the peak occurs.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.180
What's the limit of that?
Why is there a limit on how far

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.885
you can go with that approach?
Justin?Student:

00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:03.097
There's only so much
drug.Professor Mark

00:19:03.097 --> 00:19:04.230
Saltzman: There's only so
much drug,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:09.185
so it might be that if you do
that then your pill is getting

00:19:09.185 --> 00:19:13.688
larger and larger presumably.
There's only so big a pill you

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:16.410
could swallow,
so that could be a problem.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.619
Most compounds fairly potent,
if you had something that was

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.718
potent you could still put
several days worth into a pill

00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:25.817
that was of a reasonable size.
That might not be the

00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:29.180
limitation for every drug but
that's a really good point.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.390
What's another limitation?

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.152
Yeah Ilya?Student:
Safety, I think that if put a

00:19:43.152 --> 00:19:46.915
[inaudible].Professor
Mark Saltzman: So that's a

00:19:46.915 --> 00:19:49.509
real--safety is a really good
point.

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:52.121
What I've been talking about
here is how these things behave

00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:54.882
in an average person.
What if you happen to absorb

00:19:54.882 --> 00:19:57.869
drug much more quickly than the
average person?

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:00.935
You've got several days worth
of drug you're taking in one

00:20:00.935 --> 00:20:03.140
pill but it gets absorbed more
quickly,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:08.015
you go into this toxic or side
effect range,

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:11.870
so safety is certainly an
issue.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.510
One more, how often do you eat?

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.080
Why?
Why don't we only eat once a

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.350
day?

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.633
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Mark

00:20:29.633 --> 00:20:30.714
Saltzman:
Sorry?Student:

00:20:30.714 --> 00:20:32.399
The breakdown of food
[inaudible].Professor

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.116
Mark Saltzman: Because
that's the rate at which you

00:20:34.116 --> 00:20:35.928
absorbed foot and that's the
rate at which your intestinal

00:20:35.928 --> 00:20:38.308
system works.
Things pass through at a

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:40.938
certain rate.
You can't really slow that

00:20:40.938 --> 00:20:44.724
down, you can't really--you can
eat more and feel full for a

00:20:44.724 --> 00:20:48.540
period of time,
feel satisfied but you can--you

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.776
won't continue to be absorbing
more drugs because whatever you

00:20:53.776 --> 00:20:59.269
take into your intestine passes
through in a matter of hours.

00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:04.517
There is a transit rate through
your intestinal system that is

00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:07.975
not very changeable.
A pill that you take is only

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:11.161
going to be there as long as
it's still in your intestinal

00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:14.180
tract and there's a limit to how
long it will last.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.884
It's not going to last forever.
We know this from our

00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:21.394
experience with food and
eliminating the waste products

00:21:21.394 --> 00:21:23.738
of food,
that there's a time course

00:21:23.738 --> 00:21:26.180
there that can't be altered very
much.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.149
There's a limit to how much you
can do in terms of sustaining or

00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:35.960
prolonging release with an oral
system so people have designed

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.876
other methods.
As I mentioned,

00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:42.893
this is my research lab,
this is my specialty so I'm

00:21:42.893 --> 00:21:47.619
going to talk about some things
that we've designed to try to

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:51.952
get around these barriers for
certain kinds of drugs and

00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:55.882
certain situations.
One way that you could get

00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:59.648
around it is by designing,
not something that's taken

00:21:59.648 --> 00:22:03.123
orally, but by designing a
delivery system that's

00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:06.091
implanted.
Now, when you start thinking

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:10.258
about 'this is not a pill but an
implant', you're automatically

00:22:10.258 --> 00:22:13.349
limiting it to certain kinds of
conditions.

00:22:13.349 --> 00:22:16.310
You wouldn't want to get an
implant for a headache or

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.930
something that you know is going
to go away.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.682
You're talking about serious
medical problems that are

00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:25.061
ongoing.
This might be for something

00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:28.774
like treating diabetes where you
need to take drugs everyday,

00:22:28.774 --> 00:22:31.669
multiple times a day.
It might be for treating

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:35.016
something like cancer where a
course of chemotherapy could

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:37.599
last for several weeks or
several months.

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:42.129
It might be for treating long
term disorders like hemophilia

00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:44.970
where you're deficient in factor
8,

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.786
a protein in the blood and you
need to have injections of

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:54.015
factor 8 continuously.
So, it's only for certain kinds

00:22:54.015 --> 00:22:58.206
of things but you could imagine
that there are those kinds of

00:22:58.206 --> 00:23:01.069
medical problems that you could
treat.

00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:04.578
Well, here's one way to
achieve long release of drug

00:23:04.578 --> 00:23:08.115
into the body from an implant.
To make implants out of

00:23:08.115 --> 00:23:10.650
biocompatible materials like
polymers.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.782
What's shown on the bottom of
this slide here is an implant

00:23:13.782 --> 00:23:16.537
that's made of a gray substance,
which is a polymer,

00:23:16.537 --> 00:23:20.427
a biocompatible polymer.
Imagine it's something like the

00:23:20.427 --> 00:23:25.029
contact lenses that you would
put in contact with your eye.

00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:28.520
These are materials that are
synthetic materials but

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.080
they're--your body doesn't
respond to them as foreign

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.533
objects very strongly.
You can put some polymers in

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:39.059
contact with one of the most
sensitive areas of your body,

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:42.400
your eye, and it can remain
there for a long period of time

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.740
without very much response of
your body to the material.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.461
Well, what if you took that
material embedded within it drug

00:23:48.461 --> 00:23:50.390
molecules?
That's what's shown here.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.611
In fact, it's not just
molecules of drug,

00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:55.722
its solid particles of drug
which are shown as the orange

00:23:55.722 --> 00:23:58.646
dots here,
so that this whole thing is

00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:02.779
maybe the size of a coin,
maybe the size of a dime.

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:06.048
What I'm showing you here is a
cross-section of that dime,

00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:08.113
dime laying flat,
I cut it like this,

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:10.349
you're looking at it from the
side.

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:13.110
It's a millimeter or so in
depth;

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:18.492
several millimeters in diameter.
It's a solid polymer,

00:24:18.492 --> 00:24:22.836
but inside of it are particles
of the drug that you want to

00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:25.495
deliver.
What these graphs show are

00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:29.660
experiments that we did - this
was back in the late 1980s,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.512
where we put drug molecules
into these polymers and then

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:35.519
just dropped them into a test
tube and ask the question,

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:39.924
'Could we release drugs slowly
from these implants so we could

00:24:39.924 --> 00:24:42.740
make a long lasting pill
essentially,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.240
make a long lasting implant
that slowly released drugs?'

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.550
This shows for a drug that
is used to treat Parkinson's

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.970
disease, another sort of chronic
indication,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.235
where patients have to take
drugs everyday for the rest of

00:24:57.235 --> 00:25:00.261
their life.
This shows that when you drop

00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:03.960
these implants into a test tube
full of water,

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.793
the Dopamine is released and
it's released for a fairly long

00:25:06.793 --> 00:25:08.706
period of time.
This is days here,

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:11.509
so this point here is 30 days,
about a month.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:18.150
One of these systems released a
drug for a period of a month.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.786
One released for almost three
months here, a sort of

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:24.710
continuous and reliable source
of drug,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.682
so you can make implants that
release drug molecules over long

00:25:27.682 --> 00:25:30.156
periods of time.
The rest of these curves

00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:33.577
just show you that you could do
this with drugs like Dopamine

00:25:33.577 --> 00:25:36.769
that are small in molecular
weight and water soluble.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:40.816
You could do it with proteins,
which are higher in molecular

00:25:40.816 --> 00:25:44.567
weight, and also water soluble.
You could even do it with gene

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:46.798
therapy vectors,
with plasmids we talked about

00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:48.498
several weeks ago.
Plasmid DNA,

00:25:48.498 --> 00:25:52.720
these are big molecules;
very difficult to administer.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.696
We talked about how hard it is
to get plasmid DNA inside of

00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:58.672
cells, but you can put them into
these polymers and they'll

00:25:58.672 --> 00:26:01.545
slowly be released from the
polymer over a long period of

00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:04.538
time.
So, one could potentially make

00:26:04.538 --> 00:26:08.099
a long lasting gene therapy
deliver system.

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:11.960
One of the advantages of
making these materials out of

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.091
polymers is that we now know how
to--you can make all kinds of

00:26:16.091 --> 00:26:19.661
things out of polymers.
That's one of the nice features

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:22.637
of plastics or polymers,
is that you can mold them and

00:26:22.637 --> 00:26:25.390
shape them into all sorts of
kinds of devices.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:30.507
Here, this is that same kind of
material, but instead of making

00:26:30.507 --> 00:26:34.304
a coin out of it,
we coated it onto the surface

00:26:34.304 --> 00:26:36.920
of a wire.
This is a bare wire,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.300
and it's the kind of wire that
you can put into the brain and

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.534
you can measure recordings of
what's happening in the brain

00:26:45.534 --> 00:26:48.608
extracellular space.
You can measure action

00:26:48.608 --> 00:26:51.844
potentials and electrical
activity in the brain by putting

00:26:51.844 --> 00:26:54.940
electrodes in.
Physicians do this all the time

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.269
to measure activity in the brain
in patients that have epilepsy,

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:01.804
for example.
One of the problems with

00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:05.190
these materials is that when you
put them into the brain they're

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.569
not completely biocompatible.
The brain does respond to them.

00:27:08.569 --> 00:27:11.003
It will form a scar around them
and eventually the electrode

00:27:11.003 --> 00:27:14.460
won't work anymore.
We coated these electrodes with

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.637
a polymer that contained drug.
In this case it's a drug,

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:21.124
dexamethasone.
It's a steroid that prevents

00:27:21.124 --> 00:27:24.548
scar formation locally.
So, you make a wire that's able

00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:27.880
to record, but it's also able to
deliver a drug.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.733
Now, when this is placed in the
brain you not only can make the

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:35.152
recordings, but the drug is
slowly being released and it

00:27:35.152 --> 00:27:39.130
prevents scar formation around
the outside of the electrode,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:44.100
and the electrode will function
for a longer period of time

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.116
inside the patient.
This is an example of

00:27:47.116 --> 00:27:49.743
taking a medical device,
the kind of devices we've been

00:27:49.743 --> 00:27:52.402
talking about,
and will continue to talk

00:27:52.402 --> 00:27:57.019
about, and making it safer and
better by adding drug delivery.

00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:00.310
The other advantage to this is
that I didn't have to deliver

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:03.880
steroids all over the body in
order to accomplish this effect.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.470
We put the steroids right on
the device and they act locally

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.337
when they're needed.
You don't have steroids

00:28:10.337 --> 00:28:14.323
delivered all over the body but
only at the site where you're

00:28:14.323 --> 00:28:17.965
doing the intervention.
Well, this has become a very

00:28:17.965 --> 00:28:21.523
big business in--around the
world, and that's because

00:28:21.523 --> 00:28:25.560
several companies took this kind
of technology that had been

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.049
developed and used it in a very
clinically important

00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:32.644
application.
What this shows you here is

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:35.831
a stent, it's made of a metal.
This is one kind of it,

00:28:35.831 --> 00:28:37.420
there are many sort of versions
of this.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:43.159
Imagine this is a stent that's
expanded over this tube that's

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:45.869
inside.
You can imagine this design

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:49.911
here which looks like a--kind of
chicken wire fence could be

00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:53.748
collapsed because the wires
are--would bend and you could

00:28:53.748 --> 00:28:56.420
collapse this into a smaller
form.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.753
What they do is they collapse
this into a form around the end

00:29:00.753 --> 00:29:05.343
of a tube called a catheter.
A shrunken version of this

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:10.003
stent, shrunken only in its
diameter being reduced,

00:29:10.003 --> 00:29:15.072
is then put into your body.
The catheter is a long narrow

00:29:15.072 --> 00:29:19.225
plastic tube that can be
inserted into a distal artery

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:22.359
like your femoral artery in your
leg.

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:26.198
Physicians know how to move
this catheter up into your body

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:29.640
and actually into the blood
vessels of your heart.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.839
They put this tube up into your
coronary artery.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:38.144
One of the manifestations
of heart disease is that

00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:41.150
coronary arteries become
sclerotic,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:45.597
they become narrowed because
you get atherosclerotic plaques

00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:47.891
there.
If the vessel becomes narrow

00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:50.490
then blood can't flow through
very easily.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.247
That can lead to pain in your
chest because your heart is not

00:29:54.247 --> 00:29:57.630
getting enough blood and can
lead to a heart attack,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:02.369
or loss of blood flow to the
heart and death of that tissue.

00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:05.585
When that process starts to
happen, what if you put one of

00:30:05.585 --> 00:30:08.490
these catheters in?
I didn't tell you that the

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:12.195
catheter also has a balloon on
the tip and the balloon is

00:30:12.195 --> 00:30:15.566
underneath this stent.
So, once you've got it in

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:19.410
place, you blow up the balloon,
the stent becomes larger,

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.500
it forces the blood vessel to
become open.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.741
Then you deflate the balloon,
and because this is made of

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:28.809
metal it doesn't deflate when
the balloon deflates.

00:30:28.809 --> 00:30:31.134
It stays there inside your
blood vessel,

00:30:31.134 --> 00:30:34.890
holding the blood vessel open
so now blood flow can continue.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:38.664
This is a very common
medical therapy that's done as

00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:42.633
an alternative to heart bypass.
We'll talk about heart bypass

00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:45.642
operations in a few weeks.
Instead of having a new blood

00:30:45.642 --> 00:30:48.390
vessel put into your heart,
which is a major operation,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.730
you can put this stent in,
blow up the balloon,

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.361
inflate the vessel,
and the stent is left behind in

00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:59.458
order to keep the vessel open.
Well you could imagine that

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:01.569
this is not a normal
circumstance.

00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:04.704
Your blood vessels were not
designed to have a piece of

00:31:04.704 --> 00:31:07.200
metal inserted in them to hold
them open.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.258
In fact, they respond to this.
They respond in the way that

00:31:12.258 --> 00:31:15.974
your body responds to having
foreign objects put into it,

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:18.430
it tries to form a scar around
it.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.192
Often that scar formation will
occur so aggressively that scar

00:31:23.192 --> 00:31:27.331
tissue starts to fill in the
vessel where--that you've

00:31:27.331 --> 00:31:29.818
opened,
and this process is called

00:31:29.818 --> 00:31:32.041
restenosis.
What these companies did

00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:34.616
was took these stents,
which were known to be very

00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:37.378
effective,
and physicians are very capable

00:31:37.378 --> 00:31:41.535
and able to put these into the
body, into the coronary vascular

00:31:41.535 --> 00:31:45.041
system now readily.
They coated the wires with a

00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:48.960
polymer and that's what's shown
in this cartoon here.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.056
The yellow is a wire and this
gray is a polymer like the

00:31:52.056 --> 00:31:55.660
polymers I've been describing,
and why coat it with a polymer?

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.217
Because now you can put drugs
inside the polymer and the drugs

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:02.250
will be slowly released from
this polymer coating.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.960
This becomes not just a stent,
but what they call in the

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.769
industry a drug-eluting stent.
It releases drugs that prevent

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:14.481
scar formation locally.
A patient that has heart

00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:18.660
disease gets one of these stents
put in their vascular system,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.901
they open up the artery,
and now that stent not only

00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:27.725
holds the artery open but it
contains enough drug molecules

00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:32.050
that are released slowly over
time that prevents this

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.960
restenosis and the vessel stays
open for,

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.180
hopefully, the rest of their
life.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.723
We're going to talk more
about stents and mechanical

00:32:42.723 --> 00:32:47.680
objects like this that are used
for medical therapy later.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.660
The important part here is the
coating on the stent which

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.389
releases drugs very slowly.
It's really just an extension

00:32:57.389 --> 00:33:01.170
of what I showed you in the last
couple of slides.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:06.129
These were released into
the--approved by the FDA in 2002

00:33:06.129 --> 00:33:10.734
or so, a few years ago,
and became one of the biggest

00:33:10.734 --> 00:33:14.099
selling drug products ever in
U.S.

00:33:14.099 --> 00:33:16.736
history, which tells you
something about sort of the

00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:18.650
clinical need for things like
this.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.044
Again, like that other system,
one of the advantages is you're

00:33:22.044 --> 00:33:25.105
not delivering drugs over the
whole body but only in the

00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:28.389
vessel where you need it,
only in the vessel where the

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:32.338
scar is going to form.
You can deliver drugs locally,

00:33:32.338 --> 00:33:36.980
you can prevent side effects
that would happen in other

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.370
places.
One more example,

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.233
and in that example I just
showed you, that you have a

00:33:43.233 --> 00:33:47.752
stent which is going to remain
in the patient for a long period

00:33:47.752 --> 00:33:49.937
of time.
There's a good reason to put

00:33:49.937 --> 00:33:51.838
the stent there,
to hold this vessel open so

00:33:51.838 --> 00:33:53.430
that you can get good blood
flow.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.838
In other situations you might
want to introduce an implant but

00:33:57.838 --> 00:34:01.089
you don't want the implant to
last forever.

00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:04.697
Because it's not a natural
material, you might like the

00:34:04.697 --> 00:34:08.409
implant to go away.
There are some polymers like

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:13.112
this that can be made into
devices like this implant here,

00:34:13.112 --> 00:34:16.659
which is again about the size
of a coin.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.711
It's made of a very special
polymer that's different than

00:34:19.711 --> 00:34:21.946
the kinds that are used in
contact lenses,

00:34:21.946 --> 00:34:26.330
in that it slowly dissolves.
If I implant this coin made of

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:31.699
this kind of material into the
body it will slowly dissolve.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.722
If I implant it into the skin
and then I go back and I look

00:34:35.722 --> 00:34:39.190
several months later,
the implant itself is totally

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.555
disappeared.
Of course you can't do this

00:34:42.555 --> 00:34:45.829
without any--with just any kind
of material.

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:47.858
It has to be a very special
material that's both

00:34:47.858 --> 00:34:49.757
biocompatible,
that your body doesn't respond

00:34:49.757 --> 00:34:52.492
to,
and that dissolves down to

00:34:52.492 --> 00:34:56.683
molecules that are not toxic.
It's not so easy to design

00:34:56.683 --> 00:34:58.866
these things,
but there are some materials

00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:02.305
that are available now.
What we did in this experiment

00:35:02.305 --> 00:35:06.553
was showed that you could load
these polymers with chemotherapy

00:35:06.553 --> 00:35:09.347
drugs.
These are just three different

00:35:09.347 --> 00:35:12.930
chemotherapy drugs.
You could load them in such a

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.457
way that if you put this
material into water that

00:35:16.457 --> 00:35:19.910
chemotherapy drugs would be
slowly released.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.934
That's what's shown here.
This is with the drug BCNU,

00:35:23.934 --> 00:35:27.738
it's a drug that's commonly
used to treat--or at least it

00:35:27.738 --> 00:35:30.794
was in the 1990s,
commonly used to treat brain

00:35:30.794 --> 00:35:35.124
cancer.
It's released over a period of

00:35:35.124 --> 00:35:38.642
seven days;
90% of the drug is released and

00:35:38.642 --> 00:35:42.800
then the last 10% comes out over
a period of several months.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.132
If we look longer than that,
all the drug is gone now and

00:35:46.132 --> 00:35:48.809
then the polymer itself starts
to dissolve.

00:35:48.809 --> 00:35:51.511
By three months later,
or four months later,

00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:53.710
the whole device has
disappeared.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.809
It disappears in an orderly
fashion.

00:35:56.809 --> 00:35:59.667
In fact, we engineered it to
work just this way,

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:03.193
such that most of the drug
would be released rapidly over a

00:36:03.193 --> 00:36:05.823
period of a week,
10% of the drug would be

00:36:05.823 --> 00:36:08.869
released more slowly over a
period of several months,

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:13.322
and then the device itself
would be completely gone in a

00:36:13.322 --> 00:36:17.130
period of six months or so.
What would you use this for?

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:22.848
Well, this was designed as a
device that you would give to

00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:29.570
neurosurgeons so that they could
improve therapy of brain tumors.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:36.281
You probably know that tumors
of the brain are among the most

00:36:36.281 --> 00:36:40.499
difficult to treat.
If you get a tumor in the

00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:44.912
central nervous system they have
very poor prognosis or life

00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:47.364
expectancy.
People that get aggressive

00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:50.711
brain tumors die within a very
short time after it's diagnosed,

00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:53.733
unfortunately.
That situation hasn't changed

00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:58.529
much over the last 100 years.
One of the reasons is what we

00:36:58.529 --> 00:37:02.593
mentioned earlier,
that the brain is protected

00:37:02.593 --> 00:37:07.110
from chemical entry by the blood
brain barrier.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.958
Capillaries in your brain don't
allow molecules to move across

00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:13.042
them.
There's good reasons for that,

00:37:13.042 --> 00:37:16.217
so that your brain chemistry
can remain constant throughout

00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:18.310
the day.
Because of that blood brain

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:21.567
barrier, if you give drugs the
normal way by taking pills or

00:37:21.567 --> 00:37:23.817
injections,
you get high doses everywhere

00:37:23.817 --> 00:37:26.059
else but not very much gets into
the brain.

00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:30.937
We thought that when they
do neurosurgery to remove a

00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:35.639
tumor, which is commonly done,
the brain is exposed.

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:39.708
The surgeon has an opportunity,
then, to do something

00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:43.513
extraordinary.
That is to, after the surgery,

00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:48.791
they remove the tumor then they
could place these wafers inside

00:37:48.791 --> 00:37:53.416
the surgical resection cavity.
Where the tumor used to be,

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:57.521
you place these coins that are
made of this degradable polymer

00:37:57.521 --> 00:38:00.280
that released these drugs very
slowly.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:05.641
The patient leaves the
operating room with most of

00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:09.579
their tumor gone,
and in addition,

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:14.661
these drug delivery systems
which are releasing drugs slowly

00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:19.569
to kill any tumor cells that
remain in the vicinity of the

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:24.217
surgical site.
This is a different strategy

00:38:24.217 --> 00:38:27.389
for drug delivery.
It's a very specialized

00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:30.289
strategy for delivering drugs.
It's one that takes advantage

00:38:30.289 --> 00:38:33.309
of the fact that you're having a
medical procedure already.

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:36.543
Can we design something that's
going to make that procedure

00:38:36.543 --> 00:38:39.699
even more effective?
This was approved by the FDA;

00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:45.639
it's now the standard of care
for treating brain tumors

00:38:45.639 --> 00:38:51.079
at--most countries in the world.
How could you make this

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:54.099
more--how could you make this
kind of technology,

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:57.119
or this kind of engineering,
more accessible?

00:38:57.119 --> 00:39:01.305
Like here was an example,
actually several examples,

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:05.326
of very specialized
applications of this different

00:39:05.326 --> 00:39:09.291
form of drug delivery.
Well, one way you could do it

00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:13.017
is by shrinking these devices
down, so that they're so small

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.860
they could be introduced through
a needle.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.814
Those wafers I showed you
before could be used by surgeons

00:39:20.814 --> 00:39:25.682
because they--the tissue is
exposed and you could implant

00:39:25.682 --> 00:39:28.913
things in.
That's not the case for many

00:39:28.913 --> 00:39:32.275
other indications;
surgery isn't done in every

00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:35.802
medical situation.
If you could put a needle into

00:39:35.802 --> 00:39:39.481
the body and introduce these
delivery systems through

00:39:39.481 --> 00:39:42.602
needles,
then maybe that would make it

00:39:42.602 --> 00:39:45.429
better for other forms of
disease.

00:39:45.429 --> 00:39:49.218
These are micro-particles,
they're made of the same kinds

00:39:49.218 --> 00:39:53.070
of degradable polymers but
they're very tiny particles now.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.313
In section this afternoon we'll
talk about how you make these

00:39:57.313 --> 00:40:00.779
kinds of particles,
and you'll actually be able to

00:40:00.779 --> 00:40:03.679
make some.
These particular ones are made

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:06.734
of the same kind of polymer that
slowly degrades,

00:40:06.734 --> 00:40:09.789
but they're very small,
they're a micron or so in

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:11.896
diameter.
They're much,

00:40:11.896 --> 00:40:17.513
much smaller than a needle and
they can be injected through a

00:40:17.513 --> 00:40:20.004
needle.
You just imagine suspending

00:40:20.004 --> 00:40:22.596
these particles which look like
dust in water,

00:40:22.596 --> 00:40:25.130
and then injecting them through
a needle.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.923
They also have the property
that you can put drugs in them

00:40:27.923 --> 00:40:30.913
at fairly high concentration and
the drugs are released slowly

00:40:30.913 --> 00:40:33.593
over time.
If I put a needle into a tissue

00:40:33.593 --> 00:40:37.517
and introduce these particles,
the particles will sit there at

00:40:37.517 --> 00:40:41.312
the tissue site and they'll
release the drug molecules for a

00:40:41.312 --> 00:40:44.400
long period time just like the
implants do.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.811
Just to show that this
works and how tiny you might be

00:40:47.811 --> 00:40:51.522
able to make the particles and
how locally you might be able to

00:40:51.522 --> 00:40:54.519
deliver them,
we made some particles like

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:58.846
this and we injected them into
the eye of an animal that had

00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:02.239
retinal disease.
The animal had a disease of the

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:04.820
retina such that would cause
blindness.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.834
Ordinarily there are many drugs
that are known to prevent this

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:14.110
kind of blindness,
but they have short half-lives.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.117
If I inject the drug directly
into the eye it disappears

00:41:18.117 --> 00:41:22.013
within a day.
So, here's a drug that works,

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:25.590
here's a condition that it
works in.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.181
It's a condition that causes a
very serious medical problem,

00:41:29.181 --> 00:41:32.590
blindness but in order to use
the drug you have to get an

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:36.260
injection in the eye everyday.
That's the only way to get

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.400
concentrations high enough for
it to be effective.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.546
If you put it into the
particles that I showed you

00:41:41.546 --> 00:41:43.780
before, you put the same drug
into the particles,

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.303
you inject the particles into
the eye, the particles stay

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:48.813
there in the eye.
They stay there for a long

00:41:48.813 --> 00:41:52.884
time, and drug concentration now
lasts for 30 days instead of one

00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:53.330
day.

00:41:57.329 --> 00:42:00.441
This takes what would be an
unthinkable therapy,

00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.675
difficult to think even if
blind--if you want to avoid

00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:05.918
blindness,
difficult to think about

00:42:05.918 --> 00:42:09.506
getting an injection in your eye
once a day for the rest of the

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:11.590
time you want to remain
eyesight,

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:15.024
but you might think about it
once a month if it meant the

00:42:15.024 --> 00:42:19.010
difference between being able to
see and not being able to see.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.154
If we could make the particles
better, such that they worked

00:42:22.154 --> 00:42:24.287
for three months,
that makes it even more

00:42:24.287 --> 00:42:26.937
possible.
If they work for a year--then

00:42:26.937 --> 00:42:30.852
once a year, and you can see
that's a therapy that would be

00:42:30.852 --> 00:42:35.187
acceptable to most people.
It's an example of an approach

00:42:35.187 --> 00:42:39.230
but it also shows the
constraints of the approach.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:43.737
So far we can do a month;
we'd like to be able to do

00:42:43.737 --> 00:42:46.229
longer.
As we do longer this will

00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:51.132
become a more--a therapy that's
more likely to be adopted into

00:42:51.132 --> 00:42:54.289
clinical practice.
You can imagine that making

00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:57.039
it longer requires better
engineering of these particles.

00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:01.381
It's hard to make particles
that are really small but hold

00:43:01.381 --> 00:43:05.193
onto drugs for a long time.
That's a hard thing to make

00:43:05.193 --> 00:43:08.815
particles that are really small
but hold onto drugs for a long

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:10.706
time.
What we've gotten good at so

00:43:10.706 --> 00:43:13.489
far is making particles that are
really, really small.

00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:16.650
These are the--these are sort
of the state-of-the-art.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.309
These are particles that are
made of a degradable polymer.

00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:24.221
They're only 150 nanometers in
size, so now much smaller than a

00:43:24.221 --> 00:43:27.230
micron even;
these are the size of a virus.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.726
We were talking about
smallpox virus before,

00:43:29.726 --> 00:43:33.296
a naturally occurring pathogen.
These are synthetic polymers

00:43:33.296 --> 00:43:36.995
made totally in the laboratory
that are the same size as a

00:43:36.995 --> 00:43:40.759
virus and they're made of a
polymer that's well known to be

00:43:40.759 --> 00:43:45.019
safe and they also contain drug.
These particular particles were

00:43:45.019 --> 00:43:48.380
made by a graduate student who
worked with named Amarilys

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.903
Sanchez,
and Amarilys was able to put

00:43:50.903 --> 00:43:54.764
20% by weight of a chemotherapy
drug inside these very tiny

00:43:54.764 --> 00:43:58.340
particles,
particles the size of a virus.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.467
Even though the particles are
very tiny the drug comes out

00:44:01.467 --> 00:44:04.210
relatively slowly over a period
of about a week.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.230
Now, why make particles so
small?

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.070
Well, it turns out that these
particles are so small that they

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.699
can actually enter cells.
Like viruses they can infect

00:44:15.699 --> 00:44:19.970
cells, only they don't infect in
the same way that a virus does

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.519
because they're totally
synthetic.

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:25.872
They don't reproduce,
they just sit inside the cells

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:29.289
and they release chemotherapy
drugs, in this case.

00:44:29.289 --> 00:44:33.077
Well, that's--makes
possible a totally different

00:44:33.077 --> 00:44:37.278
strategy for treating cancer.
One of the problems with

00:44:37.278 --> 00:44:41.945
treating cancer is that cancer
drugs have to get deep inside

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:46.023
the cell in order to work.
Most of them work by inhibiting

00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:49.244
cell division and most of the
targets for inhibiting cell

00:44:49.244 --> 00:44:51.429
division are not just within
cells,

00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:55.420
they're within the nucleus
inside the cell.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.114
The approach for chemotherapy
is to deliver these toxic drugs

00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:04.809
all over the body and hope that
they get into tumor cells.

00:45:04.809 --> 00:45:08.244
Hope that they get into tumor
cells at high enough

00:45:08.244 --> 00:45:12.378
concentrations that they can
reach these targets deep in the

00:45:12.378 --> 00:45:15.042
nucleus.
What is possible,

00:45:15.042 --> 00:45:21.369
we think, with this approach is
that you can design not just

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:24.050
long release of drugs,

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.477
but you can design particles
that will specifically recognize

00:45:32.477 --> 00:45:37.669
tumor cells in the same way that
viruses recognize tumor cells or

00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:42.050
specific cells that will enter
only certain cells,

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.405
and that they'll release their
drugs only when they've entered

00:45:45.405 --> 00:45:49.761
the correct cell.
That would be potentially a

00:45:49.761 --> 00:45:55.769
much safer, more effective form
of chemotherapy.

00:45:55.769 --> 00:45:58.985
I've taken,
in this lecture,

00:45:58.985 --> 00:46:05.313
and covered a lot of material,
but the important things I hope

00:46:05.313 --> 00:46:11.005
are to--which I've emphasized,
I hoped, are to think about

00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:15.575
ordinary forms or common forms
of drug administration like

00:46:15.575 --> 00:46:19.475
pills and injections,
and understand a little bit

00:46:19.475 --> 00:46:22.840
about how those forms of
administration lead to

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.449
concentration changes within the
body as a function of time,

00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:31.980
and how those forms are limited
in some ways.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.199
Now, even with those
limitations, obviously medical

00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:40.165
therapy has advanced
tremendously because of the

00:46:40.165 --> 00:46:46.714
availability of drugs.
Antibiotics have changed our

00:46:46.714 --> 00:46:49.926
lifespan.
People don't die of infectious

00:46:49.926 --> 00:46:53.295
diseases because of vaccines and
because there are antibiotics

00:46:53.295 --> 00:46:55.450
that you can take,
sometimes orally.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:59.316
We all have taken them.
You've taken antibiotics and

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:02.357
you got better,
so drug therapy has been an

00:47:02.357 --> 00:47:06.172
incredible advance.
The second part I want you

00:47:06.172 --> 00:47:10.320
to think about is how sort of
engineering of materials,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.950
in the case I've described
here, could allow you to think

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.969
about making systems for drug
delivery that are even better.

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:22.206
That can take existing drugs
and expose them to the body in

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:26.151
different ways such they're
safer and more effective at

00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:29.000
treating certain kinds of
diseases.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.060
We'll meet at section this
afternoon;

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:38.355
any questions?
Great, see you this

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.355
afternoon.

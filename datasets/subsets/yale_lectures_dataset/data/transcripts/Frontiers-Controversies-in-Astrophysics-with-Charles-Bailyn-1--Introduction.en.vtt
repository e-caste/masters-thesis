00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.018
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Some things about

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:04.000
this course.
This is a course for

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.355
non-scientists.
That portion of the enrollment

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.629
policies is not a suggestion.
I really don't want science

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.893
majors in this class.
If you are a science major,

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:17.493
I'm going to notice because
that's one of the things that

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:20.320
appears on the class list;
what your major is.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.750
So, don't take the course if
you're a science major.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.495
Let me point out that freshmen
don't have major,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:32.116
so it doesn't matter if you
intend to be a science major if

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:35.567
you're a freshman.
If you are a science major I

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.780
recommend Astro 210,
which is being given this term.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.470
I have a little handout on all
the different introductory

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.831
astronomy courses at the front
of the room if you're

00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.829
interested.
Let's see, it is also true that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.849
this course is kind of intended
for non-science majors who have

00:00:55.849 --> 00:01:01.383
a certain basic high school
level comfort with tenth-grade

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:05.340
science and math.
If you're extremely phobic

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.610
about these kinds of things,
I would say that Astronomy 120,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.638
while it has a similar level of
math, has a somewhat shallower

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:16.939
learning curve and a somewhat
deeper safety net.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.790
So, if you're the kind of
person who breaks into a sweat

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.780
when somebody writes down an
equal sign, check out 120.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.114
Let's see, but that's not the
biggest difference between this

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.333
class and 120.
I think the biggest difference

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.739
is what the class is trying to
do.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.548
Astronomy 120 and also 110 and
other courses in our department,

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.742
and elsewhere in the
university, are basically survey

00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:43.824
courses.
Most introductory science

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:47.034
courses are survey courses.
They cover a fairly wide

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.686
subject matter.
This is--isn't that,

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:54.388
what this course is supposed to
do is we're going to talk about

00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:58.560
three particular topics in very
considerable detail.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.988
Enough detail so that by the
end of our discussion you'll

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:07.969
understand what's going on in
current research in this topic.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.034
And by current,
I don't mean this decade,

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:14.080
I mean this week.
Astronomy is currently in a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.614
stage of very rapid advancement,
and one of the things that's

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:21.090
happened every time I've taught
this course in the past,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.021
is that at some point during
the semester someone will

00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:27.450
publish some piece of research
which changes some aspect of the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.960
curriculum.
I'll come in waving some paper

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.319
and everything will be changed,
and I can't guarantee that of

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.853
course,
because I can't predict the

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.620
future but it's happened every
time in the past.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.657
So, we really are trying to get
you all the way out to the

00:02:40.657 --> 00:02:44.116
frontiers of the subject.
I think this is actually a

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:47.506
better approach for non-science
majors, because after all,

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:51.131
we live in the Internet age.
If you want to find out a bunch

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:54.694
of facts about some scientific
topic you could go online and go

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:57.510
to Wikipedia or wherever,
look these facts up.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.587
That's not a big problem.
The problem comes when there

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:05.909
are two sets of facts which
directly contradict each other.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.470
This happens quite frequently
in scientific topics these days,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.180
particularly those with kind of
political or moral overtones,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.860
and you get facts that directly
contradict each other.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.159
What are you supposed to do
about that?

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.675
What I'm hoping is that by
talking about situations in

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:28.389
which the facts at the moment
really aren't known yet,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.882
you can develop some skill in
interpreting these kinds of

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:35.690
contradictory facts for
yourself.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.961
If you don't do that,
then the only alternative is to

00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:42.925
listen to the experts argue with
each other and vote for whoever

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.889
argues the loudest or looks the
best when they're doing it,

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.190
or has a degree from Harvard or
whatever it is.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.250
You guys can do better than
that.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.468
So, the hope is that by
practicing this kind of skill of

00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:02.069
evaluating science when the
answer isn't fully understood,

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.618
that you can develop skills
that will stand you in good

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:09.035
stead when you run into
scientific controversies in a

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:11.729
political context or a legal
context,

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.660
or just as ordinary citizens in
the course of your lives.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.068
It also happens that the three
particular topics I think are of

00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:26.430
some real interest and
importance in themselves.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.758
And I'll get to the three
topics again in just a moment

00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:31.756
here.
Let me point out that this kind

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:34.840
of approach has a downside to it
and this has been pointed out

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.660
repeatedly on course
evaluations.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.646
Because we're dealing with
stuff which ultimately the

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.690
answers are not yet understood
there's no textbook.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.686
There can't be a textbook.
We haven't figured out what to

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.330
put in the textbooks yet.
And the problem with that is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.039
that that makes the lectures
very important because that's

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.129
the only information you're
going to get.

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.557
There's a whole bunch of online
readings and stuff but they tend

00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:58.677
to have a point of view,
and so it's really the lectures

00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:01.000
that are the basis of the
course.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.237
The problem with that is that
I've chosen to give this course

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.990
at the ungodly early hour of
9:30 in the morning,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.737
and you guys are going to have
to show up and so here's the

00:05:10.737 --> 00:05:12.923
deal.
I'll make a deal with you:

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:16.389
Your job is to get to class by
9:30 in the morning.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.261
My job is to keep you awake
once you're here,

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:25.452
and so if we both succeed in
cooperating in this sense we'll

00:05:25.452 --> 00:05:28.224
probably be okay.
But seriously,

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:32.318
if you're anticipating regular
difficulties in getting to class

00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:36.280
this is not actually a great
class to take because there's no

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.790
backup in the form of a
textbook.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.444
All right, the particular
topics that are under

00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:46.019
discussion, I've listed them
here in green.

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:48.459
The first of them are
extra-solar planets,

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.910
by which I mean planets around
stars other than the Sun.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.250
It's well known that there are
many, many of these planets.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.754
All you have to do is watch
Star Trek or something like that

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:02.248
and you'll find many,
many examples and this has been

00:06:02.248 --> 00:06:05.750
a staple of science fiction for
quite a long time.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.884
Oddly enough,
until ten years ago,

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:10.730
there was absolutely no
evidence for this.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.991
We assumed that,
because the stars are normal

00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:16.126
stars and there are many other
stars--the Sun is a normal star

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:19.262
and there are many other stars
like the Sun that there must be

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:22.345
many planets of the same kind as
the planets in our own Solar

00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:25.069
System circling around all these
other stars.

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.353
But until 1995 there was not
one bit of evidence to support

00:06:29.353 --> 00:06:32.211
that idea.
Since 1995, this has become a

00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:35.746
huge growth industry and
research, and we now know of

00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:39.730
literally hundreds of planets,
all of them discovered in the

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.158
last ten years.
So, this is a situation in

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:44.700
which, what ten years ago was
science fiction,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.806
has become science fact and
we're very rapidly trying to

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.970
figure out exactly what kinds of
planets these are,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.869
whether there are Earth-like
planets out there,

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:57.588
and that has some bearing on
what the science fiction people

00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:01.550
refer to when they say as,
"life as we know it."

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.649
And so, that's currently one of
the hottest topics in astronomy.

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:11.507
The next topic is going to be
black holes, and this is a

00:07:11.507 --> 00:07:14.620
similar situation.
Fifteen, twenty years ago black

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.545
holes were sort of poised
precariously on the boundary

00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:20.360
between theoretical physics and
science fiction.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.000
A boundary that is more porous
than you might believe.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.043
But again, in the past fifteen
years or so this has been

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:30.420
converted into a standard topic
in observational astronomy.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.807
There are dozens,
probably hundreds of objects we

00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:35.742
can point to in the sky and say,
"yes those things are black

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:38.358
holes."
And so now, the current topic

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:42.424
of research is do these things
that we are pretty sure are

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:46.490
black holes actually behave in
the incredibly bizarre,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.537
science-fictiony manner that
the theoretical physicists have

00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:52.430
been talking about for the past
thirty or forty years.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.697
So, to what extent are these
very exotic behaviors actually

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:59.770
manifested in real life?
Finally, I want to talk a

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.548
little bit about cosmology.
Cosmology is the study of the

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:05.382
Universe as a whole.
That's too big a topic to go

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:08.339
into in depth,
so I've picked one piece of it.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:12.640
The piece I've picked is the
existence, which was discovered

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.775
in the late 1990s,
of something called "dark

00:08:15.775 --> 00:08:19.701
energy."
Dark energy is an all-pervading

00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:22.804
anti-gravity;
it's a repulsive force that

00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:26.189
turns out to occupy essentially
all of the Universe,

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:30.181
and 75% or more of the entire
mass energy of the Universe

00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:34.529
turns out to be in the form of
this mysterious dark energy.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.954
The evidence for this comes
largely, but not entirely,

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:41.250
from observations of a certain
kind of supernova.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.807
And so what I'm going to focus
on is the observations of the

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:47.460
supernovae and how they
demonstrated that,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.477
in fact, all ordinary matter
and energy and so forth is a

00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:53.710
tiny fraction of what's actually
going on in the Universe,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.934
and what's really happening out
there is something we totally

00:08:56.934 --> 00:09:00.453
don't begin to understand.
So, that will be the third

00:09:00.453 --> 00:09:04.022
topic of the course.
These topics have something in

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:06.577
common.
All of them involve observing

00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:09.950
something that you can't
actually see directly.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.841
We don't see these planets
directly because they're too

00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:15.782
faint and too far away.
We don't see black holes

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:18.309
directly.
By the definition of black hole

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:20.529
you can't see these things
directly.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:22.218
And of course,
dark energy,

00:09:22.218 --> 00:09:24.879
by its very name,
is also undetectable.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.470
So, how do we know that these
things are there?

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.890
The answer is we know that
they're there because of their

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.639
influence on other objects that
we can see,

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.374
and in particular,
their gravitational influence

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:38.409
on other objects that we can
see.

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:41.084
And so, what binds these three
topics together,

00:09:41.084 --> 00:09:43.875
are first of all,
the fact that the observational

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.422
techniques to discover them are
actually quite similar to each

00:09:47.422 --> 00:09:50.559
other.
And second, that they all

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:54.950
involve different manifestations
of gravity.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.594
And so, we'll be talking in the
first part of the course about

00:09:58.594 --> 00:10:01.090
Newtonian gravity.
In the second part of the

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.847
course when we get to black
holes, that's relativistic

00:10:03.847 --> 00:10:05.557
gravity,
general relativity,

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:08.671
Newton's--Einstein's theory
which supplanted Newton's

00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:11.055
theory.
And then by the time we get to

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:14.209
dark energy, it may not even be
correctly described by

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:17.307
Einstein's work,
and we may be in the area of

00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:21.314
whole new kinds of physics that
the theorists haven't even

00:10:21.314 --> 00:10:24.732
thought about yet.
So, there will be a progression

00:10:24.732 --> 00:10:28.491
to more and more sophisticated
theories of gravity underlying

00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:29.870
these observations.

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:38.208
There's another feature that
these topics have in common,

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:43.014
and that is that they can be
understood in some detail

00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:47.639
without particularly
sophisticated mathematics.

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:51.179
Now, let me pause here and say
some things about math.

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.200
Astronomy is a mathematical
topic.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.702
There will be math in this
course, there ought to be math

00:10:57.702 --> 00:11:01.080
in any astronomy course or it
isn't really an astronomy

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.091
course, it's just a slide show.
Now, the math in this course

00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:07.889
has been kept at a deliberately
low level.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.133
That is to say,
the kind of math we'll be doing

00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:12.279
is stuff you did in ninth and
tenth grade.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:15.242
Introductory high school
algebra, high school geometry,

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:18.370
I think we take the sine of an
angle a couple of times,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.931
but it's the one case it
cancels out almost immediately,

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:27.393
so don't let that scare you.
It's the kind of thing that you

00:11:27.393 --> 00:11:31.212
all did on the math SATs and
since you're all sitting in this

00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:34.564
room you must have done okay.
Having said that,

00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:38.429
I have discovered that saying
that is misleading.

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.745
And the reason it's misleading
is cast your mind back to ninth

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:44.500
grade;
ninth grade math is hard.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.356
Remember?
In particular,

00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:51.289
word problems are hard.
You remember word problems.

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:53.610
This is where you drive from
here to Cleveland and you fill

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.303
your tank up with gas,
and the gas costs so much per

00:11:56.303 --> 00:12:00.190
gallon, and the question is what
is your shoe size or something.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.280
[laughter]
The way one approaches that is

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.521
through a kind of common sense
approach which involves the fact

00:12:05.521 --> 00:12:07.559
that many of us have been in a
car,

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.337
driving from City A to City B,
perhaps not Cleveland,

00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:12.687
but somewhere else,
and so you have a kind of

00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:16.110
intuition to fall back on.
When you do math problems that

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.082
are logically the same,
but apply to astrophysical

00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:21.695
systems,
for which you have absolutely

00:12:21.695 --> 00:12:25.787
no common sense to back you up,
then you have to reason purely

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:30.080
from the internal logic of the
problem and that's hard to do.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.070
It's a skill that can be
learned;

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.509
it's a skill that's worth
learning;

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:36.952
it's a skill that I'm sure many
of you already have to a large

00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:39.039
extent, but it isn't an easy
thing.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:44.240
So, the fact that the level of
the math is low doesn't mean

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.677
that the problems are easy.
We do have a lot of help

00:12:48.677 --> 00:12:52.581
mechanisms, which I'll describe
perhaps on Thursday,

00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:57.251
to keep you up to speed if you
start having trouble with these

00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:59.250
things.
So, I should say something

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.629
about course requirements here.
Let's see, we have sections in

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:04.837
this class.
The sections are not just

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:07.889
problem solving sections,
these are actually required.

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:11.028
The fact that we're dealing in
topics for which the answer

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:14.332
isn't fully known means that one
can actually have discussion

00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:16.590
sections unlike many science
courses,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.251
so we're going to do that.
And so, the structure of the

00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:21.891
course is like a history course.
Two lectures a week plus

00:13:21.891 --> 00:13:24.637
required section,
and so 10% of your grade comes

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.424
from sections.
A large fraction of that is

00:13:27.424 --> 00:13:29.949
just showing up,
but there will also be

00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:33.803
something in terms of saying
something intelligent once you

00:13:33.803 --> 00:13:35.929
get there.
That's 10% of the course;

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:37.799
30% of the course is problem
sets.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:39.850
We will hand these things out
once a week.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.423
The first problem set will show
up on Thursday,

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:45.557
and if you have any question
about whether this course is

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:48.344
appropriate for you,
the right thing to do is to

00:13:48.344 --> 00:13:51.659
look at that problem set and ask
yourself is this reasonable.

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:55.107
I will say that students on
their evaluations have pointed

00:13:55.107 --> 00:13:57.950
out that it does--the course
does get harder.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.226
It's not that the math gets
more complicated,

00:14:00.226 --> 00:14:02.399
but the situations get more
complicated.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:05.971
So, if you have serious trouble
with the first problem set

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:09.149
that's probably a warning sign.
As I say, that will be handed

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:11.533
out on Thursday.
These things come about once a

00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:13.440
week;
it's 30% of the grade.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.740
I'll say more about problem
sets later on Thursday.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.889
Thirty percent comes from two
midterm exams.

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:21.987
The way we do this is the one
where you get the better score

00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:24.195
counts 20%.
The one that you get the worst

00:14:24.195 --> 00:14:26.465
score counts 10%.
So, that gives you a little bit

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.416
of a break.
And then there will be the

00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:30.940
Final exam, that's the last 30%
of the class.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.725
There's also an optional paper.
If you choose to do that,

00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:38.586
that will count 15% of your
grade, and what it will do is it

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:42.446
will de-weight whichever the
worst of your 30% parts of your

00:14:42.446 --> 00:14:46.802
grade are back down to 15%.
So, if you're a word person

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:51.411
rather than a number person,
you get this opportunity to

00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:56.691
augment your score and de-weight
some other part of the class in

00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:59.960
which you may have done less
well.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.010
All of this stuff is on the
classes server [Yale's online

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.668
course tool].
I should say that the syllabus

00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:09.167
that I've put out here is just a
direct copy off of what's on the

00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:12.330
classes server,
so feel free to take that.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.592
But all the information,
and actually more information

00:15:18.592 --> 00:15:21.639
is online.
Let me pause now and ask

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:25.579
whether there are questions
about the course and the course

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:28.009
procedures.
Yes?

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:31.138
Student:
This may be a silly question,

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:35.547
but I saw on the web that right
below the times listed for this

00:15:35.547 --> 00:15:39.814
course was a "to be determined"
or some sort of notation that

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:43.654
could indicate that there is
another of this class at a

00:15:43.654 --> 00:15:45.942
different time?
Professor Charles

00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:47.411
Bailyn: No,
no this class is going to meet

00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:48.969
now.
I'll have to check and see what

00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:51.070
you were thinking of,
but it may be that what that

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.700
was referring to was section
times,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.740
and actually this is something
that I haven't mentioned.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.340
Sections are required.
They're all going to be on

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.245
Mondays.
We're going to have a wide

00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:01.645
range of times,
all of them on Mondays from

00:16:01.645 --> 00:16:03.759
12:30 until I think 8:00 at
night.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:06.059
But you do have to sign up for
a section.

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:08.015
Let me also say,
I've mentioned here,

00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:09.753
I don't think this
is--;actually,

00:16:09.753 --> 00:16:11.980
looking at the number of people
here,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.717
I think we're going to be able
to accommodate everyone,

00:16:14.717 --> 00:16:18.116
including juniors and seniors.
But I did set it up in such a

00:16:18.116 --> 00:16:21.179
way that freshmen and sophomores
get first crack.

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:25.660
The way that's going to work is
the online sectioning form opens

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.571
up on Monday and juniors and
seniors won't be allowed to

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:33.269
officially register for the
class until Tuesday.

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:36.416
So, the freshmen and sophomores
get to fill up the sections

00:16:36.416 --> 00:16:37.332
first.
My guess is,

00:16:37.332 --> 00:16:39.825
again, looking at the number of
people here today that we won't

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:43.972
have any problem,
and that if you're a junior or

00:16:43.972 --> 00:16:47.759
a senior you'll get in just
fine.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:50.975
So, we'll be picking sections
through what is now the standard

00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:53.611
online sectioning thing,
which is going to open for

00:16:53.611 --> 00:16:56.753
business next Monday.
I'll check the website and see

00:16:56.753 --> 00:17:00.035
if that's actually what you
meant, but it may have been

00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:01.570
something else.
Other questions?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.240
Let me, in general,
encourage you to ask questions.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.230
I know that that's hard to do
in a big lecture setting,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.612
but we have an advantage over
other courses,

00:17:15.612 --> 00:17:19.604
particularly science courses.
We're not trying to prepare you

00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:23.864
for the astronomy part of the
MCATs, so we don't have to cover

00:17:23.864 --> 00:17:27.834
a specific syllabus.
We're not even trying to follow

00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:30.491
a textbook.
And so we have a little more

00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:34.348
leeway than is ordinarily true
to ask questions and go in weird

00:17:34.348 --> 00:17:37.210
directions, so please feel free
to do that.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.056
I reserve the right to put a
question off into the future or

00:17:41.056 --> 00:17:44.708
into discussion section or
something, but do by all means

00:17:44.708 --> 00:17:46.840
ask.
We have some freedom of action.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.713
Yes?
Student:

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:50.359
Is it possible to take an early
final?

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:52.920
Professor Charles
Bailyn: An early final?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.357
Let me think about that.
I prefer to avoid it because

00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:57.309
then I have to invent another
final.

00:17:57.309 --> 00:18:01.170
The problem with that is trying
to make them come out even.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.654
I will say this,
that if I do an early final,

00:18:03.654 --> 00:18:06.930
I'm probably going to err on
the side of making it hard.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.589
But it's very hard to make them
come out even,

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:16.290
but let me think about that.
Other questions?

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.787
Yes.
Student:

00:18:17.787 --> 00:18:19.547
In discussion sections,
is it just going to be like

00:18:19.547 --> 00:18:21.658
discussing things or is it going
to be working on the problem

00:18:21.658 --> 00:18:22.571
sets?
Professor Charles

00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:24.087
Bailyn: It's going to be
some--So, the question is,

00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:25.660
"What are the discussions
sections going to be like?"

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.235
Are there going to be
discussion of the problem sets

00:18:28.235 --> 00:18:31.113
or is it going to sort of
general discussion of the course

00:18:31.113 --> 00:18:33.750
material?
The answer is both.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.453
I think there will be both,
in any given discussion

00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:39.588
section, there will probably
both be an opportunity to talk

00:18:39.588 --> 00:18:42.886
about the previous problem set
and to clarify things about the

00:18:42.886 --> 00:18:45.987
next problem set,
and also some kind of activity

00:18:45.987 --> 00:18:49.455
that sort of extends and
advances what we've been talking

00:18:49.455 --> 00:18:51.879
about in class.
So, I'm hoping to do some of

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:54.050
both.
If we veer too much in either

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.180
one direction that's probably
not a good thing.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.690
There will be other ways of
getting help as well,

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.671
if you start to have trouble on
the problem sets or in the

00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:04.893
course generally.
I'll talk about those a little

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:06.759
bit on Thursday.
Yes sir?

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.380
Student:
How are problem sets graded?

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.272
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How are problem sets

00:19:10.272 --> 00:19:12.250
graded?
Very carefully.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:17.517
Let's see, I think we'll
probably--it'll probably be on a

00:19:17.517 --> 00:19:21.279
kind of zero to twenty-point
schedule.

00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:23.609
But let me say this about the
problem sets.

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:25.839
There are going to be two kinds
of things on the problem sets.

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:29.217
One are kind of quantitative
problems which have a right

00:19:29.217 --> 00:19:31.372
answer.
Those are relatively easy to

00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:33.490
grade on some kind of a point
scale;

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.750
you give partial credit and so
forth.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.658
But we will also--because this
is a course that's not only

00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:42.567
about the specific of this topic
but also about science in

00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:44.706
general,
we're also going to have things

00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:47.660
that look kind of like essay
questions on the problem sets.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.037
Those are a little harder to
grade in this way,

00:19:50.037 --> 00:19:53.189
but we've got to grade them in
the same way so that we can add

00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:55.727
the points up.
And I'll talk a little bit more

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:58.279
about how those are graded.
I will say one thing;

00:19:58.279 --> 00:20:03.787
one thing that we do is we make
sure that each problem or essay

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.502
is graded by one T.A.
or by myself,

00:20:06.502 --> 00:20:09.658
so that we don't have different
people--so that if you're in a

00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:12.556
section it's not like your--all
the problem sets for that

00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:15.609
section are all graded by your
section leader and some other

00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:18.299
section leader grades all the
other problems,

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:21.339
because that leads to
imbalances of various kinds.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:25.716
So, we assign each problem to a
specific person for the whole

00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:28.130
class.
It's basically a zero through

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.908
twenty scale,
although what that means varies

00:20:30.908 --> 00:20:33.750
depending on what kind of a
problem it is.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.359
I'll say a little bit more
about that.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:38.800
I will also say there is a
rather detailed lateness policy

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.180
that's linked to the classes
server, please read that.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.859
We're going to stick to it.
And one of the features of that

00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:47.710
is that there will be answer
sheets.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.979
Problem sets are typically due
Thursday, there will be an

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:51.599
answer sheet up the following
Tuesday,

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:55.814
so if you don't get it done by
five days after it's due,

00:20:55.814 --> 00:20:59.340
you're toast because the
answers are posted.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.010
Other questions?

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:09.079
Great, let's start.
This is very cool.

00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:15.220
All right, this is going to be
all kinds of fun.

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:22.140
Planets, planets around other
stars, but planets in general.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.318
So, let's start by talking a
little bit about orbits,

00:21:25.318 --> 00:21:26.480
planetary orbits.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.951
You probably know some of this
story, originally in the old

00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:43.025
days, people used to think that
the Earth was the center of the

00:21:43.025 --> 00:21:46.011
Universe.
So, the Earth was at the middle

00:21:46.011 --> 00:21:48.829
and planets went around them in
circles.

00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:50.699
That's not much of a circle
[drawing on overhead],

00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:54.098
but you know what I mean.
And so, everything was circles

00:21:54.098 --> 00:21:57.831
around the Earth.
And that's what planets did,

00:21:57.831 --> 00:22:02.289
where planets also included to
their way of thinking,

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:06.167
the Sun and the Moon as well,
and so you had these circles

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:09.355
around the Earth.
This is what's called the

00:22:09.355 --> 00:22:12.170
geocentric model;
Earth at the middle.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.946
It's associated with the name
of a Greek astronomer named

00:22:16.946 --> 00:22:19.948
Ptolemy.
The problem with this model is

00:22:19.948 --> 00:22:22.441
very simple.
Namely, that if you actually go

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.859
out and observe where the
planets, and the Sun,

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:28.542
and the Moon are night after
night after night it doesn't

00:22:28.542 --> 00:22:31.864
work very well.
So, this doesn't fit the

00:22:31.864 --> 00:22:35.859
observations.
Doesn't fit observations.

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:38.045
So, they said,
all right well maybe that

00:22:38.045 --> 00:22:41.239
doesn't work all that well,
so what we'll do is instead of

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:44.769
imagining that the planets are
on circles around the Earth,

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:48.141
we'll imagine that there are
circles on circles around the

00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:50.329
Earth, and the planets go on
those.

00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:54.380
So, you add a kind of extra
circle here, so the circle goes

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.640
around the Earth and the planet
goes around on that circle.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.520
These circles were called
epicycles.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:09.190
So, add epicycles.
And what happened is they would

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.829
add an epicycle and then they'd
go out and observe some more,

00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:15.079
and in particular,
the Arab astronomers a thousand

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:18.746
years ago.
A thousand years ago the center

00:23:18.746 --> 00:23:22.970
of all science was in the Arab
countries;

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.161
they gave us all their--all our
star names by the way are in

00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:31.210
Arabic, so are mathematical
techniques such as algebra;

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.742
it all comes from the Arabs.
They knew what they were doing

00:23:34.742 --> 00:23:38.059
back then when the Europeans
were kind of in squalor.

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:40.405
And they made these great
observations,

00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:43.984
and every time they made more
observations it turned out it

00:23:43.984 --> 00:23:46.185
didn't fit.
So, they had to add more

00:23:46.185 --> 00:23:48.456
epicycles.
So then, they added one here,

00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:50.550
and one here,
and so on until you had

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.006
circles,
and circles,

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:54.930
and circles,
and circles in order to explain

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:00.200
the observations.
So, add epicycles repeatedly.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.361
And this is kind of
unsatisfying because it's not a

00:24:03.361 --> 00:24:07.281
good thing where every time you
get more or better observations

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:10.190
you have to revise and extend
your theory.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.540
That's not such a great theory.
In fact, the word epicycles has

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.976
now become a kind of a swear
word in the scientific

00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:18.278
community,
meaning a sort of theory that

00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:21.904
has become so complex it's just
ridiculous and you don't want to

00:24:21.904 --> 00:24:24.857
believe it anymore.
So, someone will come up with

00:24:24.857 --> 00:24:27.359
some really seemingly
sophisticated but very

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:30.618
complicated theory and if you
don't like that you just go

00:24:30.618 --> 00:24:36.029
that's just epicycles,
forget about it.

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:41.102
So, this has become a little
bit of a swear word,

00:24:41.102 --> 00:24:45.329
and it was unsatisfactory at
the time.

00:24:45.329 --> 00:24:48.736
Now, let me pause for a moment
and confess that the story I've

00:24:48.736 --> 00:24:52.099
just told you,
which is the standard story

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:57.038
about Ptolemaic epicycles is,
well, it has what I think

00:24:57.038 --> 00:25:00.880
Colbert would refer to as
"truthiness."

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.147
It's a commonly told story that
people like to believe,

00:25:04.147 --> 00:25:07.415
but if you talk to the
historians of science this isn't

00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:09.933
actually how it happened.
And, in fact,

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:13.045
this idea of circles on
circles, on circles that isn't

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:16.584
the way epicycles worked,
they had circles and they did

00:25:16.584 --> 00:25:20.440
get more complicated every time
they fit the observations,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.799
but not by adding more and more
circles.

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.877
They would move the circles
side to side,

00:25:24.877 --> 00:25:27.838
they would have things going at
variable speeds around the

00:25:27.838 --> 00:25:30.299
circle,
all sorts of things but this

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:33.875
little picture that I've just
drawn here has a kind of

00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:37.163
"truthiness" to it.
I would say that this is a

00:25:37.163 --> 00:25:41.115
general issue with the way
scientists describe how science

00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:43.496
works.
We tell these nice anecdotes

00:25:43.496 --> 00:25:45.880
and we put them in the textbooks
too;

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.000
in the little bars that go down
the side of the textbook,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.232
where you get the head and
shoulder shot of the famous dead

00:25:52.232 --> 00:25:54.350
white male scientist and so
forth.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:59.123
And then we tell these stories.
And the historians of science

00:25:59.123 --> 00:26:02.559
hate this because it isn't
actually what happened.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:04.259
Nevertheless,
we persist in telling these

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:06.470
stories, and I've been thinking
about why that is.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:11.432
I think the way to think about
this is what these stories are,

00:26:11.432 --> 00:26:14.032
are fables.
And like any fable,

00:26:14.032 --> 00:26:17.359
the point is not that the story
is true.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:20.758
The point is that it vividly
illustrates a moral,

00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:25.078
which tells you how to behave
or how not to behave and they're

00:26:25.078 --> 00:26:28.499
useful for that reason.
You'll recall the famous fable

00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:31.744
of the ant and the grasshopper.
Grasshopper sings and plays and

00:26:31.744 --> 00:26:34.345
dances all summer long.
The ant is very industrious,

00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:36.109
piles up food,
doesn't have any fun.

00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:39.843
But then in the winter,
the grasshopper starves and the

00:26:39.843 --> 00:26:42.730
ant does fine.
If an entomologist were to come

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.349
along and say but that's not how
ants and grasshoppers behave,

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:49.789
you would correctly say that
he's missed the whole point.

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:53.144
And the point is that it's just
a nice story which illustrates

00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:56.500
certain kinds of behaviors and
whether they're good or bad.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.318
So, here's what I'm going to do;
I'm going to tell these

00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:02.852
stories, but I'm going to label
them fables and I'm going to

00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:06.903
point out the morals explicitly.
And the optional paper is going

00:27:06.903 --> 00:27:10.619
to be: go and take any one of
these things and find out what

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:14.273
really happened and comment
somewhat on the implications of

00:27:14.273 --> 00:27:18.609
the real story for science.
I should say that the biggest

00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:23.089
of these fables is probably the
one about Galileo and the

00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:26.416
Catholic Church,
where the Catholic Church

00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:30.102
oppresses the pioneering
scientist and the scientist

00:27:30.102 --> 00:27:34.150
stands firm against this huge
impersonal bureaucracy,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.490
and the establishment trying to
squelch them and so forth.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.838
The truth of that is actually
very subtle and very interesting

00:27:39.838 --> 00:27:42.564
and I can't go into it now,
among other things because I'm

00:27:42.564 --> 00:27:44.756
not a historian of science,
I'm not the best person to talk

00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:47.150
about it,
but check that out sometime.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:54.814
Anyway, for this
particular--this is the fable of

00:27:54.814 --> 00:28:04.394
the Ptolemaic epicycles and the
moral is that simple theories

00:28:04.394 --> 00:28:06.790
are better.

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:13.874
And you particularly don't like
theories which get more and more

00:28:13.874 --> 00:28:17.109
complicated, the better and
better your data become.

00:28:17.109 --> 00:28:20.015
I should say that the word
simple in there turns out to

00:28:20.015 --> 00:28:23.190
have a technical meaning if you
take a statistics course.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.850
What I mean by simple is
something that has relatively

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.240
few free parameters.
I'll just leave that at that.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.589
You can go talk to the
statisticians about it.

00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:37.365
So, if your theory is getting
overwhelmed by epicycles,

00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:41.420
then you'd better go out and
come up with some other better

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.962
theory.
And so, people tried to do

00:28:43.962 --> 00:28:47.575
that, and the first step along
the way was, of course,

00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:50.504
Copernicus.
Copernicus, as you probably

00:28:50.504 --> 00:28:54.160
recall, decides that the
geocentric model is wrong,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.720
things ought to be
heliocentric;

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.992
the Sun in the middle.
So, you put the Sun in the

00:28:59.992 --> 00:29:02.516
middle and everything,
including the Earth,

00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:04.560
goes in circles around the Sun.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.068
This was revolutionary,
and in fact,

00:29:10.068 --> 00:29:13.002
the title of the book he
published was De

00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:15.799
Revolutionibus Orbium
Coelestium,

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:18.953
which means "of the
revolutions" in the sense of

00:29:18.953 --> 00:29:21.569
"revolving of the celestial
spheres."

00:29:21.569 --> 00:29:25.822
The use of that word revolution
is one of the things that pushed

00:29:25.822 --> 00:29:28.859
the word revolution to its
current meaning,

00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:31.819
meaning overthrowing authority
in some ways.

00:29:31.819 --> 00:29:35.785
Originally, it just meant to
revolve but this was so

00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:40.061
revolutionary that people
started to use the word in the

00:29:40.061 --> 00:29:42.913
other way.
This wasn't actually as great a

00:29:42.913 --> 00:29:45.700
theory as you might think,
because it still needed

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.594
epicycles.
Not as big, not as many,

00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:56.559
but it didn't get rid of the
problem with epicycles.

00:29:56.559 --> 00:30:00.900
And that didn't work itself out
until a generation or two later

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.518
when Kepler came along.
Kepler was a famous astronomer

00:30:04.518 --> 00:30:07.819
and he had in his possession,
because he stole them,

00:30:07.819 --> 00:30:15.577
the best naked-eye results that
had ever been obtained of the

00:30:15.577 --> 00:30:20.279
motions of the planets,
in particular, Mars.

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:29.220
He described these motions in
Three Laws of Planetary Motion.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.160
You can look them all up in a
textbook.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.958
In other kinds of courses we
would have you memorize these

00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:35.549
things;
I'm not going to do that.

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:38.790
The key point here is that
these are not circles;

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.667
they're ellipses around the Sun.
That, it turns out,

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:46.766
gives you a model for planetary
orbits which,

00:30:46.766 --> 00:30:50.710
when you take better and better
data, doesn't change.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.282
They're still ellipses;
you don't need little ellipses

00:30:53.282 --> 00:30:56.379
on top of these ellipses to
explain everything that's going

00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:58.092
on.
So, this now has excellent

00:30:58.092 --> 00:30:59.110
descriptive power.

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:06.312
It really describes what's
going on, and when you make

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:08.778
further observations,
it still describes what's going

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:10.462
on.
It does not have any

00:31:10.462 --> 00:31:13.572
explanatory power in the sense
that if you say,

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:16.470
"why ellipses?"
Kepler had no idea.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.355
That's just the way God made it.
So, it's not in any particular

00:31:22.355 --> 00:31:26.341
way an explanation.
For the explanation you have to

00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:28.860
wait another generation or two
until we get Newton.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.945
Newton writes down three laws
of his own, but these are now

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:40.021
three laws of motion,
not planetary motion in

00:31:40.021 --> 00:31:42.104
particular.
And again, one could write

00:31:42.104 --> 00:31:44.612
these down and memorize them and
learn them, and that would be a

00:31:44.612 --> 00:31:47.282
good thing.
Let me write down one of them,

00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:49.464
the Second Law,
looks like this:

00:31:49.464 --> 00:31:52.562
F = ma,
force equals mass times

00:31:52.562 --> 00:31:55.861
acceleration.
And I write this one down

00:31:55.861 --> 00:32:00.005
simply to point out that that
equation is the entire

00:32:00.005 --> 00:32:04.474
intellectual content of
Introductory Physics for physics

00:32:04.474 --> 00:32:07.563
majors.
If you go take Physics 180 this

00:32:07.563 --> 00:32:11.039
is all that they do and they
spend the whole time.

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.876
It turns out you don't actually
want acceleration,

00:32:12.876 --> 00:32:14.599
that doesn't tell you what you
want to know.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.038
What you want to know is the
trajectory, where the object is

00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:19.283
as a function of time.
Those of you who have taken

00:32:19.283 --> 00:32:22.069
some calculus may recall that if
you take the acceleration,

00:32:22.069 --> 00:32:26.071
and you take an integral twice,
you'd come up with the position

00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:28.976
as a function of time.
So here's what--so in the next

00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:31.509
thirty seconds I'm going to
explain Physics 180 to you.

00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:35.091
You substitute in some kind of
a force, you divide by mass,

00:32:35.091 --> 00:32:37.870
you take two integrals,
and that gives you the

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.779
trajectory of the thing.
That's all you need to know.

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:43.395
Technically,
of course, it's quite hard,

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:46.279
but conceptually pretty
straight-forward.

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:49.456
One of the things that Newton
did with this equation was he

00:32:49.456 --> 00:32:53.226
took a particular force,
namely the force of gravity,

00:32:53.226 --> 00:32:56.829
which he also wrote down a Law
of Gravity.

00:32:56.829 --> 00:33:00.419
That tells you for any given
situation what the force due to

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:02.670
gravity is, substituted it in
here,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.869
and figured out what the
motions of the planets ought to

00:33:05.869 --> 00:33:09.777
be.
And it turns out that he could

00:33:09.777 --> 00:33:17.500
derive Kepler's Laws.
He derives Kepler's Laws.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.056
Very nice.
Now, of course,

00:33:20.056 --> 00:33:22.776
in order to do this he has to
invent calculus,

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:26.021
so it takes a little while.
He was a great genius but even

00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:28.789
so, inventing calculus from
scratch, not something you want

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:29.840
to attempt at home.

00:33:33.089 --> 00:33:37.928
And that was basically the
start of both modern science and

00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:41.476
modern mathematics.
So, this marks the start of

00:33:41.476 --> 00:33:45.204
science in the following
sense--that Newton has to make a

00:33:45.204 --> 00:33:47.599
couple assumptions along the
way,

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:50.460
sort of deep assumptions about
how the world works.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.094
One is that the Universe is
governed by laws,

00:33:55.094 --> 00:33:58.569
and in fact,
by universal laws.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:01.788
What I mean by universal,
in this sense,

00:34:01.788 --> 00:34:06.117
is that they apply everywhere;
that the same law of gravity

00:34:06.117 --> 00:34:09.674
that resulted in the top of my
pen falling to the floor over

00:34:09.674 --> 00:34:13.171
there also is responsible for
the orbits of the planets and

00:34:13.171 --> 00:34:17.130
the motions of the stars.
This was a new idea.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.369
It's very familiar to us by
now, but the idea that the

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:23.610
planets ought to behave
according to the same rules as

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.849
stuff down here on Earth was a
whole new concept.

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:29.539
The other piece of the new
concept is that these laws are

00:34:29.539 --> 00:34:30.740
mathematical in nature.

00:34:34.269 --> 00:34:38.051
This is why science is hard,
because it's hard for human

00:34:38.051 --> 00:34:39.942
beings.
I think it's something to do

00:34:39.942 --> 00:34:42.486
with the way our brains are
wired, to accept that this is

00:34:42.486 --> 00:34:44.122
true.
It's very easy to imagine a

00:34:44.122 --> 00:34:47.949
world in which that's not true.
Go read any fantasy novel.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:51.591
Any fantasy novel has a
situation where the hero or the

00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:55.569
villain, by virtue of their
strength of character influences

00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:59.085
the events around them.
So that is a rule governed by

00:34:59.085 --> 00:35:01.541
laws, perhaps,
that are not mathematical in

00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:04.991
nature, but depend on the moral
character of the individuals

00:35:04.991 --> 00:35:07.586
involved.
Every human culture has such

00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:11.042
stories including our own.
It's very hard to get away from

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:14.359
it, and the idea that there's
just this sort of mathematical

00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:17.788
structure and that your moral
stature has no bearing on what's

00:35:17.788 --> 00:35:20.429
going to happen is kind of hard
to accept.

00:35:20.429 --> 00:35:22.631
Fortunately,
people turn out to be pretty

00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:24.998
good at math,
so we can actually solve these

00:35:24.998 --> 00:35:28.412
problems and move forward.
These two ideas were

00:35:28.412 --> 00:35:33.170
revolutionary and they are the
basis pretty much of all

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.176
science.
So then Newton's laws get

00:35:36.176 --> 00:35:39.190
elaborated on for several
centuries.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:43.484
By the end of the nineteenth
century things are starting to

00:35:43.484 --> 00:35:48.261
come apart a little bit.
There are now problems that

00:35:48.261 --> 00:35:53.369
show up with Newtonian physics.
It's been a big success on the

00:35:53.369 --> 00:35:55.329
whole but there are now
problems.

00:35:55.329 --> 00:36:03.672
And in the early twentieth
century what happens is two new

00:36:03.672 --> 00:36:11.902
laws of physics are invented.
These are the given the names

00:36:11.902 --> 00:36:17.250
quantum mechanics and general
relativity.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:22.335
And the situation with these is
they don't overturn Newton's

00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:26.205
laws, they extend them.
It turns out that in the kinds

00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:29.236
of situations that Newton was
looking at, both quantum

00:36:29.236 --> 00:36:31.980
mechanics and general
relativity, reduced down to

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.978
Newton's law.
So, you have a situation where

00:36:34.978 --> 00:36:38.521
here are Newton's laws,
Ns Laws, of which Kepler's laws

00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:42.860
are a tiny subset.
And then general relativity;

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.742
I'm drawing a kind of Venn
diagram here,

00:36:46.742 --> 00:36:51.422
is here, relativity,
occupying Newton's laws but

00:36:51.422 --> 00:36:56.446
that's some other stuff.
Quantum mechanics looks kind of

00:36:56.446 --> 00:36:57.240
like this;

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.550
extends in a different
direction.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.346
Let me make these axes-specific.
I don't like Venn diagrams when

00:37:06.346 --> 00:37:08.659
they don't tell you what you're
actually plotting.

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:11.482
This is mass,
so heavy things are when

00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:14.173
relativity kicks in.
This is size,

00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:18.620
and so small things are when
quantum mechanics kicks in.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.130
But you can see the problem.
We've got two big theories.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:26.354
You really want those theories
to be encompassed by one yet

00:37:26.354 --> 00:37:29.181
bigger theory.
And that is the current goal of

00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:31.807
theoretical physics,
to try and find the one great

00:37:31.807 --> 00:37:34.862
theory that encompasses both
quantum mechanics and general

00:37:34.862 --> 00:37:37.209
relativity,
which contradict each other in

00:37:37.209 --> 00:37:39.742
various awkward ways,
particularly in this region up

00:37:39.742 --> 00:37:44.019
here.
This is called the Theory of

00:37:44.019 --> 00:37:48.301
Everything, or TOE.
And the best current guess as

00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:51.427
to what kind of a theory that
will be is that it will be some

00:37:51.427 --> 00:37:54.578
kind of string theory.
I won't go into string theories

00:37:54.578 --> 00:37:57.500
now, you can go read many
popular books on this;

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.442
it's very exciting.
There is currently no string

00:38:00.442 --> 00:38:04.058
theory that really works out all
that well but the people who are

00:38:04.058 --> 00:38:07.619
studying this kind of thing like
to believe that that's going to

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:11.219
work out sometime in the future.
This is good.

00:38:11.219 --> 00:38:16.731
We've gone about forty minutes
from the start of science to the

00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:20.110
Theory of Everything,
so we're done.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:25.740
Everything else is a detail and
so the whole rest of the course

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:31.011
is filling in details.
The first of which--so let's

00:38:31.011 --> 00:38:34.712
start on the details.
The first of which,

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:38.059
I want to go back and catch one
of Kepler's Laws.

00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:49.139
And I want to write down the
Newtonian Modification of

00:38:49.139 --> 00:38:56.493
Kepler's Third Law.
That is an equation that looks

00:38:56.493 --> 00:39:01.927
like this: a^(3) =
GMP^(2)/4 π^(2 ) We're

00:39:01.927 --> 00:39:06.901
going to circle this in red.
This is something you're going

00:39:06.901 --> 00:39:09.571
to want to memorize.
This, it turns out to be,

00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:12.767
a basis of a large fraction of
what we're going to do in this

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.650
course.
So, let me explain the symbols;

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:26.940
a is the semi-major axis
of an elliptical orbit.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.570
Remember these orbits are going
to be ellipses;

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.699
here's an ellipse.
The long side is the major axis;

00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:38.809
the short side is the minor
axis.

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:43.777
Half the major axis is the
semi-major axis,

00:39:43.777 --> 00:39:50.764
so this is a right here.
P is the orbital period,

00:39:50.764 --> 00:39:56.934
how long it takes the planet or
whatever orbiting object you've

00:39:56.934 --> 00:40:02.965
got to go around one orbit.
M is the total mass of

00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:08.949
the two things in orbit around
each other, of the orbiting

00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:11.135
bodies.
And the existence of that

00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:13.269
M is why this is Newton's
modification.

00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:15.970
In Kepler's law,
it was always planets going

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.544
around the Sun,
so the mass was always the

00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:21.001
same;
the mass was that of the Sun

00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:24.290
and so it cancelled out.
In general, you can use the

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.491
same equation to deal with
things orbiting the Earth or

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.047
things orbiting the Moon as long
as you put in the right mass

00:40:31.047 --> 00:40:33.765
there.
G is a constant of

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:38.143
nature, the gravitational
constant, and it equals some

00:40:38.143 --> 00:40:41.530
value depending on what units
you use.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.590
And we'll come back to that
later.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:49.079
Four is 4, π is this obscure
number from elementary

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:54.030
mathematics 3.14159 whatever the
heck it is.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:58.380
And you can punch it in on your
calculator or whatever.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.989
So, you can use this equation
to find things out.

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:06.139
Now, these numbers tend to be
awkward to work with.

00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:10.624
The mass of the Sun is some
huge number of kilograms,

00:41:10.624 --> 00:41:15.540
G is a very awkward
number, π is always a mess.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.779
But let me show you a trick.
Consider the Earth's orbit

00:41:18.779 --> 00:41:19.370
around the Sun.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:30.880
The semi-major axis of the
Earth's orbit is a very common

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:36.717
unit in astronomy,
and it's called an Astronomical

00:41:36.717 --> 00:41:44.739
Unit.
It's a unit of length, or AU.

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:48.087
The mass of the Sun,
mass of the Earth plus the Sun

00:41:48.087 --> 00:41:52.031
is mostly the mass of the Sun;
of Sun, is called the solar

00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:54.767
mass obviously,
and it's given this symbol

00:41:54.767 --> 00:41:57.904
M with a little circle
with a dot inside,

00:41:57.904 --> 00:42:03.011
that's the symbol for the Sun.
What's the orbital period of

00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:05.900
the Earth?
A year, thank you very much.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.929
Period of Earth--one year.
That's what a year means;

00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:14.809
it takes a year for the Earth
to go around the Sun.

00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:19.455
So, it must be the case that
one Astronomical Unit cubed,

00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:23.519
is equal to G times the
mass of the Sun,

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:28.309
times one year squared,
that's P^(2) over

00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:32.769
π^(2).
Now, let me show you a trick.

00:42:32.769 --> 00:42:38.706
Take the general equation,
it's a useful trick,

00:42:38.706 --> 00:42:43.610
and divide by the specific
equation.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:48.961
So a^(3) =
P^(2)GM/ π^(2)

00:42:48.961 --> 00:42:55.593
and we're going to divide that
by 1 AU^(3) equals one year

00:42:55.593 --> 00:42:59.362
squared,
G mass of the Sun over

00:42:59.362 --> 00:43:01.422
4π ^(2).
We can do this because these

00:43:01.422 --> 00:43:03.864
two things are equal so we're
dividing both sides of the

00:43:03.864 --> 00:43:06.434
equation by the same amount.
G cancels,

00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:09.030
4π ^(2) cancels;
that's very nice.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:14.600
We end up with a over 1
AU^(3) equals P over one

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.710
year squared,
M over the solar mass.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:23.360
This is just saying that
quantity is a in units of

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.416
an Astronomical Unit.
This quantity is P in

00:43:27.416 --> 00:43:30.333
units of a year.
If this is two years then this

00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:33.291
number will come out to 2,
and this is M in units

00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:37.346
of the mass of the Sun.
So, you can say a^(3) =

00:43:37.346 --> 00:43:40.976
P^(2)M,
providing you're dealing in

00:43:40.976 --> 00:43:47.443
units of the mass of the Sun,
units of one year,

00:43:47.443 --> 00:43:52.826
and units of an AU.
So, this is now much easier to

00:43:52.826 --> 00:43:55.078
work with.
You've got rid of all kinds of

00:43:55.078 --> 00:43:57.658
terrible things,
so let me give you the first

00:43:57.658 --> 00:44:01.188
numerical example of the course.
This will be the last thing we

00:44:01.188 --> 00:44:03.160
do today, namely,
the orbit of Jupiter.

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:09.677
Turns out the distance from
Jupiter to the Sun is about five

00:44:09.677 --> 00:44:12.070
times the distance of the Earth
to the Sun.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.670
So, a of Jupiter is
approximately five times

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:21.766
a, a of Earth;
a of Earth you'll recall

00:44:21.766 --> 00:44:24.480
is this 1 AU so this is about 5
AU.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.329
So, how does this equation work
out?

00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:29.929
You get 5^(3) equals
P^(2)M,

00:44:29.929 --> 00:44:35.010
M is the mass of the
Sun, 1 solar mass.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:40.871
And since Jupiter is going
around the Sun that's equal to

00:44:40.871 --> 00:44:43.252
1.
So, you have 5^(3),

00:44:43.252 --> 00:44:49.034
5 times 5 is 25,25 times 5 is
125, so you end up with 125

00:44:49.034 --> 00:44:53.372
equals P^(2),
so you can answer the question

00:44:53.372 --> 00:44:55.933
now.
What is the orbital period of

00:44:55.933 --> 00:44:59.766
Jupiter in years?
Obviously, that's going to

00:44:59.766 --> 00:45:04.140
equal the square root of 125.
Here's another trick.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.210
What's the square root of 125?
Quickly?

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:12.765
Good, more decimals?
You could type it into your

00:45:12.765 --> 00:45:15.969
calculator though and find out,
but let me make a suggestion.

00:45:15.969 --> 00:45:19.070
Don't take the square root of
125;

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.830
take the square root of 121
instead.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.190
What's the square root of 121?
11.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.594
Much easier, right?
And notice this,

00:45:28.594 --> 00:45:33.140
a of Jupiter is
approximately five,

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:39.551
so 5^(3) is approximately 125,
and it's just as good to say

00:45:39.551 --> 00:45:45.350
121 is equal to the square
root--the square of the period,

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:50.408
and P equals 11 years.
That's the orbital period of

00:45:50.408 --> 00:45:51.866
Jupiter.
All right, so now,

00:45:51.866 --> 00:45:55.101
I'm aware that many of you are
shopping the course today and

00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:57.239
may not be back for future
lectures.

00:45:57.239 --> 00:46:00.186
And so, I want for those people
who have decided against this

00:46:00.186 --> 00:46:03.329
that they'll do something far
more worthwhile with their time,

00:46:03.329 --> 00:46:07.038
I want to leave you with
something you can carry through

00:46:07.038 --> 00:46:10.949
your life from your brief
experience with Astronomy 160.

00:46:10.949 --> 00:46:16.459
And that is the following piece
of advice: Don't take the square

00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:20.220
root of 125, take the square
root of 121.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.731
It's much easier.
This is what the business

00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:26.150
people call thinking outside the
box.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:30.862
Don't do the stupid hard thing.
Do the thing that is just as

00:46:30.862 --> 00:46:35.389
good but requires some thought
first in order to make it easy.

00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:38.153
So, I will leave you with that,
the rest of you I'll see you on

00:46:38.153 --> 00:46:39.353
Thursday morning.

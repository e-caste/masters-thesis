00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.270
Prof: So anyway,
the course I'm going to teach

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.720
is called Financial Theory.
 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.390
I'm going to teach an actual
class.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.494
I'm going to spend the first
half of the class talking about

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:12.350
the course and why you might be
interested in it,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.710
and then I'm going to start
with the course.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.104
There are not that many
lectures available in the

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.400
semester so I'm not going to
waste this one.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.815
So the first half of the class
is going to be about why to

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.680
study it and the mechanics of
the course,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.348
and the second half of the
lecture is going to be actually

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:26.800
the first part of the course.
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.795
It'll give you maybe an idea of
whether you'll find the course

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:30.680
interesting too.
 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.248
So I think I'll turn this--I
won't have too much PowerPoint

00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:36.920
here.
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.141
So you should know that finance
was not taught until ten years

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.110
ago at Yale.
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.605
It was regarded by the deans
and the classically minded

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:51.517
faculty of the arts and sciences
as a vocational subject not

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:55.680
worthy of being taught to Yale
undergraduates.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.230
It was growing more and more
famous,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.926
however, in the world and there
was a band of business school

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:04.144
professors,
Fischer Black,

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:07.239
Robert Merton,
William Sharpe,

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.159
Steve Ross, Myron Scholes,
Merton Miller,

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.209
who had a huge following in
business schools teaching the

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.391
subject,
and whose students went off to

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.159
Wall Street,
and more or less dominated the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.000
investment banking parts of Wall
Street,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.980
and became extremely successful.
 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.510
Finance became the most highly
paid profession.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.786
It became the most highly paid
faculty in the university,

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:35.420
although they were all in
business schools.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.095
There are more physics PhDs
working in finance now than

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:42.780
there are working in physics.
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.946
So this merry band of financial
theory professors didn't really

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.560
believe in regulation.
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.819
They believed markets left
unfettered worked best of all.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.907
They believed in what they
called efficient markets and the

00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:59.888
idea that asset prices reflect
all the available possible

00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:00.739
information.
 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.006
So an implication of that is
that if you want to find out

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.394
whether a company's doing well
or not you don't have to take

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:07.540
the trouble to read all their
financial reports,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.430
just look at their stock price.
 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.774
If you wanted to know whether a
country's doing well or not you

00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:15.901
don't have to study its entire
political system and current

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.199
events,
just look at the general stock

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.620
market of the country and
that'll tell you.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.518
They believed that you could
make as good returns in the

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.627
market as a lay person as you
could as an expert because all

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:29.683
the experts were competing to
try and get the best possible

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.524
price,
and so the price itself

00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:34.485
reflected all their knowledge
and wisdom and opinions and so

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:37.097
the lay person could take
advantage of that by buying

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:37.699
stocks.
 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.990
Everybody should be an
investor, they felt.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.211
A monkey throwing darts at a
dart board would do as well as

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:44.878
any of the greatest experts.
 

00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:48.979
Now, their own theory was
basically contradicted by their

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.299
own experience because all of
them seemed to go out into the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.472
world and invest,
and almost all of them made

00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:59.885
extraordinary returns and made a
huge amount of money all of

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.068
which made them even less
popular in the faculty of arts

00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:04.110
and sciences.
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.828
So, a critical part of their
theory was that the markets were

00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:10.430
so efficient,
driven by people like them who

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.740
are competing to exploit every
advantage,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.479
and therefore compete away
every advantage,

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.757
and by doing that put all the
information they have into the

00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:19.408
prices.
 

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:22.316
The implication of that theory
is that there's an

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.706
extraordinarily clever way of
computing the value of most

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.467
investment assets,
and about deciding when a

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.150
financial decision's a good
thing to do or not,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.056
and that was the heart of what
they taught in these business

00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:36.611
schools,
these algorithms for valuing

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:39.990
assets and making optimal
financial decisions.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.571
One striking thing is that the
people they studied,

00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:49.884
the business people and the
investment bankers they studied

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:52.360
adopted their language.
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.220
So this had never happened in
academia before.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.163
I mean, anthropologists study
primitive tribes and different

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:02.639
kinds of people all the time and
not one of them,

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.320
I venture to say,
has ever taken over all the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.062
language invented by
anthropologists to behave

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:10.438
themselves in their own
societies,

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:15.085
but the business people that
these professors were studying

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:19.730
ended up using exactly the
language created in academia.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.000
Now, Yale was very different.
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.074
There was no divide between
economists and finance people,

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:29.370
the business school finance
people.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.737
At Yale the greatest economists
in Yale's history were actually

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:35.779
very interested in finance.
 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.680
Maybe they were financial
economists to begin with.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.360
So the greatest Yale economist
of the first half of the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.490
twentieth century was Irving
Fisher who you hear a lot about.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.821
He wrote, possibly,
the first economics PhD at

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:47.339
Yale.
 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:50.901
There was no economist to teach
him so he had to write his PhD

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:54.639
with Gibbs, maybe the greatest
American physicist of the time.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.303
There's a building,
as you know,

00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:58.290
on Science Hill named after
Gibbs,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.050
and you'll hear more about his
dissertation in the 1890s,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.300
but he was a mathematical
economist,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.553
an econometrician but he
invented almost all of this

00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:10.980
economics in order to study
finance.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.028
The most famous Yale economist
of the second half of the

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:16.079
twentieth century was James
Tobin,

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:20.230
a famous macroeconomist,
the most famous macroeconomist,

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.334
possibly, of the second half of
the twentieth century after

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:25.019
Keynes,
a great Keynesian.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:28.622
But he got the Nobel Prize for
work he did on finance in

00:05:28.622 --> 00:05:29.410
economics.
 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.120
Finance was incredibly
interesting to him.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.043
So Bob Shiller and I went to
Yale and we basically said to

00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:39.416
the deans,
"There's a long tradition

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:43.379
of finance and economics
hand-in-hand at Yale,

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.639
and so it's not a vocational
subject.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.925
It's actually central to
economics, and central to

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:51.446
understanding the economy,
and central to understanding

00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:52.519
the global economy.
 

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.600
So we'd like to teach it to
Yale undergraduates,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.291
and we believe a few of them
will actually take the

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.658
course,"
and so they agreed to let us do

00:06:00.658 --> 00:06:03.216
it,
and so we've been teaching it

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:05.269
now for the last ten years.
 

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:12.083
So as you know Shiller has been
very critical of the business

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:15.490
efficient markets tradition.
 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.149
He feels that these finance
professors left something

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:19.939
essential out of the whole
story.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.319
What they left out was
psychology.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.490
They left out the idea of fads,
and rumors,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.911
and narratives,
which he thinks has as big an

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:33.420
effect on prices as the hard
information about profits that

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.930
the business school professors
imagined drove profits.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.458
I myself have been quite
critical of the financial

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.290
theory.
 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:50.209
I started off as a straight
pure mathematical economist.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.492
To me economics was almost a
branch of logic and philosophy

00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:56.550
that happened to tell you
something about the world.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.942
So I got my PhD with Ken Arrow,
who you'll hear a lot about

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:02.079
very shortly.
 

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:05.204
And I came to Yale,
I'd been a Yale undergraduate,

00:07:05.204 --> 00:07:08.838
I came back to Yale and I
joined the Cowles Foundation.

00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.110
And the Cowles Foundation's
motto was basically,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.449
"Can we make economics
more mathematical?

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.908
Economics, a social science,
ought to be amenable to

00:07:18.908 --> 00:07:23.045
mathematical analysis just like
physics or chemistry is,"

00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:26.028
and people didn't believe this
at first.

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:29.531
And the Cowles Foundation,
which you'll hear a lot about

00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:33.961
in these lectures,
led the revolution in economics

00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:37.949
transforming it from a verbal
subject,

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:41.170
political economy,
into a mathematical subject.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.300
Well, I decided around 1989
that since I did mathematical

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.351
economics,
and there were all these

00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:50.079
finance people doing all kinds
of mathematical things on Wall

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.990
Street and doing it very
successfully,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.250
I thought I might just check
out what they were doing.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.540
So it might be fun to see what
they were up to.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.471
So I went to Wall Street and I
joined--most people I knew,

00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.990
in fact, professors I knew went
to Goldman Sachs.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.137
There was a famous finance
professor, who I had mentioned

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:10.452
before, named Fischer Black who
was there at the time and he

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:12.139
attracted a lot of people.
 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.769
And so that was the traditional
thing to do,

00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:16.293
but I decided to go to a
littler firm called Kidder

00:08:16.293 --> 00:08:19.584
Peabody,
and it was the seventh biggest

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:22.230
investment bank at the time.
 

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.850
And one thing led to another,
and they decided that they

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.404
wanted to reorganize their
research department in fixed

00:08:29.404 --> 00:08:30.129
income.
 

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.174
And since I was a professor
there, and I did mathematical

00:08:32.174 --> 00:08:33.663
economics,
and I was there for the whole

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.779
year somebody said,
the director of the Fixed

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.850
Income Department said,
"Why don't you take charge

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.902
of it and hire a new Fixed
Income Research Department for

00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:42.230
me.
 

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.936
So I did, and ultimately there
were seventy-five people in the

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:47.940
department.
 

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.428
All the time I was a professor
at Yale.

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:54.779
And after five years Kidder
Peabody,

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:57.240
even though it was a hundred
thirty-five years old,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.200
formed by a famous family,
the name should sound--

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.941
Peabody--familiar to you,
it closed down after a hundred

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:08.038
thirty-five years,
five years after I got there.

00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:10.778
I had to invite the
seventy-five people I'd hired

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:13.690
into my office and say,
"You're fired."

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.663
And then I went next door to
the office next to mine and the

00:09:16.663 --> 00:09:18.830
guy there said,
"You're fired."

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.940
And so that was my first taste
of Wall Street.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.269
And after that six of us
founded a hedge fund called

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:32.023
Ellington Capital Management,
which was a mortgage hedge

00:09:32.023 --> 00:09:36.740
fund, and we had--
I'll tell you a lot about it.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.519
It started after the Kidder
closing as a rather small hedge

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.688
fund,
but it grew into a very big

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:46.105
mortgage hedge fund,
in fact the biggest mortgage

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.250
hedge fund in the country.
 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.230
(Although recently we found out
that practically everybody who

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.428
trades mortgages is basically a
hedge fund.

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:54.301
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
they'll all basically hedge

00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:56.245
funds, so it doesn't mean
anything anymore to say that

00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:57.639
you're a big mortgage hedge
fund.)

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:01.379
But anyway, we almost went out
of business in '98 a subject,

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:03.168
a story I'll tell you at great
length,

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:06.724
and then we just suffered
through this disastrous last

00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:09.240
year or two,
but we're still here.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.508
So these experiences,
of course, have colored my

00:10:12.508 --> 00:10:16.820
understanding of Wall Street and
my approach to the subject.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.174
So I took on,
in my theoretical work,

00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:22.250
finance and economic theory on
its own terms.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.090
I didn't think like Shiller to
introduce psychology into

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.363
economics I just take it on in
its own terms,

00:10:27.363 --> 00:10:29.120
in its own mathematical terms.
 

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.788
And what I found was that there
are two things missing in the

00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:33.889
Standard Theory.
 

00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:37.662
One is that it implicitly
assumes you can buy insurance

00:10:37.662 --> 00:10:38.850
for everything.
 

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.990
It's the assumption that's
called complete markets.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.210
And secondly it leaves out
collateral entirely so you'll

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.047
never see, almost in any single
economics textbook,

00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:52.038
the idea of collateral or
leverage.

00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:54.490
And those, I think,
the idea that you can't get

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.529
insurance for everything and
that you need collateral,

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:59.908
you know, you have to be able
to convince someone you're going

00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:02.325
to pay them back if you borrow
money and collateral is the most

00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:04.860
convincing way of persuading him
he's going to be paid back,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.678
the lender.
 

00:11:05.678 --> 00:11:08.350
Those two things were missing
from the Standard Theory,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:15.370
so I built a theory around
incomplete markets and leverage,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.120
which is a critique of the
Standard Theory.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.970
So in a way Shiller and I have
been vindicated by the crash.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:31.278
I mean, so let me just show you
a picture here.

00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:36.091
Well, maybe I will,
you know, how bad the crash

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:36.720
was.
 

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.908
So let's look at the Dow Jones.
 

00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:45.817
The Dow Jones is an average of
thirty stocks and what their

00:11:45.817 --> 00:11:46.559
value is.
 

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:48.230
We'll talk more about it later.
 

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.650
But here it is back to 1913
moving along breezily going up

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.441
and up and up,
you know, there are a few blips

00:11:57.441 --> 00:12:03.038
which we'll come to later like
this one in 1929,

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:04.820
and then--but look what
happened lately.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.649
Look at that.
 

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:09.062
The Dow Jones was up at 14,000
and it dropped to 6,500,

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.225
something like that,
more than a fifty percent drop

00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:15.070
and now it's gone fifty percent
up again.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.504
So if you believe these finance
professors you'd have to say

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:21.879
that everybody realized that
future profits in America were

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:25.490
going to be less than half what
they thought they were going to

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.750
be before and that's why the
stock market dropped.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.514
And then miraculously when it
hit a bottom everybody figured,

00:12:31.514 --> 00:12:33.590
"Oh, my gosh,
we misunderstood things.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.254
Actually it's not nearly that
bad and things are fifty percent

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:38.787
higher because now people think
that profits really weren't

00:12:38.787 --> 00:12:40.759
going to go,
you know, didn't drop in half,

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.922
didn't drop by fifty percent,
they only dropped by

00:12:42.922 --> 00:12:43.860
twenty-five percent.
 

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.058
And that was the only way,
according to the old theory,

00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:47.158
to explain what happened.
 

00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:49.956
Now Shiller would just say,
"Well,

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:52.090
everybody's--they're crazy.
 

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.698
They got this into their head
that the world was just going to

00:12:54.698 --> 00:12:56.408
be great and then some rumor
started,

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.952
and things were so high,
and the narrative changed and

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:00.826
they thought things were
terrible,"

00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:01.928
and this his story.
 

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:03.600
And I'm not sure how he gets it
to go up again.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:10.480
They changed their mind again.
 

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.100
By the way it's a little bit
better to look at the Dow

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:24.595
correcting for inflation and
then you see that the 1929 crash

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:28.150
looks--
and this is on a log scale,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.000
remember before the Depression
the stock market was so low.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.048
It's grown so much over a
hundred years that it hardly

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:36.480
seemed like anything was
happening.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.917
Well, now in log scale--going
up two of these is multiplying

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:43.636
by ten--
you see that in the Depression

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:47.179
in 1929 through the early '30s
the stock market fell.

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:48.408
I don't remember what it is.
 

00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:50.009
It looks like it's almost two
things.

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:52.895
It looks like it's eighty or
ninety percent,

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:55.849
and the fall this time has been
much smaller,

00:13:55.849 --> 00:13:58.399
fifty percent,
not ninety percent.

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:04.740
So it's a whole thing down but
not two things down.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.769
It's not a whole thing down.
 

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:06.470
It's less than that.
 

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.570
A whole thing down would be the
square root of ten or a third.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.720
It didn't go down two thirds.
 

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.980
It went down less than two
thirds.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.375
It went down fifty percent,
so the actual percentage drop

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:19.408
was much worse in the Depression
than it is now.

00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:21.470
We're going to come back to all
these things.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.278
What else can we get out of
these numbers?

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:27.840
I just want you to notice a
couple other things.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.320
So these numbers are all very
interesting.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.245
If you're mathematical these
are the sorts of things you pay

00:14:32.245 --> 00:14:32.990
attention to.
 

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.053
So these efficient markets
guys, they looked at the change

00:14:36.053 --> 00:14:37.288
in price every month.
 

00:14:37.288 --> 00:14:39.470
So there's a lot to say for
their theory.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.370
They said, "Look,
it goes up and down

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.158
randomly."
 

00:14:42.158 --> 00:14:44.477
In fact we'll see that there
are all kinds of tests about

00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:46.879
whether you can predict it's
going to go up tomorrow on the

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:49.350
basis of how it did yesterday,
and the answer's no.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.808
It's very difficult to predict
whether the stock market is

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:52.629
going up or down.
 

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:54.129
It seems to be random.
 

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:57.764
Well, it's random and they used
to think it was normally

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:58.690
distributed.
 

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.014
A lot of people argued it was
normally distributed,

00:15:01.014 --> 00:15:01.759
but it's hard.
 

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:05.259
You never get these gigantic
outliers if things are normally

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:06.090
distributed.
 

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.269
They're just way too unlikely
to happen.

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:10.807
So Mandelbrot,
who was a Yale professor who

00:15:10.807 --> 00:15:13.534
retired a couple years ago,
although he wasn't when he

00:15:13.534 --> 00:15:15.666
formed his theories,
the inventor of fractals,

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:18.542
he said this couldn't possibly
be a random walk in the

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:21.690
traditional Brownian motion
sense of the word because you'd

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.610
never get these big outliers,
but he offered no explanation

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.945
for why they might be there,
and I don't know if Shiller has

00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:29.870
an explanation either.
 

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.418
I mean, is it that people
suddenly get shocked one day and

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:35.144
then the next week they change
their mind and things aren't so

00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:35.950
bad after all?
 

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.913
But you'll see that the theory
of collateral and margins does

00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:43.559
explain these kinds of things.
 

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:46.100
Let's just look at the Dow.
 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.389
We just looked at the Dow.
 

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:58.350
Let's look at another,
the S&amp;P 500.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.879
Where's the S&amp;P 500?
 

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:12.539
 
 

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:15.028
Here's the S&amp;P 500 data.
 

00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:16.678
Here's the history of the
S&amp;P 500.

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:20.312
It looks very similar to the
Dow, except we have longer

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:23.812
history back to 1871,
so I just want to point out one

00:16:23.812 --> 00:16:26.100
more thing in the S&amp;P 500.
 

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.538
So this is an average of
five-hundred stocks,

00:16:28.538 --> 00:16:31.308
not just thirty,
but it's more or less the same.

00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:36.808
But let's look at the same
thing taking the logarithm and

00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:38.970
check for inflation.
 

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.399
So you see here that there are
these four cycles.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.149
Things seemed low in 1871.
 

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:47.370
They go up and they go down.
 

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.850
Then you've got another up and
a down.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.230
Then you've got another up and
a down.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.460
Then you've another up and a
down.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.460
Four times the same thing has
happened.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.330
Now this could be just
meaningless accidents,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:02.519
but it will turn out that the
demography of the country,

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.259
the baby boom cycle,
we haven't had just one baby

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:09.073
boom we've had four of them,
so this cycle of stock prices,

00:17:09.073 --> 00:17:12.068
which they're each time a
generation long,

00:17:12.068 --> 00:17:14.558
happens to correspond exactly
to the rise,

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:17.970
the different age distribution
in the population.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.920
So another theory of the stock
market,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.999
which wouldn't have been
entertained by these original

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:26.684
financial theorists,
is that demography has

00:17:26.684 --> 00:17:28.348
something to do with the stock
market,

00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:31.352
not information about profits
and returns but the distribution

00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:32.730
of ages in the population.
 

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.410
So I'm not saying this theory
is correct,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.618
although I was one of the
proponents of it,

00:17:37.618 --> 00:17:42.818
but it shows that there's room,
I think,

00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:48.588
in finance for economic things,
for demography to matter,

00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:53.349
for leverage to matter and not
just for expectations about

00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:54.769
future profits.
 

00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:57.298
So let me show you another
picture.

00:17:57.298 --> 00:18:00.730
So this is a second way in
which Shiller became famous.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.632
He said, "Well,
look at housing prices,"

00:18:04.632 --> 00:18:07.259
the Case Shiller Housing Index.
 

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:09.782
So he's also famous because he
had the idea of collecting

00:18:09.782 --> 00:18:10.548
housing prices.
 

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:15.259
So it's quite amazing,
every town has to record,

00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:19.588
by law you have to record in
the town directory,

00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:22.151
and they're often on the
internet, what the price is of

00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:23.480
every sale of every house.
 

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.173
So everybody has it and it's
all publicly available on the

00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:28.585
internet, or most of it is
publicly available on the

00:18:28.585 --> 00:18:29.200
internet.
 

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.327
And nobody thought to gather
all this information together

00:18:32.327 --> 00:18:35.674
and take the average and write
down an index until Shiller did

00:18:35.674 --> 00:18:36.059
it.
 

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:40.048
So here's the Shiller Index.
 

00:18:40.048 --> 00:18:43.267
All right, so you can see that
housing prices were pretty

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:46.599
stable throughout the '80s and
then in and around 2000 they

00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:49.041
started taking off,
so this is when the stock

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.190
market was taking off too.
 

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.390
So Shiller says this is
irrational exuberance.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.640
People just went crazy.
 

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.190
They somehow think things can
never go down,

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.470
and they're just going to keep
going up,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.096
and they keep buying because
they think things are going to

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:02.108
go up,
and it's crazy.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:05.200
Psychology--eventually a new
narrative is going to start.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.790
Somebody's going to say,
"Oh, they've been going up

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.920
so long they can't continue to
go up.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.108
Things have to go down,"
and things went down.

00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:16.224
I think there's something to
psychology so there was

00:19:16.224 --> 00:19:19.278
something missing in the
original finance story.

00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:21.203
The finance guys,
by the way, they would say,

00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.130
"Well, the rise is not so
surprising.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.690
Look at the mortgage rates.
 

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.587
(This is the interest rate you
have to pay if you get a

00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:27.009
mortgage.)
 

00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:31.494
There's been an incredible
decline in mortgage rates over

00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:35.338
the years, so it's less costly
to buy housing.

00:19:35.338 --> 00:19:42.074
If you take the present value
of your expenditures you just

00:19:42.074 --> 00:19:44.279
have to pay less.
 

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:46.318
You pay over a long period of
time,

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.003
and so the interest rate is
less, so the value of the houses

00:19:49.003 --> 00:19:51.689
is worth more because you're
discounting the future benefits

00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:52.598
at a lower rate.
 

00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:54.240
(You'll hear all about
discounting later.)

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.480
So there's no mystery."
 

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.538
On the other hand nothing
happened to interest rates.

00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:01.287
They kept getting lower so
there's no reason why the market

00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:02.328
should have crashed.
 

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:05.298
So, again, this seems like a
vindication for Shiller.

00:20:05.298 --> 00:20:08.892
Now, it also,
in a way, is a vindication for

00:20:08.892 --> 00:20:12.150
my theory which is
non-psychological.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.595
So I'm distrustful a little bit
of psychology because it can be

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:18.038
anything, although I agree it's
important.

00:20:18.038 --> 00:20:22.308
So my theory is when you take a
loan you have to negotiate two

00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:26.720
things, the interest rate and
how much collateral you put up.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.578
Who's going to trust you to pay
back?

00:20:28.578 --> 00:20:31.169
When you buy a house they say,
"You can't just borrow the

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:32.568
whole value of the house."
 

00:20:32.568 --> 00:20:34.845
They say, "Well,
make a down payment of twenty

00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:35.298
percent.
 

00:20:35.298 --> 00:20:37.630
Borrow eighty percent of the
value of a house."

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.250
And so what I say is that
instead of paying all your

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.588
attention to the interest rate
think about the collateral rate.

00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:46.318
Why is it twenty percent that
you have to put down?

00:20:46.318 --> 00:20:48.779
Maybe it should be ten percent
or forty percent.

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:50.965
Well, in fact,
that number changes all the

00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:51.338
time.
 

00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:55.704
So here what I've done is--the
pink line from 2000 to the

00:20:55.704 --> 00:20:59.445
future, that pink line is
Shiller's Housing Index

00:20:59.445 --> 00:21:00.460
inverted.
 

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.299
So you notice the scale on the
right is the housing prices,

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:09.640
but I've inverted it,
and on the left I have the down

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.559
payment percentage.
 

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:16.338
These are non-agency loans.
 

00:21:16.338 --> 00:21:17.210
We'll come back to the graph
later--

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.308
I don't have time to explain
exactly how I got it--

00:21:19.308 --> 00:21:22.519
but what you see is that from
2000 onwards the down payment

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:25.730
people were asked to make to buy
their house got lower,

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.873
and lower, and lower,
and lower and it got down to

00:21:28.873 --> 00:21:29.900
three percent.
 

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.638
You could put down three
percent of the value of the

00:21:32.638 --> 00:21:35.487
house and borrow the other
ninety-seven percent of the

00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:37.259
value of the house to buy it.
 

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:41.208
So amazingly the prices go up
and down just with what's called

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:42.180
the leverage.
 

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.048
So why is it called leverage?
 

00:21:44.048 --> 00:21:46.690
Because the cash you put down
payment,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.625
say ten percent,
you can lever it up and own an

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:50.983
asset that's worth a hundred
even though you put down ten

00:21:50.983 --> 00:21:51.490
dollars.
 

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.538
So you're leveraged 10:1.
 

00:21:52.538 --> 00:21:56.250
If you put down three dollars
and you get a hundred dollar

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.920
house you've leveraged it 30:1
or 33:1.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.118
So that's why it's called
leverage.

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:03.588
So anyway, the point is that
leverage went way up.

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:06.568
The margins kept going down and
down and down and just at the

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:09.612
peak of the housing cycle,
which is the bottom of that

00:22:09.612 --> 00:22:12.933
curve, that's when collateral
started getting tougher and

00:22:12.933 --> 00:22:16.019
people started asking for more
money down again,

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:18.250
and sure enough the prices
turned around.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.858
So if you look at the prices of
mortgages,

00:22:20.858 --> 00:22:24.118
again, the inverse on the
right, and you look at the

00:22:24.118 --> 00:22:27.145
margins on the left,
not for buying houses but for

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:29.077
buying securities--
I don't have time to explain

00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:31.886
this whole graph,
but the blue line is the buying

00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:32.750
securities.
 

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.500
So '98 is a big crisis,
the margins spike up,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.250
I don't have pricing data back
until then.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.259
That's the blue line.
 

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:43.548
And now from 2007 to 2009 you
see the margins spiking up.

00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:47.817
So to buy a toxic mortgage
security investors don't pay

00:22:47.817 --> 00:22:51.608
cash, they borrow part of the
money to buy it.

00:22:51.608 --> 00:22:54.710
They used to put down only five
percent to buy it.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.755
Now they have to put down
seventy percent to buy it on

00:22:57.755 --> 00:22:58.329
average.
 

00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:00.470
Well, what happened to prices?
 

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.172
Prices--this is the inverse of
prices--in 2007 they started to

00:23:04.172 --> 00:23:04.838
collapse.
 

00:23:04.838 --> 00:23:07.578
So this going up means prices
are collapsing.

00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:10.037
So once again,
the margins--tougher margins

00:23:10.037 --> 00:23:13.489
means lower prices and as the
margins came down recently the

00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:15.420
prices have gone up recently.
 

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:22.509
So it's an alternative theory.
 

00:23:22.509 --> 00:23:31.160
So what else do I want to show
you?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.188
So it doesn't mean that the
standard financial theory is

00:23:36.188 --> 00:23:36.920
wrong.
 

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.788
After all, I helped run a hedge
fund.

00:23:38.788 --> 00:23:41.690
Six of us founded it and we've
been in business for fifteen

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.088
years.
 

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.880
We must believe in standard
financial theory because that's

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.950
how we've been making a lot of
our money.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.214
We exploit all those algorithms
and those are the things I'm

00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:52.532
going to teach you,
so I certainly believe it and

00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:57.650
it's very important to teach you
that again this semester,

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.210
but there's more to the theory
than just that.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:06.108
I want to show you one more
thing in the Dow Jones or the

00:24:06.108 --> 00:24:09.259
S&amp;P which I forgot to
mention.

00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:11.900
And where is this?
 

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.299
Oh, I can't get it out of that.
 

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:15.269
Let's try Dow.
 

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:17.730
Okay, so Dow.
 

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.660
Where was the peak of the Dow?
 

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.779
It was right over here.
 

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:24.009
Now what was the date?
 

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:25.480
The date's supposed to flash
here.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.288
So it's October 1st 2007.
 

00:24:31.288 --> 00:24:36.032
So that's when people started
to realize something was wrong

00:24:36.032 --> 00:24:39.250
with the world and things headed
down.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:45.144
Until then nothing bad seemed
to be happening in the world,

00:24:45.144 --> 00:24:50.430
but suppose that you look not
at the Dow, suppose you

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.259
looked--sorry.
 

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:56.253
Here's a graph,
suppose you looked at the

00:24:56.253 --> 00:24:58.950
sub-prime mortgage index.
 

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.108
So you see it's a hundred.
 

00:25:00.108 --> 00:25:01.778
You'll understand what these
things are.

00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:03.983
So a hundred means nobody
thinks there's going to be a

00:25:03.983 --> 00:25:04.400
default.
 

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.623
Over here January 2007,
that's ten months before the

00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:11.288
stock market starts to go
down--before it hits its peak.

00:25:11.288 --> 00:25:13.140
The stock market is still going
up here.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.026
A month later,
this is April 2007,

00:25:15.026 --> 00:25:18.170
a month later the sub-prime
index starts to collapse.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.269
You see it goes from a hundred
to sixty.

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:24.548
We're already--In February or
March 2007.

00:25:24.548 --> 00:25:27.375
So that means the people,
those experts trading

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:30.814
mortgages, already realized
there was a calamity about to

00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:31.490
happen.
 

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.228
This was long before anyone
else perceived anything

00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:36.441
happening,
long before the stock market

00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:38.393
moved,
long before the government did

00:25:38.393 --> 00:25:40.068
anything to correct the problem.
 

00:25:40.068 --> 00:25:43.637
So just as financial theory
says if you pay attention to the

00:25:43.637 --> 00:25:46.358
prices you can learn a lot about
the world.

00:25:46.358 --> 00:25:48.740
The people trading those
things--their life depends on

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.910
fixing the right prices.
 

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.788
Probably they know stuff that
you don't know.

00:25:51.788 --> 00:25:53.529
The prices are going to reflect
their opinion.

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:56.420
If the price collapsed part of
the reason it collapsed,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.680
maybe margins and something had
something to do with it,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.915
but part of the reason it
collapsed was because they knew

00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:03.650
something bad was happening.
 

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.440
So for two and half years we've
known there's going to be a

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.509
major catastrophe in the
mortgage market.

00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:13.390
To go from a hundred to sixty
and since to twenty is a total

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.298
calamity.
 

00:26:14.298 --> 00:26:17.630
So you know that there are one
point seven million people who

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.240
have already been thrown out of
their houses.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.410
Another three and a half
million aren't paying their

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.710
debts and are seriously
delinquent.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.720
Probably all of them will be
thrown out of their houses,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.182
and another four or five
million after them might default

00:26:30.182 --> 00:26:32.118
and have to be thrown out of
their houses.

00:26:32.118 --> 00:26:35.265
So it's a major catastrophe and
the market told us and warned us

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:38.211
about it two and a half years
ago and nobody's done anything

00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:40.843
about it,
basically, until now as we'll

00:26:40.843 --> 00:26:41.509
find out.
 

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:43.635
So it's not that I think
financial theory,

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.798
the standard financial theory
is wrong I think it's incredibly

00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:47.368
useful.
 

00:26:47.368 --> 00:26:54.131
I just think it has to be
supplemented by a more general

00:26:54.131 --> 00:26:56.588
and richer theory.
 

00:26:56.588 --> 00:27:03.255
Maybe I should show you how my
hedge fund has done just so that

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:08.200
you don't think that it was a
total failure.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.048
Oh dear, where is my returns?
 

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:19.618
Here we go, EMG returns,
it's sort of interesting.

00:27:19.618 --> 00:27:22.160
So Kidder Peabody went out of
business in 1994.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.871
There was a tremendous crash in
the market, a low of the

00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:25.710
leverage cycle.
 

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.420
The purple is Ellington,
that's the hedge fund.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.808
You'll see that these are other
investment opportunities.

00:27:31.808 --> 00:27:35.048
The S&amp;P 500 is the green
thing which looked like it was

00:27:35.048 --> 00:27:36.500
doing great for a while.
 

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.964
Emerging markets is the blue
one, and high yield is the green

00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:44.752
one,
and then there are bunch of

00:27:44.752 --> 00:27:48.269
other things like treasuries,
and this is Libor which is what

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:50.450
banks lend to each other at.
 

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.748
So this says if you put your
money into any of those

00:27:52.748 --> 00:27:55.047
strategies,
in Libor, keep lending your

00:27:55.047 --> 00:27:58.876
money each month to a bank and
seeing what interest you get and

00:27:58.876 --> 00:28:01.410
seeing how much money you
accumulate,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.900
or putting your money in
Ellington and looking at the

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.693
purple,
or putting your dollar into the

00:28:05.693 --> 00:28:07.220
stock market and see what
happens,

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.130
the S&amp;P 500,
this is what happens.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.450
So you see there was a crash
here.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.519
You're fired, you're fired.
 

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:18.298
So we start Ellington and
Ellington does great,

00:28:18.298 --> 00:28:21.380
and so we have all these years
we're doing great.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.480
Then '98 there's another crash.
 

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.490
Look what happened.
 

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.190
Overnight, practically,
we lost a huge amount of money.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:28.630
We almost went out of business.
 

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.618
Long Term Capital,
which, by the way,

00:28:30.618 --> 00:28:32.828
was run partly by two Nobel
Prize winners,

00:28:32.828 --> 00:28:35.189
Merton Miller,
not Merton Miller,

00:28:35.189 --> 00:28:37.769
Myron Scholes and Robert
Merton,

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:39.641
two of the guys I mentioned who
were the leaders of the

00:28:39.641 --> 00:28:41.720
financial crisis [correction:
leading finance academics],

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.720
they bankrupted their company
and they went out of business.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.960
And why did they go out of
business?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.297
Because they weren't aware of
the leverage cycle,

00:28:48.297 --> 00:28:48.930
in my view.
 

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.358
Anyway, so the prices collapsed.
 

00:28:51.358 --> 00:28:53.556
Then look it,
all these returns shoot up

00:28:53.556 --> 00:28:56.991
again and the world seems to be
doing great, the stock market,

00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:58.568
everybody's doing great.
 

00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:01.348
Then there's another crisis in
2007.

00:29:01.348 --> 00:29:04.244
Everything plummets all
together this time and then

00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:06.038
everything is going up again.
 

00:29:06.038 --> 00:29:11.660
So it's hard to see this and to
live through that.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.953
So I remember in '98,
for example,

00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:16.108
when there was a margin call.
 

00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:18.848
Our lenders called and said,
"We want more money.

00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:21.138
We don't believe that the
assets are worth as much as they

00:29:21.138 --> 00:29:23.146
were and so the collateral is
not covering the loan

00:29:23.146 --> 00:29:23.868
anymore."
 

00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:25.568
And we said,
"You can't make a margin

00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:25.859
call.
 

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:26.660
It's not legal.
 

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.828
You promised not to change the
margins on us for six months.

00:29:29.828 --> 00:29:30.960
You can't make a margin
call."

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.884
And they said,
"Well, blah,

00:29:31.884 --> 00:29:33.259
blah, blah, we don't really
know about that.

00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:35.279
We're making a margin
call."

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:38.012
So we called up Warren Buffett
and we said, "This is

00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:38.549
terrible.
 

00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:39.460
They're making a margin call.
 

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.089
They can't do this.
 

00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:40.848
We have great bonds.
 

00:29:40.848 --> 00:29:41.900
There's nothing wrong with the
bonds.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.541
They're going to force us to
sell all the bonds to pay them

00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:46.818
the money, and how can they
force us to do that?

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:47.880
They shouldn't force us to do
that.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.167
We've got great bonds,
it's a great business,

00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:50.749
it's a great company and
they're going to run us out of

00:29:50.749 --> 00:29:51.130
business.
 

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.009
You can't let this happen.
 

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:53.808
Warren Buffett why don't you
buy part of the company and save

00:29:53.808 --> 00:29:55.308
us and you'll get rich and it'll
be great."

00:29:55.308 --> 00:29:56.568
He said, "Say that
again."

00:29:56.568 --> 00:29:59.259
And we said,
"Well, they're going to

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:03.358
force us to sell all the bonds
on Tuesday to meet their margin

00:30:03.358 --> 00:30:07.191
call and we'll get terrible
prices for the bonds and we'll

00:30:07.191 --> 00:30:10.250
be driven out of business,
even though they're great

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.930
bonds, just because they're
making a margin call.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.009
You can't let this happen to us.
 

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:15.788
Buy part of the business and
save us and you'll get rich.

00:30:15.788 --> 00:30:17.358
You'll own part of a great
company."

00:30:17.358 --> 00:30:19.272
And he said,
"Hell, it sounds like I

00:30:19.272 --> 00:30:22.000
should just show up on Tuesday
and buy the bonds."

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.288
So we survived.
 

00:30:26.288 --> 00:30:27.519
I'll tell you more about what
we did.

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:31.444
We survived that,
no thanks to Warren Buffett,

00:30:31.444 --> 00:30:36.590
although he had a pretty good
idea, and then we survived the

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.900
last crash.
 

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.203
So we survived all these
crashes, but the fact is things

00:30:41.203 --> 00:30:43.667
go up, they crash,
they go up, they crash,

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:44.569
they go up.
 

00:30:44.569 --> 00:30:46.009
Could it all be my fault?
 

00:30:46.009 --> 00:30:47.970
I decided it can't be all my
fault.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.613
It's got to be there's
something more basic at work and

00:30:50.613 --> 00:30:53.548
that's why I'm going to tell you
about the leverage cycle.

00:30:53.548 --> 00:30:56.390
Now, of course,
I realize that my pet theories

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.994
may not turn out to be right,
although I think more and more

00:30:59.994 --> 00:31:02.848
people are starting to think
there's something to it.

00:31:02.848 --> 00:31:06.567
So I'm not going to spend a
huge portion of the course just

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:08.618
talking about my pet theories.
 

00:31:08.618 --> 00:31:15.940
I mean, I recognize that I have
to teach partly what's standard.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.528
So the course is going to be
divided in the following way.

00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:24.457
I'm going to talk about the
standard no-arbitrage Financial

00:31:24.457 --> 00:31:26.662
Theory,
and I'm going to talk about it

00:31:26.662 --> 00:31:29.065
theoretically and mathematically
and from a practical point of

00:31:29.065 --> 00:31:31.526
view,
because helping to run the

00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:34.176
hedge fund--
lots of the things that I'll be

00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:37.217
teaching are things that we
actually confronted in the hedge

00:31:37.217 --> 00:31:37.630
fund.
 

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.765
And so you'll get the standard
financial theory course taught

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:43.796
from a hedge fund perspective
both theoretically and from a

00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:45.259
practical point of view.
 

00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:47.813
On the other hand,
I've lived now through three

00:31:47.813 --> 00:31:51.308
mortgage crises and so it seems
silly for me not to describe how

00:31:51.308 --> 00:31:54.335
the mortgage market works,
even through you'll find almost

00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:56.400
none of that in any standard
finance textbooks,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.150
how the mortgage market works,
and what's going on,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.340
and what happened in the
crises, and how we survived and

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.848
how other people didn't.
 

00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:06.750
And I'll talk about the
leverage cycle.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.417
I'll also spend some time--I
think it's quite important--on

00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:13.960
the mathematical logic of the
invisible hand argument.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.374
That's the most important
argument in economics that the

00:32:17.374 --> 00:32:20.913
free market does good for the
economy and a huge number of

00:32:20.913 --> 00:32:22.278
people believe it.
 

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:25.663
And part of that argument and
part of the sort of hazy

00:32:25.663 --> 00:32:29.494
knowledge of that argument is
what drives resistance to a lot

00:32:29.494 --> 00:32:31.220
of government programs.
 

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.450
I mean, the government can only
screw things up is what people

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.509
generally believe.
 

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:38.772
Is it a prejudice or is there
some actual argument behind

00:32:38.772 --> 00:32:39.240
that?.
 

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.252
Well, I want to go over that
argument and show you precisely

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:47.538
how it works and how it doesn't
work in the financial sphere.

00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:50.410
And then, I want to talk about
Social Security.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.150
That's one more program.
 

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.098
That's the biggest program in
the budget.

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.134
It's as big as defense and the
two of those are much bigger

00:32:58.134 --> 00:33:00.804
than everything else,
vastly bigger than every other

00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:02.058
thing in the budget.
 

00:33:02.058 --> 00:33:04.818
So I want to talk about Social
Security and should it be

00:33:04.818 --> 00:33:07.477
privatized and should it be
reformed and why did it go

00:33:07.477 --> 00:33:08.130
bankrupt.
 

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.074
It's also an interesting
mathematical problem because

00:33:11.074 --> 00:33:14.300
Social Security critically
involves the belief that things

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.318
will go on forever,
so there's an infinity in it.

00:33:17.318 --> 00:33:20.778
Each generation the young are
paying for the old.

00:33:20.778 --> 00:33:23.031
Nobody would do that if they
thought they were going to be

00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:25.363
the last generation paying to
the old, and when they got old

00:33:25.363 --> 00:33:26.430
nobody would help them.
 

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.724
So Social Security rests on
this world going on forever

00:33:29.724 --> 00:33:32.410
which makes it mathematically
interesting.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.865
Anyway, so I got interested in
it from a theoretical point of

00:33:35.865 --> 00:33:39.435
view and then I got put on all
these National Academy panels on

00:33:39.435 --> 00:33:41.509
Social Security and privatizing.
 

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:44.779
And so I know quite a bit about
it so I might as well talk about

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:47.580
something I know about,
so that's why I'm going to talk

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.358
about that.
 

00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:52.038
All right, so this is too hard
for you to read so let's do

00:33:52.038 --> 00:33:52.490
this.
 

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.150
So let me just give you a few
examples.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.009
Uh-oh, I hope I didn't do a
terrible thing.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:00.880
No.
 

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.971
So let me just give you a few
examples here of the kinds,

00:34:03.971 --> 00:34:06.842
just so you realize there's
something to the Standard

00:34:06.842 --> 00:34:07.450
Theory.
 

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.579
There's a lot to it.
 

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:11.286
So I'm going to give you ten
examples very quickly,

00:34:11.286 --> 00:34:12.639
of the Standard Theory.
 

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.550
So these are things that I'm
guessing you'll have,

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.471
at least some of them,
trouble figuring out how to

00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:20.235
answer now,
but by the end of the course

00:34:20.235 --> 00:34:21.929
this should be totally obvious
to you.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.179
So suppose you win the lottery,
forty million dollars,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.869
it's a hundred million dollars,
the lottery.

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:31.360
Now they always give you the
choice.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.581
Do you want to take five
million a year over twenty years

00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:37.230
or just get forty million
dollars right now?

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:42.130
Which would you do and how do
you think about what to do?

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.260
So now you get tenure at Yale
at the age of 50,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:46.800
say.
 

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.956
You're making a hundred fifty
thousand dollars a year and you

00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:52.059
think professors--
it's going to go up with the

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:54.467
rate of inflation,
and that's about it for the

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:56.679
next twenty years until you
retire.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.063
So that's twenty years of that
and then you're going to live

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:01.570
another twenty years when you're
going to be making nothing.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.559
So how much of the
hundred-fifty-thousand,

00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:06.210
and let's say inflation is
three percent,

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.777
and what you'd like to do is
consume inflation corrected the

00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:13.710
same amount every year after you
retire and before you retire,

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.409
and so how much of the
hundred-fifty-thousand should

00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:19.110
you spend this year and how much
should you save?

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.130
You'll learn very quickly how
to do a problem like that.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.061
Now, President Levin wrote a
few months ago,

00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:28.472
the end of last year if you
remember, he said that,

00:35:28.472 --> 00:35:30.860
"Well, the crisis was bad.
 

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.807
Yale was going to weather it,
but Yale had lost twenty-five

00:35:33.807 --> 00:35:35.739
percent, probably,
of its endowment.

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:37.570
That's five-billion dollars
almost of the

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.400
twenty-three-billion dollar
endowment.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.539
So how much should he choose to
cut?

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.900
It's his decision.
 

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.829
How much should Yale reduce
spending every year?

00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:50.190
The total spending at Yale is a
little over two-billion.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.117
So the endowment goes down by
five-billion what cuts should

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.380
you take to the budget.
 

00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:00.268
Should faculty salaries be cut,
be frozen, should you get three

00:36:00.268 --> 00:36:02.739
TAs instead of four TAs?
 

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:03.210
What should you do?
 

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.730
How big a cut should you take?
 

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:09.349
Now, the same question faced
Yale in 1996 or so.

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:10.449
I've forgotten exactly the year.
 

00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:12.960
Ten or twelve years ago the
previous president,

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.447
Benno Schmidt,
he suddenly noticed that there

00:36:15.447 --> 00:36:18.086
was deferred maintenance,
as he called it,

00:36:18.086 --> 00:36:21.059
a billion dollars to fix the
Yale buildings.

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:23.552
That's why, incidentally,
every year another college gets

00:36:23.552 --> 00:36:23.909
fixed.
 

00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:26.244
They decided there was deferred
maintenance of a billion

00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:26.670
dollars.
 

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.402
A hundred million dollars every
year for ten years had to be

00:36:30.402 --> 00:36:30.909
spent.
 

00:36:30.909 --> 00:36:33.237
The whole endowment then was
three billion,

00:36:33.237 --> 00:36:36.284
and now we had a one billion
dollar deferred maintenance

00:36:36.284 --> 00:36:36.949
problem.
 

00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:39.179
The budget was about one
billion then.

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:42.869
So how much should you cut the
Yale budget at that time?

00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:45.152
So Benno Schmidt said,
"I'm firing fifteen

00:36:45.152 --> 00:36:46.690
percent of the faculty."
 

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.820
He announced he was firing
fifteen percent of the faculty.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.155
That was on the front page of
the New York Times,

00:36:51.155 --> 00:36:52.590
"Yale to fire
faculty."

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.800
Well, did he make the right
decision?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:02.527
Rick Levin took over as
president three months later,

00:37:02.527 --> 00:37:04.510
so probably not.
 

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.010
What mistake did he make in his
calculations?

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.940
What should he have done?
 

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.769
What was the right response?
 

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:13.039
We're going to talk about it.
 

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:15.940
It's not that hard a problem.
 

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.409
Now, let's take a slightly more
complicated one.

00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:21.739
You're a bookie.
 

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:25.090
The World Series is coming up.
 

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:26.639
The Yankees are playing the
Dodgers,

00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:30.708
let's say, and you know that
the teams are evenly matched and

00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:34.775
you've got a bunch of friends
who you know every game will be

00:37:34.775 --> 00:37:38.844
willing to bet at even odds on
either side because they think

00:37:38.844 --> 00:37:40.199
it's a tossup.
 

00:37:40.199 --> 00:37:42.384
Well, one of your customers
comes to you and says,

00:37:42.384 --> 00:37:44.568
he's a Yankee fan,
he's sure the Yankees are going

00:37:44.568 --> 00:37:45.550
to win the series.
 

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.478
He's willing to put up three
hundred thousand dollars to bet

00:37:49.478 --> 00:37:50.610
on the Yankees.
 

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.965
So if the Yankees win he gets
two hundred thousand,

00:37:52.965 --> 00:37:55.699
but if the Yankees lose he
loses three hundred thousand.

00:37:55.699 --> 00:37:59.119
So 3:2 odds he's willing to bet
on the Yankees winning the

00:37:59.119 --> 00:37:59.659
series.
 

00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:00.963
Well, you say,
"This guy's sort of a

00:38:00.963 --> 00:38:01.420
sucker here.
 

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.840
I can take big advantage of him.
 

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.003
On the other hand it's a lot of
money, two hundred thousand I

00:38:07.003 --> 00:38:10.750
might lose if I have to pay off
and the Yankees win.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:15.670
So even though I think that my
expected profit is positive,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.505
because he's putting up three
hundred thousand to make only

00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:18.710
two hundred when they're even
odds,

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.150
in fact--the fact is it's such
a big number I'm a little

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:23.840
worried about that."
 

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.639
So what do you do?
 

00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:26.670
So what can you do?
 

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.481
You've got these friends who
are willing to bet at even odds

00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:33.655
each game by game,
so how much money--Presumably

00:38:33.655 --> 00:38:37.539
the first night you're going to
bet with one of your friends.

00:38:37.539 --> 00:38:39.300
You take the guy's bet,
the customer,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.159
you take his three hundred
thousand.

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:44.059
You promise to deliver him five
hundred back if the Yankees win

00:38:44.059 --> 00:38:45.789
and to keep it if the Yankees
lose.

00:38:45.789 --> 00:38:48.018
What should you do with your
friends?

00:38:48.018 --> 00:38:50.550
Should you bet on the Yankees
with your friends?

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.382
Should you bet on the Dodgers
with your friends and how much

00:38:53.382 --> 00:38:55.590
should you bet at even odds the
first night?

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.793
So the answer is,
well, I don't want to give all

00:38:58.793 --> 00:39:01.173
the answer now,
but so there's a way of

00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:03.934
skillfully betting with your
friends and not betting two

00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:06.594
hundred or three hundred
thousand the first night with

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.150
your friends at even odds.
 

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.690
You bet some different number
than that,

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.324
which you'll figure out how
much to bet so that if you keep

00:39:12.324 --> 00:39:15.007
betting through the course of
the World Series you can never

00:39:15.007 --> 00:39:15.780
lose a penny.
 

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.449
How do you know how much that
is?

00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:20.992
Well, that's the kind of clever
thing that these finance guys

00:39:20.992 --> 00:39:23.768
developed and you're going to
know how to do.

00:39:23.768 --> 00:39:25.940
So let's do another example
like that.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.789
I'm running out of time a
little bit, but an example.

00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:31.476
Suppose there's a deck of
cards, twenty-six red and

00:39:31.476 --> 00:39:32.820
twenty-six black cards.
 

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.300
Somebody offers to play a game
with you.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.929
They say, "If you want to
pick a card and it's black I'll

00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:39.119
give you a dollar.
 

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:41.190
If it's red you give me a
dollar."

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.931
So if I'm picking,
I'm in the black,

00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:44.873
I get a dollar,
it's in the red I lose a

00:39:44.873 --> 00:39:47.760
dollar, I have to throw away the
card after I pick it.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.902
The guy says,
"By the way,

00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:52.690
you can quit whenever you
want."

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.349
So should you pick the first
card?

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:59.449
It looks like an even chance of
winning or losing.

00:39:59.449 --> 00:40:01.777
Let's say you pick the first
card, it's black,

00:40:01.777 --> 00:40:02.760
you win a dollar.
 

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.094
Now the guy says,
"Do you want to do it

00:40:06.094 --> 00:40:07.179
again?"
 

00:40:07.179 --> 00:40:09.949
You picked a black one so
there's twenty-six red left and

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:10.940
twenty-five black.
 

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.280
So now the deck is stacked
against you.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.659
Should you pick another card?
 

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:18.059
Well, it doesn't sound like you
should pick another card.

00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:21.871
But you should pick another
card and I can even tell you how

00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:23.230
many cards to pick.
 

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.405
Even if you keep getting blacks
you should keep picking and

00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:25.780
picking.
 

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.719
So how could that be?
 

00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:27.909
It sounds kind of shocking.
 

00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:31.251
Well, it's going to turn out to
be very simple for you to solve

00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:32.869
half way through the course.
 

00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:35.800
So, a more basic question.
 

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.460
There are thirty year mortgages
now you can get for five and

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.510
three-quarter percent interest.
 

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.327
There are fifteen-year
mortgages you can get for less,

00:40:45.327 --> 00:40:48.280
like five point three percent
interest.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.059
One's lower than the other.
 

00:40:49.059 --> 00:40:50.751
Should you take the
fifteen-year mortgage or the

00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:51.579
thirty year mortgage?
 

00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:52.960
How do you even think about
that?

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.929
Why do they offer one at a
lower price than the other?

00:40:57.929 --> 00:41:00.539
One more example,
suppose you're a bank and you

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:02.130
hold a bunch of mortgages.
 

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.697
That means the people in the
houses, you've lent them the

00:41:04.697 --> 00:41:06.670
money, they're promising to pay
you back.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.706
And you value all those
mortgages at a hundred million

00:41:09.706 --> 00:41:10.280
dollars.
 

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.510
The interest rates go down.
 

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.840
The government lowers the
interest rates.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.260
Half of them take advantage to
refinance.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.199
They pay you back what they owe
and they refinance into a new

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:18.739
mortgage.
 

00:41:18.739 --> 00:41:20.829
So now you've only got half the
people left.

00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:22.675
Let's say all the people had
the same size mortgage and

00:41:22.675 --> 00:41:23.119
everything.
 

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:24.349
Half the people are left.
 

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:28.498
That shrunken pool,
half as big as the original

00:41:28.498 --> 00:41:30.771
pool,
is that worth fifty-million,

00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:33.847
half of what it was before,
or more than fifty-million,

00:41:33.847 --> 00:41:35.369
or less than fifty-million?
 

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:37.119
How would you decide that?
 

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:40.760
Again, this is a question which
might be a little puzzling now,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.438
but actually you should be able
to get the sign of that today

00:41:44.438 --> 00:41:47.659
even,
and we'll start to analyze it.

00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:49.559
So that's what mortgage traders
have to do.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:51.849
They see interest rates went
down.

00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:53.260
A bunch of people acted.
 

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.451
The people who are left in the
pool are different from the

00:41:55.451 --> 00:41:56.719
people who started in the pool.
 

00:41:56.719 --> 00:42:01.599
Now we've got to revalue
everything and rethink it all,

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:04.039
so how should we do that?
 

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:06.757
Let's say you run a hedge fund
and some investor comes to you

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.659
and says, "Oh,
things are terrible.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:13.360
Look at all the money you lost
for me last year.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.112
I know you're doing great this
year and you've made it all back

00:42:16.112 --> 00:42:18.420
that you lost last year,
but I don't want to run that

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:18.820
risk.
 

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.429
So I want to give you my money,
a billion dollars,

00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:23.940
I want to get these superior
returns you seem to earn,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.780
but you have to guarantee that
you don't lose me a penny.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.139
I don't want to run any risk.
 

00:42:29.139 --> 00:42:32.355
I want a principal guarantee
(it's called) that when I give

00:42:32.355 --> 00:42:35.239
you a hundred dollars you'll
always return my hundred

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:36.867
dollars,
and hopefully much more,

00:42:36.867 --> 00:42:38.570
but never less than a hundred
dollars."

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.570
So is there any way to do that?
 

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.420
You know that you've got a
great strategy,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.639
but of course it's risky.
 

00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:44.389
You could lose money.
 

00:42:44.389 --> 00:42:46.239
You've lost money a bunch of
times before.

00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:49.489
So how can you guarantee the
guy that he'll get all his money

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:52.090
back and still have room to run
your strategy?

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.458
Well, it sounds like you can't
do it, but of course a lot of

00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:56.989
people want to invest that way,
so there must be a way to do.

00:42:56.989 --> 00:43:00.699
So you'll figure out--we'll
learn how to do that.

00:43:00.699 --> 00:43:02.530
So, three more short ones.
 

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.659
A scientist discovers a
potential cure for AIDS.

00:43:05.659 --> 00:43:08.380
If it works he's going to make
a fortune.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.360
He started a company.
 

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.248
He's a Yale scientist,
he's--medical school,

00:43:11.248 --> 00:43:12.610
started this startup company.
 

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.489
Yale, of course,
is going to take all his

00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:17.307
profits, but anyway it's his
startup company and if his thing

00:43:17.307 --> 00:43:19.469
really works he's going to make
a fortune.

00:43:19.469 --> 00:43:22.280
If it doesn't work it's going
to be totally zero.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.210
You calculate,
and let's say you believe your

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:26.592
calculation,
that the expected profits that

00:43:26.592 --> 00:43:29.449
he'll make if it works,
the probability of it working

00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:32.376
times the profit,
that expected profit is equal

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:35.340
to the profits of all of General
Electric.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.230
Should his company be worth
more than General Electric,

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:42.713
the same as General Electric,
or less than General Electric

00:43:42.713 --> 00:43:46.039
since it's got the same expected
profits?

00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:49.590
Well, I can tell you the answer
to this one because I think most

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.338
of you would think,
first you'd think,

00:43:51.338 --> 00:43:52.300
"Well, maybe the
same."

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.574
Then you'd say,
"Well, this AIDS thing

00:43:53.574 --> 00:43:54.059
it's so risky.
 

00:43:54.059 --> 00:43:56.000
It's either going to be way up
here or nothing,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.856
and that's so risky,
and General Electric is so

00:43:57.856 --> 00:44:00.617
solid,
probably General Electric is

00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:02.159
worth more."
 

00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:05.510
But the answer is the AIDS
Company is worth more.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.090
So how could that be?
 

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.994
So another question,
suppose you believed in this

00:44:09.994 --> 00:44:13.625
efficient market stuff and you
rank all the stocks at the end

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:17.315
of this year from top to bottom
of which stock had the highest

00:44:17.315 --> 00:44:18.949
return over the year.
 

00:44:18.949 --> 00:44:21.780
It's 2010, let's say 2010,
this year's a weird year.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.280
So let's say you do it in 2010.
 

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.829
All the stocks the highest
return to the lowest return.

00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:30.525
Now, suppose you did the same
thing in 2011 with the same

00:44:30.525 --> 00:44:31.119
stocks?
 

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:35.224
Would you expect to get the
same order, or the reverse

00:44:35.224 --> 00:44:37.159
order, or random order?
 

00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:39.286
Now again, if you believe in
efficient markets and the

00:44:39.286 --> 00:44:43.483
market's really functioning,
the prices are fair and all,

00:44:43.483 --> 00:44:47.735
I'll bet most of you will say,
you won't know,

00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:50.889
but you might say it should be
random the next time,

00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:54.590
because firms only did better
or worse by luck,

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.989
but that's not right either.
 

00:44:55.989 --> 00:44:59.833
So you're going to know how to
answer that question by the end

00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:00.780
of the class.
 

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.983
One last one,
the Yale endowment over the

00:45:02.983 --> 00:45:06.347
last fifteen years has gotten
something like a fifteen percent

00:45:06.347 --> 00:45:07.559
annualized return.
 

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:09.304
A hedge fund,
that I won't name,

00:45:09.304 --> 00:45:12.735
has gotten eleven percent over
the last fifteen years counting

00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:14.929
all its losses and stuff like
that.

00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:19.114
So is it obvious that the Yale
endowment has done better than

00:45:19.114 --> 00:45:20.300
the hedge fund?
 

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.097
Would you say that the Yale
manager is better than the hedge

00:45:23.097 --> 00:45:23.809
fund manager?
 

00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:25.510
Its return was fifteen percent.
 

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.340
The hedge fund only got eleven
percent.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:31.208
So I'm asking the question,
and I would say that David

00:45:31.208 --> 00:45:35.659
Swensen would think about it the
same way I think about it.

00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:42.324
So suppose I even told you that
the Yale hedge fund had lower

00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:46.186
volatility--
the Yale hedge fund?--the Yale

00:45:46.186 --> 00:45:50.260
endowment had lower volatility
than the hedge fund,

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.704
which it surely does,
would that convince you now

00:45:53.704 --> 00:45:58.083
that the Yale endowment had been
managed better than the hedge

00:45:58.083 --> 00:45:58.730
fund?
 

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.324
Well, we're going to answer
this question again,

00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:04.030
and you're going to see that
the answer's a little

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.860
surprising.
 

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.329
It won't be so surprising--I
wouldn't have brought it up

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:07.869
otherwise.
 

00:46:07.869 --> 00:46:12.170
But anyway, that's the kind of
thing that in finance you're

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.949
taught to think about.
 

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:16.996
So the crisis of 2007,
which we're going to spend a

00:46:16.996 --> 00:46:20.347
long time talking about,
I just want to get back to that

00:46:20.347 --> 00:46:21.079
subject.
 

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:24.860
So that list of questions were
the kinds of things that I used

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.516
to teach for years before I was
confident about my theory of

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:30.153
crises,
and this is the kind of

00:46:30.153 --> 00:46:32.369
questions you have to face all
the time in hedge funds,

00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:34.525
and decisions you have to make,
and things you have to tell

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:37.039
investors,
and so that's the basic part of

00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:39.969
the course,
but I want to say more.

00:46:39.969 --> 00:46:43.099
So I want to talk about the
crisis of 2007-2009.

00:46:43.099 --> 00:46:45.210
It started as a mortgage crisis.
 

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.362
Now, how could it be that
everything goes wrong in

00:46:47.362 --> 00:46:47.889
mortgages?
 

00:46:47.889 --> 00:46:49.639
I mean, they're four thousand
years old.

00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:51.289
The Babylonians invented
mortgages.

00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:52.699
What is a mortgage?
 

00:46:52.699 --> 00:46:53.969
You lend somebody money.
 

00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:55.329
They put up collateral.
 

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:58.215
They don't pay you take the
house or you take the guys life,

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.809
he's a slave or something,
but it's the same thing.

00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:03.539
You borrow money and the guy
promises you can confiscate

00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:05.030
something if he doesn't pay.
 

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.949
Four thousand years and we
screwed it up.

00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:10.159
How could that be?
 

00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:14.998
And why should a screw up in
the mortgage market have such a

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:18.280
big effect on the rest of the
economy?

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.420
Were sub-prime mortgages a
terrible idea?

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:25.110
Was there some logic to it?
 

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.039
And how did we get out of the
crisis?

00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:30.925
How is it, that everybody was
saying this is the worst crisis

00:47:30.925 --> 00:47:33.331
since the Depression,
may be another Depression and

00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:35.159
things seem to have turned
around.

00:47:35.159 --> 00:47:37.460
What is it that we did to get
things to turn around?

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.646
I don't think we're out of it
yet, but things are a lot better

00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:40.650
than they were a year ago.
 

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.833
So what is it that the
government did to turn things

00:47:42.833 --> 00:47:43.219
around?
 

00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:45.829
It didn't do nearly enough,
I think, but it did something.

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:47.679
What exactly did it do?
 

00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:51.547
Now, Shiller would talk about
the whole thing was irrational

00:47:51.547 --> 00:47:52.400
exuberance.
 

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.615
I'm going to say it's all the
leverage cycle,

00:47:55.615 --> 00:47:58.760
but anyway so that's the
mortgage crisis.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.760
Now, are free markets good?
 

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.659
I want to talk about the
argument.

00:48:02.659 --> 00:48:06.286
The argument was first made by
Adam Smith about the invisible

00:48:06.286 --> 00:48:06.710
hand.
 

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.704
The modern mathematical
argument is Ken Arrow's,

00:48:09.704 --> 00:48:10.980
my thesis advisor.
 

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.382
And of course everybody knows
that monopoly and pollution and

00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:17.954
things like that interfere with
the free market and they have to

00:48:17.954 --> 00:48:18.920
be regulated.
 

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.550
But the financial markets,
there's no monopoly.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.333
As long as there's no monopoly
and there's no pollution

00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:26.550
shouldn't the free market
function there?

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.757
So I want to go over that
argument and show you what was

00:48:28.757 --> 00:48:30.532
missing in it,
as I said before,

00:48:30.532 --> 00:48:34.393
and then lastly we're going to
talk about Social Security and

00:48:34.393 --> 00:48:37.159
how could that system be going
bankrupt.

00:48:37.159 --> 00:48:38.380
I mean, it just seems shocking.
 

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.179
There's a two-trillion dollar
trust fund that's going to run

00:48:43.179 --> 00:48:47.815
out in 2024 or something and
after that the system will be

00:48:47.815 --> 00:48:48.630
broke.
 

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:49.639
So how did it happen?
 

00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:50.559
Why is it broke?
 

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:51.969
What can we do to fix it?
 

00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:54.239
So George Bush said,
"Well, it's terrible.

00:48:54.239 --> 00:48:57.239
Even if we manage to sort of
get the trust fund rehabilitated

00:48:57.239 --> 00:49:00.190
young people like you are going
to get a two percent rate of

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.739
return.
 

00:49:00.739 --> 00:49:02.344
If you put your money in the
stock market,

00:49:02.344 --> 00:49:04.380
even allowing for the last
crash, over the long haul,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.869
the returns have been six
percent.

00:49:05.869 --> 00:49:07.639
So it's terrible,
Social Security.

00:49:07.639 --> 00:49:09.170
Something's wrong with the
system.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.403
We should privatize it and let
young people like you put your

00:49:12.403 --> 00:49:14.130
money in stocks instead."
 

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.809
Well, Gore, in the debate in
2000 said,

00:49:16.809 --> 00:49:19.275
"You can't do that because
then the old people who are

00:49:19.275 --> 00:49:21.190
expecting their money can't get
paid."

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.949
And both of them agreed that it
was all the baby-boomers' fault.

00:49:24.949 --> 00:49:26.949
People like me we're getting
old, we're going to retire.

00:49:26.949 --> 00:49:28.710
That's why the system's going
to get broke.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.639
So that's the conventional
wisdom.

00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:33.625
All three of those things are
wrong, so we're going to find

00:49:33.625 --> 00:49:34.139
out why.
 

00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:38.110
So in summary,
why study finance?

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.797
It's to understand the
financial system,

00:49:39.797 --> 00:49:41.789
which is really part of the
economic system.

00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:43.639
It's to make informed choices.
 

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:47.250
Is privatizing Social Security
a good or bad thing?

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.949
Is regulation of financial
markets a good thing?

00:49:50.949 --> 00:49:54.688
The language that you learn is
the language that's spoken on

00:49:54.688 --> 00:49:58.681
Wall Street, and was created by
professors and yet practitioners

00:49:58.681 --> 00:49:59.380
use it.
 

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.440
For me it's incredibly fun,
all these little puzzles.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.358
As J.P. Morgan said,
"Money's just a way of

00:50:03.358 --> 00:50:04.340
keeping score."
 

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.844
You have to figure out what
something's worth in the end and

00:50:06.844 --> 00:50:09.094
if you get it right you've
solved the puzzle right and

00:50:09.094 --> 00:50:11.132
it'll help you make good
financial decisions in a

00:50:11.132 --> 00:50:12.110
pensioned career.
 

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.130
That's the standard reason to
take Finance.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.413
Now, the prerequisites of the
course, so I want to make this

00:50:17.413 --> 00:50:19.639
clear, you don't really need
ECON 115.

00:50:19.639 --> 00:50:23.175
It would be helpful because
this logic of the free market

00:50:23.175 --> 00:50:26.018
being good or bad,
that was already started in

00:50:26.018 --> 00:50:26.840
ECON 115.
 

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.030
That's what they call it now,
right?

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.480
It's still called 115.
 

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.139
I used to teach it but I
haven't done it for years.

00:50:33.139 --> 00:50:37.750
So anyway, what you really need
is mathematical self-confidence.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.150
It's not going to be high math.
 

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.097
It's going to be simple math,
but it's relentless over and

00:50:42.097 --> 00:50:42.768
over again.
 

00:50:42.768 --> 00:50:47.434
And I can tell you that every
year there's the five percent of

00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:49.461
you,
let's five or ten out of the

00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:52.713
hundred-twenty are going to just
get bored doing problem after

00:50:52.713 --> 00:50:54.900
problem and you're probably not
that,

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.003
you know, those ten maybe
haven't that much experience

00:50:57.003 --> 00:50:58.909
doing it,
don't feel very confident doing

00:50:58.909 --> 00:51:01.072
it,
stop coming to the class and

00:51:01.072 --> 00:51:03.969
then really have no idea what's
going on.

00:51:03.969 --> 00:51:06.891
My sister is probably much
smarter than I am,

00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:08.750
but she doesn't like math.
 

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.239
She wouldn't take this course.
 

00:51:11.239 --> 00:51:13.456
So if you're not confident
doing little mathematical

00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:15.110
problems just don't take the
course.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.469
You'll save yourself a lot of
trouble.

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:17.710
I don't know how to say this
any better.

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.909
I want to warn you not to do it.
 

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:21.360
It's easy math,
but it never stops.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.010
Every week there's going to be
a problem set.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.869
The exam--there are problem
sets.

00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:28.925
The exam is doing problems just
like the problem sets,

00:51:28.925 --> 00:51:32.097
but if you don't like that,
you know, to me finance is a

00:51:32.097 --> 00:51:33.539
quantitative subject.
 

00:51:33.539 --> 00:51:36.980
What's so beautiful about it in
one aspect I really like is that

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.929
you have these complicated
different things you have to

00:51:39.929 --> 00:51:42.188
weigh,
but at the end you have to come

00:51:42.188 --> 00:51:43.260
up with one number.
 

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.949
What is the price you're
willing to pay for something?

00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:47.469
It's very concrete.
 

00:51:47.469 --> 00:51:50.190
I'm going to take advantage of
the concreteness by turning

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.670
every question into a number.
 

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.440
I hate it when you get on the
one hand and on the other hand.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.659
It's a number.
 

00:51:55.659 --> 00:51:59.730
So if you don't like numbers
it's not a good course to take.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.340
So what are the kinds of things
you have to know?

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.568
You have to understand the
distributive law of arithmetic

00:52:04.568 --> 00:52:07.856
(which, I have little kids and I
see that's not so easy to

00:52:07.856 --> 00:52:08.780
understand).
 

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.860
Anyway, and then you have to
understand the idea of a

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.380
function which is a contingent
plan.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.871
Simultaneous equations;
that's what we do for

00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:15.949
equilibrium in arbitrage.
 

00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:19.119
Taking a derivative,
that's marginal utility.

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:21.514
The idea of diminishing
marginal utility,

00:52:21.514 --> 00:52:23.730
a concave function looks like
that.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:24.989
That's risk aversion.
 

00:52:24.989 --> 00:52:29.360
Bankers invented the logarithm,
compound interest,

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.554
so you have to know what taking
a logarithm and exponential

00:52:32.554 --> 00:52:34.400
means,
and you have to understand how

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.610
to take probability weighted
averages of things.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.436
And we're going to use Excel
for a lot of the problems which

00:52:39.436 --> 00:52:40.300
we'll teach you.
 

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.909
By the end of a day you'll be
better at it than I am.

00:52:43.909 --> 00:52:47.139
So my office hours are four to
six.

00:52:47.139 --> 00:52:49.322
My secretary assistant is
Rendé,

00:52:49.322 --> 00:52:52.077
there's an accent missing as
she always tells me,

00:52:52.077 --> 00:52:52.710
Wilson.
 

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.300
She just started three days ago
but I'm sure she'll be great.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.052
There are going to be two
lectures a week and a TA

00:52:57.052 --> 00:52:57.409
section.
 

00:52:57.409 --> 00:53:00.530
So every Tuesday there'll be a
problem set starting this

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:02.289
Tuesday due the next Tuesday.
 

00:53:02.289 --> 00:53:03.429
There will be two midterms.
 

00:53:03.429 --> 00:53:06.500
There's a lot of stuff to learn
and so I found,

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.039
everybody I think agrees who's
taken the course,

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:10.940
if you take the midterm it'll
focus your mind and make it a

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.706
lot easier,
so I give two of them so you

00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:14.079
only have half the course to
study.

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:16.789
It makes the final much easier
to study for.

00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:19.282
I recognize that some of you
will have problems on one of

00:53:19.282 --> 00:53:20.833
them,
like especially the first

00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:23.018
mid-term,
and if you do vastly worse on

00:53:23.018 --> 00:53:25.880
one exam than the rest I'll tend
to ignore that,

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.985
but most people don't,
by the way, do vastly worse on

00:53:28.985 --> 00:53:30.480
one exam than the rest.
 

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.847
So the final's forty,
the problem set's twenty,

00:53:32.847 --> 00:53:35.010
and the two midterms are twenty
percent.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:37.235
Tuesday to Thursday,
and so all the TA sessions are

00:53:37.235 --> 00:53:39.949
Thursday to Monday so they're
going to start next Thursday.

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:44.030
So you see the classes are
Tuesday-Thursday then the next

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.760
Tuesday.
 

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.760
There's a long time in-between
here so all the TA sessions will

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.389
meet there.
 

00:53:48.389 --> 00:53:50.940
So they're at the same moment
in the class.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.311
There are all these textbooks,
all by the Nobel Prize winners,

00:53:54.311 --> 00:53:56.079
all by those financial greats.
 

00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:59.538
You can buy any one of them,
but I have my own lecture notes

00:53:59.538 --> 00:54:02.820
because as I say I teach a
slightly unconventional course

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.809
and there's a huge list of books
on the crisis.

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.880
Some of them are incredibly
interesting and fun,

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.391
and so they're all on the
reading list you can take a look

00:54:10.391 --> 00:54:10.699
at.
 

00:54:10.699 --> 00:54:15.844
I mean, there's never been a
more fun time to read this stuff

00:54:15.844 --> 00:54:16.360
now.
 

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.070
So course improvements, anyway.
 

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.960
So that's it.
 

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.929
Are there any questions about
how the course runs,

00:54:21.929 --> 00:54:24.771
or how I will run it,
or whether you think you should

00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:26.626
take the course,
or whether your

00:54:26.626 --> 00:54:29.789
preparations--So if you haven't
taken ECON 15 it's okay,

00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:33.181
115, but you've got to be
confident that you can solve

00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:37.079
problems,
otherwise don't do it.

00:54:37.079 --> 00:54:38.329
Any questions?
 

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:39.090
Yes?
 

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.273
Student: So the first
problem set will be assigned

00:54:40.273 --> 00:54:40.590
next Tuesday?
 

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.126
Prof: Yeah,
so next Tuesday it's going to

00:54:42.126 --> 00:54:43.010
be due the Tuesday after.
 

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.161
So I know that's early,
but you probably already know

00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:47.190
whether you're going to take the
course or not.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.980
Yes?
 

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.489
Student: Will you teach
this next year?

00:54:49.489 --> 00:54:51.210
Prof: Will I teach it
next year?

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.858
Actually I probably won't
because I'm going to go on

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.650
leave, but I might,
but probably not.

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:58.860
Someone else will teach it.
 

00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.739
Yep?
 

00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:04.889
Student: Which of the
books do you suggest we buy?

00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:05.900
Prof: They're all good.
 

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.489
They're all famous people
who've written.

00:55:09.489 --> 00:55:14.172
They're trying to sell copies
so they're pitched at a quite

00:55:14.172 --> 00:55:17.000
low level, but they're very
good.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.679
Anyone of them is good.
 

00:55:18.679 --> 00:55:22.230
Merton's book is good.
 

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.090
Steve Ross is a friend of mine.
 

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.400
He used to teach at Yale,
so his book is good.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.563
So any one of those is very
good, but they're not quite at

00:55:29.563 --> 00:55:32.726
the same mathematical level
because they're trying to sell

00:55:32.726 --> 00:55:36.498
thousands of books,
and they stick pretty closely

00:55:36.498 --> 00:55:40.956
to this financial view of the
world that everything is

00:55:40.956 --> 00:55:42.050
efficient.
 

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:42.920
Yes?
 

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.059
Student: Will the taped
lectures be available online?

00:55:46.059 --> 00:55:47.570
Prof: That's a good
question.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:48.639
I don't think so.
 

00:55:48.639 --> 00:55:49.889
No, they're shaking their head.
 

00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:55.434
So it won't be in time for you,
but it will be if you want to

00:55:55.434 --> 00:55:59.780
look back in your old age,
"I was there.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.429
I saw the leverage cycle."
 

00:56:02.429 --> 00:56:03.260
Sorry.
 

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.639
Yes?
 

00:56:05.639 --> 00:56:08.257
Student: Are the lecture
slides posted before or after

00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:08.869
the lecture?
 

00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:11.083
Prof: Oh,
the lecture notes are all

00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:12.920
posted already before the class.
 

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.846
So the first twelve of them are
there, and I'm changing them

00:56:15.846 --> 00:56:17.829
each year so there'll be some
changes.

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:20.155
So last year's first twelve are
there and they might change a

00:56:20.155 --> 00:56:22.402
little bit, but you can already
get an idea of what they're

00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:22.789
about.
 

00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:28.750
This first lecture is not on,
but the rest of them are.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.360
Any other questions?
 

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.130
Yes?
 

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:34.659
Student: When do we sign
up for the TA sections?

00:56:34.659 --> 00:56:36.239
Prof: Oh,
you should be signing up now.

00:56:36.239 --> 00:56:37.570
I don't know how to do this.
 

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.980
It's online or something, right?
 

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:39.900
You sign up online.
 

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.250
Yeah, so you should pick your
sections.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:45.429
We might add another section if
all of you stay,

00:56:45.429 --> 00:56:50.144
but probably you won't,
but if we do we'll add another

00:56:50.144 --> 00:56:51.480
TA section.
 

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.139
Yes?
 

00:56:52.139 --> 00:56:54.090
Student: What's the
grade distribution?

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:54.949
Prof: The grade
distribution?

00:56:54.949 --> 00:56:55.550
I don't know.
 

00:56:55.550 --> 00:57:01.097
The standard Yale junior level
course grade distribution which

00:57:01.097 --> 00:57:05.282
is when I was at Yale things
were much tougher,

00:57:05.282 --> 00:57:08.739
so it's the standard
distribution.

00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:10.760
I don't remember it offhand.
 

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.579
But I'll tell you all about the
distribution at the midterm.

00:57:13.579 --> 00:57:16.646
So there will be a midterm
before--you'll have chance to

00:57:16.646 --> 00:57:19.715
drop the course after the
midterm and then there will be

00:57:19.715 --> 00:57:22.559
another midterm right at the end
of the course.

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:23.760
Yes?
 

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.920
Student: What level of
math and type of math should we

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.079
be comfortable with to take the
course?

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:30.590
Prof: I was trying to
say that.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:31.860
I'm glad you asked me again.
 

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.570
So I went over the things that
you have to know.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:38.063
If you have 3x-4x^(2) you have
to be able to take the

00:57:38.063 --> 00:57:41.090
derivative of that which is
3-8x.

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:44.217
If you've got the log natural
of x you have to take the

00:57:44.217 --> 00:57:44.969
derivative.
 

00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:46.230
It's one over x.
 

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:51.215
If you've got 3x 5=10 and
2x-7=12 you have to be able to

00:57:51.215 --> 00:57:54.389
solve that simultaneous
equation.

00:57:54.389 --> 00:57:57.612
So that's the kind of thing you
have to do, and you have to be

00:57:57.612 --> 00:58:00.675
able to do it quickly and with
total confidence that you're

00:58:00.675 --> 00:58:01.679
doing it right.
 

00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:06.369
And for many of you that's no
problem,

00:58:06.369 --> 00:58:08.492
but for some of you who are
maybe even smarter than

00:58:08.492 --> 00:58:11.440
everybody else that's a problem,
and so you'll have to judge

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.902
yourself whether you can do that
comfortably so you don't have to

00:58:14.902 --> 00:58:17.230
worry about the mechanics of
doing that.

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:23.775
You can think conceptually
about what the question is

00:58:23.775 --> 00:58:24.909
asking.
 

00:58:24.909 --> 00:58:27.960
When does this end,
ten of or quarter of?

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.639
Student: Ten of.
 

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:32.059
Prof: Ten of,
so we have 13 minutes.

00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:35.239
I want to end with one
experiment.

00:58:35.239 --> 00:58:38.949
So (Teaching Assistant),
can you help me with this?

00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:43.456
So this is something we're not
going to have time to figure out

00:58:43.456 --> 00:58:44.619
the answer to.
 

00:58:44.619 --> 00:58:48.650
So I need sixteen volunteers.
 

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:49.860
How about the first two rows?
 

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.699
Why don't you just volunteer.
 

00:58:51.699 --> 00:58:55.719
You'll survive,
and I know it's a drag but

00:58:55.719 --> 00:58:57.190
you'll do it.
 

00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:01.969
What I'm going to do now is I'm
going to run an auction.

00:59:01.969 --> 00:59:04.793
So please stand up and eight of
you go this side and eight come

00:59:04.793 --> 00:59:05.340
over here.
 

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.219
That's okay, you'll be okay.
 

00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:09.219
I know everyone's reluctant to
do this.

00:59:09.219 --> 00:59:10.570
So I only need sixteen.
 

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:12.360
(TA), help me count them.
 

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.807
Two, four, six,
eight, you guys have to come

00:59:14.807 --> 00:59:15.719
the other way.
 

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:21.550
The TAs aren't going to
participate.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:22.750
You're not in this, right?
 

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:24.130
No.
 

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:28.490
Two, four, six,
eight so we only need eight,

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.518
you both sat down.
 

00:59:30.518 --> 00:59:31.599
So would you like to
participate?

00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:32.099
Come on.
 

00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:33.599
We could use another woman here.
 

00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:37.289
Two, four, six,
eight, there are eight of them?

00:59:37.289 --> 00:59:38.780
So can you mix these up?
 

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.385
There are going to be eight
sellers and eight,

00:59:42.385 --> 00:59:44.230
we say seller,
right?

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.380
Buyer, so shuffle them up and
hand one to each.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.751
So we've got eight,
and these are the football,

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.679
they're selling.
 

00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:52.762
So we've got eight sellers and
eight buyers,

00:59:52.762 --> 00:59:56.777
and I don't know whether you've
ever seen this experiment

00:59:56.777 --> 00:59:59.360
before, but shuffle them,
right?

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.070
Student: They're all
sellers though.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.353
Prof: They're all
sellers, but you've got to

01:00:02.353 --> 01:00:02.739
shuffle them.
 

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:04.449
On the other side there's a
number.

01:00:04.449 --> 01:00:09.840
So we've got eight sellers here
and eight buyers.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:17.244
So each seller knows what his
football ticket is worth,

01:00:17.244 --> 01:00:21.360
or hers, so please take one.
 

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.409
Student: I have a seller
one.

01:00:23.409 --> 01:00:24.260
Prof: Oh,
you have a seller one?

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:24.989
That's bad.
 

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:25.659
Student: Yes.
 

01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:26.469
Prof: I'm blind.
 

01:00:26.469 --> 01:00:27.280
Student: Thank you.
 

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.139
Prof: Buyer, thank you.
 

01:00:28.139 --> 01:00:31.159
Does this say buyer and buyer?
 

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:33.909
You should be one short.
 

01:00:33.909 --> 01:00:37.099
Here's an extra.
 

01:00:37.099 --> 01:00:38.949
So there are eight sellers and
eight buyers.

01:00:38.949 --> 01:00:40.619
They've got the football
tickets.

01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:46.050
Each of them knows what the
football ticket is worth to her.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.760
There are three women here and
only two, so these are the

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.679
"hers".
 

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:52.260
She knows exactly what it's
worth to her.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.360
So say it's fifteen.
 

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.719
The football ticket's worth
fifteen.

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:58.788
Now if she can sell it for more
than fifteen she's going to do

01:00:58.788 --> 01:00:59.039
it.
 

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:00.369
She's going to make a profit.
 

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:04.827
If she sells it for less than
fifteen she's not a very good

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:05.519
trader.
 

01:01:05.519 --> 01:01:06.690
She's not going to do that.
 

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.436
She's going to say,
"If I can get more than

01:01:08.436 --> 01:01:10.369
the football ticket is worth I'm
going to sell it.

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:14.590
If I can't get more than it's
worth I won't sell it."

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:17.179
So everybody knows what the
football ticket is worth to

01:01:17.179 --> 01:01:17.659
herself.
 

01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:20.101
All these guys,
they know what the ticket is

01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:21.010
worth to them.
 

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.856
So say someone thinks it's
worth thirty that guy's going to

01:01:23.856 --> 01:01:25.297
say,
"If I can get it for less

01:01:25.297 --> 01:01:27.204
than thirty,
like for fifteen,

01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:28.929
I'm going to get it.
 

01:01:28.929 --> 01:01:30.360
That'll give me a profit of
fifteen.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.233
If I can only get it for forty
I'm sure not going to do that

01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:35.670
because I'm paying more than I
think it's worth.

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:36.539
So you all got that?
 

01:01:36.539 --> 01:01:38.699
You have a reservation value
yourself.

01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:41.179
You don't want to pay more than
it's worth because then you're

01:01:41.179 --> 01:01:43.106
losing money,
and they want to sell it for

01:01:43.106 --> 01:01:45.748
more than they think it's worth
because then they're making

01:01:45.748 --> 01:01:46.159
money.
 

01:01:46.159 --> 01:01:49.989
So nobody knows anybody else's
valuation.

01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:53.766
The information is distributed
completely randomly across the

01:01:53.766 --> 01:01:54.269
class.
 

01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:55.369
Now this is a famous experiment.
 

01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:57.327
I'm not the first one to run
it, although I've done it for

01:01:57.327 --> 01:01:57.739
ten years.
 

01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:00.353
I do it in my graduate class,
in my undergraduate class,

01:02:00.353 --> 01:02:02.585
the undergraduates,
by the way, always do better

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.059
than the graduate students.
 

01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:07.802
So this knowledge is
distributed in the whole

01:02:07.802 --> 01:02:10.456
environment,
and we're going to see what

01:02:10.456 --> 01:02:13.621
happens when I start a chaotic
interaction between all of these

01:02:13.621 --> 01:02:14.539
sixteen people.
 

01:02:14.539 --> 01:02:15.909
What's going to happen?
 

01:02:15.909 --> 01:02:18.711
And you would think it'd be
total chaos and nothing sensible

01:02:18.711 --> 01:02:19.710
is going to happen.
 

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:22.300
And if that does happen it'll
be very embarrassing for me.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.916
But what the efficient markets
guys would say is,

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:27.369
"Something amazing is
going to happen.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:30.306
The market is going to discover
what everybody thinks it's worth

01:02:30.306 --> 01:02:33.242
and figure out exactly the best
and right thing to do and that's

01:02:33.242 --> 01:02:34.780
what's going to happen."
 

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.603
Now, it's hard to believe that
with this little preparation

01:02:37.603 --> 01:02:40.293
that you've had,
zero, zero training,

01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:42.907
zero experience,
and you're only going to have

01:02:42.907 --> 01:02:43.760
two minutes to do this.
 

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.260
So see the class has got eight
minutes to go.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.360
You're going to miss the grand
finale.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.380
Anyway, so you've only got
eight minutes to go.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:54.576
So with only two minutes of
training they're going to get to

01:02:54.576 --> 01:02:56.603
a result,
which if I had to do it myself

01:02:56.603 --> 01:02:58.873
and read all the numbers and
sort them out and sort through

01:02:58.873 --> 01:03:00.829
them would take me much more
than two minutes,

01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:02.130
and all this is going to happen
in two minutes.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:02.849
It's hard to believe.
 

01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:04.280
It probably won't happen this
time.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.570
So here are the rules.
 

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.809
I'm going to put you all
together.

01:03:07.809 --> 01:03:12.391
Start inching your way towards
each other, and try not--now,

01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:15.809
when I say go,
which won't be for two minutes

01:03:15.809 --> 01:03:19.460
you're going to start yelling
out an offer.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.322
So if you think it's worth
fifteen and you're a seller

01:03:21.322 --> 01:03:22.800
you're not going to sell it for
fifteen.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.545
You're going to say give me
twenty, or give me thirty,

01:03:25.545 --> 01:03:26.840
or give me twenty-five.
 

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.219
You're going to try and get as
much as you can.

01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:30.518
You have to yell it out.
 

01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:32.630
The buyers are going to be
making their offers.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.764
When two of you see that
there's a deal you have to shake

01:03:35.764 --> 01:03:38.730
hands, exchange the football,
and leave, and tell your

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:39.849
numbers to (TA).
 

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:42.059
Where's (TA)?
 

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:48.550
(TA), you're going to stand
outside the group that way.

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:52.273
So once you make a deal you
just leave and tell what's

01:03:52.273 --> 01:03:55.436
happened to (TA) who's now
standing back here,

01:03:55.436 --> 01:03:56.489
back there.
 

01:03:56.489 --> 01:03:59.929
So it has to be public outcry.
 

01:03:59.929 --> 01:04:02.400
It's very important that you're
yelling these things publically

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.672
and all the other people can
hear you, and you've only got

01:04:04.672 --> 01:04:05.309
two minutes.
 

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:09.786
Now two minutes sounds like an
incredibly short period of time,

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:12.748
which it is,
but it's much longer than you

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.768
think, wait, quiet here.
 

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.969
You shouldn't trade--I'm giving
you valuable advice--

01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:19.940
you should not trade in the
first ten or fifteen seconds

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.130
because you have to hear what
everybody else is offering.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:25.673
If you trade right away you're
probably doing something really

01:04:25.673 --> 01:04:26.050
stupid.
 

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.961
Two minutes,
though, it sounds short,

01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:30.139
is actually a very long period
of time.

01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:31.190
So be patient.
 

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:34.041
Try to get the best possible
price and we'll see what

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:34.590
happens.
 

01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.639
Any questions about what you're
doing?

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.027
And now, in the heat of the
moment you might be so

01:04:39.027 --> 01:04:41.706
frustrated that you can't sell
when you think it's worth

01:04:41.706 --> 01:04:43.510
fifteen that you sell it for
ten.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.646
I'm going to expose you in
front of all these people if you

01:04:46.646 --> 01:04:50.000
do that, so keep track of what
you think the thing is worth.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.409
All right, any questions
anybody about what is going on?

01:04:53.409 --> 01:04:55.159
So you have two minutes.
 

01:04:55.159 --> 01:04:56.400
Is there a second hand there?
 

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.460
I can't see it.
 

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.780
No?
 

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.059
Student: It's on the
ten, or coming to.

01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:03.639
Prof: Where is it?
 

01:05:03.639 --> 01:05:06.460
Student: Now it's on the
three.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.179
Student: It's moving.
 

01:05:07.179 --> 01:05:08.099
Prof: It's on the three.
 

01:05:08.099 --> 01:05:09.309
I think I see something.
 

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:12.369
When it gets to the four we're
going to start.

01:05:12.369 --> 01:05:14.659
So start, go.
 

01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:44.960
&lt;&lt;students calling out
prices&gt;&gt;

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.340
Prof: Oh, no collusion.
 

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.730
No collusion.
 

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:57.530
&lt;&lt;students calling out
prices&gt;&gt;

01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.010
Prof: Come out and tell
(TA).

01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:00.630
If you made a deal tell (TA).
 

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:08.409
&lt;&lt;students calling out
prices&gt;&gt;

01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:10.400
Prof: How much time is
left?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:17.670
One minute left,
plenty of time,

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.719
one minute.
 

01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:23.380
Any other deal made?
 

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:35.949
Write down the price and the
two, what price they agreed.

01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:39.380
How much time?
 

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:48.510
Twenty-five seconds, stay cool.
 

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.670
How much time?
 

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:52.369
How much time?
 

01:06:52.369 --> 01:06:54.010
I can't see.
 

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.760
Fifteen.
 

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.599
Stay cool.
 

01:06:56.599 --> 01:07:07.217
Don't make any mistakes,
ten, five, four,

01:07:07.217 --> 01:07:13.590
three, two, one,
stop.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:14.599
Did you get all the numbers?
 

01:07:14.599 --> 01:07:30.518
&lt;&lt;students discussing
sales&gt;&gt;

01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:31.369
Prof: Give me back the
tickets.

01:07:31.369 --> 01:07:33.449
Student: Was this
designed to make us look bad on

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:33.789
camera?
 

01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:35.099
Prof: Give me back the
tickets.

01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:36.568
Student: You designed
this to make us look bad on

01:07:36.568 --> 01:07:36.809
camera.
 

01:07:36.809 --> 01:07:39.945
Prof: No,
you're going to look great on

01:07:39.945 --> 01:07:41.199
camera, you are.
 

01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:47.179
Give me all the tickets back.
 

01:07:47.179 --> 01:07:48.789
(TA), you getting done there?
 

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:49.250
Teaching Assistant: Yeah.
 

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.018
Prof: All the tickets.
 

01:07:50.018 --> 01:07:52.199
I need them all back,
all the stuff.

01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:53.909
God, you're big folders here.
 

01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:59.519
These tickets have lasted ten
years until you guys took over.

01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:03.409
They're all crumpled up.
 

01:08:03.409 --> 01:08:06.070
All the tickets,
I need them all back.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.460
You can sit down now.
 

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:14.300
Everybody's reported in?
 

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.760
Now let's see what happened.
 

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:33.039
 
 

01:08:33.039 --> 01:08:35.430
You've got them all?
 

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.649
Five traded.
 

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.988
Teaching Assistant: Five
traded.

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:42.909
Prof: Five bought and
sold.

01:08:42.909 --> 01:08:43.840
So here's what happened.
 

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.750
Here were the numbers.
 

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:48.010
So we have five minutes just to
look at this.

01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:51.195
So all the buyer prices are in
blue, forty-four,

01:08:51.195 --> 01:08:54.451
forty, thirty-six,
you should recognize these you

01:08:54.451 --> 01:08:57.569
buyers, and the red ones were
the sellers.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:01.148
So you notice that every
seller, for everybody there's a

01:09:01.148 --> 01:09:02.840
seller who's underneath.
 

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.488
So it could have happened that
thirty-eight sold to forty-four,

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:08.609
and thirty-four sold to forty
at thirty-seven,

01:09:08.609 --> 01:09:12.810
and twenty-eight sold to
thirty-six at thirty-two.

01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:15.560
You could have had eight trades.
 

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560
So what did happen?
 

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.640
Nothing like that happened.
 

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.399
You had five trades,
five pairs of people traded,

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.738
and there are those three poor
schlumps,

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:26.130
pairs of people at the end
looking despondent,

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:32.427
hopeless, unable to trade,
worried that they were on

01:09:32.427 --> 01:09:33.538
camera.
 

01:09:33.538 --> 01:09:37.319
Now, let's see,
who are the people who traded?

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:43.738
So, (TA), name the buyers who
bought.

01:09:43.738 --> 01:09:45.899
Teaching Assistant: I
don't know the names.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:46.899
Prof: The prices.
 

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:50.895
Teaching Assistant: The
seller got it for nine and

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.750
managed to sell it for twenty
dollars.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.793
It was all quick so I don't
have everybody's name,

01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:57.130
because they were all rushing.
 

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.078
Prof: You got them.
 

01:09:58.078 --> 01:09:58.710
Teaching Assistant: I
got them..

01:09:58.710 --> 01:09:59.390
Prof: That's
everything, great.

01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:00.840
Teaching Assistant: I
just don't have their names.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.408
Prof: Here's what
happened.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:09.238
Mister seller ten sold to
thirty-six at a price of twenty.

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:14.024
Mister seller nine sold to
buyer twenty,

01:10:14.024 --> 01:10:17.460
so nine, there is no nine.
 

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.630
Teaching Assistant: Six.
 

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.590
Prof: Nine sold to
twenty at a price of what?

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.020
Six.
 

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:24.579
Teaching Assistant:
Sorry.

01:10:24.579 --> 01:10:25.170
Prof: That's okay.
 

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:31.118
So seller six sold to twenty at
a price of twenty.

01:10:31.118 --> 01:10:34.313
Student: Yeah,
even though it's cheaper

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.229
&gt;
 

01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:39.359
Prof: No,
no, buyer twenty paid twenty,

01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:41.100
so seller six did well.
 

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.640
We won't ask who buyer twenty
is.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.710
Buyer twenty is going to screw
everything up.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:53.658
So Buyer fourteen through--I
can't read this either.

01:10:53.658 --> 01:10:54.689
Teaching Assistant:
Forty-four.

01:10:54.689 --> 01:10:57.194
Prof: Buyer fourteen
sold to buyer forty-four for

01:10:57.194 --> 01:11:00.050
twenty,
and buyer twenty sold to buyer

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:05.859
forty for twenty-two,
and seller twenty-four sold to

01:11:05.859 --> 01:11:09.828
buyer thirty for twenty-five.
 

01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:13.300
So five people traded,
now which five were they?

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.292
The sellers were ten,
six, fourteen and twenty-four,

01:11:16.292 --> 01:11:19.050
one, two, three,
four, five, the bottom five.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:23.740
The five buyers were
thirty-six, twenty,

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.470
forty-four, forty and thirty.
 

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.400
So basically forty-four,
forty, thirty-six,

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.238
thirty, twenty-six didn't buy,
twenty bought instead.

01:11:34.238 --> 01:11:36.644
So if you look at it,
so it's not quite the way

01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:38.840
theory would have predicted,
but almost.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:47.591
If you look at it,
if you just shuffle the order

01:11:47.591 --> 01:11:53.996
and you put the sellers,
instead of from top to bottom

01:11:53.996 --> 01:11:56.962
you put them from bottom to top,
you get what looks like a

01:11:56.962 --> 01:11:58.750
demand curve and a supply curve.
 

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.038
And so what happened?
 

01:12:00.038 --> 01:12:02.640
All these five people ended up
selling, one,

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.302
two, three, four,
five, those are exactly the

01:12:05.302 --> 01:12:06.029
sellers.
 

01:12:06.029 --> 01:12:09.305
The price they sold for was all
between twenty and twenty-five,

01:12:09.305 --> 01:12:11.524
and the five buyers were
forty-four, forty,

01:12:11.524 --> 01:12:12.738
thirty-six, thirty.
 

01:12:12.738 --> 01:12:16.288
Twenty-six didn't manage to
buy, but twenty bought.

01:12:16.288 --> 01:12:21.538
So what is the theory of the
free market?

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:23.000
The theory of the free market
says,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.918
"This chaotic situation
where they had less than two

01:12:25.918 --> 01:12:28.996
minutes to decide what to do
could be analyzed as if you put

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:32.123
a demand curve together with a
supply curve and there was one

01:12:32.123 --> 01:12:34.210
price that they miraculously
knew.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:35.899
Here it should have been
twenty-five.

01:12:35.899 --> 01:12:38.533
It turned out to be twenty or
twenty-two that all the trade

01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:39.260
took place at.
 

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.109
At that one price you get all
the trades happening.

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:44.698
The people have the highest
valuation buyers they're the

01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:45.970
ones who get the tickets.
 

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:48.720
The people with the lowest
valuation sellers sell it.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.680
So the people who end up with
the tickets are these red guys

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.788
at the top and the blue guys at
the top.

01:12:53.788 --> 01:12:58.801
All the tickets go from the
people who value the stuff least

01:12:58.801 --> 01:13:01.689
to the people who value it more.
 

01:13:01.689 --> 01:13:04.247
So the market has done an
extraordinary thing in two

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:04.750
minutes.
 

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.698
So there was one mistake.
 

01:13:06.698 --> 01:13:10.023
Mister or miss twenty,
whose identity we are

01:13:10.023 --> 01:13:13.423
protecting, although I'm
searching the faces,

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:16.979
mister or miss twenty got a
very bad deal.

01:13:16.979 --> 01:13:20.287
She or he, let's say he,
bought at twenty when the value

01:13:20.287 --> 01:13:21.069
was twenty.
 

01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:22.189
That was a horrible deal.
 

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:26.288
He didn't get any extra out of
it.

01:13:26.288 --> 01:13:29.457
So he should probably have only
bought if the price were lower,

01:13:29.457 --> 01:13:32.420
and then twenty-six would have
bought instead of twenty.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.823
So twenty sort of squeezed his
way into the market,

01:13:34.823 --> 01:13:37.515
so twenty-six and twenty
between them somehow there was a

01:13:37.515 --> 01:13:38.670
slight inefficiency.
 

01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:41.868
But basically with no training,
no background,

01:13:41.868 --> 01:13:44.868
no practice,
these sixteen undergraduates

01:13:44.868 --> 01:13:47.502
managed to reproduce--
they gathered all the

01:13:47.502 --> 01:13:48.890
information in the whole
economy,

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:53.438
and they discovered who were
the eight people who valued the

01:13:53.438 --> 01:13:57.908
tickets the most and they ended
up with all the tickets.

01:13:57.908 --> 01:14:00.229
For me to do it and sort it out
would have taken longer.

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:02.996
The market solves a complicated
problem, and gets information

01:14:02.996 --> 01:14:05.255
incredibly quickly,
and puts things into the hands

01:14:05.255 --> 01:14:07.100
of the people who value it the
most.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.724
And the marginal buyer thought
it was worth about twenty-five

01:14:09.724 --> 01:14:12.130
or twenty and that's what the
price turned out to be.

01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.822
So anyway, we're going to come
back to this parable at the

01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:16.239
beginning of the next class.
 

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:21.000

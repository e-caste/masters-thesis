00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.420
Prof: This is one
family's experience,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.150
and, as Qing said,
it's quite different for

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.861
different people,
but what you should realize is

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.560
that this is one of 300 million
such stories.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.130
The stories may be different
but there's 300 million of them.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.618
That's what the Chinese
government is now saying,

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:32.833
that the one child policy has
averted 300 million births in

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:33.560
China.
 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.719
Their population,
instead of being 1.3 billion

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.930
now, would be 1.6 billion.
 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.820
300 million people is the total
population of the United States.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.603
China has, as they perceive it,
as they claim,

00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:55.732
averted putting another United
States worth of population into

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:56.910
the world.
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.853
That's the significance of
spending two full lectures on

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.612
China,
and we could of course spend a

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:04.798
lot more,
is that China is just so big

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:08.227
that everything that happens
there has these tremendous

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.852
significances,
both on an individual personal

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:13.719
level for each individual or
family that experiences it,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.430
but also on the global level.
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.854
One out of every five human
beings lives in China,

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:23.659
so it is very big.
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.927
We'll talk in a later lecture
explicitly about the one-child

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.141
policy, but there's information
I have to give you today to

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:31.860
understand what it's about.
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.126
Let me just say,
now, that the Chinese

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.558
government is of course well
aware of the human and human

00:01:37.558 --> 00:01:40.500
rights sacrifices of the
individual people,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.680
but they argue that the
benefits outweigh the suffering.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.036
Just to give you a little hint
of the way the government thinks

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:53.616
about it,
and many other people in China,

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:58.030
that the great economic boom
that China has had--

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.435
most economists now around the
world attribute the kick off of

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.180
that to the reduction in
fertility,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.724
that they didn't have to cope
with so many children and that's

00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:11.050
the cause of their economy
taking off.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.467
They perceive that the
one-child policy has allowed

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.294
China to emerge from this
grinding poverty that they were

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.855
in and become a modern--
at least start to become a

00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:23.628
modern nation in the world.
 

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:27.996
Another story--another data set
that I just recently came across

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.699
was--had to do with carbon
emissions.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.008
At a world average of carbon
usage,

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:40.770
which is probably below what
China is actually using,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.870
300 extra million people would
have produced 1.5 billion,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.009
that's billion with a
"b,"

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.436
tons of CO_2 each
year and that's more than the

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.983
total CO_2 production
of an industrial giant like

00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:54.840
Germany.
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.465
If you're looking at this issue
from an environmental point of

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.560
view,
the reduction of people and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.830
their environmental impact
makes,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.400
again, a huge difference.
 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.254
The Chinese,
for instance,

00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:10.038
feel that because of the
one-child policy alone,

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:14.788
they have done more than any
other country to ameliorate the

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:16.639
environmental crisis.
 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.139
That's just a hint of the very
difficult things--

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.782
how do you weigh the story of a
family and 300 million families

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:30.050
like you just heard against
these sort of macro issues.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.500
It is not easy.
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.943
The question I want to set up
today, which is to go backwards,

00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:43.910
is this kind of policy happens
only in China.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.133
This kind of enormous
population, as the Chinese

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:51.110
perceive it, overpopulation,
happens in China really and in

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.580
India in terms of massive stuff.
 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.538
We've talked a little about
India and South Asia.

00:03:56.538 --> 00:04:00.150
The question is,
what's special about China?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.348
Why did this happen in China?
 

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:06.680
Why did, as they perceive it,
population get so out of

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.639
control that the government felt
that they had to introduce such

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.250
a Draconian policy as this,
such a stringent kind of policy.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.836
The flip side of that coin is,
why is China just now digging

00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:25.656
out from the abject poverty that
the people were in when Europe

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:28.610
and America dug out 200 years
ago?

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.680
I mean England started it,
but all of Europe and America

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.120
went through this phase 200
years ago, and why not China?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.158
Of course this is a very,
very hotly contested issue

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.779
among historians.
 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.410
The basic set up of the story
is that in about 1800,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.379
when Malthus was writing,
China was very powerful,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.524
very strong,
a very rich country and the

00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:04.350
West was beginning to be that
way.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.649
The industrial revolution was
just starting in England,

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.954
and you would have seen
enormous differences between

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:12.740
China and say England or Europe
in 1800,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.115
but you would not have been
able to predict which model was

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.122
going to take over the world,
which country was going to

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:20.970
become bigger and stronger in
the future.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.971
China was a very impressive
place in 1800 and Europe was

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.610
beginning to be a very
impressive place in 1800.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.689
Then I may go into a little bit
the history a little bit more.

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.790
By 1840, when the British
invaded with the opium war,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.286
the British started to addict
the Chinese to opium and the

00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:43.810
Chinese government said,
No.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.461
The British cried free trade
and invaded to force China to

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:54.620
accept British opium,
which they got out of India.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.389
That's a separate story which
we may or may not have time for.

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.814
Then in a very short period of
time China goes from being one

00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:07.461
of the dominant countries in the
world to being sort of the pawn

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.519
in the world that the British
start colonizing it,

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.797
the Germans start colonizing
it, the Americans take

00:06:13.797 --> 00:06:15.790
advantage,
everybody starts taking

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.158
advantage of China,
the colonization of China

00:06:20.158 --> 00:06:24.360
starts the dismembering of
China.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.637
Why did this happen is one of
the major issues in world

00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:29.430
history.
 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.786
There's many,
many different points of view

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:34.649
on this, there's ten major
theories or something.

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.307
In this class,
I just have time to unwind one

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:40.875
thread--
one version of the story and

00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:44.348
only one thread of that story
and that's the relationship

00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:48.122
between the population of China,
the wealth of China,

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:50.129
and the poverty of China.
 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.461
This particular thread about
population was obvious to

00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:58.714
Europeans visiting China,
even in the European Middle

00:06:58.714 --> 00:06:59.449
Ages.
 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.528
Marco Polo visited China in the
1200s,

00:07:03.528 --> 00:07:06.350
and he described China's
cultivation,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.911
how every little bit of land
was under very intense

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:11.113
cultivation already,
populousness,

00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:15.601
that the population was already
incredibly dense as viewed

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:18.910
through European eyes of the
same time.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.488
And industry,
the people worked very hard and

00:07:22.488 --> 00:07:26.720
whatever they did they were very
productive at it.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.838
The stories of Kublai Khan and
all that were from Marco Polo

00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:36.783
that he sort of idolized China
as this incredibly rich but

00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:39.300
very, very crowded place.
 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.970
Adam Smith, in the seventeenth
century,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.889
the guy who started modern
economics,

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.250
said "China has long been
one of the richest,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.360
most fertile,
best cultivated,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.291
and most industrious and most
populous countries in the

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:55.639
world" so Adam Smith was
aware of it.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:08:00.300
All of these great scholars of
the late 1700s were looking

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.509
around the world finally.
 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.720
There was enough seafaring;
they could go around the world

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.750
and compare different things,
and try to figure out what was

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.009
the best system for people to
live under.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.324
A few years after Adam Smith,
Malthus writes and he quotes

00:08:14.324 --> 00:08:17.754
the information that Europeans
were getting were mostly from

00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:21.360
Jesuit priests who had gone over
to China to try to convert the

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.350
population.
 

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.519
He quotes one rather well known
Jesuit priest then,

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:31.701
China is "The richest and
most flourishing empire in the

00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:34.418
world," but the priest goes
on,

00:08:34.418 --> 00:08:39.532
but, because of overpopulation,
the people are 'the poorest and

00:08:39.532 --> 00:08:43.490
most miserable of all.'"
Right from way,

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.657
way back, people are aware that
China was basically a very rich

00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:48.485
country,
but because of the huge

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:51.307
population,
the individual families were

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:53.190
often in abject poverty.
 

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.212
While if you looked at the
emperor and the nobles,

00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:02.110
of course, they had enormous
wealth.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.139
These early observers were
certainly correct about the

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:06.570
population issue there.
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.268
We have data from,
say 1750, and China had 500

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:15.548
people per cultivated square
kilometer.

00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:19.556
At the same time Europe had
about 70 people per the square

00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:21.388
kilometer,
so China had to,

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:25.471
on the same farmland,
had to support seven times as

00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.710
many people.
 

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.956
Of course, the numbers are from
1750, so don't take them as any

00:09:30.956 --> 00:09:32.600
kind of exact numbers.
 

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.951
Up to today,
China has something like 20% of

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.899
the world's population.
 

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.908
Because of the one child
policy, the ratio was higher,

00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:44.312
they had more than 20% but now
it's down to about 20% because

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:45.960
India is still coming up.
 

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.278
A lot of the world is still
coming up and China,

00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:50.893
the population is still
increasing but increasing at a

00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:51.928
rather slow rate.
 

00:09:51.928 --> 00:09:57.951
It has now 20% of the world's
population but only 6% to 7% of

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:02.970
the arable land,
the farmable land in the world.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:08.551
The amount of farmland per
person is 0.2 acres per person,

00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:12.860
ten times less than the United
States has.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.548
There's a real problem with
China's population and the

00:10:17.548 --> 00:10:22.327
question is why did China's
population press up against

00:10:22.327 --> 00:10:27.725
their resources and riches of
the land so much more so than in

00:10:27.725 --> 00:10:29.230
say Europe?
 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.565
For most of history,
China's population does not

00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:37.629
look terribly different--
 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.210
you can see this,
that in the Han Dynasty,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.370
which was the first unifying
dynasty of China,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.538
very much the same time as the
Roman Empire.

00:11:00.538 --> 00:11:03.658
It had a population of 50 or 60
million,

00:11:03.658 --> 00:11:05.976
then according to this
reconstruction of China's

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:07.620
history,
and all these reconstructions

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.634
are very iffy,
you notice the population stays

00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:12.418
stable for 1000 years.
 

00:11:12.418 --> 00:11:16.413
Then, during the Song Dynasty,
which is one of the very most

00:11:16.413 --> 00:11:19.572
important dynasties in China,
very successful,

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:22.798
population rises and then it
falls back down again.

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:26.369
Yuan, which are the Mongol
invasions, this decline is

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:30.418
probably very much characterized
by the Mongol invasions.

00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:33.389
The particular dates here are
dates when we have censuses,

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:36.100
when the various emperors took
censuses,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.668
and in between we really don't
know what's happening,

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:42.649
and you're also not sure how
complete these censuses are.

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:44.658
Anyway, the Mongol invasion.
 

00:11:44.658 --> 00:11:47.995
Then it stays constant,
and then sometime in this

00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:51.134
period,
probably there's no census

00:11:51.134 --> 00:11:56.873
really, they don't have any data
between 1400 and 1750 so this

00:11:56.873 --> 00:12:01.908
curve in here is guesswork,
but sometime in the 1700s,

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:06.220
as in Europe,
the population takes off.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.649
Something like this doesn't
look wildly, in shape,

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:13.570
in magnitude it's different,
but in shape it doesn't look

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.740
very different than Europe.
 

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:22.120
In the Han Dynasty 60 million
Chinese--

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.948
1,400 years later in 1393 they
counted 60.5 million people and

00:12:27.948 --> 00:12:33.110
in between the population went
as low as 37 million.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.394
Then as I said the Mongol
invasions decimated the

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:40.442
population and then just--
before the European Black Death

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:44.570
but decimation the same sense as
the European Black Death and

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.629
then it took a long time for
China's population to come back

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:49.178
up.
 

00:12:49.178 --> 00:12:50.830
By the beginning of the Ming
Dynasty,

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.722
one of the also very
flourishing periods in Chinese

00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:56.467
history,
China had maybe 75 million

00:12:56.467 --> 00:12:58.740
people, up from 60 million.
 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.989
Then it starts doubling,
in the next 200 years it

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:07.269
doubles and continues on up.
 

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.509
As in Europe there were major
epidemics.

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:13.923
In the 1640s there was some
major epidemic that we can liken

00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:18.336
to plague, but people really
don't know what kind of disease

00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:19.158
it was.
 

00:13:19.158 --> 00:13:21.878
A Chinese scholar wrote in
1642, "The

00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:24.528
pestilence,"
we don't know what,

00:13:24.528 --> 00:13:28.198
"The pestilence arose
again on a large scale affecting

00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:30.730
eight or nine of every ten
households.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.469
In a household of ten or 20
people all would be afflicted

00:13:35.469 --> 00:13:37.668
and often all would die.
 

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:41.620
At first the bodies were buried
in coffins and next in grasses,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.124
but finally they were just left
in the places where they

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.080
died."
 

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.158
In one big city in 1643 there
were few--

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:53.370
there was basically no signs of
human life in the streets,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.288
"only the buzzing of flies
broke the silence."

00:13:56.288 --> 00:13:59.750
Those are quotes from Chinese
observers.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.765
Very interestingly,
it was at this time in the

00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:06.211
1640s that the Chinese,
having experienced this massive

00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:09.107
disease,
developed a new medical theory

00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:12.240
of disease and epidemics based
on Chi,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.495
and you've all heard of Chi,
which is supposedly sort of the

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:18.750
life force that's involved in
acupuncture and everything.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.270
Their view was that there was
this sort of non-material

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.801
substance,
force, kind of like phlogiston

00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:30.220
in the West and it had to be in
balance,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.070
and when the Chi on heaven and
earth,

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.009
there was Chi in heaven and Chi
on earth,

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:39.354
got disrupted then plague--then
chaos broke out on earth and

00:14:39.354 --> 00:14:42.519
people started dying of various
diseases.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:46.725
Of course you know Americans
have recently become wildly

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:51.620
infatuated with Chinese medicine
and the Chi theory of things and

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.678
acupuncture,
and we can talk a lot about

00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:58.716
that privately if you wish but
the point is it did not help the

00:14:58.716 --> 00:14:59.889
Chinese at all.
 

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:02.440
You can see the birth--the
medical statistics,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.160
again as far as we have them,
and up until recent times from

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.945
the practice of acupuncture you
don't see any form of disease

00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:13.538
lessened at all and the only
thing you see in China,

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.726
and Japan also,
is a tremendous rise in

00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:18.775
hepatitis because of the
transmission from the needles

00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:22.460
because they didn't understand
anything about sterilization.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.955
Then these plagues caused
enormous political changes just

00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:28.158
as in Europe.
 

00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:30.937
The Ming Dynasty,
for instance,

00:15:30.937 --> 00:15:33.370
fell,
possibly as a result of the

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.875
depopulation and chaos of the
plague and that allowed the

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:40.129
Mongol's to come in and set up
their own dynasty.

00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:45.017
I'm sorry the Manchu from
Manchuria, the Manchu to come in

00:15:45.017 --> 00:15:47.590
and set up the Qing Dynasty.
 

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.428
Similarly to Europe,
after one of these decimations

00:15:52.428 --> 00:15:56.923
of the population,
good land became available and

00:15:56.923 --> 00:16:01.767
people moved into the good land
and they had a blossoming of

00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:05.379
wealth and culture even for the
peasants.

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:09.000
It's a cycle not very different
than what Malthus talked about,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.583
balancing the relationship
between the number of people and

00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:14.500
the amount of land available.
 

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.408
Throughout this whole period,
life expectancy was very poor.

00:16:19.408 --> 00:16:23.041
We have scattered statistics,
so a village in the 1790s

00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:26.874
showed that one-third of male
children died in their first

00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:30.908
year of life and half of them
died before they were 20,

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:34.246
and the female situation was
comparable but probably worse

00:16:34.246 --> 00:16:37.450
because of infanticide,
so they're probably counting

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.750
only those that got through the
period of infanticide.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:46.398
Life expectancy was 32 in this
particular village and only 4%

00:16:46.398 --> 00:16:49.600
of the population lived past 65.
 

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.855
Again, it's not terribly
different than what we saw in

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:55.605
the statistic--
the graph for CisAlpine Gall,

00:16:55.605 --> 00:16:59.019
where about a third of the
women are dead before they start

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.610
their reproductive life.
 

00:17:04.048 --> 00:17:10.570
When the Ming came to power
there was still land--unoccupied

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.450
land available.
 

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.112
As Malthus said,
the best land was already used

00:17:15.112 --> 00:17:18.759
for agriculture but there was
less good land still available.

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:24.775
Under the Ming the population
grew, we're talking 1600s into

00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:30.180
1700s, the Ming--I'm sorry that
ends in 1650 or so.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.308
The population grew,
what did the people do?

00:17:32.308 --> 00:17:36.154
They moved onto the marginal
land and that meant higher into

00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:40.130
the mountains on steeper--trying
to farm on steeper slopes.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.230
They cleared forested areas,
they moved into dry areas,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.220
and the result of all this was
enormous soil erosion,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.690
especially on the mountainsides
in the dry areas.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.270
The productivity dropped
because this land is just not

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.798
good and the erosion--the forest
couldn't hold the water anymore.

00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:02.338
The period of China--China's
always had floods,

00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:03.788
it's a big part of the Chinese
history,

00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:06.990
but these really massive,
massive uncontrollable floods

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.480
date from this period where the
people--

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.421
the population increased and
people started going into areas

00:18:13.421 --> 00:18:16.160
where it's ecologically very
unstable,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.820
cutting down the forests and
then when it rains you get these

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.220
enormous floods.
 

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.423
The floods not only--they
devastated the agriculture in

00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:31.327
the lowlands so you not only had
a poorer agriculture per capita

00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:35.759
in the highlands,
but you also reduced the per

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:38.868
capita farming in the lowlands.
 

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:46.410
Again, population growth can
make it difficult for everybody.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.558
Again, like Europe and like
Africa,

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:52.279
American foods,
when they were discovered,

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:54.298
went into China because they,
as I said,

00:18:54.298 --> 00:18:58.268
have something like twice the
caloric content of anything

00:18:58.268 --> 00:18:59.259
except rice.
 

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.737
If you can grow rice,
rice is as good as potatoes or

00:19:02.737 --> 00:19:04.170
just about as good.
 

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.403
China picked up sweet potatoes
especially, peanuts especially,

00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:12.922
some white potatoes,
and they doubled food

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:14.210
production.
 

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.028
Guess what happened?
 

00:19:16.028 --> 00:19:19.429
The population doubled,
so again, the introduction of

00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:23.089
these foods and the tremendous
improvement in agriculture

00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:25.640
didn't help the per capita
eating,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.509
the per capita amount of food
for individuals.

00:19:33.118 --> 00:19:34.880
During this same period,
as people increased,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.340
one farmer could grow more
food, but the people that could

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.710
eat needed more land for
themselves,

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.577
so they moved farther out and
the land under cultivation

00:19:44.577 --> 00:19:47.180
increased by a factor of 4.5
times.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.807
But, again, during this sort of
second round of population

00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:55.067
growth,
one is--when the Ming take over

00:19:55.067 --> 00:19:58.940
and one is after American foods
are introduced,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.880
the erosion becomes extreme.
 

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.330
It's so extreme that,
by 1978, about one-third of all

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.640
arable land in China had to be
abandoned because of erosion.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.288
So, it's an enormous problem in
China.

00:20:16.288 --> 00:20:20.170
This is really--China
experienced Malthus,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.250
what I call Malthus with a
vengeance,

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:31.673
so this is the cultivated land
and you can see that here 1700

00:20:31.673 --> 00:20:41.256
or so basically American foods
come in and you can plant stuff

00:20:41.256 --> 00:20:45.468
everywhere,
and the amount of land under

00:20:45.468 --> 00:20:47.410
cultivation goes up like crazy.
 

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.315
Some of this decline is very
recent, is industrialization,

00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:54.328
cities growing,
and some of it is erosion.

00:20:54.328 --> 00:20:57.575
The land thing looks like an
enormous increase in the amount

00:20:57.575 --> 00:21:00.598
of land available for farming
but here is the per capita

00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:03.769
amount of land,
the cultivated land hectares

00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:08.551
per capita,
where this is simple hectares

00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:11.505
and it grows,
then it crashes,

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:15.099
probably again to do with the
Mongol invasions so just fewer

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:15.710
people.
 

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.000
I'm sorry I've got this
backwards,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.250
it rises here the land per
capita because you just get rid

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.258
of the people and then,
in the modern population

00:21:26.258 --> 00:21:30.308
growth, the land per capita just
crashes down.

00:21:30.308 --> 00:21:36.554
Now it's--this is 0.2 hectares
now were 0.1 hectare per person,

00:21:36.554 --> 00:21:42.295
which is like a quarter of an
acre, a very small amount of

00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:44.308
land per person.
 

00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:48.180
Of course the Chinese realized
this, as well as anybody,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.542
and it was a matter of official
concern during the Ming and the

00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:53.880
Qing dynasties.
 

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.380
In 1790, just before Malthus
wrote,

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.480
a Chinese scholar and high
government official,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.722
Hong Liang-ji,
he started warning the Chinese

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:08.070
about the difficulties that
unchecked population would cause

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.609
as it outraced Chinese
productive capacity,

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:15.390
that's the way he phrased it.
 

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.858
It's clear that the original
understanding of China,

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:22.097
that its population was
pressing really severely against

00:22:22.097 --> 00:22:24.980
its resources,
was accurate but it still

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.971
doesn't explain why was it in
China that you got these

00:22:28.971 --> 00:22:31.380
incredibly dense populations.
 

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.318
Why didn't that happen
elsewhere say in China or

00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:37.369
England?
 

00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:39.328
What jumps to your mind?
 

00:22:39.328 --> 00:22:43.092
Probably a very high fertility,
they had no--in England we

00:22:43.092 --> 00:22:47.184
talked about the late marriage
system and everything which kept

00:22:47.184 --> 00:22:48.440
fertility down.
 

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.470
Americans generally have the
image and Westerners generally

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.292
have the image that the Chinese
reproduce--have a lot of

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:59.775
children all the time;
it's like your grandparents or

00:22:59.775 --> 00:23:00.390
something.
 

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.700
This makes good sense in the
Chinese culture.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.480
The principal goal of life was
to produce sons,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.509
as you've heard over and over
again,

00:23:09.509 --> 00:23:13.820
and this origin of ancestor
worship I think as you just

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.213
said,
goes back at least to the

00:23:16.213 --> 00:23:20.420
second and third millennia B.C.,
so 5000 years,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:25.618
what Qing said is the scholarly
number.

00:23:25.618 --> 00:23:27.578
They did all kinds of things to
get a son,

00:23:27.578 --> 00:23:28.853
adoption was very,
very common,

00:23:28.853 --> 00:23:31.568
you'll read about that in the
reading if you haven't already,

00:23:31.568 --> 00:23:34.380
James Lee talks about very high
rates of adoption,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.509
people who didn't have a son
would get an adoption.

00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:42.150
The filial piety that they had,
a Confucian system,

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.848
which I'll talk about in a
moment, where the older--

00:23:45.848 --> 00:23:48.605
the younger brothers for
instance had to pay absolute

00:23:48.605 --> 00:23:51.944
obedience to the older brothers
and they all had to pay absolute

00:23:51.944 --> 00:23:53.430
obedience to the father.
 

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.050
If a younger brother had a son
and the older brother didn't,

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.980
the younger brother had to give
that son to the older brother.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.288
By modern times that was the
same situation in Qing's family,

00:24:03.288 --> 00:24:06.382
of course that Confucian,
that strict Confucian thing

00:24:06.382 --> 00:24:09.492
doesn't exist anymore,
but in the old days it would

00:24:09.492 --> 00:24:13.088
always be the younger son's no
matter what the biological story

00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:16.336
was it would always be the
younger sons that did not have

00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:17.440
male children.
 

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:25.180
In China, everyone was expected
to marry,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.048
and they married very young in
order to secure a bride because,

00:24:28.048 --> 00:24:31.880
as I mentioned to you,
I think with respect to the sex

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.116
selective abortion,
traditionally China has always

00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:37.480
done away with 10% to 25% of its
females,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.279
so there was always--not always
but as much as we have data,

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:46.029
and so there's always been an
excess of males and a lot of--

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:50.414
they can't get married so they
did all kinds of things to

00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:55.036
secure a bride for a son and
that included getting betrothed

00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:59.064
very,
very young and starting

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:03.720
reproduction as puberty allowed.
 

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.219
It was made worse by the fact
that it was quite acceptable for

00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:10.042
males to take second wives,
or third wives,

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:14.016
or fourth wives down into
concubines and every time one

00:25:14.016 --> 00:25:18.577
male had more than one wife then
some other male got no wife at

00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:19.240
all.
 

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.569
Let's look--so one of the
possibilities is the obvious

00:25:25.569 --> 00:25:28.709
one, is China had very high
fertility, and we'll see if

00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:29.640
that's true.
 

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.868
Here's a bunch of data,
and what this is,

00:25:32.868 --> 00:25:37.324
is the age of the woman and
they don't have much

00:25:37.324 --> 00:25:41.589
reproduction beyond age 40 in
this sample,

00:25:41.589 --> 00:25:46.204
although modernly we would have;
the age of the woman and what

00:25:46.204 --> 00:25:50.269
her rate is per--I guess per
1000 women.

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:54.454
You can see--women start out at
age 20 with a very high rate and

00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:57.910
all these curves with a high
rate of reproduction.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.884
It either goes down a little
bit by age 25 or in some places

00:26:01.884 --> 00:26:04.308
increases a little bit by age
25,

00:26:04.308 --> 00:26:08.769
and then as the woman gets
older fertility drops off,

00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:11.038
there's fewer and fewer
children per year.

00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:14.662
Forty year olds just have fewer
children then 20 or 25 year

00:26:14.662 --> 00:26:17.410
olds, that's a very obvious kind
of thing.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.597
Now these are two different
sets of population and this is

00:26:20.597 --> 00:26:24.009
data from one area of the world,
data from another area of the

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:24.568
world.
 

00:26:24.568 --> 00:26:29.171
One area is all the data from
China with one line from Japan

00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:33.538
and the other set of data is
Europe, and various European

00:26:33.538 --> 00:26:34.630
countries.
 

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.480
Guess which is which?
 

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.230
Some hands;
a big difference in fertility.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.230
Student:  Is China the
one on the bottom?

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.029
Prof: You think China's
the one at the bottom.

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:52.480
Student:  One of the
articles they're talking about

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.462
how a lot--
like some of these families

00:26:55.462 --> 00:27:00.670
actually have low fertility
because of marital restraint.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.140
Prof: That's right,
that's the Lee article.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.683
We're one lecture behind as
you've probably realized

00:27:05.683 --> 00:27:09.991
already, and so the reading that
you should do tonight actually

00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:11.730
gave away the answer.
 

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.682
Yes, this is the European
population, this is the Chinese

00:27:15.682 --> 00:27:16.598
population.
 

00:27:16.598 --> 00:27:18.320
The Chinese,
once married,

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.484
within marriage,
and in both places extramarital

00:27:21.484 --> 00:27:23.940
fertility is not a big deal so
this is--

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.941
you can take this as general
reproduction but within marriage

00:27:27.941 --> 00:27:31.942
the Europeans had a much higher
rate of childbearing then the

00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:33.009
Chinese did.
 

00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:36.833
In fact, it's almost a factor
of two, from 200 to 300,

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:39.430
from 400 to 500 that it was a
lot.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.271
The Europeans,
once married once having access

00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:48.140
to sex really had children
uncontrollably as one says,

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:53.588
whereas, the Chinese were doing
something to control their

00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:54.450
births.
 

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.930
That was a shocker when this
data came out,

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.618
it's fairly recent data,
because the presumption,

00:27:59.618 --> 00:28:03.102
from at least Malthus' time,
was that the Chinese just

00:28:03.102 --> 00:28:06.781
reproduced like flies or
something and that the Europeans

00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:10.724
had this wonderful restraint and
it turns out that's just the

00:28:10.724 --> 00:28:12.960
opposite of what it is true.
 

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.790
It's very surprising given the
cultural emphasis on

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.288
reproduction by the Chinese.
 

00:28:22.288 --> 00:28:26.792
One of the big issues now under
discussion is whether this is a

00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:31.078
sign whether the Chinese were
consciously doing some kind of

00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:33.998
birth control,
they were consciously trying to

00:28:33.998 --> 00:28:36.553
limit their families,
or whether it was one of these

00:28:36.553 --> 00:28:39.144
cultural things where the
culture in some sense stumbles

00:28:39.144 --> 00:28:41.828
onto a practice and it makes
that culture successful,

00:28:41.828 --> 00:28:45.358
even though the people have no
idea what the purpose of it is.

00:28:45.358 --> 00:28:48.690
It may just be sort of an
artifact of culture and they

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.818
will think,
the population will think this

00:28:51.818 --> 00:28:56.170
is due to their following God's
rules or proper decorum,

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.445
or various cultural reasons,
they will give you cultural

00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:01.710
reasons why they have few
children,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.913
and not understand that that's
what makes the whole society

00:29:05.913 --> 00:29:06.640
survive.
 

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.931
James Lee, who is definitely
the world's foremost demographer

00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:15.395
of China,
he has no doubt,

00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:19.618
even though the data's not as
solid as one would like,

00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:23.348
he has no doubt that it was
infrequent sexual activity that

00:29:23.348 --> 00:29:27.997
led to the low birthrate,
as a cultural thing not as a

00:29:27.997 --> 00:29:31.759
conscious way of reducing
fertility.

00:29:31.759 --> 00:29:36.204
He describes a story where a
young couple gets married and

00:29:36.204 --> 00:29:39.806
they're in the--
what we perceive as the height

00:29:39.806 --> 00:29:42.795
of sexual desire and--
but their sleeping arrangements

00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:45.683
are they have--
there's a double-decker bed and

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:48.444
they're married--
the young married couple sleeps

00:29:48.444 --> 00:29:50.730
above and the grandmother is in
the bed below,

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.458
and the grandmother--carries
her cane to bed and whenever

00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:57.920
upstairs she hears things
starting to go on bang,

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.097
bang, bang, cut it out and so
that kind of thing that the old

00:30:03.097 --> 00:30:06.118
people didn't go along with
this.

00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:10.490
The reason for this,
as the Chinese would see it,

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.210
is that the Confucian ethic,
they don't have--

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.713
it's not a religious thing at
all, there's no sense of a deity

00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:19.838
or anything supernatural going
on,

00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:23.390
but personal relationships are
what's important.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.980
They are a set of unequal
personal relationship;

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.191
a subject has to give absolute
deference to the ruler,

00:30:31.191 --> 00:30:32.038
the emperor.
 

00:30:32.038 --> 00:30:35.691
Children have to give absolute
deference to the parents and to

00:30:35.691 --> 00:30:36.230
elders.
 

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.259
Women have to give absolute
deference first to her brothers

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:43.038
and then to her husband,
women to men.

00:30:43.038 --> 00:30:46.469
Younger brothers have to give
absolute deference to their

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:47.509
older brothers.
 

00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:51.844
Of these, the only relationship
that's equal is friend/friend

00:30:51.844 --> 00:30:54.326
relationship,
that's the fifth relationship,

00:30:54.326 --> 00:30:57.067
so you can be buddies with your
friend but you must be superior

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.958
to your wife,
and your wife must be inferior

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:02.278
to you,
and so you cannot be friends

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:02.940
with them.
 

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.104
Love or passion between a
married couple not only didn't

00:31:06.104 --> 00:31:07.839
happen,
it was not approved of,

00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:09.942
it was like being--
you're being bad if you love

00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:12.190
your wife,
if you have passion for your

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.288
wife, that was not a good thing.
 

00:31:14.288 --> 00:31:19.125
Husband and wife did not relate
to each other as lovers or even

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.140
as friends.
 

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.721
And there's a very famous
Chinese story where a young man

00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:29.439
had been married some years,
is walking with a friend--with

00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:33.868
another male friend with whom he
can befriend and converse and

00:31:33.868 --> 00:31:36.630
he's bemoaning his fate that
here,

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.558
he loves his wife so extremely
but he can't have a--

00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:43.170
he can't express his love for
her to her,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.741
he can't have walks in the
moonlight like he's having with

00:31:45.741 --> 00:31:48.528
his male friend,
he can't have this kind of a

00:31:48.528 --> 00:31:52.659
chat with her because that is
against the morality and ethics

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:53.829
of the system.
 

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.703
These cultural things,
which I think no Chinese of the

00:32:01.703 --> 00:32:06.227
time would describe as 'that's
the way we keep our population

00:32:06.227 --> 00:32:09.769
down,' is what's the explanation
for this,

00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:16.400
rather than some kind of
conscious effort.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.354
Another factor that is not a
conscious sort of thing is the

00:32:20.354 --> 00:32:23.150
Chinese married younger then
Europeans.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.284
When you do an age adjusted
thing, by 20 they had been

00:32:26.284 --> 00:32:29.747
married for several years,
and there's what called the

00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:32.951
boredom factor going on,
that no matter what age couples

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.650
marry at they have sex a lot in
the beginning and so--

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.957
if they're not protecting
themselves they have a high

00:32:37.957 --> 00:32:39.509
birthrate and then it falls
down.

00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:43.473
Some fraction of this
difference here may just be due

00:32:43.473 --> 00:32:45.380
to the age of marriage.
 

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.355
Student:  So then why is
that Chinese population is so

00:32:48.355 --> 00:32:49.250
much more dense?
 

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.640
Prof: Yeah,
we're going to get to that.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.042
Actually we may not get to it
until next time but that's

00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:58.311
still,
again we're pushing--we still

00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:03.269
haven't explained why the
population is more dense--

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:07.304
it's getting time--let me just
finish saying something about

00:33:07.304 --> 00:33:10.450
this 10% to 25% getting rid of
the females,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.221
which again,
would reduce the population

00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:14.720
would lead you to not think
there was such a density.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.568
In the seventeenth century,
again this is from Jesuit

00:33:18.568 --> 00:33:22.140
missionaries to China,
reporting back to Europe,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.720
they were horrified to find
that in Beijing along,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.880
Peking at the time,
several thousand babies,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.750
almost exclusively females,
were thrown into the streets

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.114
like refuse to be collected each
morning by carriers who dumped

00:33:37.114 --> 00:33:40.000
them into huge pits outside the
city.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.230
It sounds very much like Europe
of the similar time.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.509
What's interesting is that,
right now,

00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:51.538
China is approaching pretty
much the same female,

00:33:51.538 --> 00:33:54.400
with the sex selective
infanticide,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.806
pretty the same female deficit
that's been as far as we can

00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:02.902
tell a traditional level of it,
but now there's all this

00:34:02.902 --> 00:34:06.807
moaning and groaning about all
these unmarried males and how it

00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:10.588
will utterly disrupt Chinese
society and it's a horrible sort

00:34:10.588 --> 00:34:11.469
of thing.
 

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.260
Also, I think I mentioned this
before,

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.510
as you've seen in Europe rather
than 10% to 25% of the males not

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.882
being able to get married
because of the deficit of

00:34:20.882 --> 00:34:23.490
females,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the males

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:25.280
did not get married in Europe.
 

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.369
I showed you the graphs of that
when we discussed Europe.

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:35.280
The Chinese system,
fertility system,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.989
which keeps their population
manageable,

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:44.760
not small but manageable,
is moderately early,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.394
not extremely early,
moderately early and nearly

00:34:47.394 --> 00:34:49.750
universal marriage of surviving
females.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.835
In 1998, for instance,
only 1% of Chinese women were

00:34:53.835 --> 00:34:57.904
unmarried by age 30,
whereas, in the west in that

00:34:57.904 --> 00:35:01.320
year 15% were unmarried 15 times
as much,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.650
even by age 40 in the west.
 

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.880
The European system was that
only about half of everybody got

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.306
married,
but once married they had

00:35:14.306 --> 00:35:20.228
births at about twice the rate
of Chinese and Chinese all the

00:35:20.228 --> 00:35:25.043
women got married,
but within marriage they had a

00:35:25.043 --> 00:35:27.070
low rate of fertility.
 

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.077
You have to--you cut your
fertility down by half either by

00:35:31.077 --> 00:35:35.154
the European thing of less than
complete marriage or by the

00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:38.670
Chinese thing of less than
complete fertility.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.425
It looks like that fertility,
the total fertility rates

00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:50.820
should be more or less the same
between China and Europe,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.250
but by essentially opposite
kinds of fertility systems.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.849
We'll see--I'm sorry next time
we'll continue and we'll see

00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:04.052
what is one of the theories for
why China got into the

00:36:04.052 --> 00:36:07.119
difficulties,
it was not just uncontrolled

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:07.940
reproduction.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.890
Prof: Anybody here
happen to be from Korea?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.910
Are you born there?
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.650
Student: Yes
Prof: Are you from Seoul?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.650
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.390
Prof: You may know about
this, okay.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:19.780
There's a--do you know about
the oldest tree in Seoul?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.210
Student: No.
 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.930
Prof: This is the oldest
tree in Seoul.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.395
It's a Gingko tree,
and it's supposed to be 840

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:32.915
years old, that's a really old
tree and it's venerated by the

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:33.970
residents.
 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.602
It's kind of a holy sacred tree
and they bring fruit,

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.885
they bring other offerings once
a year and pray,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:43.750
among other things,
for their safety.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.857
Its real advantage is that it
helps pregnant women to have a

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:53.100
boy child and so this is a very
important tree.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400
Do you know about this tree?
 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.280
Student:  No.
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.160
Prof: No.
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.514
Student:  But I've heard
about Gingko trees and how they

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:02.570
have to do with fertility and
stuff.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.962
Prof: Yes,
okay Ginkgo is one of the few

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:07.409
kinds of trees that have male
and female sex.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.049
Most trees are hermaphrodite,
have both male and female sex.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.094
Anyway, it turns out they ran
into a problem with this tree

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.351
because two apartment buildings
were interfering with the trees

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:19.400
roots as the tree spread its
roots.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.691
What happens--so the district
government spent $4.3 million

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.170
dollars to take down the
apartment buildings.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.352
So it just goes to show you the
importance and the political

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:34.402
acceptability,
the cultural acceptability of

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:35.750
son preference.
 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.599
It's a very,
very big factor in the world.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.878
The sex ratio,
is a very important biological

00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:47.200
factor, if we have time at the
end I'll tell you a good bit

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.170
about it.
 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.593
Just to show you that it's very
well controlled biologically,

00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:58.745
this is one of several theories
about how the sex ratio in

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.730
humans gets to be what it is.
 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.670
The sperms are 50/50.
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.235
There's 100 male sperms to 100
female sperms and that's because

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:14.532
the sex is determined by the
father and the father has one X

00:02:14.532 --> 00:02:17.771
and one Y,
and when they split to go into

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.483
separate sperms one gets an X,
one gets a Y,

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:21.430
that's even.
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.186
By the second month of
gestation, so this is still in

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:27.857
the mother's womb,
apparently a huge fraction of

00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:32.090
about one-third of the male
fetuses have died,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.008
leaving--I'm sorry the female
fetuses have died because now

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.990
it's a high male ratio.
 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.971
Then as time goes on the male
fetuses start to die and when

00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:52.467
you end up, you get 106 at birth
all over the world unless people

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.530
are messing with it.
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.628
There's about 106 male births
to every 100 female births.

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:03.341
This is a very,
very fixed number,

00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:06.955
so for instance,
in the United States in 1969

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:10.900
there were 105.3 males born per
100 females;

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.860
1995 30 something years later
104.9, so difference of .4.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.306
That number really does not
vary except basically between

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:25.669
105 and 106.
 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.979
It's a very, very stable number.
 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:37.098
Given that, you can look at
some parts of the world and see

00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:39.038
something like this.
 

00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:44.490
This is again the sex ratio and
you can look over time,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.681
1972 to 1992 a 20 year span and
here is Japan where they started

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:55.223
a little bit of X--
here's the numbers you should

00:03:55.223 --> 00:03:57.348
expect,
somewhere in this range.

00:03:57.348 --> 00:04:02.217
They have somewhat of an excess
of boys but very minor and than

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:07.241
during this period of time Japan
came down to almost exactly that

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.419
106 number.
 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.258
Look at what's going on in
China, up to 113 or so,

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:19.086
which means basically seven out
of every 100 girls are being

00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:21.259
done away with 7%.
 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.449
That's not anywhere near the
worst case.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.629
What do you think is the cause
of this?

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.589
Student:  Mitochondrial
DNA.

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:34.779
Prof: Mitochondrial DNA?
 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.449
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.160
mitochondrial DNA can choose to
eliminate male fetuses.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.750
Prof: So you think it's
a very long term evolutionary--

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.300
what she's saying is she
thinks--there's stuff that--

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.230
the Y--the sperm--the Y
chromosome has very few genes,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.889
the X chromosome has many genes.
 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.785
There looks like there's a long
evolutionary process by which

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:06.129
genes are getting eliminated on
the Y,

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.517
and eventually the Y will then
have nothing on it and

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:09.069
disappear.
 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.314
This is much too short a time,
we're talking ten years,

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:15.738
evolution just doesn't happen
in ten years but it's a good

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:16.459
thought.
 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:18.365
Student:  Does it have
something to do with the

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:19.839
implementation of the one child
policy;

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:24.730
people wanting sons as opposed
to daughters.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.800
Prof: Very good.
 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.889
This is the most usual answer:
the one child policy in China.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.464
This is China remember and the
one child policy,

00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:36.750
so people have heard of the one
child policy and I'm going to

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.120
give a lecture on it.
 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.769
Does that sound like a good
hypothesis to you?

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.000
But just saying it doesn't make
it true, so what else did--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.360
Student:  This is at
birth.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.519
Prof: This is at birth.
 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.567
Student:  How could
you--even if you wanted sons I

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:53.670
presume that the greatest way to
manage that would through

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.720
infanticide and you can't do
that until after birth.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.290
Prof: Very good idea.
 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.180
What she says is look this is
at birth.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.278
Students:
 &gt;

00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:09.189
Prof: Good,
I'm glad all this discussion.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.139
Let's notice one other thing.
 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.377
One child policy,
when does the one child policy

00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:14.930
start?
 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.769
We'll come back to these
explanations;

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.290
they're all good.
 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.279
Anybody know?
 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.350
Guess what, about 1979,1980.
 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.709
When does this take off?
 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:33.492
That looks like now we've got
at least a second piece of

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:39.591
evidence that it's--the time
sequence fits very nicely with

00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.220
the one child policy.
 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.790
How can we check that?
 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.315
We're still--we have to be very
skeptical about everything that

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:49.129
anyone tells you;
that's the scientific attitude.

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.310
Anything anybody tells you,
politics,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.564
science, religion,
economics, try to sell you

00:06:53.564 --> 00:06:55.916
something,
immediate gut response is

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.209
'that's nonsense prove it to
me.'

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.509
I'm not convinced yet so what
else might you do?

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.420
Student:  If you can
find data on abortions.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.574
Prof: You could find
data on abortions,

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:06.910
good.
 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.240
We'll look at that when we talk
about China.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.790
We might look at other
countries that don't have the

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.740
one child policy.
 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.569
Here's another country,
this is India,

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:23.468
and you have--remember the
Chinese--and this is a somewhat

00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:25.850
different data set.
 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.473
This is not at birth but the
total population which is less

00:07:30.473 --> 00:07:32.468
extreme,
but a comparable number for

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.449
China would be here,
so India is more extreme than

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:35.949
China.
 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.303
Student:  India is a bad
example because bride prices are

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:41.699
so high that they
&gt;

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.702
Prof: There are reasons,
other reasons in India,

00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:46.632
there's clearly reasons all
around and they may be different

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.709
in different places but the main
hypothesis that we are working

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.680
on it and come back to it,
it's very important.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.177
The main hypothesis that we're
working on is that it's one

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:57.649
child policy in China.
 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:01.535
Now we see that China is not
particularly extreme say

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:03.028
compared to India.
 

00:08:03.028 --> 00:08:05.341
It depends on what year you
look and exactly what statistic

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:05.899
you look at.
 

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:08.269
It's really in the same
ballpark with India.

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:11.706
Now we have to say that well,
it's probably not one child

00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:12.259
policy.
 

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:16.000
What's our next hypothesis?
 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.339
We've heard a different one for
China.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:22.774
India has bride price but than
if you start with India and say

00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:25.610
that, China doesn't have bride
price;

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.088
they have dowry,
they may have in fact the

00:08:30.088 --> 00:08:31.290
opposite.
 

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.567
What about--
Student:  Is it sex

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:34.450
selective abortion?
 

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.428
Prof: That's something,
but why are the women doing it?

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.567
Poverty, that's the usual thing
when you speak of India and

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:40.000
China.
 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.303
In these years they were still
very--they're still quite poor

00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:47.158
but it was poverty.
 

00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:54.048
How does that strike you as a
hypothesis for this?

00:08:54.048 --> 00:08:57.750
Or part of it,
these things are multi-causal.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.274
Student:  China's
economy has been taking off but

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:02.019
it's the--ratios are still going
up.

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:04.520
Prof: Well the only--
I'm going to show you that data

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.428
but I only showed you the data
up to 1990,

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:12.750
1992 so I haven't--I'm going to
show you that.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.466
Again we can go to an
international comparison if we

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:19.745
want to see if poverty is at the
root of this,

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.370
and what are we looking at
here?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.200
Korea, South Korea.
 

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.456
Korea is not a poor country and
yet they're just as bad,

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:35.190
in fact a little bit more
extreme than China at this time.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.163
We really have quite a
conundrum that we can give

00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:44.461
particular explanations for each
place but they're maybe going to

00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.870
be different.
 

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.981
Student:  Is it maybe
just population growth in

00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:49.570
general?
 

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.413
Prof: It could be
population growth in general,

00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:55.308
that's certainly true of all of
the three countries.

00:09:55.308 --> 00:09:57.950
That there's something about
the density of population;

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.461
hard to prove since India and
China have been very crowded for

00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:06.307
a very long time and Korea is
also crowded but not as

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:08.750
extremely as China and India.
 

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.558
Not--the greatest sex ratio is
in South Korea,

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:25.907
which is, as you heard,
is not poor and by 2010 there

00:10:25.907 --> 00:10:29.668
will be a 20% deficit in the
marriage age,

00:10:29.668 --> 00:10:34.666
there will be a 20% deficit of
females in Korea which is quite

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:37.370
high and that's done away with.
 

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.495
The poverty thing,
the economic thing does not

00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.996
work between countries,
and even if you look,

00:10:44.996 --> 00:10:46.860
I'll show you a little bit
later,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.153
there's big regional variations
within each country but it

00:10:51.153 --> 00:10:53.788
doesn't go with economics at
all.

00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:58.265
In China, in Guangdong,
where everything you're wearing

00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:03.250
and everything you play with,
including probably this is made

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.408
somewhere in Guangdong Province
probably.

00:11:06.408 --> 00:11:11.140
It's one of the richer places
in China and the sex ratio there

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.568
is 130 to 100,
something I've showed you 12 to

00:11:14.568 --> 00:11:16.748
14,
in that province it goes up to

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:20.254
130 and parts of that province--
so of course even within a

00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:22.308
province there's different
places,

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:26.778
they can go up to 144 to 100,
so something like a third of

00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:29.210
the girls are done away with.
 

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.160
Student:  Provinces with
such a skewed sex ratio,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.184
do they end up paying dowry or
these bride prices because

00:11:37.184 --> 00:11:38.908
females are so rare?
 

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:42.028
Prof: No bride price
doesn't happen in either China

00:11:42.028 --> 00:11:43.264
or India;
bride price,

00:11:43.264 --> 00:11:45.541
you remember,
is when the man's family gives

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.029
something to the girl or the
girl's family,

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:54.562
dowry is the opposite and dowry
is common in India and really it

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:57.466
was--
communists got rid of it,

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:02.080
any vestige of that in China so
that's not the case.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.004
In India the same thing,
the states in New Delhi and

00:12:07.004 --> 00:12:11.061
Haryana, which are the richer
places there,

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:15.889
have more extreme sex ratios
then poor places.

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:24.748
There's--in Delhi there's 861
females per 1,000 males at birth

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:32.445
and so as time goes on,
as you see, the sex ratios are

00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:35.058
getting worse.
 

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:40.390
The answer to our problem of
what is causing--what caused

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.913
things to change at this point
in time is what someone here

00:12:45.913 --> 00:12:46.769
said.
 

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.750
What did someone say,
something that would have--

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.583
it wasn't the--is the one child
policy happened at this time but

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:55.080
something else happened in both
India,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.058
and China, and Korea.
 

00:12:58.058 --> 00:13:01.720
Student:  Did it have to
do with technology in terms of--

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.860
Prof: It has to do with
technology.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.918
Student:  for sex
selection prior to birth.

00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:10.538
Prof: For knowing the
sex before birth and what--

00:13:10.538 --> 00:13:11.788
Student: 
&gt;

00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:13.669
Prof: What is the
technology that's commonly used?

00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:14.668
Student:  Ultrasound.
 

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:18.447
Prof: Ultrasound,
that at that time ultrasound

00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:22.370
came in and became rather
inexpensive and available.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.620
The two ways of doing it are
amniocentesis,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.278
which is somewhat difficult
medically and quite expensive,

00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:30.110
but ultrasound you don't need
an awful lot of training,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.798
the equipment is not terribly
expensive.

00:13:32.798 --> 00:13:38.705
It costs I think about $14 in
India, in this period of time,

00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:43.808
to get an ultrasound test of
what your fetus was.

00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:49.490
In one of the counties in
China, for instance,

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.610
they started doing ultrasound,
and what happened was the first

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.866
child,
and I'll show you some data,

00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:57.750
that was okay if it was a girl.
 

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.195
But, if the second--if they had
a first girl and the second

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:06.179
child was also a girl,
then 92% of the time the girls

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.788
would be aborted.
 

00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:12.881
I think in your reading it
talks about in India--they

00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:18.756
looked at 8,000 serial abortions
in a particular hospital and

00:14:18.756 --> 00:14:21.009
7,999 were females.
 

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:24.807
One was a male and that was
probably a mistake they just

00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:29.089
read--didn't read the ultrasound
right, it's not always easy to

00:14:29.089 --> 00:14:29.778
do it.
 

00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:33.759
What's happening is that,
in India and in China it's

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:37.460
illegal in both places,
but they have even sidewalk

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.048
clinics that you can just go and
get a little ultrasound.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:45.158
How many of you have had some
sort of ultrasound?

00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:49.046
Yeah it's very--they take a
little probe about that long and

00:14:49.046 --> 00:14:53.063
this and just run it over you
and get a picture on a TV screen

00:14:53.063 --> 00:14:55.384
and you know,
whatever, your heart,

00:14:55.384 --> 00:14:57.724
or your lungs,
or your baby,

00:14:57.724 --> 00:15:00.220
whatever is going on.
 

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:08.580
That's what's going on,
it's the cheap ultrasound.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.840
Doctors in a lot of
places--doctors--

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.730
it's so fast to do this,
it's so cheap,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.369
it doesn't take much skill,
that in a lot of places doctors

00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:19.236
are just giving up all the rest
of their practice and just doing

00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:19.918
ultrasound.
 

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:22.990
It's sort of like liposuction
here or something.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.524
It's easy and cheap and they
make a lot of women--a lot of

00:15:29.524 --> 00:15:31.590
money with this.
 

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.160
The head of the Women's
Association in India says,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.553
"No one wants girls;
if the test says a girl then

00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:43.710
the pregnant woman will have an
abortion."

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.750
Someone else also mentioned
this I think,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:53.178
that the final sex ratio not at
birth as we said,

00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:56.841
the hint as one of you picked
out, the fact that this is at

00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:59.620
birth means it's not an
infanticide issue.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.889
This is something done before
birth,

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:04.923
the only thing you can do
before birth is sex selective

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:08.294
abortion so it's clearly the
mechanism of this and the timing

00:16:08.294 --> 00:16:10.879
is clearly the introduction of
ultrasound.

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:15.256
The total sex ratio of the
countries hasn't changed all

00:16:15.256 --> 00:16:16.230
that much.
 

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:21.006
Then, in China we have pretty
good data and traditionally

00:16:21.006 --> 00:16:26.041
where-ever one has data there
has been a dearth of about 10%

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:30.817
to 25% of girls from--
they have data back to the

00:16:30.817 --> 00:16:33.668
1700s, that's pretty decent.
 

00:16:33.668 --> 00:16:39.046
Back then it was infanticide so
what you're really seeing is a

00:16:39.046 --> 00:16:43.365
change of method that the
society is going from an

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:48.653
infanticide control of the sex
ratio to an ultrasound and sex

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:53.058
selective abortion control of
the sex ratio.

00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:57.697
Apparently the desire and the
cultural desire for males hasn't

00:16:57.697 --> 00:17:02.365
changed all that much,
but technology has changed what

00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:05.578
they do and to most people's
mind--

00:17:05.578 --> 00:17:11.983
an abortion is a better thing
than an infanticide but you can

00:17:11.983 --> 00:17:15.720
make up your own mind about
that.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:22.028
Let me give you some more data
on the various questions that

00:17:22.028 --> 00:17:24.058
you've all asked.
 

00:17:24.058 --> 00:17:28.108
One is an update in time so
that particular slide stopped

00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:32.519
in--in that particular data set
stopped in 1992 and this picks

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.400
up a little bit later.
 

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.663
Here is again India,
five states there,

00:17:36.663 --> 00:17:40.355
and in the most extreme states,
which again are the richest not

00:17:40.355 --> 00:17:41.308
the poorest.
 

00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:44.578
This is of course--these are
rich states, this is southern

00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:47.962
states, there are all these
different reasons and we'll come

00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:49.338
to that in a moment.
 

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:56.998
Here we saw ratios of 114 or so
and now they've gone up to 129

00:17:56.998 --> 00:18:03.711
and slowly getting better,
a little bit better with time

00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:07.630
out to the last census in 2006
data.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:13.955
These are two well off
provinces and they are in

00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:19.460
extreme southern India is--
in North India they speak

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.019
Hindi--mostly Hindi related
languages,

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:25.769
in the south Dravidian related
languages.

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:28.705
The Muslim invasions didn't
quite reach the south of India,

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:31.390
a lot of differences between
north and south India.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.221
In terms of demography or a
culture, almost anything,

00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:36.019
it's crazy to talk about India.
 

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:38.720
You cannot talk about India;
it's so diverse.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.326
China, they've convinced the
people that they're one culture,

00:18:42.326 --> 00:18:44.430
but in India that's not the
case.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.866
So you really have to compare
this as a kind of--these two

00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:53.460
states as one kind of country
and they are very close to the

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.548
106 level.
 

00:18:54.548 --> 00:18:58.118
This is--and also,
just weirdly in most places,

00:18:58.118 --> 00:19:01.651
it's the number of boys to
girls, but in India the way they

00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:05.670
define sex ratio is the opposite
so I've translated into these--

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.791
these are the numbers that are
comparable to what you've been

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:10.480
hearing.
 

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.568
That's India.
 

00:19:14.568 --> 00:19:17.659
Here is China,
and again it has gone more

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:22.140
extreme, so we stopped here
about 1992 in the 112 range.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.617
This is at birth,
age zero, so we're looking at

00:19:28.617 --> 00:19:34.897
this line that's here,
and that has now gone up to 118

00:19:34.897 --> 00:19:37.017
or 119,
the sex ratio at birth,

00:19:37.017 --> 00:19:39.078
and then as the child grows
older,

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:42.240
as the set of children that
you're counting grows older,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:49.480
the sex ratio gets more and
more skewed as time goes on and

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.099
we'll look at that in a little
bit.

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:56.170
It is very diverse.
 

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.950
I mentioned this,
very diverse by province,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.943
here again is India,
so Kerala as I mentioned to

00:20:01.943 --> 00:20:03.842
you,
they're very poor,

00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:06.990
Kerala is a very poor state in
India,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.602
one of the poorest,
but they had a communist

00:20:09.602 --> 00:20:12.700
government for a long time and
very matriarchal,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.818
their traditional system
was--not matriarchal,

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:19.190
matrilineal so women have more
power.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.200
For a lot of reasons Kerala has
been doing very well on social--

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.848
indicators of social progress
and look at it's--

00:20:26.848 --> 00:20:33.428
this is child mortality from
zero to five through the first

00:20:33.428 --> 00:20:35.470
five years here.
 

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:45.140
Males 6 per 1,000 male death;
4.5 females, very low deaths;

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:51.301
compare that to Bihar ,
a very poor state where 50 or

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:54.740
60, up to 70 almost deaths.
 

00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:01.960
It's a factor of 10 or 15 for
females, the difference between

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:08.700
different states in India and
the same thing in China.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:18.525
Here is--what I wanted to show
you about that slide was--well

00:21:18.525 --> 00:21:22.618
forget it for a minute.
 

00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:25.509
This is China and you have
again very different--

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:29.586
this is sex ratio at birth,
SRB, sex ratio at birth and

00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:32.528
over different periods of time
1982,

00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:37.717
1990 and so forth--notice in
between the green which is a

00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:40.502
normal ratio,
even bias toward females,

00:21:40.502 --> 00:21:42.588
this is almost within the
normal range.

00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:46.960
This would be bias toward
females and Tibet,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.791
the far western provinces are
even normal or even bias toward

00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:56.462
females and that is a cultural
difference because these are

00:21:56.462 --> 00:22:00.650
Muslim provinces and the Koran
forbids the killing of

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.519
daughters,
so Muslim countries in general

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:08.019
do not have these very skewed
sex ratios.

00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:11.588
Tibet of course is Buddhist and
they also don't do this,

00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:15.818
but in the Han regions,
the heartland of China,

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:21.644
especially around 2000,2005 a
very high ratio 120 to 138 and

00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:27.584
is changing a little bit slowly,
so as time goes on you see they

00:22:27.584 --> 00:22:30.710
go from the 112 that we talked
about,

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.644
the blue regions they are
being--disappearing and you're

00:22:34.644 --> 00:22:38.150
getting a more extreme situation
here in China.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:44.076
Again you can pick out;
depending on if you look at

00:22:44.076 --> 00:22:50.941
more culturally homogenous
regions, you get either very low

00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:54.730
numbers or very high numbers.
 

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.865
Now here's another thing which
I mentioned, it depends terribly

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:01.868
much on parity,
how many children they already

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:02.470
have.
 

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.346
For a first birth,
this is China,

00:23:05.346 --> 00:23:09.838
and going out to the year 2000
and this is the--

00:23:09.838 --> 00:23:17.673
this is parity here and this is
the different censuses so the

00:23:17.673 --> 00:23:25.377
latest census 2005 I think is
this census here and for first

00:23:25.377 --> 00:23:29.701
birth it's 107--
it's pretty normal,

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:35.015
a little bit elevated but by
second birth it goes enormously

00:23:35.015 --> 00:23:39.880
up and you're into like 140 or a
prior census 150,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.740
so a 50% difference in boys and
girls,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.314
and that extreme there is the
one child policy is pushing that

00:23:46.314 --> 00:23:50.440
because they're only allowed--
we'll talk a lot about that.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.752
This is not really true anymore
but in principle they're allowed

00:23:53.752 --> 00:23:56.807
only one child,
so you get these very high

00:23:56.807 --> 00:24:00.130
ratios here and then by three
children,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:06.308
four or five children,
the sex ratio is enormous.

00:24:06.308 --> 00:24:09.390
You may sort of have a little
thing in your mind,

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.592
wait a minute one child policy,
and here they're having one

00:24:12.592 --> 00:24:13.766
child,
they're have two children,

00:24:13.766 --> 00:24:15.769
they're having three children,
they're having four children,

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:20.077
they're having five children,
what's going on and we're going

00:24:20.077 --> 00:24:22.048
to talk about that.
 

00:24:22.048 --> 00:24:26.759
Here is--and again you don't
want to nail this too hard to

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:31.468
the one child policy because
here is South Korea and again

00:24:31.468 --> 00:24:35.930
this is all old-time but look
what it goes up to,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.980
the same thing.
 

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.644
You look at the most recent
numbers on this graph and for

00:24:40.644 --> 00:24:43.328
first birth it's quite a normal
ratio,

00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:46.638
second birth it gets bigger,
by third birth it's bigger than

00:24:46.638 --> 00:24:50.103
anything we see in China,
and by fourth birth its way,

00:24:50.103 --> 00:24:51.318
way up, over 237.
 

00:24:51.318 --> 00:24:56.460
We saw about 160 or something
in China on the previous slide.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.829
Again, Korea,
no one child policy,

00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:06.259
no government control of
fertility at all,

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:12.220
and yet they are more extreme
than China.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:20.796
At birth, the genetic
factor--boys have an X and a Y

00:25:20.796 --> 00:25:26.848
chromosome, and girls have two
Xs.

00:25:26.848 --> 00:25:29.867
Humans, as well as every other
animal, carry a lot of

00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:33.175
deleterious or even lethal
mutations, but you have them on

00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:34.568
only one chromosome.
 

00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:38.000
The other chromosome will
have--in general will have a

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.818
normal copy of the gene and for
almost every gene one normal

00:25:41.818 --> 00:25:45.118
chromosome makes enough of the
proper protein,

00:25:45.118 --> 00:25:46.409
and you're alive,
you're fine,

00:25:46.409 --> 00:25:48.765
you don't even notice that
you've got this deleterious

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:49.608
mutation there.
 

00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:52.678
It's only when you get a
mutation from both parents that

00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:54.460
it becomes--
it's homozygous,

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.210
you're getting the deleterious
mutation with both parents,

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.490
than the person is sick.
 

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.218
That works for all the
chromosomes except for the sex

00:26:04.218 --> 00:26:05.150
chromosome.
 

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.990
A female has two Xs so this
still holds for her.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:12.057
She's got to be really unlucky
and get bad copies from both

00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:13.460
mother and father.
 

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.432
A male has one X and the Y with
almost nothing on it,

00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:20.029
so if he gets a bad X he's
sick;

00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:22.670
so males are weaker.
 

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.133
One of the thoughts about why
106 males are born for every 100

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:31.741
females is that as time goes on
those males die during childhood

00:26:31.741 --> 00:26:35.986
because they are genetically
weaker and eventually it evens

00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:37.230
out to 100.
 

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.392
There's good evolutionary
reasons why evolution pushes a

00:26:41.392 --> 00:26:46.160
sexually reproducing species to
100 males and 100 females and we

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.808
can go into that later perhaps.
 

00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:52.404
You're seeing that--this is at
birth, right around birth which

00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:55.529
is still genetic reasons,
and this is all of India.

00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:59.150
You see that now the male
deaths are higher than the

00:26:59.150 --> 00:26:59.858
females.
 

00:26:59.858 --> 00:27:04.578
This is a sign of the genetic
weakness of males at birth.

00:27:04.578 --> 00:27:10.358
When you break that down by
state, every single state 54:40,

00:27:10.358 --> 00:27:15.818
there's more male deaths 71:68,
so what do we have--

00:27:15.818 --> 00:27:22.092
one of the Punjab which had a
high pro-male ratio but at birth

00:27:22.092 --> 00:27:26.720
there's more male death than
female death,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.079
so that's a biological
phenomenon;

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:31.329
that continues.
 

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:45.700
If you look later to child
mortality,

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.240
now we're done with the birth
mortality,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.338
we're done with sex selective
abortion,

00:27:51.338 --> 00:27:55.695
that the sex selective abortion
itself changes the sex ratio but

00:27:55.695 --> 00:27:57.327
then,
even after that,

00:27:57.327 --> 00:27:59.348
the sex ratio keeps changing.
 

00:27:59.348 --> 00:28:03.643
Here again is in the first five
years after birth and notice

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:08.009
again in Kerala where they don't
have this sex selective--

00:28:08.009 --> 00:28:09.829
this sex choice and I showed
you this,

00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:12.400
more males die than females.
 

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.048
That's again the normal
biological issue,

00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:17.980
but in every other state,
females are--

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.960
this is two and a half times as
much,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.338
this is four times as much
female mortality,

00:28:25.338 --> 00:28:28.358
one and a half times as much,
more than twice as much,

00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:32.130
twice as much,
half again as much.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.987
Then, in all the states of
India, with the exception of

00:28:35.987 --> 00:28:40.058
Kerala, there's an excess female
mortality after birth.

00:28:40.058 --> 00:28:43.124
That's counter-biological,
and what that is,

00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:47.400
is basically some infanticide,
but largely female neglect.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.900
They get less food,
they get less good food,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.193
they get sick,
they get taken to the doctor

00:28:52.193 --> 00:28:54.548
less often,
if medicines are required they

00:28:54.548 --> 00:28:55.818
don't get it very well.
 

00:28:55.818 --> 00:29:03.009
So you see this after birth
reduction in females also.

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:12.160
The problem just keeps
happening.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:18.580
This issue of the loss of
females in a population is a

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.490
very large phenomenon.
 

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.452
Statistics--well from this data
you can make fairly decent

00:29:24.452 --> 00:29:27.000
statistics for places where this
is collected,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.596
so in India alone,
there's supposed to be

00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:32.390
something like 23 million women
missing,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.980
so add all this up and you get
23 million.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.830
In the world the--somewhere
between an estimate and a

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.670
guesstimate is 100 million
missing women.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.900
You could say when you look
deeper,

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.234
more deeply,
we have the sort of the

00:29:50.234 --> 00:29:53.609
proximate cause,
people are using sex selective

00:29:53.609 --> 00:29:58.999
abortion but we haven't touched
much on the question of why do

00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:01.118
they want to do that.
 

00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:03.078
You can just say it's
traditional.

00:30:03.078 --> 00:30:06.068
And I hear a lot of discussions
that say that and this is true.

00:30:06.068 --> 00:30:10.279
In India's first national
census, which is 1871,

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:15.386
there were 98 million males but
only 91.5 million females,

00:30:15.386 --> 00:30:19.240
already 6% of the females were
missing.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.862
Whereas, in a population which
doesn't discriminate against

00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:24.164
females,
males being weaker all during

00:30:24.164 --> 00:30:26.683
the ages,
there get to be more and more

00:30:26.683 --> 00:30:30.480
females and with the older ages
extreme excess of females,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.730
but in India already in 1871
there was quite a difference.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.672
In China--this is a Chinese
book of travels from the

00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:43.846
nineteenth century and someone--
a Chinese person went to

00:30:43.846 --> 00:30:47.394
India--went to England and
observed things and came back

00:30:47.394 --> 00:30:51.455
and wrote a travel book for the
Chinese and this is a quote from

00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:55.453
that: "England is so short
of inhabitants that the English

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:57.838
rear every child that is born.
 

00:30:57.838 --> 00:31:01.255
Even prostitutes who bear
children do not destroy

00:31:01.255 --> 00:31:02.180
them."
 

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.069
England was the dominant power
of the world and they were

00:31:06.069 --> 00:31:08.710
invading China with the Opium
Wars,

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.964
so of course everybody
including the Emperor was

00:31:10.964 --> 00:31:12.788
interested in what is England
like,

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.230
how come they're so powerful,
what's different there,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.028
and so the Emperor read this
and the Emperor's response was,

00:31:20.028 --> 00:31:23.980
he didn't believe that the
English were so stupid.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.519
Again, the cultural thing that
to raise up all the children,

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:33.288
and especially to raise up all
the girls, is just not going.

00:31:33.288 --> 00:31:37.549
In your reading packet,
it discusses villages in India

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:41.410
dating back to 1830 that have no
girls at all.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.848
They just do away with all the
girls, all of them are killed.

00:31:45.848 --> 00:31:50.880
1921, Somerset Maugham,
does that name ring any bells?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.803
He was a famous author,
wrote a lot of novels,

00:31:53.803 --> 00:31:56.661
a lot of movies with very
famous movie stars,

00:31:56.661 --> 00:31:58.348
a very popular author.
 

00:31:58.348 --> 00:32:02.279
In 1921 he was touring China
and he came upon a little tower

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:06.410
on a Chinese hillside with a
single small hole in the wall,

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.898
so they're walking along and
there's a small tower with a

00:32:09.898 --> 00:32:11.519
little hole in the wall.
 

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:16.710
Out of that hole came a
nauseating odor and he asked--

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.880
he was with a Chinese guide and
he asked him what is that,

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.348
and he thought maybe feces were
dumped there or something.

00:32:23.348 --> 00:32:27.571
No, it turns out it was a baby
tower and it was just a pit dug

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:31.448
into the ground and surrounded
with this tower and people

00:32:31.448 --> 00:32:36.388
brought excess girls especially,
but some occasionally boys and

00:32:36.388 --> 00:32:38.608
just dumped them into this.
 

00:32:38.608 --> 00:32:41.780
A little boy came up and
explained this to him and said

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.365
that--the little boy said that
four babies were thrown in that

00:32:45.365 --> 00:32:46.068
morning.
 

00:32:46.068 --> 00:32:49.335
This doesn't--this particular
passage didn't discuss the sex

00:32:49.335 --> 00:32:52.655
of the babies because he didn't
know that, they're already in

00:32:52.655 --> 00:32:53.210
there.
 

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.733
One of the quotes is,
"The female child is

00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:59.108
regarded as a liability here.
 

00:32:59.108 --> 00:33:02.618
In rural areas women are not
even considered people."

00:33:02.618 --> 00:33:07.005
You'll do some reading where,
rather biased reading but

00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:10.627
accurate on this,
that girls often don't get

00:33:10.627 --> 00:33:14.384
names traditionally,
their named 'daughter number

00:33:14.384 --> 00:33:18.807
one,' 'daughter number two,'
'daughter number three,' and all

00:33:18.807 --> 00:33:20.210
kinds of things.
 

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.895
As I've mentioned the
elimination of females is not

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:27.730
limited to the young and in one
of your readings--

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:32.333
I guess I described it to you,
a tribe in New Guinea where if

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:36.170
a male died his widow was
immediately strangled.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.609
Do you remember that?
 

00:33:37.609 --> 00:33:40.910
That changes the sex ratio.
 

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.532
In India, you've all heard
about this, they're used to be a

00:33:44.532 --> 00:33:46.970
variant to this practice called
sati.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:50.782
You heard of sati or sutee,
sometime where the wife throws

00:33:50.782 --> 00:33:54.663
herself on the funeral pyre of
the man or in some other way

00:33:54.663 --> 00:33:56.470
does away with herself.
 

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.288
This is from 1813,
quite some time back,

00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:03.950
and there was a British captain
named Kemp who was eyewitness to

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:08.018
one of these things and he wrote
a description of it.

00:34:08.018 --> 00:34:10.639
" A male had been sick a
short time.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.592
An astrologer said that he was
on the point of death and so he

00:34:14.592 --> 00:34:18.739
was taken down to the side of
the holy Ganges River to expire.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.083
He was immersed to his waist in
the river for some time,

00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:23.300
but he didn't die.
 

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.619
They brought him back to the
bank of the river and let him

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:29.989
broil in the sun;
he didn't die.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.710
Then they put him back in the
river again, and he didn't die.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.518
He was returned to the
bank."

00:34:34.518 --> 00:34:38.534
This kept going for 36 hours
alternating sort of freezing and

00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:41.210
baking and finally this sick guy
died.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.809
Whether he would,
or would not,

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:44.409
have died anyway,
who knows.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:48.030
It was the astrologer's word
that he was going to die.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:52.016
His wife, he was married,
was a healthy young girl of

00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:52.860
about 16.
 

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.809
Learning of her husband's death
she decided to be buried alive

00:34:57.809 --> 00:34:59.268
with his corpse.
 

00:34:59.268 --> 00:35:01.875
The British officer,
this Kemp, tried in vain to

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:05.833
persuade the girl not to do it,
then tried to persuade the

00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:10.378
mother, and he said that a
resolution of this type to just

00:35:10.378 --> 00:35:13.489
kill yourself was a kind of
madness.

00:35:13.489 --> 00:35:16.637
He had no success and he
encountered not the slightest

00:35:16.637 --> 00:35:19.961
sign of either hesitation or a
great regret on either the

00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:22.159
girl's part or the mother's
part.

00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:27.202
The actual scene takes place;
the young widow accompanied by

00:35:27.202 --> 00:35:30.820
her friends proceeded to the
beach where his body lay.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.101
He was placed in a grave about
six feet deep,

00:35:34.101 --> 00:35:37.829
the wife circled the grave
seven times calling out,

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:40.440
"Hail God,
Hail God."

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.420
the surrounding crowd echoed
her chant, 'Hail God,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.150
Hail God.'
 

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.329
She climbed into the grave,
the captain,

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:50.657
this British guy moved up to
within a foot of the grave to

00:35:50.657 --> 00:35:54.101
see if at the last minute she
showed any signs of reluctance

00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:57.369
or whether her relatives showed
any sign of horror,

00:35:57.369 --> 00:36:00.358
and if she showed reluctance he
might have jumped in and pulled

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:00.840
her out.
 

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.449
She placed herself in a sitting
posture,

00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:06.137
as her husband had been placed,
didn't lay him flat but a

00:36:06.137 --> 00:36:08.300
sitting posture,
both faced north,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.949
so she was sitting behind his
back.

00:36:10.949 --> 00:36:14.902
She embraced the corpse with
her left hand and reclined her

00:36:14.902 --> 00:36:16.469
head on his shoulder.
 

00:36:16.469 --> 00:36:20.260
The British officer still saw
no sign of regret on her part.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.871
The other plan--the other hand
she placed over her head with

00:36:23.871 --> 00:36:27.730
her forefinger erect which she
moved in a circular direction.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:33.773
The watchers then started
throwing earth on them to start

00:36:33.773 --> 00:36:39.293
burying them and then other men,
as the earth was put in,

00:36:39.293 --> 00:36:43.505
they stamped on the earth to
pack it down but she continued

00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:48.007
circling her hand until her head
was completely buried and then

00:36:48.007 --> 00:36:52.730
she kept going for some time
after that and finally stopped.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.990
The earth was piled on and
stamped down and was two or

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.760
three feet above the heads of
the entombed.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.710
No tear was shed by any of the
relations.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:05.583
Eventually the crowd disbursed
and the ritual lamentations and

00:37:05.583 --> 00:37:08.059
howling commenced but without
sorrow.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:14.112
This is a long time ago and
it's certainly extremely rare

00:37:14.112 --> 00:37:17.139
now, if it happens at all.
 

00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:20.704
There was one report of one
woman in a village about ten

00:37:20.704 --> 00:37:23.967
years ago who did it,
and this is illegal in India,

00:37:23.967 --> 00:37:26.559
so very hard to get any decent
statistics,

00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:30.592
but very rarely it happens and
this woman who killed herself on

00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:33.974
her husband's pyre was
considered a paragon of virtue

00:37:33.974 --> 00:37:37.681
and sort of like a saint because
she was following the old

00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:40.998
religious customs and the
village was happy about it

00:37:40.998 --> 00:37:44.706
because they got a lot of
tourists to come and revere this

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:49.130
saint like lady and made a lot
of money off the tourists,

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:54.460
but it's very rare.
 

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.568
Of course this whole sex
preference business is not in

00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:00.739
any sense limited to Asia.
 

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:04.061
Hispanic women in Los Angeles
were surveyed,

00:38:04.061 --> 00:38:07.692
they want 2.8 sons on average
and 0.1 daughters,

00:38:07.692 --> 00:38:10.010
a factor of 28 difference.
 

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:15.775
In Kuwait before the Gulf War,
this is the 1991 war I think,

00:38:15.775 --> 00:38:21.054
Barbara Walters who you all
know, did a story on gender

00:38:21.054 --> 00:38:23.010
roles in Kuwait.
 

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.079
Yes, during the Gulf War she
was there,

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:28.235
and she noted that women
customarily walked about ten

00:38:28.235 --> 00:38:32.239
feet behind their husbands and
this happens in a lot of places,

00:38:32.239 --> 00:38:35.139
and a strong sign of female
deference and dependence.

00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:38.987
The husband walks without the
wife and the wife follows ten

00:38:38.987 --> 00:38:41.840
feet behind, you've heard of
that custom.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.590
The war takes place,
the Iraqi's get beaten,

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.820
she comes back to Kuwait to do
another story after the war,

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.835
and she was so pleased because
now the men walked behind the

00:38:56.835 --> 00:38:58.925
wives,
that the women were walking in

00:38:58.925 --> 00:39:00.503
front,
and so Barbara Walters said

00:39:00.503 --> 00:39:03.797
this is wonderful progress,
this is the American--they're

00:39:03.797 --> 00:39:07.891
catching on over there and so
she approached one of the women

00:39:07.891 --> 00:39:10.097
and said--
and the camera was rolling to

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:11.806
catch this,
she's a TV personality,

00:39:11.806 --> 00:39:14.429
"this is marvelous,"
says Barbara Walters,

00:39:14.429 --> 00:39:18.402
"can you tell the free
world just what enabled women to

00:39:18.402 --> 00:39:21.030
achieve this reversal of
roles?"

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:27.909
The Kuwaiti woman said,
"Land mines."

00:39:27.909 --> 00:39:33.380
And so it wasn't a reversal at
all.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:43.170
I think you get the idea of all
of this.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:47.096
We--there's deeper reasons,
I mean again one way is to put

00:39:47.096 --> 00:39:51.367
it down to Asian tradition and
that's not really any kind of an

00:39:51.367 --> 00:39:52.469
explanation.
 

00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:55.503
We like to think that people
are rational around the world

00:39:55.503 --> 00:39:58.429
and that there's some more
fundamental reason for it.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.679
A lot of the reasons that you
all said, what are some of the

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:04.929
extra reasons that I sort of
pushed aside for the moment?

00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:09.820
One was dowry issues and some
of you said some other things,

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.809
but there's a whole lot of
things, and the basic story is

00:40:14.809 --> 00:40:17.610
that in--
certainly in India and also in

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.130
traditional China the girl is
brought up by the parents,

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.697
gets married at quite a young
age, and by young teenage they

00:40:25.697 --> 00:40:29.260
get married and get shipped off
to the son--

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.885
the husband's family where she
works is then counted in that

00:40:32.885 --> 00:40:36.565
family and is worked--
usually works very hard and

00:40:36.565 --> 00:40:39.750
basically is a servant in that
family.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.983
The family that raises her has
the problem of investing in that

00:40:44.983 --> 00:40:48.248
girl,
putting a lot of money to raise

00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:50.469
that girl,
then, just as she's able to

00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:52.909
start working seriously and
maybe return some labor,

00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:56.789
some serious labor or some
money to the parents,

00:40:56.789 --> 00:41:01.429
she's gone and she works for
some other family.

00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:05.168
This is economically a very bad
thing and the people call

00:41:05.168 --> 00:41:08.639
raising girls like watering
someone else's garden.

00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:12.420
Then on top of that when the
dowry system is strong,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.320
which it is in India,
and going crazy,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.907
then at marriage they have to
provide a lot of money and this

00:41:18.907 --> 00:41:21.300
can go up to be like a year's
income,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.306
easily, to get the girl
married, and it's a great honor

00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:25.900
thing.
 

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.818
If you have a daughter you have
to get her married,

00:41:28.818 --> 00:41:32.320
so you have to pay dowry or
your family's honor goes away.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.581
This idea, that the girl is
just passed away just at the

00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:42.862
time she can be of value to you,
is kind of the rational actor

00:41:42.862 --> 00:41:46.460
theory of why there's all this
female discrimination.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:51.139
Anything strike you unexplained
about that?

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:53.920
Why is that--
Student:  It's the girl.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.789
Prof: It's the girl that
goes away all the time.

00:41:56.789 --> 00:41:58.590
Why can't the man go away?
 

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.309
This is, by the way,
characteristic of human

00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.789
societies.
 

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:05.045
I may have mentioned this to
you, the genetics shows that

00:42:05.045 --> 00:42:09.153
males in a village are related,
they've stayed there for

00:42:09.153 --> 00:42:13.992
hundreds or thousands of years,
and females move out,

00:42:13.992 --> 00:42:15.559
so exogamy.
 

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:17.590
Where have you seen exogamy
before?

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.840
Among the chimpanzees where the
females go out;

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.197
and so as far as we can tell
this is a vestige from our very

00:42:26.197 --> 00:42:30.849
original biological roots where
our reproductive system requires

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:35.353
not that the males fight each
other and the males disburse but

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:39.710
that the males stay together in
a military situation and the

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.409
females go out.
 

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:45.344
It's this very basic form
of--you can call it chimpanzee

00:42:45.344 --> 00:42:48.280
social organization that leads
to that.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.074
The females go out and
therefore the females are of no

00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:54.237
value to the family that brings
them up and therefore they're

00:42:54.237 --> 00:42:55.610
discriminated against.
 

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.864
The men stay together and they
have to have a

00:42:58.864 --> 00:43:02.639
protective--protect the village
against violence.

00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:05.786
In some places there's
a--either a tribe or a caste as

00:43:05.786 --> 00:43:08.695
you'll call it in India,
the Nayar, which are very

00:43:08.695 --> 00:43:10.239
military kind of cast.
 

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:12.889
What happens is they get
married very young,

00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:15.331
but then the man may,
or may not, spend one night

00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:18.079
with the wife and then he goes
off to the military,

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.228
and meanwhile,
the wife has all kinds of

00:43:20.228 --> 00:43:22.929
sexual relationships and its
quite formalized,

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:25.230
quite legal,
the women live in one big

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.543
house,
they don't really

00:43:26.543 --> 00:43:28.760
recognize--it's like the Na that
you read about,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.860
it's a female lineage society,
and then upper class men are

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.961
invited in to sleep with these
women and produce babies for

00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:39.275
them,
and then the men have 15 or 20

00:43:39.275 --> 00:43:40.719
years of military service.
 

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:44.474
Then they come home,
and only really at that time,

00:43:44.474 --> 00:43:46.849
do they pick up the marriage.
 

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:50.795
Again it's a very clear--in
this particular cultural

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.505
manifestation,
it's a very clear thing that

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:56.449
women are the reproducers,
men are the military ones,

00:43:56.449 --> 00:44:00.206
and, as in chimpanzees,
sort of a communal sexuality

00:44:00.206 --> 00:44:05.389
that who's the biological father
is not particularly important.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.739
Now, I want to switch gears
here in the time we have left,

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.619
and this whole lecture is about
South Asia,

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:24.121
and South Asia and East Asia
are the centers of female

00:44:24.121 --> 00:44:27.228
disadvantage,
but that doesn't go on in all

00:44:27.228 --> 00:44:28.289
of South Asia.
 

00:44:28.289 --> 00:44:30.210
As I've mentioned,
in Muslim countries that

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.489
basically does not happen.
 

00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:35.320
We're going to talk next about
two places;

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:42.199
one is Iowa and the other I'll
tell you in a moment.

00:44:42.199 --> 00:44:45.929
Iowa is a rich place, right?
 

00:44:45.929 --> 00:44:49.550
What is Iowa rich from?
 

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.101
Agriculture,
corn, it's a very,

00:44:52.101 --> 00:44:53.889
very fertile place.
 

00:44:53.889 --> 00:44:59.686
Well let me go back a little
bit, so I will tell you the

00:44:59.686 --> 00:45:05.590
country that I'm going to talk
about if I can find it.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.682
Again we worry a lot and have
induced some of the Asians to

00:45:09.682 --> 00:45:12.922
worry about the sex ratio,
that all these men won't get

00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:15.791
married,
but remember we're seeing sex

00:45:15.791 --> 00:45:18.739
ratio disturbances of 12% to
20%,

00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:22.121
and remember in Europe I showed
you this slide that a lot of

00:45:22.121 --> 00:45:25.231
places only 30%,
or 40% or 50% of people got

00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:27.889
married,
so the marriage imbalance is

00:45:27.889 --> 00:45:31.775
much--was much more severe in
Europe for hundreds of years

00:45:31.775 --> 00:45:33.550
than it is now in Asia.
 

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:38.882
The marriage pattern and the
social system in Europe made for

00:45:38.882 --> 00:45:44.570
a more extreme situation than
the female disadvantage in Asia.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.654
This not a great slide but this
is Bangladesh and what's in

00:45:48.654 --> 00:45:53.018
Bangladesh is this the Himalaya
mountains and here's China,

00:45:53.018 --> 00:45:56.110
and Nepal, Bangladesh over
here, India over here,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.695
and this is blown up a little
bit and what you see is this is

00:45:59.695 --> 00:46:00.889
the Bay of Bengal.
 

00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:04.599
Here is the Ganges River comes
out of the Himalayas.

00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:07.739
The Himalayas stretch all
across here,

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:10.989
the Ganges comes out of the
western Himalayas,

00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:14.389
the Brahmaputra comes out of
the eastern Himalayas,

00:46:14.389 --> 00:46:18.840
Bangladesh has lots of water
and this is all delta.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.438
You see this stuff,
this is all delta from--through

00:46:22.438 --> 00:46:26.541
geological time as the river
wanders around it puts down a

00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:27.909
delta out here.
 

00:46:27.909 --> 00:46:30.349
This is what the delta actually
looks like.

00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:35.103
There's a reading that you have
which says that the place is so

00:46:35.103 --> 00:46:39.702
bad that people are trying to
move out onto this land and try

00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:42.873
to farm on it,
and then of course a monsoon

00:46:42.873 --> 00:46:45.402
comes so the river--
the water rises and they're

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:45.909
wiped out.
 

00:46:45.909 --> 00:46:49.893
You'll have a reading about
that, so keep this picture in

00:46:49.893 --> 00:46:52.170
mind when you do that reading.
 

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:57.869
Now let's do the story on
agriculture.

00:46:57.869 --> 00:47:02.916
The people in Bangladesh are
Bengali's of course and the

00:47:02.916 --> 00:47:08.239
Bengali's are a large group that
are split actually between

00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:13.065
Bangladesh and eastern--
northeastern part of India,

00:47:13.065 --> 00:47:16.983
Calcutta is the capital,
Dhaka is the capital in

00:47:16.983 --> 00:47:19.737
Bangladesh,
and Calcutta is the capital of

00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:21.920
West Bengal which is part of
India,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.150
so partition split Bengali's
into two groups.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:29.373
Bangladesh is a very homogenous
country between Pakistan,

00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:34.050
India and Bangladesh the three
ones are the old British Raj.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.532
98% of them are Bengali's so
they speak the same language,

00:47:38.532 --> 00:47:42.780
have the same cultural
tradition and 88% are Muslim.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.932
Unlike India,
which you cannot talk about as

00:47:45.932 --> 00:47:50.260
a whole, you can really talk
about Bangladesh as a whole.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.460
Bengal is a very rich part of
the world,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.320
the Moguls who ruled from the
thirteenth--

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.949
so the Moguls were Muslim
invaders from--

00:47:57.949 --> 00:48:00.070
apparently I think from
Afghanistan,

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:05.170
conquered north India north of
that part,

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.130
and they ruled it from the
thirteenth century onward.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:12.780
They called Bengal the paradise
of nations.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.342
In the sixteenth century when
European traders came they were

00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:20.840
ecstatic over Bengal's abundance
and riches.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:26.159
Why was it so rich?
 

00:48:26.159 --> 00:48:29.590
I want to compare it to Iowa.
 

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.280
The size of Bangladesh is
56,000 square miles.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.610
Guess what the size of Iowa is?
 

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.856
56,000 square miles,
so they're very close to the

00:48:40.856 --> 00:48:44.239
same size, both are very
basically agricultural.

00:48:44.239 --> 00:48:48.099
Maytag makes washing machines,
or used to, in Iowa,

00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:50.956
but they're very heavily
agricultural,

00:48:50.956 --> 00:48:55.050
but Bangladesh has much better
climate than Iowa.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.460
They grow three crops a year in
Bangladesh.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.809
It's nice and warm there all
the time, but poor Iowa,

00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:03.900
anybody from Iowa here?
 

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.445
They can only grow one crop a
year and they grow winter wheat

00:49:06.445 --> 00:49:08.268
some, but basically it's one
crop a year.

00:49:08.268 --> 00:49:13.920
Bengal they can grow three
crops a year.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.471
Bangladesh has plenty of water,
I showed you,

00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:21.588
they have nothing but water
there so they never have

00:49:21.588 --> 00:49:25.059
droughts, and Iowa is not bad
for that.

00:49:25.059 --> 00:49:28.380
It has the Mississippi River on
one side,

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:28.860
the Nebraska River on the other
side,

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.909
but inside Iowa the rivers are
all very small,

00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:37.652
so if you go to the edges
there's rivers but inside not a

00:49:37.652 --> 00:49:42.989
huge amount of rivers and they
sometimes have droughts there.

00:49:42.989 --> 00:49:46.802
Both are fertile;
Bangladesh shows a low alluvial

00:49:46.802 --> 00:49:50.125
plain so the way land gets
naturally fertilized is water

00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:52.929
rushing--
glaciers on the mountaintop

00:49:52.929 --> 00:49:56.010
grind the rock and that glacier
flour,

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.510
as it's called,
gets into the river,

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.413
dissolves somewhat in the
river, and during flood season

00:50:00.413 --> 00:50:03.579
it spreads all this silt over
the farmland and that silt--

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:07.239
the minerals in the rock are
the fertilizer.

00:50:07.239 --> 00:50:10.717
Bangladesh has this--these
floods from the Himalayas that

00:50:10.717 --> 00:50:13.637
cover basically the whole
country and it gets it

00:50:13.637 --> 00:50:16.585
fertilizer for free,
it gets as lot of fertilizer

00:50:16.585 --> 00:50:20.690
and it gets it all for free,
so again the agriculture is

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.530
looking real good.
 

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.577
Iowa does not get this except
at the margins when the

00:50:25.577 --> 00:50:28.860
Mississippi floods and sometimes
the Nebraska floods,

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.577
so the interior of the country
they have to go and buy

00:50:32.577 --> 00:50:33.909
fertilizer there.
 

00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:37.692
By all these geographical kinds
of considerations and climatic

00:50:37.692 --> 00:50:40.668
kind of considerations,
Bangladesh should be much

00:50:40.668 --> 00:50:41.969
richer than Iowa.
 

00:50:41.969 --> 00:50:49.045
You compare three crops a year
to one crop and something like

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:51.639
three times as rich.
 

00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:56.519
Bangladesh's per capita
income--Iowa's income is 17

00:50:56.519 --> 00:51:02.474
times larger than Bangladesh's
and the difference is basically

00:51:02.474 --> 00:51:04.329
all population.
 

00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:08.639
Iowa's population is 2.9
million;

00:51:08.639 --> 00:51:13.599
Bangladesh is now about 140
million, so it's like 40 times

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:14.730
difference.
 

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:19.719
Bangladesh has 40 times as much
population as Iowa.

00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:23.331
Compared to every other place
in the world,

00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:27.715
here are a variety of places,
here's Bangladesh way,

00:51:27.715 --> 00:51:31.070
way out in front of everybody
else.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.820
Netherlands is considered
of--other places--

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:40.050
the next most crowded place and
it's also an agricultural place,

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.978
but--both of these--they don't
have big mountains or deserts or

00:51:43.978 --> 00:51:46.065
anything,
so all of the Netherlands is

00:51:46.065 --> 00:51:49.050
basically fertile and all of
Bangladesh is basically fertile,

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:54.956
but look at the difference in
population density and everybody

00:51:54.956 --> 00:51:59.510
else is less than either of
those two places.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:04.070
As you know,
as I've just mentioned,

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:06.840
the income in Bangladesh is
distressingly poor,

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.260
it's one of the poorest
countries in the world,

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:14.130
and the estimates are that its
population may double before,

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.789
if and when stabilizing.
 

00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:21.440
It's going to be very hard to
make things better in

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.650
Bangladesh.
 

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:26.615
Well going back,
Bangladesh had a stable

00:52:26.615 --> 00:52:30.068
population,
they had a kind of traditional

00:52:30.068 --> 00:52:31.413
birth,
very high birth,

00:52:31.413 --> 00:52:34.327
very high death rates so the
population grew very slowly if

00:52:34.327 --> 00:52:36.740
at all,
but about 1880 population

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.152
started to take off,
that's when again colonialism

00:52:40.152 --> 00:52:42.730
and what not--
the death rate started to

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:46.914
decline and they started adding
about three million people every

00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:47.579
decade.
 

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:50.291
What do three million extra
people do in a country the size

00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:50.760
of Iowa?
 

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.360
Not tiny but not especially big
either,

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.340
well there's some jungle--there
was some jungle in Bangladesh,

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.460
they cleared that and they
started farming but by the late

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.760
1930s the jungle was just
totally gone,

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.199
no more jungle land.
 

00:53:04.199 --> 00:53:07.146
In 1938, Biren Ganguli,
a Bengali himself,

00:53:07.146 --> 00:53:11.458
wrote "Every inch of land
that is fit for cultivation is

00:53:11.458 --> 00:53:12.679
already used.
 

00:53:12.679 --> 00:53:17.197
Every pathway or cattle track
is pared down by farmers on

00:53:17.197 --> 00:53:21.717
either side until he barely
leaves room for two people to

00:53:21.717 --> 00:53:25.510
pass each other on this narrow
track."

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:30.010
What did people do as the
population kept increasing?

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.396
They started moving out onto
these mud flats that I've shown

00:53:33.396 --> 00:53:35.119
you that are very temporary.
 

00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:38.715
The cyclones come in,
not only is there the normal

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:43.025
flooding from the rivers,
but the cyclones come in and

00:53:43.025 --> 00:53:48.105
you start getting these enormous
death tolls in a period of time

00:53:48.105 --> 00:53:51.409
in Bangladesh from climatic
problems,

00:53:51.409 --> 00:53:53.070
but it was really,
again, a population problem,

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.730
just like the deserts that I
told you about.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:59.983
People shouldn't be living on
these flats where they're going

00:53:59.983 --> 00:54:02.699
to be wiped out periodically.
 

00:54:02.699 --> 00:54:06.253
There was, for a while,
almost 100,000 deaths a year

00:54:06.253 --> 00:54:08.925
from storms,
erosion and flooding from these

00:54:08.925 --> 00:54:12.257
kind of--
just consider deaths from

00:54:12.257 --> 00:54:14.730
climatic water stuff.
 

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:20.989
It took about 60 years of the
population increase for Bengal,

00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:24.815
becoming one of the--to go from
one of the rich places of the

00:54:24.815 --> 00:54:26.804
world,
not industrialized,

00:54:26.804 --> 00:54:31.275
but rich on their agricultural
produce to what was standardly

00:54:31.275 --> 00:54:33.510
described as a basket case.
 

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.141
Now all the focus is on Africa,
but, not so long ago,

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:43.306
Bangladesh was considered in
just as bad shape as Africa is

00:54:43.306 --> 00:54:44.018
now.
 

00:54:44.018 --> 00:54:48.722
It was constantly on the news,
stories of disaster in

00:54:48.722 --> 00:54:54.420
Bangladesh and you're supposed
to cry at that and give money.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:55:00.485
Bangladesh was clearly one of
those places that was caught in

00:55:00.485 --> 00:55:03.719
one of these Malthusian traps.
 

00:55:03.719 --> 00:55:06.340
The arable land and this is a
somewhat old figure in the

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:10.625
population has increased a lot,
is 0.1 hectare per person,

00:55:10.625 --> 00:55:14.518
that's a quarter of an acre a
person.

00:55:14.518 --> 00:55:17.030
Just to compare you to that,
any of you from farm places?

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:18.539
How many of you are from farm
places?

00:55:18.539 --> 00:55:21.465
Every year I always get
some--do you know what--what's

00:55:21.465 --> 00:55:23.619
the size of the farms where you
live?

00:55:23.619 --> 00:55:24.789
Where do you live?
 

00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:26.159
Student:  I live outside
of Cleveland.

00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:27.550
Prof: Outside of
Cleveland?

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:28.710
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.445
Prof: That's not one of
the big farms,

00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:34.429
but do you know roughly the
size of the farms?

00:55:34.429 --> 00:55:35.230
Student:  30 acres.
 

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:36.219
Prof: Thirty acres.
 

00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:37.230
Student:  A small one.
 

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.402
Prof: Okay,
so that's small farms,

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:42.769
out West they can be thousands,
like the real commercial farms,

00:55:42.769 --> 00:55:44.019
thousands of acres.
 

00:55:44.019 --> 00:55:46.239
Here's 0.1 hectare per person.
 

00:55:46.239 --> 00:55:50.226
I used to live in Bethany which
was sort of a northwest suburb

00:55:50.226 --> 00:55:53.755
of New Haven and our house was--
our part of Bethany was zoned

00:55:53.755 --> 00:55:56.190
for three acres and I didn't
have to live off of it,

00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.800
there was just a house on that.
 

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:03.431
If you had a house you had to
have three acres so that was

00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:07.543
enough so that,
in Bengal, Bangladesh 30

00:56:07.543 --> 00:56:13.186
families would live on these
three acres at 0.1 hectare per

00:56:13.186 --> 00:56:14.159
person.
 

00:56:14.159 --> 00:56:17.909
All of the indicators in this
time starting,

00:56:17.909 --> 00:56:24.362
say in the 1950s or 1960s,
was that Bangladesh would not

00:56:24.362 --> 00:56:28.469
be a country in which you
would--

00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:31.505
where you find a desire to
limit fertility or the practice

00:56:31.505 --> 00:56:32.889
of fertility limitation.
 

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:36.838
It's, as I've said,
almost all Muslim and it's a

00:56:36.838 --> 00:56:40.030
conservative version of Islam
there.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:42.190
Infant and child mortality was
high,

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:45.280
25% of the children died before
the age of five,

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.907
but that had been coming down
slowly as I showed you for

00:56:48.907 --> 00:56:50.159
roughly 20 years.
 

00:56:50.159 --> 00:56:53.309
Women had very low social
status there,

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:56.679
most of them in--were subject
to purdah,

00:56:56.679 --> 00:57:00.083
which they not only have to
dress so they can't be seen when

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.867
they're outside of the house,
but they generally couldn't go

00:57:03.867 --> 00:57:07.681
outside of the house at all
unless accompanied a male member

00:57:07.681 --> 00:57:08.780
of the family.
 

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.159
Men were fairly free to abuse
women,

00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:15.327
and I read you the first
lecture I think some case of the

00:57:15.327 --> 00:57:18.610
battery acid being thrown at
women in more recent time,

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:22.070
so that still continues.
 

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.869
Last time I mentioned that one
of the reasons that people want

00:57:24.869 --> 00:57:27.257
children is for old age
security, who's going to take

00:57:27.257 --> 00:57:28.590
care of me in my old age.
 

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:30.800
And, of course,
Bangladesh was very poor,

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.360
had no social security system,
so the families were,

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.050
of course, dependent on
children for their old age,

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.679
they were dependent on sons for
their old age,

00:57:38.679 --> 00:57:40.449
so that means that you had to
have a lot of children to make

00:57:40.449 --> 00:57:40.659
sure.
 

00:57:40.659 --> 00:57:44.724
You can't have a daughter,
you've got to have sons to make

00:57:44.724 --> 00:57:48.289
sure that you have somebody to
take care of you.

00:57:48.289 --> 00:57:53.327
During the period of time I'm
going to talk about here are

00:57:53.327 --> 00:57:58.190
some of the major disasters in
Bangladesh over time,

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.719
so this is one really very
famous one,

00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:03.670
the Bengal famine of 1943.
 

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:11.284
They were already on the edge,
and then World War II hits and

00:58:11.284 --> 00:58:18.773
a variety of things happen and
2.5 million people die in the

00:58:18.773 --> 00:58:20.170
famine.
 

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.980
Here's some of the cyclones,
various cyclones.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:26.076
They had a war when they were
trying to get independent of

00:58:26.076 --> 00:58:28.519
West Pakistan,
they had a war and these things

00:58:28.519 --> 00:58:30.153
happened,
another cyclone,

00:58:30.153 --> 00:58:34.972
floods, all of them,
and so all kinds of problems

00:58:34.972 --> 00:58:37.219
beset the country.
 

00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:41.518
Now during this period,
that is the critical period for

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.380
population issues,
the per capita GDP,

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:48.333
the gross domestic product,
basically didn't change,

00:58:48.333 --> 00:58:51.800
a little bit up but not
enormously up.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.639
It basically had a flat per
capita economy,

00:58:55.639 --> 00:58:58.585
per capita GDP,
so again, the total economy was

00:58:58.585 --> 00:59:01.789
growing but more and more people
ate it all up,

00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:06.809
so basically the per capita GDP
doesn't change in this period.

00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:19.018
What happened was that Malthus
had been in India and the

00:59:19.018 --> 00:59:21.275
Indian--
the whole Indian subcontinent

00:59:21.275 --> 00:59:22.929
paid a lot of attention to
Malthus,

00:59:22.929 --> 00:59:25.018
so they had been aware--India,
Pakistan,

00:59:25.018 --> 00:59:28.086
Bangladesh had been aware of
population issues and aware of

00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:31.260
the Malthusian ideas about it
for a long time and the British

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.380
of course trained their civil
servants of the countries when

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.130
they got independence it was the
same people,

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:38.539
so this was in their mind.
 

00:59:38.539 --> 00:59:42.159
In fact the South Asia,
originally India and Pakistan,

00:59:42.159 --> 00:59:45.985
were some of the very first
countries to institute family

00:59:45.985 --> 00:59:47.489
planning programs.
 

00:59:47.489 --> 00:59:52.639
The one in Pakistan was not
particularly successful,

00:59:52.639 --> 00:59:55.922
the one in India is now much
better but did not start out

00:59:55.922 --> 00:59:58.163
successfully,
but after the war of

00:59:58.163 --> 01:00:01.032
independence,
when Bangladesh split from West

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:05.139
Pakistan the government really
was aware of these problems,

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:09.434
had a Malthusian attitude and
they really decided that they

01:00:09.434 --> 01:00:13.360
must start to get some control
of their population.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.168
The government supported and
instituted a family planning

01:00:17.168 --> 01:00:21.248
program for the whole country
and international organizations

01:00:21.248 --> 01:00:23.634
said,
'OK, you want to do this,

01:00:23.634 --> 01:00:26.905
we will help you,' and
especially there's a group

01:00:26.905 --> 01:00:30.655
called The International
Diarrheal Research Organization

01:00:30.655 --> 01:00:34.677
which was one of the ones that
had discovered and pushed the

01:00:34.677 --> 01:00:36.860
oral rehydration packets.
 

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.143
Many, many--huge numbers of
infant deaths in poor countries

01:00:41.143 --> 01:00:42.762
due--
they get diarrhea and

01:00:42.762 --> 01:00:45.860
diarrhea--the bug doesn't kill
you but you lose enough water

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.065
through the diarrhea that you
die basically of dehydration and

01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:52.268
all you need to do is to have a
little packet of water,

01:00:52.268 --> 01:00:56.259
salt and sugar and as long as
the water is not terribly

01:00:56.259 --> 01:01:00.543
polluted the child will stay
alive and will eventually kick

01:01:00.543 --> 01:01:03.130
out the virus or the bacterium.
 

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.974
This International Diarrheal
Research Group,

01:01:05.974 --> 01:01:08.489
are very well respected,
and they said,

01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:12.659
'okay we will also help you
with family planning programs.'

01:01:12.659 --> 01:01:19.110
What resulted was a countrywide
program.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:22.449
Now at this same time,
we're talking the early 1970s,

01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:27.420
most of the developed world had
the idea that they--

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.068
what did they say,
they saw rich countries have

01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:32.210
few children,
poor countries have a lot of

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.469
children,
what's the cause?

01:01:33.469 --> 01:01:35.219
Well money is the cause.
 

01:01:35.219 --> 01:01:37.371
When you get rich you want to
have fewer children,

01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.701
we're going to have a lecture
on that very interesting

01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:40.360
phenomenon.
 

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.824
A lot of developing countries
and East European countries

01:01:43.824 --> 01:01:47.101
rejected the whole idea of
family planning as a way of

01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:50.641
improving the economy and said,
no development is the best

01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:51.400
contraceptive.
 

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.583
That was the rule,
development is the best

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.472
contraceptive,
that there's no way in,

01:01:55.472 --> 01:01:57.867
a poor place like Bangladesh,
that you're going to get

01:01:57.867 --> 01:02:00.226
fertility down because of all
these reasons that we've

01:02:00.226 --> 01:02:02.144
mentioned,
but if you develop the country

01:02:02.144 --> 01:02:04.389
economically than it will
naturally come down and the

01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:06.289
government doesn't have to mess
with it,

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.989
doesn't have to set up family
planning programs.

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:12.262
Everybody predicted,
strenuously,

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:18.295
that Bangladesh could do what
it wanted with family planning

01:02:18.295 --> 01:02:24.228
programs until and unless they
developed economically there

01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:26.989
would be no progress.
 

01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:33.443
What they did was they--prior
to this program they had tried a

01:02:33.443 --> 01:02:35.559
variety of things.
 

01:02:35.559 --> 01:02:37.949
In Pakistan one of the programs
was,

01:02:37.949 --> 01:02:41.637
well people are culturally into
having a lot of children and so

01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:45.800
we must work with their culture,
and must work with traditional

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.050
birth attendants.
 

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:49.422
In Pakistan,
including Bangladesh at the

01:02:49.422 --> 01:02:53.010
time,
they had women called Daiys who

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:56.909
are basically local health
providers,

01:02:56.909 --> 01:03:01.284
herbal women,
midwives for births and stuff

01:03:01.284 --> 01:03:04.753
like that,
but they had basically no

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:07.119
modern training whatsoever.
 

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:12.306
In the first implementation of
Pakistan's program they gave

01:03:12.306 --> 01:03:17.226
these Daiys various forms of
birth control and they were

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.909
supposed to give them out.
 

01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:21.239
It didn't work.
 

01:03:21.239 --> 01:03:21.909
Why didn't it work?
 

01:03:21.909 --> 01:03:25.105
The Daiys themselves were older
women in general who did not use

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:27.539
contraception and did not think
it was moral,

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:30.659
did not think it worked,
and had all kinds of bad

01:03:30.659 --> 01:03:32.090
attitudes toward it.
 

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.623
So, if someone tries to sell
you something,

01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:36.978
and they don't themselves
believe in it,

01:03:36.978 --> 01:03:39.030
you generally don't accept it.
 

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.708
Plus, economically,
they made very little by

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:44.762
distributing these kind of
contraceptives from the

01:03:44.762 --> 01:03:48.047
government,
but they could make quite a bit

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:52.404
more by attending the births
that they charge a good fee for

01:03:52.404 --> 01:03:56.170
births where the government set
the little bit,

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.695
they wanted to have the
contraceptives very fairly free

01:03:58.695 --> 01:04:01.161
to the people,
so they didn't pay the Daiys

01:04:01.161 --> 01:04:01.820
very much.
 

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.458
The Daiys would get all the
condoms especially and sort of

01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:07.235
bury them somewhere and claim to
the government that they had

01:04:07.235 --> 01:04:09.320
distributed them and then made a
lot of--

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.565
not a lot of money,
but their money from attending

01:04:12.565 --> 01:04:15.679
the births that hadn't been
averted by this,

01:04:15.679 --> 01:04:17.869
so it didn't work.
 

01:04:17.869 --> 01:04:20.195
They learn, these are again the
first countries in the world to

01:04:20.195 --> 01:04:22.407
have family planning programs
and they didn't know how to do

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:22.670
it.
 

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:26.309
You have to--it's not given
that this is the way you do it.

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:31.253
Eventually they started the
program that I described to you

01:04:31.253 --> 01:04:35.940
somewhat last time where the
women can't come out of the

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:41.139
house so you hire a high status
woman from that village,

01:04:41.139 --> 01:04:44.110
known to the women,
has high status,

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:47.929
is herself using contraception,
thinks it's a wonderful thing,

01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:50.862
you train her how to deal not
only with the woman but the

01:04:50.862 --> 01:04:52.800
woman has very little power
there,

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.309
to deal with the husband,
to deal especially with the

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.364
mother-in-law,
and for that you need a high

01:04:57.364 --> 01:05:00.143
status woman that can go into a
house and start discussing these

01:05:00.143 --> 01:05:03.467
things,
because even talking about

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:09.577
anything to do with sex or
reproduction is not a socially

01:05:09.577 --> 01:05:11.760
acceptable thing.
 

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:19.423
They started this program and
initially you got this kind of a

01:05:19.423 --> 01:05:20.429
thing.
 

01:05:20.429 --> 01:05:24.186
Veena Siddharth talked about
this, that when you start a

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:27.853
family planning program,
this is an older version of the

01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:31.210
family planning program not the
one I've just described.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:35.101
What you see is they
took--there was a place called

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:38.025
Matlab,
one of the districts in

01:05:38.025 --> 01:05:40.503
Bangladesh,
and they chose some villages,

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:43.159
they wanted to know if what
they were doing was successful,

01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:45.559
some villages they gave this
family planning program to and

01:05:45.559 --> 01:05:48.590
other villages they didn't,
as a control region.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:52.039
Here is during this period up
until 1977 the comparison area

01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.380
where they didn't do anything
special.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.791
The government had a small
program but nothing much was

01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:58.550
happening.
 

01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:01.759
Now, the International
Diarrheal Research Group comes

01:06:01.759 --> 01:06:04.289
in with this somewhat updated
program,

01:06:04.289 --> 01:06:07.840
not the one I showed you,
and what happens immediately

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.659
there's great success and
they're jumping up and down,

01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:16.545
okay this is true,
but then it peaks and then over

01:06:16.545 --> 01:06:18.639
time it falls down.
 

01:06:18.639 --> 01:06:22.389
What's happening here is a
small fraction of the women--

01:06:22.389 --> 01:06:25.117
well 20% is not terrible,
but a small fraction of the

01:06:25.117 --> 01:06:27.525
women,
before the program comes in,

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.460
want to limit their births.
 

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.530
You give them anything,
they accept it immediately.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:35.313
That this initial rise and
that's very standard for family

01:06:35.313 --> 01:06:36.289
planning programs.
 

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:41.099
That you get an initial rise
and then it falls off,

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:43.476
and over the long term if
you're evaluating the program

01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:46.980
here you think it's wonderful,
but if you're evaluating the

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.690
program here it's kind of
worthless.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:53.193
Veena was talking about that,
that she comes out of this

01:06:53.193 --> 01:06:57.143
economic World Bank perspective
and they're very impressed with

01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.800
these periods of time.
 

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.427
This is a program that,
in retrospect,

01:07:01.427 --> 01:07:05.402
we would say really didn't
work, although it helps a fair

01:07:05.402 --> 01:07:07.250
fraction of the women.
 

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.668
Then you put in the good
program that I described to you

01:07:10.668 --> 01:07:12.833
and now what happens,
the later time,

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:16.989
so we stop the previous--
the previous graph stopped in

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:22.039
1977 at this level of
contraceptive acceptance,

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.460
so they had a program that
didn't work,

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.146
and then they start sending
these village working women into

01:07:27.146 --> 01:07:31.210
the homes of the other women and
now you get another big rise,

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.610
that this is now successful
immediately,

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:37.550
but now the success continues.
 

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:41.440
Meanwhile there's modernization
and there's social diffusion

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.293
that these areas,
the comparison areas are

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:47.300
actually intermixed with the
treatment areas,

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.409
and they hear a lot about
what's going on in there and so

01:07:50.409 --> 01:07:52.518
for that reason and others are
not--

01:07:52.518 --> 01:07:54.590
we don't really have data to
say why a rise,

01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:58.070
but even in the comparison area
it starts to rise.

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:01.088
In one of your readings about
Taiwan where you have family

01:08:01.088 --> 01:08:03.260
planning, a very similar kind of
thing.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.719
It makes a big point that,
they did have some data,

01:08:05.719 --> 01:08:08.369
that they had villages where
they had a family planning

01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:10.489
program,
and then as soon as this was

01:08:10.489 --> 01:08:13.876
heard about in the surrounding
regions people would come into

01:08:13.876 --> 01:08:16.925
the treatment region to get
treatment so fertility goes

01:08:16.925 --> 01:08:17.488
down.
 

01:08:17.488 --> 01:08:26.949
One of the factors behind this
is certainly diffusion of the

01:08:26.949 --> 01:08:31.279
ideas of family planning.
 

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:37.237
This thing in Bangladesh has
had terrible significance for

01:08:37.237 --> 01:08:43.300
what we believe about family
planning programs and people's

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:47.180
acceptance of it,
because up until this time it

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.560
was really dogma that you have
to have economic development and

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.850
you have to have a degree of
literacy,

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.747
and you have to have some
degree of women's status before

01:08:56.747 --> 01:08:59.880
people would want to limit their
fertility.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.189
Then you go into Bangladesh
with a well funded,

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:07.373
well thought out,
well run program,

01:09:07.373 --> 01:09:09.810
and it starts working.
 

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:13.680
Now Bangladesh is--its
fertility has kept falling and

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.996
it's in there with a lot of
countries that are a lot richer

01:09:17.996 --> 01:09:18.890
than it.
 

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.814
India is as lot richer,
Egypt is a lot richer than

01:09:21.814 --> 01:09:25.219
Bangladesh, and they all now
have come to more or less the

01:09:25.219 --> 01:09:27.189
same kind of fertility level.
 

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:32.868
It now is no longer really
believed--

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:35.859
it's believed that women almost
everywhere,

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:38.974
in this case it must be the
men, because the men and the

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.069
mother-in-law's control the
issue--

01:09:41.069 --> 01:09:43.134
really do want to reduce
fertility and if you give them

01:09:43.134 --> 01:09:48.729
the option,
they will accept it.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:54.868
Along the way other places have
learned other lessons,

01:09:54.868 --> 01:09:59.591
so India next door had a much
stronger central government

01:09:59.591 --> 01:10:03.881
because of the Gandhi effect,
Gandhi was such a national hero

01:10:03.881 --> 01:10:05.729
to all the ethnic groups in
India,

01:10:05.729 --> 01:10:09.020
so the government was strong
and Nehru was very strong,

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.850
and Nehru's daughter
Mrs. Gandhi was very strong,

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:15.448
and they were Westernized,
under the Malthusian influence,

01:10:15.448 --> 01:10:19.578
and they decided that they need
a family planning program also.

01:10:19.578 --> 01:10:24.818
Actually India was even before
this, but again they didn't know

01:10:24.818 --> 01:10:28.788
to do it, and they decided to
use incentives.

01:10:28.788 --> 01:10:30.270
That's when economists keep
telling us,

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:31.788
every time you take an
economics course,

01:10:31.788 --> 01:10:35.520
people respond to incentives
and so they decided to use

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.250
incentives to get people to take
on family planning.

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:43.755
There's a lot of debate about
this issue of incentives and one

01:10:43.755 --> 01:10:47.298
part of it,
one article I read about people

01:10:47.298 --> 01:10:51.426
in villages in Nepal like the
one that Veena was in,

01:10:51.426 --> 01:10:52.560
pretty far.
 

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.448
They have to take a whole day
off from work to go down to get

01:10:56.448 --> 01:10:58.653
a contraceptive,
then they have to go back,

01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:01.304
and what kind can they get,
because they can't go this

01:11:01.304 --> 01:11:03.408
every month to get something
new,

01:11:03.408 --> 01:11:06.988
and they can't take time off
from their work or their chores,

01:11:06.988 --> 01:11:09.868
so it's a real major economic
expense.

01:11:09.868 --> 01:11:13.445
Not the contraceptive itself,
but the time and effort needed

01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:16.719
if they have to take a bus,
it may be very expensive in

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:17.810
their economy.
 

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:26.150
So part of the idea of giving
incentives is to just repay the

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:30.600
woman for her time and effort.
 

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.631
India had started out that way
but the program was not very

01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:35.881
well run,
it wasn't--they didn't have the

01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:38.863
big international help that
Bangladesh had and the program

01:11:38.863 --> 01:11:41.396
wasn't terribly well run,
and so they sort of got

01:11:41.396 --> 01:11:44.051
frustrated at the results and
their population kept going and

01:11:44.051 --> 01:11:47.975
there was a time in India,
way before this current boom

01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:50.595
that India is--
has been going through,

01:11:50.595 --> 01:11:52.770
and may or may not still be
going through,

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:56.064
and so the government got
frustrated and the population

01:11:56.064 --> 01:11:59.195
grew and they saw their hopes,
there's this window of

01:11:59.195 --> 01:12:02.140
opportunity that I was talking
about from modernization,

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.689
if the population gets too
dense that window may close.

01:12:04.689 --> 01:12:11.203
The government got desperate
and started introducing some

01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:14.445
coercion,
some of it is incentive like

01:12:14.445 --> 01:12:17.877
transistor radios to the men--
to get the men to get

01:12:17.877 --> 01:12:20.787
sterilized and that was
wonderful but who got

01:12:20.787 --> 01:12:23.344
sterilized,
the old men that weren't going

01:12:23.344 --> 01:12:26.858
to have children anyway,
but I get a transistor radio or

01:12:26.858 --> 01:12:28.529
some money out of this.
 

01:12:28.529 --> 01:12:32.658
The whole thing crashed and it
came entangled as in America,

01:12:32.658 --> 01:12:36.658
reproduction and politics,
so the opposition to the--

01:12:36.658 --> 01:12:40.952
people didn't especially like
it because it's changing their

01:12:40.952 --> 01:12:41.680
culture.
 

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.844
But, the opposition took hold
of it and blew up all the

01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:47.112
abuses,
no question there were abuses,

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:50.063
blew up the abuses,
the newspapers blared the

01:12:50.063 --> 01:12:54.530
abuses and it became a very big
political thing and the Congress

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:57.439
Party government fell because of
that.

01:12:57.439 --> 01:13:00.886
India has since sort of--then
they went through a period where

01:13:00.886 --> 01:13:04.109
they sort of did nothing in
family planning because it was

01:13:04.109 --> 01:13:07.104
in such bad favor and now
they've started up again and

01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:09.140
things are going a lot better.
 

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:15.217
I think the story of this is
that the idea which was

01:13:15.217 --> 01:13:20.939
prevalent up until the
Bangladesh experiment,

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:24.565
that only rich countries are
going to reduce their fertility

01:13:24.565 --> 01:13:28.332
is just plain wrong,
and now as the fertility

01:13:28.332 --> 01:13:32.523
transition goes through Asia,
it's now amazing,

01:13:32.523 --> 01:13:35.850
places--very poor places what's
happening there.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.367
Ceylon was one of the first
countries in Asia to get down to

01:13:39.367 --> 01:13:42.837
replacement level,
very poor, Ceylon is not a rich

01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:44.895
place,
Kerala one of the poorest

01:13:44.895 --> 01:13:47.810
provinces of India is down at
replacement level;

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:51.155
all kinds of countries
Thailand, Indonesia,

01:13:51.155 --> 01:13:55.538
all have really reduced their
fertility at amazingly low

01:13:55.538 --> 01:13:58.090
levels of per capita income.
 

01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:00.738
Income is clearly important,
one doesn't want to throw it

01:14:00.738 --> 01:14:02.608
out,
it's perfectly clear that

01:14:02.608 --> 01:14:06.237
things are easier if you have
more money and there's reasons

01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:09.929
why richer people have fewer
children which we'll go into but

01:14:09.929 --> 01:14:12.390
it is not a necessary
prerequisite.

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:16.672
We will see--have a good
vacation, enjoy,

01:14:16.672 --> 01:14:21.600
come back refreshed and I will
see you then.

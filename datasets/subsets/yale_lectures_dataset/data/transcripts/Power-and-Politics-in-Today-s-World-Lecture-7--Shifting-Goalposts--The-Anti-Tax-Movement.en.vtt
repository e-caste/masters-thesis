00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.663
- Let's start with The Daily Show.

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:17.319
(fanfare)
(audience applauding)

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.380
- You're here!

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.213
- Good to be with you.

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:24.623
- The evil Grover Norquist.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.160
- Sweetie pie.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.180
- There you go, "Debacle."

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.320
So listen, you've come up with the pledge.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.890
Here's where you seem
to have stepped in it.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.750
You came up with this pledge

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.650
that you don't want
people to raise taxes ever

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.660
and you got a bunch of
Republicans to sign it,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.820
mostly Republicans to sign.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850
It strikes me as people can come up

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.660
with any pledge they want.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.250
The people seem like at fault for this

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.960
if you don't feel like
this is a good thing

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.670
are the people who sign it.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.170
I can come up with any pledge.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.170
- There have been over time

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910
quite a number of questionnaires

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.810
and pledges and things

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.350
that somebody says you should
make all these commitments.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.060
The reason why the pledge
has been successful

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.027
is that it's simple.

00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:09.610
They're not 12 moving parts.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.790
Remember some group in Iowa

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.650
had like a 14 part pledge

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.690
including how you spent your evenings

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.300
and they wanted candidates to sign it.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.133
- That's my group.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.910
The how you spend your evenings pledge.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.550
- They couldn't get a lot of signers.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.770
The pledge is look,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.810
as long as I'm a congressman,
or a senator, or president,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.790
I'm not gonna raise taxes.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.020
When I see a problem,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.220
I'm gonna reform government,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.160
I'm gonna spend less,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.540
I'm not gonna raise taxes

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.450
in the pledge ever.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.060
- Now, what about the idea though

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.960
that because it's so
simple and so absolutist,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270
that's it's almost impossible?

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.150
Like if I had a pledge that said

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.550
America can never go to war.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.383
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:44.830
- And I got a bunch of people to sign it.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.430
People would think,
well, that's unrealistic.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.040
It's too simplistic
for this complex world.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.657
Do you worry that your pledge?

00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:53.540
I mean, Reagan raised taxes, I don't know,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.420
seven times, eight times?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.130
- Yeah, and George Washington
lost the Battle of New York.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.490
That was not on purpose.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.533
I mean, Reagan didn't want to raise taxes.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.200
- Wait, Reagan didn't want to raise taxes?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.033
- No.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.060
- But he did it eight times?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
- No.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.810
- He had a congress.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.050
He had a congress

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.870
with whom he raised
taxes a number of times.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.750
When I talked to him about it,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.070
he thought the big tax increase
was the '82 tax increase.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.610
- I talked to him about it too, Grover.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.155
You're not the only one who talked to him.

00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:25.413
He told me that he did it eight times.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.800
- The '82 tax increase
which was the large one,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.420
he said was the biggest
mistake of his presidency

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.140
because, of course,
remember he was promised,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.810
oh, if you raise taxes, we'll
give you $3 of spending cuts.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.310
- But then he kept raising them.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.760
'82, '83, '85.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.470
I have a whole list here.
- Yeah.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.900
- So would you have run
somebody against him?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.733
- No.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.130
The good news is here.
- Why not?

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.720
- Well one, he hadn't signed the pledge,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.570
and we didn't have a base of support.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.610
- So that's Grover Norquist

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.123
who turns out to be a pivotal
player in the class today.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
We're gonna look at the anti-tax movement

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.080
and our agenda is gonna
be first to go back

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.880
and look at the history of it.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.890
I think it is one of the two

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.330
most successful social
movements of the 20th century,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.213
the other being the civil rights movement

00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:28.213
in that it completely
transformed the political economy

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.880
and the landscape of politics

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.670
perhaps irreversibly
we'll see as we go along.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.350
So our agenda is we're gonna go back

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.920
and look at the origins
of the anti-tax movement.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.550
Then I'm gonna take a step
back to bringing a little,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.360
again, some of the machinery
of political science

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.370
into our conversation

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.350
and talk a little bit
about referendum politics

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.670
because the origins of
the anti-tax movement

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.483
have a great deal to do
with that as we will see.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:06.270
We'll then look at 1994 as a pivot point

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.670
in the anti-tax movement

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.500
and in the transformation
of American politics.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.600
We'll then zero in on a case
study of the estate tax.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.850
The estate tax is the most progressive tax

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.150
in the US tax code.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.737
It was put there in
1916 to fund World War I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.730
and it was repealed as part
of the Bush tax cut of 2001

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.830
which we'll talk about in some detail.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.760
And it was repealled quite remarkably

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.318
with significant support from Democrats

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:49.630
in the House and the
Senate despite the fact

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.560
that all of it is paid by
the top 2% of income earners

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.380
and more than half of it is paid,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.970
at that time, was paid
by the top half of 1%,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.240
people with estates in
excess of 20 million dollars.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.890
And so we'll do something of a whodunit

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.480
about how the estate tax was
actually repealed in 2001.

00:05:13.904 --> 00:05:17.170
We'll then talk more about tax cuts

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.590
and the republican
coalition as it has evolved.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.180
This intersects somewhat with
the lecture I gave a week ago

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.310
on the resurgence of conservative
parties across the West,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.600
but it has a distinctive American flavor.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.680
And then we'll end by considering

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.760
how far the goal posts
have actually shifted

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.040
as a result of this social movement.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.280
But let's go back to the beginning

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.840
and the origins of the anti-tax movement

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.830
I think really go back to the early 1970s

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.120
and particularly after
the Nixon Administration

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.610
had collapsed as a result of Watergate,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.590
there was a lot of soul
searching among conservatives.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.700
The democrats had been in
charge of Congress for decades

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.220
and there were a number of
so-called activist think tanks

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.440
that either emerged or
grew very dramatically,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.700
places like The Heritage Foundation,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.420
the Cato Institute,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.143
the American Enterprise Institute,

00:06:30.687 --> 00:06:34.437
people, wealthy individuals
and organizations

00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:39.820
put huge amounts of money
into these think tanks

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.490
and the idea was not to
come up with a strategy

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.400
for winning the next election.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.122
The idea was rather to rethink

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:52.090
the republican agenda for the medium run.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.350
And they put their money into think tanks

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.620
quite self-consciously,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.660
people like Feulner and others,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.053
the Coke family.

00:07:01.498 --> 00:07:04.410
Their reasoning was
that they really needed

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.600
to change the ideological terrain.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.120
So this was three categories

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.760
of interests, institutions, and ideas,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.840
and they really felt

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.840
that the new deal great society consensus

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.920
had to be tackled at the realm

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.440
of the ideological justifications for it

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.720
out there in the American polity.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.450
And they thought that trying to do this

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.080
in the universities was hopeless

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.210
because the universities
were massively dominated

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.990
by people to the left
of center, by liberals,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.780
and so the thought was a much
more efficient way to do this

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.040
would be to do it through think tanks.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.143
And so they invested a lot of money

00:07:48.143 --> 00:07:50.930
into these activist think tanks

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.930
that would help design what
we're talking about today

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.860
and their general revival
of pro-market politics

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.421
that we were talking
about last week at home,

00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:11.016
and then also the aggressive agenda abroad

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:13.730
that we're gonna be talking about later

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.730
when we see what happened after 9/11.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:24.589
But they were really
concerned with taking head on

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.040
the consensus that had
informed the new deal,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.240
the great society for decades.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.610
And there was a lot of research
done in these think tanks

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.500
and a lot of activism that
came out of these think tanks.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.100
They were frankly,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.740
if you go to The Heritage
Foundation in Washington, DC,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.550
and you look at the signs on the elevator,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.340
it's very clear what it is
that their agenda is about.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.342
Small government, shrinking
the welfare state,

00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:03.342
and fundamentally
strengthening market forces.

00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:08.394
So that was one piece of it.

00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:13.099
In my book with Michael Graetz
that I have on the syllabus,

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:18.099
we have several chapters
that go through that history.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.010
But then secondly,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:25.010
the other more specific source
of the anti-tax movement

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.650
goes back to Proposition 13 in California.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.430
Many people, this is again,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.470
be taking some people down memory lane

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.140
and introducing others to some history

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.290
about which they may
not be fully informed.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.290
So let's go back to June
of 1978 in California.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.528
(fanfare)

00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:54.725
- Good evening.

00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:57.190
Here in California in
the primary tomorrow,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.280
people have the rare and no
doubt pleasing opportunity

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.422
to vote their taxes down,

00:10:02.422 --> 00:10:04.070
to tell the politicians

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.410
that they will pay this much and no more.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.630
Proposition 13, it's called,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.940
and it's an absolute flat ban

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.420
on how much property tax
they can charge homeowners.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.050
It is thought to be about
as much a vote against

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.530
big, expensive, wasteful government

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.030
as it is against the property tax.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.180
And it seems that nobody
loves government anymore.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.590
Here's Don Harris.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.180
- By far the most controversial

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.670
of the tax reform measures
is Proposition 13.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.440
Simply put, this amendment would roll back

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.980
the assessments on all property
to the 1975, '76 levels.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.140
It will allow assessments to increase

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.527
at the rate of only 2% per year

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:46.890
and it would limit property taxes

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.833
to 1% of that assessed value.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.430
In terms of taxes paid,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.900
that means the owner of a
$60,000 home in Los Angeles

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.490
would find his taxes reduced
from about $1,400 a year

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.163
to about $600 a year.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.550
Proposition 13 applies to all property,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.430
businesses as well as homes.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.510
Big companies would
get big tax reductions.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.260
Pacific Telephone, for example,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.400
will receive a tax cut of
about 130 million dollars

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.063
if Proposition 13 passes.

00:11:16.538 --> 00:11:21.538
- So Proposition 13 promises huge tax cuts

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.740
to all California tax payers.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.070
This is a so called ballot initiative

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.787
which we think of as
something like a referendum.

00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:32.130
You vote only on this question

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.610
and the result was indeed, a landslide.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.640
Here is Governor Jerry Brown.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.977
Those of you who are younger here

00:11:39.977 --> 00:11:42.580
and remember Governor Jerry Brown,

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.670
you don't know perhaps

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.525
that he had an earlier tour as governor

00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:48.560
when he looked a little different

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.310
than the Jerry Brown you might know.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.513
So here he is.

00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:55.629
- [Jerry] Over four million
of our fellow citizens

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:58.866
have sent a message to city hall,

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:02.490
to Sacramento, and to all of us.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.310
The message is that the property tax

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.353
must be sharply curtailed

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:10.520
and that government
spending, wherever it is,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.400
must be held in check.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.869
We must look forward to
lean and frugal budgets.

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:20.360
It's a great challenge
and we will meet it.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360
We must do everything possible

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.610
to minimize the human hardship

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.150
and maximize the total
number of state jobs

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.703
created in our economy.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.880
Proposition 13 takes place on July 1st.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.640
We have only three weeks to act,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.386
three weeks to decide

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:45.870
multi-billion dollars of fiscal questions,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.710
to set a new direction for
the 5,000 units of government

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.635
throughout our state.

00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:56.534
It's time to put aside
partisan differences,

00:12:56.534 --> 00:13:00.500
the vote represented
democrats or republicans,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.570
people from the north and the south,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.543
old and young, and all parts
of our wonderful state.

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:10.163
We must follow three basic principles.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.680
No new state taxes.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.180
Voters have told us they want a tax cut.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.170
They don't want a shell gain.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.380
Number two, the state
must share the burden.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.000
We must adopt a
thoughtful, austere budget.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.140
Already, I have imposed a hiring freeze.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.300
There will be no new hiring

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.040
and when someone leaves the state service,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.684
he or she will not be replaced.

00:13:39.684 --> 00:13:42.910
I will propose budget cuts

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.570
of at least 300 million dollars.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.570
I appeal to you to rise above
the partisan temptations

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.166
to work together as a body

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:58.166
to fashion a bill that keeps
faith with our fiscal realities

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.000
and with the mood

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.680
and the philosophy of the
people which we serve.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.140
As for business,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.690
business will reap savings

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.870
on the order of three billion dollars.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.950
Many individual businesses

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.030
will save tens of millions of dollars.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.922
These people, these corporate presidents,

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:24.660
have a moral obligation to
invest that money in California.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.290
We have a very monumental task.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.370
There is not much time.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.727
The people are waiting for us to act.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.330
- So there it was,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.520
actually the legislature
had tried to head this off

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.501
when they saw how
powerful the movement was.

00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:45.800
They came up with an
alternative called Proposition 8

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.800
which would have cut taxes
somewhat more modestly,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.670
but the victory was overwhelming.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.950
It was a 2/3 vote and Jerry Brown,

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.040
although he was a democrat,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.800
felt as you can see,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.906
compelled to go with the result

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.470
and so it wasn't challenged in court

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.890
or anything like that.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.220
They went forward.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.680
So the entrepreneur for this cause

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.540
was actually an Orange County businessman

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.790
by the name of Howard Jarvis

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.880
whose picture you saw up there.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.900
And just to get a flavor of his worldview,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.780
here was an interview with him

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.743
that was done the following day.

00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:36.610
- (mumbles) is filled
with moochers and loafers

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.410
right up to their ears.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.035
And they have a great idea.

00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:41.810
The object of the lot of them

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.400
is to get the job and sit there

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.990
until they get a paycheck.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.550
And in the meantime, they
don't move in any direction.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.540
And if you think that isn't so,

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.617
just go over there this morning
to city council's office

00:15:53.617 --> 00:15:56.960
and you walk through 15
city councilmen's office.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.540
You'll see more people
asleep and reading Playboy

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.323
than you do in a hotel.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:07.510
You've got so many consumer
protection agency in this state,

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.051
and city, and county,

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.160
that they're like a bunch
of rabbits in a field

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.420
and they multiply about as fast

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.560
and they all go into different directions

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.205
and the whole thing, it's a whole flop.

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:22.920
They know about as much
about consumer protection

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.233
as I do about swimming.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.650
This is gonna be introduced
pretty soon in Michigan,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.540
Oklahoma, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, Massachusetts,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.220
and Pennsylvania that I know about.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.900
I might say that I get calls from the BBC.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.210
I might say that I got an
invitation to go to Canada.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.170
They want to start it there.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.890
And the thing is, it's
just sweeping the country

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.130
and it's beyond my capacity
to really comprehend it

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.933
if you want to know the truth about it.

00:16:56.304 --> 00:16:58.437
- So there he was

00:16:58.437 --> 00:17:00.560
and he encapsulates this idea

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.050
that Ronald Reagan would later articulate

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.670
that government is the problem

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.590
and we have to wage a
frontal assault on it.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.880
And as he intimated with the
invitations he was getting

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.280
and the notion

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.610
that this was being
picked up in other states,

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.512
this was indeed really the starting point

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:22.591
of this anti-tax crusade

00:17:22.591 --> 00:17:26.500
that played itself out over
the next several decades

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.081
and in which we're still in the midst of.

00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:33.900
But I want to take a little step back now

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.590
and think a little bit more analytically

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.590
about the logic of what
we call these initiatives,

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:52.310
referendums, or voter
initiatives on single issues.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.162
And just to go somewhere
else for a minute,

00:17:56.162 --> 00:17:59.070
let's talk a little bit about Brexit

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.930
because I think Brexit,

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.610
there's a dimension of Brexit

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.610
that really encapsulates the
nature of referendum politics.

00:18:09.108 --> 00:18:12.440
So here's a paradox about Brexit.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.033
Britain had an election in 2015

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:19.250
and elected two parties to
the House of Parliament,

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.300
two of the two major parties.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.263
They were overwhelmingly pro-remain.

00:18:26.215 --> 00:18:29.447
2/3 of both the Labor
party elected in 2015

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.267
and the Conservative party,

00:18:32.267 --> 00:18:33.990
maybe not quite 2/3,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.850
but a very comfortable majority
of the Conservative party

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.375
were pro remaining in the European Union.

00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:46.130
David Cameron had made this promise

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.590
to have a referendum

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.380
because he was worried about UKIP,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.899
but nobody really believed

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:54.450
that the referendum was gonna come out

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.390
as it ultimately did.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.638
2016, we had this referendum

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:03.638
and the British public votes by 52 to 48

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.610
to leave the European Union

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.000
and the Brexit process begins.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.140
But here's the more puzzling question.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.180
In 2017, exactly a year
off the referendum,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.877
Britain had another general election

00:19:19.877 --> 00:19:23.400
and it elected a parliament

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.359
that was actually more pro-remain
than the 2015 parliament.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:30.984
And not only that, Theresa May,

00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:35.984
who by then had replaced David
Cameron as prime minister

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.330
who had voted for remain

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.140
but was now tasked with negotiating

00:19:45.004 --> 00:19:48.830
Britain's departure
from the European Union,

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.140
her cabinet of 24 people,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.727
17 of them were pro-remainers.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.984
So how can it be,

00:19:58.984 --> 00:20:02.473
how can it be that the British electorate

00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:06.710
on one year before this referendum

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.470
and one year after this referendum

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.710
elect a parliament and a government

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.340
that's overwhelmingly pro-remain,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.893
but nonetheless, in the
referendum, they vote to leave.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.633
Any thoughts about that?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.273
Are they schizophrenic?

00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.700
Anyone got a?

00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:33.620
We need the microphone.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.510
I've been seeing the
videos of these lectures

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.190
and nobody can hear the
questioners, so yeah.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.570
Yes, sir.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.600
Take the microphone and talk.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.413
- [Male Speaker] They vote
against their own self interest.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.540
- Well, but how does that explain?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.500
I'm not asking

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.350
whether it was in their
interest to leave or stay.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.540
Why would they vote one way in 2015,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.010
a different way in 2016,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.580
and a third way in 2017?

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.077
Yeah?

00:21:06.077 --> 00:21:07.590
- [Male Speaker] I think when
you look at a referendum--

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.990
- Take the microphone, yeah.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.790
- [Male Speaker] When we're
looking at a referendum,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.370
it's always a single issue.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.910
It's easier to vote in a single issue

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.594
and not look at the total
ramifications of that decision,

00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:21.930
whereas in an electoral campaign,

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.590
there are tons of issues that
are affecting one another

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.700
and that are on the ballot.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.540
Whereas here, I also compare

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.200
to what happened in Quebec
with the sovereignty issue.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.630
It's much easier to put on
an easy one liner question

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.900
and not think of the
ramifications of that decision.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.123
- Why is it easier?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.500
- [Male Speaker] Because you're only

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.150
taking into account facts

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.500
that are directly linked
to that one question

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.410
and you're not taking into account

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.845
the possible larger consequences

00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:54.750
of the yes or the no answer.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.430
- Okay, I think you've nailed it.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.080
So that's exactly what goes on

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.456
in that when you think
about what parties do

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:05.400
when they're putting together platforms,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.564
they have to bundle lots of issues, right?

00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:11.250
And they have to bundle them in ways

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.220
that will try and appeal
to a broad swath of voters.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.894
And so in doing that,

00:22:16.894 --> 00:22:20.740
they will discount everything they propose

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.500
by everything else they propose

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.570
to try and create

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.920
what they think is the
best overall bundle.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.670
If you're only voting on one issue,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.120
you don't have to do
that discounting, right?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.070
So just to give another example

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:41.070
which I think will help us get
back to the tax issue today.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.248
If you ask American voters in any poll

00:22:45.248 --> 00:22:48.290
would you like to get rid of a tax?

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.973
2/3 will say yes.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.310
Even the estate tax
that almost nobody pays.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.750
At least 2/3 will say yes.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.575
But if you say,

00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:00.990
and some of the subsequent polling

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.700
on the estate tax confirms this,

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.630
would you like to get
rid of the estate tax

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.180
if doing that also meant getting rid

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.120
of prescription drug
benefits for senior citizens?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.290
Then they say no.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.123
Why?

00:23:16.123 --> 00:23:17.460
Because in the second case,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.792
they're discounting their
preference for a tax cut

00:23:20.792 --> 00:23:22.760
by their preference

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.760
for losing prescription drug
benefits for seniors, right?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.660
And so what referendums with
single issue politics does

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.677
is it enables people to vote on questions

00:23:36.677 --> 00:23:39.380
without doing that discounting.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.920
So it's a little bit like having a child

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.360
eat as much candy as they want

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.430
without thinking about the stomach aches

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.623
and the doctors bills coming later.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.690
So referendum politics,

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.260
single issue voting,

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.000
it sounds terrifically democratic,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.780
let the people decide every issue,

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.080
but in fact,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.562
it's an invitation to people

00:24:03.562 --> 00:24:07.390
to engage in choosing things

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.240
without considering the costs.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.650
So in the case of California,

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.900
there would be downstream
costs on local government.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.436
That actually when we talk about next time

00:24:19.436 --> 00:24:22.100
there were gonna be downstream costs

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.480
on the California school
systems and so on.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.440
Now, you might say, well, the activists,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.720
people like Jarvis don't care about that

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.359
because their idea is starve
the beast, starve the beast,

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:39.140
but most of the people who are voting

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.340
are instead thinking
about one issue at a time.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.030
This is what I mentioned
Kahneman and Tvwersky

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.000
in connection with loss
aversion last time.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.470
Another one of their great contributions

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.700
is the idea of framing effects,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.100
that how you frame an issue

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.020
has a lot to do with what
people will say about it.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.240
So if you frame an issue saying
would you like a tax cut?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.880
Should we get rid of the estate tax?

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.850
Should we get rid of the death tax?

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.310
And everybody says,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.360
69% say yes.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.030
You can go and say 69%
of the American people

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.430
want to get rid of the death tax.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:23.430
But if you ask a question with
prescription drug benefits,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.510
then a majority says no.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.053
So what public opinion actually is,

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.100
it's not that clear, right?

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.510
It depends how you frame the choices.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.680
It depends how you frame the issue.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.590
And so when you turn tax cutting
into single issue politics,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.690
you're gonna be able to pick
up the ball and run with it

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.690
in a way that the anti-tax
movement subsequently did.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.055
And as you saw in the Norquist interview,

00:25:58.055 --> 00:26:03.055
this would become the test
for republican politicians

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:08.290
that he created this group

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.590
called Americans For Tax Reform

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.440
that we're gonna hear more
about in a few minutes

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.377
that became enormously
powerful in Washington

00:26:17.377 --> 00:26:19.700
and had meetings every Wednesday morning

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.950
and everyone who was anyone

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.467
in the lobbying world in Washington

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:27.560
had to go to those meetings.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.440
And among the things that he did

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.412
was create this pledge

00:26:32.412 --> 00:26:34.540
that he was,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.200
you could see him ambivalent

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.600
about not wanting to be seen

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.485
to criticize Ronald
Reagan on The Daily Show,

00:26:41.485 --> 00:26:45.137
but in the years subsequent to Reagan,

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:49.320
it became non-negotiable

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.467
for republicans to support tax cuts.

00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:54.770
And so you can see here.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.633
- And I'm the one who
will not raise taxes.

00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:03.230
My opponent now says he'll
raise them as a last resort

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.901
or a third resort,

00:27:04.901 --> 00:27:08.172
but when a politician talks like that,

00:27:08.172 --> 00:27:09.005
you know that's one resort
he'll be checking into.

00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:14.748
(audience applauding)

00:27:15.908 --> 00:27:16.908
My opponent,

00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:21.092
my opponent won't rule out raising taxes.

00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:24.888
But I will and the congress
will push me to raise taxes

00:27:24.888 --> 00:27:25.899
and I'll say no.

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.470
And they'll push and I'll say no.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.170
And they'll push again

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.870
and I'll say to them,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.573
"Read my lips, no new taxes."

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.957
(audience applauding)

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:57.759
- And that became the instrument
of his undoing in 1991

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.920
when off the Gulf War,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.490
he was at the 99% popularity rating.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.490
The country was in a pretty
significant fiscal crisis

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.190
and he did indeed raise taxes.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:20.190
And that caused the anti-tax
movement to turn on him

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.590
led by Newt Gingrich who was at that time,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:29.543
the leader of the republican
minority in congress.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.480
But it was Gingrich on
this anti-tax platform

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.600
who was to orchestrate
the republican take over

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.380
of the House of Representatives in 1994.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.410
And Gingrich declared open war

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.270
on George Herbert Walker Bush

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.600
as a traitor to the anti-tax cause

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.230
and is widely believed by consultants

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.140
to have been a major factor

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.460
in his defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.870
that he was so badly damaged.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.680
And Gingrich who would then
become the house speaker

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.440
had something called a
contract with America

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.580
which was essentially the manifesto

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.000
of the anti new deal coalition on taxes.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.300
It was going to require 2/3 votes

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.460
in both houses to raise taxes.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.540
Every republican was now required

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.690
to sign the anti-tax pledge,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.950
pledging that you wouldn't raise taxes.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.410
And it really was quite stunning

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.580
when you think about the
sweep of American history

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.580
that from 1932 until 1994,

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:58.360
congress had been controlled by,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.529
the house had been controlled by democrats

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:05.310
for all but four of those 62 years,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.670
58 years,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.660
and the senate had been
controlled by democrats

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.030
for all but 10 of those 62 years.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:18.030
So the democrats believed they were

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.846
the natural party of government

00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:25.846
and seemed to be the
natural party of government.

00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:30.550
You see the presidents
are in the middle there.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.770
So you can see from time to time,

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.160
there were republican presidents,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.330
but they basically had to govern
with democratic congresses.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.350
Now, if you look at what 1994 ushers in,

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.870
it's a completely different world.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:49.870
The republicans control the
house for much of that time,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.433
all but six years from then until now

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.150
and they control the senate also

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.330
for the bulk of the time.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.850
So this really is,

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.010
1994 is a pivot point.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.700
It is a sea change.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.550
And the glue that held
this crusade together

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.773
was the anti-tax movement.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.115
And I want to now zero in

00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:17.480
on the repeal of the estate tax

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.610
because as I said at the beginning,

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.147
this is a tax that almost nobody paid.

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:26.750
It was the most
progressive tax in the code

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:31.750
and yet it was repealed with
substantial bipartisan support.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.803
So here's candidate Bush
running for election

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.633
and listen to him on the estate tax.

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:45.235
- I will use this moment of opportunity

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:50.090
to bring common sense and
fairness to the tax code

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.330
and I will act on principle,

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.810
on principle,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.810
every family, every farmer
and small business person

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.200
should be free to pass on

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.400
their life's work to those they love,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.358
so we will abolish the death tax.

00:32:04.358 --> 00:32:07.525
(audience applauding)

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.410
- And interestingly,

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:30.410
when you interview the
people who ran that campaign,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.520
they said they were actually surprised

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.570
that he got these vast applause lines

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.410
for saying he'll abolish the death tax.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.880
Now, calling it the death tax,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.100
that was one of Frank
Luntz's ideas actually.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.710
It's sometimes attributed to Norquist,

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.625
but the truth is calling it the death tax

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:55.625
increases the support from mid 60's

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.586
to around 70% saying yes, get rid of it.

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:00.850
It's not that big of a difference,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.010
but obviously,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.761
they decided that it
had a certain ring to it

00:33:05.761 --> 00:33:09.810
and that why should you
stop off at the tax man

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.543
on the way to the undertaker?

00:33:12.543 --> 00:33:14.510
And much of the argument

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.778
was arguments about small businesses,

00:33:18.778 --> 00:33:22.930
the vast majority of which
didn't pay estate taxes.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.010
We'll come back to that.

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.900
And then there were other arguments made

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.260
like it's double taxation.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.590
People have already earned the money

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.200
and paid taxes on it.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.023
Why should they pay taxes on it again?

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.340
But of course, the tax
code is filled with double,

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.550
triple, quadruple, and quintuple taxation.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.182
Sales taxes are taxes on,

00:33:47.182 --> 00:33:49.690
you're paying taxes again on money

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.391
that you paid taxes on before.

00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:57.350
So no more double taxation

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.340
than many other taxes in the code,

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.286
but they were surprised

00:34:01.286 --> 00:34:04.565
at how much resonance this got.

00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:08.863
Indeed, if you look at the
contract form with America,

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.767
at that time, the threshold below which

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:17.767
you didn't have to pay
estate taxes was $675,000.

00:34:19.294 --> 00:34:23.600
And all they proposed was
putting it up a little bit,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.583
putting the threshold up a little bit.

00:34:26.825 --> 00:34:31.825
They didn't think that they
could really get rid of this tax

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.080
because they thought

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.363
how would you get the coalition to do it?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.600
Nonetheless, in June of 2001,

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.410
George W. Bush signed the Economic Growth

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:53.060
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.040
I'm gonna talk a little bit

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.265
about why it was called
reconciliation in a little while.

00:34:58.265 --> 00:35:02.670
And it was one of the principle
components of that act

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:06.180
that it was gonna get
rid of the estate tax.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.540
And just to give a sense
of proportionality here,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:14.540
this was a bill that was gonna
cost 1.3 trillion dollars

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.470
over the next decade in
terms of lost revenues.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.303
And as you can see,

00:35:20.303 --> 00:35:21.910
the bulk of it came

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.910
from almost half of a billion
dollars of income taxes,

00:35:27.845 --> 00:35:30.330
but then the other major pieces

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.900
were a big increase in child tax credits

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.710
and the estate tax

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:41.780
and getting rid of the
so-called marriage penalty.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.163
So it's gonna cost the federal government.

00:35:46.163 --> 00:35:50.210
It's not chump change in 2001 dollars.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.970
It was gonna cost the federal government

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:56.847
138 billion dollars over 10
years to repeal this tax.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.310
And a couple of other things

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:02.883
worth pointing out about the repeal.

00:36:09.424 --> 00:36:11.110
In the American system,

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.100
in order to pass a bill in the senate,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.430
you need 60 votes

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.403
because the minority can filibuster

00:36:18.403 --> 00:36:19.760
with 100 senators

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.330
but the minority can filibuster a bill

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.640
and you can only end a
filibuster if you have 60 votes.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.220
And the republicans didn't
have 60 votes in the senate.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.440
And although they had some democrats

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.000
who were willing to support this,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.303
in the end,

00:36:34.303 --> 00:36:37.440
they had eight senate democrats
ended up supporting this,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.010
they didn't have 60 votes

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.530
and they knew they weren't
gonna have 60 votes.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.830
And so the way that you got around this,

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.062
this is why it was called

00:36:47.062 --> 00:36:51.500
the word reconciliation
appears in the title,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.320
was the so-called procedure
of budget reconciliation

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.240
which President Trump used again in 2017

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.460
to get his tax bill through.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.870
And the good news about reconciliation

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.690
if you're trying to pass a bill

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.360
is you only need a majority.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.120
So you only need 50 votes

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.650
because the vice president
breaks ties in the senate.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.007
So you get 50 votes,
you've got 51 out of 100.

00:37:19.007 --> 00:37:20.760
That's the good news.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.260
The bad news is that if you do something

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.270
through the budget reconciliation process,

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:32.540
it has to balance over a 10 year period.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:37.540
And so the problem was how
to do a massive tax cut

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.820
and have the budget balance over 10 years.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.767
And in those days,

00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:49.670
the congressional budget office

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.763
that scores this legislation,

00:37:55.608 --> 00:37:57.050
it was as it still is,

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.440
it's manned by career professionals

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.238
who use their own methods
for scoring bills.

00:38:03.238 --> 00:38:05.220
And there was a big fight

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.100
which has since been lost by the CBO

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.340
as to whether or not to use

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.620
so-called dynamic scoring of bills.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.870
So dynamic scoring of bills
is informed by the idea,

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:21.870
well, what effect will these
tax cuts have on the economy?

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.760
Because it's a standard
belief among republicans

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.240
that if you cut taxes,

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.350
you'll get more growth,

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:30.979
you'll get more revenue,

00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:33.340
and so there will be a dynamic effect.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.340
And these theories are
always controversial

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.186
and we'll see the predictions of the 2017,

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:46.125
the dynamic predictions
behind the 2017 act

00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:51.125
have gone the way of
other dynamic predictions.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.490
But in any event, the
CBO refused to do this.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.750
They refused to do at
that time dynamic scoring.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.850
This is now changed.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.683
It tells you something

00:39:00.683 --> 00:39:03.500
about how far the goal posts have shifted.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.400
CBO will do dynamic scoring of bills.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.990
So the numbers,

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.960
you couldn't do fuzzy math

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.350
as George W. Bush used to call it.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.220
The CBO did the math
and it had to balance.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.730
And so the way they got around this

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.320
as you can see from here

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.710
is that they phased it in.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.630
So they phased it in over 10 years

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.910
and so what they did

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.150
was they gradually raised the exemption.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.865
As I said, it had been $675,000

00:39:36.865 --> 00:39:39.813
to a million dollars in 2002.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.900
You have to double all these
numbers for a married couple,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.590
so two million for a married couple.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.880
And they gradually increased the exemption

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.980
to 2009 to 3,500.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.380
They had to repeal.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.190
They repealed the bill,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.790
the tax completely in 2010,

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.802
and then worse if it was not extended,

00:40:03.802 --> 00:40:06.590
it was gonna come back in 2011

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.620
as it would have gone back to 675,000.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.980
So some people call this bill

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.630
the push granny off the bus in 2010 bill

00:40:22.597 --> 00:40:25.106
because if you died in 2010

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:27.930
as George Steinbrenner

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.680
who was the owner of the New York Yankees

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.830
had the good fortune to die in 2010,

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:36.170
or his children had the good
fortune that he died in 2010.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:37.960
There was no estate tax.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.650
But if you died in 2011,

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.370
there was gonna be an estate tax again

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:48.370
at a 56% rate with a $675,000 threshold.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.740
So you don't have to worry
about the rest of it,

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.461
but so you can see they gradually
brought the tax rate down

00:41:01.461 --> 00:41:04.020
but it would have gone back up.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.350
So it's a kind of bizarre
piece of legislation

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:11.970
because nevermind throwing
granny off the bus,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.710
people don't know when they're gonna die

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.290
so how do you prepare?

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.530
How do you do tax planning?

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:22.530
Should you be buying insurance
with respect to covering

00:41:23.602 --> 00:41:28.602
what you may or may not have
to pay out of your estate?

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.481
So they were basically banking on the idea

00:41:32.481 --> 00:41:37.130
that these tax cuts would be extended.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.095
And by the way, this was true.

00:41:39.095 --> 00:41:41.350
The whole bill.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.150
I'm just focusing now on
the estate tax piece of it,

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.710
but the whole bill would
have to be extended

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.190
because if it had been
(mumbles) by reconciliation.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.630
So essentially, it was a tax cut

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.480
with a sunset clause

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.650
where the default of doing nothing

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:02.513
would be to repeal the cuts
in 10 years down the road.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.820
In politics, one year is 1,000 lifetimes.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.360
10 years, who knows what's gonna
be going on 10 years later?

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.940
So that was the estate tax repeal

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.340
and they felt they had
to get a full repeal

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.500
because that was part
of their rallying cry.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.150
Get rid of the death tax

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:27.150
even if it was only guaranteed
initially for the year 2010.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.230
So how was it done?

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.870
As I said, almost nobody paid this tax.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.030
How did they put together
a coalition to do it?

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.730
And it had to be a diverse coalition.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.960
So let's just listen again
to our friend Grover.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.350
- [Grover] When Reagan came to Washington,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.070
he was almost the only Reaganite in town.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.740
When George W. Bush came in,

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.850
there was a town full of Reaganites

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.750
at the airport greeting him.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.700
And when he says, "I
think we oughta do X,"

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.860
there are institutions and newsletters,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.080
and magazines, and think tanks,

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.777
and whole trade associations that go,

00:43:04.777 --> 00:43:07.400
"Boy, yes," and we have that written up.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.620
- [Host] The people at Grover Norquist's

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.240
Wednesday meetings all
have different interests,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.340
but the glue that holds this
coalition together is tax cuts.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.500
Norquist has been toiling away
for tax cuts for a long time.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.930
He invented the no new taxes pledge

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.120
that's now considered
a political requirement

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.450
for candidates in many
parts of the country.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.970
He helped mastermind Newt
Gingrich's contract with America

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.530
and he helped popularize

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.420
the republican's new
name for the estate tax,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.735
the death tax.

00:43:34.735 --> 00:43:36.207
- [Stephen] When you think
about Grover's influence

00:43:36.207 --> 00:43:38.340
on the conservative movement,

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.480
you would really have to say

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.030
that Grover Norquist is the
Ralph Nader of the right.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.177
- [Host] Stephen Moore is the President

00:43:45.177 --> 00:43:46.730
of the Club for Growth

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.090
which supports conservative
republican candidates

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.610
in primary challenges
against other republicans

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.530
it considers too moderate.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.040
- [Stephen] Right often fails

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.171
because we tend to find ourselves
in circular firing squads.

00:43:59.171 --> 00:44:02.350
And what Grover says quite
correctly is look folks,

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.820
at least if we're gonna be
in a circular firing squad,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.830
let's put Dick Gephardt in the middle.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.700
And that's the kind of
tactician that he is.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.717
- [Grover] One of the signs
of maturity on the right

00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:16.220
is that you don't ask a
president to win votes

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.600
that's not there.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.370
My job is to get the death
tax ready for repeal,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.400
to have the votes in the
house and senate for repeal,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.420
and to make the world safe

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.350
for a president to cheerfully sign it

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.440
so that he's proud and happy to sign it.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.800
It's a political winner
for him to sign it.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.870
The central question in American politics

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.803
is the size of government.

00:44:34.803 --> 00:44:36.800
It's gonna get bigger or smaller.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.510
Of the resources that you
and your family put together,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.000
more of it go to the state
or more of it stay with you.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.500
- [Host] When the tax cut is enacted,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.930
Grover Norquist says,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.880
there will be much less money
available to the government,

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.020
fewer resources that the state can use

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.570
to bother the members
of what Norquist calls

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.920
the leave us alone coalition.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.990
Grover Norquist's long term
goal is simple and very radical.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.290
He wants to cut the size
of government in half

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.210
over the next 25 years.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.700
That's a serious and
reasonable goal, he says,

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.470
and one he's willing to advance

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.040
with as blunt a metaphor as possible.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.770
- [Grover] I don't want
to abolish government.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.540
I simply want to reduce it to the size

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.500
where I could drag it into the bathroom

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.900
and drown it in the bathtub.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.910
- Shrink government to the size

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.690
where you can drown it in the bathtub,

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:30.240
and this became a famous phrase of his.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.240
So he saw it as his job to
work with the groups outside

00:45:36.749 --> 00:45:39.870
and put together the coalition to do this.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.570
And one of the things you can
do with single issue politics

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.220
is you can get all kinds of people

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.656
who wouldn't agree on anything else,

00:45:48.656 --> 00:45:50.660
but will agree on this.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.923
And so this is what was done

00:45:52.923 --> 00:45:55.649
to create the coalition

00:45:55.649 --> 00:45:59.460
to get rid of the estate tax.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.330
Just to talk about a few people
who were important players.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.200
This is Frank Blethen,

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.170
the owner of The Seattle Times,

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.173
a political liberal,

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.060
and he poured a huge amount of effort

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.060
and energy into this campaign
to get rid of the estate tax.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.130
Why?

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:27.130
Because he saw that the
family owned newspapers

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:31.650
were being gobbled up by the
big corporate conglomerates,

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:33.490
Gannett, and so forth.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.522
And he thought that if
family owned newspapers

00:46:36.522 --> 00:46:40.540
couldn't be passed on
to his next generation,

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.381
it was gonna accelerate this process

00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:51.246
of getting rid of family owned newspapers.

00:46:51.246 --> 00:46:56.246
Bob Johnson, founder of Black
Entertainment Television.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:01.693
He was on the liberal democrat.

00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:04.850
Gave a lot of money to liberal democrats

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.256
and interestingly when
the momentum was building

00:47:09.256 --> 00:47:13.123
to repeal the estate tax,

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.080
Bill Gates and a few other millionaires

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.661
published a letter in The New York Times

00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:23.344
and The Wall Street Journal
and The Washington Post

00:47:23.344 --> 00:47:26.886
saying, "No, we should
keep the estate tax."

00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:31.886
And they had about 20 or
30 wealthy individuals

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.450
who signed up for this.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.450
And Johnson was so angry

00:47:39.913 --> 00:47:43.710
that he ran a counter ad

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:47.518
and he got a counter ad

00:47:47.518 --> 00:47:50.570
calling for the repeal of the estate tax.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.560
And I went and interviewed him about that

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.550
and I said, "Why did you do that?"

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.807
And he said, "Well, doesn't matter to me.

00:47:58.807 --> 00:48:00.595
"I'm gonna be dead,

00:48:00.595 --> 00:48:04.297
"but for the first time
in American history,

00:48:04.297 --> 00:48:06.817
"we have African American millionaires

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.887
"and some African American billionaires.

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.747
"If they have to sell their businesses

00:48:12.747 --> 00:48:15.917
"to pay the estate tax,

00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:16.750
"do you think that money

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.407
"is gonna be reinvested
in the Black community?

00:48:19.407 --> 00:48:20.397
"I don't."

00:48:23.174 --> 00:48:24.330
Then he said, you know,

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.500
if you could exempt African Americans

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.370
from paying the tax for 50 years,

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.100
I might think differently,

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:35.040
but when we finally get some
wealthy African Americans,

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.853
this is the time when we're
gonna get rid of the estate tax?

00:48:38.853 --> 00:48:40.480
I don't think so.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.127
And then he said, "And besides,

00:48:43.127 --> 00:48:44.437
"Gates didn't call me.

00:48:44.437 --> 00:48:45.270
"He didn't call Oprah.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.510
"Who does he think he is?"

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.980
So part of it was personal.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.980
But basically, he had a
story that he told himself

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.650
about why this was actually
bad for African Americans.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.323
Congressman Albert Wynn,

00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:08.440
one of the strange things about this

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.226
was the White House,

00:49:11.226 --> 00:49:12.260
not the White House,

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.070
the democratic leadership on the hill

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:20.070
were stunned that the
Congressional Black Caucus

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.700
came out in favor of getting
rid of the estate tax.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.990
And when I interviewed Albert Wynn

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.100
about why did you get,

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.176
he was Maryland's fourth district,

00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:33.010
somewhat centrist,

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.380
but certainly not a conservative democrat.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.273
Why did you support it?

00:49:40.358 --> 00:49:44.843
He said, "Well, we have lots
of small business in Maryland.

00:49:46.227 --> 00:49:48.667
"My district has got
the 10th largest number

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:51.037
"of small businesses in America

00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:53.007
"and I was getting a lot of pressure

00:49:53.007 --> 00:49:56.890
"from small business
constituents to support this."

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.590
He didn't see any cost.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:02.094
And I think the interview with him

00:50:02.094 --> 00:50:05.760
was very revealing on
this point about bundling

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.760
because what the coalition
to get this done would do

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:16.530
is they would run all of
these single issue polls,

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.960
getting polls to get people to say

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.380
they want to repeal the death tax,

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.470
and then they would go into
congress congressional offices

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.030
and say to the congressmen,

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.167
or the congresswomen, or the senator,

00:50:30.167 --> 00:50:34.377
"Look, this huge support for this.

00:50:34.377 --> 00:50:37.767
"You're not gonna lose
your seat over this.

00:50:37.767 --> 00:50:39.657
"This is not a voting issue

00:50:39.657 --> 00:50:42.407
"for most people in a general election,

00:50:42.407 --> 00:50:44.433
"so it's a free vote.

00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:47.817
"It's a free vote to vote for it,

00:50:47.817 --> 00:50:50.947
"but it might not be a free
vote to vote against it

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:53.487
"because if you vote against it,

00:50:53.487 --> 00:50:56.410
"we could make your life difficult."

00:50:56.410 --> 00:51:00.783
So for instance, Senator
Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas,

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:06.410
a centrist democrat,

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.940
she voted for this repeal

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.920
and you interview her staff basically.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.650
They said she hated this,

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.910
but here it is, it's a
free vote if you do it.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.890
If you don't, who lives in Arkansas?

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:24.870
Well, the Walton family
live in Arkansas of Walmart.

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:29.650
And the Walton family can
make any sitting senator

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:33.520
from Arkansas' life very
difficult if they want to.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.520
And so why infuriate one of the most,

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.000
the wealthiest,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.640
probably the wealthiest
family in your state

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.330
over a vote that's not gonna
cost you anything electorally

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.060
if you go the other way.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:52.590
So a lot of these people
felt that sort of pressure

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:54.000
on the one side

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.450
and didn't see any cost on the other.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.570
Neil Abercrombie,

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:01.360
the only congressman
from Hawaii at that time.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.270
He's since been a three term governor.

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:06.770
A liberal democrat, he supported it.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.180
A great puzzle to me.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.610
A very, very liberal democrat he was,

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.978
at least at that time.

00:52:13.978 --> 00:52:16.276
When I went to interview him,

00:52:16.276 --> 00:52:19.180
I got a big part of the answer

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:22.570
which was that his office

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.923
was right next door to the office

00:52:25.923 --> 00:52:30.923
of the principle supporter of the bill

00:52:31.177 --> 00:52:33.790
and her name was Jennifer Dunn,

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:38.790
a very smart republican
congresswoman also from the west

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.470
and since deceased,

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:46.270
but her office was next door to his

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:48.620
and she went to work on him

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.020
and found out what he
needed in his district.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.270
And so it did things for
him and it was personal.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.503
He didn't see why he
shouldn't support her.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.170
Again, there was not gonna
be any electoral cost.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.140
So there were these kind of people

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.940
and then there were arguments like

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.560
we didn't have gay marriage
at that time, as you know.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.393
This is 2001.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.400
And so gay groups came out
in support of the repeal

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.740
on the grounds

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.140
that the estate tax
discriminates against gay people

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.470
because if you're a
heterosexual married couple,

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:27.840
you could double the exemption,

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.960
but gay people couldn't
double the exemption.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.970
So that's unfair to gay people.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.600
So gay groups came out in support of it.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.540
So it's a very cleverly
orchestrated coalition

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.950
of very strange bedfellows

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:44.970
that nonetheless could be
brought either to support this

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.773
or not to oppose it.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.660
And then when you think
about the opposition,

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.320
the opposition to this bill.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.500
First of all,

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.980
one thing to say about it is

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.830
that they really didn't take it seriously

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:03.530
until it was a long way toward happening.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:05.170
They didn't take it seriously

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:09.120
because they thought it would
be electorally unpopular

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:14.120
and the republicans had been
voting this up in the house

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.380
in the last years of the
Clinton Administration

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.020
and the senate

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.790
and there was always the security

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.920
that President Clinton would
veto it anyway if it passed,

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.700
but they didn't take it that
seriously until it was done.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.050
But where was the opposition?

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:36.830
Where was organized labor?

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.730
Well, we know from the last lecture,

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:44.598
organized labor by this point
is so far back on its heels

00:54:44.598 --> 00:54:49.202
that they don't really
care about tax issues.

00:54:49.202 --> 00:54:53.840
I interviewed the lobbyist
for the AFL-CIO in Washington

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.847
and basically what he said was,

00:54:56.847 --> 00:55:01.057
"We have four lobbyists in Washington now.

00:55:01.057 --> 00:55:03.797
"One of them spends a quarter of his time

00:55:03.797 --> 00:55:05.920
"on all tax issues."

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.856
He couldn't even remember
what had been at stake.

00:55:08.856 --> 00:55:13.020
So it's a kind of thing that
three or four decades earlier,

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:16.400
organized labor would have
been very active against,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.820
but they were much more involved

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.920
in other issues at this time

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.920
like getting the NLRB to be more friendly

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.137
to card check and systems of organizing

00:55:31.137 --> 00:55:34.370
that might help reverse their decline.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:37.300
This just was not an issue for them.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.000
Non-profit groups,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.400
non-profit groups,

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.230
Yale gets hundreds of
millions of dollars every year

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.550
partly because people want
to avoid estate taxes.

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:49.810
They don't want to give
it to the government,

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.190
so they give it to Yale.

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:56.473
But the difficulty is it's
very difficult to say,

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.180
well, we should have a tax

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.720
so that you'll have an
incentive to avoid the tax

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.145
in order to give it to us.

00:56:06.145 --> 00:56:10.803
It's not an easy argument to make.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.150
Insurance industry.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.947
There were at least four
big insurance companies

00:56:15.947 --> 00:56:20.000
that stood to lose a huge amount from this

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.040
because there are people who buy

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.133
tax planning insurance from them.

00:56:25.913 --> 00:56:29.730
I interviewed one of their lobbyists

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:30.947
and they said, "Well,

00:56:30.947 --> 00:56:32.977
"we're a very republican industry.

00:56:32.977 --> 00:56:37.207
"It's very difficult for
us to oppose any tax cut,

00:56:37.207 --> 00:56:42.030
"and besides, we knew President
Clinton would veto this."

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.190
And I said, "Well, but there
was an election coming up,"

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:47.260
and they said, "Well, we
thought Gore would win."

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.894
And I said, "And you sell insurance?"

00:56:49.894 --> 00:56:51.700
(audience laughing)

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.610
So the insurance industry
was largely mute.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:59.130
And then what about liberal democrats?

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:01.290
At best, they were split.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:06.290
So you had this campaign which
was extremely well organized,

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.000
well resourced.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
It was funded by a tax planner
called Patricia Saldarno.

00:57:14.785 --> 00:57:17.210
She was a tax planner

00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:19.490
who worked for very wealthy individuals

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.650
and she came to Washington once a month

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:26.663
and spent a week meeting
with the coalition groups.

00:57:26.663 --> 00:57:30.350
It had very smart strategy and leadership.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:35.097
And particularly in managing
conflicts within the coalition

00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:38.060
because there were conflicts of interest.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:41.340
You can tell that there
must have been conflicts

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.720
from the divided dollar game

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.212
that we have talked about already.

00:57:45.212 --> 00:57:50.212
For example, the rates
versus the threshold.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.743
Huge conflict because if
you're a small business,

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:58.060
you're gonna have an estate worth seven

00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.610
or eight million dollars,

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:02.640
whether the threshold
is two million dollars

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.890
or four million dollars is huge, right,

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.828
because if you're married,

00:58:08.828 --> 00:58:11.220
the four million dollar threshold

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.300
is gonna be eight million dollars.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.060
You might not pay anything at all.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.553
So for small businesses,

00:58:15.553 --> 00:58:20.553
it's all about the threshold.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:22.513
If you're a billionaire,

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:25.730
whether the threshold is two million

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:28.010
or four million is chump change.

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.520
What matters to you is the rate, right?

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.320
If it's 56% or 40%,

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.050
there's hundreds of millions
of dollars at stake for you,

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:36.883
right?

00:58:36.883 --> 00:58:38.980
So there are plenty of sources

00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.431
of potential conflict
within the coalition.

00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:47.123
Another one is farmers
versus small businesses.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.930
So they needed the small businesses

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.030
to get it through the house

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.190
and they needed to farmers
to get it through the senate

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.623
because the senate,

00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.600
farm states are massively
overrepresented in the senate.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.543
And of course, when the
democrats finally realized,

00:59:06.859 --> 00:59:11.859
when the democrats finally
realized that this was serious,

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:14.610
they tried to split the coalition.

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:16.800
They tried to do exactly what you would do

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.000
if you understand the divided dollar game.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.630
They came and offered the farmers

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:23.920
an immediate permanent exemption

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.490
which is better than they
were gonna get in the bill

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.323
'cause the bill,

00:59:28.323 --> 00:59:30.130
we saw there's a phase in

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.340
and then it sunsets in 2010

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.630
and who knows what's gonna
be the case after that?

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:40.653
So the democrats offered
the farmers a better deal.

00:59:40.653 --> 00:59:43.860
You have a permanent
exemption from the estate tax.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.464
Now, they were trying to
split them off the coalition

00:59:47.464 --> 00:59:51.441
and some of the most difficult meetings

00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:55.873
of the coalition were over
these sorts of fights.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:01.168
I interviewed a number of
the members of this coalition

01:00:01.168 --> 01:00:04.210
and they gave two answers

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.750
as to how they held it together

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:08.150
and it was very interesting.

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.083
One was they said,

01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:16.730
I must have interviewed
maybe 15 or 20 people

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.160
who had been in this coalition

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.110
over a period of three or four months.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:24.990
And so at least five or six of them said,

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.840
well, there were all these possibilities,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.840
but we realized that
if we got off the idea

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.620
of total repeal for at least one year,

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.823
total repeal,

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.330
which would then generate all the math

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.430
to squash in the rates

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:50.486
and the thresholds to get to total repeal

01:00:50.486 --> 01:00:52.512
within the 10 year window

01:00:52.512 --> 01:00:55.810
and meet the budget reconciliation target,

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:58.863
if we got off the idea of total repeal,

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.550
we wouldn't know what we could agree on.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:05.860
We knew we wouldn't be able
to agree on anything else.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.130
And so it was as if they intuited

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.040
the logic of the divided dollar game

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.090
and that total repeal,
we can all get behind.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:13.923
We can rally it.

01:01:13.923 --> 01:01:15.410
We've gotta repeal the death tax.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.120
We've gotta repeal the death tax.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.120
Once we get into other kinds
of formulations of the problem,

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.160
they sensed the whole
thing would fall apart.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.060
So the rallying cry of total
repeal was hugely important.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:33.844
But it wasn't just that,

01:01:33.844 --> 01:01:38.844
but it was also that they had
a kind of moral narrative.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.100
So we're now in the realm of ideas,

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.750
ideologies, right?

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.370
Not just interests, ideologies.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.480
They had this idea

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.530
that this is a morally repugnant tax.

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:55.410
You're taxing people for dying

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:58.520
and they've been taxed
before and it's wrong.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.747
And multiple people I interviewed

01:02:01.747 --> 01:02:04.770
including I interviewed
some of these farmers

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.260
who were in the coalition.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:10.200
I said here, you were actually
being offered a better deal,

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.130
a predictable immediate
exemption from the estate tax,

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.060
permanent.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.180
Why wouldn't you take it?

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.953
And they said things
like this is a crusade.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.670
This is a moral cause.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.675
How could I look at myself in the mirror

01:02:26.675 --> 01:02:29.460
and know I had been bought off?

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.899
How could I tell my children

01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:34.084
that I had sold out on this movement

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:39.084
because we had been offered a better deal?

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.560
And so there was this moral narrative

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.000
that they used as a kind
of way of heading off

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
the splintering potential
of divide a dollar.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:51.910
And this narrative, by the way,

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:54.180
was not just used in the coalition.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.870
They used it in congress.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.030
They brought people to testify

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:01.910
with horrific stories about how

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.280
a family that had died

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.990
and had had to pay the estate
tax had had to sell things.

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:13.866
And they brought famously

01:03:13.866 --> 01:03:16.480
a tree farmer from Mississippi

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.310
called Chester Thigpen to testify

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:22.430
before the House Ways and Means Committee.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.590
And Chester, you can
read his testimony there.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:27.657
He says, "It took us half a century,

01:03:27.657 --> 01:03:30.367
"but Rosett and I have
managed to turn our land

01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:31.847
"into a working tree farm

01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:33.337
"that has been a source of pride

01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:35.837
"and income for my entire family.

01:03:35.837 --> 01:03:37.447
"Our tree farm made it possible

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.677
"to put our five children through college.

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:41.687
"It made us possible to leave a legacy

01:03:41.687 --> 01:03:43.437
"that makes me very proud

01:03:43.437 --> 01:03:45.227
"because forests and ponds

01:03:45.227 --> 01:03:47.437
"that can live on for many, many years

01:03:47.437 --> 01:03:49.517
"after my wife and I pass on.

01:03:49.517 --> 01:03:52.287
"We also want to leave the
tree farm in our family.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.977
"Right now, people tell me my tree farm

01:03:54.977 --> 01:03:57.207
"could be worth more
than a million dollars.

01:03:57.207 --> 01:04:00.387
"All that value's tied
up in land or trees.

01:04:00.387 --> 01:04:01.517
"We're not rich people.

01:04:01.517 --> 01:04:05.147
"My son and I do almost all
the work on our land ourselves,

01:04:05.147 --> 01:04:08.257
"but my children might have
to break up the tree farm

01:04:08.257 --> 01:04:13.090
"or sell off timber to pay
the estate taxes when I die."

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.670
He actually, he died the next year

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:16.853
and he didn't owe any estate tax,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.800
but Chester Thigpen, there
was Chester, you know?

01:04:23.172 --> 01:04:26.507
And so this was the
moral face of the repeal

01:04:26.507 --> 01:04:28.900
and the ideas were important

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.060
in sustaining this coalition

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:36.060
as I said of heading off
the impulse to break it.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.990
So let's just now zoom out a little bit

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:43.770
and talk about tax cuts and
the republican coalition

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.390
and why this social movement
as I'm saying is so important.

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:50.460
And it's one of the recurring phrases

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:54.060
you hear from consultants
and academics alike

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.340
is that tax cuts are the one issue

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:01.490
that unites the entire republican party.

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:02.860
And if you think about this,

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.270
I'm gonna just put a little flesh on this.

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:10.270
I said that when we think
about the median voter

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.780
and so forth,

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.800
one reason why people don't vote

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.590
as the median voter says they should

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:21.580
could be that there's a
second dimension like race,

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.413
right?

01:05:22.413 --> 01:05:23.580
Remember when I put the,

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.350
I had the second dimension up.

01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:29.360
So the tax cutting,

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.010
it might seem not to be about money,

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:36.220
but listen to Lee Atwater
on this topic of tax cuts.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.210
Lee Atwater was a republican strategist

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:42.083
who worked in the Reagan White House.

01:05:43.305 --> 01:05:46.055
(static buzzing)

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.810
- [Lee] Here's how I
would approach that issue

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:08.170
as a statistician for political science,

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:11.230
or no, as a psychologist, which I'm not,

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:16.145
is how abstract you handle the race thing.

01:06:16.145 --> 01:06:17.881
In other words, you start out

01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:19.670
and now y'all are gonna quote me on this.

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.460
All right, I won't do it.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.130
You start out in 1954,

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:25.300
by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger."

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.280
By 1968, you can't say nigger.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.113
That hurts you.

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:31.800
It backfires, so you say
stuff like forced busing,

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.860
state's rights and all that stuff.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.170
And you're getting so abstract now,

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:38.650
you're talking about cutting taxes

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:40.220
and all of these things
you're talking about

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.560
are totally economic things.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.150
And the byproduct driving the media

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:46.010
is blacks get hurt worse than whites.

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:48.580
And subconsciously,
maybe that is part of it.

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.413
I'm not saying that,

01:06:49.413 --> 01:06:52.630
but I'm saying that if it
is getting that abstract

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:53.685
and that coded

01:06:53.685 --> 01:06:56.560
that we're doing away
with the racial problem

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.900
one way for the other.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.300
You following me?

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.650
'Cause obviously sitting around

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.460
saying we want to cut taxes,

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.160
we want to cut this,

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.310
is much more abstract
than even the busing thing

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.000
and a hell of a lot more
abstract than nigger, nigger,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
you know?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.970
So any way you look at it,

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:17.703
race is coming on the back burner.

01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:25.043
- So that's a pretty candid
admission of the proposition

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.830
which the Edsel and Edsel
book on the syllabus

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:33.130
which became actually a
kind of almost a manifesto

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:38.000
for the 1992 Clinton
campaign makes explicitly,

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:44.170
namely that the tax cutting agenda

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:48.530
is linked to the racial agenda

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:52.200
because the notion that's pushed

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.210
as in Ronald Reagan's
welfare queens speech,

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:58.010
the notion that is pushed

01:07:58.010 --> 01:08:03.010
is that most of this money is
spent on the undeserving poor

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:09.140
and probably undeserving
poor who are not white.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.160
And we'll come back to this later

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.030
when we talk about the kind of resentment

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:20.030
that people like (mumbles)
found in Louisiana

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:27.100
when she spent a lot of time
with poor white voters there.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.007
So the tax cutting agenda

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:36.000
is not an alternative to
the southern strategy,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.380
but actually becomes an expression of it.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.970
And then the second thing
about the tax cutting agenda

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:48.970
is that it heads off
the divide a dollar game

01:08:49.606 --> 01:08:52.970
by giving something to everybody.

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:56.722
So what's interesting about the
Bush tax cut as you can see,

01:08:56.722 --> 01:08:59.740
you can look through these at your leisure

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.010
when I post the slides,

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.860
but the take away point is
that everybody got a tax cut.

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.923
Every rate was cut.

01:09:08.485 --> 01:09:13.379
So that is quite remarkable.

01:09:13.379 --> 01:09:16.830
It's a way of saying
we don't have to worry

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:18.990
about who's gonna split the coalition.

01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:21.613
Everybody's getting a tax cut, right?

01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:24.520
When you framed the issue that way,

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.323
it tends to take the
divided dollar problem away.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.920
So how far have the goal posts shifted?

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.983
Well, in 2010,

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.420
President Obama was now president

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:43.240
and the country was still in recession

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.140
after the financial crisis

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.140
and the democrats controlled

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.190
the whole of congress at that time,

01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:55.170
but it was very, very broad consensus

01:09:55.170 --> 01:10:00.170
that if you put in a tax increase

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.890
in the middle of this recession,

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:02.850
it was gonna be bad.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:07.565
So they extended the tax
cuts for two years to 2012,

01:10:07.565 --> 01:10:09.609
by which time, of course,

01:10:09.609 --> 01:10:12.666
the democrats had lost the midterms

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:17.200
and so there was republican
control of Capitol Hill

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.645
and there was a long negotiation,

01:10:20.645 --> 01:10:22.594
the result of which,

01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:26.460
basically you can see that it turns out

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.670
to being a pretty good
bet way back in 2001

01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:35.670
because the bill that Obama signed in 2012

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:40.920
kept 82% of the Bush tax cuts

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.130
that they're now permanent.

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:46.940
And if you dig into the legislation,

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.270
all of the income tax cut rates

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:54.270
were kept except that
the incomes above 400,000

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:59.070
go back up to the 39.6% rate

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:02.470
that had prevailed before 2001.

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:06.600
So the vast majority of
the Bush tax cuts were kept

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.620
and if you look at the estate tax,

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.620
you can see that here
in 2010, it's repealed.

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:16.140
In 2011 and '12,

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:19.710
it's put back at around five million.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:24.710
And then in the new legislation,
it increases rapidly.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.930
So now, in other words, today,

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:34.217
the exemption is 22.8
million for a married couple

01:11:34.217 --> 01:11:38.930
and their rate is a 40% rate

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:42.840
as opposed to 55% rate

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.130
which they got rid of in the 2001 bill.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:50.120
So it turned out not
to have been a bad bet

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.510
to do this wonky legislation

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:57.520
through the budget reconciliation process.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.970
We might end by asking
how effective has it been

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:05.617
with respect to Grover Norquist's agenda

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:08.260
of shrinking the size of government.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.675
The answer is not very.

01:12:10.675 --> 01:12:14.610
If you measure government
by the number of employees,

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:17.560
it looks like federal
employees have remained flat.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.440
They've actually fallen some,

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.350
but that's misleading for two reasons.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:27.130
One is that if you look at
state and local government,

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:30.830
there's been a lot of
devolution of government

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:32.420
to stay at the local levels.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:37.090
By employees, the government has grown.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:37.923
Not only that.

01:12:37.923 --> 01:12:40.420
As we will be talking
about in the next lecture,

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.907
a lot of what used to be
done by the government

01:12:42.907 --> 01:12:46.080
has now been privatized and contracted out

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.100
and doesn't show up as federal workers.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.440
But if you look at federal
spending per capita,

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.060
you can see comparing receipts to spending

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:01.060
that the tax cuts have not
starved the beast in any form

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.729
that has led to a shrinking
of government spending.

01:13:06.729 --> 01:13:09.733
Here, you can look at government spending.

01:13:11.361 --> 01:13:15.430
That's from 1969 to 2029,

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:16.680
not 1069,

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.570
but you can see that
what you're seeing here

01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:23.960
is the trillion dollar deficits

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.310
that are projected by the
CBO for the next year.

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:32.070
So what's happening is
the republican's context,

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.400
they're continuing to increase spending

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.450
because that's what their
constituents want them to do

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:40.413
and that's the cost of unbundling.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.270
These pictures,

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:45.544
you can look at at your
leisure as I post them,

01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:49.030
but they basically tell the same story

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.007
that whether you look at deficits or debt,

01:13:52.007 --> 01:13:56.140
there's a secular increases now going on

01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.070
and it's not partisan.

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.360
So you can see here

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.770
and in the Reagan years,
the deficits go up,

01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:07.150
and in the Clinton years, they come down.

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.120
In the Bush years,

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.120
this is the Iraq War and
so forth, they go up.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.830
And then this is the financial crisis.

01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:17.370
They've been coming down
since the financial crisis,

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:22.309
but now, Trump's agenda
is driving them back up.

01:14:22.309 --> 01:14:25.220
These is just either
pictures of the same thing

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.131
with some details.

01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:29.980
that you can peruse at your leisure.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.950
And again, here you can see
there's no partisan story.

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:38.610
If you take the long look
over American history

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:42.700
since World War II

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.800
which was a very high
point of public debt,

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.060
it came down under democratic control

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.290
and then it's bounced around

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:54.303
and it's now going up substantially

01:14:54.303 --> 01:14:59.303
under republican control.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:03.400
And it's not just that
republicans spend money on guns

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.730
and democrats spend money on butter.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:09.638
If you look at Medicare Part
D which is prescription drugs,

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.740
when republicans controlled

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.620
all three branches of government in 2003,

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.063
they put in Medicare Part D

01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:25.530
and it's a program which
had not cost as much

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:28.290
as the CBO projected at the time,

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:31.320
but it's now costing a billion

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.740
to a 100 billion dollars a year

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.740
and will cost therefore a
trillion over the next 10,

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:41.803
over the next decade.

01:15:42.762 --> 01:15:46.500
And as for the Trump
tax cut, as you can see,

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.970
Steve Mnuchin predicted it would

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:52.000
reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.530
when in fact because of growth,

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.323
it had a they reckon about a 0.07% effect

01:15:59.323 --> 01:16:01.270
on growth for a year

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:05.480
and now it's gonna add
1.9 trillion dollars

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.130
to the deficit over the next decade.

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:11.650
And much of that in the red on the slides

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.830
which again you can see

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:17.830
is basically Trump's
additional new spending

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.780
which is approaching half a
trillion dollars per year.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.150
So the idea

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:29.400
that cutting off the supply
of money to the government

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.880
would be a way of shrinking
government has not played out

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.580
even though it's politically so potent.

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.870
Instead, we've moved from a world

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:41.450
of funding government through taxes

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:43.830
to funding government through debt

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:46.840
that will be paid by people
who have yet to be born

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.910
but they don't vote now.

01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:50.690
Okay, next we will start talking

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.383
about privatizing
government on next Tuesday.

01:16:56.715 --> 01:17:00.048

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.234
Professor Robert
Shiller: Well,

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:07.408
I have the pleasure of
introducing to you today Stephen

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:10.399
Schwarzman,
who has kindly agreed to

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.564
lecture our class.
Mr.

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:19.160
Schwarzman graduated from Yale
in 1969.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.587
He was at Davenport College.
Do we have any Davenport people

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:27.570
here?
A few, not a lot.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.610
He graduated then from Harvard
Business School in 1972.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.914
He worked for Lehman Brothers
as--I don't know if it was his

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:40.760
first job, but one of his first
jobs,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.595
and became Managing Director at
Lehman Brothers at age

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:48.647
thirty-one and he became head of
their Global Mergers and

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:51.410
Acquisitions team.
In 1985, Mr.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.680
Schwarzman, with Peter
Peterson, founded the Blackstone

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.119
Group, which has become the lead
manager of alternative assets.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.364
In some sense,
what he does and what David

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:09.766
Swensen does,
whom we had heard from earlier

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.219
this semester,
are similar.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:18.253
They're both looking at unusual
and different investment assets

00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:23.120
and they are both very
successful in doing this.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.537
Mr.
Schwarzman's firm has had a

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:32.575
return on private equity
investments of 23% a year for

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:38.500
the last--on average--for the
last twenty years.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.452
This is a little bit in excess
of David Swensen,

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:47.750
but I think we have to put them
both as remarkable investors.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.320
In the real estate group at
Blackstone, they've had 30% a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.989
year for the last fifteen years
and this is after fees.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:06.060
Blackstone Group has been very
much in the news recently.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.972
It just came out that they are
apparently going to be buying

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:17.384
$12.5 billion dollars of
leveraged loans from Citigroup

00:02:17.384 --> 00:02:21.799
at a steep discount.
So, apparently they've seen a

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.750
profit opportunity there or
they're supporting our economy

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.729
from the ravages of the subprime
crisis.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.364
Also in the news,
China has announced that it

00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:37.568
plans to buy $3 billion dollars
stake in Blackstone Group as its

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:42.607
first effort to diversify its
$1.2 trillion dollars of foreign

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:46.561
exchange reserves.
So, the Blackstone Group was

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.067
picked by the Chinese government
as the most fitting place for it

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:55.832
to put some of its reserves.
With that, I will leave it to

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:58.770
Mr.
Schwarzman, who will speak for

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.181
a while.
Mr.

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:04.422
Stephen Schwarzman: Well,
thank you very much for coming

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:08.520
out on what's a bit of dreary,
slightly rainy morning.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.492
When I was an undergraduate,
you wouldn't have gotten much

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:16.673
of an attendance;
people would have been sleeping

00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:20.311
in.
So, it's awful nice of you to

00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:23.444
be here.
There are some dramatic

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:28.650
differences from when I was an
undergraduate and you are.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.946
One of the first differences is
that this course wouldn't have

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:38.808
existed because no one had an
interest in finance at that

00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:42.275
time.
It wasn't a particularly

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:45.707
interesting time.
In the 1960s,

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:50.724
the securities markets actually
were regulated,

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:56.940
commissions were fixed on the
New York Stock Exchange;

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.789
so, it was very difficult to
find some way to compete.

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:04.200
It was sort of rigged system,
if you will,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.120
and it wasn't open.
So, there was very little to no

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.629
interest, really,
in finance.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:24.902
There really wasn't an
SOM--School of Management--at

00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:32.500
Yale at that point.
Business generally was utterly

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.713
unfashionable.
We were in the midst of the

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:41.878
Vietnam War and business was
sort of linked to the perception

00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:46.439
of that war because they
supplied certain types of war

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.517
materials and that was the most
unfashionable thing that you

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:56.357
could be involved with.
So, there was a very

00:04:56.357 --> 00:05:00.195
anti-business,
non-existent finance

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:06.870
orientation at the school and,
obviously, that's changed in

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.139
the society generally,
with enormous differences.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.379
As a result of when I grew up,
I didn't even take an economics

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.850
course at Yale.
I frankly wasn't much good with

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.393
math;
I stopped in the eleventh grade

00:05:24.393 --> 00:05:29.885
and I think calculus was,
for me, that was way too much

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:33.930
of a reach.
So, I'm more in the add,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.060
subtract, multiply,
and divide kind of category,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.410
which worked and still does
quite well for me.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.522
When I graduated,
I was lucky enough to get a job

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:53.569
at a firm that had just gone
public.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.938
It was the first New York Stock
Exchange firm that had just gone

00:05:56.938 --> 00:05:58.676
public;
it was called Donaldson,

00:05:58.676 --> 00:05:59.879
Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:06.907
Bill Donaldson actually founded
the School of Management after

00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:10.688
he left DLJ.
That was, because this is a

00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:15.106
financial markets course,
that was quite interesting for

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:19.685
me because I didn't even know
what common stock was when I

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:22.674
graduated.
Hopefully, you will have

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.299
learned more in this course.
I went to DLJ--I couldn't read

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:28.551
a financial statement,
which is like going to a

00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.490
foreign country and not being
able to speak the language;

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.349
it was sort of hopeless.
One of the interesting

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.013
experiences I had about--which
really, now that I'm a little

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:43.519
bit older and can look backwards
on financial markets,

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.170
it was my first visit to a
company.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.407
DLJ basically was one of the
first large institutional stock

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:58.855
managers of pension fund assets
and so forth and I was allowed

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:03.853
to go and interview a company.
I had never interviewed a

00:07:03.853 --> 00:07:08.926
company executive;
I read their annual report and

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:15.470
I went up to see this gentleman
and I sat there.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.549
I figured out all the things
I'd want to know so that I could

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:23.424
figure out whether I should buy
his stock or invest in his

00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:26.385
company.
I went through my list of

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:30.420
questions and he wouldn't answer
most of them.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.850
I found it a very frustrating
experience.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.733
I went back to the office and
by the time I got back to the

00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:45.505
office, Dick Jenrette,
who was president of the firm,

00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:49.476
had gotten an enraged phone
call from this executive and

00:07:49.476 --> 00:07:53.408
called me into his office.
He said, geez you made this man

00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:55.887
very angry.
I said, well how could I do

00:07:55.887 --> 00:07:58.463
that?
I was just asking questions and

00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:02.196
he wasn't answering them,
so I just asked the question

00:08:02.196 --> 00:08:04.814
again.
I couldn't quite understand why

00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:07.843
he wasn't answering me.
He said, well you were asking

00:08:07.843 --> 00:08:10.110
him things that he's not allowed
to answer.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.664
I said, what do you mean?
He said, well you were asking

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:15.355
him for inside information.
I said, well I don't know what

00:08:15.355 --> 00:08:17.864
inside information is;
I'm just asking the question

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:21.099
that I need to know to know to
answer whether to buy the stock

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:23.232
or not.
He said, well Steve,

00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:27.720
there are all these rules of
what you can ask somebody.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.544
Then if he tells you,
then he has to tell everybody

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:36.133
in the world and that's just too
cumbersome, so that's why he

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:39.025
didn't answer.
I said, well if he didn't

00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:42.420
answer, how in the world can you
figure out what to do?

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.786
I said, I'm not that smart;
I need to have all relevant

00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:50.910
data and he's the person who has
it, so why won't he give it to

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.957
me?
It became pretty clear that I

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:55.230
was doing the wrong thing for a
living.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.803
In effect, that's the dilemma
for people who want to buy

00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:05.450
liquid securities.
I decided very quickly this was

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.662
a bad business,
certainly a bad one for

00:09:08.662 --> 00:09:13.734
me--that I couldn't figure out
how I could win that game when

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:19.059
somebody wouldn't fully share
openly everything they knew.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:24.373
I guess if you were like a sumo
with a good fashion sense,

00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:29.314
that's how you manage liquid
securities and beat other

00:09:29.314 --> 00:09:31.958
people.
It's not just what you know,

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.485
it's a question of whether the
rest of the world will buy into

00:09:35.485 --> 00:09:38.029
what you know and drive that
security up.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:42.053
So, I basically retreated and
went to Harvard Business School,

00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:45.746
where I figured maybe somebody
will tell me how this game

00:09:45.746 --> 00:09:49.110
really works in a way that I can
prosper in it.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.129
That was a good experience for
me.

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:55.694
They basically taught
you--you're undergraduates,

00:09:55.694 --> 00:10:00.224
so you don't know what they're
teaching you at the school like

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.208
that--so,
I can explain it actually

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:05.009
pretty clearly.
It's basically--they're

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:10.898
teaching you that everything you
do with a company has something

00:10:10.898 --> 00:10:15.320
else to do with that company,
so that it's an integrated

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.942
system.
If you are trying to develop a

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:23.293
product for sale,
it would be good to know

00:10:23.293 --> 00:10:27.106
whether somebody wants it.
What happens,

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:30.338
actually, in the real world,
is that sometimes people just

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.512
get an interesting idea and
they'll produce a product and

00:10:33.512 --> 00:10:36.588
nobody will want it.
If you integrate all the

00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:40.942
different kinds of knowledge in
the company so that you're doing

00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:44.190
intelligent things--and I know
this appears very

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.370
elementary--you'll have a better
company.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.562
That's sort of what they were
teaching and after they taught

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:53.874
that for two or three months,
I sort of got it and thought

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.852
about dropping out of school
because it got a little

00:10:56.852 --> 00:10:59.360
repetitive,
frankly.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.334
I was convinced by my friend,
Dick Jenrette,

00:11:02.334 --> 00:11:06.830
who also thought about dropping
out of Harvard Business School.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.868
In December,
it gets very cold in Boston and

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:14.248
really miserable--he was going
to drop out and go and get a PhD

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:17.787
in Economics.
I was going to drop out and go

00:11:17.787 --> 00:11:22.384
back to the real world and he
said that his staying on was a

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:25.889
good thing and I should stay on,
so I did.

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:30.115
What I've sort of done for a
career is try and solve that

00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:34.438
problem of my initial meeting,
where people will--I want

00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:39.018
people to tell me what's really
going on, so I can figure out

00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:43.140
whether what they're saying
makes sense or doesn't make

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.669
sense.
You can do that in the private

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:50.704
equity business,
which was sort of our largest

00:11:50.704 --> 00:11:53.856
business,
and you can do that in the real

00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:57.875
estate business because you're
allowed to get all that inside

00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:00.109
information,
if you're trying to buy a

00:12:00.109 --> 00:12:03.159
company with our rules and also
the rules of other countries.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:07.827
If you sign a confidentiality
agreement that you won't use

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:12.823
that information for any purpose
other than buying the company

00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:17.027
and putting a price on it,
then the shareholders get a

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:20.782
chance to vote on whether they
want the price that you give

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.906
them.
So, to me that was like an

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:30.020
answer to my conundrum of how
could we get all the information

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.230
and then figure out what to do
with it,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.500
including improving the company.
I'm sure you know something

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.238
about private equity.
If you read the general

00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:43.740
newspapers, I'll tell you
basically what it is.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.401
Well, all we do is we buy
companies and that's the

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:52.315
simplest thing we do.
We do a lot of other things,

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:54.779
but let's start with,
we buy companies;

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:58.470
we borrow money to buy those
companies.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.224
Historically,
it's been about three dollars

00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:05.889
of debt for every one dollar of
equity.

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:11.562
We then improve those companies
through a whole variety of sort

00:13:11.562 --> 00:13:16.960
of managerial actions and then
those companies grow with the

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.513
general economy.
Let's say--if they just grow at

00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:23.183
the regular rate of all
companies, then if you're

00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:25.963
leveraged three-to-one,
you're going to earn a much

00:13:25.963 --> 00:13:29.092
better return.
If you take a company and can

00:13:29.092 --> 00:13:33.237
accelerate its growth so it's
growing faster because you've

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:36.809
improved it and you have
three-to-one leverage,

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:43.499
you'll get a way better return
then any normal stock market

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:47.586
kind of return.
That's sort of the model of

00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:52.431
what we do in that business.
As Professor Shiller was

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:57.340
saying, we've compounded,
after fees, at 23%;

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.291
but before fees,
because we charge a 20% part of

00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:06.084
the profits of the deal goes
back to the general partners,

00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:09.888
which is us.
We actually earned around 31%,

00:14:09.888 --> 00:14:13.329
which from you being in a
course like this,

00:14:13.329 --> 00:14:18.327
you'd see that's really pretty
high compared to a stock market

00:14:18.327 --> 00:14:22.543
average over a period,
which would be around 11%,

00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:25.856
in real estate,
where we do the same kind of

00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:28.980
thing.
But, real estate is an easier

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.250
business because buildings don't
talk.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.768
Management of companies talk
and you have to figure out what

00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:40.815
they're saying.
Companies are very complex--you

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:44.712
have interesting competition,
you have global

00:14:44.712 --> 00:14:49.230
competition--and it's a
complicated asset class.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.313
Real estate is very simple.
I mean there's a--buildings

00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:57.420
don't talk, so you can't get
misled by a building;

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.940
they can't tell you something;
they don't have a belief system.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.040
It's just there;
it's on the corner;

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.285
it's in the middle of the block;
and there are other buildings

00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:08.350
that are either getting built or
planned.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.400
You can figure out what the
supply/demand is for real estate

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.635
in a much easier way.
Because of that,

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:21.635
our returns in real estate have
been better because it's an

00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:25.669
easier asset class and we've
earned,

00:15:25.669 --> 00:15:31.001
after fees, 30% a year since we
started and, before fees,

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:35.832
close to 40%.
This alternative asset class,

00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:41.345
if handled right,
is really a much better way of

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:47.094
earning money for investors as
well as the general

00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:53.077
partner--let's not forget
us--than regular financial

00:15:53.077 --> 00:16:00.309
markets investing.
That world has been started

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:04.144
very small.
When we started it,

00:16:04.144 --> 00:16:09.309
the institutions had less than
1% of their assets.

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:13.462
It was like infinitesimal in
the private equity side of the

00:16:13.462 --> 00:16:16.679
business.
It's now up to about 4.5% and

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:21.850
the returns are so much higher;
you wonder why people don't

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.830
give us all their money on an
asset allocation basis.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.317
I actually still wonder why
they don't since we put most of

00:16:31.317 --> 00:16:35.417
our money in that and we keep
making more and more and

00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:39.072
outperforming.
It just takes the rest of the

00:16:39.072 --> 00:16:43.596
world apparently the equivalent
of your lifetime to sort of

00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:47.340
figure out exactly what they
should be doing.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:53.625
I think the projections are
that this should be growing at a

00:16:53.625 --> 00:17:00.230
lot faster rate going into the
future and some institutions,

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.600
like Yale, have private equity
with around--I guess it's

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.053
around--16%, 17%.
It was up to 18% of their

00:17:08.053 --> 00:17:12.639
portfolio and that's one of the
reasons why Dave Swensen has

00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:16.369
done much better than regular
money managers.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.979
Turning to a different
subject--it's a financial

00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:22.477
markets course and I thought it
would be useful to talk to you a

00:17:22.477 --> 00:17:25.920
little bit about what's really
going on in the real world.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.533
Even though this course is
being recorded and whatever you

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:37.640
say about the current moment
turns out to be right or wrong,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.779
but it's just a current moment;
it's such a fascinating one.

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:44.129
You all are,
I guess, somewhere between

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:48.977
eighteen and twenty-one years
old, probably nineteen and

00:17:48.977 --> 00:17:52.301
twenty-one,
so you don't have the

00:17:52.301 --> 00:17:58.115
perspective to understand how
really interesting and dangerous

00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:05.512
this current environment is.
What's happened is that through

00:18:05.512 --> 00:18:12.391
an abnormal issuance of
something called subprime

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:17.980
securities--nobody in this
audience,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.529
certainly people watching,
have probably owned a house.

00:18:22.529 --> 00:18:27.159
What happened was that in the
late ‘90s,

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:33.126
the government in Washington
passed a law to encourage more

00:18:33.126 --> 00:18:39.299
low-income people being able to
buy houses and resulted,

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:44.491
along with other factors,
in an explosion of these types

00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:47.159
of loans.
In terms of loans--and

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:51.898
Professor Shiller can correct me
if I'm slightly off on this--but

00:18:51.898 --> 00:18:55.893
in the year 2002,
of the total mortgage loans

00:18:55.893 --> 00:19:01.477
that were originated for houses,
probably around 2-3% of them

00:19:01.477 --> 00:19:05.854
were subprime.
These are for people who don't

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:11.722
have enough money to really pay
normal principle or interest and

00:19:11.722 --> 00:19:17.589
expect their mortgage to be
current--to not go into default.

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:24.479
By 2006, this had exploded to
30% of all the mortgages that

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:30.637
were issued that year.
When you go from 2-3% to 30%,

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:37.365
this is an almost out of body
experience and to entice these

00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:44.549
people to take these loans they
actually would tell somebody--in

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:48.292
the olden days,
when I was your age,

00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:52.900
to buy a house you had to put
up 25% of the cost of the house.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.809
Sometimes, you'd have to put up
20% of the cost of the house and

00:19:58.809 --> 00:20:02.691
you can borrow 80%.
The subprime loans--sometimes

00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:06.119
you only had to put up 3% of the
cost of the house;

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:08.980
sometimes you didn't even have
to put up anything.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:15.117
That makes it really affordable
and then you didn't have to pay

00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:18.880
any interest for two or three
years.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.984
So, you put up nothing and you
paid nothing,

00:20:22.984 --> 00:20:28.140
so this led to a stampede of
people who wanted this.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.768
What's happening now is that
the mortgage--the interest which

00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:39.210
no one--a lot of these mortgages
didn't have to pay now,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.072
two to three years later you
have to pay it and a lot of the

00:20:42.072 --> 00:20:44.450
people who didn't have the
resources can't pay the

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.710
mortgages;
those mortgages are defaulting.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:52.156
The issue that created all the
problems in the financial system

00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:57.075
that you're reading about in the
front page is that these

00:20:57.075 --> 00:21:00.940
mortgages were pooled in a new
security.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.913
Imagine just,
sort of, a jar where somebody

00:21:03.913 --> 00:21:08.302
threw in a few thousand of these
mortgages and then put the lid

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:11.679
on it.
They had these new securities

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:17.385
and what they did is they said,
well the first 83% of them must

00:21:17.385 --> 00:21:23.460
be really safe because mortgages
basically hardly ever default.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.835
They rated those--the rating
agencies, which tell people how

00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:33.025
secure something is,
rated this as a "triple-A"

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.725
security.
In the world of finance,

00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:39.450
when you tell somebody that a
security is triple-A--they get

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.923
rated all the way from AAA's
down to CCC's and CCC means

00:21:42.923 --> 00:21:46.978
something's about to blow up;
AAA means there's no possible

00:21:46.978 --> 00:21:49.940
chance you're ever going to lose
your money.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:56.250
Because 83% of this jar was
rated AAA, people bought this

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:02.898
all over the world as if it was
a security that could never,

00:22:02.898 --> 00:22:06.830
ever, ever default.
As you can see,

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:12.104
these were basically mortgages
made to low-income people who

00:22:12.104 --> 00:22:14.905
weren't even paying,
in some cases,

00:22:14.905 --> 00:22:18.154
interest on it and the chance
that these were going to default

00:22:18.154 --> 00:22:21.742
was really sky high.
Historians will go back and

00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:26.904
figure out why anybody would
believe that these things could

00:22:26.904 --> 00:22:30.800
be AAA.
They did and they were bought

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.686
everywhere;
so, these securities became

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:39.134
like American SARS.
They were exported throughout

00:22:39.134 --> 00:22:43.521
the world, creating enormous
problems for individual

00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:47.747
institutions around the world.
In the United States,

00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:51.643
they've created what will be
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:22:51.643 --> 00:22:54.549
of losses for the financial
institutions.

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:59.757
As part of Sarbanes-Oxley,
which was a law passed after

00:22:59.757 --> 00:23:04.619
Enron and some other things,
we've developed accounting

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:08.786
procedures with something
called--very technical--called

00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:11.186
FAS-157,
which is called Fair Value

00:23:11.186 --> 00:23:13.905
Accounting.
It means, before these defaults

00:23:13.905 --> 00:23:17.830
even happen, the fact that other
people think they're going to

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.949
happen results in the securities
being worth less and you have to

00:23:21.949 --> 00:23:24.910
take a loss based on that
expected value.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.519
The financial institutions were
losing all this money without

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:32.188
the defaults even happening or
people knowing how bad it would

00:23:32.188 --> 00:23:34.947
be.
As a result of that those large

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:39.170
losses, the financial market
started losing confidence in

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.166
some of the financial
institutions and different asset

00:23:43.166 --> 00:23:46.559
classes in those financial
institutions.

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:50.420
Principally banks started
trading in a really bad way.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.530
People thought they were going
to be forced to sell some of

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.500
those and we had a variety of
different asset classes,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:06.349
ranging from municipal bonds,
basically changing their value.

00:24:06.349 --> 00:24:08.396
People said,
I don't want these anymore,

00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:11.230
there were hedge funds that
owned those on leverage,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.446
so there were margin calls,
which forced those securities

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:18.910
to be sold, which made them
worth even less.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.589
That got the banks even more
nervous.

00:24:21.589 --> 00:24:26.845
That resulted in higher-rated
securities being sold that were

00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:31.011
also unleveraged.
What you had was panic selling

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:35.929
of securities rolling through
every element of the financial

00:24:35.929 --> 00:24:40.932
system as people desperately
tried to get out of stuff before

00:24:40.932 --> 00:24:45.819
it would become worth less.
This type of rapid

00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:52.231
de-leveraging resulted in
downward valuations for all

00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:59.259
these securities--a lot of hedge
funds going bankrupt.

00:24:59.259 --> 00:25:03.977
Anyone with leverage borrowing
more than five to one to carry

00:25:03.977 --> 00:25:06.730
some very secure real
securities,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.764
not subprime,
but government-oriented

00:25:09.764 --> 00:25:13.980
securities--those institutions
got into trouble.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.160
What we've had is basically
melt in the financial markets,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.559
where the banks have been so
severely impacted that they have

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:26.299
stopped lending to certain whole
asset classes,

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:30.533
particularly leveraged lending,
which we're involved with,

00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:35.298
as well as other areas.
The costs of credit have gone

00:25:35.298 --> 00:25:39.711
up, sort of, 3%,
4%, which doesn't sound like

00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:46.029
much to you, but it actually in
the overall system is a lot.

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:49.740
What that's resulted in is a
financial crisis.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.499
It's resulted in the Federal
Reserve, who's the ultimate

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:59.218
protector of the system,
very quickly lowering interest

00:25:59.218 --> 00:26:04.072
rates--agreeing to lend huge
amounts of money to the banking

00:26:04.072 --> 00:26:08.844
system because banks are now not
even lending money to each

00:26:08.844 --> 00:26:11.717
other.
They're sufficiently scared

00:26:11.717 --> 00:26:15.869
about what's going on and the
Federal Reserve is saying,

00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:19.517
well everybody can come to me
and I'll lend you all money to

00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:22.301
keep you liquid,
so this whole system doesn't

00:26:22.301 --> 00:26:25.313
stop.
As it impacts regular people is

00:26:25.313 --> 00:26:30.535
when the financial institutions
go into a crisis like this and

00:26:30.535 --> 00:26:34.730
stop lending or reduce their
lending of money.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.098
There's less money for regular
people to borrow to go about

00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:41.809
their lives and businesses to
get.

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:46.985
As that starts happening,
an economy will slow down and

00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:52.735
go into a recession and that's
what's happening in the United

00:26:52.735 --> 00:26:55.361
States.
For those of you who are

00:26:55.361 --> 00:26:58.701
graduating this year,
your prospect of getting a job

00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:02.565
will be less than the people who
graduated last year and the

00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:06.364
people who graduated the year
before had a much better deal

00:27:06.364 --> 00:27:09.769
than the ones that were
graduating last year.

00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:15.878
This is a problem that's a
pretty pervasive one and it will

00:27:15.878 --> 00:27:22.092
probably take longer to get out
of this recession than other

00:27:22.092 --> 00:27:26.718
ones that we've had.
The implications of financial

00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:30.770
markets, which may sound like
just sort of a dry academic

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.823
course--this will also effect
the outcome of presidential

00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:38.875
elections among other things
because you'll see that from

00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:43.072
what the presidential candidates
started talking about nine

00:27:43.072 --> 00:27:46.036
months ago,
which was a lot of foreign

00:27:46.036 --> 00:27:48.835
policy, war in Iraq,
which we'd be doing a better

00:27:48.835 --> 00:27:52.935
variety of those issues.
You'll see that by the time

00:27:52.935 --> 00:27:57.426
this election occurs,
that the focus will be much

00:27:57.426 --> 00:28:02.009
more and perhaps dominantly so
on the economy,

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:06.350
on people defaulting and being
thrown out of their houses,

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.930
on what's happening to the
economy generally.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:16.917
It's going to hit other things,
such as trade and the country

00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:21.076
being more populist,
more protectionist,

00:28:21.076 --> 00:28:25.612
which also has negative
implications because the United

00:28:25.612 --> 00:28:30.819
States right now is the largest
debtor nation in the world.

00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:33.238
Ten years ago,
we were the largest creditor,

00:28:33.238 --> 00:28:35.319
and when you're the largest
debtor,

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:38.169
that means you have to borrow
money all the time from people

00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:41.962
in the outside world.
If we become more protectionist

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:46.461
and outsiders basically say,
look these Americans are

00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:49.750
starting to not have an open
world;

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.786
I'm worried that maybe I won't
be able to get my money back or

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:57.359
they don't really want me to be
part of their world,

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:00.849
then there's the potential that
they will invest less with us,

00:29:00.849 --> 00:29:04.053
which again will raise our cost
of borrowing in financial

00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:06.895
markets,
whether they're for Treasuries

00:29:06.895 --> 00:29:10.776
or other types of things,
which will have the effect of

00:29:10.776 --> 00:29:15.978
again slowing our economy.
You all are about to enter the

00:29:15.978 --> 00:29:20.759
world in a very,
very, very interesting time.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:28.044
The problems with our financial
institutions are perhaps the

00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:33.230
greatest that we've had since
the 1930s,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:38.750
in the era of the Great
Depression, which is when my dad

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:44.170
was sort of a young man and he
grew up in the 1930s.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.577
Anyone who did would tell you,
that was just a disastrous

00:29:49.577 --> 00:29:54.695
economic time because those
financial institutions--as

00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:59.620
opposed to struggling the way
ours are and ours will

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:05.124
ultimately be fine--those
financial institutions collapsed

00:30:05.124 --> 00:30:10.435
because they didn't have the
kind of safeguards that the

00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:15.360
system has basically put into
our system,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.011
currently.
We learned from the 1930s how

00:30:19.011 --> 00:30:24.579
to avoid a complete collapse of
the financial institutions.

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:30.484
This is a trying time for the
system and the Federal Reserve

00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:36.589
is doing a really excellent job
at sort of guaranteeing it.

00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:40.910
If you read about the recent
Bear Stearns crisis,

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:45.859
which was front page of
literally every newspaper in the

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:48.796
world,
where the Federal Reserve

00:30:48.796 --> 00:30:53.195
stepped in and basically
provided sufficient guarantees

00:30:53.195 --> 00:30:57.919
and credit support so that this
one institution wouldn't go

00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:01.563
bankrupt.
There were--it's a brokerage

00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:03.421
firm.
Brokerage firms are not

00:31:03.421 --> 00:31:06.925
regulated by the Federal Reserve
and they don't have access to

00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:10.200
the borrowings of the Federal
Reserve to protect them,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:16.569
which is--they're sort of
outside the system.

00:31:16.569 --> 00:31:20.598
The reason why the Federal
Reserve went and did that is

00:31:20.598 --> 00:31:25.252
that the large brokerage firms,
which don't have the same kind

00:31:25.252 --> 00:31:28.980
of regulation or the same kind
of ultimate lender,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:34.697
literally have trillions and
trillions of dollars of

00:31:34.697 --> 00:31:40.976
counter-party risk--sort of
guarantees that they've given

00:31:40.976 --> 00:31:45.738
that they'll do something.
If they go bankrupt,

00:31:45.738 --> 00:31:49.653
they can't do it and that
leaves the system vulnerable to

00:31:49.653 --> 00:31:54.057
people expecting performance on
things like credit default swaps

00:31:54.057 --> 00:31:57.902
and things that are too
technical to actually explain to

00:31:57.902 --> 00:32:00.960
you at the moment.
But, there are so many

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.355
trillions of dollars of those
obligations that if they get

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:07.810
into trouble--this isn't just
like a subprime mortgage;

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:12.578
these are in the trillions.
Just credit default swaps are

00:32:12.578 --> 00:32:16.733
about forty-five trillion
dollars and the subprime

00:32:16.733 --> 00:32:21.990
mortgage losses will only be a
few hundred billion dollars.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.972
The Fed was basically going in
and saying, we can't take this

00:32:26.972 --> 00:32:31.228
risk to our overall system.
That's one reason why the stock

00:32:31.228 --> 00:32:34.864
market has gotten better because
the prospect of a collapse of

00:32:34.864 --> 00:32:37.130
the system has been really
reduced.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:42.930
I wasn't trying to depress you
on an early morning.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.636
The American system is
enormously resilient and there

00:32:47.636 --> 00:32:52.885
will be solutions that happen
over time that will deal with

00:32:52.885 --> 00:32:56.035
this.
The impact of financial

00:32:56.035 --> 00:33:01.316
markets, which is your
course--I'm just a visitor--is

00:33:01.316 --> 00:33:07.409
really driving the whole overall
economy and is affecting the

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:11.680
global economy.
The countries in Asia--China,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.008
India, and in particular those
large ones--will obviously

00:33:16.008 --> 00:33:20.876
sustain lower growth rates as a
result of this financial markets

00:33:20.876 --> 00:33:23.890
problem here in the United
States.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:29.423
You're seeing the U.K.
having already slowed down and

00:33:29.423 --> 00:33:33.417
this will probably,
as it has historically,

00:33:33.417 --> 00:33:38.837
roll into continental Europe
and result in the whole world

00:33:38.837 --> 00:33:43.563
growing slower,
higher unemployment and people

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:47.741
being adversely affected.
How financial markets work,

00:33:47.741 --> 00:33:51.076
how they're impacted,
and what would have happened if

00:33:51.076 --> 00:33:54.475
these subprime mortgages
wouldn't have been allowed to

00:33:54.475 --> 00:33:57.809
have been made from a regulatory
point of view,

00:33:57.809 --> 00:34:03.387
and what would have happened if
they were, instead of being

00:34:03.387 --> 00:34:08.099
rated AAA, they would have been
rated single B.

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:11.632
Hardly anybody would have
bought them and that would have

00:34:11.632 --> 00:34:15.670
controlled the expansion and the
risk to the financial system.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.195
Historians will look back on it
and real people,

00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:23.912
not that historians aren't,
but real practitioners will try

00:34:23.912 --> 00:34:29.162
and solve this problem by having
different types of regulation so

00:34:29.162 --> 00:34:33.510
that you can't get into this
kind of risk posture.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.390
In any case,
why don't we take some

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:41.248
questions.
That's an opening and we can

00:34:41.248 --> 00:34:44.360
talk about anything you'd like
to.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.199
Dare to be great?
Yes?

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.829
Student: I'm sort of
curious;

00:34:55.829 --> 00:35:02.666
maybe you can sort of take us
through one that went great in

00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:07.880
your opinion and one that went
very poorly.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.786
Mr.
Stephen Schwarzman: The

00:35:09.786 --> 00:35:12.213
question was,
can I take you through a good

00:35:12.213 --> 00:35:16.679
deal and a bad deal?
I assume private equity or--

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:19.185
Student: Yes.
Mr.

00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:20.846
Stephen Schwarzman:
…to show you how this

00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:24.214
works.
Well, a good deal--those are

00:35:24.214 --> 00:35:30.691
always more fun by the way--a
good deal was really our first

00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:34.420
deal.
It was a company called U.S.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.739
Steel Corporation,
which is sort of a big one.

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:41.476
It was attacked by a corporate
raider named Carl Icahn,

00:35:41.476 --> 00:35:45.159
who I think you have some
familiarity with,

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:49.864
being a prior speaker.
The corporation didn't want to

00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:53.419
be taken over,
so they were trying to marshal

00:35:53.419 --> 00:35:57.433
cash to fight him off.
The way they chose to fight him

00:35:57.433 --> 00:36:01.163
off was by buying their own
stock at a higher price to give

00:36:01.163 --> 00:36:04.249
their shareholders the
equivalent of a really big

00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:06.480
dividend,
but doing it by buying their

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.760
stock, which gave them capital
gains treatment;

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.090
so, they needed to get a bunch
of money.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.477
The way they thought about
getting some money was to sell

00:36:14.477 --> 00:36:20.090
one of their big assets;
the asset they chose to sell

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:28.891
was their railroads and barge
lines and ore boats on the Great

00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:31.563
Lakes.
To make steel,

00:36:31.563 --> 00:36:36.960
for those of you who have never
done it, it's a lot like

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.125
cooking.
You need a variety of different

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:44.230
ingredients and the ingredients,
instead of just being carried

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.719
into your house in a shopping
bag,

00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:49.375
come in on a railroad because
they're iron ore,

00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:52.030
and coke, and all these really
heavy things.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:59.311
I guess around 1880-1890 a
fellow named Andrew Carnegie,

00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:02.707
who owned U.S.
Steel--it was then called

00:37:02.707 --> 00:37:05.773
Carnegie Steel--built all these
railroads to bring this stuff

00:37:05.773 --> 00:37:06.425
in.
U.S.

00:37:06.425 --> 00:37:11.526
Steel wanted to sell it and
they didn't want to lose control

00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:16.973
of it because they felt if that
was a lifeline artery into their

00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:20.336
steel plants,
where it brought in 100% of the

00:37:20.336 --> 00:37:23.775
raw materials to make steel and
took out about 85-90% of the

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:26.690
finished product because steel
is really heavy.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.180
So, you just can't carry it out
and put it on a truck,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.880
necessarily--goes out by
railroad also.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.774
Because this was an artery that
went right into the company,

00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:41.590
if we started overcharging for
the railroad,

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.112
they were worried that we would
bankrupt the steel companies,

00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:49.028
we'd siphon off all the profit.
We did a partnership deal where

00:37:49.028 --> 00:37:51.710
we owned 51% of the railroads,
in effect;

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:58.627
they owned 49% and we--let me
show you how excessive finance

00:37:58.627 --> 00:38:02.364
can get.
I believe the deal was

00:38:02.364 --> 00:38:09.243
somewhere around 600 million
dollars--700 million dollars in

00:38:09.243 --> 00:38:14.489
1988-89, so that's a lot more
money today.

00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:23.079
We borrowed almost all the
money;

00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:28.618
I think we put up fifteen or
twenty million dollars,

00:38:28.618 --> 00:38:32.757
so the leverage was huge.
The business wasn't

00:38:32.757 --> 00:38:36.050
particularly a growth business;
it was pretty stable.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.254
We bought it in the middle of
strike, so part of the art of

00:38:39.254 --> 00:38:41.409
what we did was guessing whether
U.S.

00:38:41.409 --> 00:38:44.497
Steel would come back to the
same production level that they

00:38:44.497 --> 00:38:48.464
were before.
Our guess/analysis was correct

00:38:48.464 --> 00:38:55.258
and every year the profits from
that company would be worth more

00:38:55.258 --> 00:39:01.619
than the amount of money that we
invested in the equity.

00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:07.235
So, we ended up making
twenty-four times our money in

00:39:07.235 --> 00:39:11.217
that deal in twelve years.
In our world,

00:39:11.217 --> 00:39:15.047
not the academic world,
if you make twenty-four times

00:39:15.047 --> 00:39:19.540
your money in twelve years,
this is regarded as a success;

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:29.887
so, that was a good one.
Now, a bad one shows you a

00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:38.716
little bit about the volatility
and danger of the currency

00:39:38.716 --> 00:39:42.503
markets.
We, in 1998,

00:39:42.503 --> 00:39:53.091
bought--it might have been 1997
or 1998--controlled the second

00:39:53.091 --> 00:40:01.250
biggest cellular phone company
in Argentina,

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.699
which was an interesting place
to be.

00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:07.452
I'm sure you all have one of
these if you don't have

00:40:07.452 --> 00:40:11.866
something more elegant and some
other sort of personal device

00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:16.427
like one of these that can get
email or it can--you can talk on

00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:20.811
it.
You can almost set it up as a

00:40:20.811 --> 00:40:23.445
disco;
you can do almost anything with

00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:25.868
it.
We bought this company for

00:40:25.868 --> 00:40:30.097
eight times cash flow,
which is not real high for a

00:40:30.097 --> 00:40:34.832
company that's growing very
rapidly in what was called an

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:40.007
emerging markets country.
This particular country had its

00:40:40.007 --> 00:40:45.281
currency indexed to the dollar,
so it was almost like investing

00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:49.789
in the United States because,
what could go wrong?

00:40:49.789 --> 00:40:54.000
A rapidly growing country
invested in dollars.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.409
We borrowed dollars to buy this
company because in Argentina you

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:01.210
couldn't borrow money for a long
time.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.478
One of the great things about
the United States' financial

00:41:04.478 --> 00:41:08.090
markets is that you can borrow
debt for long periods of time.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.403
This looked to be a very
low-risk, rapidly growing

00:41:11.403 --> 00:41:15.529
situation, where we were hopeful
we were going to make four to

00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:19.827
five times our money.
There was only one problem

00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:23.740
that--Argentina the country
collapsed.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:31.014
I mean, literally collapsed.
The linkage,

00:41:31.014 --> 00:41:35.312
which is called a peg to the
dollar, turned out to be a most

00:41:35.312 --> 00:41:39.319
unfortunate thing and the
emerging markets--this is when

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:43.180
you started with the Russian
financial crisis and this

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.789
crisis.
Then you had an Asian financial

00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:48.438
crisis;
it rolled through the whole

00:41:48.438 --> 00:41:53.495
world with currencies rapidly
changing their values--all kinds

00:41:53.495 --> 00:41:56.480
of countries at risk of
collapse.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:02.890
It got to Argentina and the
whole economy pulverized;

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:07.895
it was like a depression.
They got off their linkage to

00:42:07.895 --> 00:42:11.953
the dollar;
their currency became close to

00:42:11.953 --> 00:42:14.895
worth nothing;
and then we had to pay debt

00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:18.666
back in dollars with earnings in
Argentina, which were worth

00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:21.745
nothing.
We lost every cent--every

00:42:21.745 --> 00:42:27.163
dollar we invested in that
investment--and even as we were

00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:31.630
going bankrupt,
it was still a good company.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:39.196
In finance, bad things can
happen to nice people and even

00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:47.033
when you think things through,
you can have some really bad

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:50.754
outcomes.
We've had--obviously,

00:42:50.754 --> 00:42:55.244
if you have very high returns,
you have wonderful

00:42:55.244 --> 00:43:00.670
stories--many more wonderful
stories than the bad ones.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:06.836
We bought a chemical company
called Celanese in about 2003,

00:43:06.836 --> 00:43:11.090
right after the recession was
lifting.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.368
It was a company in Germany,
but it had only 10% of its

00:43:15.368 --> 00:43:19.355
activities in Germany.
It had about 60% of them in the

00:43:19.355 --> 00:43:21.980
United States,
so it was really a U.S.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.179
company masquerading as a
German company.

00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:30.458
The price-earnings multiples of
German chemical companies were

00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:34.073
very low.
The price-earnings of American

00:43:34.073 --> 00:43:39.542
companies were much higher.
Not being entirely dim-witted,

00:43:39.542 --> 00:43:45.309
what we did was we changed the
location of the company--the

00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:50.380
headquarters--from Germany to
the United States.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.344
They also, for some reason that
we didn't completely understand,

00:43:54.344 --> 00:43:57.490
had three headquarters
operations going--two in the

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.630
United States,
one in Germany.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:05.594
We closed two of those three;
we invested a lot more money in

00:44:05.594 --> 00:44:09.519
expansion as we were coming out
of a recession;

00:44:09.519 --> 00:44:12.320
we leveraged the company pretty
highly;

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.781
and we made,
I guess it was,

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:19.704
about six times our money in
two years owning Celanese,

00:44:19.704 --> 00:44:24.079
which is on the New York Stock
Exchange now.

00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:27.070
It's a lovely company,
wonderful company.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:32.921
There are many stories of that
type, where we invest more

00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:37.936
money, move things around,
borrow a lot of money,

00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:42.429
catch fundamentals as they're
going up.

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:47.420
The good stories are really a
lot of fun;

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:54.039
we enjoy those and so do our
investors.

00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:59.034
Those are--I gave you two
winners and one loser instead

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:04.204
one and one because,
in our real estate business,

00:45:04.204 --> 00:45:09.130
we've probably,
just to give you perspective,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:15.847
we've only lost money on two
situations in our history out of

00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:20.864
about 160 investments.
The number of good stories to

00:45:20.864 --> 00:45:24.372
bad stories--I mean,
this isn't like Las Vegas where

00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:27.880
you end up as a net loser or
it's a lot of luck.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:34.067
Every time you do one of these
things, you have a team of

00:45:34.067 --> 00:45:39.813
people working on it,
some of whom are in their early

00:45:39.813 --> 00:45:45.548
40s, who are usually partners.
Then, each one of the firms

00:45:45.548 --> 00:45:49.358
scales down in some kind of
hierarchy, where you have

00:45:49.358 --> 00:45:52.253
managing directors,
and vice presidents,

00:45:52.253 --> 00:45:54.179
and associates,
and analysts.

00:45:54.179 --> 00:45:59.731
The folks like yourself tend to
get hired at firms like ours as

00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:04.030
analysts, which means you do
statistical work.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.201
I guess they're called now
models on a computer,

00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:13.438
which give us an idea that if
any of the variables affecting

00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:17.497
these deals change,
how will it affect the overall

00:46:17.497 --> 00:46:21.130
earnings of the company,
or cash flow of the company,

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:24.489
or our ability to service the
debt of that company.

00:46:24.489 --> 00:46:27.830
Then we can figure out,
from doing that,

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:31.769
what price we'd want to pay for
the company,

00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:35.274
how much debt we could safely
put on it so that the business

00:46:35.274 --> 00:46:39.439
doesn't get in trouble.
Now, this analyst program that

00:46:39.439 --> 00:46:44.709
firms like ours have and people
all over Wall Street have is

00:46:44.709 --> 00:46:48.639
like a huge industry for people
your age.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:55.589
This didn't exist when I was in
college and I'm actually not

00:46:55.589 --> 00:47:01.386
that old compared to you.
I sort of think I'm almost the

00:47:01.386 --> 00:47:06.182
same age, a little older,
but it's amazing having people

00:47:06.182 --> 00:47:10.005
like yourselves.
I mean, in two years you could

00:47:10.005 --> 00:47:14.408
be in my conference room with
all the rest of the team talking

00:47:14.408 --> 00:47:18.739
about a live deal and putting in
your two cents--a perception

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:22.710
whether you think something's a
little more risky.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.652
What we do at our firm,
whenever we're considering

00:47:24.652 --> 00:47:27.070
something, we always go around
the table and ask everybody.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.117
So, we're not trying to
intimidate anybody,

00:47:30.117 --> 00:47:34.325
but we figure that if somebody
your age has been working on

00:47:34.325 --> 00:47:37.880
something and knows the numbers
sort of cold,

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.212
you'll have some views.
It's always fun,

00:47:40.212 --> 00:47:43.497
particularly for me,
to ask because that's how you

00:47:43.497 --> 00:47:47.559
start the process of learning.
Finance is a business that is

00:47:47.559 --> 00:47:51.554
an apprentice business.
It's sort of like going back to

00:47:51.554 --> 00:47:56.085
the Middle Ages where they had
guilds and you'd learn your

00:47:56.085 --> 00:48:00.934
business by apprenticing with
somebody else who's already done

00:48:00.934 --> 00:48:03.126
it.
There's a base level of

00:48:03.126 --> 00:48:07.118
knowledge that you have to have
in finance before you can be

00:48:07.118 --> 00:48:10.030
creative.
The only way you get that is by

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.163
working with other people who've
already done it and are doing

00:48:14.163 --> 00:48:16.932
it.
People take enormous care when

00:48:16.932 --> 00:48:21.893
working with folks like yourself
in terms of making sure you get

00:48:21.893 --> 00:48:24.904
the right answer or not.
What I'd say,

00:48:24.904 --> 00:48:28.848
which is different in the real
world--as a visitor from the

00:48:28.848 --> 00:48:32.589
real world to you in the
academic world--one of the real

00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:36.145
differences is,
in the real world there is only

00:48:36.145 --> 00:48:40.111
one grade for every project,
which is the equivalent of a

00:48:40.111 --> 00:48:44.750
course,
and that is an A grade.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.289
The definition of an A isn't
the same as in academics.

00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:50.640
In academics,
you can get an A--and I don't

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.942
know what Yale's current grading
curve is now--you can get A

00:48:53.942 --> 00:48:56.653
sometimes with a ninety,
you can get an A with a

00:48:56.653 --> 00:48:59.039
ninety-two, you can get an A
with ninety-three;

00:48:59.039 --> 00:49:01.690
that's sort of pretty
good--that's an A.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:07.625
In our world, an A is a hundred.
This was shocking to me because

00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:11.809
I wasn't a one hundred kind of
person.

00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:18.100
My first project that I
did--just to give you an idea of

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:25.191
the real need for excellence and
perfection in what we do--is I

00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:30.179
was assigned a project.
I worked on it really hard;

00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:32.900
I wrote something up that was
like a term paper,

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.619
which normally you only get to
do one a year.

00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:38.256
In the real world,
you get to do them every two to

00:49:38.256 --> 00:49:41.177
three weeks.
I submitted this thing to a

00:49:41.177 --> 00:49:45.592
gentleman named Herman Kahn,
who was a partner at Lehman

00:49:45.592 --> 00:49:50.570
Brothers--an older partner at
the time when I was doing it.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:55.981
I sent it down to him and he
was waiting for this project and

00:49:55.981 --> 00:50:00.039
I got a phone call about three
hours later.

00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:06.341
It sort of went like this:
"This is Herman Kahn calling,

00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:11.670
is this Steve Schwarzman?"
I said, "Yes it is, Mr. Kahn."

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:17.643
He said, "I got your paper;
there's a typo on page

00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:20.960
forty-three."
Bang.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.980
That is the only thing I ever
heard from Herman Kahn.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:33.144
A slammed phone because a comma
was in the wrong place on this

00:50:33.144 --> 00:50:38.900
piece of work and I had really
struggled.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.602
That's all I got--an angry man
and a slammed phone and I

00:50:44.602 --> 00:50:49.164
basically said,
what kind of crazy world am I

00:50:49.164 --> 00:50:52.380
in?
What is this about?

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:57.622
What I learned is that any
piece of work that you did that

00:50:57.622 --> 00:51:02.496
wasn't completely correct,
you got a version of Herman

00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:06.424
Kahn in your face.
Different people did it

00:51:06.424 --> 00:51:09.654
different ways,
but this was a radically

00:51:09.654 --> 00:51:15.119
different world--the real world
in finance--than I was used to.

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:18.693
I was a major here in something
that doesn't exist,

00:51:18.693 --> 00:51:22.980
I'm sure, anymore--a creature
of the 1960s called Culture and

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.267
Behavior.
What we did is we had an

00:51:26.267 --> 00:51:31.571
interdisciplinary major with--in
psychology, sociology,

00:51:31.571 --> 00:51:35.499
biology, and anthropology.
In other words,

00:51:35.499 --> 00:51:39.889
we studied how people thought
and why they thought that way.

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:42.679
I thought that was a pretty
neat thing to be doing.

00:51:42.679 --> 00:51:46.140
We had professors from each of
those disciplines;

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:51.131
we had two seminars a week;
we had eight students in the

00:51:51.131 --> 00:51:55.139
major and we had four professors
working with us all the time.

00:51:55.139 --> 00:52:00.479
So, I was used to a little
softer, more loveable world than

00:52:00.479 --> 00:52:03.281
finance.
So, finance for me was

00:52:03.281 --> 00:52:08.583
shocking--that people would have
to have everything correct all

00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:11.199
the time.
At your level,

00:52:11.199 --> 00:52:16.537
what you'll be doing--that's
sort of what it is,

00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:20.720
there's no alternative.
People are nice,

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.949
they'll help you get there,
but there's no,

00:52:23.949 --> 00:52:28.869
absolutely no flexibility in
terms of getting perfect scores.

00:52:28.869 --> 00:52:33.057
Now, once you do that--I'm
giving you a little career

00:52:33.057 --> 00:52:37.729
advice here--you do that for
about two years or three years

00:52:37.729 --> 00:52:42.239
and then after that you can
start being more creative and

00:52:42.239 --> 00:52:45.380
finance can be a really
creative,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.654
interesting,
problem-solving business,

00:52:48.654 --> 00:52:54.113
where it's global--it's fun.
I mean, in my last two weeks,

00:52:54.113 --> 00:52:59.118
where have I been?
Let's see, certainly in New

00:52:59.118 --> 00:53:04.126
Haven now;
I was in Bahrain,

00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:12.434
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Abu Dhabi, Dubai,

00:53:12.434 --> 00:53:21.179
Cambodia, Korea,
Ireland and Germany.

00:53:21.179 --> 00:53:26.237
It's actually really
interesting and you meet people

00:53:26.237 --> 00:53:31.127
all over the world;
you get to see how they think

00:53:31.127 --> 00:53:35.967
about issues--how their
financial systems and their

00:53:35.967 --> 00:53:39.412
economies work.
During that trip,

00:53:39.412 --> 00:53:43.717
I met heads of countries,
heads of financial

00:53:43.717 --> 00:53:47.511
institutions.
You're trying to figure out

00:53:47.511 --> 00:53:52.299
really the most complex stuff in
the world, which is how all

00:53:52.299 --> 00:53:55.869
these systems work and how they
interact.

00:53:55.869 --> 00:54:03.826
Ultimately, what you will do in
an individual situation is based

00:54:03.826 --> 00:54:10.899
upon this immense flow of
knowledge and data and cultural

00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:15.300
differences.
I missed China and India on

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:19.620
this trip, but we get them on
other trips and it's

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.852
really--finance done
appropriately is a wonderful

00:54:23.852 --> 00:54:27.952
lifetime learning,
ever changing,

00:54:27.952 --> 00:54:33.345
exciting kind of business.
It's not like,

00:54:33.345 --> 00:54:37.929
sort of, selling socks to a
department store;

00:54:37.929 --> 00:54:43.369
this is a really fascinating
business--it never stays the

00:54:43.369 --> 00:54:45.643
same.
You have so many different

00:54:45.643 --> 00:54:48.767
people in so many different
countries making so many

00:54:48.767 --> 00:54:51.280
different kinds of decisions
that you,

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.700
as one decision maker in that
enormously complicated

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:58.658
matrix--the chance that you're
going to get it right is only

00:54:58.658 --> 00:55:02.615
because you're absorbing as much
information as you can from

00:55:02.615 --> 00:55:06.639
every place and trying to thread
the needle to make a correct

00:55:06.639 --> 00:55:09.248
decision.
It's a lot of fun,

00:55:09.248 --> 00:55:13.244
so any of you who go from this
course into being a

00:55:13.244 --> 00:55:16.689
practitioner,
which is sort of what I am in

00:55:16.689 --> 00:55:20.895
the real world--it happens to
have historically been quite

00:55:20.895 --> 00:55:25.544
financially rewarding,
which I guess is like a--I used

00:55:25.544 --> 00:55:30.429
to think that was a really good
thing, until the U.S.

00:55:30.429 --> 00:55:33.190
is reevaluating exactly what it
thinks about success.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:38.956
But, it's basically a good
thing and it's fascinating and I

00:55:38.956 --> 00:55:45.420
would encourage you if you have
an interest in it to pursue it.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.556
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:55:47.556 --> 00:55:48.853
Mr.
Stephen Schwarzman: Can you

00:55:48.853 --> 00:55:52.729
speak up a little?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:55:52.729 --> 00:55:59.008
profitable and my second
question for you is from where

00:55:59.008 --> 00:56:05.403
and what kinds of classes do you
see the next return for

00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:07.789
[inaudible]?
Mr.

00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:11.889
Stephen Schwarzman: Okay,
it was a question about carried

00:56:11.889 --> 00:56:15.989
interest being taxed at a lower
rate and the next question is

00:56:15.989 --> 00:56:19.816
what asset class do we think is
going to have really high

00:56:19.816 --> 00:56:22.550
returns over the next five
years.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:28.384
On the carried interest
question, this is something that

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:32.840
has been pretty well,
sort of, surfaced.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:39.454
There are a bunch of arguments
from different sides of the

00:56:39.454 --> 00:56:44.945
political spectrum on this.
Folks like ourselves,

00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:50.716
who have had carried interest
taxed at capital gains rates

00:56:50.716 --> 00:56:55.260
since the 1930s,
are sort of wondering where the

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:59.374
whole discussion is coming from.
In other words,

00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:03.523
this has been going on for
longer than I've been

00:57:03.523 --> 00:57:08.820
alive--that this has been a
capital gains treatment item.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:15.187
The way carried interest works
is, we get a 20% share of the

00:57:15.187 --> 00:57:21.122
profits of any investment over
some type of hurdle rate,

00:57:21.122 --> 00:57:25.403
which is a minimum return.
In our case,

00:57:25.403 --> 00:57:31.266
usually it's around 8%.
To get this carried interest,

00:57:31.266 --> 00:57:37.648
we have to invest significant
monies in our funds,

00:57:37.648 --> 00:57:43.769
which is totally unlike normal
compensation.

00:57:43.769 --> 00:57:48.042
Most people--to get--some
people in the government want to

00:57:48.042 --> 00:57:51.040
characterize this as normal
compensation,

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.376
ordinary income;
people who get ordinary income

00:57:54.376 --> 00:57:57.500
just work and they get it.
They normally don't invest

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.949
millions of dollars for the
opportunity to get their salary.

00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:06.359
We also have to--if we don't
make a certain minimum return

00:58:06.359 --> 00:58:11.010
and we've gotten some of this
carried interest,

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:14.662
by the time a whole fund's
over, we have to pay the carried

00:58:14.662 --> 00:58:17.980
interest back.
Most people who earn ordinary

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.760
income don't pay back their
income after they've gotten it.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.213
Carried interest basically
comes out of splitting the

00:58:31.213 --> 00:58:37.938
profits from a partnership,
where it's sort of quite normal

00:58:37.938 --> 00:58:46.783
for a working partner to get
more of a deal than just a

00:58:46.783 --> 00:58:52.327
passive investor.
Whether it's somebody just in a

00:58:52.327 --> 00:58:56.642
family--somebody who works in
the business and somebody else

00:58:56.642 --> 00:59:01.250
in the family puts up the money
to buy part of the business.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.739
Usually, the person working in
the business gets more.

00:59:04.739 --> 00:59:10.739
So, we sort of look at this as
sort of an issue that's now in

00:59:10.739 --> 00:59:16.539
the political world and it will
be solved in that world.

00:59:16.539 --> 00:59:25.101
We don't have much of a say in
that, but I would say that the,

00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:33.382
sort of, characterization of
this is being something as sort

00:59:33.382 --> 00:59:38.845
of an odd thing.
It's really been going on for

00:59:38.845 --> 00:59:42.508
eighty years,
so I don't quite understand

00:59:42.508 --> 00:59:48.095
exactly why it's officially odd
now and it hasn't been for all

00:59:48.095 --> 00:59:52.465
that time period.
The second part of that

00:59:52.465 --> 00:59:58.610
question is--I'll ask it a
different way than it was asked,

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.252
which is, what's going to be
the best performing asset class

01:00:02.252 --> 01:00:06.444
over the next five years?
I think that was more or less

01:00:06.444 --> 01:00:10.629
what you were asking.
It's always hard to tell

01:00:10.629 --> 01:00:15.923
exactly what that will be,
but typically you have to have

01:00:15.923 --> 01:00:21.596
a view of the world and I think
our view of the world is that

01:00:21.596 --> 01:00:27.364
the economies of the developed
countries are going to get hurt

01:00:27.364 --> 01:00:33.433
over the next year or so.
It ought to drive down asset

01:00:33.433 --> 01:00:39.412
values of a variety of types and
there should be a great

01:00:39.412 --> 01:00:44.812
opportunity out about,
sort of, a year to start buying

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:49.831
companies and other types of
assets at what should prove to

01:00:49.831 --> 01:00:53.829
be a bottom.
Then, if you can leverage those

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:57.574
assets, as the economy keeps
getting better,

01:00:57.574 --> 01:01:00.710
you'll make really great
returns.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:06.053
The last time this set of
circumstances presented

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:11.396
themselves was 2002,
after the recession in 2001,

01:01:11.396 --> 01:01:17.859
which went into 2002.
We were the biggest purchaser

01:01:17.859 --> 01:01:23.949
of companies in the world in
2003 and 2004 and,

01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:28.045
as a result of that,
the fund that we used to buy

01:01:28.045 --> 01:01:31.969
those companies earned about 51%
after fees,

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:38.275
which for those who keep score
of these things is really quite

01:01:38.275 --> 01:01:42.841
extraordinary.
We think that kind of cycle is

01:01:42.841 --> 01:01:47.721
going to repeat itself.
We would think that the private

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:52.743
equity business--you're seeing
now, we've just involved with a

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:56.941
deal that Professor Shiller
mentioned--it was in the

01:01:56.941 --> 01:02:02.692
newspaper this week,
I guess--where we were buying

01:02:02.692 --> 01:02:08.039
assets from Citibank--loans at
discounts.

01:02:08.039 --> 01:02:14.543
There will be opportunities in
the debt area over the next year

01:02:14.543 --> 01:02:18.740
or so that also ought to be very
good.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.651
Yes?
Student: How do you feel

01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:25.510
about and how do you deal with
failures in investments,

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:30.585
like your Argentina investment?
And how do you think that in

01:02:30.585 --> 01:02:32.382
the future?
Mr.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:36.239
Stephen Schwarzman: The
question is, how do we deal with

01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:39.050
failure like our Argentinean
investment?

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:43.736
The second part of that was?
Student: How do you

01:02:43.736 --> 01:02:45.630
think the private equity will
evolve in the future?

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.619
Mr.
Stephen Schwarzman: How do

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:48.050
we think private equity will
evolve in the future?

01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:52.300
How do we deal with failure?
I really hate failure.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:03:01.079
I mean it's deep, it's visceral;
I really can't stand it.

01:03:01.079 --> 01:03:08.432
Because I feel so passionately
about that, the people who work

01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:14.820
at our firm, all of whom I've
been involved hiring,

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.418
understand how I feel about
failure and so we don't have a

01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:23.210
lot of people around who like
failing either.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:26.305
One, because they don't want to
disappoint me,

01:03:26.305 --> 01:03:30.639
but two, because I don't hire
people who don't feel the same;

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:33.949
this is like a passion not to
fail.

01:03:33.949 --> 01:03:41.190
When we fail it's a major,
major, major event.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:47.231
This is not a normal thing.
What we do when we fail is we

01:03:47.231 --> 01:03:52.800
spend enormous time thinking
through, what did we do wrong;

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.650
what should we have seen;
are our processes good;

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:06.387
did we misidentify a variable
that got us or did we identify

01:04:06.387 --> 01:04:14.780
it and didn't evaluate how bad
that can be--we got that wrong.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.407
Or did we just simply have bad
luck where there are three or

01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:19.989
four bad things that could
happen and they all happened,

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:24.539
like in a very rapid period of
time?

01:04:24.539 --> 01:04:28.991
Failure is a--how you manage
failure is very important and

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:33.989
some people manage failure by
making pretend it didn't happen.

01:04:33.989 --> 01:04:36.766
They just go about their jobs
and people don't pay

01:04:36.766 --> 01:04:39.260
attention--well we lost money on
that one.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.809
I don't believe in that.
I like to learn.

01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:46.830
Sometimes, you learn more from
your failures than you do from

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.820
your successes.
We actually changed the way we

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:53.707
made decisions at the whole firm
after a very early failure that

01:04:53.707 --> 01:04:57.099
we had had and changed our whole
investment process;

01:04:57.099 --> 01:05:01.750
that one failure created most
of our successes.

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:06.945
Failure--when you make a lot of
decisions--I used to think we

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:12.742
could make no mistakes.
That's what I always try and

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:20.914
do, but if you're very active in
making decisions--I think about

01:05:20.914 --> 01:05:28.307
this stuff so much that we
probably get about 90 to 93% of

01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:35.389
our decisions correct,
maybe a tiny bit higher;

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:40.010
but, that means we've failed a
lot, so there's 7% failure.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:45.296
Sometimes we get 95% right,
but we're still making 5%

01:05:45.296 --> 01:05:51.860
failure across the firm.
So, we're always struggling to

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:57.739
improve and get that down to
almost nothing.

01:05:57.739 --> 01:06:03.320
So, failure is a really
important element in learning.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.239
It's like bad dating.
You date somebody,

01:06:06.239 --> 01:06:08.570
it doesn't work out;
that's the way,

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:12.949
by the way, most dating is--it
doesn't work out.

01:06:12.949 --> 01:06:15.050
Works out for a while,
then it doesn't work out.

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:20.029
So, all of you would probably
think about, what did I learn

01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:22.531
from this?
Why did I get involved with

01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:24.870
this person?
Was this a good thing on

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:29.131
balance or not a good thing?
Am I going to repeat this

01:06:29.131 --> 01:06:32.449
mistake in the future?
What did I learn?

01:06:32.449 --> 01:06:36.790
That's what we all do in our
own lives and we do it in our

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:40.514
commercial life as well.
Second part of that question

01:06:40.514 --> 01:06:42.820
was the evolution on private
equity.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.639
Private equity is an enduring
asset class because it basically

01:06:47.639 --> 01:06:52.278
makes really great returns.
It attracts very talented

01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:55.328
people.
It reallocates capital around

01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:58.480
the globe.
It goes where there's

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:04.343
opportunity and it improves
companies by investing more

01:07:04.343 --> 01:07:11.480
capital in these businesses.
So, there's an enduring place

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.469
for private equity.
Right now, there's a capital

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:18.397
crunch and there's not much
money available to borrow except

01:07:18.397 --> 01:07:21.957
on smaller deals.
That circumstance happened

01:07:21.957 --> 01:07:25.809
briefly in 2002,
it happened in 1990-91,

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:29.167
happened in 1987,
happened in 1982,

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:33.380
happened in 1975;
so, it happens.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.233
When it happens,
everybody always says,

01:07:36.233 --> 01:07:40.590
oh my goodness this business is
going away and so forth;

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.363
that never ends up occurring
because capital always comes

01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:46.181
back.
The evolution of the business

01:07:46.181 --> 01:07:49.846
will have a few super-bracket
kind of firms,

01:07:49.846 --> 01:07:53.139
like ourselves,
who keep attracting more and

01:07:53.139 --> 01:07:55.652
more capital,
who are investing globally,

01:07:55.652 --> 01:07:58.039
who have people all over the
world.

01:07:58.039 --> 01:08:02.996
The future for these kinds of
businesses, I think,

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:09.756
is pretty good--quite good.
You have smaller firms that are

01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:16.421
in individual countries,
sometimes segmented by an area

01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:21.203
of concentration.
You'll have a healthcare group

01:08:21.203 --> 01:08:24.520
and some of those businesses
will do well;

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.941
some will wither.
You have smaller firms that do

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:32.369
smaller kinds of deals;
there's always a place for that.

01:08:32.369 --> 01:08:38.025
So, I think that private equity
tends to grow in step functions,

01:08:38.025 --> 01:08:43.592
as a function of how much money
institutions have to put in the

01:08:43.592 --> 01:08:46.489
class.
When stock markets go down and

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:50.553
institutions generally have less
money, they put less money in

01:08:50.553 --> 01:08:53.029
the class.
When the markets get better,

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:55.904
they put more money,
so it's not a straight line of

01:08:55.904 --> 01:08:58.145
growth;
it's a little wavy like that

01:08:58.145 --> 01:09:07.000
and I think that will continue.
I think we're done.

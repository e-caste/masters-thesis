00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.647
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Stable equilibrium,

00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:08.313
and if you disturb them,
they rock back and forth and

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:14.808
there are two simple examples.
The standard textbook example

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:19.507
is this mass on spring.
This spring has a certain

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:21.810
natural length,
which I'm showing you here.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.268
It likes to sit there.
But if you pull it so the mass

00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:31.174
comes here, you move it from
x = 0 to a new location

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:34.734
x;
then, there is a restoring

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.159
force F,
which is -kx,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.738
and that force will be equal to
mass times acceleration by

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:45.500
Newton's law,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.102
and so you're trying to solve
the equation d^(2)x/dt^(2) =

00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:02.688
-k/m times x,
and we use the symbol,

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.870
ω^(2) = k/m,
or ω square root of

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.010
k/m.
And what's the solution to this

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.029
equation?
I think we did a lot of talking

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.262
and said look,
we are looking for a function

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:16.219
which,
when differentiated twice,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.140
looks like the same function up
to some constants,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.360
and we know they are
trigonometry functions.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.340
Then, we finally found the
answer.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.379
The most general answer looks
like A cos ωt - φ.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.849
A is the amplitude,
φ is called the phase.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.059
That tells you what your clock
is doing when x is a

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:39.099
maximum, and we can always
choose φ to be 0.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.650
That means when the time is 0,
x will have the biggest

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.582
value A.
This is an example of simple

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:48.848
harmonic motion.
But it is a very generic

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:51.280
situation, so I'll give you a
second example.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.862
Now, we don't have a mass but
we have a bar,

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:59.610
let's say, suspended by a
cable, hanging from the ceiling,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.443
and it's happy the way it is.
But if you come and twist it by

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:07.065
angle θ,
give it a little twist,

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.620
then it will try to untwist
itself.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.534
So, now we don't have a
restoring force but we have a

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:16.294
restoring torque.
What can be the expression for

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:19.750
the restoring torque?
When you don't do anything,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.711
it doesn't do anything,
so it's a function of θ

00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.740
that vanishes when θ is
0.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.714
If θ is not 0,
it'll begin as some function of

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.970
θ, but the leading term
would be just θ.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.479
But now, you can put a constant
here.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.484
It'll still be proportional to
θ, and you put a minus

00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.538
sign for the same reason you put
a minus sign here to tell you

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:42.944
it's a restoring torque.
That means if you make

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:45.091
θ positive,
the torque will try to twist

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.316
you the other way.
If you make θ negative

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.796
it'll try to bring you back.
So, you have to find this

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:52.575
κ.
If you find this κ then

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:56.523
you can say -κ times
θ is I times

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:59.180
d^(2)θ over
dt^(2).

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.037
Mathematically,
that equation's identical to

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:05.759
that, and θ then will
look like some constant.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:10.692
You can call it A cos (ωt-
φ, and ω [squared]

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:15.139
now will be the ratio of this
κ at the moment of

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.491
inertia,
because mathematically that's

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.539
the role played by κ and
I.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:20.780
They are like k and
m.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.317
Now, if someone tells you this
is κ,

00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:28.333
then you are done.
You just stick it in and

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.849
mindlessly calculate all the
formulas.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.490
You can find θ,
you can derivatives and so on.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.210
Sometimes, they may not tell
you what κ is.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.489
In the case of a spring,
they would have to give you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.411
k or they may tell you
indirectly if I pull this spring

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.717
by 9 inches,
I exert a certain force,

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:48.018
they're giving you F and
they're giving you x and

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:50.723
you can find k.
But in rotation problems,

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:52.919
the typical situation is the
following.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.979
Let us take the easiest problem
of a pendulum.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.591
The pendulum is hanging,
say a massless rod,

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:04.020
with some mass m at the
bottom.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.020
So, it's very happy to stay
this way.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.100
If you leave it like this,
it would stay this way forever.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.616
No torque, no motion.
Now, you come along and you

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:16.350
disturb that by turning it by an
angle θ.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.552
If you do, then the force is
like this, the separation vector

00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:25.019
r from the pivot point is
this,

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:28.954
and r cross F
will be non-zero because the

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:33.869
angle between them is not 0,
and you remember that torque is

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:38.336
equal to rF sin θ,
and I told you for small

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.301
angles,
this can be rF θ,

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:44.864
and r happens to be,
in this problem,

00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:50.880
the length of the pendulum,
so it's really -mgl θ.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.817
So, you have to do some work to
find θ [correction:

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.373
should have said κ].
It wasn't just given to you on

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:01.387
a plate.
You did this piece of thinking,

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:04.345
and namely, you disturbed the
system from equilibrium and

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:07.457
found the restoring torque.
Then, you stared at the formula

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:10.315
and say hey, this guy must be
the κ I'm looking for

00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:12.828
because that number times
θ is the restoring

00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:15.406
torque.
Then the ω here will

00:05:15.406 --> 00:05:19.307
be--this κ is a generic
κ that goes into

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:22.820
whatever it is for that problem.
For our problem,

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.139
κ happens to be
mgl.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.970
That's something you should
understand.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.765
It's not a universal number
that's known to everybody like

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:35.380
the spring constant of anything.
In the case of mass and this

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.694
pendulum, it depends on how long
the pendulum is,

00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:39.960
how big the mass is,
but you can work it out and

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.781
extract κ.
Downstairs, you need the

00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:46.918
momentum of inertia for a point
mass m at a distance

00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:49.700
l from the point of
rotation,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.787
which is ml^(2).
So, you can cancel the

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:56.107
l, you can cancel the
m, and you get ω

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.190
is root of g over
l.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.259
Let me remind you guys that
ω is connected to what

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.240
you and I would call the
frequency by this 2π,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.222
or what you and I would call
the time period by 2π

00:06:11.222 --> 00:06:12.060
over T.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.490
Okay, so this is the situation.
Let me give one other example.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.216
This is a homework problem,
but I want to give you a hint

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:27.817
on how to do this.
Don't take a pendulum with all

00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:31.461
the mass concentrated there.
Take some irregularly shaped

00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:36.271
object, a flat planar object.
You drive a nail through it

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:41.598
there, hang it on the wall.
It'll come to rest in a certain

00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:46.194
configuration and you should
think about where will the

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:50.959
center of mass be if I hang it
like this on the wall?

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.329
Center of mass is somewhere in
the body here.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.900
So, I want you to think about
it.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.065
I'll tell you in a second.
The center of mass,

00:06:58.065 --> 00:07:03.451
they claim, will lie somewhere
on this vertical line going

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:06.901
through that point.
I know that by default because

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:08.822
if the center of mass is here,
for example,

00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:11.246
we know all the force of
gravity can be imagined to be

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:13.029
acting here [pointing to
drawing].

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:15.774
Then if you do that separation
and do the torque,

00:07:15.774 --> 00:07:19.377
then you will find this is able
to exert a torque on this point,

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:21.550
but that cannot be in
equilibrium.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.870
So, center of mass will align
itself.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.839
The body would swing a little
bit and settle down;

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:32.300
the center of mass somewhere
there.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.112
If you now disturb the body,
I don't want to draw another

00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:38.566
picture, but I'll probably fail.
This is the rotated body,

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:42.620
off from its ideal position,
then there will be a torque.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.096
What will the torque be?
It'll be the same thing minus

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:49.397
mgl sin θ,
which I'm going to replace by

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:52.752
θ.
l is now the distance

00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:56.940
between the pivot point and the
center of mass.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.360
That's your torque.
So, you can read the κ.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.759
In fact, it's just like the
pendulum.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.537
In other words,
as far as the torque is

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:08.110
concerned, it's as if all the
mass were sitting here.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.829
The difference will be in a
moment of inertia.

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:13.527
Moment of inertia of this is
not ml^(2),

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:16.642
so don't make the mistake.
All the mass is not sitting

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:18.426
here.
All the mass is sitting all

00:08:18.426 --> 00:08:21.328
over the place.
So, you should know that if you

00:08:21.328 --> 00:08:25.077
want the moment of inertia,
it is I with respect to

00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:27.839
center of mass plus this
ml^(2).

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.649
That's the old parallel axis
theorem.

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:34.713
So, take that moment of inertia
and put that into this formula

00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:36.684
here;
take this κ and put it

00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:38.389
there, you'll get some
frequency.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:40.769
That's the frequency with which
it will oscillate.

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:44.948
So, every problem that you will
ever get will look like one of

00:08:44.948 --> 00:08:47.025
these two.
Either there is something

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:49.537
moving linearly with a
coordinate that you can call

00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:52.339
x,
or it's rotating or twisting by

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:56.439
an angle you can call θ.
And if you want to find out the

00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:59.278
frequency of vibration,
you have to disturb it from

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:01.691
equilibrium,
either by pulling the mass or

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:04.545
by twisting the cable or
displacing this pendulum from

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:07.514
its ideal position here,
then finding the restoring

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:08.899
torque.
Yep?

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:10.683
Student: What can we say
[inaudible]

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.680
its restoring torque in the
twisting example?

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.593
How do we describe that?
Professor Ramamurti

00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:17.389
Shankar: That's a very good
point.

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:20.214
His question is,
if I gave you a cable and I

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:24.090
twist the cable by some angle,
how are we going to calculate

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.799
restoring torque?
Here is the good news.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:30.549
This problem is so hard we'll
give it to you.

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:33.006
In other words,
there is, of course,

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.412
an underlying answer.
Given a cable,

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:38.243
made of some material and its
torsional properties,

00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:41.980
how much of a torque you'll get
if you twist it by some amount,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.795
but it's not something you can
calculate from first principle,

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:46.780
so they'll simply have to give
it to you,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.929
okay, in such problems.
The only time you'll have to

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:53.122
find the torque on your own is
in a problem like this where I

00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:55.889
believe you know enough to
figure out the torque.

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.779
Okay, what you will find is,
if you leave it alone,

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:01.669
it'll go to a position where
there is no torque.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.973
If you move it off the
position, there will be a

00:10:03.973 --> 00:10:06.718
torque, and the torque will
always be proportional to the

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:08.629
angle by which you've displaced
it.

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.745
You read off the
proportionality constant and

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:11.900
that's your κ.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.250
You should look at the forces
too.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.566
It is pretty interesting.
This body, when it is hanging

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:23.429
in its rest position,
has two forces on it.

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:26.480
The nail, which is pushing up
and the weight of the body which

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.779
is pushing down,
and they cancel each other.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:31.090
The nail will keep it from
falling.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.131
The nail will not keep it from
swinging, because the force of

00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.970
the nail acting as it does at
the pivot point is unable to

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.967
exert a torque,
whereas the minute you rotate

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:44.750
the body, mg is able to
exert a torque.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.946
That's why if you twist it,
it'll start rattling back and

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:47.260
forth.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.631
Alright.
So, what I'm going to do now is

00:10:54.631 --> 00:11:00.739
to go over more complicated
oscillations using some of the

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:06.549
techniques we learned last time.
So, here is the mega formula.

00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:07.899
I'm going to give it to you
guys.

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.140
You're allowed to tattoo it on
your face.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.083
You can carry it with you.
I will allow you to bring it

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.850
but you cannot forget this
formula.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.110
I think you know the formula
I'm driving at.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.953
Ready?
e to the ix,

00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:24.799
or θ,
I don't care.

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:30.519
Let me call it θ here,
is cos θ + I sin θ.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:33.980
That's a great formula from
Euler.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.098
From this formula,
if you take the complex

00:11:37.098 --> 00:11:40.672
conjugate of both sides,
that means change every

00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:45.848
i to minus i,
you will get e to the

00:11:45.848 --> 00:11:50.480
minus iθ is cos θ -
i sin θ.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.600
That also you should know.

00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:58.502
If you got this in your
head--By the way,

00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:01.560
this is something you're not
going to derive on the spot.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.279
It takes a lot of work.
If you tell me what are the few

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:07.939
things you really have to cram,
that you don't want to carry in

00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:10.299
your head, well,
this is one of them.

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:14.380
Okay, this is a formula worth
memorizing, unlike formula No.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.010
92 of your text.
It's not worth memorizing.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.360
This is worth memorizing.
Once you got this,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.646
you should realize that in any
expression involving complex

00:12:22.646 --> 00:12:24.694
numbers,
you can get another equation

00:12:24.694 --> 00:12:27.290
where every i is changed
to minus i.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.604
That'll give you this one.
That's called complex

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:32.498
conjugation.
I generally said,

00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:36.092
if you have a complex number
z, z star is equal

00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:39.085
to x - iy,
if z is equal to

00:12:39.085 --> 00:12:42.070
x plus Iy.
So, in our simple example,

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.154
this fellow here is z.
This is the x and this

00:12:46.154 --> 00:12:50.339
is the y.
Now, you should be able to

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:54.413
invert this formula.
To invert the formula,

00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:59.326
you add the 2 and divide by 2.
Then, you will find cos

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:03.950
θ is e^(iθ) +
e^(-iθ) over 2.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.296
If you subtract and divide by
2i, you will find sin

00:13:08.296 --> 00:13:12.570
θ is e^(iθ) -
e^(iθ) over 2i.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.114
In other words,
my claim is that this funny

00:13:15.114 --> 00:13:18.690
exponential, sum of exponential,
is the family of cosine.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.669
It'll do everything your cosine
will do.

00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:22.944
It'll oscillate,
sine squared plus cosine

00:13:22.944 --> 00:13:25.617
squared would be 1,
it'll obey all trigonometric

00:13:25.617 --> 00:13:28.051
identities,
like sine 2 θ is 2

00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:31.458
sin θ cos θ,
everything comes out of this

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:33.201
expression.
So, you should know,

00:13:33.201 --> 00:13:35.029
here is the main point you
should learn.

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:38.929
We don't need trigonometric
functions anymore.

00:13:38.929 --> 00:13:43.126
Once you got the exponential
function, provided you let the

00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:47.467
exponent be complex or imaginary
you don't need trigonometric

00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:50.282
functions.
This is one example of grand

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:52.455
unification.
People always say Maxwell

00:13:52.455 --> 00:13:54.592
unified this,
and Einstein tried to unify

00:13:54.592 --> 00:13:56.942
this.
Unification means things that

00:13:56.942 --> 00:14:00.123
you thought were unrelated are,
in fact, related,

00:14:00.123 --> 00:14:03.370
and there are different
manifestations of the same

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.456
thing.
When we first discovered

00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:08.339
trigonometric functions,
we were drawing right-angle

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:11.110
triangles and opposite side and
adjacent side.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.579
Then, we discovered the
exponential function which,

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:16.197
by the way, was computed by
bankers who were trying to

00:14:16.197 --> 00:14:18.419
calculate compound interest
every second.

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:21.278
The fact that those functions
are related is a marvelous

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:24.240
result, but it happens only if
you got complex numbers.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.960
So, this is another thing you
should know.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.231
Okay, now, armed with this we
are ready to do anything we

00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:33.865
want.
Let me just tell you that every

00:14:33.865 --> 00:14:37.625
complex number z can be
written as its absolute value

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.785
times some phase.
In other words,

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.972
if my complex number z
is here, it is x +

00:14:42.972 --> 00:14:45.049
iy;
that's one way to write it.

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:47.600
You can also write it as its
absolute value.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.378
It'll be e to the
iφ φr,

00:14:50.378 --> 00:14:53.765
re to the iφ.
r is the radial length

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:56.970
which also happens to be the
length of the complex number.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.250
That's called the polar form of
the complex number.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.100
x + iy is the Cartesian
form of the complex number.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.830
I may have called them r
and θ,

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.759
r and φ.
I just don't remember.

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:13.567
I'm going to use these symbols
back and forth because people do

00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:16.430
use both the symbols,
which is why I'm sometimes

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.664
calling this angle as θ
and sometimes this angle as

00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:21.909
φ,
but the basic idea is the same.

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:26.514
This entity here can do it
either in this form or in this

00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:29.033
form.
This is something you should

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:30.259
know.
If you don't know,

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:32.510
or you don't understand,
you should stop and ask.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:38.751
Everything is built on this.
So, what I'm going to do now is

00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:47.347
to go back to this rather simple
equation, d^(2)x/dt^(2) =

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:51.321
-ω^(2)x.
By the way, today I'm going to

00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:53.900
call this ω as
ω_0.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.175
It's the same guy.
I'm going to call it

00:15:57.175 --> 00:15:59.495
ω_0 because we
will find as the hour

00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:02.340
progresses, there are going to
be many ωs in the game.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.080
Two more ωs are going
to come in.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.289
So, we've got to be able to
tell them apart.

00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:07.913
As long as there's only one
ω in town,

00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:10.080
you just call it ω.
If there are many,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.696
you call this
ω_0 to mean

00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:16.432
it's the frequency of vibration
of the system left to its own

00:16:16.432 --> 00:16:18.240
design,
and you pull it and let it go.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.984
What's the frequency?
An angular frequency,

00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:21.980
that's what we call
ω_0.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.960
Now, how did we solve this
equation?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.620
The way I tried to solve it for
you is to say,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.619
turn it into a word problem.
I'm looking for a function,

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:34.738
x(t) with a property
that two derivatives of the

00:16:34.738 --> 00:16:37.539
function look like the function,
and we rake our brains

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.566
[inaudible]
and we remembered,

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:40.090
hey, sines and cosines are the
property.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.409
One derivative is no good.
Turn sign into cosine.

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:47.081
Two derivatives bring back the
function you started with,

00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:50.490
which is why the answer could
be sines or cosines.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.320
But now I'm going to solve with
a different way.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.891
My thinking is going to be:
I know a function that repeats

00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:01.340
itself, even when it
differentiated once.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.720
Namely, the function has a
property;

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.990
its first derivative looks like
the function itself.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.975
It's obvious that his 90-second
derivative will also look like

00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:12.960
the function because taking the
derivative leaves the function

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.657
alone,
except for pulling out some

00:17:14.657 --> 00:17:16.450
numbers.
So, why not say,

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:21.576
"I want an answer that looks
like this: x equals some

00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:25.528
A to the αt."
That certainly has a property

00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:28.304
that if you take two derivatives
it's going to look like e

00:17:28.304 --> 00:17:30.170
to the αt on the
left-hand side,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.940
and e to the αt
on the right-hand side,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.710
and then you can cancel them
and you've got yourself a

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.993
solution.
Do you guys remember why I

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:43.800
didn't follow this solution for
the oscillator?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.019
Why was it rejected?
Yes?

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:48.755
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:50.829
Shankar: Ah.
That's a very good point.

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:53.480
So, maybe I will take e
to the minus αt.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.076
How about that?
Will that give me a second

00:17:56.076 --> 00:18:00.980
derivative which is negative?
You didn't fall for that, right?

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.523
Because the first time you'll
get -α but second time

00:18:03.523 --> 00:18:05.450
you'll get +α^(2).
That's correct.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.930
So, this function is no good.
Also, it doesn't look like what

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.548
I want.
Even without doing much

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.271
mathematical physics,
I know if you pull this spring

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:16.279
it's going to go back and forth,
whereas these functions are

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:18.789
exponentially growing;
they're exponentially falling,

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:21.925
they just don't do the trick.
But now, we'll find that if

00:18:21.925 --> 00:18:24.761
you're willing to work with
complex exponentials,

00:18:24.761 --> 00:18:28.047
this will do the job.
So, we're just going to take

00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:32.049
this guess and put it in the
equation and see if I can get an

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:33.850
answer that works,
okay?

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.101
This is called an ansatz.
Ansatz are something we

00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:38.730
use all the time.
It's a German word.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.417
I'm not sure exactly what it
means, but we all use it to mean

00:18:43.417 --> 00:18:46.160
a tentative guess.
That's what it is.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.157
If you're lucky, it'll work.
If you're not lucky,

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:51.081
that's fine.
You move on and try another

00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:52.842
solution.
So, we're going to say,

00:18:52.842 --> 00:18:56.147
"Can a solution of this form be
found, with A and

00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:59.260
α completely free?"
Maybe the equation will tell me

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.910
what A and α
should be.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:05.106
So, let's take it, put it here.
By the way, I'm going to write

00:19:05.106 --> 00:19:07.980
this equation in a form that's a
little easier.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.814
x double dot is minus
ω_0^(2)x but

00:19:11.814 --> 00:19:15.796
each dot is a derivative.
It's just more compact that way

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:18.630
rather than to write all of this
stuff.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.890
So, let's take that guess and
put it here and see what we get.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.634
I get, when I take two
derivatives, you can say,

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:32.015
"Do I want e to the
αt or e to the

00:19:32.015 --> 00:19:34.993
-αt,"
you'll find it doesn't matter

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:38.519
so I'm going to take e to
the αt and put it in.

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:42.163
Now, the beauty of the x
function now is to take one

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:45.259
derivative, x dot.
I hope everybody knows the

00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:47.628
x dot of this is,
A [α]

00:19:47.628 --> 00:19:50.481
e to the αt,
and x double dot is

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.887
another α.
Aα^(2)e to the

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:56.094
αt.
That's the beauty of the

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:59.015
exponential.
The act of differentiation is

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:01.206
trivial.
You just multiply it by the

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:04.711
exponent, α.
See, this being the result of

00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:08.800
taking two derivatives,
let me write it here now.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.560
What do I get?

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.438
So, I'm going to go to x
double dot equal to minus

00:20:16.438 --> 00:20:18.809
ω_0 squared
x.

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:22.671
Into that, I'm going to put in
the guess, x equals

00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:26.120
Ae to the αt,
and what do I find?

00:20:29.349 --> 00:20:32.495
In fact, let me write the
equation in a nicer way:

00:20:32.495 --> 00:20:35.896
x double dot plus
ω_0 squared

00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:40.267
x has to vanish.
I just brought everything to

00:20:40.267 --> 00:20:42.625
one side.
Now, put e^(αt),

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:46.106
A to the αt as
your guess, then you find that

00:20:46.106 --> 00:20:49.086
α^(2),
Ae^(α)t,

00:20:49.086 --> 00:20:56.001
plus ω_0
squared Ae^(αt) has to

00:20:56.001 --> 00:21:00.220
be 0.
So, we know what to do.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.776
Let's group a few terms.
So, this means I get A

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:10.799
times α^(2) + 1,
e^(αt) has to vanish.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:14.812
If you can make that happen,
you got a solution because

00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:18.456
you've satisfied the equation.
No one's going to say,

00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:21.571
well, you got it by guesswork.
Well, it turns out solving

00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.670
differential equation is only
guesswork.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.610
There's no other way to solve
the equation other than to make

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.963
a guess, stick it in,
fiddle with the parameters,

00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:31.723
see if it will work.
So, we're not done yet because

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:35.695
we want this to vanish.
How many ways are there to kill

00:21:35.695 --> 00:21:38.790
this answer?
You can say maybe A is 0.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.696
A is 0;
you've got what you call a

00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:42.299
trivial solution.
Yes?

00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:44.729
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:21:44.729 --> 00:21:45.870
Shankar: Ah,
yes.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.020
Thank you.
Yep.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:53.943
Thank you very much.
So, this one is α^(2) +

00:21:53.943 --> 00:21:59.690
ω_0^(2).
Does everybody follow that?

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.220
Yes, from here to here it's
very clear what to do.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.450
So, we cannot kill A.
Yep?

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.640
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.029
Shankar: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:16.789
I'm trying to rule out certain
options I don't like.

00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:21.149
The option I don't like to get
this to be 0 is to say that is

00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:22.730
0.
That's not happening.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.240
e^(α)t is not going to
vanish.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.625
Maybe it'll vanish for some
negative infinity time,

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:31.470
but I want this to be true at
all times.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.413
The equation has to be obeyed
at all times,

00:22:33.413 --> 00:22:35.680
so this guy certainly is not
zero at all times,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.757
so the only way to fix that is
to have α^(2) +

00:22:39.757 --> 00:22:43.307
ω_0^(2) = 0.
That's the only solution,

00:22:43.307 --> 00:22:44.810
which is not a trivial
solution.

00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.309
Well, that's a simple equation,
right?

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:53.726
It's a quadratic equation that
means α^(2) =

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:57.453
ω_0^(2),
or α is plus or minus

00:22:57.453 --> 00:22:59.550
iω_0.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:08.337
So, when we were young and we
didn't know about complex

00:23:08.337 --> 00:23:11.380
numbers, we would come to this
stage and we would quit and say,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.200
"Look, exponentials won't work,
but now we are not afraid of

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.320
complex exponentials,
so we embrace the solution."

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.005
So now, I've got two solutions.
By the way, what's the value of

00:23:21.005 --> 00:23:23.710
A?
Think about this.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.156
If this condition is satisfied,
you realize A can be

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:31.509
whatever you like.
A is completely

00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:34.989
arbitrary.
So, what this equation has told

00:23:34.989 --> 00:23:38.612
me is the following.
Yes, there are solutions of

00:23:38.612 --> 00:23:40.925
this form.
For A you can pick any

00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:43.110
number you like,
in fact, real or complex,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.579
it doesn't matter.
The equation is satisfied.

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:48.730
But your α is not an
arbitrary number.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.415
It can be only one of two
numbers: +iω_0

00:23:52.415 --> 00:23:56.254
or -iω_0.
So, we've got a problem now

00:23:56.254 --> 00:23:59.020
that I look at one answer,
I got two.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.206
So, I will write them both.
So, let's say that the solution

00:24:02.206 --> 00:24:05.381
x_1 of
t, which is some number

00:24:05.381 --> 00:24:07.292
A,
e to the

00:24:07.292 --> 00:24:11.347
iω_0t,
then I got another solution

00:24:11.347 --> 00:24:14.210
x_2 of
t,

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.640
which is equal to any other
number B,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.070
e to the
-iω_0t.

00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:29.597
Now, I think you guys can see
in your head that if you take

00:24:29.597 --> 00:24:32.210
this and you put it in the
equation,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.812
it works, and if you take this
and put it in the equation,

00:24:35.812 --> 00:24:38.313
that also works.
Because when you take two

00:24:38.313 --> 00:24:41.584
derivatives, iω whole
square would be minus ω

00:24:41.584 --> 00:24:43.324
square,
minus iω_0

00:24:43.324 --> 00:24:45.670
whole square would also be minus
ω not square,

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.558
so both would work.
Now, we have to ask,

00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:54.859
"How do I decide between that
solution and that solution?"

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:58.720
It turns out that we don't have
to pick.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.445
We can pick both,
and I'll tell you what I mean

00:25:02.445 --> 00:25:05.282
by "we can pick both."
Now, this is a very,

00:25:05.282 --> 00:25:07.780
very important property for all
of you who are going into

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.609
economics or engineering or
chemistry.

00:25:09.609 --> 00:25:12.610
This or other disciplines,
which are mathematical,

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.101
the property I'm going to
mention of this equation is very

00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:18.490
important, so please pay
attention.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.600
This is called a linear
equation.

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:28.077
A linear equation will obey a
certain property called

00:25:28.077 --> 00:25:30.986
superposition.
I'll have to tell you what it

00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:32.955
is.
If I give you differential

00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:35.925
equation, you know,
96 derivative of x,

00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:40.082
plus 52 times the 37 derivative
of x, blah blah blah adds

00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:43.541
up to 0;
what makes it a linear equation

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:48.578
is that throughout the equation,
either you find the function

00:25:48.578 --> 00:25:52.642
x or its derivatives,
but never the squares of cubes

00:25:52.642 --> 00:25:55.030
at higher powers of x or
the derivatives.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.623
Okay?
The function appears to first

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:01.511
power, not to second power.
For example,

00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:04.516
if this were the equation you
were trying to solve,

00:26:04.516 --> 00:26:07.670
that is not a linear equation.
That's called a non-linear

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.802
equation.
If you have a linear equation,

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:12.270
there's a very,
very profound consequence and

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.289
I'm going to tell you what it
is,

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:17.059
and that lies at the heart of
so many things we do.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:21.380
So, let me write down two
solutions.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.328
One of them will be
x_1 double dot

00:26:24.328 --> 00:26:27.160
+ ω_0
^(2)x_1 = 0.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.905
Second one obeys
x_2 double dot

00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:32.710
+ ω_0^(2)x
_2 = 0.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.490
Don't even have to look at
these two solutions.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.141
Take a general problem where
you have a linear equation that

00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:41.660
are two solutions.
Add the two equations.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.864
On the left-hand side,
I get a second derivative of

00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:47.877
x_1 plus a
second derivative of

00:26:47.877 --> 00:26:50.609
x_2,
and remember that is,

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:53.736
in fact, the second derivative.
Now, I go back to the old

00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:56.549
notation of x_1 +
x_2.

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:59.417
This has to do with the fact
the derivative of a sum is the

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:01.988
sum of the derivatives,
and the sum of the derivative

00:27:01.988 --> 00:27:04.549
is the derivative of the sum.
Yep?

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:06.607
Student: So,
because you have these two

00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:08.802
linear solutions,
does that mean you can generate

00:27:08.802 --> 00:27:10.266
an infinite number of
[inaudible]

00:27:10.266 --> 00:27:12.370
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.613
I'm coming to that in a minute.
I'm first doing a more modest

00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:18.680
goal of showing that their sum
is also a solution.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.190
In the second term,
I get ω_0

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.540
squared times x_1 +
x_2 = 0.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.008
You stare at this equation.
Look, this plus this implies

00:27:31.008 --> 00:27:33.569
what I've written down simply by
adding.

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:36.059
But say in words what you found
out.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:38.448
What you found out,
is that if x_1

00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:40.980
satisfies the equation,
x_2 satisfies

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.559
the equation x_1 +
x_2,

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:46.592
let's call it x plus,
is x_1 +

00:27:46.592 --> 00:27:49.509
x_2 also
satisfies the equation,

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:51.569
and the proof is right in front
of you.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:55.329
And the key was the derivative
of a sum is the sum of the

00:27:55.329 --> 00:27:58.714
derivatives.
Now, I'm going to generalize it

00:27:58.714 --> 00:28:02.184
more and say,
suppose I multiplied all of the

00:28:02.184 --> 00:28:06.679
first equation by A,
and all of the second equation

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:09.440
by B.
Well, that's certainly still

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.658
true, right?
You take something equal to 0,

00:28:11.658 --> 00:28:14.359
multiply both sides by A,
it's still going to be 0.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:18.077
Now, imagine adding this to
this [adding the two equations

00:28:18.077 --> 00:28:20.081
together].
Add this to this,

00:28:20.081 --> 00:28:22.769
and what do you get?
You will find

00:28:22.769 --> 00:28:26.851
d^(2)/dt^(2) of
Ax_1 +

00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:31.660
Bx_2 +
ω_0^(2),

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:37.980
Ax_1 +
Bx_2 is 0.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.737
So, here is the punch line.
If you give me two solutions to

00:28:42.737 --> 00:28:45.327
this equation,
I can manufacture another one

00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:48.400
by taking the first one times
any number I like,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.200
plus the second one times any
other number I like.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.650
So, the story is a lot more
complicated than it looked.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.579
It looked like there are two
solutions;

00:28:57.579 --> 00:29:00.248
actually, there's infinite
number of solutions because you

00:29:00.248 --> 00:29:02.589
can pick A and B
any way you like.

00:29:02.589 --> 00:29:05.787
So, linear equations typically
have infinite number of

00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:09.769
solutions and you build them up
by taking a few building blocks.

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:12.680
They're like unit vectors
I and J.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.225
You can take any multiple of
this unit, vector any multiple

00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:17.420
of that unit vector,
and this combination will also

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.430
solve the equation.

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:24.342
Just so you don't think this is
going to happen all the time,

00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:26.289
let me remind you.
You don't have to write this

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:27.970
down but you guys follow what
I'm saying.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.350
Suppose this quantity here was
not x_1 but the

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.640
square of x_1
and here.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.209
Okay.
You don't have to write this

00:29:35.209 --> 00:29:36.490
because this is not a linear
equation.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.853
We're not interested in this.
But notice this is non-linear,

00:29:38.853 --> 00:29:40.849
and you guys should be able to
pick it up.

00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:43.190
It's non-linear because I've
got the square of the unknown.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.983
Now, can you see if I add these
two equations,

00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:49.150
forget A and B,
let them both be 1.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.820
I get x_1
squared plus

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.686
x_2 squared,
but that does not equal to

00:29:55.686 --> 00:29:59.060
x_1 +
x_2,

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.048
the whole thing square.
So, even though the second

00:30:02.048 --> 00:30:05.006
derivative of the sum is the sum
of the second derivative,

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:07.859
the sum of the squares is not
the square of the sum.

00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:10.836
So, for a non-linear equation
you cannot add solutions,

00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:13.811
but for linear equations you
can combine solutions with

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:17.735
arbitrary coefficients.
That's the lesson you have

00:30:17.735 --> 00:30:21.084
learned today.
So, harmonic oscillating

00:30:21.084 --> 00:30:25.784
equation is a linear equation,
so feel free to combine them

00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:30.890
and get the following solution:
x(t) is equal to Ae^(iω0) ,

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:36.666
plus B e^(-iω0t).
A and B are whatever you like,

00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:41.290
but ω_0 is
the original root of k/m.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.645
But if I gave you this
solution, will you be happy to

00:30:51.645 --> 00:30:54.586
take it as a solution for the
mass spring system,

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.160
and if not, what is it you
don't like?

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.279
Yes?
Anybody have a view?

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.180
I mean, would you take that as
a good solution?

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.816
Yes?
Student: Wouldn't you

00:31:08.816 --> 00:31:12.839
need to figure out how to choose
the right A and B?

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:14.052
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: In order to achieve

00:31:14.052 --> 00:31:16.266
what?
Student: Because your

00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:19.351
system starts at some amplitude
[inaudible]

00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:22.290
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Well,

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.529
he's raising a point.
Let me repeat his point.

00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:28.670
A and B in
general--they are arbitrary.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.004
For this mass and this spring
you can pick any A and

00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:32.957
B you like.
But on a given day,

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:35.857
when you pull it by 9
centimeters and release it,

00:31:35.857 --> 00:31:39.240
the answer has to be chosen so
that our t = 0,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.224
x becomes 9,
and the velocity,

00:31:41.224 --> 00:31:43.430
let's say, was 0 when you
released it,

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.166
so when you take the derivative
of this, the velocity should

00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:49.820
vanish at t = 0.
Or maybe it will have some

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.938
other velocity.
But you can fit initial

00:31:51.938 --> 00:31:54.791
coordinate, initial velocity,
the two numbers,

00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:58.030
by picking these two numbers.
You understand that.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.360
But that's not enough.
I've got another problem.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.211
Yes?
Student: It has

00:32:05.211 --> 00:32:06.280
imaginary numbers in it?
Professor Ramamurti

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.160
Shankar: Yes.
That should bother you.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.017
The answer is manifestly not
real, okay, and we know x

00:32:13.017 --> 00:32:16.717
is the real function.
That is not a mathematical

00:32:16.717 --> 00:32:20.888
requirement of the equation,
but a physical requirement that

00:32:20.888 --> 00:32:25.130
when you pull a mass by 9
centimeters and you release it,

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.810
it's going to oscillate with
some real x and not a

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.930
complex x,
so you've got to fix that.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:34.750
So, to say that x is
real really means the following.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:38.013
You remember that in a
complex--world of complex

00:32:38.013 --> 00:32:42.318
numbers, a complex number x +
iy has a complex conjugate

00:32:42.318 --> 00:32:45.859
x - iy and the property
of real numbers,

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:48.746
is that when you take the
complex conjugate,

00:32:48.746 --> 00:32:52.640
nothing happens because
i goes to minus i.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.701
If the number was purely real,
it satisfies the condition

00:32:56.701 --> 00:33:01.329
z = z star.
So, real numbers are their own

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:04.511
complex conjugates.
In general, a complex number is

00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:06.771
not its own conjugate,
but if you wanted me to draw

00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:08.825
you a picture,
that's where the z is,

00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:11.309
and that's where the z
star is, but fellows on the

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:12.950
x axis have the
properties,

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.089
z is the same as
z star.

00:33:15.089 --> 00:33:18.090
z star is a reflection
of the x axis of

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.744
z, and therefore,
if the number is real,

00:33:20.744 --> 00:33:24.379
it's its own reflection.
So, I'm going to demand that

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:27.481
this solution,
in addition to satisfying the

00:33:27.481 --> 00:33:29.789
basic equation,
also is real.

00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:32.970
To do that, I'm going to find
the complex conjugate.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.390
It's denoted by the x
star of t.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.549
I want to conjugate everything
in sight.

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.724
The complex conjugate of
A I'm going to call

00:33:41.724 --> 00:33:45.659
A star.
Complex conjugate of e^(iωt)

00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:47.980
is e^(-iω0t).
Why?

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.473
Because the i goes to
minus i,

00:33:49.473 --> 00:33:51.350
ω_0 and
t are real numbers.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.581
Nothing happens to them.
And B becomes B

00:33:54.581 --> 00:33:57.101
star and this becomes e
to the plus

00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:00.409
iω_0t.
And I demand that these two

00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:01.570
fellows are equal.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.456
If they are both equal,
then I take this exponential

00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:13.969
and demand that those be the
same.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:17.488
That means I demand that
A be the same as B

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:21.070
star, because if A is the
same as B star,

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.420
this will go into this,
and then I will demand that

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.099
B is the same as A
star.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.648
If these conditions are
satisfied, x star will

00:34:29.648 --> 00:34:30.530
become x.

00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:38.137
So, the trick is to take the
function, take its complex

00:34:38.137 --> 00:34:41.119
conjugate, equate it to itself,
and look at the consequence.

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:43.405
Now, I want to tell you that if
A = B star,

00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:45.737
then you don't have to worry
about this as an extra

00:34:45.737 --> 00:34:47.710
condition,
because I'm your complex

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.010
conjugate, you are my complex
conjugate, but the way it works

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.199
is if you took A and
changed every i to minus

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.571
i,
right, or if you took B,

00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:59.361
whatever its complex form was,
change i to minus

00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:02.346
i you get A.
But if you do it one more time,

00:35:02.346 --> 00:35:04.726
you come back to where you are.
In other words,

00:35:04.726 --> 00:35:07.715
for any complex number,
if you star it and you star it

00:35:07.715 --> 00:35:10.480
one more time,
you come back to where you are.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.231
Therefore, if A = B
star, take the complex conjugate

00:35:13.231 --> 00:35:15.952
of the left-hand side,
you'll find A star is

00:35:15.952 --> 00:35:18.610
equal to B star star
which is B.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.380
So, you don't need these two
conditions.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.430
You do need A = B
star.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.309
Okay, so you have to put that
extra condition now.

00:35:29.309 --> 00:35:34.377
So, in the real world,
for people who want a real

00:35:34.377 --> 00:35:40.605
answer, you want to write it as
Ae^(iω0t) + A

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.813
star e^(-iωt).
In other words,

00:35:43.813 --> 00:35:45.019
B is not an independent
number.

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:47.070
B has to be the complex
conjugate of A.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.234
Then, all of you can see at a
glance that this is now real,

00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.090
because whatever this animal
is,

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.652
this is the complex conjugate
of that, which got all the

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.469
is turned into minus
i.

00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:58.700
When you add them,
all the is will cancel;

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.988
answer will be real.
But A is not necessarily

00:36:02.988 --> 00:36:05.774
real.
The complex number A,

00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:10.334
which is some complex number,
has a length and it can have a

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.253
phase,
because every complex number

00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:16.573
can be written in this form.
So, if you remember that,

00:36:16.573 --> 00:36:21.824
then you find x looks like
absolute value of

00:36:21.824 --> 00:36:28.175
Ae^(iω0t) p+ φ
plus absolute value of

00:36:28.175 --> 00:36:32.450
Ae^(-iωt) + φ.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:43.192
Well, maybe that's too fast for
you, so let me repeat what I

00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:45.012
did.
In the place of A,

00:36:45.012 --> 00:36:47.949
write the absolute value times
e^(iφ).

00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:51.215
e^(iφ) will combine it
e^(iωt) and form this

00:36:51.215 --> 00:36:53.480
exponential.
Second term will be just a

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.570
conjugate of the whole thing.
You don't even have to think.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.720
Now, what is this function I
have?

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.615
I want you to think about it.
Do you recognize this creature

00:37:06.615 --> 00:37:11.720
here as something familiar?
Yes?

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.780
Do you have any idea?
Yeah?

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.352
Yep?
Student: [inaudible]

00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:19.072
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Without the

00:37:19.072 --> 00:37:21.536
A.
Student: [inaudible]

00:37:21.536 --> 00:37:25.922
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You remember this

00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:28.060
great identity.
Where is it?

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.730
Here?
This one.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:36.969
e^(iθ) + e^(-iθ) is 2
times cos θ.

00:37:36.969 --> 00:37:43.289
So, this becomes 2 times
absolute value of A cos ωt +

00:37:43.289 --> 00:37:49.721
φ, and if you want you can
call 2 A as another

00:37:49.721 --> 00:37:54.800
number C cos ω_0t
+ φ.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:02.098
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:38:02.098 --> 00:38:08.949
Shankar: Oh,
but for any complex number.

00:38:08.949 --> 00:38:11.039
You can pull certainly this
number out of both.

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.595
You pull it out and you got
e to the i

00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:16.151
something plus either the minus
i something--

00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:18.607
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:38:18.607 --> 00:38:21.185
Shankar: So,
this is a long and difficult

00:38:21.185 --> 00:38:23.030
way to get back to the old
answer.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.068
You got this by filling it out
and guessing and arguing

00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:27.893
physically.
But I want to show you that

00:38:27.893 --> 00:38:30.161
with an exponential function,
you would have come to this

00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:32.795
answer anyway.
So, your point of view is,

00:38:32.795 --> 00:38:36.522
you know, we don't need this.
We've got enough problems in

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:39.276
life;
we're doing well with cosines,

00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:41.157
thank you.
Why do you bring this

00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:43.585
exponential on us?
Well, now I'm going to give you

00:38:43.585 --> 00:38:46.506
a problem where you cannot talk
your way out of this by just

00:38:46.506 --> 00:38:49.664
turning it into a word problem.
The word problem I meant,

00:38:49.664 --> 00:38:52.789
we asked a word question,
find me a function where the

00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:55.090
second derivative looks like
itself,

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.064
and you can either start at
exponentials and differentiate

00:38:58.064 --> 00:39:00.789
twice, or sines and cosines.
So, you don't need exponentials.

00:39:00.789 --> 00:39:02.170
But look at the following
problem.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:06.623
This is a problem of a mass
m, force constant

00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:10.640
k, moving on a surface
with friction.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.730
The minute you got friction,
you have an extra force.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:19.520
So you find m,
x double dot equal to

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.026
minus kx,
which would be all the force

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:25.308
due to the spring.
Friction also exerts a force

00:39:25.308 --> 00:39:29.800
which has got some coefficient
b, but it's multiplied by

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.254
the velocity.
We know that if you're moving

00:39:32.254 --> 00:39:34.128
to the right,
the force of the left you are

00:39:34.128 --> 00:39:36.269
moving to the left the force is
to the right,

00:39:36.269 --> 00:39:38.250
frictional force is velocity
dependent.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:44.615
So, the equation you want to
solve, when you've got friction,

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:50.237
is really mx double dot
plus bx dot plus

00:39:50.237 --> 00:39:55.234
kx equal to 0.
I'm going to divide everything

00:39:55.234 --> 00:39:58.199
by m.
Take the m,

00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:01.449
put it here,
and put it here.

00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:06.473
Then, I'm going to rewrite for
us the equation we want to solve

00:40:06.473 --> 00:40:09.696
with friction.
x double dot,

00:40:09.696 --> 00:40:14.128
plus γx dot,
plus ω_0

00:40:14.128 --> 00:40:19.041
squared x = 0,
where γ is just b over

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:21.523
x.
So, this is the equation you

00:40:21.523 --> 00:40:22.130
want to solve.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.989
Can you solve this by your
usual word problem?

00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:33.897
It's going to be difficult,
because you want a function

00:40:33.897 --> 00:40:35.889
which, when I take two
derivatives,

00:40:35.889 --> 00:40:40.089
it looks like the function plus
some amount of its own

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:43.166
derivative.
If you take cos ωt,

00:40:43.166 --> 00:40:45.573
it won't do it.
If you take sin ωt,

00:40:45.573 --> 00:40:46.280
it won't do it.

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:55.162
So, we can still solve it
because even this equation,

00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:59.050
you solve by the same mindless
approach,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.315
which is to say,
let x look like

00:41:01.315 --> 00:41:03.700
A, Ae to the
αt,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.860
and it'll work.
Let's see how it'll work.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.719
It has to work.
You can see why because when I

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:12.918
take two derivatives of
x, I'll get

00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:16.264
α^(2).
Let me pull the A out of

00:41:16.264 --> 00:41:20.819
everything plus αγ plus
ω_0^(2),

00:41:20.819 --> 00:41:23.490
e to the αt = 0.

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:35.875
So, what we learn is yes,
there are solutions of this

00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:39.764
form to this equation.
Once again, A can be

00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:42.501
whatever number you like,
because if A vanishes

00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:44.360
you've killed the whole
solution.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.760
e to the αt is
not going to vanish at every

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.503
instant in time,
so the only way is for this to

00:41:50.503 --> 00:41:52.974
vanish.
That means α that you

00:41:52.974 --> 00:41:56.790
put into this guess is not any
old number, but the solution to

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.739
this quadratic equation,
α^(2) + αγ +

00:41:59.739 --> 00:42:01.700
ω_0^(2) = 0.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:09.390
So, we want α^(2) +
αγ not square is

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.881
ω_0^(2) = 0.
So, α must be the root

00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:16.566
of this equation,
and we all know a quadratic

00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:20.488
equation will have two roots,
and we will get two solutions,

00:42:20.488 --> 00:42:23.770
and we can add them with any
coefficient we like.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.519
That'll also be a solution.
So, let me write it down.

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:30.594
So, in other words,
I'm going to explicitly solve

00:42:30.594 --> 00:42:35.018
this quadratic equation.
So, go back to the old days and

00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:40.356
remember that the solution of
that equation will be α

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:44.320
= -γ,
plus or minus square root of

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.312
γ^(2) -
4ω_0 square

00:42:48.312 --> 00:42:52.159
over 2.
I would like to rewrite this as

00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:56.995
minus γ over 2,
plus or minus square root of

00:42:56.995 --> 00:43:01.832
γ over 2 square,
minus ω_0

00:43:01.832 --> 00:43:05.448
square.
And let's call the two roots,

00:43:05.448 --> 00:43:09.380
one with a plus sign and one
with a minus sign,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.471
as α plus and minus.
This is a shorthand for this

00:43:13.471 --> 00:43:14.450
whole combination.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.576
You understand that if I give
you the mass and the spring

00:43:20.576 --> 00:43:23.510
constant, and I give you the
coefficient of friction,

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.057
the number b,
α plus and α

00:43:26.057 --> 00:43:28.988
minus are uniquely known,
so you'll get two precise

00:43:28.988 --> 00:43:32.643
numbers coming out of this whole
game, and your answer then to

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:36.419
this problem will be x of
t is any number A

00:43:36.419 --> 00:43:39.955
times e to the minus
α plus t with any

00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:43.431
number B times e
to the minus α minus

00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:45.564
t,
where α plus or minus

00:43:45.564 --> 00:43:46.400
are these two numbers.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.379
I want you to notice both
numbers are falling

00:43:55.379 --> 00:43:57.882
exponentials.
Very important,

00:43:57.882 --> 00:44:02.480
because now I'm talking about a
mass where I pull the spring,

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.103
there's a lot of friction,
and I let it go,

00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:08.040
I don't want an exponentially
growing answer.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.329
That makes no sense.
The x should eventually

00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:13.849
vanish and that will,
in fact, happen.

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:15.640
Let's make sure you understand
that.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.208
Look at these two roots.
Minus γ over 2,

00:44:19.208 --> 00:44:23.023
plus and minus,
well, that is this solution

00:44:23.023 --> 00:44:28.200
minus γ over 2 square,
minus ω_0

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.010
square.
I'm going to assume in this

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.006
calculation that γ over
2 is bigger than

00:44:34.006 --> 00:44:36.430
ω_0.
Let's do that first.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.444
Then, you can see that that's a
negative number,

00:44:41.444 --> 00:44:43.750
that's a negative number,
the whole thing is negative,

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:51.369
so α minus is
definitely, let me see how I

00:44:51.369 --> 00:44:53.772
wrote it.
Oh, I'm sorry,

00:44:53.772 --> 00:44:57.410
I made a mistake here.
I think these are called just

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:02.067
plus and minus α,
α has two roots and I

00:45:02.067 --> 00:45:05.380
have to write them as they are.
Okay.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.704
I'm sorry.
So please remove this,

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:10.415
I put unwanted sign there.
Because they are the two

00:45:10.415 --> 00:45:12.735
answers for α.
So, I put e to the

00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:16.140
α plus t.
So again, I should change my

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.900
answer here.
I'm really sorry about this one.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.591
Now, I'm going to write it
below so you have a second

00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:24.250
chance.
So, here is what it looks like.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.585
Ae to the minus
γ over 2,

00:45:28.585 --> 00:45:33.699
plus square root of γ
over 2 square,

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:37.706
minus ω_0
square t,

00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:43.203
plus Be to the minus
γ over 2 minus γ

00:45:43.203 --> 00:45:47.582
over 2 square minus
ω_0 square

00:45:47.582 --> 00:45:50.577
t.
Student: You forgot the

00:45:50.577 --> 00:45:51.270
minus.
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.651
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student:

00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:55.976
You forgot the minus in.
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:55.976 --> 00:45:58.750
Shankar: I think I did mean
this.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:03.944
Or did I get it wrong?
These are the two values of

00:46:03.944 --> 00:46:06.950
α.
So, they both have the first

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.073
number to be minus γ
over 2, and the square root

00:46:10.073 --> 00:46:13.538
comes for the plus sign for one
of them and minus sign for the

00:46:13.538 --> 00:46:15.396
other one.
I probably have A and

00:46:15.396 --> 00:46:17.200
B mixed up.
Let me check that.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.970
No, I think even that's okay.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.149
Yes?
I'm willing to be corrected if

00:46:30.149 --> 00:46:31.720
I got A and B
mixed up.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.191
I know these are correct.
I want to make sure this is

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.596
what I call B.
B has a coefficient

00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:38.820
α minus,
which would be this one.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.998
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:46:41.998 --> 00:46:43.490
Shankar: Oh,
yes.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.187
Yes.
So, what should I do,

00:46:46.187 --> 00:46:49.490
call this A?
Call this B?

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.889
How is that now?
Let's see if that works out.

00:46:52.889 --> 00:46:56.880
This should be Be to the
α minus t.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.440
B over the minus
γ over 2 minus that.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.659
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:47:06.659 --> 00:47:10.610
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:16.866
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:20.901
Shankar: Okay.
The point of writing it this

00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:23.071
way is to show you that both
these powers,

00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:26.035
this is clearly a positive
number so it's e to the

00:47:26.035 --> 00:47:28.910
minus a negative number.
I just want to show you that

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.159
this object--that's all I wanted
to emphasize.

00:47:31.159 --> 00:47:34.930
Inside the square brackets is
also positive.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.925
Okay, this is γ over 2.
You can see this is a number

00:47:37.925 --> 00:47:39.860
smaller than γ over 2
square.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.814
So, if you take the square root
of that number,

00:47:41.814 --> 00:47:44.447
it'll be smaller than γ
over 2, so this cannot overturn

00:47:44.447 --> 00:47:46.625
the sign of this.
It'll still be a positive over

00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:49.362
all signs to be negative;
so, if you draw the picture

00:47:49.362 --> 00:47:51.526
here, it's a sum of two
exponentials,

00:47:51.526 --> 00:47:53.750
it'll just die down after a
while.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:59.579
And how do I find A and
B?

00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:03.492
To find A and B,
what I have to do is to take

00:48:03.492 --> 00:48:06.663
extra data, one of them may be
initial position,

00:48:06.663 --> 00:48:11.319
x of 0 is given to me.
If x of 0 is given to me

00:48:11.319 --> 00:48:14.062
as some number,
I take the solution,

00:48:14.062 --> 00:48:17.590
I put t = 0 and have it
match this.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.036
If I put t = 0,
well all this exponential will

00:48:21.036 --> 00:48:25.013
vanish and I just get A +
B, because e to the 0

00:48:25.013 --> 00:48:27.085
is 1.
So, I already have one

00:48:27.085 --> 00:48:29.500
condition on A and
B.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.590
Their sum must be the initial
position.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.739
How about their initial
velocity?

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:40.280
Go back to this x and
take dx/dt.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.150
What do you get?
dx/dt is α plus

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.159
A, e to the
α plus t,

00:48:46.159 --> 00:48:49.820
plus α minus B,
e to the α minus

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.363
t.
The derivative of my answer is

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:56.760
this.
Evaluate it at t = 0.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.701
At t = 0,
you put t = 0 here,

00:49:01.701 --> 00:49:07.583
you find x dot of 0,
equal to α plus

00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:12.760
A, plus α minus
B.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.148
So, here are the two equations
you need to find A and

00:49:16.148 --> 00:49:18.553
B.
Solve these two simultaneous

00:49:18.553 --> 00:49:20.114
equations.
In other words,

00:49:20.114 --> 00:49:23.516
I will tell you the initial
position and I will tell you the

00:49:23.516 --> 00:49:27.454
initial velocity.
You will take then this number,

00:49:27.454 --> 00:49:31.332
known, and that number known.
This is a linear simultaneous

00:49:31.332 --> 00:49:32.800
equation for A and
B.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.960
You will fiddle around and
solve for A.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.313
Yes?
Student: Are A

00:49:38.313 --> 00:49:39.630
and B still complex
numbers?

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:40.280
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.809
Now, we have to ask the
following question.

00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:45.478
In this problem,
if everything is real--See

00:49:45.478 --> 00:49:49.932
previously, what happened is
when I took the complex

00:49:49.932 --> 00:49:54.282
conjugate of this function,
the conjugate turned into the

00:49:54.282 --> 00:49:56.547
other function,
and the conjugate of that

00:49:56.547 --> 00:49:58.699
function turned back into this
one.

00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:00.242
That's why A and
B were related,

00:50:00.242 --> 00:50:02.589
by complex conjugation.
Here, if I take the complex

00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:05.457
conjugate of x,
e to the α plus

00:50:05.457 --> 00:50:07.940
t, if it's real,
it remains itself.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.541
So, A just goes into
A star,

00:50:09.541 --> 00:50:11.845
B goes into B
star, and you want the answer to

00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:13.625
be unchanged.
That requires A equal to

00:50:13.625 --> 00:50:15.460
A star and B equal
to B star.

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.389
Thanks for pointing out that
here.

00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:23.281
We do want A equal to
A star and B equal

00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:27.598
to B star.
So, what I'm telling you is go

00:50:27.598 --> 00:50:31.937
take the solution,
conjugate it and equate it to

00:50:31.937 --> 00:50:34.398
itself,
and remember that now this

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:37.889
exponential remains real to
begin with so it doesn't go into

00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:39.555
anything.
It remains itself,

00:50:39.555 --> 00:50:42.845
and I compare this exponential
before and after its coefficient

00:50:42.845 --> 00:50:45.179
that went from A to
A star,

00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:47.051
they have to be equal so
A is A star and

00:50:47.051 --> 00:50:48.860
B is B star.
Yes?

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.205
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:50:51.205 --> 00:50:53.360
Shankar: Well,
look at these functions.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.770
There are no complex numbers
here.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.320
That's why everything is real.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.780
So, what problems have I solved
now?

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.880
First, I put γ = 0.
No friction.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.663
And I just re-derived the
harmonic oscillator because when

00:51:13.663 --> 00:51:17.514
I got the cos (ω_0
t - φ)--Then I took a

00:51:17.514 --> 00:51:20.913
problem with friction.
Then, I got a solution that was

00:51:20.913 --> 00:51:23.828
just exponentially falling
because even though it looks

00:51:23.828 --> 00:51:25.920
like α plus,
that's a negative number,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.789
that's a negative number,
in the end both are falling.

00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:32.012
It says you pull the mass and
let it go, it'll relax to its

00:51:32.012 --> 00:51:34.269
initial position,
it'll stop.

00:51:34.269 --> 00:51:37.998
But all of you must know that
there's got to be something in

00:51:37.998 --> 00:51:39.654
between.
In the one case,

00:51:39.654 --> 00:51:43.560
I have a mass that oscillates
forever, the other case I have a

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.929
mass when I pull it and let it
go,

00:51:45.929 --> 00:51:50.880
it goes back to equilibrium and
reaches 0 at infinite time.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.988
But we all know that the real
situation you run into all the

00:51:53.988 --> 00:51:56.360
time when you pull something and
let it go;

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.475
it vibrates and it vibrates
less and less and less and less

00:51:59.475 --> 00:52:01.410
and then eventually comes to
rest.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:05.945
Where is that solution?
It's got to come out of this

00:52:05.945 --> 00:52:08.210
thing.
Yes?

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.202
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:52:09.202 --> 00:52:11.144
Shankar: That's correct.
So, you've got to go back to

00:52:11.144 --> 00:52:13.116
the roots I found.
For α,

00:52:13.116 --> 00:52:17.381
it's minus γ over 2,
plus or minus square root of

00:52:17.381 --> 00:52:21.266
γ over 2 square,
minus ω_0

00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:23.481
square.
I've taken γ over 2 to

00:52:23.481 --> 00:52:25.130
be bigger than
ω_0.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.067
So, what I did was I turned on
friction but I didn't turn on a

00:52:29.067 --> 00:52:32.265
small amount of friction.
I turned on a rather hefty

00:52:32.265 --> 00:52:35.567
amount of friction so that the
friction term was bigger than

00:52:35.567 --> 00:52:38.764
the ω_0 term.
But if you imagine the other

00:52:38.764 --> 00:52:41.724
limit where you have no friction
and you turn on a tiny amount of

00:52:41.724 --> 00:52:43.688
friction,
then the tiny γ over 2

00:52:43.688 --> 00:52:45.989
will be smaller than this
ω_0.

00:52:45.989 --> 00:52:48.337
Of course, then you've got the
square root of a negative

00:52:48.337 --> 00:52:52.059
number, right?
So, you should really write it.

00:52:52.059 --> 00:52:54.890
So, let's take γ over 2 less
than ω_0,

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.570
then you will write this as
minus γ over 2,

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:02.194
plus or minus i times
ω_0 square,

00:53:02.194 --> 00:53:06.067
minus γ over 2 square.
In other words,

00:53:06.067 --> 00:53:10.410
write this stuff inside as
minus of this number now,

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.667
and take the square root of
minus 1 and write it as

00:53:14.667 --> 00:53:15.860
i.

00:53:21.019 --> 00:53:23.320
So now, what do the solutions
look like?

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:28.808
They look like x equal
to Ae to the minus

00:53:28.808 --> 00:53:33.812
γ over 2.
Let me write the exponentials

00:53:33.812 --> 00:53:37.217
if you like.
Ae to the minus

00:53:37.217 --> 00:53:41.547
γ over 2,
t plus iω prime

00:53:41.547 --> 00:53:47.076
t, but I'm going to call
this combination as ω

00:53:47.076 --> 00:53:49.137
prime.
That's why we have

00:53:49.137 --> 00:53:51.639
ω_0 and
ω prime.

00:53:51.639 --> 00:53:56.559
Plus Be to the minus
γ over 2 minus

00:53:56.559 --> 00:53:59.370
iω prime t.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:07.855
Now e to the minus
γ over γt over 2

00:54:07.855 --> 00:54:10.539
is common to both the factors.
You can pull it out.

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:14.230
Imagine pulling this factor out
common to the whole expression.

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.016
Then, you just got A to
the iω prime,

00:54:17.016 --> 00:54:19.530
plus B to the minus
iω prime.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:22.553
That's a very familiar problem.
If you want that to be real,

00:54:22.553 --> 00:54:25.679
you want A to be equal
to the complex conjugate of

00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:27.380
B.
Then, you repeat everything I

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.300
did before, so I don't want to
do that one more time.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.146
You will get some number C,
times e to the minus

00:54:32.146 --> 00:54:36.905
γ over 2t,
times cos ω prime

00:54:36.905 --> 00:54:42.108
t, plus,
you can add a φ,

00:54:42.108 --> 00:54:45.250
if you like.
There.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.570
So, what does this look like?
What does this graph look like?

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.672
It looks like cos ωt
but it's got this thing in the

00:54:56.672 --> 00:54:58.600
front.
If γ vanishes,

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.330
then forget the exponential
completely.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:05.164
This is our oscillating mass.
If γ is not 0,

00:55:05.164 --> 00:55:09.323
imagine it's one part in
10,000, then for the first one

00:55:09.323 --> 00:55:13.019
second this number will hardly
change from 1.

00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:16.360
Meanwhile, this would have
oscillated some number of times.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.615
But if you wait long enough
this exponential will start

00:55:19.615 --> 00:55:22.750
coming into play and the way to
think about it is,

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:27.447
it's an oscillation whose
amplitude itself falls with

00:55:27.447 --> 00:55:29.847
time.
And if you draw a picture of

00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:33.573
that, I think you will not be
surprised that if you draw the

00:55:33.573 --> 00:55:36.410
picture it will look like this.
It's called a damped

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.860
oscillation.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:46.739
So, that's the method by which
you describe the three cases.

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:51.128
One is no friction and one is
small friction or friction

00:55:51.128 --> 00:55:54.959
obeying this condition,
when you have oscillatory

00:55:54.959 --> 00:55:58.710
motion whose amplitude is damped
with time.

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.686
Then you have the other case
where the gammas has crossed

00:56:01.686 --> 00:56:04.397
some threshold when
ω_0 is smaller

00:56:04.397 --> 00:56:07.434
than γ over 2,
then you get two falling

00:56:07.434 --> 00:56:10.521
exponentials.
So, what do you imagine the

00:56:10.521 --> 00:56:12.908
mass is doing?
There's no friction if you pull

00:56:12.908 --> 00:56:14.870
it and let it go;
it vibrates forever.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.036
That's not very realistic.
If you turn a tiny amount of

00:56:18.036 --> 00:56:20.680
friction, it will do this,
which is very ubiquitous.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.376
We see it all the time.
You pull a spring and you let

00:56:23.376 --> 00:56:26.000
it go.
After a while, it comes to rest.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.188
This tells you it never quite
comes to rest because as long as

00:56:29.188 --> 00:56:31.540
t is finite,
this number is going to be

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:35.039
non-0, but it'll be very small.
At some point you just cannot

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:37.550
see it.
Third option is overdamped.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:39.678
Overdamped is when γ is
bigger than

00:56:39.678 --> 00:56:42.516
ω_0 over 2,
then the answer has nothing

00:56:42.516 --> 00:56:44.878
that oscillates.
Nothing oscillates,

00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:47.860
everything falls exponentially
with time.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.139
That is, you should imagine you
pull something,

00:56:51.139 --> 00:56:53.920
let it go, it comes slowly and
stops.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.585
When you buy your shocks in
your car, the shock absorbers,

00:56:57.585 --> 00:57:00.929
they're supposed to damp the
vibration of the car.

00:57:00.929 --> 00:57:05.205
It's got a spring suspending
the tires, but it's immersed in

00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:08.321
some viscous medium.
So that is, vibrations are

00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:10.088
damped.
So, when you hit a bump,

00:57:10.088 --> 00:57:13.009
if your shocks are dead,
you vibrate a lot of times and

00:57:13.009 --> 00:57:15.811
slowly settle down.
That's when your shocks are in

00:57:15.811 --> 00:57:18.002
this regime.
When you bought them,

00:57:18.002 --> 00:57:21.064
they were in this regime.
When you bought them they were

00:57:21.064 --> 00:57:22.922
doing this.
Once you hit a bump and you

00:57:22.922 --> 00:57:25.972
overshoot from your position,
you come down to 0 and you stay

00:57:25.972 --> 00:57:28.799
there.
That's the ideal situation for

00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:29.510
damping.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:40.124
All right.
So, I'm going to the last topic

00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:45.362
in oscillation but is there
anything that you need

00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:48.000
clarification?
Yes?

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.021
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:57:50.021 --> 00:57:50.969
Shankar: Ah,
yes.

00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:55.126
So, when γ over 2
equals ω_0,

00:57:55.126 --> 00:57:58.915
this thing vanishes,
and you seem to have only one

00:57:58.915 --> 00:58:02.599
solution, e to the minus
γt over 2.

00:58:02.599 --> 00:58:05.639
You don't have the plus or
minus, right.

00:58:05.639 --> 00:58:07.972
And we sort of know in every
problem there must be two

00:58:07.972 --> 00:58:10.393
solutions, because we should be
able to pick the initial

00:58:10.393 --> 00:58:13.832
position and velocity at will.
If a solution has only one free

00:58:13.832 --> 00:58:16.840
parameter, you cannot pick two
numbers at will.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.023
Now, that's a piece of
mathematics I don't want to do

00:58:21.023 --> 00:58:26.011
now, but what you can show is in
that case, the second solution

00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:28.795
looks like this.
It's a new function,

00:58:28.795 --> 00:58:32.439
not an exponential but t
times an exponential will solve

00:58:32.439 --> 00:58:35.086
the equation.
Those who want to see that this

00:58:35.086 --> 00:58:37.840
is true can put that into the
equation and check.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.034
In other words,
pick your γ carefully

00:58:40.034 --> 00:58:41.780
so that the square root
vanishes.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.559
Only a γ is left,
but that γ is not

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:47.994
independent of ω.
That γ is equal to

00:58:47.994 --> 00:58:51.784
2ω_0.
For that problem you can check

00:58:51.784 --> 00:58:54.190
that that's a solution,
so is that.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:58.074
There are nice ways to motivate
that but I think I don't have

00:58:58.074 --> 00:58:59.989
time to do that.
Yes?

00:58:59.989 --> 00:59:02.368
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:59:02.368 --> 00:59:05.280
Shankar: Why was A
equal to A star here?

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.550
You mean here?
Okay, take this x.

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.799
Demand that when you conjugate
it nothing should happen,

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:15.091
okay.
In this particular example,

00:59:15.091 --> 00:59:18.530
when α plus an
α minus real numbers,

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.874
e to the α plus
t, remains e to

00:59:20.874 --> 00:59:23.019
the α plus t when
you take conjugate.

00:59:23.019 --> 00:59:25.584
So therefore,
A has to remain A

00:59:25.584 --> 00:59:28.964
star, and B must also
remain invariant when you take

00:59:28.964 --> 00:59:30.988
the conjugation.
In other words,

00:59:30.988 --> 00:59:34.020
if this was an imaginary
exponential like in the other

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.074
problem,
when you take the conjugate,

00:59:36.074 --> 00:59:39.179
this exponential becomes this
guy and that exponential becomes

00:59:39.179 --> 00:59:41.198
that guy.
Then, by matching the solution,

00:59:41.198 --> 00:59:43.969
you will be able to show this
must be the conjugate of that;

00:59:43.969 --> 00:59:45.949
that must be the conjugate of
this.

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:48.440
But if no imaginary
exponentials appear,

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.739
each term must separately be
real.

00:59:50.739 --> 00:59:54.409
Now, this is something you will
have to think about.

00:59:54.409 --> 00:59:57.037
I'm not saying my repeating it
makes it any clearer,

00:59:57.037 --> 00:59:59.510
so what I want you to do is
take the x,

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:02.659
take the complex conjugate of
x, equate the two sides.

01:00:02.659 --> 01:00:06.034
There's a rule among functions
that if you got e to the

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:08.724
plus αt,
its coefficient should match on

01:00:08.724 --> 01:00:11.893
both sides and e to the
minus αt should have

01:00:11.893 --> 01:00:14.494
matching coefficients.
It's like saying when two

01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:16.717
vectors are equal,
the coefficient of I

01:00:16.717 --> 01:00:19.730
should match and the coefficient
of J should match.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:22.125
There's a similar theorem that
if you take a sum of two

01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:24.821
independent functions,
equate it to the sum of [same]

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.920
two independent functions,
the coefficient must separately

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.184
match.
If you impose that you will

01:00:30.184 --> 01:00:34.024
find what I told you.
Okay, now for the really

01:00:34.024 --> 01:00:38.373
interesting problem.
The really interesting problem

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:40.286
is this.
I got the mass,

01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:43.255
I got the spring,
I got the friction,

01:00:43.255 --> 01:00:48.038
but I'm going to apply an extra
force, F_0 cos

01:00:48.038 --> 01:00:50.751
ωt.
This is called a "driven

01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:53.937
oscillator."
So far, the oscillator was not

01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:55.639
driven.
In other words,

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:58.110
no one is pushing and pulling
it.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.755
Of course, you pulled it in the
beginning and you released it,

01:01:00.755 --> 01:01:02.749
but once you released it,
no one's touching the

01:01:02.749 --> 01:01:04.979
oscillator.
The only forces on it are due

01:01:04.979 --> 01:01:07.539
to internal frictional forces or
spring force.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:12.556
But now, I want to imagine a
case where I am actively driving

01:01:12.556 --> 01:01:17.489
the oscillator by my hand,
exerting cos ωt force.

01:01:17.489 --> 01:01:24.489
So ω here is the
frequency of the driving force,

01:01:24.489 --> 01:01:26.750
okay.
That's why there are so many

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.700
ωs in this problem.
The ω prime that you

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.409
saw here is not going to appear
too many times.

01:01:32.409 --> 01:01:35.090
It's a matter of convenience to
call this ω prime.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.099
But this ω will appear
all the time.

01:01:37.099 --> 01:01:39.138
When I write an ω with
no subscript,

01:01:39.138 --> 01:01:41.130
it's the frequency of the
driving force,

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:46.402
and the equation we want to
solve is x double dot,

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:50.659
plus γ plus dot,
plus ω_0

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:54.070
square x equal to
F over m,

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.670
because I divided everything by
m, cos ωt.

01:02:00.409 --> 01:02:01.640
So, we've got to solve this
problem.

01:02:07.929 --> 01:02:10.984
Now, this is really difficult
because you cannot guess the

01:02:10.984 --> 01:02:12.860
answer to this by a word
problem.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.106
Now, you can do the following.
If the right-hand side had been

01:02:18.106 --> 01:02:21.559
e to the iωt
instead of cos ωt,

01:02:21.559 --> 01:02:24.580
you would be fine because then
you can pick an x that

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.679
looks like e to the
iωt,

01:02:26.679 --> 01:02:28.279
and when you take two
derivatives that look like

01:02:28.279 --> 01:02:30.383
e to the iωt,
one derivative would look like

01:02:30.383 --> 01:02:32.553
e to the iωt;
x itself would look like

01:02:32.553 --> 01:02:34.473
e to the iωt,
you can cancel it on both

01:02:34.473 --> 01:02:36.787
sides.
But what you have is cos

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:40.190
ωt.
So, here is what people do.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:44.337
It's a very clever trick.
People say, let me manufacture

01:02:44.337 --> 01:02:47.630
a second problem.
Nobody gave me this problem.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.329
Okay, this is a problem you
gave me.

01:02:49.329 --> 01:02:52.302
I make up a new problem,
the answer to which is called

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:52.920
u.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.460
But y is the answer to
the following problem.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:08.792
The driving force is sin
ωt, but this is what you

01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:15.889
give me to solve.
This is my artifact.

01:03:15.889 --> 01:03:18.522
I introduced a new problem you
did not give me,

01:03:18.522 --> 01:03:20.640
but I want to look at this
problem.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:27.427
Now, here is a trick.
You multiply this equation by

01:03:27.427 --> 01:03:30.580
any number;
it's still going to satisfy the

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.070
equation.
Let me multiply by i.

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.194
Put an i here,
put an i here,

01:03:35.194 --> 01:03:37.469
put an i here,
put an i here.

01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:41.230
Multiply both sides by i
and add them.

01:03:46.179 --> 01:03:49.509
Then I have got x plus
iy, double dot,

01:03:49.509 --> 01:03:51.860
plus γ times x
dot,

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.766
plus iy dot is
ω_0 square

01:03:53.766 --> 01:03:55.050
times x,
plus iy.

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:58.311
Let's introduce a number
z, which is x plus

01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:00.260
iy.
It varies with time.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.145
Then this equation,
by adding the two equations,

01:04:03.145 --> 01:04:07.044
look like z double dot,
plus γz dot,

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:12.654
plus ω_0
square z is F over

01:04:12.654 --> 01:04:15.750
me to the Iωt.

01:04:21.389 --> 01:04:25.907
So, I have manufactured a
problem in which the thing

01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:29.449
that's vibrating is not a real
number.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:33.219
The force driving it is also
not a real number.

01:04:33.219 --> 01:04:36.139
It's a cos ωt plus I
sin ωt.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:41.061
But if I can solve this problem
by some trick,

01:04:41.061 --> 01:04:44.780
at the end what do I have to
do?

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.576
I have to take the real part of
the answer, because the answer

01:04:48.576 --> 01:04:51.750
will look like a real part and
an imaginary part;

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.929
I'll have to dump the imaginary
part.

01:04:53.929 --> 01:04:56.579
That'll be the answer to the
question I posed.

01:04:56.579 --> 01:05:00.369
The imaginary part of it will
be the answer to the fictitious

01:05:00.369 --> 01:05:03.140
question I posed.
Now, why am I doing this?

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.360
The reason is the following.
If the driving force is

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.210
e to the iωt,
I can make the following

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.800
ansatz,
or a guess.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.519
z is some constant times
e to the iωt.

01:05:15.519 --> 01:05:19.233
I will show you now solutions
of this form do exist,

01:05:19.233 --> 01:05:23.019
because let me take that
assumed form and put it into

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:26.219
this equation.
Then, what do I get?

01:05:26.219 --> 01:05:30.684
I get minus ω square,
Z_0e to the

01:05:30.684 --> 01:05:34.836
iωt because two
derivatives of e to the

01:05:34.836 --> 01:05:38.909
iωt give me iω
times iω.

01:05:38.909 --> 01:05:42.861
Then, one derivative gives me
iω times γ,

01:05:42.861 --> 01:05:46.389
times z_0 e to
the iωt,

01:05:46.389 --> 01:05:49.472
and no derivatives,
just leaves it alone,

01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:54.018
e to the iωt
equals F_0 over

01:05:54.018 --> 01:05:56.700
m,
e to the iωt.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.440
So, let me rewrite this as
follows.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.827
Let me rewrite this as minus
ω square,

01:06:06.827 --> 01:06:11.117
plus iωγ,
plus ω_0

01:06:11.117 --> 01:06:14.820
square,
times z_0e to

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.502
the iωt,
is F over m,

01:06:18.502 --> 01:06:23.530
e to the iωt.
This is what I want to be true.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:26.097
Well, e to the
iωt, whatever it is,

01:06:26.097 --> 01:06:28.769
can be canceled on two sides
because it is not 0.

01:06:28.769 --> 01:06:31.321
Anything that's not 0 you can
always cancel,

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.110
and here is the interesting
result you learn.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:39.279
For this equation to be valid,
the z_0 that

01:06:39.279 --> 01:06:44.010
you pick here in your guess
satisfies the condition,

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:48.849
z_0 equals
F over m divided

01:06:48.849 --> 01:06:53.690
by ω_0 square
minus ω square,

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.450
plus iωγ.

01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:10.429
Now, parts of it may be easy,
parts of it may be difficult.

01:07:10.429 --> 01:07:13.904
The easy part is to take the
guess I made and stick it into

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:16.540
the equation,
cancel exponentials and get the

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.282
answer.
What you should understand is,

01:07:19.282 --> 01:07:21.849
x was what I was looking
for.

01:07:21.849 --> 01:07:24.043
I brought in a partner
y, and I solved for

01:07:24.043 --> 01:07:26.099
z, which is x plus
iy,

01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:31.067
and z was assumed to
take this form with the

01:07:31.067 --> 01:07:35.340
amplitude, which itself could be
complex,

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.059
times e to the
iωt.

01:07:37.059 --> 01:07:39.612
If z_0 looks
like this, then z,

01:07:39.612 --> 01:07:42.070
which is z_0e
to the iωt,

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:45.672
looks like F over
m, e to the

01:07:45.672 --> 01:07:49.789
iωt divided by this
number in the denominator,

01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:52.409
I'm going to call I for
impedance.

01:07:52.409 --> 01:07:57.343
I is called impedance
and there's the following

01:07:57.343 --> 01:08:01.438
complex number,
ω_0 square,

01:08:01.438 --> 01:08:05.720
minus ω square,
plus iωγ.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.420
Okay, we're almost done now.

01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:25.975
The z looks like
F_0 over

01:08:25.975 --> 01:08:30.508
m, e to the
Iωt divided by this

01:08:30.508 --> 01:08:34.278
complex number I.
Imagine this complex number

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:35.869
I.
What does it look like?

01:08:35.869 --> 01:08:38.899
It's a got a real part and an
imaginary part.

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:42.056
Imaginary part is iωγ,
real part is

01:08:42.056 --> 01:08:46.020
ω_0 square
minus ω square.

01:08:49.449 --> 01:08:54.100
This is the complex number
I.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.788
So, we are told the answer to
our problem is to find this

01:08:57.788 --> 01:09:00.619
number z,
then take the real part.

01:09:00.619 --> 01:09:05.054
Does everybody agree that every
complex number I can be written

01:09:05.054 --> 01:09:09.060
as an absolute value times
e to the iφ.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.569
φ, which is going to be
here.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:16.358
And I'm going to write it that
way because now things become a

01:09:16.358 --> 01:09:19.420
lot simpler if you write it that
way.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.538
F_0 over
m, divided by absolute

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:26.969
value of i,
e to the iφ,

01:09:26.969 --> 01:09:31.076
e to the iωt.
Now, this e to the

01:09:31.076 --> 01:09:35.076
iφ, I can delete it here
and put it upstairs as minus

01:09:35.076 --> 01:09:36.010
iφ.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.610
So, let me write it in that
form.

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:44.267
Then it's very easy.
F_0 over

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:47.930
m, divided by the
magnitude of this I,

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:53.434
times e to the
Iωt minus φ,

01:09:53.434 --> 01:09:58.592
where φ is this angle.
Well, now that I got

01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:00.850
z, I know how to find
x.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:04.270
x is the real part of
z.

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:07.537
Now, when I look at real part,
all of these are real numbers

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.686
so I will keep them as they are.
F_0 over

01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:13.422
m divided by i,
and the real part of this

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:16.260
function, I hope you know by
now, is cos ωt minus

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.020
φ.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:29.060
And that's the answer.
The answer to the problem that

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.970
was originally given to us is
the following.

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.840
You know the magnitude of the
applied force,

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.449
the amplitude of the applied
force.

01:10:35.449 --> 01:10:37.159
You know the mass of the
particle.

01:10:37.159 --> 01:10:40.539
You need to find the absolute
value of I and φ.

01:10:40.539 --> 01:10:44.271
For that, you construct this
complex number whose real part

01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:47.359
is this, whose imaginary part is
iωγ.

01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:51.456
Then, the absolute value of
I is just by Pythagoras'

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:55.623
theorem, ω_0
square minus ω square

01:10:55.623 --> 01:10:59.579
square,
plus ω square γ

01:10:59.579 --> 01:11:03.039
square.
And the phase φ obeys

01:11:03.039 --> 01:11:07.134
the condition tan
φ is equal to

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:12.140
ωγ divided by
ω_0 square,

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:18.234
minus ω square square
is ω square γ

01:11:18.234 --> 01:11:20.050
square.
I'm sorry.

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:22.190
It's just the imaginary part
over the real part.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:33.229
So, this is the answer to the
problem that was given to us.

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:37.149
But there's one subtle point
you should notice,

01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:40.920
which is the following.
Where are the three parameters

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.017
in this problem?
Everything is determined in

01:11:45.017 --> 01:11:47.887
this problem.
φ, absolute I,

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.835
all these are known,
but we know every equation

01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:52.530
should have two free numbers.
You know what they are?

01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:59.140
Anybody know?
Okay, let me tell you what the

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.514
answer to that question is.
I'm saying, I can add to this

01:12:04.514 --> 01:12:10.380
the solution I got earlier on
without the driving force,

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:14.761
because in this problem,
when I had a right-hand side

01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:18.770
with a driving force,
let me add a 0 to that.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:22.019
That's harmless,
and by superposition principle,

01:12:22.019 --> 01:12:25.060
if that force will produce that
displacement,

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.390
0 will produce what?
Well, we have seen all morning

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.286
that even when the right-hand
side is 0, they are the

01:12:31.286 --> 01:12:34.452
solutions I got for you.
e to the γ over

01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:37.776
2 cos ω prime t
etc., so you can always add to

01:12:37.776 --> 01:12:39.797
this,
what you call a complementary

01:12:39.797 --> 01:12:43.170
function, which is the solution
of the equation with no driving

01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:45.356
force,
which is what we were studying

01:12:45.356 --> 01:12:47.411
earlier in the class.
But usually,

01:12:47.411 --> 01:12:51.332
people don't bother with this
because they all have in them

01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:54.239
e to the minus γt
over 2.

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:57.560
So, if you wait long enough,
this will die out,

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.880
and this is the only thing that
will remain.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.060
So at earlier times,
this is not the full answer.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:08.945
You should add to this the
answer when there is no driving

01:13:08.945 --> 01:13:12.149
force and together they form the
full answer,

01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:15.340
and the numbers A and
B that you have there

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.189
will be chosen to match some
initial conditions,

01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:22.930
like initial position,
initial velocity.

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:26.201
Okay now, time is up.
I'm going to stop,

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:29.933
so I have not been able to
finish some parts of this,

01:13:29.933 --> 01:13:32.659
so I'm trying to see what I can
do.

01:13:32.659 --> 01:13:37.072
I had asked for you to give
this problem set to me on--what

01:13:37.072 --> 01:13:39.480
is this today?
On Wednesday, right.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.453
So, you don't have enough time.
I mean, I haven't taught you a

01:13:42.453 --> 01:13:44.900
few other things you need about
five minutes more of work.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:47.909
I don't want to keep you back.
So, here is what I will do.

01:13:47.909 --> 01:13:51.464
I will post on the website some
notes on just the missing part

01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:55.077
here, so you can read it and you
can do one or two problems you

01:13:55.077 --> 01:13:57.350
may not be able to do without
that.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:00.449
Then, I will come on Wednesday,
I will teach that to you again,

01:14:00.449 --> 01:14:03.000
but you will be able to hand in
your problem set.

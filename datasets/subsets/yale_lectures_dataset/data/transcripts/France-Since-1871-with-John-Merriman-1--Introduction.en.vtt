00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.083
Professor John Merriman:
This is History of France,

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:08.372
1871 to the Present.
And my name's Merriman,

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:12.095
and we meet Monday and
Wednesday in this room,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:16.023
which is a pretty good room.
And the third,

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:20.990
the famous third hour to be
arranged is a section.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.504
At the moment we have been
assigned four TAs,

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.190
though looking around we won't
need four TAs,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.993
but at the moment we have
Da-Ihn Yoo, we have Michael

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:35.610
Verriman, we have Andrey Ivanov,
and we have Brian Reilly.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.985
And knowledge of French or
anything at all about France is

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:44.380
not required in this class at
all.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.441
Some of you have had my
introductory class,

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.098
a lot of you haven't.
A couple of you have had the

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:51.720
first half of this course,
most of you haven't.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.062
Many of you won't be here the
next day, that's what happens

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:57.944
with shopping period,
and then the third day we see

00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:01.023
how many folks we have.
We do have, for those people

00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:03.743
who want to take it,
a travaux dirigés en

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:06.518
français,
we have a section that's French

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:08.871
speaking.
It's an idea that Chris Miller

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.159
in the French Department and I
came up with in the late '90s,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.930
and my old dear friend Dick
Broadhead provided the funding.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.384
And what this is,
is that if you want to take the

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:22.406
section in French,
you should have about an

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.643
equivalent of 130,
and the discussion's in French

00:01:25.643 --> 00:01:29.117
and a couple of the books--I'll
talk about them in a minute--you

00:01:29.117 --> 00:01:31.760
can read in French,
the others you read in English.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.651
And it's not a la-di-dah thing
where--I'll tell you,

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.882
once there was a student in
there who had really fantastic

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:40.410
French and I said,
"Why is your French so good?"

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.762
And this person looked at me
and said, "Well the maid was

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.056
from Dijon."
And another time,

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:46.631
somebody's French was very good
and I said, "Why is your French

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.555
so good?"
"Well mommy used to take us to

00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:53.840
Chamonix for the--pour les
vacances d'hiver."

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.431
Or, "our apartment next to the
Tour d'Eiffel gave me

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.970
contact with zee French
people."

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.055
And so it's not like that,
I assure you,

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.680
it truly isn't.
And you're not counted off for

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.240
errors that you make in writing,
either, if you're writing in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.759
French;
and it really rocks, trust me.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.129
We've done this for year after
year.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.596
One year we actually had
something like forty-two people

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:19.569
signed up, and the course was
much bigger,

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.304
and we thought they all thought
they were getting a free prize

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:24.629
or something for signing up,
there were so many of them.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.850
We ended up with about
thirty-two.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.057
We've had a few with eight.
As long as we have five it will

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:32.218
go;
but, it's really fun and you'll

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.251
know people around here,
if you're above a first-year

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.942
student who have taken this,
and it really rocks,

00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:41.385
it's really great.
And Brian Reilly is going to do

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:43.889
this.
He's from the French Department.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.835
So, I would encourage you,
if you have that kind of

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:51.327
interest, to do that.
And you won't regret it,

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:54.752
there's never been anybody who
regretted doing it,

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:59.236
and it's just a lot of fun.
The other sections will meet in

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:01.805
English.
And usually what we do in this

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:05.369
course is we offer some night
sections, because people are

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.765
kind of busy,
and so we--there'll be

00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:11.698
certainly a section Wednesday at
seven, certainly one Wednesday

00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:15.176
at eight,
there'll be certainly sections

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:19.794
Thursday at 1:30 and 2:30,
and the French section is

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:24.050
tentatively scheduled for-- what
did we say?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.240
We said Wednesday at 1:30,
isn't that it?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.942
Or something like that.
It all shakes down,

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.633
and it is fun.
Now what do you got to do in

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.718
the course?
Well you have to come with good

00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:35.330
humor, and that I hope you'll
have;

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.271
come to the lectures and do the
reading, see the films,

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:42.994
which I'll talk about in
awhile, and go to sections,

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:46.060
and hopefully participate in
sections;

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.590
and the sections tend to be fun
in this course.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.895
So, as so far I know,
you're dying to know about

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:56.129
midterm and final and those
wretched things.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.179
I wouldn't give a midterm,
because I think it's a waste of

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.229
time, except we have to have
some sort of--it gives you an

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.689
indication how you're doing in
the course.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.250
If you screw it up we don't
count it as much as if you do

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.707
well.
And the final is--we will give

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:13.840
you on the last day of class the
questions for the final.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.376
We give you six questions.
And we will ask you on the day

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:20.267
of the final to respond to three
of those--our choice,

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:23.540
it would be hardly sporting if
you got to pick the three.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.505
And we also give you an oral
exam option that if you want to,

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:33.720
say, not be here on Christmas
morning taking your last final,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.809
because they tend to go to the
twenty-third,

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.579
you can just blow off those
days and go off to Bermuda,

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.798
or go home, or do whatever you
do, and take the oral final,

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:45.071
which we used to cheat and have
it during Reading Period but

00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.846
they caught on to me and you
can't do that so--they

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:51.341
frequently catch onto me--but so
now we have it on the first two

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:55.114
days of the Final Exam Period,
and you sign up for--it is not

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:57.776
an interrogation,
it is a friendly exchange about

00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:00.041
the themes of the course.
Most people,

00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.946
particularly in this course,
do that, but it's not

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:05.139
necessarily an advantage to do
it.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.398
People--this is not the
course--if they're doing,

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:10.257
working hard in this course,
this isn't the one out of five

00:05:10.257 --> 00:05:12.622
they're blowing off,
then they tend to do that and

00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:15.710
instead of writing for three and
a half hours and getting writing

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.040
cramp--and inevitably our final
exam was in that horrible place,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.023
Osborne Hall,
where you're sort of tilting

00:05:21.023 --> 00:05:23.540
like this, like you're leaning
out of an airplane,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.049
and you sit up there for three
and a half damn hours writing

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:29.497
your brains out,
and you can have a sporty

00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:32.748
conversation of twenty-five
minutes with one of the teaching

00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:35.449
assistants,
and you're out of there.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.769
So, that's what a lot of people
do;

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:40.440
in fact, about two thirds of
the folks do that.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.430
I have some very funny stories
about those, but now is not the

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.931
time to do that,
especially because we're being

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:48.279
filmed.
But most people do very well.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.509
Let me tell you a little bit
about the reading.

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.304
The books are available at the
Yale Bookstore,

00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:57.339
Barnes &amp;
Noble--here you guys,

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:01.917
here's some of these--and the
textbook is a good textbook,

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:05.050
it's really good in cultural
history.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.638
A guy called Chip Sowerwine,
Charles Sowerwine,

00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:12.227
who's a buddy of mine
from--lives in Melbourne,

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:15.269
in Australia,
and it's a good book.

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.850
And the other books are,
in their own way,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.180
sort of classics that you'll
enjoy.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.545
Now, many of you,
if you've had French anything,

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:25.012
have read Germinal,
and if you haven't read

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:27.579
Germinal,
now is your chance to read it.

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:31.237
Zola was one of the first great
naturalist writers and he would

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.656
go up to the nord,
to the Anzin,

00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:37.025
to the mines of Anzin,
up here in the north of France,

00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:41.029
and he would go down in the
mines and see how people worked.

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.094
He would see how
fifteen-year-old girls worked in

00:06:44.094 --> 00:06:47.286
the mine--Catherine,
who grows up rather quickly in

00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:49.904
the mines.
And germinal means "the

00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:53.879
budding," it's a reference to a
calendar of the French

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.339
Revolution.
It also kind of implies hope,

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:01.826
and it's about what happens
when people try to mobilize

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:06.480
these braves gars,
these workers in the mines.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.947
And if you've never read it,
it's a great,

00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:12.260
great, novel.
A Life of Her Own is a

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.749
book that I became obsessed
with, oh, about five or six

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:20.372
years ago.
Emilie Carles was born in

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:26.778
abject poverty in the High Alps,
in the Hautes-Alpes near

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.884
Gap,
up really high in the mountains

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:33.900
here, and she became a
schoolteacher as a common sort

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.920
of means of social ascension for
a poor person from a village.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.694
She was born right near the
Italian border,

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:43.169
but just in abject poverty.
She married an anarchist from

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:44.719
the Department of the
Ardèche,

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:46.269
where we happened to live or
are,

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:48.938
at least were legally residents
and spend much of our time down

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:51.560
here;
and she moved from one school

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.559
to the next.
And when she was a very old

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:59.058
lady, she led a demonstration to
try to protect her little part

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:03.920
of France on the Italian border
from being exploited by tourism,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.060
more about that at the end,
and with her tractor she led

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.436
this demonstration.
It was a phenomenal thing,

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:12.062
and she ended up on this very
famous French television show

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:14.211
called Apostrophe,
with Bernard Pivot,

00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:16.994
who said that she was one of
the most interesting people that

00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:20.380
he'd ever had on his show.
And she died in 1977.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.203
And she published her memoirs;
it was called A Soup Made of

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:27.956
Wild Herbs.
And of course it was translated

00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:30.738
into English with that title,
and then they changed it

00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:33.100
to--what did they change it to
in English?

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.123
A Life of Her Own.
And it's about being a young

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:38.574
girl and a woman,
but it's an extraordinary

00:08:38.574 --> 00:08:40.692
thing.
I became so obsessed with it

00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:43.764
that we drove up there so I
could visit every school at

00:08:43.764 --> 00:08:46.514
which she had taught,
and we actually found somebody

00:08:46.514 --> 00:08:49.283
who--we knew he wouldn't like
her because he was sweeping out

00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:50.850
the church,
he worked for one of the

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.460
churches, and she was very
anti-clerical.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.100
So, we actually met somebody
who knew her;

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.279
and the school is now named
after her;

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:58.829
but, it's a wonderful,
wonderful read,

00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.296
it's just great.
My family got a little tired of

00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:02.998
this and said,
"do we have to--how many more

00:09:02.998 --> 00:09:05.570
of these places do we have to
see in which this woman taught?"

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.007
But anyway, we saw most of them.
And then Henri Barbusse,

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:12.846
who was a Communist,
became a Communist,

00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:17.214
who was a writer in World War
One and who served in World War

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:19.646
One,
and he wrote a great book which

00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:23.314
is called Under Fire that
my dear friend and colleague Jay

00:09:23.314 --> 00:09:26.179
Winter has just written a new
introduction for,

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:29.789
and that's about the horrors of
the trenches.

00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:34.326
It's just the sheer--it's
amazing, it's an amazing read

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:36.720
too.
And then, Marc Bloch;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.331
I once had the pleasure when I
was giving a talk at the

00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.330
University of Strasbourg and
sitting in Marc Bloch's office.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:48.360
Marc Bloch taught people like
me in the way to do history.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.842
People like me grew up on
reading Marc Bloch,

00:09:50.842 --> 00:09:53.549
though I assure you he was much
older than me,

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:56.787
and he created a way of doing
history called the

00:09:56.787 --> 00:10:00.570
Annales School.
And his first book actually was

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.557
called The Healing Kings,
because in Medieval French

00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:08.750
times and Medieval English times
when a king was crowned there

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.669
was this sense that if the king
could cure you by touching

00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:16.463
you--excuse me for touching you.
If you had scrophula,

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:19.116
which was sort of a
degenerative disease--it's hard

00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:21.768
to find people who have
scrophula anymore--the king

00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:23.889
could touch the person and cure
it,

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.269
and it became part of sort of
the popular culture of royalty.

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:30.480
And they tried this in 1825
with disastrous results;

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.620
but, this was his first great
book.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.540
And at the age of about
fifty-five the war came along,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.350
and he wrote a book called
Strange Defeat,

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.480
explaining why in 1940 France
fell so rapidly.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.917
And then he'd been--he was
Jewish, and he was fired from

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:49.081
his post in Strasbourg,
under Vichy,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.737
that is the collaboration
government of World War Two,

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:54.565
because he was Jewish.
And then he caught on at the

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:57.717
University of Montpellier,
and then they realized that he

00:10:57.717 --> 00:11:01.060
was a Jew, so he was gone.
Then he went back to a farm

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.848
that he owned in the Limousin,
in the Creuze,

00:11:03.848 --> 00:11:07.649
up here near a boring place I
used to work called Gerais.

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:11.905
And he sat around and thought,
"well, I'm going to do

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.675
something."
So, not at a horribly advanced

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:17.119
age, I would like to think,
he went to Lyon,

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:20.415
which was a capital of the
Resistance because they have all

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:22.860
these things called traboules in
Lyon,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.921
was one reason--they're
passageways where you'd keep the

00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.855
silk, raw silk dry.
But he got set up by somebody,

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.740
by a French person--more about
this in a minute,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.717
and he was supposed to meet
somebody on a bridge overlooking

00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:37.493
the Saône River--Lyon was
at the confluence of the

00:11:37.493 --> 00:11:40.544
Rhône and the Saône.
You'll learn a lot about France

00:11:40.544 --> 00:11:42.496
in here, but we don't ask you
questions like that,

00:11:42.496 --> 00:11:43.889
"what two rivers meet in
Lyons?"

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:50.863
But, he was set up and he was
hideously tortured here and he

00:11:50.863 --> 00:11:54.252
was killed.
So Marc Bloch taught us,

00:11:54.252 --> 00:11:57.265
in a way, how to do history.
But he also,

00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:00.240
writing this book,
taught us how to think about

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.149
the past, and more about that in
a minute,

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:08.235
and how to think about what
happened in France between 1940

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:11.133
and 1945.
I do a seminar on that next

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:14.679
semester.
And then what?

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.700
I forgot one,
I forgot to put one in;

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.436
no, no here it is.
Sarah Farmer,

00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:21.273
who sat in the same classroom
literally, before it was

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:23.190
remodeled,
had written a wonderful book

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.500
called Martyred Village
which first appeared,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.915
chez Gallimard,
in France, and it's about a

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.578
village that I know very well
because I used to live in

00:12:30.578 --> 00:12:33.979
Limoges,
in which on the tenth of June,

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:38.568
1944, the SS,
German troops came and simply

00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:42.035
slaughtered everybody.
They shot the men,

00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:45.349
and they put the women and the
children in the church,

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:49.296
and they killed them.
But what's interesting about

00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:54.190
that is why this particular
village became the symbol for

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.559
martyrdom in France.
Why?

00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:01.214
Because it was thought to be
virgin, they weren't resistors,

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:04.930
they weren't collaborators--it
was there, it was martyred.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:10.036
And so, she wrote this book;
but, what's more interesting

00:13:10.036 --> 00:13:13.705
than that is that the people who
did the massacre,

00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:17.299
in the SS,
many of them were Alsatian.

00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:20.974
Now, Alsatians were French,
even though many of them spoke

00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:23.720
German dialect.
And so after the war they said

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.700
we are the
malgré-nous,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.340
we were put on trial
because--we were in the Army

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.564
because we were forced to be,
because Alsace was the

00:13:31.564 --> 00:13:33.779
next--directly into Hitler's
Reich.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:37.509
And when they were acquitted,
only two people who were

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:42.009
condemned from those forces,
they had joined voluntarily and

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:45.710
the others, the
malgré-nous were,

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.960
"in spite of ourselves," were
pardoned.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.980
There were riots Limoges that
they were pardoned.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.689
There were riots in Colmar and
in Strasbourg,

00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:59.820
in Alsace, that they had been
condemned at all.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.915
So identity,
national identity is very

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:06.513
complex, and we talk about the
war--this is,

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:10.952
it's a sparkling account.
And what they did with this

00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:13.338
village, ghoulish,
you might say,

00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:18.034
is they left it just the way it
is, or was, on the tenth of June

00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:20.322
1944.
They left all the buildings

00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:23.407
blown up or caught on fire,
and they have crosses where

00:14:23.407 --> 00:14:25.280
people were shot,
and there was,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.201
there used to be a ghoulish
museum with a knife opened up

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.809
that indicated they tried to
defend themselves.

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:33.567
And then now they've put in a
centre de mémoire,

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:36.143
sort of a memory site there,
that's kind of slick but it's

00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:37.699
fine.
A friend of mine who's a

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.519
senator is the president of it
there.

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:42.226
But they kept that village just
the way it was,

00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:45.802
and they built one next to it.
In about 1952 some people,

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.886
about your age,
started to party,

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:51.662
and somebody came out with a
gun and said we don't party in

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:54.749
Oradour-sur-Glane.
So, imagine growing up in a

00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:58.341
place like that where the past
was so--was written not only in

00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:00.519
the death of people that you
knew,

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:02.490
because everybody you knew died
basically.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.473
One woman got out,
she went through the--there was

00:15:05.473 --> 00:15:08.031
a vitrau,
a window behind the altar,

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.444
and she was able to get out.
Anyway, so those--the reading

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:13.070
is great.
So, what can I say?

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.050
I'm certainly biased but the
reading is great,

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:22.336
the reading rocks.
Now, what about the films,

00:15:22.336 --> 00:15:26.682
the movies?
Inevitably there is Paths of

00:15:26.682 --> 00:15:30.019
Glory, Les Sentiers de la
Gloire.

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:33.126
If you've never seen it,
it's a Kirk Douglas movie

00:15:33.126 --> 00:15:36.297
that's a good movie,
and it's about the mutinies on

00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:38.960
the Western Front,
and it's very good.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.395
We used to say,
well come to 101 and it'll be a

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:45.740
film that'll be shown at 8 p.m.
or something;

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.835
but, nobody ever does that,
they all watch it in the

00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:50.341
privacy of their rooms or you
can go watch it--we'll figure it

00:15:50.341 --> 00:15:52.477
out;
but, it's a really wonderful

00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:55.089
movie.
And then you'll see a film

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:58.079
called Au Revoir,
Les Enfants,

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:01.899
sort of see you children,
goodbye children.

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:04.200
How many have seen Louis
Malle's Au Revoir,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.431
Les Enfants?
Ah, many of you have seen it,

00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:08.405
it's a great film.
It's a true story,

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.690
it's about Fountainebleu,
which is southeast of Paris,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.589
sort of a fancy place,
and it's about his childhood

00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:16.419
when he was in
collège;

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:18.086
collège is a
middle school--you'll learn

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:20.099
about French schools.
My kids have been in French

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:22.629
schools for many years so I know
about these places.

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:27.859
And he--one day this boy showed
up in the class--this was during

00:16:27.859 --> 00:16:30.608
Vichy, about 1943,
maybe it's '44,

00:16:30.608 --> 00:16:34.526
and he's new and he's not
different, he's just not from

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.843
there.
He's obviously from Paris,

00:16:37.843 --> 00:16:42.392
and he was Jewish.
And it's about the attempt--the

00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:47.679
role of the Catholic Church in
Vichy is not a very savory one,

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:50.686
the French hierarchy and many
priests, but many priests were

00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:53.029
very heroic and when this
particular priest,

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:56.511
who was a real live guy called
Père Jean,

00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:59.154
Father John,
tried to hide this boy in the

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:02.506
school so he wouldn't be
arrested and sent off to the

00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:04.321
camps,
but he was denounced by

00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:07.127
somebody who was in the militia,
the milice is what it's

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:09.140
called,
which is sort of paramilitary

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.678
thugs that worked for Vichy;
and, of course,

00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:13.829
it does not have a happy
ending.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:17.815
And then the last film,
most of you won't have seen it,

00:17:17.815 --> 00:17:21.448
called La Haine;
hate, I guess you would

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:24.170
translate that as hate,
or hatred.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.085
And I'm very interested in what
happened in the French suburbs

00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:29.477
two years ago;
in fact, I wrote an instant

00:17:29.477 --> 00:17:32.610
article on it for an
encyclopedia because some of the

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.347
work I'd earlier done was about
why French suburbs and European

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:39.299
suburbs are different than
American suburbs.

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.280
American suburbs,
many of you come from

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.000
them--Hillsborough,
California;

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.700
Darien, Connecticut;
Grosse Pointe, Michigan;

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.277
places like that.
That's not what the suburbs are

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.447
in Europe.
Suburbs are where people

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.909
unwanted by the center go,
and the fear of the suburbs has

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:59.249
been something that--by the
prosperous center has been a

00:17:59.249 --> 00:18:01.410
very long,
important theme in French

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.410
history, particularly written in
Paris;

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.072
and I'll talk more about that.
And La Haine,

00:18:06.072 --> 00:18:09.589
which was a small budget movie,
became this great success;

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:12.651
and it's a tough movie to
watch, it's tough,

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:16.710
it's verbally tough to watch,
and it'll have subtitles.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:23.970
But it was done in 1996 or '97,
but it's really superb.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.887
So, what kind of--I don't want
to give everything away--but

00:18:27.887 --> 00:18:31.398
what kind of themes do we have
in a course like this,

00:18:31.398 --> 00:18:34.839
what have I forgotten about?
Oh me.

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.442
I'm Merriman,
I said that,

00:18:36.442 --> 00:18:39.518
I still am actually,
and sometimes I feel after a

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.722
day like yesterday that I'm sort
of, you know what,

00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:44.626
I'm not;
but, anyway,

00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:49.157
my office hours are--when are
my office hours?--Monday,

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:52.078
one to three,
in Branford College,

00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:56.339
where I was a Master long ago,
K13, Branford College.

00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:59.230
And I'm also like everybody
else on emails;

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.759
and I'll get your emails,
panic emails at 3:10 in the

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:07.220
morning and I'll reply at 4:45.
So, it goes like that.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.809
What kind of themes?
Let me talk a little bit about

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:12.913
some of them.
Let me just talk about,

00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:16.160
oh, about three or four of
them, just so you can see what

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.769
hopefully you'll be getting
yourself into.

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:20.385
And you'll have fun,
you'll learn a lot about

00:19:20.385 --> 00:19:23.256
France, I'll tell you that.
Okay, one theme I'm interested

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:25.786
in is--well let me tell you
about lectures,

00:19:25.786 --> 00:19:28.932
first of all.
I do not do chronological

00:19:28.932 --> 00:19:33.384
lectures, "well in 1882,
and then it was followed by

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:35.190
1883."
I don't do that.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.128
I lecture about what I like to
talk about, what's interesting,

00:19:39.128 --> 00:19:42.744
that'll hopefully make you
understand what the big issues

00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:45.536
are in all of this.
So, that's why it's a good

00:19:45.536 --> 00:19:48.200
thing to come to lecture and
also to read the books.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.509
But, one of the things I'm
interested in is national

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:55.273
identity, in fact because we
kind of have complex attitudes

00:19:55.273 --> 00:19:57.740
toward our own identity I
suppose,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.921
me and my family.
But, if you took--and a few of

00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:05.023
you have heard me say this
before so forgive me--in 1789 if

00:20:05.023 --> 00:20:08.630
you tried to guess how many
people spoke French,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.932
in France, you might come up
with eighty percent as a guess

00:20:12.932 --> 00:20:16.790
or ninety or whatever--it was
about fifty percent.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.410
Some people were bilingual.
So, what did they speak?

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.161
Well, start anywhere you want.
Breton, which is a language

00:20:24.161 --> 00:20:26.849
that has nothing to do with
French at all--here,

00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:29.205
oh I've got a really funny
story I was going to tell about

00:20:29.205 --> 00:20:31.102
a Breton priest,
a French speaking Breton

00:20:31.102 --> 00:20:32.830
priest, but that's for another
day.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.261
Anyway, they spoke Breton here.
Now, Nantes isn't considered

00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:40.257
technically part of Brittany,
but they spoke Breton there,

00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:42.359
which is basically a Gaelic
language.

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:45.312
And then if you go up,
you think, well they spoke

00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:47.466
French there,
certainly in Normandy,

00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:50.049
but they spoke in many parts a
patois.

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:52.637
In about 1844,
this kind of crazy guy took a

00:20:52.637 --> 00:20:56.067
big knife and he slit the throat
of his mother and his two

00:20:56.067 --> 00:20:58.941
sisters,
and they were--the police were

00:20:58.941 --> 00:21:01.902
looking for him.
And he was from Normandy,

00:21:01.902 --> 00:21:05.456
he lived near Cannes in
Normandy, and they found him

00:21:05.456 --> 00:21:09.150
eating clams and things for
survival on the beach.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.632
And they had to bring in a
translator, somebody to

00:21:11.632 --> 00:21:14.754
translate.
Before he was guillotined he

00:21:14.754 --> 00:21:18.456
dictated his life.
The book, Michel Foucault,

00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:21.988
a famous philosopher,
got a hold of and wrote a

00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:23.913
preface for it;
in French is,

00:21:23.913 --> 00:21:25.335
was, Moi,
Pierre Rivière,

00:21:25.335 --> 00:21:27.551
ayant égorgé
ma mère and mes deux

00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:29.717
soeurs.
And me, Pierre Rivière,

00:21:29.717 --> 00:21:32.413
having slit the throat of my
mother and my two sisters,

00:21:32.413 --> 00:21:34.210
I'm going to tell it like it
was.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.921
And he did.
But the important thing is that

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.859
they had to have a translator
for him in the 1840s.

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:44.064
When Bernadette of Lourdes,
in 1856, believed that she saw

00:21:44.064 --> 00:21:47.162
the Virgin Mary,
of course they had to have

00:21:47.162 --> 00:21:51.514
somebody come and translate
there what was a mountain patois

00:21:51.514 --> 00:21:55.776
influenced by Spanish.
But, if we'll move north here,

00:21:55.776 --> 00:21:58.778
up here a lot of the people
spoke Flemish,

00:21:58.778 --> 00:22:01.207
very few now.
You don't have to know this,

00:22:01.207 --> 00:22:03.108
it's just kind of fun;
I love it, but,

00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:06.352
anyway, and then in parts of
Lorraine they spoke a German

00:22:06.352 --> 00:22:09.769
dialect that's very much like
what's spoken in Fribourg.

00:22:09.769 --> 00:22:13.356
In Alsace almost everybody,
as you will see later,

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:15.891
spoke German dialect.
But it didn't mean,

00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:17.730
if you asked somebody,
"Are you French?"

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.416
and they reply in German,
"Yes, I'm French," that

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:23.550
doesn't--language doesn't
necessarily tell you how people

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.952
feel about their identity.
Some sage once said,

00:22:26.952 --> 00:22:31.345
I don't know who it was,
but I love this expression,

00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:35.910
that a language is a dialect
with a powerful army.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.631
Look at Spain.
Why was Catalan illegal to

00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:43.997
publish until Franco croaked in
1975, clutching the left elbow

00:22:43.997 --> 00:22:46.359
of St.
Therèse or something

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:48.869
another?
Because Castille,

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:53.607
Spanish speaking Castille,
with its command economy,

00:22:53.607 --> 00:22:58.809
had conquered the Basques and
conquered the Catalans.

00:22:58.809 --> 00:23:05.769
And so, all this will change
during this period.

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:09.600
Or, if you move further down,
you get into Savoie,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.180
which was Savoy,
Hautes-Savoie,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.961
Savoie, which were next in 1860
and they spoke in essentially

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:18.859
Piedmontese, they spoke an
Italian language.

00:23:18.859 --> 00:23:22.947
If you go to Provence then,
Provençal is a written

00:23:22.947 --> 00:23:25.112
language.
You get a sense of that if you

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:27.609
see a really great movie like
Jean de Florette,

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:30.547
with the inevitable
Gérard Depardieu who's in

00:23:30.547 --> 00:23:33.370
every single film made this side
of Disneyland,

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.157
Disneyworld, he is there;
but, with Daniel Auteuil,

00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:39.441
who was fantastic,
he had to put one of those

00:23:39.441 --> 00:23:42.763
things that dentists put in your
mouth when they're going to give

00:23:42.763 --> 00:23:45.669
you an x-ray that make you feel
uncomfortable in order to

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:48.680
pronounce perfectly this
Provençal language.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.740
And it's not just the accent of
"ain,"

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.148
"quatre-vain" or
"enfain" instead of

00:23:55.148 --> 00:23:58.000
enfin-- it's a whole
language.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.508
And, moving along here,
you get down to Catalonia,

00:24:00.508 --> 00:24:03.067
to French Catalonia,
speaks the same--we still know

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:05.319
old ladies down there who speak
Catalan,

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.724
the same language spoken down
all the way to Valencia,

00:24:07.724 --> 00:24:09.819
at least along the coast.
You move in here,

00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:12.273
you go to Basque
country--besides all the patois,

00:24:12.273 --> 00:24:15.804
you go to the Basque country,
Basque is only remotely related

00:24:15.804 --> 00:24:18.250
to Finnish and to Magyar,
to Hungarian.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.005
And then you've got all these,
you've got over in the patois

00:24:22.005 --> 00:24:25.349
here, you've got Limosin patois.
You've got all these languages.

00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:29.124
So, the only point of interest
about this is that when do

00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:32.089
people start thinking that
they're French,

00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:36.554
as opposed to from a certain
family, from a certain village,

00:24:36.554 --> 00:24:39.823
from a certain region?
When do they start thinking of

00:24:39.823 --> 00:24:42.610
themselves as French?
And this has been hotly debated

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.829
in the literature for a very
long time.

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:48.225
There are still people now that
live--there's a woman that lives

00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:50.920
near our village and she's lived
in our village,

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.767
she was born in the next
village, and she's lived in our

00:24:53.767 --> 00:24:56.718
village for forty years because
she married a guy from the

00:24:56.718 --> 00:24:58.598
village;
and she's from the next

00:24:58.598 --> 00:25:01.828
village, about twenty football
throws away, or a little more

00:25:01.828 --> 00:25:04.032
than that.
And somebody as a joke once

00:25:04.032 --> 00:25:07.295
asked her, "how do you feel
living in this village after all

00:25:07.295 --> 00:25:08.915
these years?"
And she said,

00:25:08.915 --> 00:25:12.074
"oh sometimes I get homesick."
There was a sense that she'll

00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:14.690
never be from the village,
she's from somewhere else;

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:20.855
but, sometime between 1750 and
maybe 1990 most--almost

00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:27.369
everybody in France began seeing
themselves as French.

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:31.642
And the schools play a major
role in this and thus all these

00:25:31.642 --> 00:25:36.276
kids who grew up speaking patois
or Provençal or Gascon--I

00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:38.791
forgot Gascon,
around Bordeaux,

00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:43.182
they can sing the Marseillaise
in acceptable French as they

00:25:43.182 --> 00:25:47.914
march off to be slaughtered.
When do peasants become

00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:52.483
Frenchman, as someone posed.
And it's an interesting

00:25:52.483 --> 00:25:56.764
question, because it tells you a
lot about regional identity and

00:25:56.764 --> 00:26:00.483
about national identity.
And the role of the schools is

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:04.313
important in that because what
happens is that the Virgin Mary

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.950
gets elbowed off the walls by
Marianne,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.009
the female image of the
republic, and that,

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:12.850
it starts with the French
Revolution,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.978
but it's a very long process.
So, we'll talk some about that,

00:26:16.978 --> 00:26:21.256
but not that much.
I guess the other two themes I

00:26:21.256 --> 00:26:25.278
want to discuss,
and not in great detail,

00:26:25.278 --> 00:26:29.690
but--are the wars.
Obviously, World War One

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.579
is--unleashes the demons of the
twentieth century;

00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:37.480
nobody could have anticipated
that all these empires would

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.624
collapse.
Anti-Semitism was out there

00:26:39.624 --> 00:26:42.970
before that, in Germany and
France, as you'll see with the

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.259
Dreyfus Affair,
all sorts of places;

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:50.502
but, World War One transformed
Hitler from a man who hated

00:26:50.502 --> 00:26:53.997
social democrats,
who hated socialists,

00:26:53.997 --> 00:26:57.859
into a man obsessed with
killing Jews.

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:03.235
World War One has an enormous
impact on the way people viewed

00:27:03.235 --> 00:27:06.730
themselves, in France and
everywhere;

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.460
everybody knew people who died
in the war.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.014
It was the defining experience
of the twentieth century,

00:27:14.014 --> 00:27:17.568
and the violence of the war
continues into the 1920s and

00:27:17.568 --> 00:27:19.623
'30s.
So, you can see the whole

00:27:19.623 --> 00:27:23.277
period till 1945 is an even more
horrible thirty years war than

00:27:23.277 --> 00:27:27.513
that of the seventeenth century.
There are 35,000,36,000

00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:32.240
communes in France,
that is administrative units.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.037
Paris is a commune,
but so is a village of twelve

00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:39.923
people, is a commune--36,000.
In World War One,

00:27:39.923 --> 00:27:43.380
only twelve didn't have
somebody killed.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.758
France in the 1920s was a
country of widows dressed in

00:27:47.758 --> 00:27:52.880
black, of people missing limbs
or coughing their lungs out from

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.087
the poison gas,
if they were lucky enough to

00:27:56.087 --> 00:27:59.654
survive, putting huge strains on
welfare systems--obviously it

00:27:59.654 --> 00:28:02.519
was very important that they be
taken care of,

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:05.958
in a country in which the
birthrate had stopped in most of

00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:08.854
the country in the
mid-nineteenth century--unique

00:28:08.854 --> 00:28:13.378
in the world.
There weren't enough men to go

00:28:13.378 --> 00:28:17.872
round, they were dead.
You can go into villages and

00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:20.914
towns almost anywhere,
particularly in the lower

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:25.020
Massif Central,
down here, and you can find in

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.529
towns of just tiny,
tiny towns, seventy-four.

00:28:29.529 --> 00:28:31.743
I'm a counter,
I count things all the time,

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:34.844
it drives me crazy.
I'll count up the number of

00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:39.350
people killed in every church
that I go to visit to look at.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.486
It's simply extraordinary.
We can't even imagine what

00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:45.529
that's like.
There are only three people

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:47.345
left in Britain who fought in
World War One,

00:28:47.345 --> 00:28:49.877
only three, and they're about
110-years-old or something like

00:28:49.877 --> 00:28:51.822
that.
But it's difficult to

00:28:51.822 --> 00:28:55.809
understand what the impact was,
and the poisoning of the

00:28:55.809 --> 00:29:00.400
political atmosphere.
We'll talk about the Battle of

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.149
the Somme, s-o-m-m-e.
And the Battle of the Somme,

00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:09.232
in the first day of the Battle
of the Somme,

00:29:09.232 --> 00:29:13.885
the first of July,
1916, there were 20,000 British

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:17.261
soldiers killed.
In the first three days,

00:29:17.261 --> 00:29:20.081
just counting the British,
there were more British

00:29:20.081 --> 00:29:23.075
soldiers killed and seriously
wounded than there were

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:25.319
Americans killed in World War
One,

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:31.819
Korea and Vietnam combined,
in three days;

00:29:31.819 --> 00:29:37.332
comparable chilling effects in
Russia, and in Britain,

00:29:37.332 --> 00:29:43.073
and in Austro-Hungary as well.
Where was the flower of English

00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:46.903
youth, this used to say?
Well, they were hung up on that

00:29:46.903 --> 00:29:48.786
old barbed wire,
they were dead,

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.519
and your life expectancy wasn't
very good,

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:55.501
because of foolish military
decisions, because of a war that

00:29:55.501 --> 00:29:58.740
ended up being the war fought in
which no one,

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.230
outside of a few people who had
seen the Russo-Japanese War

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.309
around Muckton,
could have ever imagined.

00:30:03.309 --> 00:30:08.369
The finest, some of the finest
books on any topic are those--of

00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:11.470
history--are those on World War
One,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.935
the great war in modern memory
of the British--of Siegfried

00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:18.630
Sassoon, about Siegfried
Sassoon,

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.200
and Wilfred Owen whose mother
got the news that he'd been

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.559
killed on the day of the
armistice.

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:27.547
There's an extraordinary
literature, the close

00:30:27.547 --> 00:30:31.000
concurrent,
the close competition for that,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.593
the richest literature would be
the Spanish Civil War with

00:30:34.593 --> 00:30:36.799
Orwell, and Borkenau and
Brennan.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.046
But, we'll talk a lot about
World War One,

00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:40.635
how it started,
what it meant,

00:30:40.635 --> 00:30:44.572
and what the impact was.
And there's nowhere you can go

00:30:44.572 --> 00:30:49.297
in Northern France where you're
not just awash with military

00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:53.418
cemeteries around Reims there,
anywhere up in the end near the

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:56.528
Chemin des Dames.
These are battlefields in which

00:30:56.528 --> 00:30:59.312
every day--in fact,
in the Battle of the Somme

00:30:59.312 --> 00:31:03.273
there was one casualty for every
meter of the entire front of the

00:31:03.273 --> 00:31:05.479
war,
of that particular battle--it's

00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:08.552
really extraordinary.
And it goes--it went on and on

00:31:08.552 --> 00:31:11.031
and on.
And we'll talk about the impact

00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:14.146
of what this happened,
there were obvious impacts,

00:31:14.146 --> 00:31:17.579
but what happened on civil
society and on politics.

00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.529
Where were the leaders of the
'20s and the '30s?

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:21.955
They were dead,
they were dead,

00:31:21.955 --> 00:31:25.269
killed at eighteen,
killed at nineteen.

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:27.630
I was in The British War
Museum, the Imperial War Museum

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.560
the other day,
and I'd been there four or five

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.022
times,
and I went--and they have a

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:32.589
thing where you can look up dead
people.

00:31:32.589 --> 00:31:34.484
And so I said,
well, I wonder if there's

00:31:34.484 --> 00:31:36.380
somebody with my name who was
killed.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.499
And there was.
And my uncle had an extremely

00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:40.330
odd--my grandfather had an
extremely odd name,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.690
and there was somebody of his
name too that was killed.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.541
They all died.
And it was--not everybody,

00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:49.314
but in France 1,500,000 people
died, and that's a huge

00:31:49.314 --> 00:31:52.637
demographic chunk,
it's like a big shark took a

00:31:52.637 --> 00:31:56.097
big bite out of your basic
pyramid of your demographic

00:31:56.097 --> 00:31:58.162
tree.
And something like Hitler--

00:31:58.162 --> 00:32:01.134
this isn't a course on Hitler
but it's from the other

00:32:01.134 --> 00:32:03.819
course--but why this guy who had
no friends,

00:32:03.819 --> 00:32:05.463
who was just a pain,
just a pain,

00:32:05.463 --> 00:32:07.930
he was so peinible,
he was such a pain;

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.755
and he had one guy that he used
to bore with his stories about

00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:14.890
architecture and painting,
and Wagner whom he loved

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.278
dearly.
And you could never imagine

00:32:17.278 --> 00:32:20.991
that he would be somebody that
people would listen to on the

00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:24.074
radio, hour after hour,
because that's how long he

00:32:24.074 --> 00:32:26.651
talked;
or that when Stauffenberg tries

00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:30.295
to kill him in 1944 the Germans
would pour out of the--into the

00:32:30.295 --> 00:32:32.940
street to thank god for saving
the Fuhrer.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.650
Why did he become somebody
Seig Heil?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.198
He was one of the guys,
he was one of the gars,

00:32:39.198 --> 00:32:42.356
he was one of the guys.
He'd been wounded three times,

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:45.357
and he was a runner,
he carried messages to the

00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:47.405
trenches,
from the generals who were all

00:32:47.405 --> 00:32:49.220
drinking champagne in Reims,
to the front.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.029
And he was wounded three times,
and he was one of them.

00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:57.180
He had that stamp of having
been one of the guys.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.174
And the violence keeps going.
You have to explain why all of

00:33:00.174 --> 00:33:02.342
this has happened,
and you have to find people

00:33:02.342 --> 00:33:04.330
that made it happen,
and it was the Jews,

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.619
and it was the socialists,
and it was the communists,

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:09.250
and it was the homosexuals,
and we'll kill them all.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:13.209
And that's what he did.
And for the point of view of

00:33:13.209 --> 00:33:16.704
France, they emerged from the
war with the reality that they

00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:20.259
are in victory a weaker nation
than Germany is in defeat.

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:24.246
And so it's a big shadow over
the whole damn

00:33:24.246 --> 00:33:26.755
thing--incredible.
And Marc Bloch,

00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:28.636
when you read The Collapse
of France,

00:33:28.636 --> 00:33:30.559
it's very interesting,
interesting stuff.

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:36.029
World War Two,
I'll give you two stories.

00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:38.841
When I was working in a place
called Tulle,

00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.720
which is down here--t-u-l-l-e,
not Tours,

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.737
but Tulle-- I knew vaguely that
there had been a massacre there

00:33:46.737 --> 00:33:50.217
in June sixth,
1944, and a lot of people had

00:33:50.217 --> 00:33:52.380
been hung.
I didn't have any money.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.760
My kids would say,
"oh dad, not that I don't have

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.984
any money story again."
But I didn't have any money and

00:33:57.984 --> 00:34:01.890
so I would be eating ice-cream
and I got to know this guy with

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.875
my not very good French then,
and we talked and I said,

00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:10.364
"do you remember the day the
Germans came back and hung all

00:34:10.364 --> 00:34:12.820
those people?"
And he said, "yeah."

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.199
And I said, "well how did you
get away?"

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.938
And he said,
"well,"--Tulle is in a,

00:34:15.938 --> 00:34:18.074
there's a big valley,
it's a real long town,

00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:20.360
and these houses have balconies
like this.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.088
So he went up and he hid.
He was twelve,

00:34:22.088 --> 00:34:24.280
he would've been killed,
fourteen, they didn't care.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.308
And one day so I was eating my
ice-cream because the archives

00:34:28.308 --> 00:34:30.860
were closed, and this woman came
up,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.172
and she was probably about
fity, or something like that,

00:34:33.172 --> 00:34:35.573
and she ordered ice-cream,
and so this guy says,

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.730
"well, Madame whatever,
Madame Dupuis,

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.770
you remember that day don't
you,

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.041
when the Germans came back?"
And she said,

00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:44.248
"oh I sure do,
they hung my husband from that

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:46.934
pole."
And that pole was right next to

00:34:46.934 --> 00:34:50.900
this ice-cream stand in front of
the theater in Tulle.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.849
And that was 1970--more about
that in a second.

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:58.139
And I have a friend who's a
Parisian lawyer who works in

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:00.591
Africa a lot,
and when he was a little boy

00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:04.119
the Germans came to get his
father who was a Greek Jew,

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.469
and he was taken away and
killed, of course.

00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:10.936
And one shouldn't forget that
the people who rounded up the

00:35:10.936 --> 00:35:14.565
Jewish children in the Marais,
where lots of Jews lived,

00:35:14.565 --> 00:35:16.850
were French--the Germans
would've been happy to do

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.739
it--but were French police,
they were French police.

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:25.360
And his father was denounced by
a policeman, by a policeman.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.303
And after the war that
policeman directed traffic at

00:35:28.303 --> 00:35:31.687
the market every Saturday,
and the widow walked by and saw

00:35:31.687 --> 00:35:34.709
this man, knowing he had
denounced her husband who had

00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:38.877
been taken away and killed.
Now, in 1970 there was still

00:35:38.877 --> 00:35:41.949
this collective amnesia in
France.

00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:45.624
The myth, perpetuated by De
Gaulle, the big guy,

00:35:45.624 --> 00:35:50.080
was that in France everybody
had resisted except for a few

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.935
elites,
and then France had risen up to

00:35:52.935 --> 00:35:56.733
follow his great shadow and had
thrown off the oppressor and

00:35:56.733 --> 00:36:00.783
founded a republic.
In 1953 there was a documentary

00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:04.691
made about the deportation of
Jews, from Paris,

00:36:04.691 --> 00:36:08.090
and there was a film made about
this.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.875
They put together a
documentary, and in one of the

00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:15.119
scenes it's a camp place called
Drancie,

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.588
which is out near the airport,
halfway to the airport,

00:36:17.588 --> 00:36:20.704
to Roissy Airport.
And there was a French gendarme

00:36:20.704 --> 00:36:24.862
who was guarding the French
Jews, a French gendarme guarding

00:36:24.862 --> 00:36:28.104
the French Jews,
and they lifted him out of the

00:36:28.104 --> 00:36:30.517
movie;
they literally took him off the

00:36:30.517 --> 00:36:32.336
screen.
So if you see it,

00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:34.769
he ain't there.
Why?

00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:37.403
Because the image was nobody
collaborated or hardly anybody,

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:39.873
and everybody resisted.
Now, that amnesia which--and

00:36:39.873 --> 00:36:42.676
part of it was De Gaulle didn't
want to give the communists

00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:44.924
credit,
because they were the party of

00:36:44.924 --> 00:36:47.630
75,000 martyrs,
because they were organized and

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.449
they resisted;
other people did too.

00:36:49.449 --> 00:36:51.923
There was a Catholic
resistance, there was your basic

00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.522
Gaullist resistance.
I remember when De Gaulle died

00:36:54.522 --> 00:36:56.865
I was in Paris.
I was the only person frisked

00:36:56.865 --> 00:36:59.269
going into Notre Dame,
literally, that I saw.

00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:01.675
They threw me up against the
wall and checked me out,

00:37:01.675 --> 00:37:04.219
because I was a kid and I
wanted to go there and see,

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:07.679
just for the purpose of
history, of being there.

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:11.179
But, De Gaulle perpetuated this
myth about the resistance.

00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:13.639
And then there were cracks in
the myth.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:16.975
And the first crack was a movie
that's so long that it used to

00:37:16.975 --> 00:37:18.945
be the janitors,
the people who cleaned

00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:21.769
these--the very nice people who
cleaned these rooms used to call

00:37:21.769 --> 00:37:24.010
it a two six-pack movie because
it was so long.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.700
I'm not supposed to say that,
we're filmed.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.916
Cut that baby out of there.
But, it's about a four-hour

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:34.620
film, and it's called The
Sorrow and the Pity and it's

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.892
about Clermont-Ferrand,
which is in the Massif Central

00:37:37.892 --> 00:37:40.216
here.
And there's some amazing scenes

00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:43.630
in it where they shave the heads
of horizontal collaborators,

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:46.737
which is sort of a crude way of
talking about French women who

00:37:46.737 --> 00:37:48.622
slept with German
officers--horizontal

00:37:48.622 --> 00:37:51.706
collaboration.
And at the end of the movie,

00:37:51.706 --> 00:37:55.010
there was Maurice Chevalier.
Maurice Chevalier was a

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.452
crooner, he was a singer,
he was--if your parents knew

00:37:57.452 --> 00:37:59.505
about France,
he was the person that your

00:37:59.505 --> 00:38:02.330
grandparents even had heard
about, and he was somebody from

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.401
a poor part of Paris,
and he was from

00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:07.346
Ménilmontant,
and he had this straw hat and

00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:09.690
he sung tunes-- "very good my
boys,"

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.201
and all of this stuff.
And at the end of the movie he

00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:14.288
says, "You know,
there are zese very bad

00:38:14.288 --> 00:38:16.808
rumors about me,
and that I sang for zee

00:38:16.808 --> 00:38:19.186
German troops,
and I want to tell you I only

00:38:19.186 --> 00:38:23.855
sang for zee boys,"
that is, for the French

00:38:23.855 --> 00:38:28.519
interned soldiers in Germany
then.

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:31.579
It may have been true or maybe
not, but it made people start

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:35.490
looking at the past,
what really happened between

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.755
1940 and 1945,
or '44, end of '44,

00:38:38.755 --> 00:38:43.595
what really happened.
There was a trial of a very old

00:38:43.595 --> 00:38:47.809
man in 1998 called Maurice
Papon, tried in Bordeaux.

00:38:47.809 --> 00:38:50.429
And he did very well after the
war.

00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:53.304
He had signed during the war
all sorts of slips that sent

00:38:53.304 --> 00:38:55.151
Jews off to the station,
the Gare St.

00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:57.102
Jean in Bordeaux,
to the train station,

00:38:57.102 --> 00:39:00.005
to be shipped off to the east;
but, he did very well,

00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:02.739
he became a minor Gaullist
official, and he did very well,

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:04.610
and they finally caught up with
him.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.308
And he said,
"I'm a good bureaucrat,

00:39:06.308 --> 00:39:08.250
I did--they were pleased with
my work.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.978
I signed those fiches,
those formulas and if I hadn't

00:39:11.978 --> 00:39:15.960
been there to save the hundreds
then they all would've died."

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.110
And he was--but you can't put
somebody 90-years-old in the

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.971
slammaire.
And so, he was in kind of in

00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:25.917
this very minimum security and
he finally just croaked a while

00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:27.486
ago.
One point that he tried to--he

00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:29.236
escaped actually,
with the help of some friends,

00:39:29.236 --> 00:39:31.470
and they found him dining in an
elegant Swiss restaurant.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.845
It was too--it was trop beau.
But, anyway,

00:39:33.845 --> 00:39:36.607
so the other thing that
happened was a friend of mine,

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:39.230
I'm very proud to say,
called Robert Paxton,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.815
wrote a book called Vichy
France, and he had to use

00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:46.148
captured German documents
because the French documents

00:39:46.148 --> 00:39:48.770
weren't open,
they were not available,

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.000
because the big secret of
collaboration should not be

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.348
known.
And we're going through in

00:39:54.348 --> 00:39:58.614
France the same thing now with
the War of Algeria too--but more

00:39:58.614 --> 00:40:02.107
about that later.
So, give me two more minutes,

00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:04.590
I'm going to end,
and a few of you,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.460
faces, I've heard this before,
people that I know;

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.634
but, I guess one reason why I'm
in history--well,

00:40:11.634 --> 00:40:14.280
because I read a book a long
time ago.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.805
I didn't know what else to do,
and I read one book that really

00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:20.511
influenced me.
But, I also read a poem,

00:40:20.511 --> 00:40:24.224
and this is kind of a
signature-- not my signature,

00:40:24.224 --> 00:40:27.864
but the kind of course it is.
Because you're going to hear

00:40:27.864 --> 00:40:30.619
about de Gaulle and you're going
to hear about fancy people,

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:34.655
but you're also going to hear
about very ordinary people who

00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:38.827
were caught up in kind of the
torrent of the twentieth century

00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:43.645
and the late nineteenth century.
So, let me just read you this

00:40:43.645 --> 00:40:47.626
poem, it is short,
and it's a Brecht poem and it's

00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:52.350
called "A Worker Reads History."
And then you can go home,

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.510
or go shop, shop till you drop,
whatever.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.130
Who built the seven gates
of Thebes?

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.050
The books are filled with the
names of kings.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.340
Was it kings who hauled the
craggy blocks of stone?

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.930
And Babylon,
so many times destroyed.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:12.869
Who built the city up each time?
In which of Lima's houses, 

00:41:12.869 --> 00:41:17.030
The city glittering with gold,
live those who built it?

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.680
In the evening when the Chinese
wall was finished

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.340
Where did the masons go?
Imperial Rome

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.880
Is full of arcs of triumph.
Who reared them up?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.860
Over whom 
Did the Caesars triumph?

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:37.110
Byzantium lives in song.
Were all her dwellings palaces?

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:42.020
And even in Atlantis,
of the legend

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:48.075
The night the seas rushed in, 
The drowning men still bellowed

00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:52.960
for their slaves.
Young Alexander conquered India.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.159
He alone?
Caesar beat the Gauls.

00:41:57.159 --> 00:41:59.150
Was there not even a cook in
his Army?

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.640
Philip of Spain wept as his
fleet was sunk and destroyed.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.989
Were there no other tears?
Frederick the Great triumphed

00:42:07.989 --> 00:42:11.880
in the Seven Years War.
Who triumphed with him?

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:17.067
Each page a victory,
at whose expense the victory

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:20.530
ball?
Every ten years a great man

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:25.360
Who paid the piper?
So many particulars,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.999
So many questions." 
And if you hang around,

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:33.434
as I hope you will,
we'll get to the bottom of some

00:42:33.434 --> 00:42:36.000
of them.
Have a good weekend!

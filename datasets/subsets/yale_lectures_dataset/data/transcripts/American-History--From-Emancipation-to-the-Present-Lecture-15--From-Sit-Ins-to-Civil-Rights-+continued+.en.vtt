00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.800
The song that, I imagine,
for many of you needs no

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.300
introduction, but for a
few of you who may not be

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.900
familiar with it, that's one
of the great anthems of the

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.167
civil rights movement, "We
Shall Overcome."&nbsp; You're

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:20.300
actually lucky, I'm a--in
past years I've had the TAs

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.100
get up and sing it with me,
I've had the class get up

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.067
and sing it.&nbsp;
For some reason,

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:29.200
I'm a--I'm, I'm absolving
all of us of that kind of

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.200
performance.&nbsp; I play it here
for reasons that will become

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.967
much more clear
later on in the lecture,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.600
but this is--this
piece of music,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.700
"We Shall Overcome," is one
of sort of the anthems of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.700
familiarity, of
memory, about the movement,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.700
and for very good reasons.&nbsp;
But as part of my larger

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.800
project of trying to help
us understand a different

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.100
notion of what the movement
was really all about,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.500
I want to throw the
song out to your senses,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
leave it dangling
there for a while,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.800
and come back and sort
of reinterpret it as this

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.100
lecture goes forward, as
much as I'm reinterpreting

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.700
the movement in many
ways itself.&nbsp; Let me,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
with that caveat out
there, that introduction,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.100
reading Fire Next Time,
James Baldwin's quite

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.867
important,
quite famous book,

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:28.700
I thought I would really
begin the lecture with a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.700
couple of quotes
from James Baldwin,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.367
from this really fantastic
documentary film on James

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:37.600
Baldwin called The Price of
the Ticket.&nbsp; I'd encourage

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
you all to see
it at some point.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's quite astonishing.&nbsp;
Baldwin says during this

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.700
documentary--he's, it's a,
it's archival footage.&nbsp; He's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.300
talking to, it
looks like to me,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.600
to be something like
an Oxford Round Table,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.767
or, or, or here like
the Yale Political Union,

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.500
something to that
effect, clearly college-age

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.867
students.&nbsp; And he
declares to these students,

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:06.300
that "It comes as quite a
shock to discover that the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.000
country to which you pledge
allegiance does not pledge

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.767
allegiance to you.&nbsp; It comes
as quite a shock to discover

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.067
that when you are a child
rooting for Gary Cooper to

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:20.967
shoot all the Indians,
that the Indians are you."

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:25.200
Gary Cooper, for
those who don't know,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.700
it's a different generation,
great cinematic hero,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
often played the good
guy, you know cowboys and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700
Indians.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700
And he realizes,
James Baldwin,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.567
as a little child, as he's
rooting for Gary Cooper to

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:41.467
kill all the Indians, he
actually is the Indian.

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.467
Later on in the
same documentary,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.867
Baldwin talking to
a studio audience,

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.800
being interviewed by one
of these talk shows.&nbsp; It's

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.767
poetic.&nbsp; He really
was poetic.&nbsp; He says,

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:57.900
"The day will come when you
will trust you more than you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.067
do now (speaking to
presumptively a white

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:05.567
audience) and you will trust
me more than you do now.&nbsp; We

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:08.300
will trust each
other.&nbsp; I do believe,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.400
I really do believe, in the
new Jerusalem.&nbsp; I really do

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900
believe that we can all
become better than we are.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.200
I know we can.&nbsp; But the
price is enormous and people

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.300
are not yet
willing to pay it."

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.100
Much of the 1960s is about
people coming to terms with

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.367
the fact of who they are
in the American pantheon,

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:33.167
the cowboys or the Indians,
and also coming to terms

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.700
with what the price of that
ticket is going to be.&nbsp; Now

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.700
I ended the last lecture
talking about the potential

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.800
failure of the
movement in Albany,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.167
Georgia, when the white
authorities outsmart the

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:54.567
activists by not reacting.&nbsp;
And then I mentioned,

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.800
along comes Bull Connor, who
as King would say later on,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.867
was the most important
person for the success of

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:06.700
the movement, because of the
severity of his actions.&nbsp;

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.967
Bull Connor's the
Commissioner of Public

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:09.800
Safety.&nbsp; I mean, I'll be
skirting along this very

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.500
quickly, since you
watched the documentary,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.800
4 Little Girls, and
you know a lot of this,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.267
this history and saw some
of the images as well.&nbsp; He's

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.000
the Commissioner of Public
Safety and he's running for

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.300
mayor.&nbsp; The
election becomes,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.667
I'll just say, fraught
with complication.&nbsp; There's

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:28.400
already
incredible tensions in,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.800
in Birmingham over
issues that were similar to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.900
Montgomery in terms of who
could shop in what stores,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.367
and in fact, on the
ground in Birmingham,

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:42.500
store owners were very
willing at this point,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.600
because of the threat of
economic warfare with the,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.500
with the black
buying population,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.800
very willing to
integrate the stores,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.700
but Bull Connor says no.&nbsp;
And Connor is essentially

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.167
running, running the city.&nbsp;
So things are brought to a

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:59.500
head.&nbsp;King, who's
not in Birmingham,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.300
is asked to come by the
Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.267
who is the head of a civil
rights--sort of organizing

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:07.267
civil rights
activism in Birmingham,

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:14.400
through a group called the
Alabama Christian Movement

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.500
for Human Rights, the
Alabama Christian Movement

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.767
for Human Rights.&nbsp; It is
essentially the NAACP.

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:25.367
I mentioned in the last
lecture that NAACP's books

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.500
would be opened up by,
by state governments,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.600
which would be essentially a
threat to lose jobs and to,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.067
and to be harassed, to
even be killed.&nbsp; Other

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.500
organization--organizations
spring up to replace the

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.700
NAACP.&nbsp; In this case,
it's the Alabama Christian

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.300
Movement for Human Rights.&nbsp;
Shuttlesworth calls King to

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.600
Birmingham, knowing that
King more than anybody else

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.867
has the ability to
electrify a population,

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.867
and frankly to antagonize
a population as well.&nbsp;

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.867
Birmingham had already been
the witness or home to all

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.300
kinds of violence.&nbsp;
Between '57 and '63,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.700
it had earned its nickname
of "Bombingham."&nbsp; There were

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.800
eighteen unsolved
bombings in the city in,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.867
in black neighborhoods,
excuse me.&nbsp; City parks had

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:17.600
been closed in
1962.&nbsp; Playgrounds,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.667
and pools, and golf courses
had gone private.&nbsp; All these

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:25.500
actions to prevent the
gathering of people,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.867
activists, black people, and
also to prevent an attempt

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:33.400
to force the integration
of public spaces.&nbsp; So

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.100
playgrounds, golf courses,
and pools go private.&nbsp; City

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.367
on edge.&nbsp;King comes to
Birmingham and willfully

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:48.100
gets arrested.&nbsp; He knows
he's going to get arrested.&nbsp;

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:55.000
He's trying to brew up
crisis.&nbsp; But unlike the

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.200
police in Albany,
Georgia, who just,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.367
you know, relaxed and let
things go and stayed in

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:03.700
touch with everybody,
Birmingham has not evolved

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.400
that way in the police
force.&nbsp; They throw King into

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.767
solitary.&nbsp; There's no word
coming from him.&nbsp; This is

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:14.800
actually terrifying.&nbsp; This
is an era when people would

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.767
disappear, and King being
such a high profile person

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:24.000
was not protected from
disappearing.&nbsp; Coretta Scott

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.100
King is frantic, wanting to
at least get reassurances

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.500
that her husband's alive,
not just safe but alive.&nbsp;

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.800
[coughs] Excuse me.&nbsp; John
F.&nbsp; Kennedy is currently the

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.867
President, been elected,
and he gets involved,

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:46.167
much like he did when he
was the candidate for the

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:50.200
presidency, and seeks
guarantees of King's safety

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.900
and that he's treated well.&nbsp;
While King is in jail,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.100
a number of
clergy in Birmingham,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.700
white clergy, moderates, are
basically upset that King is

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.700
coming in from out of
town, out of the blue,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.400
and is
antagonizing the situation,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.800
stirring up trouble,
and essentially is

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.267
telling--publish--they
publish a newspaper ad and

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.300
basically telling King
to slow things down,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.700
to calm down, to, to
lower the temperature.&nbsp;King

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.400
responds by writing one of
the great protest documents

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.800
and letters, and that's
the "Letter from Birmingham

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.967
Jail."&nbsp; Now the "Letter from
Birmingham Jail" is not in

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:36.167
your reader but, you
know, it's online.

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:38.667
I hope you've actually
already looked at it.&nbsp; It's

00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:41.300
not in your reader because
the King estate is rather

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:47.300
protective of King's legacy
and how much people are

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.600
going to pay to have his
words published.&nbsp; I'm being

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.000
extremely politic in saying
this.&nbsp; But the document is

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.267
one of the most important
documents in American

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:03.200
protest history.&nbsp; One of
the most frequently quoted

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.000
passages is one I shall now
quote as well.&nbsp; It brings

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.400
together King's
passion, of course,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.500
his eloquence, but also
humanizes this in a way that

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.200
connected with many
people.&nbsp; This was an,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.067
an immediate sensation.&nbsp;
King is responding to these,

00:09:18.067 --> 00:09:21.000
these ministers and says,
"We have waited for more

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.500
than 340 years for our
constitutional and God-given

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.600
rights.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.567
The nations of Asia and
Africa are moving with

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.867
jet-like speed
toward gaining political

00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:33.800
independence, but we stiff
creep at horse-and-buggy

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.700
pace--still creep at
horse-and-buggy pace toward

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.400
gaining a cup of
coffee at a lunch counter.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.967
Perhaps it is easy for those
who have never felt the

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:44.700
stinging dark--darts
of segregation to say,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.400
'Wait.' But you--when you
have seen vicious mobs lynch

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.667
your mothers and fathers at
will and drown your sisters

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:54.900
and brothers at whim; when
you have seen hate-filled

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.200
policemen curse, kick
and even kill your black

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.267
brothers and sisters; when
you see the vast majority of

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.867
your twenty million negro
brothers smothering in an

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.467
airtight cage of poverty
in the midst of an affluent

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:09.000
society; when you suddenly
find your tongue twisted and

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.400
your speech stammering as
you seek to explain to your

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.900
six-year-old daughter why
she can't go to the public

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.700
amusement park that has
just been advertised on

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.567
television, and see tears
welling up in her eyes when

00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:21.500
she is told that Funtown is
closed to colored children,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.300
and see ominous clouds of
inferiority beginning to

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.200
form in her
little mental sky,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.367
and see her beginning to
distort her personality by

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:30.367
developing an unconscious
bitterness toward white

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:34.800
people; when you have to
concoct an answer for a

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.600
five-year-old son
who is asking: 'Daddy,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.367
why do white people treat
colored people so mean?';

00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:43.100
when you take a cross-county
drive and find it necessary

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.200
to sleep night after night
in the uncomfortable corners

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.267
of your automobile because
no motel will accept you;

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:50.967
when you are humiliated day
in and day out by nagging

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:53.400
signs reading
'white' and 'colored';

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.500
when your first
name becomes 'nigger,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.400
 your middle name becomes
'boy' however old you are,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.700
and your last
name becomes 'John,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.500
 and your wife and
mother are never given the

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.800
respected title 'Mrs.'; when
you are harried by day and

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.100
hunted--haunted by night
by the fact that you are a

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.767
negro, living
constantly at tiptoe stance,

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.600
never quite knowing
what to expect next,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.900
and are plagued with inner
fears and outer resentments;

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.800
when you, when you
are forever fighting a

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.400
degenerating
sense of 'nobodiness,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.767
 then you will understand
why we find it difficult to

00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:28.967
wait.

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:31.300
There comes a time when
the cup of--cup of endurance

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.200
runs over, and men are no
longer willing to be plunged

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.167
into the abyss of despair.

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.000
I hope, sirs, you can
understand our legitimate

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.300
and unavoidable impatience."

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.167
Years later, James Baldwin,
in the same documentary I

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:49.000
mentioned, is interviewed
by somebody in the early

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.267
seventies, saying, you
know, "You're so angry,

00:11:51.267 --> 00:11:52.267
you're so impatient.

00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:55.500
These changes you're talking
about take time."&nbsp; He shoots

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.867
back, "You say it
takes time.&nbsp; It's taken my

00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:02.267
father's time and
my mother's time,

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:04.567
my brother's and
sister's time,

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:07.000
my grandfather's and
grandmother's time,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.800
my nephew's and niece's
time.&nbsp; How much time do you

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.367
want for your
so-called progress?"

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.000
What is the pace of change?&nbsp;
It's going too fast for

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
white moderates.&nbsp; Not
going nearly fast enough for

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.200
African Americans and white
activists.&nbsp; So King writes

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.300
the "Letter from Birmingham
Jail" over Easter weekend in

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:37.800
1963.&nbsp; Meanwhile, marches
are being organized in

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.367
Birmingham, organized from
the Sixteenth Street Baptist

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:47.400
Church, to try to call
attention to the general

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.900
plight that African
Americans face in

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.900
Birmingham, the injustice,
injustice of the situation.&nbsp;

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:58.800
And Bull Connor
responds, quite famously,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.167
"I want to see
the dogs work,

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.700
 and then, "Look at those
niggers run."&nbsp; As marches

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.800
are organized, he
would release the dogs,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.400
order his deputies to
release the dogs.&nbsp; You've

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.967
seen the images, of course.&nbsp;
Open up the fire cannons.&nbsp;

00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:15.800
They actually had a
tank, a police tank,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.600
that was brought out to
terrorize the citizens.&nbsp; A

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.600
decision is made by King
and his circle to raise the

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.400
stakes.&nbsp; And by
raising the stakes,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:41.400
that means using
children.&nbsp;By the end of the

00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:50.767
first day, children marching
in defiance of orders,

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:56.567
leaving school, a thousand
children aged between six,

00:13:56.567 --> 00:14:00.600
six and eighteen are thrown
in jail.&nbsp; By the next day,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600
the number
doubles.&nbsp; Robert F.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.600
Kennedy, he was leading a
civil rights agenda for his

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400
brother, John F.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.700
Kennedy, Robert F.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.000
Kennedy is beside himself.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.500
He could not believe
that King would risk these

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.900
children's
lives, as he put it,

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.200
for the sake of
more media coverage,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.167
more negative press.&nbsp;
This is what he was doing,

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:29.300
there's no doubt about
it, that King is trying to

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.400
antagonize the situation
and horrify the nation by

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.367
revealing what Bull
Connor would actually do,

00:14:34.367 --> 00:14:35.567
and Bull Connor
took the bait.

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:39.800
He doesn't care.&nbsp; Birmingham
becomes a media circus,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.767
as people from around the
country are horrified at

00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:47.000
what they bear witness to.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
With all the media around, a
truce is negotiated.&nbsp; Lunch

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.300
counters open to blacks,
they become integrated.&nbsp;

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.700
Promises are made
that blacks are going to

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.800
begin--going to get
hired in clerical and sales

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.800
positions, thus avoiding
economic boycotts.&nbsp;But that

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.267
doesn't mean there's
peace.&nbsp; Martin Luther King's

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:23.900
brother's house is bombed.&nbsp;
The hotel that was a staging

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.600
ground for a lot
of the organizers,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.100
who were coming in
from out of town,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.567
the hotel was
bombed.&nbsp; Federal troops,

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:35.567
Robert F.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:36.567
Kennedy
convinces his brother,

00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:38.700
"You've got to bring federal
troops if you want to have

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.400
stability."&nbsp; So federal
troops come and occupy

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.700
Birmingham to keep the
peace.&nbsp; While all of this is

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.800
going on, to speak of
the sort of the heightened

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.600
tension around various
hotspots in the South and

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.100
local and states' rights
versus federal rights,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.100
James Meredith, a
few months earlier,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:08.100
inspired by Kennedy's
election and inauguration,

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:15.500
applies for and is
accepted at Ole Miss,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.167
the flagship
school in Mississippi,

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:21.100
where Mississippi's
elite get trained.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.700
James Meredith, a
black man, of course,

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.700
integrates the school,
but only with federal

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.700
protection, but the federal
protection didn't matter,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.967
since there were riots
on campus surrounding

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:42.900
Meredith's arrival.&nbsp; His
likeness is hung in effigy

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.900
and federal marshals are
killed.&nbsp;George Wallace,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.800
governor of Alabama, who you
saw in an advanced stage of

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.500
his life in the documentary,
who when he was running for

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.400
election earlier in
his career and lost,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.600
when he was a
moderate Democrat,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.500
lost to a race
a, you know, a,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.400
a race-wielding demagogue,
declared earlier that he

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.800
would never be
"out-niggered" again,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.300
and becomes this creature,
spewing racism and populism

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.800
at every turn.&nbsp; Wallace,
at his inauguration,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.600
declares, "Segregation
now, segregation tomorrow,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.600
segregation
forever."&nbsp; In June of '63,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.100
after the riots
in Birmingham,

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.867
Wallace participates in a
staged act of resistance.

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.267
He knows he's going
to lose it already,

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:51.267
but he goes through
this performance,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.867
and he refuses to let the
University of Alabama be

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.567
integrated.&nbsp; And he
literally stands at the

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:02.600
doorway of the, I think,
the registrar's offices,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.300
he's outside of
the building,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.100
refusing to let these two
black students integrate

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.100
University of Alabama.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.467
JFK knew about it.&nbsp; He'd
already dispatched people to

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:14.800
negotiate a situation,
and the federal government,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.367
embodied in I think
is Nick Katzenbach,

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:22.200
essentially gets the
students in the school.&nbsp; So

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.167
the federal government is
now intervening in state

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:30.100
affairs in ways that,
that could lead to,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.067
without exaggeration,
another kind of sectional

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:35.967
crisis.&nbsp;That night, the same
night that Wallace is moved

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:39.700
aside and the University
of Alabama is integrated,

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.700
John F.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.367
Kennedy appears on
national TV.&nbsp; And he asks,

00:18:46.367 --> 00:18:49.600
[clears throat] excuse me,
he asks for Congress to give

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.867
him legislation that would
give everyone the right to

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:57.300
be served in facilities that
are open to the public.&nbsp; He

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.900
declares--essentially asking
for a civil rights bill.&nbsp; He

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.900
declares, and I quote
here, "We are confronted,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.500
excuse me, we are confronted
primarily with a moral

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.567
issue.&nbsp; It is as old as the
scriptures and yet as clear

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:22.600
as the American
Constitution,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.667
 linking the battle
that he wants to fight,

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:28.867
asking Congress to give
him the tools to fight,

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:31.467
a battle that is one, bound
up in the Constitution,

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:35.400
but is also bound up with
fundamental morality and an

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.500
ethical sense of life.&nbsp;
Astonishing for a President

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:48.167
to step out like that, so
astonishing that a man named

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:50.200
Byron de la Beckwith,
a white guy down in

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.300
Mississippi, snaps.&nbsp; And
hours after Kennedy--this is

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.800
broadcast nationally on the
news--hours after Kennedy

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.900
makes this declaration,
Byron de la Beckwith is

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.867
hiding behind some bushes
across the street from

00:20:05.867 --> 00:20:08.467
Medgar Evers's house,
Medgar Evers being the,

00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:09.467
the head of NAACP
in Mississippi.

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:12.700
He wanted to be also
involved in the Southern

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.000
Christian
Leadership Conference,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.967
but they made him
pick and choose,

00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:19.300
so he chose the NAACP.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.600
Byron de la Beckwith
shoots Medgar Evers from a

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.067
high-powered
rifle, kills him,

00:20:25.067 --> 00:20:28.000
the driveway of his home.&nbsp;
Beckwith is not sentenced

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
for thirty-five years.&nbsp;
It's part of a whole other

00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:39.167
conversation we might have
at the end of the course

00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:43.567
about what some might call
a generation in the South

00:20:43.567 --> 00:20:46.067
trying to find
racial healing,

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:48.400
decades after the
events that these atrocities

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.767
happen.&nbsp; So JFK goes on
TV and says the federal

00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:56.400
government needs to respond
to this moral failing in our

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.700
country.&nbsp; Medgar
Evers is murdered.

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:06.100
In due course, a civil
rights bill is introduced

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.800
that would outlaw
segregation in all

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.267
interstate public
accommodations.&nbsp; It would

00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:15.067
allow the attorney general
to initiate suits for school

00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:19.467
integration.&nbsp; And,
very importantly,

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:21.300
it would give the
attorney general power,

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.100
the power to stop funding
for any federal program

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.867
where discrimination is
found to have occurred.&nbsp;

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.600
It's a bill that's
mostly about enforcement,

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.367
saying the federal
government can get involved

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:40.900
via the attorney general
enforcing substantive and

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.900
real change, along the
lines of civil rights.&nbsp;King,

00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:58.000
as the head of
SCLC, leaders of CORE,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.867
Congress of Racial
Equality, NAACP,

00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:04.800
SNCC, the
National Urban League,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.300
come together.&nbsp; It's a group
that squabbles quite a bit,

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.100
but they come together and
they are committed to seeing

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.800
this bill actually
pass.&nbsp; And they declare,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800
much like A.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.867
Philip Randolph--well
exactly like A.

00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:21.067
Philip Randolph declared
some twenty-two years

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:23.200
earlier, they call for
a March on Washington.

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:29.967
Kennedy went
apoplectic.&nbsp; He goes,

00:22:29.967 --> 00:22:34.000
"This kind of agitating is
going to kill any chance

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.867
that the civil rights bill
is going to pass.&nbsp; You have

00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:41.567
to be calm and quiet, you
know.&nbsp; It's not so much a go

00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:44.067
slow mentality,
but just be calm.

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:48.200
Don't agitate.&nbsp; Don't stir
up the water."&nbsp; Kennedy is

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.500
simply horrified.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.400
But the civil rights leaders
have no intention of backing

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.400
down.&nbsp; The march happens at
the very end of August 1963,

00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:02.967
August 28th.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.567
Just over a month
before the march,

00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:10.200
Kennedy relents and
actually endorses it.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.567
So Kennedy's trying
for a solid month,

00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:17.367
month and a half, to get
the march canceled quietly,

00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:19.100
you know, working with these
civil rights leaders.&nbsp; It's

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.767
now quite customary for the
President to be talking with

00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:23.000
civil rights
leaders, something that was

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.500
revolutionary in
1941.&nbsp; You know,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.700
they're now called into the
White House with regularity,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:33.967
or they're just talking to
him on the phone.&nbsp; Kennedy

00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:35.367
realizes they're not
going to back down;

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:39.667
he decides to endorse the
march.&nbsp; But he endorses it

00:23:39.667 --> 00:23:43.267
on a couple of terms: that
the federal government will

00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:49.600
have control over
it, in the sense of,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.000
if things get out of
line, we'll kill the sound

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.667
system.&nbsp; We reserve the
right to look at all the

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:58.400
speeches before they're
actually given.&nbsp; You know,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.467
they, they're saying from a
peace and safety standpoint

00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:05.300
that it's really about
trying to control this march

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.400
so it doesn't get out
of hand in the federal

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:13.500
government's terms.&nbsp; Now
it's important to think of

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.100
the march--we know a
lot about it from our,

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.800
you know, our civics
classes in high school,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.800
and certainly it's part
of our sort of national

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.700
rhetoric of exceptionalism,
but there's a lot of things

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.700
we don't know
about the march,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.700
that they don't talk about.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.500
&nbsp;First of all,
just the name itself,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:36.000
the March on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom.&nbsp; Jobs was

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.867
a major part of the
March on Washington.

00:24:37.867 --> 00:24:41.667
It's not just King standing
up there talking about a

00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:44.267
dream he's having.&nbsp;
It's labor movements,

00:24:44.267 --> 00:24:46.667
religious organizations,
civil rights organizations,

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:50.367
working together, calling
for the passage of the civil

00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:56.900
rights bill, calling for a
two dollar minimum wage,

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.400
calling for the immediate
desegregation of schools,

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.867
calling for a federal
public works program,

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:05.967
along the lines of New Deal
works program I talked about

00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:09.400
a couple of weeks
ago, calling for,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.200
calling for real federal
action to ban discrimination

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.100
in employment, not just
press conferences like the

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.500
FEPC used to do,
but real action.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.667
So the goals of the March
on Washington for Jobs and

00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.200
Freedom, passage of
civil rights bill,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.300
minimum wage,
desegregated schools,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.200
public works program, and
real federal action to ban

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.900
discrimination in
employment.&nbsp;The march is

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.600
remembered, of
course, as a benevolent,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.867
benevolent and
transcendent moment,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.067
but if you've already
done your reading in,

00:25:44.067 --> 00:25:46.900
in the Marable
and Mullings book,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.900
you'll know that the story's
a little more complicated

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.000
than that.&nbsp; John Lewis,
currently representative of

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.800
Congress, then the new head
of the Student Nonviolent

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.000
Coordinating Committee, John
Lewis has a chance to go to

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.367
the microphone, he
prepares a speech,

00:26:05.367 --> 00:26:09.400
the original version of
which is in your text.&nbsp; It

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.367
is not a speech
about love and joy,

00:26:12.367 --> 00:26:14.100
rainbows and unicorns,
and all that kind of lovely

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.267
stuff.&nbsp; It's a speech
that called out on the

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:20.900
Kennedy--blamed the Kennedy
government for its moral

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.900
failings.&nbsp; It
attacked the very hand that,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.667
in a sense, "allowed"
the march to go forward.

00:26:29.667 --> 00:26:31.000
And in many
people's opinions,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.367
even if they
agreed with Lewis,

00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:35.067
they're saying, "There's no
way that you can actually

00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:38.200
say this, cause you will
antagonize to the point,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.500
we will, this will kill
the civil rights bill."

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.167
And Lewis goes, "I'm going
to say what I'm going to

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:47.500
say."&nbsp;As word of that gets
leaked out to people who are

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.200
about to go on
up to the podium,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.067
one of the
religious leaders,

00:26:54.067 --> 00:26:56.200
Cardinal,
Cardinal--whose name,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.200
last name I'm blanking
on.&nbsp; I'm thinking of other

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200
cardinals in the
news for other reasons,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.800
the last few
years--a, a cardinal says,

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.700
"I'll leave the
podium if you say this."

00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:11.000
Walter Reuther
says, "If you say this,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.767
I'm gone."&nbsp; Basically, at
the moment at--just before

00:27:14.767 --> 00:27:18.500
the, the speakers go live,
there's a real chance the

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:24.567
whole thing is going to fall
apart.&nbsp; Lewis finally agrees

00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.400
to give an edited
version of the speech,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.800
and that's the speech that
he gives.&nbsp; And the people

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.700
out in the audience have no
idea about what's happened

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.067
behind stage.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:35.100
They also don't know, mainly
because of what Lewis is

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.567
threatening to do, that
the administration had

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:41.100
positioned agents
by the loudspeakers,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.667
control panels, to kill
the entire sound system,

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.667
to silence the march.&nbsp; And
who knows what would have

00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:52.400
happened, had that actually
gone forward.&nbsp; So the

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.000
narrative behind
the march itself,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.400
and, the, the, the how you
get to the march actually

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.867
happening and what's
actually said there,

00:27:58.867 --> 00:28:02.400
is, is different than what
people normally have been

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.000
taught to consume.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What they've been taught to

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.567
consume is this:
[Martin Luther King,

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:15.600
Jr.:] So even though we face
difficulties of today and

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.167
tomorrow, I
still have a dream.

00:28:19.167 --> 00:28:26.100
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:32.100
I have a dream that one day
this nation will rise up and

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.667
live out the true meaning
of its creed: 'We hold these

00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:45.667
truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created

00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:58.700
equal.' I have a dream that
one day on the red hills of

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:04.300
Georgia, the sons of former
slaves and the sons of

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:09.000
former slave owners will be
able to sit down together at

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.600
the table of brotherhood.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.800
I have a dream that one
day even the state of

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.500
Mississippi, a state
sweltering with the heat of

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.900
injustice, sweltering
with the heat of oppression,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.667
will be transformed into
an oasis of freedom and

00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:32.667
justice.

00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:38.667
I have a dream that my four
little children will one day

00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:44.000
live in a nation where they
will not be judged by the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.567
color of their skin but
by the content of their

00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:47.567
character.

00:29:47.567 --> 00:29:49.967
I have a dream today!"

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.367
You all know these, this
passage.&nbsp; Whether you know

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:59.500
it by heart or not is a
different issue.&nbsp; In a

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.067
couple of weeks, when
we, the course resumes,

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:06.767
when we're getting into the
1980s and nineties and such,

00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:08.700
we'll come back to this last
part of this.&nbsp; I wanted to

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.100
play this main section here,
because the last part is

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.167
actually used for different,
quite different purposes,

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:21.967
as we get into the
1990s, in a new era of,

00:30:21.967 --> 00:30:25.300
sort of race politics, a
confusing era all the same.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.600
But in this moment, this is,
I mean it's gorgeous.&nbsp; This

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.400
beautiful passage about a
person having a reverie

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.567
about possibility, thinking
about a day in which the

00:30:39.567 --> 00:30:41.500
color of their skin is not
going to determine their

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:47.500
life chances.&nbsp; I have no
quarrel with celebrating

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.400
this part of the speech,
certainly.&nbsp; But what of

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:58.700
other parts of the speech?&nbsp;
How come we don't know a

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.567
part, very early on, five
paragraphs into his speech,

00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:05.100
when he says: "In a sense
we've come to our nation's

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.767
capital to cash a check.

00:31:07.767 --> 00:31:09.500
When the architects of
our republic wrote the

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.400
magnificent words of
the Constitution and the

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.700
Declaration of Independence,
they were signing a

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.000
promissory note to which
every American was to fall

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.400
heir.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.100
This note was a
promise that all men,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.300
yes, black men as
well as white men,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.500
would be guaranteed the
'unalienable Rights' of

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.100
Law--of 'Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness.'

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.700
It is obvious today that
America has defaulted on

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.067
this promissory note,
insofar as her citizens of

00:31:35.067 --> 00:31:36.067
color are concerned.

00:31:36.067 --> 00:31:39.300
Instead of honoring
this sacred obligation,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.900
America has given the
Negro people a bad check,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.600
a check which has come
back marked 'insufficient

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.367
funds.'" That's a very--I
mean imagine if that was the

00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:53.200
message that we grew up
in our elementary schools

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.667
listening to in
black history month,

00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:57.400
as we all know, it's been
trotted out during that

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.767
particular month.&nbsp; That's a
very different message to

00:32:00.767 --> 00:32:03.900
walk away from with the
March on Washington: America

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.667
has failed on its promise to
provide equality for all its

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:12.700
citizens, and it's couched
in the terms of capital.&nbsp;

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.000
Significantly different
speech if you just excerpt

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
that part.&nbsp; Or, what if
you excerpted this part?

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:27.900
[Martin Luther King, Jr.:]
We can never be satisfied as

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.300
long as the Negro is the
victim of the unspeakable

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.800
horrors of police brutality.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.900
We can never be satisfied
as long as our bodies,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.100
heavy with the
fatigue of travel,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.467
cannot gain lodging in the
motels of the highways and

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:53.200
the hotels of the cities.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.800
We cannot be satisfied as
long as the Negro's basic

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.567
mobility is from a smaller
ghetto to a larger one.

00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:06.400
We can never be satisfied
as long as our children are

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.967
stripped of their selfhood
and robbed of their dignity

00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:15.967
by signs stating: 'For
Whites Only.' We cannot be

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.067
satisfied as long as a Negro
in Mississippi cannot vote

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:28.167
and a Negro in New York
believes he has nothing for

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.167
which to vote.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.800
No, no, we are
not satisfied,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.100
and we will not be satisfied
until 'justice rolls down

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.800
like waters, and
righteousness like a mighty

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.000
stream.'" Now that's in
the middle of his speech,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.267
as he's preparing for the
crescendo that would turn

00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:56.900
into the "I Have a Dream"
sort of call and response,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.400
in a sense.&nbsp; So you have a
King in the earliest part of

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.100
this speech talking about
the failures of the American

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.867
republic to abide by its own
Declaration of Independence

00:34:06.867 --> 00:34:10.967
and its own Constitution.&nbsp;
The message hasn't changed

00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:14.000
from the night before
the March on--excuse me,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.400
the Montgomery bus
boycott, when King says,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.767
"If we're wrong in all
of what we're doing,

00:34:18.767 --> 00:34:20.900
the Supreme Court is wrong
and the Constitution is

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.900
wrong."

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.867
He's calling for the country
to live up to its legal

00:34:23.867 --> 00:34:29.067
mandates and, of course, its
ethical mandates as well.&nbsp;

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.000
And he's also, although
he certainly abides by the

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
philosophy of
turning the other cheek,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.300
it should not be allowed to
be mistaken for sort of the

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.400
positive and hopeful reverie
of the "I Have a Dream

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.067
moment."&nbsp; He is saying
we cannot be satisfied,

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:48.867
we cannot stop,
harkening back,

00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:50.367
I think, to Du Bois who--W.

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:51.367
E.

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:52.367
B.

00:34:52.367 --> 00:34:53.367
Du Bois, who died the
day before the March on

00:34:53.367 --> 00:34:55.400
Washington.&nbsp; Talk
about, sort of,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.300
theatrical timing, not to
make light of it.&nbsp; It's

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.300
rather astonishing though.&nbsp;
He died an expatriate in

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.100
Ghana, having essentially
been kicked out of--well

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.200
kicked himself
out of the country,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.167
after the country took
his passport for a while,

00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:15.200
for his alleged Communist
sympathizing.&nbsp; But Du Bois

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.567
was talking
about "returning,

00:35:16.567 --> 00:35:19.700
returning from fighting,
returning fighting" and King

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.500
is saying the same thing,
"We can never be satisfied,

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.400
 as long as you can't vote
in Mississippi and as long

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.500
as there's no reason to
vote in New York.&nbsp; And he's

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.767
harkening, by the
way, at that moment,

00:35:29.767 --> 00:35:31.500
to the fact that--you know,
I've been talking about the

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.567
South a lot, and I will be
talking about the South some

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:35.000
more.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.067
But as we'll see later
in a couple of weeks,

00:35:39.067 --> 00:35:41.967
this is a national problem.&nbsp;
It's just articulated in

00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:46.300
different ways.&nbsp; So what
would the narrative of the

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.300
"I Have a Dream" speech be,
if the title was: "We Can

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:57.700
Never Be Satisfied"?&nbsp;
Or if the title were:

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.100
"Insufficient Funds"?&nbsp;
That's a different kind of

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.300
speech.&nbsp; And we need to
think about the consequences

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.800
of these naming conventions,
of these excerpting

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.400
conventions, of these
ways that we learn about

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.200
individuals like King who
become mythic for every good

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.600
reason, I don't
want to dismiss it,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.100
but become something other
than what they might have

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.500
been, if you just
looked at their rhetoric,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
looked at their approach in
a slightly different angle.&nbsp;

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.467
All that said, there's no
denying the fact that right

00:36:31.467 --> 00:36:34.767
after the march, there was
this sort of giddy feeling

00:36:34.767 --> 00:36:38.800
of hope, of benevolence,
of transcendence.&nbsp; I can't

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.400
rewrite history that way.&nbsp;
There's a sense of real

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.967
change in the air, the
change that is shattered or,

00:36:46.967 --> 00:36:51.967
excuse me, a sense that is
shattered two weeks later

00:36:51.967 --> 00:36:54.800
when those four little
girls are blown to bits in

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800
Birmingham.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:04.700
Now the King you hear in "I
Have a Dream" or--speech or

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.700
Montgomery bus
boycott speech,

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:12.700
is a King who is
buoyant, hopeful,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.300
angry perhaps,
concerned, but with a,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.367
a narrative power that
suggests possibility in a

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:25.467
positive way.&nbsp; Let me play
a clip of a different King.

00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.867
[Martin Luther King,
Jr.:]"These children,

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:40.700
unoffending,
innocent, and beautiful,

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:45.200
were the victims of one of
the most vicious and tragic

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.467
crimes ever perpetrated
against humanity.

00:37:50.467 --> 00:37:55.167
And yet they died nobly.

00:37:55.167 --> 00:38:01.167
They are the martyred
heroines of a holy crusade

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.067
for freedom and
human dignity.

00:38:06.067 --> 00:38:11.100
And so this afternoon in
a real sense they have

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.600
something to say to
each of us in their death.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.700
They have something to say
to every minister of the

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:26.467
gospel who has remained
silent behind the safe

00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:29.567
security of
stained-glass windows.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.600
They have something to say
to every politician who has

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.100
fed his constituents with
the stale bread of hatred

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.300
and the spoiled
meat of racism.

00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:50.700
They have something to say
to a federal government that

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.867
has compromised with the
undemocratic practices of

00:38:55.867 --> 00:39:00.500
southern Dixiecrats and
the blatant hypocrisy of

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.400
right-wing
northern Republicans.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.400
They have something to
say to every Negro who has

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:15.200
passively accepted the evil
system of segregation and

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.400
who has stood on the
sidelines in a mighty

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.400
struggle for justice.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.400
They say to each of us,
black and white alike,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.367
that we must substitute
courage for caution.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.300
They say to us that we
must be concerned not merely

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.867
about who murdered
them, but about the system,

00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:42.900
the way of life, the
philosophy which produced

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.500
the murderers.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.700
Their death says to us that
we must work passionately

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.400
and unrelentingly for the
realization of the American

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.400
dream.&nbsp; And so my friends,
they did not die in vain."

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:11.067
King giving the eulogy at
the funeral honoring the

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:12.500
four young girls
who were blown,

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.367
blown, blown up.&nbsp; This is
a King you don't hear much

00:40:16.367 --> 00:40:19.167
about, a King
who's despairing,

00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:25.167
who's exhausted, and feels
hopeless.&nbsp; It's important to

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.200
know that King ran through
the whole vector of human

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:37.200
emotion, certainly, and was
on more than one occasion

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200
pushed to the
limits.&nbsp; Other people,

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.200
of course,
pushed to the limits,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.900
acting out in different
kinds of ways.&nbsp; I began

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.800
today's lecture playing
a clip from "We Shall

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.400
Overcome," a song talking
about--I mean doesn't take

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.067
much to read into
it--overcoming those moments

00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:03.867
when you are taxed beyond
belief.&nbsp; It's an anthem of

00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:07.100
the movement; it's a very
important song.&nbsp; We know

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.600
it.&nbsp; Even if you
don't know the words,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.100
you can fake sing
through it.&nbsp; You know,

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.100
people next to you can
sing a little louder,

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.367
cover up the fact you don't
know what the next line is.&nbsp;

00:41:15.367 --> 00:41:16.700
But you know how
the tune goes,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.967
right?&nbsp; But we don't hear
about other artists offering

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:25.400
different interpretations of
this moment.&nbsp; After the four

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.400
young women are
blown up, Nina Simone,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.600
a famous jazz artist,
produces a protest song.&nbsp; It

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.900
becomes one of her
signature pieces,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.900
much like Billie Holiday's
"Strange Fruit."&nbsp; It's a

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.900
very long song.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:41.900
I'm going to play, you know,
a portion of it.&nbsp; The lyrics

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:49.000
should be clear enough, but
I'll actually show them up

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.800
here as well.&nbsp; It's
called "Mississippi Goddam."

00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.800
[Nina Simone: (singing)]
"Alabama's gotten me so

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.700
upset, Tennessee
made me lose my rest,

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.300
And everybody knows
about Mississippi Goddam,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:10.300
This is a show tune, But the
show hasn't been written for

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.700
it, yet, Hound
dogs on my trail,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.667
School children
sitting in jail,

00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:30.067
Black cat cross my path, I
think every day's gonna be

00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:36.067
my last, Lord have
mercy on this land of mine,

00:42:40.467 --> 00:42:43.100
We all gonna get
it in due time,

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:49.400
I don't belong here,
I don't belong there,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.067
I've even stopped
believing in prayer,

00:42:54.067 --> 00:43:01.200
Don't tell me, I tell you,
Me and my people just about

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.400
due, I've been
there so I know,

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.200
They keep on saying 'Go
slow!' But that's just the

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.300
trouble, 'do it slow',
Washing the windows,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.300
'do it slow',
Picking the cotton,

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.300
'do it slow', You're
just plain rotten,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.300
'do it slow',
You're too damn lazy,

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300
'do it slow', The
thinking's crazy,

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.300
'do it slow',
Where am I going,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.300
What am I
doing, I don't know,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.767
I don't know, Just try
to do your very best,

00:43:16.767 --> 00:43:17.967
Stand up be counted
with all the rest,

00:43:17.967 --> 00:43:18.967
For everybody knows
about Mississippi Goddam,

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:20.200
I made you thought I
was kiddin' didn't we.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200
Picket lines,
School boycotts,

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200
They try to say
it's a communist plot,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.667
All I want is equality,
for my sister my brother my

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.300
people and me, Yes you
lied to me all these years,

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.600
You told me to wash
and clean my ears,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.800
And talk real fine
just like a lady,

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.900
And you'd stop
calling me Sister Sadie,

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.200
Oh but this whole
country is full of lies,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.400
You're all gonna die
and die like flies,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.100
I don't trust you any
more, You keep on saying 'Go

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.267
slow!' 'Go slow!' But
that's just the trouble,

00:43:34.267 --> 00:43:35.300
'do it slow',
Desegregation, 'do it slow',

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.300
Mass
participation, 'do it slow',

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.300
Reunification, 'do it
slow', Do things gradually,

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.300
'do it slow', But
bring more tragedy,

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.900
'do it slow', Why
don't you see it,

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:46.900
Why don't you feel
it, I don't know,

00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:11.067
I don't know, You don't
have to live next to me,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.200
Just give me my equality,
Everybody knows about

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:08.300
Mississippi, Everybody
knows about Alabama,

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:23.400
Everybody knows about
Mississippi Goddam.

00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:39.700
That's it!"

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.300
Now it's a genius
song, and since it,

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.700
you know, it's played to the
tune of a bouncy show tune

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.967
and she was known
for doing, you know,

00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:46.667
jazz standards
and her own songs,

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:49.000
playing the American
songbook.&nbsp; And then she's

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.500
telling her largely white
audiences to go to hell.&nbsp;

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.400
And they ate it
up.&nbsp; That, you know,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.200
she's calling the people
who expected civil rights

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.467
activists to be respectable,
wash behind their ears,

00:46:04.467 --> 00:46:08.267
to hell with that as well.&nbsp;
And the beloved country that

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:11.700
King is talking about, that
can go to hell as well.&nbsp; In

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.500
fact, it is going to hell,
because they just blew up

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.400
four children and no
one's going to pay the

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.600
consequences for it.&nbsp; This
is an important narrative of

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.600
the civil rights movement.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.267
You need to understand
it.&nbsp; And you also need to

00:46:23.267 --> 00:46:26.200
understand the fact
that it's dropped out,

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.667
and that's really the,
the significance of it all,

00:46:29.667 --> 00:46:31.600
is that we know certain
things about the movement

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.667
and not others, and we need
to ask the question why.&nbsp;

00:46:37.167 --> 00:46:39.300
That brings to close my
lecture.&nbsp; The TAs are going

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.400
to fan out a little
separately over here to

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.200
distribute your papers and
your midterm exams.&nbsp; And

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.900
even though I know you
have other classes to go to,

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.600
I wish you a
lovely spring break.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.600
Thanks.

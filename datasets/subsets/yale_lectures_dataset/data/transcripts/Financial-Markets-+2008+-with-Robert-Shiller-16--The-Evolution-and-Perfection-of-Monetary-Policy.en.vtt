00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.862
Professor Robert
Shiller: I want to talk

00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:08.103
today about monetary policy.
First though,

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:12.645
I wanted to just review some
thoughts about Carl Icahn,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.770
who spoke on Monday.
I thought he was very amusing.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.696
I'm again happy that you asked
questions because that's when

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:24.870
you bring out a speaker really
well.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.190
I thought you could have given
him more trouble.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.037
He is a controversial figure.
What he does,

00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:33.418
as you know,
is takes over a company and

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:36.278
shakes them up and,
in some cases,

00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:39.920
is accused of stripping their
assets.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.235
But, it's all legal and you
could make an argument that it's

00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:50.190
in a general good of our society
that people do that.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.990
If a company--if its stock
sells for less than its assets

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.790
are worth, then the company
maybe should be broken up and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.591
the assets taken and given
somewhere else because the low

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:06.791
stock price indicates a problem.
I don't know how to evaluate

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:12.128
everything Icahn has done,
but some corporate raiders have

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:16.583
been unkind to employees.
Maybe it's not always the

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:19.253
raider;
it's that some employees had

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:23.867
trusted in an implicit contract
that they were offered by their

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.633
employer.
For example,

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.566
the employer may have said
verbally--or suggested to an

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.136
employee--that if you do well,
we'll promote you up and you

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.540
will have various advantages in
the future.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.904
Then an outside raider comes in
and just fires the employee,

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:43.300
so naturally the employee feels
wronged.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.560
There are instances of that
sort of thing.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.813
Again, it's like anyone who
does important things,

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:59.245
it's hard to judge the whole
picture and on that I am sure he

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:03.320
has created value for the
economy.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.965
Someone suggested that we
should bring in corporate

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:16.099
regulators as well.
I think maybe in the next year

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.963
I'll do that to offset--I'm
bringing in a lot of very

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:24.645
successful finance practitioners
and I don't have any regulators

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:29.546
this year.
Also, one of you asked,

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:36.330
what literature do you read?
He mentioned the Nicomachean

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.479
Ethics, which I have never
read--I don't know what that is.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.833
He also mentioned a poem by
Rudyard Kipling called

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:48.189
If.
I didn't recognize what he was

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.310
referring to immediately,
but I looked it up and it's a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.508
famous poem that you must have
seen--written in 1910--an

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.742
inspirational poem.
I put it up on the ClassesV2,

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:05.463
not as part of the reading
list, but it's under Resources,

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:09.625
so you can read Kipling.
Maybe he thought of that

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:13.477
because it's really a
poem--seems to be a poem of

00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:18.533
advice for young people because
it ends up--the last line is--do

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:22.150
you know the last line?
Can someone recite it?

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.761
What's the last line?
"If you follow these

00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:31.409
instructions,
you will be a man my son."

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.821
So, that's the mode of thought
he may have been in when he

00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:38.488
talked.
Anyway, we have our second

00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:45.948
mid-term exam on Monday and it
will be like the first mid-term,

00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:50.280
but it will be less
mathematical.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.537
This part of the course had
less technical apparatus than

00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:57.223
the first part of the course,
so it will concentrate on the

00:03:57.223 --> 00:04:00.340
middle third of the course,
up to this lecture.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.701
You have to read Fabozzi, et al.
again carefully because I'm

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:13.075
free to take anything from Key
Terms and Key Concepts from the

00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:19.240
chapters that were assigned for
this part of the course.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.709
Of course, every reading that
is online--I don't expect you to

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:27.520
go to the library--is something
I might ask about.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.545
April eleventh,
we have Stephen Schwarzman

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.810
coming and I'm looking forward
to that.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.779
That will again be a Friday,
but it will be at nine o'clock

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.823
and he will be here,
so I think that will be a lot

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:52.353
of fun also.
I want to then start today's

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:58.326
talk–lecture--which is
about monetary policy and it's

00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:03.770
really apropos right now.
We are living in very unusual

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.980
times and I am sure that Ben
Bernanke and other central bank

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.189
presidents are losing sleep
right now because this is a time

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.810
to challenge monetary policy
makers.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.362
The thing that really emerged
just in the last week or so is

00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:27.126
that--of course,
monetary policy is about

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:31.343
setting of interest rates.
In the last week,

00:05:31.343 --> 00:05:36.344
the Treasury bill rate on the
United States four-week Treasury

00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:38.980
bill,
which is the standard,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.850
essentially--three-month--it
fell to 0.2%.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.339
This is shocking.
What is happening now?

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:53.259
Interest rates have hit
zero--0.2%;

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.360
that's twenty basis points
above zero.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.195
People have long thought that
these kinds of things happen

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.699
only in Japan,
but that's not true at all;

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.720
it's happening right now in the
U.S.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.798
There's been a total crash in
Treasury bill rates,

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:20.017
so it's not going to--one thing
we know is that this crash is

00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:22.754
over.
The Treasury bill--the

00:06:22.754 --> 00:06:27.427
three-month Treasury bill rate
has crashed--it's virtually

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:32.430
zero--and the story is over
because it can't go any lower.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.810
Well, it could go twenty basis
points lower,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.190
but interest rates can never be
negative.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.030
So, that's it;
it's over;

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.427
we've just hit zero.
This is the thing that worries

00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:46.710
central bankers.
When interest rates hit zero,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.761
then they don't have--it's a
little bit like your steering

00:06:50.761 --> 00:06:54.314
system on your car freezing up
or hitting a--you're

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:57.996
hydroplaning on the highway;
your steering wheel doesn't

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:00.517
work anymore.
Once interest rates hit zero,

00:07:00.517 --> 00:07:04.550
you can't cut them anymore and
that's what the Fed wants to do.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.459
I'm talking about four-week
Treasury bills;

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:12.835
the Federal Funds Rate is still
at 2 ¼%,

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:19.847
but at least the more prominent
three-month T-bill rate is at

00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:23.695
the end.
What I want to do is talk about

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:28.350
what the Fed in this country is
doing and what other central

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.838
banks are doing.
I want to start by putting it

00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:35.828
in historical perspective.
If you'll allow me,

00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:41.567
I will talk first about just
what is a central bank,

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:47.420
such as the Federal Reserve,
and what do they do.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.219
I want to first just go
back--the story I told you in a

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:56.930
recent lecture was the story of
a goldsmith banker.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.460
This is how it started.
There were people--goldsmiths

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.100
were people who worked in the
metal gold and made beautiful

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.050
things for people--jewelry and
other things.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.559
They had safes in their shop
and some people would say to the

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.189
goldsmith, I have some
valuables.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.940
I don't have a safe--can I put
it in your safe?

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.868
The goldsmith would say, okay.
Then he'd write on a little

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.410
note and hand it to the guy and
say, just keep this note.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.162
If it was a bearer note--if the
note said, I'll pay--if it

00:08:28.162 --> 00:08:30.730
wasn't a unique object but just
gold,

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.409
the note would say that this
goldsmith will pay to the bearer

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.870
so many ounces of gold.
And that's how banking got

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.474
started.
It emerged into an institution

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:50.450
in which banks would have
notes--bank notes--that

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:57.919
circulated widely and we began
to think of them as money.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:00.731
If you put your gold in the
care of a goldsmith,

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:04.200
initially you don't think--you
think the money is there.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.957
But eventually,
you have this bearer note that

00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:10.451
you start passing around to
spend to other people and they

00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:13.821
start to think of them as money
and that's the origin of

00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:16.307
banking.
If you ask someone a couple

00:09:16.307 --> 00:09:19.259
hundred years ago,
what's the essence of a bank?

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:21.953
They would say,
oh they print paper

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:26.547
money--private banks print paper
money, not just government

00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:28.661
banks.
Well, there weren't government

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:30.653
banks;
originally, they were all

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:34.215
private.
There is an institution called

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:40.323
the "gold standard"--now totally
and completely gone everywhere

00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:43.986
in the world.
What it was--it began--the

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:48.640
first country to adopt the gold
standard officially was the

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.769
United Kingdom and that was in
1717.

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:56.889
What it meant was that the
government of the U.K.

00:09:56.889 --> 00:10:01.192
committed that their paper
money would always and at all

00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:06.018
times be redeemable in gold.
It was gradually adopted by

00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:11.158
other countries through time and
the United States didn't

00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:14.280
officially adopt it until 1900.

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:25.379
Let me just go back to the way
the thing worked.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:27.992
It used to be that it
was–actually,

00:10:27.992 --> 00:10:31.650
the gold standard kind of came
in by accident in England,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.980
originally;
that was in the 1600s.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.855
The prominent coin was called
the shilling and it was a silver

00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:40.136
coin.
The British pound was twenty

00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:43.482
shillings, so effectively,
the pound was on a silver

00:10:43.482 --> 00:10:46.038
standard.
Then they started minting new

00:10:46.038 --> 00:10:48.905
coins out of gold and the
government was issuing

00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:52.863
coins--they called them guineas.
They started out as a--they

00:10:52.863 --> 00:10:56.713
just minted the amount in one
coin, which they thought was

00:10:56.713 --> 00:11:00.457
equivalent to twenty shillings.
So, they had a guinea,

00:11:00.457 --> 00:11:04.141
which they said was twenty
shillings, and then there were

00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:08.088
two coins--either shillings or
guineas--that was the money at

00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:10.869
the time.
Then, the problem was that the

00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:14.712
price--relative price of those
two--was not really fixed by the

00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:17.139
government.
So, it started to drift and

00:11:17.139 --> 00:11:20.259
people started to think,
I think a guinea is worth more

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:23.437
than twenty shillings and the
market price drifted up to

00:11:23.437 --> 00:11:26.791
twenty-one shillings.
So, the government was

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:29.892
upset--of the U.K.
We wanted this to be a twenty

00:11:29.892 --> 00:11:31.964
shilling coin,
but now in the market it's

00:11:31.964 --> 00:11:34.962
trading at twenty-one.
Then they implemented a rule

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:37.820
that the guinea is worth
twenty-one shillings.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.163
Then, the relative price of
gold versus silver shifted to

00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:49.271
the point that the gold with--at
the twenty-one shilling exchange

00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:51.779
rate,
the gold shilling was worth

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:55.629
less--the gold guinea was worth
less than twenty-one shilling.

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:59.185
So, all the shillings
disappeared and the only coin

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:03.434
left was the guinea.
So, England became on the gold

00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:08.658
standard.
The Bank of England was founded

00:12:08.658 --> 00:12:16.059
in 1694 and that was the world's
first central bank.

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:22.010
It was granted a monopoly on
joint stock banking by

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:29.389
Parliament in return for giving
war loans to the government.

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:33.009
It started out just a powerful
bank.

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:37.970
It did not have a government
monopoly on note issue,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.541
but over the time,
it became the prime issuer of

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:44.000
U.K.
notes.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.286
Now, what actually developed in
the 1700s was that the Bank of

00:12:48.286 --> 00:12:51.870
England, being the most powerful
bank in England,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.338
started to demand that other
banks in the U.K.,

00:12:55.338 --> 00:13:00.795
who were also issuing notes,
would leave their--would keep a

00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:04.299
deposit with the Bank of
England.

00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:07.756
The Bank of England--if you
were a little bank somewhere in

00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:10.259
the U.K., the Bank of England
would say,

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:16.105
you've got to keep a deposit
with us, otherwise we'll destroy

00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:18.281
you.
Because the Bank of England

00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:21.760
could then demand all the--it
could start accumulating notes

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.179
from some issuing bank and then
demand payment in gold.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:29.704
The issuing bank would be
driven out of business if it

00:13:29.704 --> 00:13:34.570
didn't--They all were using
fractional reserve banking,

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.317
so if you have a big player
that's demanding gold from you,

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:42.653
you're in trouble.
All the banks complied and kept

00:13:42.653 --> 00:13:46.090
deposits with the Bank of
England.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.461
You see what the Bank of
England emerged into was a

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:52.409
banker's bank.
You have lots of banks;

00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:55.936
the banks are taking in gold
and issuing notes,

00:13:55.936 --> 00:14:00.690
but they are forced by the Bank
of England to keep a deposit at

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.509
the Bank of England.
So, the Bank of England then

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:08.610
became a kind of regulator of
these banks and it would also

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.580
loan to them when they were in
trouble.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.730
They had a relationship,
between the Bank of England.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.279
The Bank of England became the
source of stability in the UK.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:23.469
The problem with private banks
issuing notes is that there

00:14:23.469 --> 00:14:28.931
would periodically be banking
crises when the banks failed to

00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:34.120
pay on their notes and they
couldn't pay out the gold that

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.245
was demanded--that was required.
With a fractional reserve

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.110
system, you're in an unstable
equilibrium.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.458
If people start demanding
payment on their notes,

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:49.720
then they will destroy the
system.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.690
If they start demanding,
then we're in trouble.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.927
So, the Bank of England
effectively enforced that the

00:14:58.927 --> 00:15:03.979
banks in England kept adequate
reserves and they would see some

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:08.950
of these reserves in the
deposits at the Bank of England.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:18.159
England's money was more stable
than other countries.

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:23.741
In the United States,
we did not have a central bank

00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:29.870
until 1913 when we created the
Federal Reserve System.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.071
Before that,
the United States went through

00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:37.644
repeated banking crises when
people would start demanding the

00:15:37.644 --> 00:15:43.815
gold for their notes.
When did we have--we had a

00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:52.017
severe banking crisis in the
United States in 1797,

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:57.594
in 1819, in 1837,
in 1857, in 1873,

00:15:57.594 --> 00:16:04.009
in 1893, and in 1907.
We just had one after another;

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:06.129
the banking system kept
collapsing.

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:08.529
What would happen is there
would be a panic;

00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:10.781
people would say,
they're not paying on the

00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:13.485
notes.
So, everyone would run to the

00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:17.027
bank and demand their money.
When that happened,

00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:21.486
it would destroy the economy.
It was a subject of much

00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:26.909
discussion of what to do to
prevent these bank runs.

00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:35.238
In the United States,
in Massachusetts,

00:16:35.238 --> 00:16:48.827
a bank called the Suffolk Bank
created a little Bank of England

00:16:48.827 --> 00:16:59.546
in the State of Massachusetts.
They created what was called

00:16:59.546 --> 00:17:02.929
the Suffolk System,
in 1819.

00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:06.372
What the Suffolk Bank did is it
just, on its own,

00:17:06.372 --> 00:17:10.316
it just declared that it was
the Bank of England for the

00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:14.547
State of Massachusetts and it
required that all banks in the

00:17:14.547 --> 00:17:17.559
Boston area keep deposits with
them.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:24.726
So, the Suffolk Bank became a
banker's bank and it lasted

00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:28.603
until 1860.
It then made Massachusetts the

00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:32.146
most stable state,
or essentially the most stable

00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:35.910
state, in the country and it was
widely-admired.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.450
The thing you have to
understand is,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:45.419
if you could go back in a time
machine to before 1860 in the

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:49.197
United States,
you would have real problems

00:17:49.197 --> 00:17:53.460
with paper money and you would
be very much aware of the paper

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.886
money.
If you took out your wallet and

00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:59.306
looked at the paper money in
your wallet, it would be issued

00:17:59.306 --> 00:18:02.609
by lots of different banks,
not any one standard bank.

00:18:02.609 --> 00:18:07.588
If you went to a store to buy
something with paper money,

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:12.390
then the person at the--would
it be a cash register?

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.420
What did they have?
Cash box would be--would have

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.156
something called--it was called,
Van Court's Bank Note

00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:23.690
Reporter and Counterfeit
Detector [sic].

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.025
It was a magazine that would
be--every retailer would

00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:30.345
subscribe to it.
So, what the guy would do is he

00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:34.467
would say, okay you've got--if
it was local money--if it was

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:38.379
from this town--if it was New
Haven money--there were New

00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:42.011
Haven banks--the guy would
immediately know what it's

00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:44.401
worth.
But, if you were to make the

00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:47.259
mistake of trying to spend
Boston money in New Haven,

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.336
they would get out Van Court's
and then they would read the

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:52.671
discount.
So, Boston money was probably

00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:55.147
pretty good because of the
Suffolk System,

00:18:55.147 --> 00:18:58.589
but if you tried spending New
York money in New Haven,

00:18:58.589 --> 00:19:01.882
they would get out the Bank
Note Reporter [sic]

00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:05.045
and put a discount on it.
Well, it was a messy system,

00:19:05.045 --> 00:19:07.750
so you'd only get like ninety
cents on the dollar.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.025
That's because nobody trusted
these banks, they could go under

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.600
any day and so they tended to
sell at a discount.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.266
Incidentally, the U.S.
did create what sounded like

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.739
central banks.
They were The First Bank of the

00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:28.990
United States and The Second
Bank of the United States.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:34.291
The First Bank of the United
States was created in 1791 and

00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:39.410
they had a twenty-year charter,
which expired in 1811.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.759
It wasn't immediately renewed
because the United States got

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:46.910
into a war that we call The War
of 1812.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.940
It was the U.S.
connection to the Napoleonic

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.264
Wars.
It wasn't until after the war

00:19:52.264 --> 00:19:56.093
that we created a new Bank of
the United States in 1816 and

00:19:56.093 --> 00:19:58.799
gave it a twenty-year charter as
well.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:21.743
But those were not central
banks because they--there was--

00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:40.259
[Speaker arrangements]
In the United States,

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:46.048
we created the National Banking
System in 1863 after a banking

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:49.559
crisis and that worked fairly
well.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:53.299
Instead of having a central
bank, we decided that there

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:56.970
would be a list of banks called
the National Banks.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:03.059
The National Banks would be
required to help bail out any

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:07.813
bank that was failing.
It was something like a central

00:21:07.813 --> 00:21:11.822
bank, but it was different
essentially in that the National

00:21:11.822 --> 00:21:15.210
Banks really didn't have
authority to run monetary

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.130
policy.
They merely were there in a

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.700
time of emergency to prevent,
hopefully, a banking crisis.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.386
They didn't succeed;
we still had banking crises,

00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:29.130
so the system didn't seem to
work very well.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.384
The 1907 banking crisis then
led finally to the creation of

00:21:33.384 --> 00:21:37.640
the system that we have now--the
Federal Reserve System.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.775
What it was was,
in many ways,

00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:44.339
an effort to bring the Bank of
England to the United States.

00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:47.077
They wouldn't have said that
because it doesn't sound--we

00:21:47.077 --> 00:21:49.180
want to think that we invented
this here,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.507
but it actually was a new
invention in a way because the

00:21:53.507 --> 00:21:56.890
United States has a different
philosophy,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.717
which the United States has
been committed,

00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:04.089
since its beginning,
to federalism.

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:07.543
That is, they don't want--or
more broadly--they don't want

00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:10.210
centralization of power in the
government.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.987
Instead of setting up a central
bank in the United States,

00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:19.764
as was done commonly in other
countries, the United States

00:22:19.764 --> 00:22:24.039
instead created twelve banks;
they're the twelve Federal

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:27.361
Reserve Banks.
That was an effort to disburse

00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:32.171
power away from the center.
The idea was that power to the

00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:35.869
people, rather than the central
government.

00:22:35.869 --> 00:22:41.630
The Federal Reserve System that
was created in 1913 was

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.789
different in that it was
independent,

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:49.343
or much more independent than
central banks in other

00:22:49.343 --> 00:22:52.534
countries.
Other countries had set up

00:22:52.534 --> 00:22:56.701
central banks following on the
Bank of England,

00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:59.829
but the U.S.
didn't set up a central bank;

00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:03.910
it set up a system of twelve
banks and they were regional.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.380
The idea was that this is
better, it's more democratic;

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.859
each region of the United
States has its own bank.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:17.704
The banks were not technically
government institutions--well,

00:23:17.704 --> 00:23:21.089
they're semi-government;
it's kind of strange set-up.

00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:28.717
The Federal Reserve Banks are
owned not by the government but

00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:34.820
by the banks in the region where
they operate;

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.603
they're called member banks.
So, banks that become a member

00:23:38.603 --> 00:23:42.256
of the Federal Reserve System
get shares and they become

00:23:42.256 --> 00:23:45.180
stockholders in the Federal
Reserve Bank.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.440
They get dividends--does it
work now?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:57.201
Can I walk away?
Thank you.--but they're not

00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:00.621
traded.
There's no price per share that

00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:03.836
you can observe and the banks
can't do anything except

00:24:03.836 --> 00:24:07.406
passively receive the dividend.
But they can also participate

00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:10.366
in choosing the directors and
the president of the Federal

00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:14.422
Reserve Banks.
That's a very dispersed system,

00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:20.050
but it still works because
member banks keep deposits at

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:26.087
the Federal Reserve Banks and
they're required to keep these

00:24:26.087 --> 00:24:29.564
deposits.
Moreover, they can also borrow

00:24:29.564 --> 00:24:33.790
from the Federal Reserve Banks
when they're in trouble and need

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:37.880
money and that's supposed to
help prevent banking crises.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.039
So, that's the Federal Reserve
System.

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:44.018
Incidentally,
there are twelve banks and

00:24:44.018 --> 00:24:48.067
there are twelve districts.
The districts back in 1913

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:53.023
represented the population
distribution of the U.S.

00:24:53.023 --> 00:24:57.059
at that time.
There are a lot more districts

00:24:57.059 --> 00:25:00.369
in the East Coast of the U.S.
than the West Coast.

00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:03.775
There are also two Federal
Reserve Banks in one--in the

00:25:03.775 --> 00:25:07.621
state of Missouri--the Federal
Reserve Bank of Kansas City and

00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:10.269
the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis.

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:13.536
You wonder, why would it be
that the whole western half of

00:25:13.536 --> 00:25:16.282
the U.S.
gets only--or the western third

00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:20.347
of the U.S.--gets only one
Federal Reserve Bank--that's San

00:25:20.347 --> 00:25:22.869
Francisco--but Missouri gets
two.

00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:24.809
That's kind of political
history;

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:27.329
it's kind of absurd,
but that's the way it is.

00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:33.299
The real difference between
Federal Reserve Bank System of

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:38.640
1913--the most important
difference--and the Federal

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.819
Reserve System of today is that
we are no longer on the gold

00:25:44.819 --> 00:25:49.307
standard.
The Federal Reserve System was

00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:54.559
a gold standard institution like
the Bank of England.

00:25:54.559 --> 00:26:00.760
It was supposed to maintain the
convertibility of the currency

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.195
into gold.
Under the gold standard,

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:10.011
your dollar bill represented so
many ounces of gold and you were

00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:14.349
supposed to be able to always
get that gold.

00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:19.441
That means you could go to a
bank and demand gold and the

00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:24.623
bank then could go to the
Federal Reserve and get gold for

00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:27.299
it.
That was the system.

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:32.240
The gold standard was a success
in the sense that the price of

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.101
gold stayed constant because
that's what the whole system was

00:26:37.101 --> 00:26:40.741
designed to do.
There's a famous story about

00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:43.819
Irving Fisher,
who was a professor here at

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:48.098
Yale, who--remarking on how few
people understand the gold

00:26:48.098 --> 00:26:51.092
standard.
I don't know if I'm repeating

00:26:51.092 --> 00:26:54.910
this, but he was at his
dentist--I didn't tell you this.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:59.105
He was at his dentist and they
used to give gold fillings in

00:26:59.105 --> 00:27:01.616
those days.
He said to the dentist,

00:27:01.616 --> 00:27:05.204
just out of curiosity,
can you tell me what the price

00:27:05.204 --> 00:27:08.240
of gold has--what it's been
doing lately?

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.965
The dentist said,
gee I don't know,

00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:14.351
I'll look at my records.
I have some old records and

00:27:14.351 --> 00:27:17.293
I'll see what I'm paying for my
gold for the gold fillings ten

00:27:17.293 --> 00:27:20.350
years ago.
The dentist came back and said,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.640
funny thing;
it hasn't changed at all;

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.630
I'm paying exactly what I did
ten years ago.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.850
Irving Fisher then told that
story as an illustration of how

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.569
poorly the understanding was of
what was going on.

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:37.130
Of course the price of gold
never changed in the gold

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.690
standard because that was the
whole point of the gold

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.730
standard--that's if currency was
convertible into gold.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:50.356
What happened in the 1930s was
that one country after another

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:55.146
abandoned the gold standard.
The United Kingdom was the

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:58.947
prominent first case,
even though they had invented

00:27:58.947 --> 00:28:02.519
the gold standard hundreds of
years earlier.

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:06.036
In 1931, they dropped
convertibility of the pound

00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:10.211
sterling--still called pound
sterling even though it's not

00:28:10.211 --> 00:28:14.077
silver, it was gold.
They dropped the pound

00:28:14.077 --> 00:28:19.591
convertibility.
The United States dropped it in

00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:24.599
1933 and other countries did it
later.

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:29.176
The reason that countries
dropped the gold standard was

00:28:29.176 --> 00:28:34.177
that, under the effort to keep
the currency convertible into

00:28:34.177 --> 00:28:36.478
gold,
they were worsening the

00:28:36.478 --> 00:28:40.296
depression of the 1930s.
In order to keep the currency

00:28:40.296 --> 00:28:44.663
convertible, they had to keep
interest rates high to prevent

00:28:44.663 --> 00:28:49.761
people from demanding the gold.
Keeping interest rates high was

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:54.254
destroying the economy.
So, the gold standard ended in

00:28:54.254 --> 00:28:57.579
the 1930s and every country
dropped it.

00:28:57.579 --> 00:29:01.670
We're left with the central
banking institutions that are

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.250
now functioning without
convertibility to gold.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:11.164
Then you start to wonder,
well what is the system and

00:29:11.164 --> 00:29:15.955
what is it supposed to do?
The old gold standard was

00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:19.101
supposed to maintain the
convertibility of gold in

00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:22.632
currency but now we're not even
backing it with currency

00:29:22.632 --> 00:29:26.099
anymore--with gold anymore--so
what does it mean?

00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:32.336
Well, what it means is that
starting in the 1930s,

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:39.335
we began to think of central
banks as managing the money

00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:45.847
stock to stabilize the economy.
That's what--that's the view

00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:49.670
that's developed--that has been
with us ever since.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:55.757
They still hold gold and right
now the Federal Reserve System

00:29:55.757 --> 00:30:00.120
has about eleven billion dollars
of gold.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.051
They still have it.
Remember what happened in 1933

00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:09.160
is they abandoned convertibility
with gold.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.123
That means that you no longer
have the right to get it,

00:30:14.123 --> 00:30:18.720
but that doesn't mean they
don't still own gold;

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.440
it's just sitting there in
their vaults from way back.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.390
Some people ask,
what is the currency backed by?

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.218
It used to be backed by gold.
The question is--what it means

00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:37.069
to say something is backed by
something because,

00:30:37.069 --> 00:30:41.281
well you could say it's backed
by gold because the Fed has

00:30:41.281 --> 00:30:45.504
eleven billion dollars of gold.
That's a lot less then the

00:30:45.504 --> 00:30:49.349
amount of money out there,
but they always had fractional

00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:52.941
reserve of banking anyway.
They never kept all the gold

00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:56.257
for all the dollars that they
issued, so you could say it's

00:30:56.257 --> 00:30:59.333
still backed by gold.
The really important thing is,

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:03.336
it's not convertible into gold.
So, since 1933,

00:31:03.336 --> 00:31:08.730
the Fed has been managing
inflation.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.543
It used to be that there was
zero inflation,

00:31:11.543 --> 00:31:14.160
if you define it with respect
to gold,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.013
and they were really true to
that--zero inflation in terms of

00:31:19.013 --> 00:31:21.666
gold.
Now, there was inflation with

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:25.839
regard to a basket of--the
Consumer Price Index is not just

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:30.163
the price of gold;
it's the price of many things,

00:31:30.163 --> 00:31:35.041
but the--there would be
inflation or deflation as the

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:40.900
relative price of gold changed.
After 1933, we had lost our

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.097
moorings;
there was no longer any idea

00:31:44.097 --> 00:31:47.250
that the dollar was backed by
anything.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.849
The concept changed
fundamentally.

00:31:49.849 --> 00:31:56.946
The concept that became the
Federal Reserve or the central

00:31:56.946 --> 00:32:04.914
banks in any country is managing
the economy and their management

00:32:04.914 --> 00:32:13.380
of the money supply is their way
of managing how well things go.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:20.210
Generally, it has been
inflationary after 1933;

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.765
central banks have generally,
gradually allowed prices to

00:32:25.765 --> 00:32:28.491
rise.
The general view is that if

00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:32.930
it's not extreme--the rise is
not too extreme--it's good for

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.369
the health of the economy as
long as we don't have inflation

00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:42.592
that's too high.
So, central banks around the

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:50.006
world began to manage--became
managers of inflation rather

00:32:50.006 --> 00:32:54.819
then defenders of a gold
standard.

00:32:54.819 --> 00:32:57.619
Let me just mention a couple of
other central banks.

00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:01.190
The Bank of England has been
providing an example for the

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:05.867
world for a long time.
The Bank of Japan was

00:33:05.867 --> 00:33:14.410
established in imitation of the
Bank of England in 1882.

00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:24.398
Many central banks in Europe,
they have dates that go back to

00:33:24.398 --> 00:33:27.029
the eighteenth or nineteenth
century.

00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:30.470
Some banks, however,
are very new;

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:36.894
the European Central Bank,
which issues the Euro currency,

00:33:36.894 --> 00:33:42.529
was founded in 1998,
so it's only ten years old.

00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:47.263
That's because it replaced
central banks of the member

00:33:47.263 --> 00:33:52.325
countries of the European Union.
The central banks still exist,

00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:56.579
so you still have the Bank of
France, the Deutsche Bundesbank,

00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:00.824
etc., but they no longer have
the importance that they once

00:34:00.824 --> 00:34:04.410
did because they no longer
manage the currency.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.670
The currency is centralized at
the European Central Bank.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:14.001
One thing that's been a trend
around the world is that the--I

00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:18.144
mentioned that the U.S.
Federal Reserve System was

00:34:18.144 --> 00:34:21.615
different from other central
banks in that it was designed to

00:34:21.615 --> 00:34:24.875
have independence.
The thought was that the

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:29.988
central bank is guarding the
money stock and governments have

00:34:29.988 --> 00:34:35.102
a tendency to sometimes want to
raid the bank when they're in

00:34:35.102 --> 00:34:38.104
trouble.
Typically it happened during

00:34:38.104 --> 00:34:40.699
wars.
The government gets into a war.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:45.370
During the war,
the government needs resources;

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.430
it's in trouble;
it raises taxes to try to pay

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.890
for the war, but then it finds
it unable to collect taxes well.

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.130
People start evading taxes;
there's a lot of discord.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.739
It's just hard to raise money
by taxing.

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:03.130
What the government would do is
send someone over to the central

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:06.196
bank and say,
hey expand--give us–-just

00:35:06.196 --> 00:35:08.846
lend us the money.
You're the central bank,

00:35:08.846 --> 00:35:11.089
lend us the money.
So, the central bank would

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:13.757
print up notes and give it to
the government and the

00:35:13.757 --> 00:35:16.320
government would start spending
it on the war.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.250
Then you'd have inflation
because they're printing all

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.053
this money.
So, war time periods were

00:35:24.053 --> 00:35:27.685
typically periods of great
inflation and debasement of the

00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:31.287
currency.
That's why we need independence

00:35:31.287 --> 00:35:34.780
of the central bank;
we want to have a central

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.420
banker that can say no to the
government.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.085
The government comes to the
bank and says,

00:35:40.085 --> 00:35:44.626
it's a war we need the money.
The central bank would ideally

00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:46.623
say no.
How can you get a central

00:35:46.623 --> 00:35:49.243
banker to do that?
Well, they definitely have to

00:35:49.243 --> 00:35:52.580
be independent of the government
and that was the idea in the

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.514
U.S.
There's been a trend to making

00:35:55.514 --> 00:36:00.688
central banks more independent
and there are particular things

00:36:00.688 --> 00:36:03.907
that happened.
In Japan, in 1997,

00:36:03.907 --> 00:36:09.930
the government of Japan granted
the Bank of Japan independence

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.590
like the U.S.
central bank.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.530
It also happened in the U.K.
in the same year.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.156
Now, I've been describing the
Bank of England as the model for

00:36:24.156 --> 00:36:27.872
everyone, but in fact,
the Bank of England was not

00:36:27.872 --> 00:36:32.278
independent until 1997.
These people are--the people

00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:36.827
who run these banks--they may
still be appointed by the

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:42.050
government, but they have terms
of office that are lengthy.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.550
The government can't kick the
central head--head of the

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:51.716
central bank out for failing to
offer them loans when they want

00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:53.814
it.
In the United States,

00:36:53.814 --> 00:36:57.997
we have twelve Federal Reserve
Banks, but we have a Federal

00:36:57.997 --> 00:37:02.062
Open Market Committee.
The Federal Reserve Board in

00:37:02.062 --> 00:37:07.153
Washington organizes policy for
all twelve banks and the members

00:37:07.153 --> 00:37:11.760
of the Federal Reserve Board
have fourteen-year terms.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.245
Plus, all of the presidents of
the Federal Reserve Banks come

00:37:16.245 --> 00:37:20.133
and serve on something called
the Federal Open Market

00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:23.054
Committee.
The Federal Open Market

00:37:23.054 --> 00:37:28.106
Committee makes monetary policy,
so it's decentralized and long

00:37:28.106 --> 00:37:30.206
terms.
The board members have

00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:33.250
fourteen-year terms,
which is quite a long time.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:45.764
And the central--and also there
are the banks from the regional

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:52.545
banks that have a roll.
The Federal Open Market

00:37:52.545 --> 00:37:57.146
Committee meets about every six
weeks or so and they decide on

00:37:57.146 --> 00:38:01.382
monetary policy.
In fact, they decide on how to

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:07.360
set interest rates and borrowing
requirements for member banks.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.154
One of the things that the
Federal Reserve does is it sets

00:38:12.154 --> 00:38:17.183
reserve requirements for banks.
Reserve requirements are like

00:38:17.183 --> 00:38:22.079
what the Bank of England did or
the Suffolk Bank did long ago.

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:26.727
It says that you have to keep
deposits with us here at the

00:38:26.727 --> 00:38:31.579
central bank;
either that or else keep vault

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:39.079
cash and show that you have it
as reserves for your deposits.

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:42.170
Now, these banks no longer
issue notes.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.371
We've centralized the note
issue in the United States

00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:48.449
starting in 1913 with the
Federal Reserve Board,

00:38:48.449 --> 00:38:51.849
so your notes that you see are
called Federal Reserve Notes.

00:38:51.849 --> 00:38:57.214
Banks still are vulnerable to
bank runs because they still

00:38:57.214 --> 00:39:00.601
have deposits,
so the system is still

00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:05.191
vulnerable and,
therefore, the Federal Reserve

00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:08.460
has a set of reserve
requirements.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.210
Now the reserve requirement is
progressive.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.639
Small banks have lower reserve
requirements but it rapidly gets

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:20.174
up to a standard.
The reserve requirement now is

00:39:20.174 --> 00:39:26.446
10% on demand deposits,
so they're forced to keep those

00:39:26.446 --> 00:39:33.183
reserves and much of that is in
the form of deposits at the

00:39:33.183 --> 00:39:38.444
Federal Reserve Banks.
One form of monetary policy

00:39:38.444 --> 00:39:42.300
that the Fed does is they can
change these reserve

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.612
requirements.
The other, but more commonly

00:39:46.612 --> 00:39:51.953
used, monetary policy is to
change the rate--is to

00:39:51.953 --> 00:39:57.840
effectively alter the rate of
interest on deposits.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.127
So, the interest rate--the
policy tool in the United--the

00:40:03.127 --> 00:40:08.980
policy interest rate or key rate
in the United States is called

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.405
the Federal Funds Rate.
The Federal Funds Rate is an

00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:15.949
overnight lending rate between
banks.

00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:21.993
The Federal Reserve conducts
monetary policy by targeting the

00:40:21.993 --> 00:40:27.030
Federal Funds Rate and it
announces--since 1994,

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:31.550
it has been announcing after
the meetings of the Federal Open

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.693
Market Committee--it's been
announcing the Federal Funds

00:40:35.693 --> 00:40:39.595
Rate publicly.
The Federal Funds Rate was

00:40:39.595 --> 00:40:45.078
recently cut to 2.25% and it's
expected to be cut further

00:40:45.078 --> 00:40:50.659
because of the recession that
we're now apparently in.

00:40:50.659 --> 00:40:58.260
So, that will be the monetary
policy tool.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.105
What's happening right now in
the United States is that the

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:05.619
economy is collapsing--maybe
that's overstating it.

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:09.934
It's contracting,
so the Fed is trying to prevent

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:14.250
a serious recession by cutting
interest rates;

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.440
they've been cutting them
rapidly.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:22.105
The Federal Funds Rate is a
rate that is targeted by the Fed

00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:27.781
and it's their principle target.
The Federal Funds Rate is the

00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:32.519
rate that banks borrow and lend
to each other overnight.

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:36.550
There's another interest rate
that the Fed sets and that's

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:44.519
called the discount rate.
The discount rate is the rate

00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:54.550
that the Fed charges for loans
to member banks.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:58.615
The member banks,
just as with the Bank of

00:41:58.615 --> 00:42:04.169
England--when they're in
trouble, they are supposed to be

00:42:04.169 --> 00:42:08.829
able to borrow money from the
central bank.

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:13.711
The central bank posts an
interest rate that is the rate

00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:17.349
at which these member banks can
borrow.

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:26.152
There was an important change
in the discount rate in January

00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:30.566
of 2003.
It used to be that the Fed

00:42:30.566 --> 00:42:36.913
would grant loans to member
banks in the form of discount

00:42:36.913 --> 00:42:44.280
rate lending if the bank could
certify that it was in trouble.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:52.219
At that time they would give
generous--this was before 2003.

00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:57.049
The discount rate was a policy
variable set by the Fed and it

00:42:57.049 --> 00:43:02.199
was typically fifty basis points
below the Federal Funds Rate.

00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:06.455
They were lending to banks that
were in trouble and the--so,

00:43:06.455 --> 00:43:10.010
we'll give them a good rate;
that's what they used to do.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:17.812
In 2003, they decided to change
that and they decided to raise

00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:24.079
the discount rate above the
Federal Funds Rate.

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:26.220
Actually, there are two
discount rates;

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.403
there's primary and secondary.
The primary discount rate is

00:43:30.403 --> 00:43:34.750
typically a hundred basis points
above the Funds Rate.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:40.978
That's not so recently;
they've been cutting it

00:43:40.978 --> 00:43:43.059
relative--but that was
originally the idea.

00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:47.505
What they wanted to do starting
in 2003, was to eliminate the

00:43:47.505 --> 00:43:51.580
idea that the discount rate is
only for banks who are in

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.098
trouble.
They wanted to eliminate the

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:57.005
stigma--it used to be
embarrassing to borrow at the

00:43:57.005 --> 00:43:59.926
discount window,
because the discount rate

00:43:59.926 --> 00:44:04.140
would--because it would be an
admission that the bank is in

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.456
trouble.
So, in order to try to

00:44:06.456 --> 00:44:10.039
eliminate that stigma,
they made it a penalty rate.

00:44:10.039 --> 00:44:14.333
They made the discount rate
higher than the Federal Funds

00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:17.074
Rate;
so now, the Federal Funds Rate

00:44:17.074 --> 00:44:19.835
is at 2.25%.
The discount rate is now only

00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:23.719
twenty-five basis points higher;
it's at 2.5%.

00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:27.374
They've been cutting the spread
between the discount rate and

00:44:27.374 --> 00:44:31.029
the Federal Funds Rate--again
it's an effort to stimulate the

00:44:31.029 --> 00:44:34.342
economy.
I think one reason why they may

00:44:34.342 --> 00:44:39.174
have changed it in 2003 is that
interest rates were getting

00:44:39.174 --> 00:44:43.702
really close to zero in 2003.
They were worried that if the

00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:47.426
discount rate is fifty basis
points below the Federal Funds

00:44:47.426 --> 00:44:49.511
Rate,
then it's going to hit zero and

00:44:49.511 --> 00:44:51.949
that would be embarrassing;
so they moved it.

00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:54.376
I think that might be the
reason--no one knows what all

00:44:54.376 --> 00:44:55.320
their reasons were.

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:04.917
The basic idea that's developed
is that the Fed is looking at

00:45:04.917 --> 00:45:08.306
inflation and unemployment as
the two major things that it

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:11.401
looks at.
Inflation is the most important

00:45:11.401 --> 00:45:15.371
thing, according to many views,
because the Fed has to

00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:20.015
guarantee the soundness of the
money supply and there have been

00:45:20.015 --> 00:45:23.985
so many cases in history when
the central bank allowed

00:45:23.985 --> 00:45:27.880
debasement of the currency
through inflation.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.946
It's thought that that is a
serious error because it

00:45:30.946 --> 00:45:34.246
destroys trust in the currency.
On the other hand,

00:45:34.246 --> 00:45:38.782
the Fed is also concerned with
unemployment and the possibility

00:45:38.782 --> 00:45:42.980
of a collapse in the system.
Right now, the Fed is in a

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.842
difficult situation.
Last year, we had 4%

00:45:46.842 --> 00:45:53.520
inflation--4% inflation is high
by traditional standards.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.367
It's above what we'd like;
we'd like it to be more like

00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:59.136
2%--4% is high.
So, that would mean that the

00:45:59.136 --> 00:46:02.944
Fed should be raising interest
rates to try to tighten up the

00:46:02.944 --> 00:46:05.800
economy and bring the inflation
rate down.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.647
Unfortunately,
we're in this collapse

00:46:08.647 --> 00:46:12.840
situation in the economy,
so the Fed has a problem.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.820
There's a name for this--it's
called stagflation.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.437
Stagflation was a term that was
developed in the 1970s to refer

00:46:20.437 --> 00:46:24.831
to a time when inflation is--we
have both high inflation and

00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:28.657
high unemployment;
and so we're in that situation

00:46:28.657 --> 00:46:32.686
apparently again.
With interest rates hitting

00:46:32.686 --> 00:46:39.024
zero--I say Alan Greenspan--Ben
Bernanke must be losing sleep at

00:46:39.024 --> 00:46:41.586
night.
This is exactly the worst

00:46:41.586 --> 00:46:45.736
nightmare of a central banker.
You've got this policy tool of

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:48.742
interest rates,
but once it hits zero you're

00:46:48.742 --> 00:46:52.256
out of business.
So, he has been working on

00:46:52.256 --> 00:46:56.210
trying to find other tools of
monetary policy.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.821
Ben Bernanke has been very
creative in doing--maybe I ought

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:07.840
to write some of these things
down.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:17.632
The Term Auction Facility--or
TAF--was created by the Federal

00:47:17.632 --> 00:47:25.140
Reserve under Bernanke,
on December 12^(th).

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:33.743
It's a new form of monetary
policy--a new invention,

00:47:33.743 --> 00:47:38.809
which we've been doing only for
a matter of months now.

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:43.570
What the term auction
facility--it was also created in

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.612
connection--in
collaboration--with the Bank of

00:47:47.612 --> 00:47:50.060
Canada,
the Bank of England,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.150
the European Central Bank,
and the Swiss National Bank.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:57.136
So, we're seeing an
internationalization of bank

00:47:57.136 --> 00:48:00.148
monetary policy.
All of these central banks--of

00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:02.889
Canada, England,
Europe, and Switzerland--got

00:48:02.889 --> 00:48:06.440
together with the Federal
Reserve and said--obviously they

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.240
were worried about the financial
crisis that was engulfing the

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.685
world.
So, they agreed to auction

00:48:13.685 --> 00:48:20.071
off--it's a little bit different
than a--it's a little different

00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:23.719
from an ordinary monetary
policy.

00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:28.869
It's a way of helping troubled
financial institutions.

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:32.139
What they did instead of
just--remember,

00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:36.834
the Federal Funds Rate is a
target interest rate that the

00:48:36.834 --> 00:48:41.361
Fed attempts to hit through
buying and selling treasury

00:48:41.361 --> 00:48:44.785
bills in the U.S.
or in other countries buying

00:48:44.785 --> 00:48:47.510
and selling government bonds to
affect the market.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.674
If the Fed wants to push the
Federal Funds Rate

00:48:50.674 --> 00:48:54.940
up–down--it goes and buys
short-term government bonds.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.280
Buying them tends to push up
the price;

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.295
that tends to influence the
yield down, so it encourages a

00:49:01.295 --> 00:49:06.208
lower level of interest rate.
The term auction facility is

00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:09.373
different.
In this facility,

00:49:09.373 --> 00:49:16.516
banks are allowed to--the Fed
announces a certain amount of

00:49:16.516 --> 00:49:22.674
money that it wants to put out
there in the form of

00:49:22.674 --> 00:49:30.309
collateralized loans with other
banks--with member banks.

00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:37.248
What the Fed said it would do
is announce an auction of so

00:49:37.248 --> 00:49:44.917
many billion dollars of loans to
member banks and the banks have

00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:50.760
to supply collateral to the
Federal Reserve.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.509
The collateral could be a
number of things,

00:49:54.509 --> 00:49:57.277
including
mortgages--securitized

00:49:57.277 --> 00:50:01.829
mortgages--that are risky and
dangerous assets.

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:07.407
In effect, the Fed is trying to
solve the subprime crisis by

00:50:07.407 --> 00:50:15.442
taking on, as collateral,
some of these risky things in

00:50:15.442 --> 00:50:23.949
exchange for offering loans to
member banks.

00:50:23.949 --> 00:50:27.829
It's different from Fed policy
in that they set up a certain

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:31.840
amount of money and auction that
off to the highest bidder.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.602
Troubled banks then,
who have this--the problem

00:50:35.602 --> 00:50:40.427
banks have now is they have
these securitized mortgages that

00:50:40.427 --> 00:50:44.844
they've bought and the
homeowners are defaulting on the

00:50:44.844 --> 00:50:48.514
mortgages now.
So, there's a panic in the

00:50:48.514 --> 00:50:53.444
market for securitized mortgages
and the price is often very low

00:50:53.444 --> 00:50:58.139
or if it's--they're very hard to
market and hard to sell.

00:50:58.139 --> 00:51:01.272
Banks are in trouble and,
as you know,

00:51:01.272 --> 00:51:06.014
they're starting to fail
because they--the value of their

00:51:06.014 --> 00:51:09.739
assets in the market is falling
rapidly.

00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:13.704
The Fed is effectively just
saying, we'll take those assets

00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:19.077
as collateral for loans to you.
So, they've given,

00:51:19.077 --> 00:51:26.351
as of today,
it's eighty billion dollars on

00:51:26.351 --> 00:51:31.014
the term.
This thing--this new invention

00:51:31.014 --> 00:51:34.030
is three months old at this
point.

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:40.309
The system continues to look
more precarious.

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:48.228
This is a very interesting time
because the Fed is continuing to

00:51:48.228 --> 00:51:55.073
invent.
Then they came up with the Term

00:51:55.073 --> 00:52:00.050
Securities Loan Facility."

00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:12.077
Don't look this up in Fabozzi
because the date of founding was

00:52:12.077 --> 00:52:15.356
March 11,2008;
that's the date that they

00:52:15.356 --> 00:52:19.296
announced it.
What they're going to do is

00:52:19.296 --> 00:52:26.217
have auctions of loans of
treasury securities in exchange

00:52:26.217 --> 00:52:30.542
for collateral,
such as the mortgage

00:52:30.542 --> 00:52:38.476
securities.
The first auction is March

00:52:38.476 --> 00:52:47.869
27,2008, which you may note is
tomorrow.

00:52:47.869 --> 00:52:53.898
Actually, I mentioned the Term
Securities Loan Facility because

00:52:53.898 --> 00:52:58.760
it's a new innovation but it
hasn't started yet.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:05.686
In their announcement on March
11^(th), they said the Fed would

00:53:05.686 --> 00:53:11.719
lend up to $200 billion of
securities to the market.

00:53:11.719 --> 00:53:15.766
What they're really doing is
just--we're facing this seize up

00:53:15.766 --> 00:53:19.905
of our financial system,
so we have banks that--we've

00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:24.761
just seen the failure of Bear
Stearns, which is actually a

00:53:24.761 --> 00:53:27.665
broker-dealer.
But banks and broker-dealers

00:53:27.665 --> 00:53:30.524
are in trouble because their
assets are collapsing under

00:53:30.524 --> 00:53:32.701
them.
They can't sell them to get

00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:36.486
money, so the Fed is saying,
fine we'll just take those and

00:53:36.486 --> 00:53:40.649
we'll give you Treasury bills,
which are completely--everyone

00:53:40.649 --> 00:53:43.226
trusts them.
So, you have some asset that

00:53:43.226 --> 00:53:44.690
nobody trusts,
the U.S.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:49.694
Federal Reserve will take it on.
This is an effort--this is

00:53:49.694 --> 00:53:53.969
different from most monetary
policy.

00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:58.898
Now, it's different in
important ways because it's

00:53:58.898 --> 00:54:05.235
really focused at preventing the
collapse of the economy that is

00:54:05.235 --> 00:54:09.460
created by a financial system
failure.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:14.747
It's looking at the problem
that certain troubled

00:54:14.747 --> 00:54:21.247
institutions have--that their
assets can't be sold--and it's

00:54:21.247 --> 00:54:24.330
just saying,
okay we'll replace them with

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:28.336
assets that can be sold.
The Fed is taking on a serious

00:54:28.336 --> 00:54:33.801
risk in doing this because these
assets that it takes on in

00:54:33.801 --> 00:54:38.230
exchange for Treasury securities
could fail.

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:45.008
Nobody knows how bad the
mortgage crisis is going to get,

00:54:45.008 --> 00:54:51.424
but Ben Bernanke thinks that
it's so important that we

00:54:51.424 --> 00:54:57.840
prevent a collapse that we
should take that risk.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.649
Incidentally,
both of these things--this is

00:55:01.649 --> 00:55:07.183
called a TSF and this is called
a TAF--both of these are joint

00:55:07.183 --> 00:55:10.630
with the Fed in the United
States,

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:16.765
the ECB, the Bank of England,
and the Swiss Bank,

00:55:16.765 --> 00:55:22.213
and Bank of Canada.
These are all international

00:55:22.213 --> 00:55:26.409
efforts to forestall a financial
crisis.

00:55:26.409 --> 00:55:33.159
There's a third one,
which is even newer.

00:55:33.159 --> 00:55:45.636
It made--this one was
announced--the third innovation

00:55:45.636 --> 00:55:59.072
is called the Primary Dealer
Credit Facility and that was

00:55:59.072 --> 00:56:07.690
announced March 16,2008.
So, that's how many days ago?

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:15.019
A few days ago--ten days
ago--and that's called the PDCF.

00:56:15.019 --> 00:56:20.941
What the PDCF is,
it's really an extension of the

00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:25.630
discount window beyond member
banks.

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:30.219
You have to know what are
primary dealers.

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:35.880
Primary dealers are
broker-dealers;

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.754
they are not banks.
The critical thing that's

00:56:40.754 --> 00:56:44.824
happening is that at a time of
financial crisis,

00:56:44.824 --> 00:56:49.674
which exceeds any that we've
seen perhaps since The Great

00:56:49.674 --> 00:56:54.099
Depression,
but certainly bigger than we've

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:58.805
seen in many years,
the Fed is worrying about not

00:56:58.805 --> 00:57:04.590
just member banks but also other
financial institutions.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:07.284
For example,
Bear Stearns,

00:57:07.284 --> 00:57:11.920
which is a broker-dealer failed
recently.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.849
The Fed is worried about a
collapsing house of cards.

00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:20.855
What's essential about the
Primary Dealer Credit Facility

00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:24.860
is that they're opening up the
discount window of lending

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.150
beyond the member bank to
primary dealers.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:33.592
What is a primary dealer?
When the Treasury in the United

00:57:33.592 --> 00:57:39.190
States sells Treasury bills,
notes, and bonds,

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:43.753
they deal almost
exclusively--or we say

00:57:43.753 --> 00:57:50.599
primarily--with broker-dealers,
not the general public.

00:57:50.599 --> 00:57:55.893
The Federal Reserve has a list,
which you can find on their

00:57:55.893 --> 00:58:00.730
website, of dealers who are
eligible to participate in

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:05.278
Treasury security auctions.
There are twenty--actually,

00:58:05.278 --> 00:58:07.760
I'm not sure there are twenty
anymore.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.864
One of them was Bear Stearns,
so I don't know whether they're

00:58:10.864 --> 00:58:13.710
still on the list--maybe they
are, maybe they're not;

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.619
we might be down to nineteen.
These are broker-dealers--some

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:21.260
of them are international,
like BNP Paribas is one of

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.529
them--it's French.
By opening up the Primary

00:58:25.529 --> 00:58:31.463
Dealer Credit Facility,
we are--what the government is

00:58:31.463 --> 00:58:38.293
offering to do is to take bad
investments that they made on as

00:58:38.293 --> 00:58:45.190
collateral for loans at 2.5%,
which is the current discount

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:47.824
rate.
This is quite a remarkable

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.660
change, reflecting the
seriousness of the crisis.

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:08.879
I think it's reflecting the
fact that we're moving into

00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:13.181
possibly a situation
of--protracted situation--of

00:59:13.181 --> 00:59:19.459
nearly zero interest rates.
In an effort to get more--to

00:59:19.459 --> 00:59:26.957
keep the economy from collapsing
at a time when--at a time of

00:59:26.957 --> 00:59:33.080
great concern about the
structure of the financial

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.106
system.
This is different than other

00:59:36.106 --> 00:59:38.950
recessions.
We've had other economic

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:44.152
problems that have led to
recessions, but it hasn't seemed

00:59:44.152 --> 00:59:49.079
to be something as potentially
global as it is now.

00:59:49.079 --> 00:59:54.050
We had the Savings and Loan
crisis of the 1980s.

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:57.272
In the Savings and Loan crisis,
it was a certain segment of the

00:59:57.272 --> 01:00:00.026
banking community--the
S&amp;L's--that seemed to be in

01:00:00.026 --> 01:00:03.011
trouble,
but it didn't seem to be then a

01:00:03.011 --> 01:00:07.659
house of cards that could spread
around the country and around

01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:11.802
the world.
In 1998, there was the Russian

01:00:11.802 --> 01:00:18.212
default crisis and then there
was some seize up of--that maybe

01:00:18.212 --> 01:00:24.771
resembles what is happening now.
Long-term Capital Management

01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:31.048
was a big hedge fund that failed
in 1998 and got bailed out by

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:34.597
the Fed.
I didn't see then the

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:40.468
proliferations of these new
instruments that reflect

01:00:40.468 --> 01:00:46.110
concerns about the current
economic situation.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:53.744
I think maybe the concluding
lesson--the central banks were

01:00:53.744 --> 01:01:01.510
institutions that emerged out of
experience with bankers.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:05.537
It started not really as a
planned system--not planned by

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:09.327
any government.
The Bank of England was its own

01:01:09.327 --> 01:01:12.806
bank and the Suffolk Bank was
its own bank,

01:01:12.806 --> 01:01:16.783
and they developed ways of
doing business without

01:01:16.783 --> 01:01:21.670
government planning to help try
to preserve stability of the

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:24.874
system.
There have been fundamental

01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:29.265
changes through time that make
the role of the central bank

01:01:29.265 --> 01:01:33.440
evolve and change through time.
I mentioned earlier that we

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.877
used to be on the gold standard
and central banks were gold

01:01:36.877 --> 01:01:40.552
standard institutions that were
trying to stabilize the economy

01:01:40.552 --> 01:01:43.753
but subject to the constraint
that they had to maintain

01:01:43.753 --> 01:01:49.631
convertibility with gold,
but those central banks' role

01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:54.860
has changed a lot.
It seems like the nature of

01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:01.930
recessions is always changing.
The biggest recession we've had

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:09.657
since The Great Depression was
actually a pair of recessions

01:02:09.657 --> 01:02:15.289
in--there was a short recession
in 1980.

01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:19.161
It lasted just a few months and
people--once we got out of it

01:02:19.161 --> 01:02:22.065
people thought,
maybe we're getting a brief--a

01:02:22.065 --> 01:02:24.039
respite.
But then the U.S.

01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:29.010
crashed into a huge,
well actually,

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:35.150
it was as worldwide recession
of 1981-2.

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:39.850
This was the biggest recession
since The Great Depression.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:44.033
What caused that recession?
I think there's a simple story,

01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:46.739
which is very different from
what's causing the

01:02:46.739 --> 01:02:49.210
current--apparently
current--recession.

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:54.442
In the 1960s and 70s,
central banks around the world

01:02:54.442 --> 01:02:59.569
were inflating the currency.
It was getting out of

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:02.729
proportion.
We had inflation rates in the

01:03:02.729 --> 01:03:06.572
United Kingdom on the order of
20% a year and people were

01:03:06.572 --> 01:03:09.179
asking, what is going on in the
UK?

01:03:09.179 --> 01:03:11.679
Bastion of enlightenment,
what's going on?

01:03:11.679 --> 01:03:16.508
They elected Margaret Thatcher
and there was a resolve to do

01:03:16.508 --> 01:03:20.600
something about it,
but it wasn't just the U.K.;

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.525
it was all over the world.
Inflation rates had gotten very

01:03:23.525 --> 01:03:26.890
high, even in Germany,
where anti-inflation sentiment

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:29.393
was the highest.
Central banks,

01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:33.122
around this time,
I think it was under the

01:03:33.122 --> 01:03:37.938
leadership of Paul Volker,
who was the Federal Reserve

01:03:37.938 --> 01:03:42.941
Chairman, they raised interest
rates to kill inflation and they

01:03:42.941 --> 01:03:46.250
threw the world into a huge
recession.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:51.572
What caused it?
It was caused--maybe it's

01:03:51.572 --> 01:03:55.637
oversimplifying it--it was
caused by a change in our

01:03:55.637 --> 01:04:00.498
resolve to let's get inflation
under control and a willingness

01:04:00.498 --> 01:04:05.519
to accept the recession--to stop
the advance of inflation.

01:04:05.519 --> 01:04:08.891
You can blame it on other
things, like the oil crisis of

01:04:08.891 --> 01:04:11.159
1979--nothing is completely
simple.

01:04:11.159 --> 01:04:15.563
Anyway, this recession has been
a model for what happens in

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:18.660
recessions.
The idea that emerged--the

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.801
memory of the '81-82 recession
is very strong in our

01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:27.104
imagination because we think
that it was caused by lax

01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:30.090
monetary policy,
by liberal thinking,

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:33.804
by the soft-hearted liberals
who just didn't want to create

01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:36.945
any pain and suffering.
I'm talking about the view

01:04:36.945 --> 01:04:40.094
that's commonplace.
So, we finally got tough and we

01:04:40.094 --> 01:04:43.864
got Paul Volker in there and
central banks around the world

01:04:43.864 --> 01:04:47.375
all managed to get tough around
that time and we killed

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:51.159
inflation,
but it created a recession.

01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:54.862
That's what happened in '81-82,
but you have to remember that

01:04:54.862 --> 01:04:58.224
times are different.
Subsequent recessions were not

01:04:58.224 --> 01:05:02.879
like that.
We had another recession in

01:05:02.879 --> 01:05:08.539
1990-91 and it wasn't very big
or bad.

01:05:08.539 --> 01:05:11.698
This recession was,
I think, just a Gulf War

01:05:11.698 --> 01:05:13.718
recession.
It was caused by,

01:05:13.718 --> 01:05:16.598
well partly by,
an oil price spike caused by

01:05:16.598 --> 01:05:19.679
the Saddam--the war against
Saddam Hussein.

01:05:19.679 --> 01:05:23.679
It was also caused by just a
general lack of confidence.

01:05:23.679 --> 01:05:27.779
It wasn't caused by the Fed's
sudden tightening against

01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:30.140
inflation.
It was different,

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:35.260
it was--this recession was not
understood, not anticipated;

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.675
the Fed came in late to cut
interest rates to try to prevent

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:42.032
it from being worse because it
just didn't seem to have any

01:05:42.032 --> 01:05:45.040
reason for happening.
It just surprised everyone,

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.090
so it was not a repeat of this.
Then we saw the 2001 recession;

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:53.130
that recession again is
different.

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.830
I think the 2001--if you want
to have a story about it,

01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:00.873
the 2001 recession was caused
by the end of the stock market

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:03.642
boom.
We had a bubble in the stock

01:06:03.642 --> 01:06:07.792
market in the '90s and it
collapsed after 2000 and with

01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:10.559
that it brought the economy
down.

01:06:10.559 --> 01:06:15.636
The Fed then again cut interest
rates in 2001 in response to the

01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:18.860
very definite weakness of the
economy.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:24.969
Then that brings us to the 2008
recession.

01:06:24.969 --> 01:06:28.863
Now, it still hasn't been
identified as a recession and

01:06:28.863 --> 01:06:33.044
some people are still hoping
that we won't have a recession

01:06:33.044 --> 01:06:35.790
in 2008.
I think it's really looking

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:39.231
like we are in a recession.
Notably, there are different

01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:42.207
indicators.
The one that just came out is

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:46.881
the Consumer Confidence Index,
which was a Conference Board

01:06:46.881 --> 01:06:50.612
publication.
That index is now way below the

01:06:50.612 --> 01:06:54.030
lowest that it got in the 2001
recession.

01:06:54.030 --> 01:07:00.759
It's at the level--almost down
to the lowest that we got in the

01:07:00.759 --> 01:07:04.544
1990-91 recession.
So I--by that indicator,

01:07:04.544 --> 01:07:08.580
we are in a recession and we
don't know that it's over yet;

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:12.409
it's been falling.
Home prices are falling at the

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:16.271
highest rate we've ever seen.
I have my own index,

01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:19.218
the Standard &amp;
Poor's/Case-Shiller indexes,

01:07:19.218 --> 01:07:21.909
and we announced our indexes
yesterday.

01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:27.371
We saw record price declines on
a monthly basis for fourteen of

01:07:27.371 --> 01:07:30.630
our twenty cities that we
reported.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:36.352
That means that they've never
declined as much in one month

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:40.079
before;
our data started in 1987.

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:43.347
We don't have data on
individual city basis,

01:07:43.347 --> 01:07:47.224
but it really looks like the
housing collapse--price

01:07:47.224 --> 01:07:51.404
collapse--that we're going
through now is on a magnitude

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:56.039
not paralleled since The Great
Depression of the 1930s.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:01.515
I think that we are in a
difficult situation,

01:08:01.515 --> 01:08:06.119
but maybe let's not panic about
it.

01:08:06.119 --> 01:08:09.824
The optimistic thing is,
I think that we have a very

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:14.109
good Fed chairman and we have
coordinated efforts by central

01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:18.612
banks around the world and we're
doing things that are attempts

01:08:18.612 --> 01:08:22.970
to prevent the collapse of the
financial institutions.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:26.326
I think we're still in a
precarious situation,

01:08:26.326 --> 01:08:30.279
but I think we do have central
bankers who are working

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:33.859
effectively, given the tools
that they have.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.069
Now incidentally,
I'm writing a book,

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:39.260
the title of the book is
Subprime Solution;

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:46.699
I just sent off the draft to
the copy editor last Friday.

01:08:46.699 --> 01:08:52.891
The book--my publisher,
Princeton University Press,

01:08:52.891 --> 01:08:58.960
wants to get it out before this
crisis is over.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:05.115
We've got them on a rush to try
to get the book out and they're

01:09:05.115 --> 01:09:10.576
thinking that we'll at least
have copies to reviewers by

01:09:10.576 --> 01:09:13.748
June.
I've been worrying that my book

01:09:13.748 --> 01:09:17.497
will be too late and that by
June everything will be

01:09:17.497 --> 01:09:22.856
rosy--that it'll all be over.
I guess I should hope that that

01:09:22.856 --> 01:09:27.316
happens, but I have a suspicion
that come June,

01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:31.626
this crisis will not be over.
Unfortunately,

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:36.451
some of you are on the job
market this year and I want to

01:09:36.451 --> 01:09:41.880
give you some consolation if you
have not had a great success so

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.252
far in finding a finance job.
The consolation is,

01:09:46.252 --> 01:09:50.882
they're killing people at the
top too, so they're going to--so

01:09:50.882 --> 01:09:54.829
when you do get a job in a
financial institution,

01:09:54.829 --> 01:09:58.250
there will be more spaces above
you on the ladder to move up.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:04.086
I'm saying that kind of
jokingly, but I think you are

01:10:04.086 --> 01:10:09.810
facing a rather--if you're out
in the job market,

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:13.420
you are facing a difficult
economy, but I'm sure that you

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.000
will emerge all right in the
long run.

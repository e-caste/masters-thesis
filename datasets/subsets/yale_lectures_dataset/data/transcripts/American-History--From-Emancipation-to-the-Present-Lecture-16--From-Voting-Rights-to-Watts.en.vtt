00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.767
OK. Now, I know you've all done
the reading for the week

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.300
already and I know that you
remember everything I was

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.800
saying at the last
minute before break,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.400
but just for my sake, I'll
just remind you that we were

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.800
just wrapping up
talking about the March on

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Washington for
Jobs and Freedom,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.300
and the assassination of
the four little girls in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.367
Birmingham, Alabama,
essentially spending the

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.667
time, much of our
last week of lecture,

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.167
dealing, dealing with these
iconographic individuals and

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.800
moments in Martin
Luther King and the March on

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Washington, and trying to
unravel a lot of the more

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.867
familiar historiography
or history around these

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:45.100
individuals.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.000
What I want to do today is
to continue in that work of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.800
reframing the civil rights
movement iconic figures and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.500
spend today's lecture
talking about Malcolm X.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.900
Now a couple of caveats,
maybe just one caveat,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.800
to begin with is
that for this week's,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.467
this week's lectures are
going to be overlapping

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:11.100
themselves, so that we have
today talking about Malcolm

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.000
X from say, well his,
his biography essentially,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.067
till his
assassination in sixty-five,

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:21.000
and then on Wednesday, we're
going to go back over the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.967
time period between roughly
'63 and '65.&nbsp; It's the

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:30.400
simplest way that I know of
to make sure that we handle

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.600
a new understanding
of, of Malcolm X,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.200
or maybe a
different understanding,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.267
and also make sure we get
the events on the ground

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:39.000
that are happening at
the same time.&nbsp; So the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.200
chronology's
overlapping.&nbsp; Okay,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.900
with that
explanation out of the way,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.600
let me begin with a sampling
of Malcolm X's famous

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.100
rhetoric, and this one
is following the March on

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700
Washington.&nbsp; So we're
talking about now in August

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.800
of 1963.&nbsp; When asked about
the March on Washington,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.467
Malcolm X
replied or giving a,

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:06.300
giving a speech--this is an
excerpt from "Message to the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.000
Grassroots": "No,
it was a sellout.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.267
It was a takeover.

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:14.100
When James Baldwin
came in from Paris,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.200
they wouldn't let him talk,
because they couldn't make

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200
him go by the script.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.400
Burt Lancaster read the
speech that Baldwin was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000
supposed to make; they
wouldn't let Baldwin get up

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.967
there, because they know,
they know Baldwin's liable

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:26.900
to say anything.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.000
They controlled it so tight
---- they told those Negroes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.067
what time to hit
town, how to come,

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.700
where to stop,
what signs to carry,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.200
what song to sing, what
speech they could make,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.800
and what speech
they couldn't make;

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.600
and then told them to
get out town by sundown.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.767
And every one of those Toms
was out of town by sundown.

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.667
Now I know you don't
like say--my saying this,

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.500
but I can, I can back it up.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.767
It was a circus, a
performance that beat

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.767
anything
Hollywood could ever do,

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:55.700
the performance of the year.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.600
(Walter Reuther, labor
leader) Walter Reuther and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.400
those other three devils
should get a Academy Award

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.467
for the best actors because
they acted like they really

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:06.100
loved Negroes and fooled
a whole lot of Negroes.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.067
And the six Negro leaders
should get an award too,

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.067
for the best
supporting cast."

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.300
It's quite a statement.&nbsp;
This is again from "Message

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.000
to the Grassroots," although
he would respond to other

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800
people that the speech
was nothing but a circus on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.100
other occasions, it's
delivered shortly before

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.967
Malcolm X breaks with the
Nation of Islam and Elijah

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:37.300
Muhammad.&nbsp; The
reading for this week,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.667
one of the
readings,Malcolm X Speaks,

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.667
excerpts, a collection of,
of talks edited by George

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.400
Breitman, are all
ex--speeches from "Message

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.100
to the Grassroots" to the
end of Malcolm X's life,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.000
a, a time period that's
rather important for reasons

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.267
you'll see as the course of
the lecture--over the course

00:03:55.267 --> 00:04:01.267
of this lecture.&nbsp; Now
Malcolm X was famous for

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.100
rhetoric like referring to
the March on Washington as a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.700
circus and for other,
other sort of notorious,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.767
infamous statements.&nbsp; I want
to play a couple of other

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:19.200
excerpts, because there's
nothing like hearing the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.500
person speaking.&nbsp; The first
is from--and I'll let the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.300
two speeches run
together.&nbsp; You'll,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.200
you'll notice the break,
definitely.&nbsp; The first is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.300
from "The Ballot or the
Bullet" and the second is

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.300
from "The Black--The
Black Revolution."

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.700
[Malcolm X:] &nbsp;This is why I
say it's the ballot or the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.700
bullet.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.900
It's liberty or it's death.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.200
It's freedom for everybody
or freedom for nobody.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.567
America today finds herself
in a unique situation.

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.700
Historically,
revolutions are bloody.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.867
Oh, yes, they are.

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:57.600
They haven't ever had a
bloodless revolution,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.800
or a nonviolent revolution.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000
That don't happen
even in Hollywood.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.400
You don't have a revolution
in which you love your

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.300
enemy, and you don't have a
revolution in which you are

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.100
begging the system of
exploitation to integrate

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.700
you into it.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.300
Revolutions
overturn systems.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.900
Revolution destroys systems.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.300
A revolution is bloody,
but America is in a unique

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.167
position.&nbsp; She's the only
country in history in a

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:37.500
position actually to become
involved in a bloodless

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
revolution.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.500
All she's got to do is
give the black man in this

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.167
country
everything that's due him,

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:48.167
everything.

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:52.567
I hope that the
white man can see this,

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:56.867
because if you don't
see it you're finished.

00:05:56.867 --> 00:06:02.800
If you don't see it you're
going to become involved in

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.600
some action in which
you don't have a chance.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.500
And we don't care anything
about your atomic bomb;

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.800
it's useless because other
countries have atomic bombs.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.667
When two or three different
countries have atomic bombs,

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:27.567
nobody can use them, so it
means that the white man

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:30.267
today is without a weapon.

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:36.700
If you want some action, you
gotta come on down to Earth.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.567
And there's more black
people on Earth than there

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:46.400
are white people on Earth.&nbsp;
It'll be--it'll be the,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.200
the ballot or
it'll be the bullet.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.967
It'll be liberty
or it'll be death.

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:58.800
And if you're not
ready to pay that price,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.100
don't use the word
freedom in your vocabulary."

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.200
That's the end of the first
clip.&nbsp; And the second clip

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.867
begins right now.

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:11.000
[Malcolm X: ] "We
should defend ourselves.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.900
And when I say we should
defend ourselves against the

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.000
violence of others, that
if they use their press

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.500
skillfully to make the world
think that I'm calling on

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.567
violence period, and I
wouldn't call on anybody to

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:29.800
be violent without a cause.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.900
But I think the black
man in this country,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.500
above and beyond
people all over the world,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.467
will be more justified when
he stands up and starts to

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:47.000
protect himself, no matter
how many necks he has to

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.167
break or heads
he has to crack."

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:55.100
This is why I say it's
the ballot or the bullet.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.167
So it's important to ask,
when thinking about Malcolm

00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:00.167
X, and these--playing
these excerpts,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.700
are we hearing a different
kind of voice?&nbsp; Are we

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.900
hearing a different
engagement or interpretation

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.767
with the present moment,
1964?&nbsp; Are we hearing a

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:14.567
different agenda?&nbsp; Is
this what makes Malcolm X so

00:08:14.567 --> 00:08:17.400
different from Martin
Luther King and other famous

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.767
African American
leaders?&nbsp; Well,

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:24.400
you know by now that
what he's asking for in The

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.967
Ballot or the Bullet, the
excerpt from the speech The

00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:34.100
Ballot or the Bullet, he's
asking for civil rights.&nbsp; He

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.000
says there's no need
for a bloody revolution,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.800
certainly.&nbsp; All he's asking
is for that--for the black

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.300
man what is due him, he says
in the quote.&nbsp; Is he doing

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.000
something new when he's
asking for these things?&nbsp;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.700
You can go back to the
Niagara Movement in 1905 and

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.900
hear a lot of the same kinds
of things that Malcolm X is

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.500
seeking.&nbsp; Okay now the
Niagara Movement wasn't

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.400
calling for
violence upon violence,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.667
in, in response to
violence, self-defense,

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:09.200
not that way.&nbsp; So one
might say well he was doing

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.400
something new
there.&nbsp; But even then,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.700
no.&nbsp; If you look back to
Robert Williams in the

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.400
1950s, head of the NAACP
chapter in North Carolina,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.100
something I've already
brought up before and in

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.400
your reader, he was
calling for black men to,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.200
you know, gather up
their arms and respond with

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.300
force.&nbsp; So Malcolm X is
talking really in a longer

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.100
tradition, certainly a long
tradition of calling for

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.567
full civil
rights and equality,

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:40.900
and, and speaking in a
long tradition as well,

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.700
although much less
talked about and much less

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.400
consistent really,
but always there,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.600
about violent self-defense,
embracing violence,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.600
if, if this
is--embracing self-defense,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.300
and if that means
using violence,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.367
so be it.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:04.667
Now why is this lingering,
worth lingering over?&nbsp; It's

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:07.900
worth it because like
Martin Luther King,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.067
Malcolm X's life is frozen
in time.&nbsp; We'll be coming

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:17.000
back next to King next week
and you'll--I'll flesh out

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.700
that statement more
completely.&nbsp; But like Martin

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.800
Luther King, Malcolm X is
frozen in time.&nbsp; And really

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.867
frozen in time incorrectly.&nbsp;
Malcolm X's life is

00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:31.400
encapsulated by
just, you know,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.167
the phrase "By any means
necessary."&nbsp; Certainly,

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:40.200
gosh, I can't remember
how many years ago now,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.900
when Spike Lee's film
Malcolm X came out,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.600
there was just an
amazing moment at the

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.000
commodification
of Malcolm X,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.367
embodied in really cool
baseball caps with a white X

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:53.900
on the front, or in
t-shirt and such.&nbsp; And,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.400
you know, that's how
you "kept it real,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.667
 by walking around town
wearing that kind of outfit,

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.100
wearing Malcolm X,
and his belief system,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.067
allegedly with an
over--overpriced cap you're

00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:12.300
wearing or the t-shirt.&nbsp;
The fact is that the

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.000
popularized, commodified
image of Malcolm X is also

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
one that's out of date.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.900
In fact, by the
end of his life,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.400
he was not even
known as Malcolm X,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.000
and he distanced himself in
an incremental fashion from

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.800
a lot of his most famous
declarations in the early

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.900
1960s.&nbsp; So who is then
Malcolm X?&nbsp; Let's work

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.900
through the biography.&nbsp;
His birth name is Malcolm

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.100
Little.&nbsp; He was born in
1925.&nbsp; He's assassinated in

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.167
February 1965, less than a
year after he breaks from

00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:56.100
the Nation of
Islam.&nbsp; Now this,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.367
this little fact is
actually inconsequential,

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:00.967
but it is funny the way
we think about things,

00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:02.967
that Martin
Luther King is the,

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:05.600
you know, middle
class, moderate,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.300
grown-up and
Malcolm X, the fiery,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.200
youthful ambassador to
the Nation of Islam,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.067
in a sense.

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.500
But Malcolm X is older than
Martin Luther King by four

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.500
years.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.500
I mean, yeah, it's
kind of inconsequential,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.800
but it actually speaks to
the way in which we kind of

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.867
remember these people in our
minds.&nbsp; Both of them were

00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:33.900
very young men.&nbsp; So Malcolm
Little is born in 1925.&nbsp;

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.500
He's known over the course
of his life as Detroit Red,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.400
as Malcolm X most famously,
and finally as El-Hajj Malik

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.100
El-Shabazz.&nbsp; He's a
child, a middle child,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.100
of eight.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.400
His father's a
Baptist minister,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.400
and an organizer for Marcus
Garvey's UNIA.&nbsp; There's

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.800
different versions about
Malcolm X's early life and

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800
you know,
forgive me, I will,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.600
I will often use
Malcolm X in this lecture,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:08.600
just out of old habits.&nbsp;
There's not a whole bunch

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.500
about Malcolm Little's life.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.000
His father has died, either
murdered by a Klan-styled

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.667
group in Michigan,
the Black Legionnaires,

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.967
or died an accidental
death.&nbsp; In either case,

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.900
Malcolm's fatherless
at age six.&nbsp; The family

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.367
disintegrates.&nbsp; Malcolm
Little drops out of school,

00:13:30.367 --> 00:13:33.367
moves to Boston
and then to Harlem,

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:38.000
and becomes a hustler.&nbsp;
He's running numbers,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.500
selling drugs, he's pimping,
and is a petty thief.&nbsp;

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.567
During this era in his life,
he's adopted the street

00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:55.000
moniker as Detroit Red.&nbsp; At
twenty-one--and I've just,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and I've encapsulated, or
sort of put parentheses

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.900
around the first twenty-one
years of his life in just

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.800
that little biographical
sketch--at twenty-one,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.767
he's arrested and sent to
prison for burglary and

00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:10.000
larceny.&nbsp; He's given an
eight- to ten-year sentence

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.400
and ultimately serves six
and a half years.&nbsp; He's

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.100
paroled in 1952, about
twenty-seven years old.&nbsp;

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.067
While he's in prison, he
has a religious conversion.&nbsp;

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:24.067
He--while he's in prison,
he's converted to the Nation

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:34.700
of Islam, and adopts the
name Malcolm X.&nbsp; The X is a

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.500
reference to a long legacy
of African Americans who

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.400
were in an enslaved past who
were given the master's last

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.567
name.&nbsp; And X is a, is a
declaration that they are

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:50.667
wiping out the slave
name from their past,

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.667
and they're speaking
to an unknown past,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.600
but claiming it as their
own.&nbsp; [student sneezes]

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.767
Bless you.

00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:05.500
Anyway, Malcolm X, now, is
a member of the Lost Found

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.867
Nation of Islam in
the Wilderness of North

00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:11.200
America.&nbsp; That's the full
name.&nbsp; The Lost Found Nation

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.400
of Islam in the Wilderness
of North America.&nbsp; It's a

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.500
religious sect founded by
a rather shadowy person,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.100
we really don't know
much about him at all,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.100
named Wallace Fard,
founded around 1930.&nbsp; Fard

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.467
disappears under curious
circumstances.&nbsp; I've never

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:38.200
seen anything
convince--convincing of what

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.567
actually happened to Fard,
but one of the people he

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.867
brought into his circle
before he disappears is a

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.367
janitor in
Detroit, Michigan,

00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:52.800
in Detroit, Michigan named
Elijah Poole.&nbsp; Elijah Poole

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.400
becomes the spiritual
head of the religious

00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.000
organization known as the
Nation of Islam and renames

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.800
himself Elijah Muhammad.&nbsp;
Now the Nation of Islam is a

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.600
very unorthodox version
of traditional Islam.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.500
There's barely any
connection between the two

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.667
in truth, at least at that
moment in time.&nbsp; The Nation

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:21.667
of Islam grafts together
black nationalism and some

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:30.067
Islamic fundamentals.&nbsp;
Elijah Muhammad teaches,

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.800
through the Nation of
Islam, to his disciples,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.767
his followers.&nbsp; That
Muhammad taught--excuse me,

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:44.767
I lost my place in my notes
here.&nbsp; Muhammad taught that

00:16:47.367 --> 00:16:53.367
whites were a mutant
race of blue-eyed devils,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.200
created by, created by a mad
black scientist to persecute

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.067
black people.&nbsp; As
the messenger of God,

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:10.400
Elijah Muhammad would free
his followers one day when

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.000
Allah's apocalyptic wrath
finally destroyed whites.&nbsp;

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.500
In the meantime,
the black Muslims,

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.967
followers of the
Nation of Islam,

00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:22.200
the black Muslims would
offer hope to blacks through

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.100
self-discipline and
self-help.&nbsp; So the creation

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.900
myth revolves around a, a
crazed black scientist who

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:39.767
fashions whites to persecute
blacks.&nbsp; Just as bizarre as

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.200
any other creation
myth, I suppose,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.900
that's out there.&nbsp; Anyway,
this is what it is.&nbsp; And

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.400
that black Muslims would,
would be the population to

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.900
help blacks through
this time of struggle,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.267
through teaching
self-discipline and

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:58.700
self-help.&nbsp; This is one of
the reasons the Nation of

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.900
Islam is so
traditionally--been so

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.000
powerful at, or
so successful at,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.367
converting people who
are in prison.&nbsp; Teaching

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:13.267
self-discipline
and self-help,

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:15.400
being those things that
are most desperately needed,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.100
often, by those
who are in prison,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.000
after all.&nbsp; Teaching
race pride as well,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.567
independence.&nbsp; Anyway,
shortly after his release

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:34.267
from prison, Malcolm X meets
Elijah Muhammad and becomes

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:36.700
an assistant minister in
Detroit Temple Number One.&nbsp;

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.000
This is where the Nation is
headquartered.&nbsp; Malcolm X,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.267
despite the interesting
ways he's been historicized,

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:51.867
one cannot deny the fact
that he's an incredibly

00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:56.267
charismatic speaker,
powerful speaker.&nbsp; Elijah

00:18:56.267 --> 00:19:02.400
Muhammad recognizes this and
very quickly sends Malcolm X

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.600
to, to Harlem, and
establishes him as the

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.500
minister of the Harlem
temple.&nbsp; And although it's

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.667
not the headquarters
of the Nation of Islam,

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:18.200
because it's in Harlem,
sort of black Manhattan,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.567
it very quickly becomes the
most important temple.&nbsp; And

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:29.900
Elijah Muhammad asks, asks
Malcolm X to be his--the

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.900
national spokesman for
the Nation of Islam.

00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:38.200
So very quickly, Malcolm X
goes from jail to meeting

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.000
Elijah Muhammad, to becoming
assistant minister at the

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.200
Detroit temple, to becoming
the head of the Harlem

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200
temple, to becoming the
spokesman for the Nation of

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.467
Islam, although he's not
the head of the Nation of

00:19:47.467 --> 00:19:53.467
Islam.&nbsp; Under Malcolm X's
charismatic leadership,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.000
the Nation of Islam grows
exponentially.&nbsp; It's really

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.500
very small in the 1950s.&nbsp; It
grows from several hundred

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.700
followers to over ten
thousand by the early

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:15.600
1960s.&nbsp; Still rather small,
of course.&nbsp; As Malcolm X

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.200
continues to
speak and advocate,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.800
the membership grows and new
temples are established.&nbsp;

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.000
Radio stations are
purchased.&nbsp; Stores are

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
opened up.&nbsp; The Nation of
Islam in their early 1960s,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.100
late fifties, early sixties,
is tapping into a growing

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.000
disaffection
within black America,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.567
particularly urban and
northern black America.&nbsp;

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:45.367
This is a movement that is
overwhelmingly northern at

00:20:45.367 --> 00:20:48.667
this point in
time.&nbsp; The Steel Belt,

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.467
Steel Belt,
thinking along the,

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:54.400
the northern, middle
west of the United States,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.500
Ohio and Pittsburgh,
heading across to Michigan,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.167
is becoming the Rust Belt,
going through a period of

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:04.800
deindustrialization.&nbsp; The
jobs that caused blacks to

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.867
migrate north to the--after
the Second World War are

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:15.400
going away and they're stuck
in crumbling ghettoes.&nbsp;And

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.100
the rhetorical
flair of Malcolm,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.200
I'm sorry, of Martin Luther
King's speeches--this is

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.300
also the period of King's
greatest triumphs--aren't

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.000
doing anything to
change the daily quality,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.800
quality of life
for most blacks,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.267
particularly those living
outside of the South.&nbsp; So if

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:36.500
you're stuck in a slum
apartment in Detroit,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.500
Michigan or
Chicago, Illinois,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.100
the powerful rhetoric that's
coming from King and the

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.200
struggles in
Birmingham, Montgomery,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.500
and other places, they
aren't putting food on your

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.267
table, they aren't changing
what happens when you look

00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:59.700
for a job.&nbsp; Malcolm X's
rhetoric isn't necessarily

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.500
putting food on the table,
but when you marry the

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.400
rhetoric with the
establishment of these

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.567
temples and stores,
Nation of Islam stores,

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:12.700
and laundries--if you think
back to Marcus Garvey's

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.700
UNIA,
black-owned, entrepreneurial

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.767
opportunities, serving a
black community--that's what

00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:23.367
the Nation of Islam is
doing as well.&nbsp; If you tap

00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:26.867
into--if, if you are, are
listening to Malcolm X's

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:29.200
rhetoric and
actually going to a temple,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200
then maybe going to a store,
you're finding yourself in a

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.867
community that will help
you.&nbsp; So Malcolm X and the

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:42.900
Nation of Islam are tapping
into something sort of

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.067
festering, disillusioned
urban slum dwellers.&nbsp;

00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:51.500
There's growing skepticism
in black America about the

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.767
worth of integrating
into the white mainstream,

00:22:53.767 --> 00:22:56.967
with James Baldwin
famously saying,

00:22:56.967 --> 00:22:58.400
"Why would I want to
integrate into a burning

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.400
house?"&nbsp; There's a growing
increase in support for

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.900
violent methods to solve
problems and a surge in

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.367
nationalist sentiment among
African Americans not seen

00:23:15.367 --> 00:23:17.100
since the Garvey years,
since the height of the

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.200
Garvey movement in the
nineteen-teens and the

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.000
1920s.&nbsp; All of these
things working together are

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.800
increasing the numbers
in the Nation of Islam,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.667
developing a broader support
base.&nbsp; Now the Nation is a

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:40.700
religious organization and
was steadfast in its refusal

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.400
to get involved in
contemporary electoral

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.867
politics, very different
from Southern Christian

00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:49.967
Leadership
Conference, for example,

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:52.667
SNCC, other organizations.

00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:56.300
The Nation is a religious
organization.&nbsp; Had a very

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.400
conservative social view,
very much along the lines of

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400
Booker T.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.200
Washington's notions of
self-help.&nbsp; It is racially

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.600
separatist.&nbsp; It's not
embracing any of the

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.567
integrating logics of,
of SNCC at that point,

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:17.800
or NAACP, or other
groups.&nbsp; Malcolm X,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.267
in fact, had represented
Elijah Muhammad in the

00:24:20.267 --> 00:24:23.100
Nation in negotiations with
the national heads of the

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.500
KKK and the American Nazi
Party.&nbsp; Thinking back to

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.600
Marcus Garvey, believing
that the head of the Klan

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.800
was the most honest white
man in America.&nbsp; You have

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.400
the same kind of mentality
being expressed in the

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.867
Nation of Islam.&nbsp; But all is
not well with the Nation of

00:24:40.867 --> 00:24:46.167
Islam either.&nbsp;
There are whisperings,

00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:47.800
as we get into
the early 1960s,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:55.600
that Elijah Muhammad and
the allegations he's having

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.567
affairs with teenage
members of the Nation,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.700
whisperings he's actually
impregnated several members

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.600
of the Nation, and then
publicly rebuked the same

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.600
young women for fornication,
never naming himself in the

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.200
process and getting them
thrown out of the Nation.&nbsp;

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.300
There have been whisperings
for a long time about

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.100
financial improprieties, and
there's an increasing sense

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.700
of frustration,
certainly felt by Malcolm X,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.267
but also by other
members of the Nation,

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:38.200
that coming down from Elijah
Muhammad is a steadfast

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.200
refusal to get involved in
the politics of the day.&nbsp;

00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:45.467
There's also a tension
created by the fact that

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:48.767
Malcolm X is increasingly
popular and although he's

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:50.767
not the leader
of the Nation,

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:53.000
because he is the
spokesperson for the Nation,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
he is seen as embodying the
Nation.&nbsp; So we're in 1963.&nbsp;

00:26:03.467 --> 00:26:04.467
John F.

00:26:04.467 --> 00:26:06.100
Kennedy is
assassinated in November,

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.400
and Malcolm X, because he is
such a prominent individual

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:17.600
in the Nation, was asked
what he thought about this

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.667
moment, this moment of
great national tragedy,

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:23.600
and white and black
Americans are devastated

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.067
that the seeming prince of a
person had been cut down.&nbsp;

00:26:28.067 --> 00:26:31.300
And Malcolm X
very famously says,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.767
"It was merely a case of
the chickens coming home to

00:26:33.767 --> 00:26:39.000
roost."&nbsp; That's a response
that Malcolm X meant to use

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.667
to highlight the fact
that JFK lived by the sword,

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.867
and he was quite a
saber-rattler as a

00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:47.900
President, that he lived by
the sword and therefore he

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:55.000
was going to die by it.&nbsp;
Whether Malcolm X's comment

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.900
made any sense or not, it
was a comment that horrified

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.900
the country.&nbsp; Elijah
Muhammad saw this as an

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:11.400
opportunity, as it
turns out.&nbsp; He is getting

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.967
feedback,
whisperings as well,

00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.900
that Malcolm X is
becoming too popular,

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.467
that Malcolm X is, is
growing away from the Nation

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:26.300
and from Elijah Muhammad.&nbsp;
Elijah Muhammad is concerned

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.100
about his ability to control
Malcolm X.&nbsp;So Muhammad jumps

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.600
on this opportunity and
silences Malcolm X for

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.600
ninety days, based on that
comment.&nbsp; He was not allowed

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.500
to represent the Nation of
Islam and not to speak on

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:52.467
the Nation's behalf.&nbsp; Now
from a standpoint of public

00:27:52.467 --> 00:27:53.900
policy, it made
perfect sense.&nbsp; I mean,

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.900
this is such a, a
moment of anger,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.167
folks on the
Nation of Islam,

00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:06.500
that to have anything
less than silenced Malcolm X

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.200
would have been, would have
been seen as to support this

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:15.700
notion of chickens coming
home to roost.&nbsp; But the

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.300
truth really does lie
elsewhere in terms of Elijah

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:23.300
Muhammad's anxiety, growing
anxiety about Malcolm X and

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.900
his popularity, and
also because Malcolm X had

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.767
confronted Muhammad
about his affairs,

00:28:32.267 --> 00:28:34.667
that he'd heard that these
things were happening.&nbsp; He

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.900
was waiting for Elijah
Muhammad to refute them,

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:42.067
and he never could.&nbsp;
Financial improprieties,

00:28:42.067 --> 00:28:47.400
he couldn't refute
those either.&nbsp; During this

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.600
moratorium, this
ninety day silence,

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.667
it becomes clear to
Malcolm X that his silence,

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.667
his ban on public speaking
would not be lifted,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.867
and so he breaks from
the Nation of Islam.&nbsp; His

00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:04.667
speech, "Message
to the Grassroots,

00:29:04.667 --> 00:29:12.400
 which I spoke from at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:19.367
it's one of the last
speeches he gives before he

00:29:19.367 --> 00:29:25.000
breaks from the Nation.&nbsp;
And if you look back at it,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.600
you can see sort of the
handwriting on the wall,

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.400
because peppered throughout
Malcolm X's declarations

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.300
would be, you know, that
he speaks on behalf of the

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.600
honorable Elijah Muhammad.&nbsp;
"As the honorable Elijah

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.467
Muhammad says,"&nbsp;
"The honorable,

00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:41.100
honorable Elijah Muhammad
believes" this that and the

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.500
other.&nbsp; He can't say
it in this speech.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.700
He's growing apart.&nbsp; So the
split becomes official in

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.167
March of 1964.&nbsp; Malcolm X
establishes a religious

00:29:55.167 --> 00:30:01.500
organization called the
Muslim Mosque Incorporated,

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.500
and a political organization
called the Organization of

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:11.000
Afro-American
Unity, thus reflecting,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.667
or creating, this
two-headed--or maybe these

00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:23.767
two organizations on, on
separate paths.&nbsp; Certainly

00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:26.967
embodying a belief by
Malcolm X that broad social

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.300
engagement provided blacks
the best chance for ending

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.300
racism, not just a set of
personal belief systems,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.100
but also engaging the battle
on the ground.&nbsp; This was the

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.067
political
aspect of the OAAU,

00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:43.200
the Organization,
Organization of

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.500
Afro-American Unity that
Malcolm X felt was lost--a

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.067
lost opportunity for the
Nation of Islam.&nbsp; Before

00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.700
establishing the OAAU,
Malcolm X makes a hajj,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.700
a religious
journey to Mecca,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.567
and during that trip has a
stunning change of heart on

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:07.167
race relations.&nbsp;
Very famously in the

00:31:07.167 --> 00:31:12.300
Autobiography of Malcolm
X, written by Alex Haley,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:17.567
you see Malcolm X talking
about meeting Muslims who

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:21.900
were whiter than the whitest
person he'd seen in the

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.367
United States, blue eyes and
blond hair.&nbsp; He had a very

00:31:26.367 --> 00:31:30.100
sort of immature
notion of what traditional

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:35.667
Muslim--Islamic faith was
like and what Muslims would,

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:40.900
quote, "look like," even.&nbsp;
So whites are no longer the

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:48.067
blue-eyed devil in
Malcolm X's view.

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:50.500
His outlook, his
political, religious,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.700
and ethical outlook, which
certainly is revolutionary

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.700
while he's with
the Nation of Islam,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.067
becomes increasingly
anti-capitalist.&nbsp; And this

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:01.600
is something
we're going to see,

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.100
not just in Malcolm
X's belief system,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.367
but in other
leaders' belief systems,

00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:10.800
as we head into the mid and
late 1960s.&nbsp; Anti-capitalist

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.367
thinking and rhetoric
becomes much more important

00:32:13.367 --> 00:32:15.700
and is certainly a string
that ties a lot of these

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.200
individuals together,
although that linkage is

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.267
often not talked about.&nbsp; He
rejects his prior views on

00:32:23.267 --> 00:32:29.267
race.&nbsp; He rejects the
idea of black separatism.

00:32:29.267 --> 00:32:35.900
&nbsp;He rejects his
anti-Semitism.&nbsp; He rejects

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.300
his opposition to
intermarriage.&nbsp; All of these

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.200
are views that he espoused
while in the Nation of

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:48.700
Islam.&nbsp; He comes to
recognize that women

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.267
actually did have an
important role to play in

00:32:50.267 --> 00:32:56.267
the political struggle.&nbsp; And
he begins to accept and look

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:04.167
for--accept the idea of and
look for alliances of black

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:06.900
organizations with
other groups committed to

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:14.000
revolutionary change.&nbsp;
This is a complete change of

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.600
heart.&nbsp; His
prior views on race,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.900
race separatism, his, his
notion of the role Jews

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.567
played in the world system,
his anti-Semitic views,

00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:27.500
his opposition
to intermarriage,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.100
all of those are gone.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.700
Women might have a role in
the struggle.&nbsp; Whites are no

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.000
longer blue-eyed devils.&nbsp;
There could be other

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.600
organizations
blacks could relate to,

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.100
attach themselves to, as
long as they're working

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:48.500
towards revolutionary
change.&nbsp; In the end,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.767
Malcolm X acknowledged
that his political views are

00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:57.100
rapidly evolving, embodied
in the fact that he no

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.400
longer goes by Malcolm X.&nbsp;
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.400
the name he adopts during
this last conversion.&nbsp; He

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.267
admits, El-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz,

00:34:14.267 --> 00:34:18.267
that--when asked, that he
was hard-pressed to give a

00:34:18.267 --> 00:34:21.100
specific definition of the
overall philosophy which he

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.300
thought was necessary for
the liberation of black

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.700
people in the United
States.&nbsp; He didn't know at

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:31.000
this point what the right
answer was.&nbsp; This is between

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.967
middle of '64 and early
1965.&nbsp; Now Malcolm X is

00:34:37.967 --> 00:34:44.000
assassinated in February
of 1965 by members of the

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.067
Nation of Islam.

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:51.067
There's been rumor mills
running nonstop since then

00:34:51.067 --> 00:34:53.367
about who was really
behind the assassination,

00:34:53.367 --> 00:34:54.867
I mean, beyond the folks
who actually pulled the

00:34:54.867 --> 00:34:59.067
triggers.&nbsp; But was it a
man now known as Louis

00:34:59.067 --> 00:35:04.200
Farrakhan, someone
scrambling for attention

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.000
from Elijah Muhammad, who
inspired or gave directions

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.767
to the, the, the murderers?&nbsp;
Was it the FBI infiltrating

00:35:13.767 --> 00:35:19.567
the NOI, to find a way
to assassinate Malcolm X,

00:35:19.567 --> 00:35:21.500
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz,
although he's no longer part

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:26.800
of the Nation of Islam?&nbsp;
The debate's been going on

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:33.667
really, I mean, through
the very recent past,

00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:36.500
during bizarre sets of
events that leads to some

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.600
sort of
reconciliation, I suppose,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:46.600
with Louis Farrakhan and
Malcolm X's--one of his

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.100
daughters or
grand?--must be daughters,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.700
I suppose, and Louis
Farrakhan saying that,

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:57.400
you know, he apologizes if
someone had misinterpreted

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.300
his views or ideas in such a
way that they might--thought

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.900
it might be okay to
assassinate Malcolm X,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.800
one of these squirrelly kind
of apologies.&nbsp; Fact of the

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.667
matter remains
that Malcolm X,

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:13.167
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz,
is murdered February 1965.&nbsp;

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.800
What does he leave behind?&nbsp;
He leaves behind no great

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:27.300
leadership legacy,
but in terms of,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.767
you know, what
organization was left,

00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:30.800
what did he do, he'd broken
from the organization that

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.067
had defined
most of his life,

00:36:32.067 --> 00:36:37.000
his adult life.&nbsp; The
OAAU and the Muslim Mosque

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.467
Incorporated at the moment
of his assassination were

00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:43.500
really inchoate.&nbsp; His views
were shifting.&nbsp; He couldn't

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.000
answer the question, what
is going to be the most

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.867
successful means to
liberating black Americans?&nbsp;

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:50.900
He didn't know the
answer.&nbsp; But we,

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.500
you know, it's, even
though he leaves no clear

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.800
leadership legacy behind,
can he be judged by normal

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.467
standards of his
leadership--by normal

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:02.100
standards of
leadership?&nbsp; His martyrdom,

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.867
as it turns out,
gives him--gave him his

00:37:04.867 --> 00:37:11.967
legitimacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Critics have
said that his emotionalism,

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:14.667
his powerful
rhetoric, that he,

00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:18.600
he relied on it to win
his cases and it's also an

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.367
emotionalism that,
four years down the line,

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:22.500
three and four
years down the line,

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.000
lent themselves perfectly
well to the orthodoxies of

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.800
the late 1960s, something
we'll see in next week's

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:34.100
reading, Eldridge Cleaver,
Soul on Ice.&nbsp; So his ideas

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.900
were, you know,
the, the, you know,

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.567
the phrase is
sort of nonsensical,

00:37:38.567 --> 00:37:40.567
you know, a person
ahead of his time,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.800
the ideas that
become popularized,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.467
that were popular when
Malcolm X was alive,

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:48.500
become popularized
after his death,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.700
become the vehicle for
establishing sort of a

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.700
logic, organizational
logic, for groups,

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.000
that really don't even exist
when Malcolm X is alive.&nbsp;

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.967
Now martyrdom, certainly a
major element of the civil

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:09.867
rights movement.&nbsp; In
the time that remains,

00:38:09.867 --> 00:38:12.167
I want to actually
segue from this Malcolm X

00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:15.100
biography and, because we
have so much to cover on

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.800
Wednesday, shift gears a
little bit and start talking

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.000
about events going backward
over the last couple of

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
years of Malcolm X's
life, that spring from the,

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.467
the phenomenon, the
phenomena of martyrdom,

00:38:36.467 --> 00:38:39.967
what it does for people, or
for a race in this case.&nbsp;

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:45.500
This is an era of
martyrdom, you have Kennedy

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:51.767
assassinated, November 22nd,
1963.&nbsp; Then Johnson's now

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:56.900
the President and calls
for the earliest possible

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.400
passage of the
Civil Rights Act,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.100
something that was simmering
on the table at the moment

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.400
of John F.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.900
Kennedy's assassination.&nbsp;
And Johnson commits himself

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.300
for the rest of his time
in office to fulfilling

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.300
Kennedy's legacy on this
agen--on this score.&nbsp; That's

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:26.267
in sixty-three.&nbsp;
Little earlier than that,

00:39:26.267 --> 00:39:30.900
before Kennedy was
assassinated--and this gets

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.200
us to, if time permits,
right to this moment of

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.000
this, a
sec--another martyrdom,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.500
the Students--Student
Nonviolent Coordinating

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.467
Committee, SNCC,
starts working on voter

00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:48.300
registration drives and
organizes with other,

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.600
with other, gathers together
with other organizations to

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600
have what's
called a freedom vote,

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.667
the fall of '63.&nbsp; Plans are
developed '62 for the fall

00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:03.200
of '63, with the
goal of proving,

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.800
one, that blacks are
interested in voting.&nbsp; This

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.000
is all happening
in Mississippi,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.300
an important fact
I just left out.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.700
I just remembered, sorry.&nbsp;
The goal is to prove that

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.400
blacks are interested in
voting and to develop the

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.400
practice for the
eventual day when blacks in

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.200
Mississippi might
get the right to vote,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.100
helping develop the culture
of voting for blacks in

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.400
Mississippi.&nbsp; This
turns into Freedom Summer,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.600
1964.&nbsp; So now again
we're back after King's

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:35.800
assass--Kennedy's
assassination.&nbsp; The goal of

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.900
the Freedom Summer of '64
is to organize a real party,

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.100
the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party,

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.100
to establish freedom schools
throughout Mississippi,

00:40:49.567 --> 00:40:55.200
sites literally of training
Mississippi youth the basics

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.767
of education, literacy being
one of the basic elements of

00:40:57.767 --> 00:41:04.367
freedom schools, but also
creating community centers

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:06.300
for poor blacks to
come to get food,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.867
to get clothing, and
also to develop a political

00:41:12.867 --> 00:41:15.800
consciousness about the
future--about the present,

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.700
thinking about the future.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.800
In June of '64, June 20th,
first wave of recruits comes

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.000
down to help make Freedom
Summer a reality.&nbsp; It's

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.400
people your age, people
from Yale who are your age,

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.567
are among the
recruits, quite famously,

00:41:34.567 --> 00:41:38.467
a lot of them, coming
from college campuses in the

00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:40.800
North and the Midwest
and the West coast,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.100
coming to Mississippi to
try to create real change in

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:49.067
Mississippi, in, in
Mississippi.&nbsp; On June 21st,

00:41:49.067 --> 00:41:53.800
the day after Mississippi
Freedom Summer begins,

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.100
 three workers disappear,
Freedom Party workers.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.800
Andrew Goodman, a
twenty-year-old from New

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.667
York City,
Michael Schwerner,

00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:06.600
a twenty-five-year-old
from Brooklyn,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.167
and James Chaney, a
twenty-one-year-old black

00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:11.700
Mississippian.&nbsp; Two white
men and one black man.&nbsp;

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.067
They're
arrested for speeding,

00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:18.200
a fairly common offense used
by the police.&nbsp;&nbsp; Speeding,

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.367
you know it didn't matter
what speed you were actually

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:22.700
going; they just arrested
you for it.&nbsp; They were

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.600
released that night,
but understanding that,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:34.400
in Mississippi, they're
dealing with infrastructure

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.100
of police terror.&nbsp;
The organizers for the

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.800
meet--Mississippi Freedom
Summer had a process that if

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.200
you, if you get
arrested at all,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.700
that you check in.&nbsp; If
you're out in the field,

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.300
you check in at
normal intervals.&nbsp; Well,

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.000
Goodman, Schwerner and
Chaney did not check in at

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
the appointed time, or
within fifteen minutes of

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.200
the appointed time.&nbsp;
This sends out alarms.&nbsp;

00:43:02.767 --> 00:43:06.100
Compressing a lot
of history here,

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.600
but based on
their disappearance,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:14.900
LBJ sends in
sailors, Navy divers,

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.800
to start
drag--dredging swamps,

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.700
looking for Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney.&nbsp; There's

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.800
no doubt that they were
killed.&nbsp; They've just go to

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:29.800
find them now.&nbsp; What is
quite horrific in the

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.600
process of
looking for Schwerner,

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.767
Goodman and Chaney is that
the divers don't find them,

00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:44.300
but they start pulling up
other black bodies that had

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.900
long gone missing in
Mississippi and in other

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:52.900
states.&nbsp; Quite a state of
affairs.&nbsp; During the summer,

00:43:59.867 --> 00:44:04.700
up in Washington, D.C.,
there's frantic attempts to

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:11.600
organize the Congress, to
break filibusters in the

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.800
Senate, to get the civil
rights bill signed into

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:21.767
law.&nbsp; And on
July 2nd, in 1964,

00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:26.800
Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon
Johnson succeeds.&nbsp; It's the

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.567
most far reaching civil
rights bill in history at

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:32.800
that point, and it gives the
attorney general tremendous

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.267
power.&nbsp; And the
power, essentially,

00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:39.467
to enforce what is
already on the books in many

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:46.300
places.&nbsp; It provides for
full access in places of

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.200
public accommodation,
establishes a permanent

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.667
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.&nbsp; It says there's

00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:55.300
going to be no
discrimination in federally

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.567
funded programs, something
that really becomes

00:44:57.567 --> 00:44:59.667
important, I mean it's
important immediately,

00:44:59.667 --> 00:45:03.567
but becomes part of the
debate in the--up to our

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.567
present day, in fact.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.100
Now the Civil Rights Act
signed into law in July '64,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:16.600
it's largely irrelevant to
Mississippi blacks.&nbsp; Despite

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.467
all the work of the
Mississippi Freedom Summer

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:23.667
activists, and their
success at establishing the

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:24.667
Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party,

00:45:24.667 --> 00:45:28.567
essentially an alternative
to the Democratic Party in

00:45:28.567 --> 00:45:34.200
Mississippi, the fact is,
the chance for blacks to

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.767
actually vote
through, quote,

00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:41.967
"normal channels,"
"official channels,

00:45:41.967 --> 00:45:47.967
 is essentially
nonexistent.&nbsp; Still in the

00:45:54.067 --> 00:45:56.900
summer, Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney have been

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.867
disappeared, the civil
rights bill is passed but is

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:02.967
meaningless to Mississippi.&nbsp;
There are fights within

00:46:02.967 --> 00:46:04.700
Mississippi's
state delegation,

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.867
within the state government,
about trying to silence the

00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:11.800
Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party.&nbsp; Democrats

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:17.467
are heading towards a
convention in August for the

00:46:17.467 --> 00:46:22.300
Democratic Party.&nbsp; The
question is bubbling about

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.900
what is going to
happen in Mississippi,

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.700
which group of delegates
are going to be recognized.&nbsp;

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.200
Will it be the official
delegates of the Democratic

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.867
Party in Mississippi or will
it be the delegates of the

00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:39.500
Freedom Democratic Party?&nbsp;
LBJ is facing a threat that

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.967
five other southern states
would walk away if the

00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:43.700
Democratic Party--from the
convention if the Democratic

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.900
Party from Mississippi,
the "official delegation,

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.667
 is not seated at
the convention.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.300
And on August 4th, three
weeks before the convention,

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.100
the bodies of Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney are found

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.567
in an earthen dam,
near Philadelphia,

00:47:01.567 --> 00:47:07.800
Mississippi.&nbsp; Philadelphia,
Mississippi.&nbsp; The bodies are

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.600
riddled with thirty-eight
caliber bullets.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.200
Chaney, sole black
man, his head is,

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.800
I'm sorry, his skull is
fractured.&nbsp; He had suffered

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800
a savage beating.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.900
Mississippi law refused to
allow the three men to be

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.800
buried side by
side, as they wished,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.267
as their families wished.&nbsp;
Chaney had to be buried in a

00:47:30.267 --> 00:47:32.000
segregated
cemetery.&nbsp; Eventually,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.300
twenty-one
whites are arrested,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.100
including the
deputy sheriff,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.767
all released by a
state court.&nbsp; Eventually,

00:47:39.767 --> 00:47:43.167
six put on--into jail for
violating federal civil

00:47:43.167 --> 00:47:49.167
rights laws, are given three
to six years.&nbsp; David Dennis,

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.900
the head of
Mississippi's CORE,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.900
the Congress of
Racial Equality,

00:47:58.267 --> 00:48:02.800
when asked to give a
eulogy for James Chaney,

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.167
agrees to do so and to give
a calming eulogy.&nbsp; When he

00:48:07.167 --> 00:48:13.000
gets in front of the crowd,
in this moment of profound

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.800
emotional turmoil
and political turmoil,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.300
wrestling with the martyrdom
of these three men,

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.967
he snaps and says something
quite off the script,

00:48:24.967 --> 00:48:27.600
and that's exactly where
we'll pick up on Wednesday.

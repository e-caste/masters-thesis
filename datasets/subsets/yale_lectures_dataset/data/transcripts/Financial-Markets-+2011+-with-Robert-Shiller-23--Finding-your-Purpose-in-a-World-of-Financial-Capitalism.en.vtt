PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
All right.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.640
This is the concluding lecture
for ''Financial Markets.'' And

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.150
in this lecture, I want --

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.220
oh, I titled this lecture,
Finding Your Purpose in a

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.030
World of Financial
Capitalism --

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.960
but I just want to give a lot of
summary thoughts about the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.980
course and about your place
in the world of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.230
business and finance.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.410
So, we had two --

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.430
well, the major textbook for
this course was by Fabozzi et

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.800
al., and it gave you a lot of
detailed information about

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.890
financial markets and
institutions.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.050
Did you like it?

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm getting approval, I guess.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.780
I put you through something,
because I thought you have to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450
know that material.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.250
Finance is like a language.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.350
Well, it is a language.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.590
There's a lot of jargon, and
behind the jargon are

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:13.560
concepts, and I wanted you to
immerse yourself in that.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.240
I also assigned my manuscripts
for my new book, which is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.700
tentatively entitled Finance
and the Good Society.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.170
I'm still not sure, that that
will be the final title.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.320
Some of you have been offering
me suggested titles, and I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.700
appreciate that.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.990
You can never know what the
title of a book will be,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.130
before you publish it, because
someone else can always grab

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.310
the title, and then you've
got to change it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.075
But that book was about --

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.510
see, Fabozzi et al.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.030
is more about all of the
language of finance, and all

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.790
of the technical details.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.460
I wanted to supplement it with
something about the purpose of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.070
all this, and how it fits
into our lives.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.750
So, it's not done yet,
as you may be well

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.480
aware in reading it.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.250
My apologies.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.160
But I benefit from interacting
with you about it.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.130
It's a dynamic thing.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.910
I have a number of themes.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.820
They're all just kind of random
thoughts about the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.870
major things in this course.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.590
But I mean, I'm really thinking
this time about the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.870
kind of tools we've learned
about, tools that are

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.720
particularly useful for people
who specialize in finance.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.870
But I think, this almost should
be a required course

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.460
for everyone.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.690
Maybe, I'm just too enthusiastic
about it, but the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.650
way things get done in our
society is through financial

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.470
arrangements.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.210
And too many people talk in
vague terms, not, how are we

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.990
going to make something
happen?

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.520
And finance is about that, so,
that's why I think this course

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.630
should be --

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.000
there should be more students
taking it than are.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.960
I also said, that I think that
finance is not a purpose in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.420
itself, it's a tool.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.340
And that you should be building
your life around some

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.540
kind of purpose.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.500
There's a million different
purposes, so that's something

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.300
for you to create in
your own mind.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.660
But that's, where the meaning
of life comes from.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.470
So, another thing I've
emphasized in this course is,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.240
that finance is like
engineering, so you

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.220
have to design it.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.130
And once something is designed
and it works, it gets copied

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.340
all over the world.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.950
You all have learned
how to drive a car.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.390
Is there anyone here who
hasn't driven a car?

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.370
I won't ask for --

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.190
no one raised their hand.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.170
So, you have to know
a little bit about

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.790
mechanics to drive a car.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.290
Maybe not too much.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.190
But ultimately, what I wanted to
do in this course is, maybe

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.060
not teach you how to build a
car, but how to drive a truck,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.600
something big and powerful,
and get you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.010
beyond the simple things.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.440
So, finance, what does it do?

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.090
It does really important
things.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.680
It helps allocate scarce
resources, it incentivizes

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.540
people to do good work,
and it manages risks.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.420
And this is, what makes for
the developed world

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.430
that we have now.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.790
Another theme of this course
is about information

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.420
technology, which is something
that's rapidly expanding.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.360
I don't have to tell you that.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.640
But I think that it will change
the world of finance.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.460
The last 50 years have shown
tremendous changes, the next

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.445
50 years will show even
more dramatic changes.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.660
Or anyway, more specifically,
I have seven themes that I

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.270
want to cover in today's
lecture.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.800
The first one is just about
the morality of finance.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.510
I've been talking about this
here and again, but let me say

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.750
a little bit more about
that in concluding.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.550
My second theme is
hopelessness.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.240
There's a tendency for people to
think, that, at some level,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.520
because of the world's
problems, it's

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.500
all hopeless, anyway.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.820
I don't think it is.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.760
Well, I've come to --

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.160
I'll have to tell you
what I mean by that.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.530
Then thirdly, I just
want say something

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.940
about financial theory.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.740
Then to come fourth, to come
back to another theme, which

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.510
is wealth and poverty, which
I've talked about a lot.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.030
Then, the world of
the next century.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.560
And I think, one trend we'll see
is the democratization of

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.560
finance, that finance will
become much more of an

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.090
integral part of our
lives in a new

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.110
information-technology-enriched
world.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.630
And then lastly, I'll say
something about your career,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.580
whether it's in finance or in

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.980
something completely different.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.580
But I'm thinking, that there
is a good chance it has

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.935
something to do with finance.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.720
Let me start, though, with
the first thing,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.070
which is about morality.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.190
I have -- actually, the two
optional readings I have on

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.995
this part of the reading list
are both about morality.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.210
And one is the book by
Unger called Living

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.580
High and Letting Die.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.020
I think, it's a dramatically
well-written book, but on the

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:25.440
first page of the book, he
refers you to UNICEF, which --

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.110
actually, his book was written
before the web got popular.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.900
The book is 1994, I think.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.880
1996.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.530
He could have referred to the
web, but he gave the address.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.245
UNICEF is the United
Nations --

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.190
what does the I stand for?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.060
Children Educational Fund,
but what's the I?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.570
Can someone tell me?

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.620
They don't actually emphasize,
what it's spelled out.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.670
It's the United Nations fund for
children of the world, and

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.040
that's their website.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.320
So, he opens the book by saying,
why don't you get out

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.820
your checkbook right now and
mail in $100 to unicef.org,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:19.910
because the estimate, as of
1996, is, that UNICEF can save

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.480
a child's life for $3.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.880
So, you will save the
lives of 33 children

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.620
for your $100 check.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.400
How can they do that?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.550
How can they save a life?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.270
I think, maybe he's referring
to things like vaccination

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.420
programs, things that are
really cheap, that some

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.650
children are not getting.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.780
And so, statistically, you can
save a child's life for $3.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.480
So, he says, write out a check,
but of course, I can

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.960
tell you what to do, and that
is, just log on to that and

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.500
get out your credit card.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.300
And I don't know, if you can
save 33 lives with $100, but

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.280
maybe you can.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.150
So, when I first read the book,
I thought about that,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.870
and then I turned the page --

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.320
because most of us do --

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.270
and I realized later, a month
later, that I never had

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.590
written out $100 check.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.090
So, I finally did.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.640
I went on to unicef.org and
I gave exactly $100, as he

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.630
called for.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.700
Then, I started --

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.160
that was thought-provoking to
think about that, because why

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.560
did I stop at $100?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.470
Why is it that most of
us don't do that?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:39.100
There are intellectual defenses
we have -- we think

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.060
of ourselves as good people --

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.770
but if you were to see a dying
child, you would emotionally

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.230
be driven to do something,
if there was

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.500
something you could do.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.010
But somehow, when they're not
visible to us, we don't take

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.220
action to make them visible.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.180
What the book consists of,
Unger's book consists of is an

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.950
analysis of all the excuses we
give for not doing it, for not

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.560
doing that sort of thing.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.780
So, living our comfortable
lives and letting

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.650
other people die.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.320
And I think, it's really an
interesting book, because it

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.780
is referring to a paradox
of human behavior.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.040
I think of this as at the
juncture of philosophy and

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.140
psychology.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.480
And now, those two departments
are starting to --

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.580
I understand, I'm not in
either one of them --

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.750
they are starting to come
together, because they're

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.600
realizing that philosophical
issues are related to

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.850
psychological issues.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.580
So somehow, the human spirit
is very empathetic and

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.350
sympathetic in certain
dimensions,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.770
but not so in others.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.680
When you read his book, you get
a sense of meaninglessness

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.920
or loss of purpose.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.140
It's not entirely comfortable
to read it.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.265
He has a lot of examples
of moral dilemmas.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.740
I don't mean to find fault
with his book, but when I

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.780
think further about it, it
seems, that maybe the book is

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.050
a bit circumscribed by
the kind of moral

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.875
dilemmas that he poses.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:30.890
In some sense, moral
dilemmas are --

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.810
it's almost like there's a moral
imperative for us to

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.220
take action to do things.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.150
That's sort of what
he's getting at.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.700
But there's almost a moral
imperative to be

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.500
entrepreneurial to do things.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.840
I mentioned before, Paul Allen,
who was one of the top

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.160
people in Microsoft, who made
so much money and squandered

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.100
some of it, apparently, on
conspicuous consumption, but

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.750
on the other hand, gives a
billion dollars to charity.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.310
So, it seems to me that --

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.740
let's not conclude that people
who don't write the $100 check

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.520
are evil, and let's think
of the many, many

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.850
dimensionalities of morality.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.890
The other book I had on this
part of the course was by

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:37.150
William Graham Sumner, and
it was written over 100

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.260
years earlier --

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.310
1883 --

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.140
called What the Social Classes
Owe Each Other.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.810
And Sumner was actually Yale's
first real economist.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.610
Interesting person.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:58.370
He graduated Yale College in
1863, and he was hired by Yale

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:07.710
as a tutor in mathematics in
1866, and became interested in

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.270
economics and sociology.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.920
He has the distinction of
being the first American

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.090
professor to teach a course
called Sociology, and in those

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.320
days, there wasn't the
distinction between the social

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.410
sciences that there is now.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.920
So, he could teach both
sociology and economics.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.630
So, in his book, I think, he
started a Yale tradition of

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.790
conservative economics that
lasted until the 1940s.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.710
And then, Yale kind of drifted
more toward the liberal end.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:42.960
But he writes, anyway,
in 1883, "Is it

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.800
wicked to be rich?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:51.880
Is it mean to be a capitalist?"
And he says,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.100
first of all, it seems, if
capitalists are just richer

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.670
than other people -- he asks,
where's the dividing line,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.610
when someone is rich?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.020
So, is it wicked to be
above that line?

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.810
But where do you
draw the line?

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.240
And you learn from Unger,
maybe we're all wicked,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.360
because anyone who doesn't write
a $100 check every day

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.490
to UNICEF, when children
are dying around

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.840
the world, is wicked.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:28.730
What Sumner is saying, and it
seems to be a theme that

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:34.500
survives the centuries, in
favor of capitalists.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.890
I'll quote Sumner.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.890
"The great gains of a great
capitalist in a modern state

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:46.050
must be put under the head of
wages of superintendents.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.490
Anyone who believes that any
great enterprise of an

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.320
industrial character can be
started without labor must

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.060
have little experience
of life.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.960
Let anyone try to get a railroad
built or to start a

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.590
factory and win reputation for
its products, and he will find

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.680
what obstacles must be overcome,
what risks must be

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:14.950
taken, what perseverance and
courage are necessary."

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:20.550
I don't know, that I entirely
agree with Sumner, but he has

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:28.090
a point, that part of our
morality is to do good for the

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:34.420
world by doing things like set
up railroads, or Microsoft.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.590
And the kind of activities, that
that entails, will create

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.870
opportunities for conspicuous
consumption, but not

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.240
necessarily make that the
defining characteristic of

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.730
someone who does it.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:56.210
Nobody is perfect, and it's
hard to judge people

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.690
ultimately, but it seems to me
that there's almost a moral

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.170
imperative to entrepreneurship.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.680
Let me go on to the second theme
that I said I would talk

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.999
about, and that is
hopelessness.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:19.390
A lot of people, from their
education, get the idea that

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.040
ultimately there's nothing
we can really do.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.630
This is one of Unger's --

00:16:26.339 --> 00:16:30.630
Unger talks about
rationalizations we give for

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.420
not being moral, and he
calls it futility as a

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.620
rationalization.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.270
Ultimately, there's always going
to be starving people in

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.640
the world, and I can try
to help this child, but

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.730
something's going to
get him later, and

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.280
so there's no point.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.410
If you have that kind sense of
futility, it can justify any

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.560
amount of hedonism.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.690
But I think, that the classic
article that lends most people

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.090
to that sense of futility, and
I assume you know about this

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:13.560
already, but it's Malthus,
1798, his essay on --

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.380
well, the title of it is Essay
on the Principle of

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.660
Population.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:25.080
So, Thomas Malthus wrote about
the population problem.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.300
It was such a celebrated essay,
that he went through

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.970
six editions of it, but I'm
going to quote from the first

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.660
edition, just to remind you.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:41.770
He said, in 1798, "Population,
when unchecked, increased in a

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.590
geometrical ratio and
subsistence for man in an

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.500
arithmetical ratio."

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.130
So, the population
growth follows an

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.050
exponential growth curve.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.840
He says geometric, but
it goes like that.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.030
Whereas he said, at best, the
increase of our ability to

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.705
produce is linear.

00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:08.150
He calls that arithmetical.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.360
And so, the population
will run off

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.610
with all of our resources.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.660
There's nothing we can do,
population will continue to

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.300
put pressure on our resources.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:28.710
He says and I'm quoting again
from his 1798 essay,

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.440
"Population, when unchecked,
goes on doubling

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.640
itself every 25 years.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.740
If you go through two 25 periods
where there was no

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.920
check on population growth,
it is impossible'' --

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.020
I'm quoting him -- "to suppose
that the produce could be

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.260
quadrupled.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.535
It would be contrary to all our
knowledge of the qualities

00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:52.440
of land."

00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:00.090
And he comes now to his dismal
law of economics.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.900
He didn't call it that,
but I will quote him.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.380
"No possible form of society
could prevent the almost

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:14.180
constant action of misery upon
a great part of mankind if in

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:21.900
a state of inequality and upon
all if all were equal." So,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.250
the natural state of humankind
is bordering on

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.380
starvation and dying.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.700
The force of his argument was
quite profound, because it was

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.710
hard to argue against him, that
there's nothing you can

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.500
do about it.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.310
That's just it.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.090
And all the theorizing of people
can only result in a

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.150
world, where more people are
suffering and dying.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.500
If you want to think more about
this, I suggest you

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:58.740
might go to Robert Wyman, who is
a professor here at Yale on

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:05.810
Open Yale, which means it's
another of these courses open

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.350
on the internet.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.710
Has of course called ''Global
Problems of Population

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.640
Growth,'' where he spends a
whole semester thinking about

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.890
the Malthusian problem.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.790
One thing that he talks about
in that course is, that

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.530
there's a popular sense that the
population problem is not

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.260
so bad anymore, because many
countries have introduced

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.170
birth control policies.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.760
Notably, China has a one-child
policy, supposedly.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.110
It's not really a one-child
policy --

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.290
it's not enforced that well.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.450
It's more like a two-child
policy, or people have even

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.130
more than that.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:47.730
But other countries --

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.700
India, certain regions of
India have made great

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.730
progress, we're told,
on birth control.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:58.500
But still, despite that, Wyman
estimates that the world adds

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.010
a billion people every
twelve years.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.280
So, that's a problem, and our
resources are limited.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.390
So, the problem is, that people
are crowding into the

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.810
cities, because there's no room
for them on the land.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.180
They're trying to get an
education to push themselves

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.690
ahead, but the sheer numbers of
people make it impossible

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.230
for them all to get ahead.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:30.150
So, I suggest that you might
take his course.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.780
It's a problem that people
don't want to face up to.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.820
So, I'm sounding very dismal
here, but actually, I think

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:44.970
that the problem is not
as bad as it may seem.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.730
This is my take on it.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.330
I tend to be a realist
about these things.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.710
We have a population problem,
it's going to be with it us,

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.270
but, hey, it's been with us
forever, going all the way

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.150
back in history.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.360
So, it's a tough world that we
live in, because the human

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.390
race is naturally procreating,
and naturally creating

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.320
population pressures and
conflicts that lead to wars

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.070
and famines.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.440
We've been going through a
good run in the last few

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.050
centuries, but I don't
know when the end --

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.200
it's not an end --

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.400
when we're going to see more
severe problems, but that just

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.665
seems to be right
and inevitable.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.530
I think, that the weakest part
of Malthus' argument is the

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:46.000
last step, saying that it's
necessarily a dismal world

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.420
that results.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.940
I wanted to put the bright side
on Malthus' dismal law,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.690
and that is, most of the time,
everyone's fine in the world.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.230
Most people --

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.290
it's famines and wars are
intermittent events that

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.700
reduce population.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.550
Between those big events,
pretty much everyone

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.630
is doing all right.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.020
So I mean, maybe it's not
as bad as you think.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.560
You know, you might get killed
in a war someday, but you

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.280
enjoy life until that happens.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.040
I mean, that's very basic,
but I think it's true.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.760
Moreover, I think that there's
a lot that we can do to make

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:28.590
life better, even in the context
of the dismal law,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.890
even accepting the dismal law.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.700
And I think that civilization is
improving, so that life is

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.870
better, even though there are
population pressures.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.060
And that's why I think
there is --

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.120
maybe I'm saying the obvious
here, but I want to

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.430
say it anyway --

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.830
that there are plenty of
purposes and goals that people

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:57.770
can fulfill, even taking as
given Malthus' dismal law.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:03.830
I talked last period about
nonprofit and charity, and

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.840
government as well.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.060
There are a lot of people, who
are doing specific things to

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.800
make the world respond better to
the dismal law of Malthus'.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.440
And I wanted to mention certain
examples, just to make

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.810
this clear.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.500
I think, that there's work being
done by governments of

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.840
the world, there's also work
being done by individuals who

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.330
don't need government,
they set up their own

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.120
organizations.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.190
Specifically talking about
the environment.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.910
This is what's being threatened

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.400
by population growth.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.670
And so, there are many
foundations that deal with the

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.920
environment.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.920
I'll just mention a few.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.430
The Nature Conservancy, the
Worldwide Wildlife Fund, the

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.850
Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.310
And there are specialized ones,
like African Wildlife

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.090
Foundation, the Jane Goodall
Institute, the Diane Fossey

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.060
Gorilla Fund.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.950
You know, you think the gorillas
out there are wild,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.010
but there's finance
and support.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.920
They've collected money.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.930
Someone is managing an endowment
for the gorillas.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.990
This is creative finance.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.480
A part of the problem with --

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.890
you think about, what's
happening with the population

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.320
pressures of the world,
and is it bad or not?

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.980
Well, in some sense,
it's good.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.370
Having 10 billion people out in
the world would just make

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.070
for a more interesting place.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.330
There'd be more arts
and sciences, and

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.970
fun things to do.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.850
Eventually, we're going to
colonize the Moon and Mars,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.640
and there's going to be fun
trips to do, so, I don't know,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.580
if it's a bad world we're
coming into, even

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.860
if there are conflicts.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.850
But I think there are specific
problems with that world, and

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.610
one of them is the extinction
of species.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.990
You think about that, we're
destroying habitat for

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.850
species, and they're going
to be gone forever.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.470
But the thing is, that those
kinds of problems are problems

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.170
that have sort of business
solutions.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:26.090
I wanted to talk about one
particular foundation.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.310
It's a nonprofit.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.130
I'll just give this as an
example, the Nature

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.450
Conservancy.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:40.450
It was founded in 1951 in the
United States, but it now

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.670
operates in 30 countries.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:51.370
Its total assets are $5.6
billion, which makes it the

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:56.050
third largest charity in
the United States.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:08.880
And they have a principle of
''conservation by design.''

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.720
The idea is, our purpose is to
prevent extinction of species.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.100
Because extinction is forever.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.290
You know, these species have
taken hundreds of millions of

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.440
years to evolve, they get
wiped out, they're gone.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.280
As far as we know, they're
gone forever.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:30.660
So, what they do is, they get
scientists who specialize in

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.950
environment and biology, and
they say, which species are

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.580
endangered, and what can we
really do to prevent their

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.990
extinction?

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.810
And one thing that the
scientists have been telling

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.770
them is, that you have to
preserve habitat for species,

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.130
and you have to do it with
purpose and clarity.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.310
What do these animals need?

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.030
Some of them are migratory, for
example, and they migrate

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.040
over long distances, so you have
to preserve a migratory

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.060
route and stopping places
along the way for them.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.920
So, it has to be done well.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.290
So, the Nature Conservancy
believes, also, that the way

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:16.440
to protect habitat is to buy
land, and put up fences around

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.610
that to keep people out, and
then have a forest manager run

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:27.260
it, so that the species will
have it, will have that land.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.510
They say, that they have 500,000
square kilometers of

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.640
land that they've bought
around the world.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.930
I calculated, that there's 150
million square kilometers of

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:43.550
land on the earth, so they have
1/3 of 1% of the world's

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.900
land protected by
their charity.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.890
That might seem small, but you
know, that's a big difference.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.010
Because, if it's the last
habitat, that might be enough

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.070
to keep a lot of species'
diversity going.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:05.280
So, that's an example of what
-- this is really finance.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.600
We have portfolio managers
managing portfolios and

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.230
properties of land with
a good purpose.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.850
That's, where I say, the moral
dilemmas are not so simple.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.530
You could take a job managing
a portfolio for one of these

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.220
foundations.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:38.680
Peter Unger, in his book, is
talking always about, would

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.710
you save a child who fell
in the water or

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.020
something like that?

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:47.780
But that's not the kind of moral
dilemmas that we really

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:53.300
face, that an energetic
intellect would find.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.170
The moral dilemma is to prevent
big, bad things from

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.060
happening, and that takes a sort
of entrepreneurship and

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.380
big thinking to manage.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.940
Another thought I had in this
context is about wars.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.250
I was saying that population
pressures are a fact of life,

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:20.060
and I'm skeptical that anyone
will change the basic nature

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.750
of the situation.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:29.220
But I wanted, in this context,
to emphasize that financial

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:36.940
arrangements are capable of
enduring and surviving wars

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.720
and catastrophes.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.650
I wanted particularly to make
it clear, that there's a

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.230
tendency for people to think,
that finance is something that

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.056
the government runs.

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.330
You can easily get that
impression, because, when you

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.870
go into finance, the first thing
you have to do is get

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.690
licensed, and you have to file
some papers with either the

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.280
government or a
government-approved

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.210
organization.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.750
And then, you will find, there's
a whole list of laws

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.240
and regulations that you have
to memorize, and forms that

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.420
have to be filed with government
agencies, and

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.540
permissions to be granted.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.340
So, it sounds like this is
just the government.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.880
But I think, that's
the wrong view.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.290
I think that you should think
of finance as people making

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.640
arrangements with other people,
and governments are

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.700
helpful, and they enforce a
contract, but they don't

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.680
determine them.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.380
And in particular, I wanted to
give you a few examples that

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.630
clarify this.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:51.320
What do you think happened
after World War I with

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.130
financial arrangements?

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:57.960
Germany lost the war.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.690
People were really angry
with Germany.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:06.640
In the Versailles Conference
after World War I, Germany was

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.020
made to pay huge reparation
payments, payments that some

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.950
people thought were so heavy,
that the country will never be

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.440
able to do it.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.700
So, what do you think they did
to financial contracts?

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.790
Germany was at its knees, people
thought they were evil,

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.070
or many people thought
they were evil.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.780
Well, there was talk about
taking away -- people who own

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.660
stocks or bonds, let's just
confiscate them, and tell

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.430
them, you were in the wrong
country at the wrong time --

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.270
tough on you.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.000
Well, they talked about doing
it, but they didn't do it.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.890
The reparations were obligations
of the German

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.960
government, and they were
paid by taxing people.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.940
And they taxed people
in an equitable --

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.605
they didn't actually pay
them, by the way.

00:32:52.605 --> 00:32:54.050
The skeptics were right.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.620
Germany never was able to pay
the reparations, but it tried

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.200
to pay them by taxing people,
not by confiscating.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.250
Because ultimately, when it came
down to it, they thought,

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.750
well, Germans are all different,
and some of them

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.630
supported the war, and some of
them didn't, and some of them

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.510
saved all their lives, and
they've got a big amount of

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.449
money, so let's not confiscate
their shares.

00:33:15.449 --> 00:33:17.130
So, they didn't.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.380
That's my first example.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.699
Second example.

00:33:25.699 --> 00:33:27.679
Iran.

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:31.810
Remember, it was ruled by the
Shah of Iran, who was a

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:37.219
secular ruler, hereditary
ruler of Iran.

00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:43.889
Overthrown by a people's Islamic
revolution, and the

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:49.050
Ayatollah Khomeini became the
spiritual authority for the

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.219
new country, it became
much more Islamic.

00:33:52.219 --> 00:33:52.480
All right.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.750
So, what do you think happened
to financial

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.350
contracts in Iran?

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.840
In particular, the Iranian
government under the Shah had

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.520
a social security system, and
they were paying to government

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.280
employees' pensions.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.580
So, what do you think
the Ayatollah did?

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.110
A guy is working all his life
for the Shah, we've overthrown

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.070
the Shah --

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.290
do you still get your pension?

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.780
What do you think?

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.500
They did.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.270
They didn't cancel.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.960
I think, it's like
common sense.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.490
You come in, you are a totally
different government, now

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:26.540
you're a radical Islamic
government.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.760
Now, I don't say, that they
won't do some things that you

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:35.110
don't like, but they see the
basic financial contracts and

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.770
they preserve them.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.500
The other example I'll
give is South Africa.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:49.200
And that is, in 1994, the white
apartheid government was

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.450
replaced by a government that
was elected by the black

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:55.155
majority in South Africa.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.640
So, what do you think
happened to their

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.090
pensions or their insurance?

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.440
Where they confiscated?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.670
No.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.580
So, I think that this is
a principle in history.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.360
Now, I can give other examples,
of course, where

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.660
things went badly.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:17.410
Vladimir Lenin wasn't so kind
to stockholders in Russia

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.910
after this Russian Revolution.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:25.560
Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico
nationalized the oil industry.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.410
Mao Zedong --

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.790
you know who he is,
in China --

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.950
not kind to capitalists.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.730
Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran
nationalized the oil industry.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:44.490
Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt
nationalized a wide range of

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.020
industries.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.700
Even in India, Indira Gandhi
did widespread

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.530
nationalizations that were
effectively confiscations.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.330
Even the United States has in
some sense been involved in

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.790
those sorts of things.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.830
After World War II, the United
States was not going to

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:07.080
confiscate wealth of wealthy
people in general, but in

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.840
Japan, there were these
wealthy families that

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.460
maintained industries,
called Zaibatsu.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:23.230
These were the family-owned
businesses that dominated

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:27.230
Japan before World War II.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:35.710
The big four, Mitsubishi,
Yasuda --

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.010
who else?

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.570
Mitsui --

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.480
and what am I thinking of?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.330
It's not in my notes.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:47.560
But these big, wealthy families
were thought to have

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.600
supported the war and made Japan
into more radical than

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.780
it would have been.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.360
So, there was a lot of U.S.
thinking that we had to break

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.800
up the Zaibatsu.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.730
So, what the United States did
was, force these families to

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:10.250
convert their holdings of
industry in Japan into

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.310
yen-denominated government
bonds.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.210
And then, the Japanese
government had a huge

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.420
hyperinflation and
wiped them out.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.700
So, it wasn't actually
a confiscation.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.240
The U.S. government didn't
deliberately confiscate the

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:29.640
wealth of the Zaibatsu, but
they effectively did that.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.880
By the way, we still have
Zaibatsu in Japan, but they're

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.870
not owned by those
families anymore.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:39.060
The same industrial
conglomerates still survive.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.970
Third topic, I was saying
I would talk about is --

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.120
maybe I'll be brief about
this -- the importance

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.370
of financial theory.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.120
I'm an advocate of two seemingly
disparate things,

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.820
and you know this from
this course.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.970
One of them is Mathematical
Finance.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:07.070
We spent some time on it, but
not very much, because there's

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.140
another course -- it's
also on Open Yale --

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.990
that John Geanakoplos has
on Mathematical Finance.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:21.950
But the other side of it is
Behavioral Finance, which is a

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.930
particular passion of mine.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.530
And Behavioral Finance is the
application of psychology and

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.470
other social sciences
to finance.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.620
And I think, that the two
actually work together

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.060
symbiotically, and that we
should consider them together.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.120
Some people in Mathematical
Finance are very opposed to

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:49.590
Behavioral Finance, because it
kind of muddles their world,

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.780
but in fact, I think, they
should consider it their

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:57.500
salvation, because without
Behavioral Finance, they're

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.370
kind of bordering
on irrelevant.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:05.120
You have to consider things in a
broader context and think of

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.310
the interruptions and problems
that are caused.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.630
I said, the next topic I would
talk about today is --

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.100
I've already been talking about
it a bit -- is about

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.430
welfare and poverty.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.670
It seems to me, it's
fundamentally connected with

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.290
our thoughts about finance,
because --

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.090
I've referred to this problem
before, that people think,

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:33.070
that people who go into finance
are money grubbers.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:38.490
They want to make money, they
don't have human feelings or

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.770
something like that.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:47.850
And there's also the sense, that
we're living in a world

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.900
that's increasingly plutocratic,
that the wealthy

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.415
people are controlling
the world.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.010
That was a theme that took a
lot of impetus in the 19th

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.560
century with Karl Marx,
who said exactly that.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.440
And in some sense, it's
coming back --

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.840
maybe in not such
an extreme form.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.930
So, Jacob Hacker, who's in our
political science department,

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:23.030
and Paul Pearson, who's at
Stanford University, have a

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.860
new book that just
came out called

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:32.340
Winner-Take-All Politics.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:38.160
And that book is about --

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.720
they have a claim in that
book, that the world is

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:47.050
getting more polarized by the
political power of financial

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.090
institutions.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.055
Basically, they have something,
they call the ''30

00:40:51.055 --> 00:40:53.650
years war.'' What's
the 30 years war?

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.050
You might think, it's something
that happened in the

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.420
17th century.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.450
Not for them.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.990
The 30 years war is the war
against the people of the

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:05.290
world, fought by the financial
community in the halls of

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.480
Congress and Parliament,
by lobbying.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.040
So, they argue that the
companies have gotten more and

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.980
more sophisticated in lobbying
governments to fulfill their

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.610
ambitions, and so, the income
inequality that we're seeing

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.630
increasing, particularly in the
United States, but also

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.680
elsewhere in the world, is
a consequence of this.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.640
So, Hacker and Pearson say --

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.300
much of the literature on income
inequality says, it has

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.130
something to do with the
information revolution, which

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:45.970
is eliminating jobs for low
income people, and the

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.350
increasing importance of
education, which rewards

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.370
college graduates at
the expense of

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.520
uneducated people --

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.380
but they say, that the real
increase in inequality has not

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.760
been between high school
graduates and college

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.150
graduates, it's between the
whole population and the top

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.940
tenth of a percent.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.270
There is this small community of
super rich people, that is

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.940
developing, who are very adept
at lobbying governments.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.080
This is a trend that's
developing.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.630
Well, I think to some extent,
they are probably right.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.830
I think, maybe they overstate
that, but I think, it's a

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.890
concern, but I think, that
we do have democratic

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:39.110
institutions, and we can
respond to that.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.690
So that I think, maybe, they
overstate it, because

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.130
I think that --

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.510
I've met billionaires
in my life --

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.440
I have a sense, that
they are not --

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.560
I haven't met enough of them
to make generalities about

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.140
billionaires --

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.070
but maybe, they have a little
bit of a self-serving

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:03.440
mentality, but in some sense
they seem not to care.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.050
They don't want to be viewed
as evil, they want to be --

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.610
a lot of what drove them to
become billionaires was a

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:16.540
sense, that they would be a
benefactor of some sort, and

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.630
so they're ready to
give it away.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:22.860
Anyway, that may be a
casual impression.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.720
But one thing that angers people
about wealth is the

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.830
tendency of wealthy people to
build monuments to themselves.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.510
So, I was thinking of that, when
I was at the J.P. Morgan

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:39.620
Library in New York, and also
there's something called the

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.850
Metropolitan Club, which is
another building that he built

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:50.220
to himself, this huge mansion
in Manhattan that he built.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.750
And I was thinking, is
J.P. Morgan evil?

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.020
I mean, people are starving in
the world, and he's building a

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.570
mansion for himself.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.080
But then, I reflected
further --

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.360
here, I am having dinner
in his mansion.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.740
He's gone.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:14.150
And is it really so bad in
the scheme of things?

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.910
I guess, you can view it
in different ways.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:34.550
You can view J.P. Morgan as a
great success, who ended up

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.590
helping the world, or you
can view him as a

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.755
selfish monument builder.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.790
His life overlapped with Karl
Marx, that I told you about.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:54.310
But one of Karl Marx's
themes was, that

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:56.330
the system is unfair.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:57.850
That some people
have capital --

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.750
that was a theme of his book,
Das Kapital -- some people

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.940
have capital, and they are
wealthy as a result, and they

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.900
will continue to be wealthy,
and they'll make their

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.910
children wealthy as a result.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.460
I actually have a quote
from Karl Marx.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.370
"It is not, because he is a
leader of industry that a man

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.530
in is a capitalist. On the
contrary, he is a leader of

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:22.370
industry, because he is a
capitalist. The leadership of

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:26.090
industry is an attribute of
capital, just as in feudal

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:31.510
times the functions of general
and judge were attributes of

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:37.990
landed property." That comes
from his book, Das Kapital, in

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.020
the 19th century.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.730
So, Marx thought, that ownership
of capital was like

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:52.000
a key to the good life, and
that the population was

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.990
excluded from that.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.490
But I'm going to come back
to the democratization of

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.770
finance, but it seems like
capitalism -- it isn't

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.230
essentials to capitalism
that some social

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.790
class dominates capital.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:14.600
We can have a capitalism that
is divided up among --

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.780
that is more people's, it
belongs to people, and there's

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.640
not a privileged class.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:28.840
So, I another thing I wanted to
talk about is my concern --

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.810
Marx was impressive --

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.380
I think I may have said
this before --

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.870
he was impressive, because he
read emerging sociology.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:40.020
And the sociology of his day
was beginning to recognize,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.630
that people do form themselves
into social classes, and have

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.290
a sense of loyalty to others
in their social class.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.290
But I think, that anything
he said is of limited

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:51.930
relevance today --

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.880
was always of limited
relevance.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.570
Interesting, but wrong
in many ways.

00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:08.060
I'm thinking of the works of
another important thinker,

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:15.370
Robert K. Merton, who was a
sociologist at Columbia.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:21.630
He was the father of Robert
Merton, the economist, who

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.460
helped develop option theory.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.500
But Robert K. Merton referred
to, what he called the

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:35.310
''cosmopolitan class.'' He was
looking at social classes.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.570
He picked a small town in the
United States, and interviewed

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.920
a lot of people, and was trying
to understand their

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.670
class structure.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.250
You know, who do you
identify with?

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:47.970
Who are you loyal with?

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:54.330
He was a deep thinker, I think,
and looked at what

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.040
really seemed to separate
people.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.300
And he decided, that, in this
little town, that there were

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.220
really two classes of people.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.290
He called them cosmopolitans
and locals.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.550
So, the cosmopolitans had a
very different worldview.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:18.580
They tended to not care about
what's going on in their town.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.860
They would talk about national
or international things.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.670
He'd listen to what they say.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.510
They were focused outside,
they thought the town was

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.700
irrelevant, and they tended
to have maybe

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.930
higher-level positions.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:35.980
The locals were people, though,
who would talk all

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.170
about their town, and
they would talk

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.880
about people they know.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.740
They seemed to value their
connections within the town.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:50.070
And when you asked for opinions
about the local town,

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:54.130
the locals would tend to give
almost loving expressions.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.670
This is a great town, we have
a great people here.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.900
And the cosmopolitans would act
totally indifferent, and

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.280
they don't know anybody.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.940
They don't know, who's the head
of the fire department,

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.190
or who holds the --

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.900
maybe they know the principal
the school, because they may

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.380
have their kid in the school,
but beyond that, they don't

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.440
know anything about
their town.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.190
So, Merton wrote that
over 50 years ago.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.580
I have a sense, that it's
developing further, this split

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.140
between cosmopolitans
and locals.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.610
And it's developing
on a world scale.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:32.940
There's now a world cosmopolitan
class, and with

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.730
increased communications we're
kind of split that way.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.570
So, people around the world
who are learning to speak

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.520
English well, that's the world
language, people who travel

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:53.620
around the world, and people
who are finance savvy, they

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.230
are developing into
a social class.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:01.710
And I think, that there are
animosities and conflicts, but

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.800
it's a little bit harder,
because the cosmopolitans are

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.160
so scattered and they're
relatives of us, so it's not

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:14.840
as intense a social contrast.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.590
But you know, I think, that the
animosities that we are

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:22.420
feeling now have to do with the
fact, that cosmopolitans

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.190
know and understand
finance, and they

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.820
have lawyers and advisors.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:34.540
The rest of the population
feels excluded from that.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:41.080
So, that brings us to what I
said was the democratization

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.650
of finance.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:47.820
And this is a theme of my own
that I've been emphasizing.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.500
So, the democratization of
finance is sort of trying to

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:56.040
make it move beyond the
cosmopolitan class.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:01.110
So, cosmopolitans know how to
get things done, how to raise

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:08.360
capital, and they know how to
manage their risks, so they

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.250
don't get into trouble.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.380
Inequality is substantially
due to a

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.536
failure to manage risks.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.420
Right?

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:25.130
I mean, some inequality is due
to fundamental things, like

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.620
someone is talented and
can make more money.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.760
But it's also due to random
things that are not

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.260
controlled.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.500
Notably, in the current
financial crisis, we saw a

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.730
huge drop in home values.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.130
And we saw people, who bought
homes at the top of the

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:44.620
market, and then they find, that
their mortgages are worth

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.900
more than their homes are,
and so they have a

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.730
negative net worth.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.560
They're in trouble, they
would be bankrupt --

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.750
maybe they're not bankrupt
yet, but they're

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.080
verging on that --

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.170
they're very unhappy.

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:02.850
This was a failure, I
think, of bringing

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.210
finance to the people.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.270
So, it's not democratizing
finance --

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.755
we haven't finished
democratizing finance.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.330
So, it's kind of chaotic,
the way things

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:19.070
work for most people.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:23.020
Most people who, a, do not have
a lawyer, b, do not have

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.860
a financial adviser, c, do
not have an accountant.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:33.090
Or maybe they go to some
storefront tax-paying service,

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.940
but that's as far as they go.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.000
And these people make a
mess of their lives.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.910
So for example, we have laws
that allow people to go

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:48.580
bankrupt and wipe
off their debts.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.420
All you have to do, if you are
in trouble, financial trouble,

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:58.160
is go to a lawyer and say, can
you help me file for Chapter 7

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.750
bankruptcy?

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.990
I'd like to wipe out
all my debts.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:05.170
But usually, you have to have
$1,000 to pay the lawyer to

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.310
help you do this, and these
people can't get it together

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.620
to do that.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.460
So, what happens?

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.300
What happens to this typical
person, who is uneducated, has

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.190
gotten deeply in debt?

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.000
What do you think happens?

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.770
Do they ever declare
bankruptcy?

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:21.380
No.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:21.880
What do they do?

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.920
They stop answering the phone,
because they're getting these

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.880
dunning calls from creditors.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.680
And so, the creditors then --

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.790
it's called informal
bankruptcy.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:36.810
They will go to court, and ask
the judge to allow them to

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.870
garnish the wages of the person
who won't pay and won't

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.750
answer the phone.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.900
So, they'll take another
deduction from the person's

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.380
paycheck, eventually.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.750
The person never
figures it out.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:51.200
His paycheck just went down,
he is paying off his debt.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.220
What a mess.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:58.560
But that's because of the
failure of financial

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.820
institutions to handle
things well.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.660
So, Elizabeth Warren,
who is at --

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.730
I mentioned her before --

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:11.420
at the Harvard Law School has
written a couple of books

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.760
about these problems
that people face.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.020
And it's a testimony to the
success of our democratic

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.450
government, that she managed to
persuade Dodd and Frank to

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:32.740
put it in their bill, the
Consumer Financial Protection

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:40.530
Bureau, which would create a
government agency that would

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:47.520
try to limit the abuse
of lower income,

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.410
less educated people.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:54.610
We were hoping, that she would
be made head of her bureau,

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:58.970
but it turns out, that
she's only acting --

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.790
I forget what her exact
title is --

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.830
transitioning into finding
a head for the bureau.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.930
Because the lobbyists that I
told you about, representing

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:12.000
credit card or the mortgage
industry, are adamantly

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.810
opposed seeing her put on
as head of the bureau.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.360
So, it looks like it's
politically impossible to put

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.550
her in charge of it, but she's
at least involved in helping

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:27.220
pick the person who would
make that happen.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.930
So, I think these are nice
steps forward, but I

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.790
wrote a book --

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:39.997
let me just mention my own book
-- in 2008, called The

00:55:39.997 --> 00:55:41.247
Subprime Solution.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.370
And so, I was trying to
think of the future.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:55.670
Again, I'm trying to think
creatively and expansively

00:55:55.670 --> 00:56:00.770
without thinking punitively,
as Elizabeth Warren seems

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:01.900
often to do.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.540
Her view tends to be, that there
are exploiters who need

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.150
to be regulated.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:09.590
But I'm thinking, that maybe
there's something

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.130
positive we can do.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.110
So, I have various ideas.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:18.470
Also, I had -- this
was 2008 --

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:28.300
I also had another book, The New
Financial Order, in 2003.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.350
I'm getting on toward 10 books
now in my life, and I'm having

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:33.070
trouble remembering which
one is which.

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.010
I was just commenting
to my wife, it's a

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.600
little bit of a problem.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.440
But somewhere in these books,
one of the ideas I had --

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.080
actually, it's in The New
Financial Order --

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:50.020
is for livelihood insurance
that would help protect --

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.390
this is a financial institution
that would protect

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.980
people's livelihoods.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.180
I viewed it as an expansion of
something that we've got

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.360
already, called disability
insurance.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.620
In fact, it's been offered by
the government in the United

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.570
States as part of the social
security system, but it

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:09.010
handles certain insurance
against certain specific kinds

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.880
of risks to livelihoods,
namely health risks.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.540
If you become paralyzed, if you
become mentally ill, any

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.180
of those things that
a doctor can attest

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.860
to, is insured already.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.590
Very important, because things
like that happen to people and

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:26.990
they can't earn a living
anymore, and it happens to

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:28.020
young people.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:31.760
And so, we have private
insurance, the government has

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.720
taken over part of disability
insurance, but there's also

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.520
private disability insurance.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.970
But none of this covers the
biggest threats to people's

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:40.990
livelihoods.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:47.590
Most threats to livelihoods are
not due to medical events.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.380
It's economic events
that make you --

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.980
you know, you're 40 years old,
you've trained for, let's say,

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:59.230
nuclear engineering, and then
we have the Fukushima or the

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.600
Sendai disasters, and then
suddenly no government of the

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.080
world wants to build nuclear
plants anymore.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.990
So, here you are, you're 40
years old, you're reaching

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:11.340
your prime, you would normally
be making a good, high income,

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.370
but now it's useless.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.050
No fault of your own.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:19.020
This is a risk that you cannot
now insure, and it's part of

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.350
the thing that contributes
to inequality.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.680
And so, I think that we can
insure those things, and in

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.610
the future, as finance develops,
these are some of

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.040
the missions that
we have to do.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:35.860
Another thing is home
equity insurance.

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.340
I mentioned before, that the
crisis was caused by failure

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.860
to insure against
home price risk.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.420
I've been working on
trying to get home

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.770
equity insurance started.

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:53.700
Some of my colleagues at Yale,
Will Goetzmann and Barry

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:59.430
Nalebuff particularly, have
actually created an insurance

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:03.360
policy that would insure homes
against price declines in the

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.600
city of Syracuse, New York.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.780
Didn't really take off,
so this is still

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.400
not happening yet.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.630
But here's the idea --

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:15.440
you can buy insurance against
your home burning down.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.530
That goes back 300 years.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.520
But how often do homes
burn down?

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.350
Not very often.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.320
What's the real risk
that you face?

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:27.400
It's the loss of economic
value of a home.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:35.080
And so, that is not insured
anywhere in the world.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.990
Why not?

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.400
We could insure it.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.080
I think, these are things
that would --

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.850
developing home equity insurance
or livelihood

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:45.420
insurance would be
positive steps.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:48.600
I have one more example from
this book The Subprime

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.430
Solution, something
that I call a

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:57.085
continuous workout mortgage.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.730
In the financial crisis today,
right now, there are 2.5

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.480
million households that are on
the verge of defaulting on

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.740
their mortgages --

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.810
haven't yet, but they are at
risk of defaulting and being

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.430
thrown out of their houses.

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:19.120
So, that's something like close
to 10 million people.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.870
Big time event.

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.810
Why is it that they're
being thrown out?

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:25.020
Well, because their home value
has dropped, maybe they're

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.910
unemployed, their income has
dropped -- we still have 8.8%

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.440
unemployment --

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.790
and they can't pay
their mortgage.

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:35.710
And maybe, they think it's
futile, because they're paying

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.840
a debt that is bigger
than their wealth.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.210
So maybe, they don't feel in
a very good mood about it.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.900
They go back to the mortgage
lender and ask for a workout,

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.680
and the mortgage lender
typically says no.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.090
The government has done a
sequence of programs to try to

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.260
encourage the servicers of
mortgages to do workouts, that

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.420
means lower their payments or
somehow worth make it easier.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.900
But it's been disappointing.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.820
They haven't succeeded in
getting cooperation on these

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:09.090
programs. It's one of
the big tragedies of

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.620
the financial crisis.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.650
So, what I proposed is, that
we should think forward.

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.360
I don't know, how we can solve
this mess right now, but think

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.310
about in the future, having
mortgages that have a

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.510
pre-planned workout.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:32.590
And the workout would
lower the cost of --

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:35.180
lower the payment
on the mortgage.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.080
Continuously, not just --

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.590
the other problem with workouts
is, even when people

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.760
get a workout on their mortgage,
they default anyway,

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.810
because things get
even worse later.

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.140
And you've got one workout, you
go back and say, I'd like

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.380
another workout.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.130
They say, you have got
to be kidding.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:53.660
And anyway, the government, like
the HAMP program, that

01:01:53.660 --> 01:02:00.030
the Obama administration has
promoted, has only one workout

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.140
for each family.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.015
So, I think they should be
continuous and automatic.

01:02:05.015 --> 01:02:13.620
And they don't require anyone
to apply for a workout.

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.030
So, how much time do I have?

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:24.970
I think I'll move to my last
subject, which is your career.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.310
Because you are young people and
you may be wondering what

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.560
you want to do.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.870
I think, I maybe have reflected
on this before.

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.840
You probably feel, that you
want to do something

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:55.960
important, and you want a sort
of perfect career, something

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.770
that tells a story, makes
a story of your life and

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.675
ultimately serves
for good causes.

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:13.070
But when you read Unger, you
don't get an inspiration like

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:13.710
that, right?

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:14.460
You get --

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.020
he says, write a check
right now to UNICEF.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.550
Well, I can do that, but it
seems unrewarding just to give

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.970
to charity.

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.560
I can just live like
a monk, right?

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.040
I could take a job at a
hamburger joint, and then give

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.000
all my money away to UNICEF.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.260
Somehow that doesn't feel --

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.290
I think, that you know, that
you have abilities, and you

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:44.050
want to see them flourish,
and you want to --

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:47.070
that's why I think, you
shouldn't be flipping

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.710
hamburgers and giving
the money away.

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.460
That's not what you should
be doing now.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.470
And instead, it would be
learning things that make it

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.520
possible to do good works.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.680
What is the perfect career?

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.310
I mentioned Paul Allen
or Bill Gates.

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.680
Bill Gates --

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.710
I shouldn't give you an example
of dropping out of

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:17.600
college, but he dropped
out of college.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.980
And by the way, you should
do that, if you have a

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:24.875
Microsoft-size idea, but I think
I've said this before.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:36.510
I don't know.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.580
What is the perfect career?

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.070
I'll give you another example.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:40.650
Mohammad Yunus.

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.900
You've heard of him.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:52.920
He went to a Ph.D. program at
Vanderbilt University, got his

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:58.160
Ph.D. in 1969, became an
assistant professor of

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.360
economics at Middle Tennessee
State University.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.190
But then, the big thing that
he did is, he went back to

01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:12.080
Bangladesh and founded
the Grameen Bank.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:23.070
The Grameen Bank, which
specialized in making

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:28.020
microfinance loans
in Bangladesh,

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.651
and that was in '76.

01:05:28.651 --> 01:05:28.717
[clarification: Mohammad Yunus
started making microfinance

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:28.827
loans in Bangladesh in 1976,
but the institution of the

01:05:28.827 --> 01:05:32.410
Grameen Bank was not established
until 1983.]

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:37.140
Grameen apparently means ''of
the village'' in Bengali.

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.480
But what he did is, he conceived
of a new way of

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.700
making loans to very
low-income people.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:50.000
Banks before Yunus didn't have
much interest in lending to

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.380
low-income people, because the
costs of administering the

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.520
loan seemed to be too high,
relative to what

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.950
you could get back.

01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:00.310
But he had a scheme for
getting people to

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:02.960
pay back the loans.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.450
Often, they would make loans
to women in groups --

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:10.200
impoverished women, but he would
lend to the whole group

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.110
and say, that the whole group is
jointly liable to the debt,

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.160
that's the only way
we'll make it.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.740
And it's for business, for
starting a business, like

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.760
getting a wheeled cart,
where you could

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.440
sell food on the street.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.690
Some simple, low business
like that.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:27.650
You can't do it, unless you get
a little bit of capital,

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.110
enough to buy the cart
and buy the first

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.030
food to start selling.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.230
And these women can't get that
capital, but when he makes it

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:40.800
available to them as a group,
they then interact with each

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.040
other and enforce the good
behavior of each other.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.710
And it's a system that worked.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:51.020
So, he won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2006.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.730
It was not the prize in
economics, it was

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:54.740
the prize in peace.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:00.250
So, that's an example of the
kind of careers that, I think,

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.990
some of you might think about.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.700
So, I think that in looking
forward to your own careers,

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:13.530
you have to think about
the next five decades.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.630
You're going to be working --

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.260
I said this before, I think --

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.649
but you're going to be working
for another 50 years, right?

01:07:19.649 --> 01:07:22.550
More, if you enjoy it.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:26.500
With modern health care, you
might live to 100, but you

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.130
won't be working at
100, probably.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.580
You'll probably retire
by then.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.750
Maybe not.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.979
Maybe, you've got a century
ahead of you.

01:07:34.979 --> 01:07:39.060
And I think, that the world will
change a lot over this

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.439
interval of time.

01:07:40.439 --> 01:07:45.529
I think that, by the way,
information technology will be

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:48.140
changing so many things
that we do in ways

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.420
that we can't see.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.060
And financial markets
will be everywhere.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.880
So, I may be presumptuous to
think, that some of these

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:03.060
ideas here are likely to come
about, but I've come to start

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:06.220
to think, that they're all
inevitable, because we've

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.080
already seen the past. We've
seen, how financial markets

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.510
have captured more
and more risks.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.050
And we have such an advance in
our technology, that there

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:20.680
really ought to be big changes
that will come.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:30.300
So, I guess, what you have to do
is, maintain a century-long

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.680
personal outlook.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.800
I mean, just think
about how much

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.870
happened in the last century.

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:37.229
We had two world wars,
we had the whole

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.029
communism came and --

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:42.930
extreme communism came
and disappeared.

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:47.120
Things like that are going to
happen in the next century,

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:55.930
and so, I think you have to
reflect on your role as an

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:59.410
agent, not to think of it as
something that a remote

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:00.820
government is handling.

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:03.640
This is something that you
have responsibility for

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.230
helping develop, how
the world will turn

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:10.320
out in the next century.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.280
I was just saying that
governments come and go, but

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.570
financial contracts and
institutions and the people

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:21.840
who manage them continue.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.210
I think, that you face great
career risks in this new

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:26.460
environment.

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:30.860
I mentioned before, the 40
year-old, who finds that his

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:36.830
career is suddenly eliminated
because of some random change.

01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:40.660
There's evidence that, what
happens to you in life,

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.830
depends on random events.

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:46.400
It's really so much
unforecastable.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.830
I'm thinking of myself,
for example.

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.580
What did I think I
would be doing?

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.300
I'm still --

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.510
I just stayed in
the same place.

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.960
I've lived in New Haven for
almost 30 years and I've been

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.590
a college professor.

01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:59.670
But when I was your age, I never
thought that I would be

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:03.040
doing public speaking
the way I have been.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:03.640
I get --

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.965
I'm all over the --

01:10:04.965 --> 01:10:07.590
I don't mean to exaggerate,
but I didn't have the

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:08.800
confidence.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.340
You know, I was on my high
school debate team, and I

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.080
didn't particularly do well.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.580
I think you just develop --

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.900
careers develop and random
things happen, and you

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.920
discover things about
yourself.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.430
I was going to point out
studies, that show how random

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.810
events affect where you go.

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:36.750
So Joshua Angrist, who's an
economist, did a study of the

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:42.610
effect of the draft lottery on
success of people in life.

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:47.540
In 1969, during the Vietnam
War, the U.S. government

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.730
decided to use a lottery,
based on birthdates, to

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:54.410
decide, who gets drafted
into the U.S.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.890
Army and sent to Vietnam.

01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:01.850
And so, Angrist thought, that
was a good controlled

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:02.450
experiment.

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.670
Let's compare the lifetime
income of people who -- they

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.960
way they did it is, they drew
out of an urn all birthdays --

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.240
there's 366 days, birthdays --

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.805
they drew them out of an urn,
and the first one who was

01:11:14.805 --> 01:11:18.250
drawn was the first one
to go to Vietnam.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:24.220
And then, as it went down, the
higher the number, the less

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.540
likely it is that you would
ever be asked to go.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.070
And so Angrist --

01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:33.330
by the way, I got 362.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.450
I couldn't believe it.

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:37.670
What great luck.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:38.880
We were listening
on the radio --

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.520
I was a graduate student -- we
were listening on the radio

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.000
for the lottery numbers, and
we were drinking beer, and

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.220
people were all excited,
wondering who was

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.860
going to get drafted.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.210
And I thought, you know, when
it got into the 350s, 350,

01:11:55.210 --> 01:12:00.200
351, 352, I thought, I must
have missed my birthday.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.700
I can't be this far down,
but I got 362.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.030
And that's part of my success
story, because according to

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.620
Angrist, people who were
drafted, who got the low

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:13.260
number on the lottery,
ended up with

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.340
lower lifetime earnings.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.550
That kind of random event
affects your whole life.

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:24.100
You know, the word career goes
back to the sense, that there

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.800
are random things that happen,
opportunities that come, and

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.040
lack of opportunities
that hurt your life.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.510
So, I think that you have to
accept the fact, that it's a

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:47.680
risky world, that you have to
try to position yourself,

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.490
maintain --

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.220
I think -- one important piece
of advice I like to think of

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:55.610
is, maintain an orientation
toward history in the making.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:59.220
That there's a tendency for
people to orient themselves in

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.710
terms of their own life cycle.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.000
They think, what's
going on now?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.900
Well, I'm a junior at Yale, and
I'm going to be applying

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.730
to graduate school next year.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:11.810
You should be thinking, well,
this is a time in history,

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:23.035
when the Middle East is changing
rapidly, that the

01:13:23.035 --> 01:13:27.480
emerging countries are
developing new technologies,

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.110
and thinking about the
opportunities that are

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:31.520
happening in the world.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.950
That's kind of what
we got from Hank

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.110
Greenberg in his lecture.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:38.020
Remember, that he said, that
the founder of his company

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:41.960
decided to move to China at
the beginning of the 20th

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.730
century, and founded a business
because of what he

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.600
saw was happening in Shanghai,
which was an international

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.850
city at the time.

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:53.720
So, I'm going to go there, and
I'm going to make a business.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.880
That's kind of positioning
yourself with history.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.160
And then, he moved out of China
before Mao Zedong took

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.350
over, and then moved back in.

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:04.490
I mean, this is history
awareness, and I think that it

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:05.090
matters enormously.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:08.090
But you still can't completely
eliminate the role of chance

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:10.490
in your life, this is a
time-honored principle.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:12.890
I was actually going
to quote the Bible.

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.890
Ecclesiastes was a book of the
Bible written in--when was

01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:17.990
that written--around
500 BC or 600 BC.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.690
And this is, you probably
already heard this, "I

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:24.590
returned and saw under the sun
that the race is not to the

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:27.890
swift, nor the battle of the
strong, neither yet bread to

01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:31.190
the wise, nor yet riches to men
of understanding, nor yet

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.490
favor to men of skill, but time
and chance happeneth to

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:36.890
them all." So, that's a
time-honored truth, that

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:37.190
randomness--

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:40.490
I actually had this "time and
chance happeneth to them all,"

01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:43.190
I actually had that inscribed
in Latin when I

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.390
had my office redone.

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:47.990
It's over my desk in my office
at home, "tempus casumque in

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.290
omnibus." Chance plays a huge
role in our lives and this

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:54.290
risky world plays a sequence of
events over your lifetime

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.390
that we have to try to manage.

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:59.090
So, what I hoped to
do in this course.

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:02.390
This was really a course about
managing risks as well as

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:04.190
enterprise and creating
a cooperative spirit.

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:08.090
I wanted to try to convey to you
that we have a technology

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:11.090
for that, that should be
a part of your life.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.290
All right, thank you.

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:13.540
[APPLAUSE]

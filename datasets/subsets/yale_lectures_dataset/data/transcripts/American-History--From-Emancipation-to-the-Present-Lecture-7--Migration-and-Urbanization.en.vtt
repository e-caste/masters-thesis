00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.800
I want to start with a poem,
play the audio of it for you.&nbsp;

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.167
You should listen--you
should be able to hear it

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:26.667
pretty--pretty well.&nbsp; The
poem is called Old Lem

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:33.900
by a man named Sterling Brown,
one of the great poets in

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.500
American letters in the
twentieth century.&nbsp; He

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.700
writes the poem
after--you know,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.500
we're talking this week
about the first decade and a

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000
half or so of the twentieth
century.&nbsp; This poem was

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.300
written after that,
written I think in the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
nineteen--late twenties or
early thirties.&nbsp; I don't

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.700
remember off the top of my
head.&nbsp; But it speaks to the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600
experiences, the rural
experiences and the social

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.667
and political experiences
of African Americans.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.700
&nbsp;And it certainly is, as
you'll hear in the poem,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.300
it gives you sort of a
context behind why people

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.067
might not want to
stay in the South.

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.400
The poem is
called--called Old Lem.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.167
Old Lem - "I talked to
old Lem and old Lem said:

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:25.400
They weigh the cotton
They store the corn

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.300
We only good enough
To work the rows;

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.300
They run the commissary
They keep the books, We gotta be

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.467
grateful,  For being cheated;
Whippersnapper clerks

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:41.700
Call us out of our name, We got
to say mister, To spindling boys

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.200
They make our figgers,
Turn somersets,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
We buck in the middle,
Say, 'Thankyuh, sah.' 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.000
They don't come by ones,
They don't come by twos

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.900
But they come by tens.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.200
They got the judges,
They got the lawyers

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.500
They got the jury-rolls
They got the law

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.767
They don't come by ones
They got the sheriffs

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:11.900
They got the deputies
They don't come by twos

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.767
They got the shotguns
They got the rope

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.800
We git the justice in the end
And they come by tens.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.000
Their fists stay closed
Their eyes look straight

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.600
Our hands stay open 
Our eyes must fall

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
They don't come by ones 
They got the manhood

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.067
They got the courage
They don't come by twos

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.300
We got to slink around 
Hangtailed hounds.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.600
They burn us when we dogs 
They burn us when we men

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.100
They come by tens...
I had a buddy

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.567
Six foot of man 
Muscled up perfect

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:54.100
Game to the heart 
They don't come by ones

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.100
Outworked and outfought 
Any man or two men

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.800
They don't come by twos 
He spoke out of turn 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.200
At the commissary 
They gave him a day 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
To git out the county 
He didn't take it.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.400
He said 'Come and get me.'
They came and got him

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.667
And they came by tens. 
He stayed in the county-- 

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:17.700
He lays there dead.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.300
They don't come by ones 
They don't come by twos 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.567
But they come by tens."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.267
Again, that's
Sterling Brown,

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:36.000
poem named Old Lem, talking
about forms of southern

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.500
justice.&nbsp; If you dare to
speak back to somebody,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.700
if you're black and spoke
back to somebody who was

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.567
white, they might come after
you.&nbsp; They would not come by

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:52.500
ones or twos; they'd come by
tens.&nbsp; What I want to talk

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.100
about today, having set that
really uplifting context for

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.800
the day's lecture, is talk
about the Great Migration

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.600
and take us forward into the
1910s with the film called

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.900
The Birth of a Nation.&nbsp;
Essentially what I want to

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.900
do in today's lecture is
look at the beginning of a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.967
fundamental shift in
demographics of black

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.200
America in--as far as
geography's concerned.&nbsp;

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.500
Black America is still
overwhelmingly a rural

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.500
population, and is
overwhelming--overwhelmingly

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.700
southern.&nbsp; That begins to
change and change rather

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.567
quickly during the Great
Migration.&nbsp; Now I ended last

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:53.200
week's lecture talking about
the founding of the NAACP,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.867
1909.&nbsp; And I
want to point out,

00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:58.867
the NAACP is not--was
not the only organization

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:01.967
founded at that--at this
time that focused on the

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:05.900
quality of black life.&nbsp;
Another such organization

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.267
was the Young Men's
Christian Association,

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:11.767
and the Young Women's
Christian Association.&nbsp; Both

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:15.400
groups are
highly segregated,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.700
but they still played in--a
central role in making space

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.500
available for
blacks, particularly black

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.167
travelers.&nbsp;
Housing was provided,

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:25.000
hot meals would be provided,
community organizing.&nbsp; These

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.500
become sites of
community organizing,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.800
much like black
churches were playing,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.000
still to this day of course,
but before that.&nbsp; In fact,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.300
with the YMCA, I was on
an internship right after

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.267
college and the internship
leader--this is 1989,

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:42.567
1990--the internship leader
was talking about when he

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:43.667
was coming through L.A.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:47.900
in the 1960s, traveling
there for the first time,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.500
every black man knew that he
had to go to the YMCA if he

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.067
wanted to find a place to
stay.&nbsp; So this is not just

00:05:54.067 --> 00:06:00.367
the history of 1900s and the
1910s and teens.&nbsp; It goes

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:02.867
forward all the way
and through really the

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:04.900
systematic
desegregation of society,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.567
or at least sort of
structurally in the 1960s

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:12.167
and seventies.&nbsp; Anyway,
aside from the NAACP,

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:14.300
and in addition to the Young
Men's and Young Women's

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.500
Christian Associations,
you have one of the most

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.900
important betterment
organizations being founded

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.500
in this area, and that's
the National Urban League,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.367
founded in 1911.&nbsp; Now
whereas the NAACP dedicated

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:32.800
itself to a legal and
intellectual strategy,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.000
trying to find ways to
seek justice for African

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.300
Americans through legal
means and through the idea

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.400
of sort of civilizing,
uplifting society,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.700
through the Talented
Tenth, the Urban League was

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.700
explicitly
concerned with labor,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.767
finding jobs for blacks,
sometimes at any cost.&nbsp; The

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.500
Urban League was chiefly
concerned with finding jobs

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.600
for blacks who were newly
arrived to urban northern

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.200
centers.&nbsp; The
Urban League was,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.600
from the start, less radical
than the NAACP.&nbsp; Now to even

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.167
think of the phrase NAACP
and radical going together

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:12.467
may sound strange, but it
really was sort of an avant

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:15.700
garde organization in many
ways at its founding.&nbsp; Urban

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.367
League wasn't in that
regard.&nbsp; Some will claim,

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.300
as you'll see later on, that
the Urban League was really

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.000
quite the opposite, a
conservative force in the

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.700
back pocket of
corporate interests,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.267
and willing to bust unions
in order to put blacks into

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:33.500
jobs of any kind.&nbsp; Now the
issue of jobs here can't be

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.600
overemphasized.&nbsp; Jobs are
important in any era to any

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.600
people, of course, but when
you have a large segment of

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.500
the population, of a
socially identified

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.667
population, black
folks in this case,

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:50.567
in great flux, jobs become
that much more critical.&nbsp;

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:55.000
Blacks were that
population.&nbsp; They were in

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.900
profound flux in the first
decades of the twentieth

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.667
century, and it is
their mass migration,

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:04.100
what is referred to in this
era as the Great Migration,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.600
and the events
that surround that,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.567
that form the basis of this
week's lectures.&nbsp; Now I want

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:14.300
to start with just a
clarification of the title,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.100
the name of this phenomenon,
the Great Migration.&nbsp; At

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.367
this moment in time, roughly
early years of the twentieth

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:24.567
century to roughly the
start of World War I,

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:29.100
this was the greatest
internal migration of a

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.000
people in U.S.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.300
history.&nbsp; However, and we'll
get to it in a couple of

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.000
weeks, the migration of
African Americans in the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.100
1940s and early fifties way
outstrips the migration I'm

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.600
talking about now but
the--in terms of number.&nbsp;

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.367
But the naming is--the
naming convention is such

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:49.000
that this early period of
migration is called the

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.900
Great Migration, just to be
clear about that fact.&nbsp; Now

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.100
aside from
naming conventions,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.867
I want you to also realize
that when I think of the

00:08:58.867 --> 00:09:01.200
Great Migration, I think
of--I think that it needs to

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.400
be understood as a
political movement,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.867
that migration itself was
a political act.&nbsp; Was it

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.700
organized in the ways that
we think of in terms of high

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.967
politics or even grassroots
protest movements?&nbsp; No,

00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:18.667
it wasn't.&nbsp; It wasn't.&nbsp; But
it was profoundly political

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:21.767
and I wanted to delineate
those reasons over the next

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:24.467
little bit.

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.867
It's important to
first start to look at the

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:29.300
southern black situation at
the turn of the century.&nbsp;

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.600
That's why I played
that clip for you,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.567
to get a, sort of a
sense, at least artistically

00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:37.800
rendered, of the stakes, of
the narrow room within which

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.600
African Americans could
move and move safely in the

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.600
South.&nbsp; Blacks who had the
option of staying in the

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.800
South left during the Great
Migration because all the

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.100
political privileges that
they had enjoyed during

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.967
Reconstruction had been
systematically stripped

00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.700
away.&nbsp; And I've been talking
about this the last couple

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.000
of weeks.&nbsp; Blacks who had
the resources to leave,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.200
and that's a big issue, if
they had the actual means to

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.767
get out of town, they might
have left just for the fact

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:12.500
that, you know, any hope of
their having the right to

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.500
vote and all the other
political benefits that come

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.600
along with that just
weren't in the mix any more,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.600
not after Redemption,
not after the systematic

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.900
stripping away of the black
voting presence.&nbsp; The men

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.000
couldn't vote any longer.&nbsp;
State funded education for

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.567
blacks was functionally
nonexistent.&nbsp; Social

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:39.600
segregation was only
increasing and there of

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.700
course was always the
looming threat of lynch

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.267
law.&nbsp; So lacking even the
most basic political rights,

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:54.067
some blacks just up and
left.&nbsp; Black farmers might

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:59.000
have left simply because of
the sharecropping system,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.800
something else alluded to
in this poem by Sterling

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.300
Brown.&nbsp; Sharecropping,
as you already know,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.200
a form of employment that
looked all too much like

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.400
slavery.&nbsp; It was a dead
end.&nbsp; Better opportunities,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.267
the bedrock of any sort
of political philosophy,

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:19.900
awaited black
sharecroppers in the north;

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.100
at least, this was the
thinking.&nbsp; So you have the

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.267
combination of,
maybe a little dramatic,

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:35.100
political death in the South
as an option.&nbsp; That's not

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.467
very viable, so blacks might
want to leave.&nbsp; An economic

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:40.467
system that's determined to
keep them in second-class

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:43.967
citizenship status.&nbsp; So we
think of--of the forces in

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:46.567
the South that,
or the reality,

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:49.900
the daily lived reality on
the ground in the South,

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.067
you can see that just the
determination to leave,

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:55.600
to get out, was a response
to the political and

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.600
economic
situation.&nbsp; And in that way,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.867
the decision, I think,
is--can be rendered as sort

00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:07.200
of a political decision.&nbsp;
And it's interesting if you

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.567
think about it,
sticking on this issue of,

00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:10.300
you know, the
politics of the situation,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.167
it's interesting to
think about how whites

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:16.500
reacted--southern whites
reacted to black exodus.&nbsp; At

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.367
first, in some
reg--in some regions,

00:12:19.367 --> 00:12:21.900
whites were thrilled.&nbsp;
"We can finally get the

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.000
so-called negro
problem"--this was a popular

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.100
phrase of the age--"the
negro problem would leave

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.667
once blacks left town."&nbsp;
But rather quickly they

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:34.567
realized, "Wait a second.&nbsp;
This is our bedrock labor

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:38.267
force.&nbsp; This is the force
that keeps whites--poor

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:40.967
whites placated, because at
least they're not black."&nbsp;

00:12:40.967 --> 00:12:45.300
The social order was based
on color caste and it was

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.200
being destroyed by black
ex--exodus.&nbsp; So whites begin

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.867
to threaten blacks if
they make plans to leave.

00:12:51.867 --> 00:12:53.700
It sounds
completely nonsensical,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.600
but this is just the state
of the case.&nbsp; And there were

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.967
white northerners coming
down who were labor agents,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.167
and white municipalities
start charging these labor

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:07.300
agencies--I'll explain
more about them in a

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.800
second--exorbitant fees
to register to try to get

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.900
blacks out.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.600
It doesn't matter.&nbsp; Labor
agents have the resource.&nbsp;

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.000
Southern whites
started seeing their

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.600
socio--socioeconomic
political system,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.167
the foundation upon which
so much of it was built,

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:32.000
starting to crumble
with black exodus.&nbsp; Now

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.200
historians talk about push,
when it comes to the Great

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.600
Migration, push-pull
factors.&nbsp; There's debate

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.600
whether that's a useful
model or not.&nbsp; I'm not going

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.300
to worry about,
sort of, that debate,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.000
but I am going to talk
about a series of different

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.200
factors that were at play,
that really combine in such

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.500
a way that make this
migration so powerful,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.200
so large.&nbsp; You
have an infestation,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
is one of the ways that
makes this migration so

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.400
important, the boll weevil.&nbsp;
A little pest that comes up

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.100
from Mexico, sweeps across
Texas and into southeastern

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.500
U.S.&nbsp; The boll weevil is a
little bug that gets into

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500
the boll.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.600
cotton boll, B-O-L-L, and
destroys it.&nbsp; Cotton wasn't

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.800
the only crop in the South,
but it was the main crop.&nbsp;

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.700
It was so much of the
bedrock of the southern

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.300
economy was in that
agricultural product.&nbsp;

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.500
Cotton crops get destroyed.&nbsp;
There's no work for blacks.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.500
They're working the farms.&nbsp;
If you can't find work,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.800
what's the point of staying
around?&nbsp; I already mentioned

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.500
political disfranchisement.&nbsp;
This job scarcity in the

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:56.200
South is also an
economic--and the South is

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.000
essentially an economic
colony of the North,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.700
and then the North has
a decreasing supply of

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.767
immigrant labor, as you move
forward into the twentieth

00:15:02.767 --> 00:15:08.767
century, as a result of
state conflict in European

00:15:08.767 --> 00:15:13.600
theaters, heading towards
World War I.&nbsp; Just take

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.067
these things together,
there's a decreasing reason

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:18.100
to stay in the South and the
lure of jobs in the North.&nbsp;

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:29.000
Assisting this, or abetting
this process even more,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.500
are the individuals
I mentioned before,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.667
labor agents.&nbsp; These are
essentially job recruiters

00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:38.700
employed by people who
own factories and mills,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.300
mines in the
Midwest and the North,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.300
who would travel South,
since the labor supply was

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.900
drying up in the North and
come into a town--and I'm

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.967
making up the numbers
here--come into a town where

00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:54.300
there's a, you know, a lot
of blacks looking for work

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.700
and say, "Look, in the North
you can own your own house

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.400
or an
apartment.&nbsp; You can vote,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.167
sit where you want to on the
bus.&nbsp; We've got a job here.&nbsp;

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.400
The job's going to pay
you three dollars a day,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.400
 unheard of amounts of
money.&nbsp; Being able to own

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.367
property or at least rent
property where you want to

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:15.600
and ride on the bus,
sit where you want to,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.767
unheard of possibilities in
the South.&nbsp; And they go well

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:21.600
we--They said, "Well, we
can't afford the train fare

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.767
to get up to, say Chicago or
Cincinnati or Cleveland."&nbsp;

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:27.900
He says, "Don't worry
about it.&nbsp; I'll pay for it,

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.800
and you can
work it off."&nbsp; Or,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.300
"Don't even worry about it.&nbsp;
I'll just pay for it."&nbsp; So

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.300
labor agents are coming down
and signing up a black labor

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.800
force to come to
work in the mines,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.000
and factories, and
mills.&nbsp; You have,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.300
of course, informal
lines of communication,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.000
people who make, you know
that first person to make

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the trip up to
Chicago and saying,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.100
"My god, I am making
three dollars a day,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.900
and I have my
own apartment,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.000
 and writing letters back,
or saving up a lot of money

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.367
and driving down, you know,
at the end of the year in

00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:07.600
their own car, dressed in
their fanciest clothes.&nbsp;

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.800
Talk about the,
sort of the quote,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.600
"land of milk and honey"
up North.&nbsp; This certainly

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.800
inspired others to travel.&nbsp;
And then you have a very

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.600
important newspaper,
the Chicago Defender,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.200
the most important black
newspaper of the time.&nbsp;

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.800
Chicago Defender, of
course based in Chicago,

00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:33.000
but circulated heavily
throughout the South.&nbsp; Bags

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.900
of the Chicago Defender
would be bundled up,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.700
thrown on trains, and
they would appear in say

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.567
Montgomery or
Huntsville or, you know,

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:44.700
other southern towns.&nbsp; And
they'd be read by who knows

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.367
how many people.&nbsp; Now the
Defender made it almost a

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:51.300
sport talking about
lynchings happening in the

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.300
South.&nbsp; Most often they were
about true events.&nbsp; It was

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.600
an--this was an era of
newspapers where you just,

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.700
you know, made stuff up
still.&nbsp; So most often

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.600
talking about true events
in the South and horrible

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.800
events.&nbsp; And there'd be
letters to the editor,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.200
sometimes true,
often fabricated,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.600
but still they were
there, written by blacks,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.500
written in dialect,
but talking about the

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.267
opportunities in the North
and--and reminding folks of

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:24.300
the degradation
in the South.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.300
Chicago Defender's
incredibly important as a

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.400
tool to help people
find the courage,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.100
or find the resources, or
the determination to move

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.400
north.&nbsp; And then you
have service organizations,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.900
like the
National Urban League,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.200
founded in 1911, dedicated
to improving the quality of

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.867
life or life chances for
blacks migrating North.&nbsp; So

00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:55.000
you have, just in
the first two decades,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
sort of an astonishing
convergence of all these

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.600
different forces that really
help fuel this migration.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.700
And the numbers are
really quite striking.&nbsp; Just

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.900
between--this is just to get
a sense of things.&nbsp; You're

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.000
not going to have to know
this for the--for the like

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.200
an exam or anything.&nbsp;
But looking at a few major

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.067
northern cities, between
1910 and 1920--it's so funny

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:22.300
when I say you don't have
to know this for the exam,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.400
the tapping stops.&nbsp;
That's hysterical.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.100
you take New
York City, in 1910,

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.800
the population--the African
American population is

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.900
around ninety
thousand.&nbsp; Within ten years,

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.600
it's one hundred
and fifty thousand,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.167
an increase of sixty-six
percent.&nbsp; In Chicago,

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:40.067
the population increases by
one hundred and--almost one

00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:44.000
hundred and fifty percent
from forty-four thousand to

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.500
one hundred and ten
thousand.&nbsp; In Cleveland,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.867
population soars from eight
thousand to thirty-four

00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:52.600
thousand, an increase of
three hundred percent.&nbsp; And

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.000
in Detroit, the population
goes from five thousand to

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.200
forty thousand,&nbsp;
population--an increase of

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.500
six hundred percent.&nbsp; So
radical changes in just a

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:07.067
ten-year period of time.&nbsp;
This is the era when Harlem

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:12.667
becomes known as a
black enclave.&nbsp; Now,

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:15.000
so we know what was getting
people out of the South.&nbsp;

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.900
What did they find when they
got to the North?&nbsp; Yeah,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.300
they could have
their own apartments,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.300
certainly.&nbsp; Owning homes
would take a little while

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.400
for most migrants, but
they would find segregated

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.500
housing, de
facto.&nbsp; Not de jure,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:37.167
de facto.&nbsp; And segregated
housing was bad housing,

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:41.000
low quality,
poorly maintained,

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.800
sites of high
levels of crime,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.567
vice, public health
hazards.&nbsp; Anybody know

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.500
Washington, D.C., that well,
sort of the area?&nbsp; Well

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.300
Georgetown used
to be, you know,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.100
a sort of slum
in--in the docks,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.600
but getting around say
Dupont Circle and heading

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.000
that area, a lot of
townhouses around there,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
row houses.&nbsp; And
where I'm talking about,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.367
you would go behind the row
houses to the interior of

00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:13.300
the block and these
alley dwellings.&nbsp; I mean

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.400
pestilence, horrible
sights, horrible locations.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400
This is where a lot of
migrant blacks lived in the

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.900
alleys in Washington, D.C.,
sort of the invisible to the

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.700
public, but certainly
there.&nbsp; Migrants to the

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.267
North would find
native black resistance,

00:21:28.267 --> 00:21:31.800
people who'd been there
already for generations who

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.100
thought these black
migrants talked funny,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.867
dressed strangely, cooked
food that smelled wrong,

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:44.600
and were loud and boisterous
and acted out in public.&nbsp;

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.900
All these kind of racially
coded things we certainly

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.000
still live with, but
you have long-term black

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.400
communities deeply unhappy
about these migrants coming

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.900
up.&nbsp; You'd have people who
had migrated just ten years

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.700
earlier unhappy
about the new migrants,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.300
because "they're just
making--they're embarrassing

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.067
us, they're
making increasing job

00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:08.300
competition."&nbsp; Coming
up was--was filled with

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.300
challenges.&nbsp; You
would also have,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.300
you know, an Urban League
trying to find people jobs.&nbsp;

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.700
You would have African
Americans being brought up

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:26.900
to a factory
where a labor union,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.767
which blacks
weren't allowed to join,

00:22:32.767 --> 00:22:36.600
and the union
being on strike,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.900
and the Urban League working
with the company that owns

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.867
the factory saying--the
factory owner saying,

00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:47.000
"Look, if you can get me one
hundred black men to work in

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.800
the factory, that would
be great.&nbsp; I'll give them

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.100
jobs."&nbsp; Well, they're
hired as scab labor,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.200
so they are vilified by
white labor workers.&nbsp; It's a

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.900
job, certainly, as long as
the labor union stays on

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.067
strike.&nbsp; But it's a job at
some pretty serious costs,

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:04.900
as we'll see in this week's
readings and in Wednesday's

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:10.900
lecture.&nbsp; So life wasn't
easy and you have to think

00:23:15.067 --> 00:23:20.200
about this tension
between, sort of,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.100
black autonomy, the real
power in being able to make

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.367
a decision to leave town.&nbsp;
You can't discount that.&nbsp;

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:31.967
That's important; sort of
life changing in a sense,

00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:35.600
just to get up and go.&nbsp; You
have to weigh that against

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.867
the reality of like
life when you got to your

00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:42.000
destination might be pretty
horrible as well.&nbsp; Certainly

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.400
different than anything
you expected.&nbsp; Yeah,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.500
you got paid more, yeah, you
had your own roof over your

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.600
head, but the tenements in
which blacks were living

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:58.200
were just, I mean,
horrible.&nbsp; I mean the stuff

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.300
beyond your imagination
in so many ways.&nbsp; Sure,

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:06.000
you could ride where
you wanted to on the bus,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.500
but there are still costs
or risks involved in acting

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.467
out, shall we say.&nbsp; Again,
we'll see more of this in

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:18.900
the next lect--in the next
lecture.&nbsp; Now one thing I--I

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:26.200
also want to make clear
before moving into the next

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.400
phase of the lecture
is thinking about,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.300
as we're trying to unpack
what migration really was,

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.800
it's important to realize
that migration wasn't just

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.600
blacks working on
the southern farms,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.867
all of a sudden, you
know, in a week's time,

00:24:43.867 --> 00:24:47.167
they're working in a
mill in Chicago.&nbsp; No,

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:50.300
it wasn't that.&nbsp; I
mean migration was,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.700
among many things, at
least--I mean it was at

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.000
least very complicated.&nbsp; So
you might have some working

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.067
in the farm.&nbsp; The
boll weevil attacks;

00:24:58.067 --> 00:25:00.800
there's no more opportunity
to work.&nbsp; You'd--you'd go to

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.467
the city, a southern
city, trying to find a job,

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:07.700
something.&nbsp; Cities became
crowded.&nbsp; This is where

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.100
labor agents would
really st--quote,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.100
"steal."

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.900
You would find a
lot of people,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.400
hire them up to the North.&nbsp;
But would they always go all

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.200
the--all, quote, "all the
way" to north to Chicago or

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.867
New York City?&nbsp; No, they
wouldn't.&nbsp; They might end up

00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:25.300
in the coalfields
in West Virginia,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.667
or in Ohio, or in Kentucky.&nbsp;
And they might work there

00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:33.867
for, you know, six months
and then go back home to

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:37.600
Montgomery, just pick a
place.&nbsp; And then they might

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.500
leave the next year for
three months and then come

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.400
back.&nbsp; Migration was not
literally from field to

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.667
factory in one straight
direction.&nbsp; People were

00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:48.500
going back and forth often.&nbsp;
They might get up to,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.400
you know, the mines--the
coalmines in Kentucky,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.067
be there for a couple years
and then make it to Chicago

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:58.500
after that, and who knows
how long they would stay?&nbsp;

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.500
So you need to understand
that--that--that migration

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.100
is doing--moving in many
different directions at

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.100
once, although it was
generally from field to

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:12.100
generally to factory.&nbsp; One
thing that's not ambiguous

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.400
at all during this
era is what I'll say,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.400
the commerce of
racism.&nbsp; Remember,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.500
whites didn't want to
have blacks leave--or whites

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.667
wanted blacks to
leave at first,

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:33.000
then realized, "Wait, this
would mess up our system,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.167
 then don't want blacks
to leave at all.&nbsp; Yet they

00:26:36.167 --> 00:26:42.000
still treat blacks pretty
shabbily in their southern

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.200
towns and in their southern
fields.&nbsp; One thing that is

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.467
incumbent upon this sort
of commerce of racism is

00:26:55.467 --> 00:26:59.400
control.&nbsp; Who's in control
of society?&nbsp; It's a word

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:06.067
I've used before.&nbsp; And
society becomes destabilized

00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:08.967
by blacks moving on their
own or with the help of

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:14.300
labor agents, you start
seeing a real rise in white

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.400
resistance to the challenge
to this system.&nbsp; White

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.400
resistance to black autonomy
becomes palpable.&nbsp; I already

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.000
mentioned southern
resistance to labor agents

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.767
coming down.&nbsp; It's important
to understand there are

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:41.300
other things that were
developing within white

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.167
America--white southern
America that complicated the

00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:46.900
nature of black-white
relations in the South,

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.667
and that--the most
important force is the Klan,

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:51.900
the KKK.&nbsp; Now the
Klan, you'll remember,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.967
was destroyed at the
national level during

00:27:54.967 --> 00:27:58.667
Reconstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
starts to creep back during

00:27:58.667 --> 00:28:00.900
Redemption, but
it's really, you know,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.200
as terrible--terrifying
as it is,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.500
something happens when you
get to around the height of

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.500
the migration, around 1915.&nbsp;
The popularity of the Klan

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.200
skyrockets, I mean
skyrockets.&nbsp; The fact that

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.300
it's happening at the same
time blacks are trying to

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.800
leave the South,
in a real outflow,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.500
is no coincidence.&nbsp; There's
no doubt also that a large

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.967
part of the
Klan's popularity,

00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:38.700
reborn
popularity, is a film,

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.700
D.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.700
W.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.567
Griffith's film called The
Birth of a Nation.&nbsp; This

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:45.900
movie is based on a
novel by a guy named Thomas

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.600
Dixon--Dixon, a novel called
The Clansman.&nbsp; The book as

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.700
well as the movie, and I'll
only be talking about the

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.600
movie, is a
depiction of Reconstruction,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.200
but from a point of
view that was entirely

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.400
sympathetic to the
southern community,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.167
southern mentality.&nbsp;
The film was immediately

00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:06.167
controversial.

00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:10.300
It was explicitly racist,
but there's no denying the

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.700
fact that it
was cinematically

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.267
revolutionary.&nbsp; Let's cast
inside the subject matter

00:29:16.267 --> 00:29:19.267
for a moment.&nbsp; It may be
the most important film,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.600
most important
American film of all time,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.800
for the way it changed
what was possible from a

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.900
technical point of view.&nbsp; We
have large outdoor scenes,

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.100
the tracking shot,
cat's eye lenses,

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.800
fade-ins, color, or
more like tinting,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.767
but still color,
night photography,

00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:39.667
panning, close ups,
high angle shots,

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:42.700
and so forth.&nbsp; It was also
the first feature-length

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.100
film in American
motion picture history.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.800
So technically, it's an
astonishing accomplishment.&nbsp;

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.000
When it's shown at
the White House,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.567
Woodrow Wilson, southern
Democrat but also a scholar

00:29:59.567 --> 00:30:02.100
of some merit,
declared that it was,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.400
quote, "history written in
lightning."&nbsp; He lauded it

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.267
for its bold and accurate
depiction of the past.&nbsp; Now

00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:14.067
for the record, its only
accuracy came in the fact

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:17.500
that it represented a type
of hysterical psychology

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.467
that captivated southerners
who felt that they were

00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:26.300
victims of a war of northern
aggression.&nbsp; So Woodrow

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.367
Wilson
celebrates this thing,

00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:29.600
this is, you know, this is
an incredible historical

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.100
document.&nbsp; It is an
incredible historical

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.200
document, but not for what
it shows on this--not for

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.067
the story it tells, but for
how it captures a mentality

00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:45.267
in the nineteen-teens, and
how it excites a populist,

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:49.600
I guess, I guess a populist
base in white America and

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:55.600
helps elevate membership
numbers in the Klan.&nbsp; I mean

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.667
the film is hailed--and
speaking of two sides,

00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:00.700
from the
technical standpoint,

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.400
Spike Lee, ever the
controversial artist,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.300
talked about it as the most
important film that he's

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.100
ever--I mean it was so--the
most important film for

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.400
him.&nbsp; On the
other side of it,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.400
in terms of, you know, what
the film was really about,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.567
it's still used by the Klan
today as a recruiting tool.&nbsp;

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:20.600
So it's not just this
interesting silent movie

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:28.500
from the 1910s.&nbsp; It's still
being used today.&nbsp; Now the

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.000
basic storyline tracks the
rise and fall of the South,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.700
as told through the
experiences of two different

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.300
families.&nbsp; You have a family
called the Stoneman-- the

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.367
Stoneman family
from the North,

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:43.000
and the Cameron family
from the South.&nbsp; So lifelong

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.500
friends, both very
powerful families,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.600
but divided by the
Mason-Dixon line.&nbsp; A little

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.767
bit of Romeo and
Juliet to the story,

00:31:52.767 --> 00:31:54.700
in that the different
sets of Stoneman and Cameron

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.800
children are in love with
each other.&nbsp; So the love

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.800
crosses the--the Northern
and South divide.&nbsp; And so

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.100
the Stonemans and Camerons
stand in as metaphors for

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.500
the entire North-South
division.&nbsp; These are

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.600
divisions that--these are
parts of the country that

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.367
should love each other.&nbsp;
They are in one spirit in

00:32:13.367 --> 00:32:15.800
some way, but there's a
fundamental rupture and we

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.600
need to solve that rupture.&nbsp;
So the premise is that the

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.367
Camerons, these
are the southerners,

00:32:24.367 --> 00:32:27.167
give three sons to the
war.&nbsp; Only one survives,

00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:32.400
a guy named Ben, who
then avows--vows to avenge

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.600
southern dishonor, but he
also happens to fall in love

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.200
with--this makes it
complicated--one of the

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.500
Stoneman daughters, northern
daughter.&nbsp; So the sole

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.367
surviving southern male of
the Cameron clan falls in

00:32:47.367 --> 00:32:51.067
love with the Stonemans'
daughter.&nbsp; On the northern

00:32:51.067 --> 00:32:55.000
side, the Stonemans
lose one son to the war,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.900
and the other son remains in
love with the Cameron girl,

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:04.700
so you see this
crossing.&nbsp; After the war,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.900
Austin Stoneman, the family
patriarch and member of

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.700
Congress, comes down South
and puts the power hungry

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.867
and corrupt Silas
Lynch--that's his name.&nbsp;

00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:16.500
It's not a subtle film
in any stretch of the

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.767
imagination--Silas Lynch
happens to be of mixed race,

00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:25.000
but has a particular craving
for white women.&nbsp; He puts

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.100
Silas Lynch in charge of
the liberated slaves in the

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.100
Camerons' home
town of Piedmont,

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.167
and the Piedmont blacks, now
having the right to vote,

00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:35.600
raise all sorts of trouble
for the local whites,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.500
and especially
affected were the Camerons,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.667
these southerners.&nbsp; The
film tracks this history,

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:44.967
the rise of
Reconstruction governments,

00:33:44.967 --> 00:33:48.767
run by unprepared and
unqualified blacks.&nbsp; It

00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:51.567
depicts blacks' social and
political intransigence and

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:53.300
the systematic
disenfranchisement of

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.100
southern whites.&nbsp; And Birth
of a Nation also gives us a

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.600
cautionary tale of what
happens when black men are

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.767
freed and find themselves
around white women.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:10.367
see this most clearly
in the actions of Gus,

00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:13.900
a properly mannered servant
for the Camerons prior to

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.367
emancipation, who becomes
a leering threat with the

00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:22.900
conclusion of the Civil
War.&nbsp; Despite Ben Stoneman,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.800
the surviving young man in
the southern family in the

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.967
Civil War--despite Ben
Stoneman's warnings to Gus

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:30.867
to leave his family alone
and despite Ben's warning to

00:34:30.867 --> 00:34:32.800
his younger sister Flora to
stay in the house and thus

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.300
remain safe, tragedy
strikes.&nbsp; Gus stalks Flora

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.300
when she leaves the home to
get water from a stream in

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.800
the woods.&nbsp; Flora sees Gus
stalking her and runs for

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.800
her life, knowing--and this
is all very clearly implied

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.500
in the film--that
if Gus caught her,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.600
she would be raped.&nbsp; Flora
finds herself at a cliff's

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.100
edge, while
calling for help,

00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:01.467
as Gus--Gus inches closer.&nbsp;
She avoids certain rape by

00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:08.800
leaping to her death.&nbsp; She
dies in her brother's arms,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.600
and Ben, already determined
to restore the South's

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.700
honor, goes after Gus.&nbsp; It
will come to no surprise to

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.267
you, I think, that Gus is
lynched.&nbsp; The castration

00:35:18.267 --> 00:35:20.200
scenes in the film were
actually cut in the final

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.867
print.&nbsp; And Ben, already
inspired about how to create

00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:28.367
a gang of southerners to
avenge the South's honor,

00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:31.167
organizes the Klan in an--in
an explicit move to social

00:35:31.167 --> 00:35:34.100
control, the protection of
white womanhood and--and the

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.400
Redemption of the South.&nbsp;
Now the story isn't just

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.600
about the tangled love
relationship that spans the

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.100
Civil War.&nbsp; It's also about
representation of blacks and

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.800
their quest for full
citizenship rights and the

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.800
real object that
defined that quest,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.200
which was the white woman.&nbsp;
It's also a story about

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.900
romanticizing and justifying
the rise of the Klan,

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.600
the role in the salvation
of white womanhood and

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.500
therefore southern dignity.&nbsp;
Now spliced together,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.300
I was doing--giving you all
this background so you'll

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.000
make sense of what you're
about to see.&nbsp; I spliced

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.200
together three different
scenes from the movie to

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.600
help you get a better
understanding of what's at

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.300
stake here.&nbsp; You should not
look at the movie--the film

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.267
so much for its
interpretation of the fall

00:36:17.267 --> 00:36:18.267
and rise of the South.

00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:22.367
That is patently false.&nbsp;
What's worth thinking about

00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:25.367
is the particular
interpretation of blackness,

00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.667
of dignity, of citizenship,
of intelligence,

00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:31.800
objectification, etcetera.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.067
How they all became an
object of fascination when

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:39.300
it was released.&nbsp; The
movie was a runaway hit,

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.367
played to sold-out audiences
around the country,

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:43.000
even though it charged
what was then the exorbitant

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.800
price of seventy-five cents
to two dollars a ticket to

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800
get in.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.800
This is the Stoneman family
coming down to the South to

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.500
recuperate from bad health,
and the Stoneman and the

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.000
Cameron children
see each other,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.700
greet each other.&nbsp; And yes,
they're in black face when

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.700
they are appearing black.&nbsp;
That's Ben Cameron on the

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.600
right, with his love in
the middle and his sister,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.367
the young one
who kills herself,

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:42.367
on the left.&nbsp; That's the
first clip.&nbsp; I don't--I

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.500
confess, I don't
know what happened.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.500
I was playing
it this morning,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.200
getting it ready, and
there's no sound for this.&nbsp;

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.800
So it's just--it's
just music playing in the

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.400
background.&nbsp;
Down here it says,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.267
"an historical facsimile
at the State House of

00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:21.700
Representatives of South
Carolina as it was in 1870,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:27.300
after a photograph by the
Columbia State."&nbsp; Basically,

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.400
blacks are now in control
and this is what happens.&nbsp;

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.767
You'll see the fade in.

00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:38.467
This has technically never
been done before.&nbsp; You'll

00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:41.467
have a mix of characters
here in black face and

00:39:41.467 --> 00:39:47.467
actually black actors.&nbsp; A
depiction of the morality of

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.667
black representatives,
drinking on the floor,

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:11.267
eating either a turkey
leg or a large chicken leg,

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:21.100
not knowing how to comport
themselves.&nbsp; You know,

00:40:45.367 --> 00:40:47.300
these are the things
that are important to black

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:53.667
representatives.&nbsp; Whites
have to salute.&nbsp; There's

00:40:53.667 --> 00:41:00.000
general chaos.&nbsp; They're not
properly behaved.&nbsp; But there

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.800
are some representatives,
and you can see them there,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.800
sitting there quietly.&nbsp;
The close in shot like that,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.800
again, brand new.&nbsp; Blacks
and whites in the gallery.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.600
You start seeing here a
depiction of what the actual

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.100
desire of black
representatives happens to

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:32.100
be, and their reaction.&nbsp;
That's Silas Lynch in the

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.900
middle, and at the bottom
of the screen there for a

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:10.500
second you saw him.&nbsp; A mixed
race man that's come down to

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.800
take control of the South.&nbsp;
And this final clip right

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.800
here.&nbsp; His
sister's already died,

00:42:24.267 --> 00:42:30.267
died in his arms.&nbsp; This is
Ben Cameron.&nbsp; He sees these

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:48.700
young white children playing
with the black children,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:55.300
dressed up as piccaninnies
with their hair and such.&nbsp;

00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:03.067
And it's hard to
see on the screen,

00:43:03.067 --> 00:43:09.700
but their eyes get bug eyed,
and they're terrified.&nbsp; Like

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:15.700
I said, it wasn't the most
subtle of films.&nbsp; And so you

00:43:37.167 --> 00:43:43.167
see your depictions
of black depravity,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.800
of desire for white
women.&nbsp; You also see,

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.967
of course, the
loyal servants who are,

00:43:57.967 --> 00:44:01.500
sort of, the Mammy figure,
the--the heavyset black

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.767
woman, again these
characters--these main

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:05.767
characters in black face.

00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:06.900
You didn't see much
of it, Silas Lynch.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.700
I pointed him out to
you, but the mixed race

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:15.267
individual, that's
northern--appointed by a

00:44:15.267 --> 00:44:17.200
northern representative to
come down and take control

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.367
of the South, and he
desires white women.&nbsp; Gus,

00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:25.400
the servant, who made
eyes at the Mammy figure,

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.667
is the one who
desires white women,

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:31.467
once he's armed as a member
of the northern militia.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.767
The fear
embodied in this film,

00:44:38.767 --> 00:44:40.900
the anxiety, is what I
really want you to take away

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.100
from it, and the fact that
the film was terrifically

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.300
popular.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.200
It wasn't just popular as
a--as an organizing tool for

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.867
the Klan.&nbsp; It was
the top grossing film.

00:44:54.867 --> 00:44:58.800
I mean I don't know if this
statistic is still true in

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:04.800
our Avatar age, and
some people actually see

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.200
connections to Avatar and
the kind of racial logic of

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.500
a film likeBirth of a
Nation.&nbsp; But the film,

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.800
off of seventy-five cent
and two dollar tickets,

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.700
earns over ten million
dollars in its first

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:19.467
release.&nbsp; Unbelievable
amounts of money.&nbsp; And it

00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:22.400
also earned the specific
attention of the young--of

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.900
the young NAACP, which
lauded--which issued a

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.400
forty-seven page pamphlet
titled Fighting a Vicious

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.100
Film: Protest Against The
Birth of the Nation.&nbsp; They

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.667
would hold
rallies at the theater,

00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:35.900
wherever the film
was being shown,

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.267
protesting its screening.&nbsp;
And it famously referred to

00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:43.867
the film as "three miles of
filth."&nbsp; This is the state

00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:48.467
of the--the culture at the
moment.&nbsp; Black Americans

00:45:48.467 --> 00:45:53.067
in--in flux, migration
not happening in a uniform

00:45:53.067 --> 00:45:54.200
direction or at
a uniform pace,

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.700
but happening, clearly.&nbsp;
Detroit's black population

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.200
blossoms by six hundred
percent in a ten-year span.&nbsp;

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.600
Black enclaves in places
that didn't--they just

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.500
simply weren't there before
are now there.&nbsp; So the

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:13.267
reorganizing, repopulating
of black America is

00:46:13.267 --> 00:46:16.900
beginning here and continues
in earnest until around the

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.467
1970s when the--when the
population numbers begin to

00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:21.600
settle--settle down, the
migration--migration numbers

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600
settle down.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.100
And actually, we're in an
age where the migration is

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.500
reversing for the first time
since this--since the start

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.767
of the twentieth century.

00:46:29.767 --> 00:46:33.900
We're not exactly sure why
yet as far as demographers.&nbsp;

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.200
We're dealing with a radical
shift of population and,

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.500
and related to that, a
radical rise in social

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.500
anxieties and a
determination to control

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.300
it.&nbsp; And we'll see how that
control is manifested beyond

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.300
the Klan and Birth of a
Nation on Wednesday's

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.300
lecture.&nbsp; Thank you.

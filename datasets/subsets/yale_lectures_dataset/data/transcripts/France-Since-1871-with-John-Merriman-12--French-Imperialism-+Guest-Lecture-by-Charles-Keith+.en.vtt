00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.990
Charles Keith: Thanks.
As Professor Merriman said,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm going to talk today about
the French Empire from 1871,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.835
the year that the course
begins, to 1914,

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:13.290
which is the beginning of World
War I,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.638
of course;
which is something that you'll

00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:18.636
talk about, if I'm not mistaken,
in the lecture right after this

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.659
one.
So, I'm going to start the

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.166
lecture with a passage from a
French novel called Le

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.610
Maître de la Mer,
The Master of the Sea.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.594
It was written by Vicomte
Melchior de Vogüé

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.383
published in 1900;
so, right in the middle of the

00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:37.104
period we're talking about.
The novel is about an Army

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.552
officer who is so upset by the
defeat at the hands of Prussia

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:43.886
and the loss of Alsace-Lorraine
that he leaves France to go

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:46.070
serve in a regiment in the
Sudan,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.001
in the heart of West Africa.
At one point during the novel

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.191
the young officer returns to
France and he meets an older

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.470
general from his father's
generation.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.085
So, during their conversation
the older general expresses some

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:02.641
anger that the young officer
seemed to be more concerned with

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.409
adventuring,
in his words,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.127
than with recovering the lands
where his father's generation

00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:10.854
had fallen.
The young officer replied to

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:14.148
him, this is a quote,
"are we to blame if the world

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:17.970
around us has changed and grown
all out of recognition?

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.745
Diplomacy used to be concerned
with the Mediterranean and the

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:24.714
Bosphorus;
now it has to do with China and

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:27.132
the Congo.
The great states of Europe are

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:30.453
dividing up the other continents
of Africa and Asia in the way

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:33.610
they used to divide up countries
like Italy and Poland.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.765
What used to be a European
balance of power is now a world

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.071
balance of power,
and any country which does not

00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:44.400
wish to become less important
must obtain as much new

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.769
territory as our rivals are
doing.

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:50.014
It is through colonies,"
concluded the young officer,

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:53.508
"that we shall one day achieve
your life's ambition"--the

00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:57.201
ambition of the older general.
"I give you my word of honor,"

00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:00.395
he said, "that you are mistaken
in thinking that this ambition

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.942
has died in our hearts."
During the period I'm talking

00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:08.060
about today the French Empire
quite literally exploded.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.272
An empire that in 1871 had been
little more than parts of

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:16.710
Algeria and a military presence
in parts of North Africa,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.508
Southeast Asia,
and a few small spits of land

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:23.580
in the Pacific and the Caribbean
exploded to include large swaths

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.517
of North Africa and West Africa,
most of mainland Southeast

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:31.382
Asia, parts of the Middle East,
and territories in the Pacific

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:35.445
and the Caribbean as well.
By the end of World War I the

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:39.590
French Empire spanned eleven
million kilometers and one

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.281
hundred million inhabitants.
So, just to put it in the

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.798
context of France,
that's twice as many people as

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.629
lived in metropolitan France at
that time, roughly.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.050
So, I chose the passage from
the novel to begin this lecture

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.587
because it captures what I think
are the two central themes in

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:58.080
this period in French colonial
history.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.272
Both the young officer and the
older general in the novel are

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:04.252
serving in the French army
because they are obsessed with

00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:07.445
recovering the national strength
and prestige that France had

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.000
lost in the devastating defeat
to Prussia.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.021
Now, the older general thinks
about this in terms of

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:16.022
recovering Alsace-Lorraine,
in terms of continental

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:19.534
rivalries, but the young officer
sees France's road to greatness

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:22.660
in very different terms;
he sees it overseas,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.422
outside of Europe.
So, my first point is that in

00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:31.174
these decades after 1871 French
nationalism became increasingly

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:35.390
inseparable from the idea of a
large and strong colonial

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.430
empire.
France had had colonies for a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.669
long time, but the fusion of a
more modern and mass form of

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.910
nationalism with colonialism was
new in French history,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.038
to this period,
and it was something that drove

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:50.750
the explosion of the French
Empire,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.517
that I just described,
to its heights in the years

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.707
just after World War I.
The second point that I want to

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:59.690
make about the novel is simply
that it was a novel.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.781
It was one of many novels
written about empire during this

00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:05.221
period.
And novels were just one of the

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.934
many forms of popular culture
that began to reflect France's

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:11.993
growing presence overseas.
Indeed, during the late

00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:15.211
nineteenth century empire became
something that more and more

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:17.250
French people experienced
directly,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.106
whether through popular culture
or sometimes in much more active

00:04:21.106 --> 00:04:23.706
ways, serving in the army,
or in the navy,

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:27.370
or in colonial administrations,
or even settling lands that had

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.620
not been part of France when
those people were born.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.260
So, what I would like you to
take away from this lecture is

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.089
that during the Third Republic
empire became a central part of

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:41.668
French national identity.
Empire was something that all

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:45.490
political platforms in France
discussed and took positions on.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.827
It was part of the idea of
French national greatness that

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:52.759
citizens were beginning to learn
in the schools of the Republic.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.069
It was in the national
newspapers that more and more

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.248
people were reading,
and it even for some became a

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:03.105
career and a way of life.
So, in its many forms empire

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:06.984
during this period became a
common experience for French

00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:08.975
people,
whether they were from

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.898
Brittany, or from Burgundy,
or from Provence or the

00:05:11.898 --> 00:05:15.485
Ardèche.
In short, empire was a central

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:20.104
part of making people French.
Although it was in the decades

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:23.855
after 1871 that France's
colonial empire truly became a

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:27.729
part of national identity,
empire had a long past in

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.293
French history.
During the seventeenth and

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:33.408
eighteenth centuries France had
territories in the Caribbean

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:35.310
and, of course,
in North America.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.274
Although many of these were
lost during the era of the

00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:40.848
French Revolution,
one of the Revolution's most

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:43.869
powerful legacies was the idea
of a moral imperative to

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.889
continue the revolution beyond
France's borders;

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.645
in other words,
France had not only a right but

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:52.820
a duty to bring French
civilization to the rest of the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.435
world.
Even as the revolution raged in

00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:58.490
France at the close of the
eighteenth century,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.429
the Republic's armies had
poured outward into Europe to

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:04.750
bring the rights of men to the
monarchies of the continent.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.234
This continued,
of course, with Napoleon who

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:10.874
extended the reach of the nation
completely across Europe before

00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:13.589
its hands froze in the cold
Russian plains.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.178
Napoleon also believed,
and this is important,

00:06:16.178 --> 00:06:18.709
that France was destined to
quote/unquote,

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.686
"civilize those who were not
only not French,

00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:25.012
but not European."
Napoleon attempted to colonize

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:28.300
Egypt just at the turn of the
nineteenth century,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.778
and his attempt combined a
messianic belief in science and

00:06:32.778 --> 00:06:37.414
progress, an absence of any real
knowledge about non-Western

00:06:37.414 --> 00:06:40.209
world,
and a predisposition for the

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.870
idea that non-white races were
inferior to whites,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.265
to Europeans.
And this was a potent

00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:49.097
combination of nationalism with
ideas about race and

00:06:49.097 --> 00:06:52.261
civilization that would drive
French colonialism until its

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:54.959
bitter end.
This combination came to be

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:58.509
known in French as the
mission civilisatrice,

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.056
the civilizing mission,
the idea that a Greco-Roman

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.947
heritage, Christianity,
the legacy of the

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:06.854
Enlightenment,
modern science,

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:10.471
capitalism, that all these
things made France inherently

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:14.285
superior and gave it a moral
responsibility to export these

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:18.100
legacies of its civilization to
the less fortunate.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.156
So, although France had a long
history of empire,

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:24.657
at the birth of the Third
Republic in 1871 the upheavals

00:07:24.657 --> 00:07:28.159
of many revolutions and the
Paris Commune meant that the

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.980
overseas empire had been fairly
small for a long time,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.715
and that it was at that point
pretty marginal in national

00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:38.915
politics and culture.
In the years before the French

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:41.857
defeat by Prussia the French
government's control over

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:44.800
territorial expansion was
actually pretty limited.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.525
The main urge to expand came
not from French politicians but

00:07:48.525 --> 00:07:52.502
often from soldiers and sailors
in far off places who were often

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:55.912
prompted by missionaries who
urged intervention to save

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:58.337
souls,
or by businessmen who urged

00:07:58.337 --> 00:08:00.560
intervention to make a quick
franc.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.758
Even the bulk of French
expansion in Algeria after 1830

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:07.193
(Algeria was really France's
major colony in the years--for

00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:10.805
most of the nineteenth century)
even this was largely the work

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:14.300
of generals who waved the flag
and shot their rifles,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.987
often in direct opposition to
the wishes of national

00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:19.999
governments in Paris.
So, at times it really seemed

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.536
like the French Empire was
little more than a giant system

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.769
of relief for the armed
services.

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:29.553
As one former colonial governor
wrote, "what drove us to expand

00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:33.275
in far away places was above all
the need to find something to

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:37.404
occupy the army and the navy."
But this began to change in

00:08:37.404 --> 00:08:41.198
important ways after 1871.
In French politics after the

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:44.984
end of the disastrous war with
Prussia the overriding question

00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:48.647
for many was how France could
regain its place as a national

00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:51.690
power,
as a great power among Europe.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.253
The war with Prussia had shown
that Germany was a nation on the

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:58.070
move, and England's dominance in
world affairs,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.669
especially its empire,
was unquestioned.

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:04.160
As you all know by now,
politics in France during the

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.919
1870s and the 1880s were
tumultuous, to say the least.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:11.398
As France hobbled from one
affaire to the next

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:15.277
critics attacked the Republic as
a cesspool of intrigue and

00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:17.936
scandal.
Periodic industrial downturns

00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:21.008
brought political challenges
from left and right,

00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:24.783
as Boulangism and socialism
both threatened to overthrow the

00:09:24.783 --> 00:09:27.301
Republic.
France also suffered from the

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.039
lowest birthrate among Western
European nations.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:33.943
So, emasculated militarily,
slumping economically,

00:09:33.943 --> 00:09:38.404
shrinking demographically,
France appeared to many people

00:09:38.404 --> 00:09:41.830
to be in a state of inevitable
decline.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.094
Staring at this specter of
national stagnation and fading

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:48.209
international relevance,
many luminaries of the young

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:51.523
Third Republic believed that the
key to recovering France's

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:54.779
greatness lay in the expansion
of its colonial empire.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:57.979
Perhaps the most famous of
these advocates of colonial

00:09:57.979 --> 00:10:01.240
expansion among the political
elite was Jules Ferry,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.194
who was of course the famous
advocate of the école

00:10:04.194 --> 00:10:07.248
républicaine and the
battles over that in the 1870s

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:09.722
and 1880s.
Ferry's arguments for imperial

00:10:09.722 --> 00:10:12.618
expansion in many ways
encapsulate French colonial

00:10:12.618 --> 00:10:15.159
ideology in the late nineteenth
century.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.978
Ferry believed,
in his words,

00:10:16.978 --> 00:10:20.745
quote, "that colonial policy
was the daughter of industrial

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.962
policy;
enriched states where capital

00:10:22.962 --> 00:10:25.758
abounds and accumulates,
where the manufacturing system

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.287
is undergoing continual growth,
export is an essential factor

00:10:29.287 --> 00:10:31.626
in public prosperity."
In other words,

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:35.000
colonies were essential to a
strong national economy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.061
And the rise of Germany and
even the rise of the United

00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:41.350
States and Russia meant that
France needed exclusive access

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.751
to new markets and sources for
raw materials that in the eyes

00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:47.529
of many people only colonies
could provide.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:51.710
Closely tied to these economic
imperatives of empire were

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.762
strategic ones.
Rivalries between nations in

00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:58.771
Europe, as they often had in the
past, spilled out into the rest

00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:02.220
of the world,
and a nation that wished to

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.753
survive had to compete.
Quote, this is Ferry again,

00:11:05.753 --> 00:11:08.298
"in today's Europe,
in this competition of the many

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:10.690
rivals whose power we see
growing around us,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.500
a policy of abstention is very
simply the road to decadence.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.846
In the times in which we live
nations are only great in

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:22.070
accordance with the activities
which they develop.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.495
Exerting ourselves without
action, regarding all expansion

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:28.679
in Africa and the Orient as a
trap or an adventure,

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.519
to live in this way,
believe me, is to abdicate our

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:35.097
position and to tumble from the
first to the third or the fourth

00:11:35.097 --> 00:11:38.607
rank of nations."
Ferry also believed in what he

00:11:38.607 --> 00:11:43.320
called the humanitarian and
civilizing side of the question.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.876
In his words,
quote, "superior races have a

00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:48.980
right vis-à-vis inferior
races," he wrote.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.531
"But they also have a duty,"
and this is echoing the language

00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:53.509
of the French revolution,
almost directly,

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:55.789
"they also have a duty to bring
civilization,

00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:59.397
Western government,
education, medicine and morals

00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:02.913
to other peoples."
So, for men like Jules Ferry it

00:12:02.913 --> 00:12:06.379
was the greatness of the nation,
of the French nation,

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:10.225
that made the expansion of the
French Empire not only necessary

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:13.237
but legitimate.
It was the colonial empire that

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:16.519
would save France from losing
ground to its rivals,

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:20.088
and that would help elevate the
cultures and the civilizations

00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:22.370
of the peoples that France
colonized.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.176
So, in the 1880s politicians
like Ferry brought France's

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:30.258
colonial ambitions into national
politics in ways never seen

00:12:30.258 --> 00:12:32.562
before.
Indeed, just a few years after

00:12:32.562 --> 00:12:35.750
national political power swung
decisively to the Republicans,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.970
in 1879, Ferry's government
launched a campaign to try to

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.362
jump-start France's stagnating
presence in southeast Asia by

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:45.639
taking over the northern half of
what is now Vietnam;

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:48.652
it was then called Tonkin,
and the French had tried to

00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:51.379
take this on several occasions
but had failed.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:54.852
On the pretext of defending
persecuted Vietnamese Catholics

00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:57.606
and attacking pirates,
the French sent several

00:12:57.606 --> 00:13:01.039
companies of soldiers north to
attack the capital of Hanoi.

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:03.448
The campaign was just a little
too ambitious,

00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:06.240
and a French captain,
a man named Rivière,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.472
ended up with his head on a
pikestaff in the middle of the

00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:11.760
city.
Yes, this happens places other

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.029
than France, heads getting cut
off.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.701
Ferry's aggressive colonial
expansion was really very

00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.712
unpopular at first.
Georges Clemenceau accused him

00:13:19.712 --> 00:13:23.449
of high treason and crowds
outside shouted for Ferry's head

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:26.220
on a pikestaff next to
Rivière's.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.492
Nevertheless,
Ferry's insertion of colonial

00:13:28.492 --> 00:13:31.684
affairs onto the national stage
was a sign of the prominence

00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:34.767
that empire would come to play
in national politics in the

00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:37.483
years to come.
Just after Ferry's demise in

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.282
national politics,
French colonial activity began

00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:43.956
to expand at a rapid rate as the
Third Republic raced to compete

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:47.070
with the British,
and the Germans, and the Dutch.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.445
By the 1890s debates over
colonial policy had become a

00:13:50.445 --> 00:13:54.139
standard part of discussions in
the Chamber of Deputies,

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:57.625
and every government after
Jules Ferry's presided over a

00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.970
steadily expanding colonial
empire.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.880
This new prominence of colonial
issues in French national

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.279
politics was in many ways due to
the activities of a growing and

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:12.049
very influential colonial lobby
in French society.

00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:15.311
So, in many ways it was this
colonial lobby that was most

00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:18.863
responsible for imagining and
spreading the idea that national

00:14:18.863 --> 00:14:21.950
greatness was closely tied to
colonial expansion.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.918
What was this colonial lobby?
I want to emphasize that it was

00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:29.899
not a single organization or
formal movement,

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:33.766
it really was more a large and
very diverse group of

00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:38.012
individuals and associations who
put forward the case for

00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:41.500
colonial expansion in many
different ways.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.669
The colonial lobby was not
organized by an executive

00:14:45.669 --> 00:14:48.476
committee;
it had no organized sections

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:52.000
and no clearly defined program
or electoral platform.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.448
It was far beyond the vocal
colonial advocates in the

00:14:56.448 --> 00:14:59.740
Chamber of Deputies.
It included men like the

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.326
informal group of explorers and
geographers who met every week

00:15:03.326 --> 00:15:06.383
in Paris at the Petite Vache
brasserie to share their

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:09.868
fascination with exotic places,
and to talk about how the

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:13.097
government might be able to
better promote and support these

00:15:13.097 --> 00:15:16.608
voyages of exploration.
The colonial lobby included

00:15:16.608 --> 00:15:19.238
shipbuilders,
and railway magnates,

00:15:19.238 --> 00:15:22.958
and factory owners,
people who believed that the

00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.068
colonies were the way to--were
the path to untold material

00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:29.191
wealth.
It included missionaries who

00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:31.944
saw in the, quote/unquote,
"heathen races" of Africa and

00:15:31.944 --> 00:15:34.797
Asia a potential source for
converts to replace the French

00:15:34.797 --> 00:15:36.700
who were starting to skip
church,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.009
and starting to use birth
control in even greater numbers.

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:44.414
It included writers and
journalists for whom the

00:15:44.414 --> 00:15:47.529
colonies were little more than
good copy.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.567
So, those who made up the
colonial lobby weren't united at

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:53.389
all by the same interests,
but it was precisely this

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:56.581
diversity of their interests
that shows how compelling empire

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:59.188
was becoming for so many
different parts of French

00:15:59.188 --> 00:16:01.911
society.
So, indeed during the 1880s and

00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:05.055
1890s the assumption
increasingly became that the

00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:07.480
French colonies served the
nation,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.940
they served the nation as a
whole, in ways that went further

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.460
and further beyond economic and
geo-strategic necessities.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.485
Many parts of French society
increasingly came to see empire

00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:21.009
as a solution to national
problems.

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:23.951
In the words of the historian
Gwendolyn Wright,

00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:25.933
the colonies were
quote/unquote,

00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:29.951
"a laboratory of modernity;"
they were places to further and

00:16:29.951 --> 00:16:32.750
protect the destiny of the
nation, literally,

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.440
quite literally through
experiments in nation building.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.809
Before the Third Republic
colonies had been seen--really,

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:43.178
the social value of colonies
was little more than seen as

00:16:43.178 --> 00:16:46.307
getting rid of people that the
State considered to be

00:16:46.307 --> 00:16:49.264
undesirable.
The French penal colony in New

00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:53.013
Caledonia was a good example of
this, where over 4,000 of the

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.700
communards had been sent
in 1871.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.110
But toward the end of the
century this began to change.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.351
Social reformers began to see
the colonies as a potential home

00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:04.970
for landless peasants,
for the unemployed,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.319
or even for orphans who had no
home in France.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.299
In other words,
colonies were places that could

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:13.862
serve to solve the nation's
problems and not merely lock

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:18.081
them up and throw away the key.
French engineers and social

00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:22.562
planners came to see the Empire
as really a vast worksite where

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:26.899
new forms of architecture and
urban planning could be carried

00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:28.971
out,
places where experiments could

00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:30.819
be carried out to help benefit
France.

00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:34.245
Hubert Lyautey was a famous
French military officer and

00:17:34.245 --> 00:17:37.289
future administrator in the
colony of Morocco.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:40.152
He insisted that North Africa
was for France,

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:42.950
quote, "what the far west is
for America,

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.414
an excellent testing ground for
creating new energy,

00:17:46.414 --> 00:17:48.519
rejuvenation,
and fecundity."

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.718
The French military likewise
saw colonies as a training

00:17:51.718 --> 00:17:55.154
ground where the army and the
navy could protect and expand

00:17:55.154 --> 00:17:59.093
France's overseas interests,
and in doing so could learn to

00:17:59.093 --> 00:18:01.410
better defend the nation at
home.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.333
So, as empire became a more
important part of French

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:09.718
national debates it also started
to become an increasingly

00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:13.950
central part of popular culture
and life in France.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.130
School children began reading
about colonies in textbooks.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.191
One directive from the Ministry
of Education read that,

00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.252
quote, "it must not be
forgotten that France is a world

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:26.710
power which possesses colonies
in all parts of the earth.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.349
Let us not have any scruples
about retaining for two years,

00:18:30.349 --> 00:18:33.111
just two years,
the attention of French youth

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.695
on France.
Let us give them as rich an

00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:39.295
image as possible for their
country, of the mother country

00:18:39.295 --> 00:18:42.066
and her distant daughters."
French citizens,

00:18:42.066 --> 00:18:44.969
already out of school,
began to learn about the empire

00:18:44.969 --> 00:18:46.802
in different ways.
For example,

00:18:46.802 --> 00:18:50.216
the urban middle classes who
visited the Museum of Man or the

00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:53.517
Museum of Natural History in
Paris began to see collections

00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:54.906
of art,
of clothing,

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:57.909
and household objects,
and other things collected in

00:18:57.909 --> 00:19:01.619
the French Empire by scientific
societies that were brought back

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:05.626
to Paris to be put on display.
The colonies were put on

00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:10.169
display in even more spectacular
fashion at international

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:14.144
expositions which were held in
Paris in 1878,1889,

00:19:14.144 --> 00:19:16.560
and 1900.
The exposition of 1900,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.287
which quite literally took over
the city of Paris,

00:19:19.287 --> 00:19:22.403
in that exposition colonies
were for the first time given

00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:25.631
their own separate exposition
grounds in the gardens behind

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:28.653
the Trocadero Palace,
across the Seine from the

00:19:28.653 --> 00:19:30.351
Eiffel Tower,
and were, quote,

00:19:30.351 --> 00:19:33.747
"set apart enough by the river
to permit the creation of an

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:36.849
atmosphere different from the
rest of the fair."

00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:39.954
Entire colonial buildings were
transported to Paris and

00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:42.114
rebuilt.
Colonial workmen were brought

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:45.229
to France to execute the detail
and decorative work on the

00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:47.171
buildings,
and they remained there

00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:49.795
throughout the exhibition,
posing as residents and

00:19:49.795 --> 00:19:52.740
merchants in the reconstructed
villages and bazaars,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.168
from far away.
Mosques, temples,

00:19:56.168 --> 00:19:59.253
archeological discoveries,
dancers, music and food,

00:19:59.253 --> 00:20:02.522
all were brought to create a
self-contained world that

00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:06.224
attempted to represent France's
growing empire to the average

00:20:06.224 --> 00:20:09.904
French person.
The empire was more than a

00:20:09.904 --> 00:20:14.319
periodic occasion for spectacle.
Colonies slowly but surely

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:17.099
crept into the most mundane
forms of everyday life.

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:19.301
Readers of French newspapers,
for example,

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.415
like the Petit Journal,
read more and more about the

00:20:22.415 --> 00:20:24.509
French empire every day as it
grew.

00:20:24.509 --> 00:20:27.073
For the most part,
articles focused on military

00:20:27.073 --> 00:20:29.859
encounters and on the French who
fought in them.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.332
African or Asian opponents
merely filled the need in these

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:35.769
stories for an evil or a savage
enemy.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.858
They were a backdrop for main
characters in a drama that

00:20:38.858 --> 00:20:41.385
unfolded every day,
a story that more and more

00:20:41.385 --> 00:20:45.286
Frenchmen loved to follow.
Other readers read novels that

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:49.055
evoked the exotically
different--the strange customs

00:20:49.055 --> 00:20:51.342
of natives,
the bright colors and the

00:20:51.342 --> 00:20:54.098
pungent odors of overseas,
and the lure of the desert or

00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:55.651
of the jungle.
Pierre Loti,

00:20:55.651 --> 00:20:58.397
who was one of the most famous
of these writers,

00:20:58.397 --> 00:21:01.493
wrote panoramas of colonial
life that were packed with

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.130
adventure,
with danger,

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.920
with sex and with local color,
quote/unquote,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.089
"in which hardy Frenchmen lived
the rough life,

00:21:09.089 --> 00:21:12.931
the sensual pleasures,
and the fighting spirit of the

00:21:12.931 --> 00:21:15.478
Empire."
Artists like Paul Gauguin and

00:21:15.478 --> 00:21:18.472
Henri Matisse began painting
Levantine harems and

00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:21.115
souks,
African villages and jungles,

00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:24.519
temples in Indochina and native
life throughout the Empire.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:28.164
Colonies were a rich source of
subjects for the growing medium

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:30.303
of photography.
Photographers liked

00:21:30.303 --> 00:21:33.260
photographing the rice paddies
in the Mekong River,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.329
Buddhist monks in saffron
robes,

00:21:35.329 --> 00:21:39.644
mysterious Muslim women behind
veils, and cannibals with

00:21:39.644 --> 00:21:42.543
spears.
These images were reproduced in

00:21:42.543 --> 00:21:45.869
books, newspapers,
postcards and other places.

00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:49.405
The French encountered empire
in many other ways in their

00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:52.439
daily lives.
Colonial influences began to be

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:54.450
heard in music,
for example.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.900
Café and dancehall goers
heard songs like Ma belle

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.531
tonkinoise,
about a Frenchman's Vietnamese

00:22:00.531 --> 00:22:02.225
concubine.
I can't resist,

00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:04.910
I'm going to read it:
"N'entends tu pas a ta

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.470
fenêtre celui qui t'aime,
ton quartier-maître?

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.214
Je reviens de Tonkin où
j'ai fini, hereux de te revoir,

00:22:12.214 --> 00:22:13.849
ma jolie.
J'ai quitté

00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.839
ma belle tonkinoise.
C'est pour toi,

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:17.869
ma charmante
Françoise.

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:20.279
Tu étais la plus
belle de l'îsle,

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:22.789
loin de toi je n'étais
pas tranquil."

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:25.718
"Don't you hear at your window,
he who loves you,

00:22:25.718 --> 00:22:28.593
your quartermaster?
I'm back from Tonkin where I've

00:22:28.593 --> 00:22:30.650
finished, happy to see you,
my darling.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.422
I've left my beautiful
Tonkinoise for you my charming

00:22:34.422 --> 00:22:37.403
Francois.
For you are the most beautiful

00:22:37.403 --> 00:22:40.562
of the isle.
Far from you I was not at

00:22:40.562 --> 00:22:43.118
peace."
More bourgeois music lovers

00:22:43.118 --> 00:22:46.472
heard orchestral works by
composers like Ravel and

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:50.579
Debussy, who were fascinated by
the sounds of the Orient.

00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:54.609
The colonies also came to
suggest new fashions.

00:22:54.609 --> 00:22:57.419
Oriental silks and Levantine
frocks, popular in women's

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:00.385
clothing in the early twentieth
century, owed much to this

00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:03.872
fascination with the exotic.
Even the goods that people

00:23:03.872 --> 00:23:07.588
bought increasingly evoked the
colonies, often through

00:23:07.588 --> 00:23:10.620
advertising.
One of the most famous French

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.805
advertisements ever,
for example,

00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:16.509
is the publicity for Banania,
a sweet powdered beverage made

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:19.294
from bananas that when mixed
with milk makes a breakfast

00:23:19.294 --> 00:23:21.701
food.
The yellow Banania box featured

00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.316
a derogatory caricature of a
smiling African uttering the

00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:30.041
pigeon phrase in French,
"y'a bon Banania," "good

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:33.099
stuff Banania."
Things like this brought the

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:36.138
empire all the way to the
breakfast tables of many French

00:23:36.138 --> 00:23:38.950
families.
French people even began to

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.615
encounter the empire in church.
The last third of the

00:23:42.615 --> 00:23:45.720
nineteenth century was a time of
intense Catholic missionary

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.000
activity outside of France,
usually in the French colonies,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.126
and churchgoers in France
listened to the appeals of their

00:23:52.126 --> 00:23:55.471
priests to donate money to help
a French missionary from their

00:23:55.471 --> 00:23:58.871
département away
in far- off Indochina or Senegal

00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:02.052
replace a little bamboo or straw
chapel with a proper brick

00:24:02.052 --> 00:24:02.930
church.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:09.946
Of course, there was no better
way to experience,

00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:12.269
or more intense way,
I would say,

00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:15.076
to experience empire than to
actually go there,

00:24:15.076 --> 00:24:18.371
and in the late nineteenth
century more and more French

00:24:18.371 --> 00:24:21.943
people did exactly that.
Until the 1880s and the 1890s

00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:25.928
there were relatively few French
people in territories that the

00:24:25.928 --> 00:24:29.835
French controlled as colonies,
with the exception again of

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:33.670
Algeria, which had about 300,000
French settlers in 1871.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.036
This really was an exception.
Even by the 1880s or 1890s

00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:41.369
places like Indochina only had
probably between 20,000 and

00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:44.410
30,000, at the most,
maybe even less.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.346
So, at first many of these
French colonies had little more

00:24:47.346 --> 00:24:49.698
than administrators,
garrisons of troops,

00:24:49.698 --> 00:24:52.805
and some explorers and
missionaries beating the bush

00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:55.663
for riches or for souls.
Gradually, however,

00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:59.368
more and more French citizens
came to overseas territories,

00:24:59.368 --> 00:25:02.369
not for adventure but just to
make a living.

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:05.344
The part of French society most
immediately affected,

00:25:05.344 --> 00:25:08.632
of course, was the military,
which went to the colonies in

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:11.884
increasingly greater numbers as
the empire, and resistance to

00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:13.680
it,
spread.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.609
Soldiers in the empire risked
long sea journeys,

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:19.851
and tropical diseases,
and miserable pay for the risk

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:23.280
and the adventure that they
thought that they might find

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.128
over there.
Missionaries too,

00:25:25.128 --> 00:25:27.076
as I mentioned,
went overseas more and more

00:25:27.076 --> 00:25:29.952
toward the end of the century to
try to find converts that they

00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:32.626
weren't finding in France.
Apart from soldiers,

00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:35.223
and traders,
and missionaries were settlers

00:25:35.223 --> 00:25:39.180
who increasingly went to the
colonies not for a tour of duty,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:43.443
but they went there to stay.
Settlers were often committed

00:25:43.443 --> 00:25:46.785
to the colonies for life.
They gave up the resources they

00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:49.053
possessed at home,
they took to the colonies

00:25:49.053 --> 00:25:52.165
whatever capital and whatever
possessions they could get and

00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:55.443
could carry with them.
The colonies were not

00:25:55.443 --> 00:25:58.619
hospitable places,
needless to say.

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:02.247
Remoteness from France and
relatives, tropical diseases,

00:26:02.247 --> 00:26:05.412
and a very understandable
hostility of indigenous

00:26:05.412 --> 00:26:09.039
populations were a major
deterrent for many people.

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:14.016
However, a number of French men
and women did dare a new life in

00:26:14.016 --> 00:26:17.650
the Maghreb, in Indochina or in
West Africa.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.694
Many were drawn by the
inducements of people who owned

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:23.739
large tracts of land and who
needed people to work and

00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:26.670
cultivate this land to help them
turn a profit.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.419
When there weren't enough
Frenchmen, landowners didn't

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:32.635
hesitate to populate their lands
with non-French Europeans like

00:26:32.635 --> 00:26:35.411
Italian and Spanish,
some of whom were also in the

00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:38.314
colonies as members of the
famous international military

00:26:38.314 --> 00:26:39.650
force,
the Légion

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.930
Étrangère,
the Foreign Legion.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:47.669
As the French Empire grew,
life in the empire became,

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:52.729
slowly, more regularized.
The French government began to

00:26:52.729 --> 00:26:56.264
replace soldiers and sailors
with administrators who

00:26:56.264 --> 00:27:00.192
exercised the will of the State.
These administrators held

00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:03.920
responsibility for collecting
taxes, for overseeing spending,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.105
and for keeping law and order,
which often mean authorizing

00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:09.961
violence against those who
resisted the spread of the

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.978
French Empire.
Increasingly these

00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:15.522
administrators came not from the
ranks of the military but from

00:27:15.522 --> 00:27:19.124
new schools founded in France to
train people for service in the

00:27:19.124 --> 00:27:21.693
Empire.
One of the most famous of these

00:27:21.693 --> 00:27:24.670
was the École Coloniale,
founded in 1887,

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.954
which taught future
administrators a little bit

00:27:26.954 --> 00:27:29.736
about the language and the
culture of the place that they

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:32.280
were being sent,
as well as the basics of the

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.880
position that they were going to
fill when they were over there.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.362
The French government also did
its best to draw professionals

00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:42.654
to newly acquired territories;
lawyers, doctors,

00:27:42.654 --> 00:27:46.875
engineers, surveyors,
all of these were much needed

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:50.052
in the empire,
and Paris offered subsidiaries

00:27:50.052 --> 00:27:53.130
to get qualified candidates to
take a post overseas.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.559
As the empire continued to
grow, more and more women came

00:27:56.559 --> 00:28:00.356
to live in these places that had
for a long time been perceived

00:28:00.356 --> 00:28:04.456
as much too dangerous for them.
In many ways the domesticity

00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:08.229
that the arrival of women
brought to French life in the

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:12.561
colonies was the clearest sign
of the idea of domesticating and

00:28:12.561 --> 00:28:16.963
even taming French colonies and
integrating them into the sphere

00:28:16.963 --> 00:28:20.279
of greater France.
Places that had once been

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:23.985
considered too dangerous for
women became places where women

00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:26.559
eager to marry went to find a
husband.

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:29.886
A book called La Femme aux
colonies,

00:28:29.886 --> 00:28:33.609
The Women in the Colonies,
published in 1900,

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:37.150
assured interested women that
the empire could provide a

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.759
hospitable home,
quote,

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:41.682
"a woman who arrives in Tonkin,
for example,

00:28:41.682 --> 00:28:45.478
is sure of success.
There are no women in Tonkin

00:28:45.478 --> 00:28:48.509
who fail to marry."
There were, of course,

00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:52.039
women who did not go to the
colonies simply for marriage,

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:55.817
and even those who did found
themselves pushed out of normal

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:59.529
social expectations by the
necessities of colonial life.

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.711
Many women in the colonies,
for example,

00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:05.067
were drawn into humanitarian
work at hospitals or in distance

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:07.930
areas or orphanages;
which is ironic in light of the

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.726
positions that many of their
husbands held in the colonial

00:29:10.726 --> 00:29:13.237
administration,
doing work that couldn't

00:29:13.237 --> 00:29:15.678
exactly be described as
humanitarian,

00:29:15.678 --> 00:29:18.039
of course.
So, just to put the expansion

00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:21.150
of the French population in the
colonies in the context of one

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.020
place,
let me just mention the

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.720
Algerian town of Annaba during
this period.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.975
Before the French conquest,
Annaba had a population of

00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:32.598
about 4,000 Arabs and Berbers,
some Turks and a fairly large

00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:36.136
Jewish population.
The French captured Annaba

00:29:36.136 --> 00:29:38.069
fairly early,
in 1832;

00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:41.635
but, for many years the
European population of the city

00:29:41.635 --> 00:29:45.795
was really little more than the
soldiers who kept control of the

00:29:45.795 --> 00:29:47.683
city.
By the mid-1840s,

00:29:47.683 --> 00:29:50.500
however, there were 5,000
Europeans.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.883
As time went by mines and
forests in that area became an

00:29:54.883 --> 00:29:58.470
attractive source of employment
for people.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.486
A railway line was built,
and the city and infrastructure

00:30:02.486 --> 00:30:05.736
slowly grew.
In fact, the city was also at

00:30:05.736 --> 00:30:09.762
that time renamed Bône.
A transient population of

00:30:09.762 --> 00:30:13.166
Europeans, mostly French,
evolved into a rooted and

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:14.969
stable one.
By the 1890s,

00:30:14.969 --> 00:30:18.434
Europeans born in Bône
outnumbered migrants from

00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:21.964
overseas and French citizens
formed the majority of the

00:30:21.964 --> 00:30:24.879
residents of the city.
Algeria is by far,

00:30:24.879 --> 00:30:28.136
of course, the French colony
with the largest French

00:30:28.136 --> 00:30:30.603
population,
but the others grew and grew

00:30:30.603 --> 00:30:33.244
during this time,
and by World War I there would

00:30:33.244 --> 00:30:36.109
be almost a half a million
French citizens scattered

00:30:36.109 --> 00:30:40.873
throughout the French Empire.
So, what was life like for

00:30:40.873 --> 00:30:44.616
these people?
Few men and women in the Empire

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:49.099
had lives that were as exciting
or as romantic as the newspapers

00:30:49.099 --> 00:30:53.369
and popular songs made the
colonial experience out to be.

00:30:53.369 --> 00:30:56.808
Despite being drawn to the
empire by the promise of

00:30:56.808 --> 00:31:00.590
adventure and prosperity,
few people who went over there

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.265
found either.
Disease took a large toll on

00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:06.328
French people in the colonies,
many of whom fell victim to

00:31:06.328 --> 00:31:09.401
malaria or yellow fever,
dengue fever or leprosy,

00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:13.049
before they had spent much time
in the colony at all.

00:31:13.049 --> 00:31:16.616
Attack was often--always a
concern, in fact,

00:31:16.616 --> 00:31:20.099
as were accidents in deserts or
jungles.

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:23.840
Medical care in the colonies
was often pretty inadequate.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.803
Working conditions were harsh.
Most settlers,

00:31:26.803 --> 00:31:29.240
for example,
had to build and maintain their

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.356
own houses, clear forests or
brush, and set up their own

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:34.627
shops.
Colonial goods were often

00:31:34.627 --> 00:31:38.383
susceptible to rapidly changing
market conditions and many

00:31:38.383 --> 00:31:42.059
colonists ended up in debt.
Many benefits offered by the

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:45.579
French State to its citizens
didn't extend to the empire,

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:49.455
and subsidies that people had
received to move to Algeria or

00:31:49.455 --> 00:31:51.819
to Morocco were quickly
exhausted.

00:31:51.819 --> 00:31:55.799
Social life in the colonies was
pretty limited.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:58.718
Bigger cities had theaters,
and some had art galleries and

00:31:58.718 --> 00:32:00.715
concert halls,
but in most places French

00:32:00.715 --> 00:32:03.531
citizens might spend months
without the sight of another

00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:05.996
European.
Most of the French who lived in

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:09.061
colonies never abandoned the
stereotypical attitudes that

00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:11.250
they had about their own
superiority,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.634
and these attitudes,
of course, were often

00:32:13.634 --> 00:32:17.008
reinforced by French laws and
institutions that gave whites

00:32:17.008 --> 00:32:19.799
more privileges than indigenous
populations.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:23.886
For the most part,
life was really quite separate

00:32:23.886 --> 00:32:27.889
between whites and others.
European neighborhoods again

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:30.490
had a town hall,
theaters, shops lining shaded

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.647
streets and cafés.
Very often indigenous peoples

00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:36.563
were separated from the French
by social barriers and by

00:32:36.563 --> 00:32:38.259
physical barriers,
sometimes.

00:32:38.259 --> 00:32:40.677
Markets and shops,
mosques and pagodas,

00:32:40.677 --> 00:32:43.539
were often apart from French
colonial life.

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:48.119
So, taking us now to World War
I.

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:52.237
When the guns of August began
to roar in August 1914,

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:55.960
the colonial empire was very
near its height.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.239
Paris controlled the second
largest empire in the world,

00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:02.262
second only to Britain's.
During the forty years before

00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:04.650
the First World War,
the empire spanned these vast

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.329
swaths of north and west Africa,
and southeast Asia;

00:33:07.329 --> 00:33:11.163
enormous islands like
Madagascar, famous cities like

00:33:11.163 --> 00:33:13.757
Timbuktu;
and it even contained parts of

00:33:13.757 --> 00:33:16.879
India, the crown jewel of the
empire of their fiercest

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:19.565
national rival.
Colonial promoters lauded the

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:22.817
benefits of an empire that they
said provided international

00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:25.454
prestige,
a secure place for investments,

00:33:25.454 --> 00:33:29.130
a market for French products,
a source for raw materials,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.855
and a reserve army of soldiers.
Empire had become a popular

00:33:32.855 --> 00:33:35.594
part of popular culture,
of daily life,

00:33:35.594 --> 00:33:39.269
and even a career for many
French men and women.

00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:43.858
In short, empire had become a
fundamental part of the national

00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:48.220
identity and in some ways the
national hubris then sweeping

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.912
through France,
not only France but the rest of

00:33:51.912 --> 00:33:55.357
Europe as well.
Just as many in France cheered

00:33:55.357 --> 00:33:58.849
at the declaration of war on
Germany in 1914,

00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:02.782
with no idea of what was to
come, few French people in 1914

00:34:02.782 --> 00:34:06.647
could see any reason to think
that anything might threaten

00:34:06.647 --> 00:34:10.172
this eternal marriage between
France and its outposts

00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:12.179
overseas,
between the brave,

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:15.480
beneficent purveyors of French
civilization and the "graceful

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.002
natives" under French rule.
For many people France had

00:34:19.002 --> 00:34:23.179
recovered completely from its
devastating defeat in 1871,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.354
and from the loss of
Alsace-Lorraine,

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:27.829
to once again become a powerful
nation.

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:31.604
Empire, again,
empire had been a central part

00:34:31.604 --> 00:34:35.865
of this national revival.
As one member of the colonial

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:39.153
lobby said in 1912,
quote, "it may be said that it

00:34:39.153 --> 00:34:43.426
was colonial expansion which,
coming as it did just after the

00:34:43.426 --> 00:34:46.650
events of 1871,
brought the renewal of France.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.269
It was on the day that France
became a colonial power again

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:53.639
that she became once more
conscious of her vitality and

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.552
her strength,
and was able to resume her role

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:59.480
in the concert of Europe and on
the world stage.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.506
Today when that role is
becoming so important again in

00:35:03.506 --> 00:35:07.029
the concert of Europe,
when France finds herself in

00:35:07.029 --> 00:35:10.186
all parts of the world on a
footing with the greatest

00:35:10.186 --> 00:35:13.340
European powers,
we may indeed be proud;

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.224
we may indeed be proud of the
colonial work which France has

00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:20.590
performed."
What was there to be proud of?

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.521
Again, this idea of national
expansion and national

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:27.039
greatness, intimately tied to
the perceived positive benefits

00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:29.559
of bringing French civilization
abroad.

00:35:29.559 --> 00:35:32.057
A member of the Chamber of
Deputies in fact answered this

00:35:32.057 --> 00:35:33.929
question, what was there to be
proud of?

00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:38.059
Quote: "What nobler or more
inspiring work could one find?

00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:41.642
Colonizing means coming in
touch with new races and

00:35:41.642 --> 00:35:44.508
civilizations,
and it means achieving the

00:35:44.508 --> 00:35:48.604
noblest type of fellowship,
for any form of colonization

00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:52.420
which did not successfully seek
to increase the dignity,

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.946
the moral standards,
and the wellbeing of the

00:35:54.946 --> 00:35:58.046
colonized people would be
uncivilized and unworthy of a

00:35:58.046 --> 00:36:00.829
great nation,"
end quote.

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:06.489
Of course, not all was well in
the empire.

00:36:06.489 --> 00:36:10.359
I've focused in this lecture so
far on the place of the empire

00:36:10.359 --> 00:36:12.579
in domestic politics and
culture.

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:15.838
So, I haven't spoken all that
much about the effect that

00:36:15.838 --> 00:36:19.630
French colonization had on the
lives of those in the colonies.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.046
Needless to say,
the realities of empire did not

00:36:23.046 --> 00:36:27.044
often coincide with Jules
Ferry's promises to spread the

00:36:27.044 --> 00:36:31.050
best of French civilization,
nor did it coincide with the

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.469
caricature of the smiling,
graceful African in the popular

00:36:34.469 --> 00:36:37.829
press or on the front of the
Banania box on the breakfast

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:39.766
table.
Empire, of course,

00:36:39.766 --> 00:36:42.389
was much more complicated than
that.

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:46.591
Few people accepted the rise of
French power without a struggle,

00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:50.059
but few could match the
technological advantages then

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:53.260
enjoyed by the French military
and the navy.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.738
As the French Empire spread,
soldiers and sailors put down

00:36:56.738 --> 00:36:59.179
one resistance movement after
another,

00:36:59.179 --> 00:37:02.495
usually with uncompromising
brutality and often with very

00:37:02.495 --> 00:37:04.883
high death tolls.
As French colonial

00:37:04.883 --> 00:37:06.989
administrations,
legal systems,

00:37:06.989 --> 00:37:10.429
police forces,
replaced the army and the navy,

00:37:10.429 --> 00:37:13.326
military repression,
what had been military

00:37:13.326 --> 00:37:17.119
repression, took more the
character of an occupation,

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:20.776
dressed up as integration,
the integration of the colonies

00:37:20.776 --> 00:37:24.011
into the French nation.
French structures of authority

00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:26.840
enforced inequality between
French and other races,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.276
and justified the exploitation
of resources and the political

00:37:30.276 --> 00:37:33.769
repression that really were the
realities of everyday life,

00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:36.619
for most of the French colonial
subjects.

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:41.124
Cracks--by 1914,
however, cracks began to appear

00:37:41.124 --> 00:37:44.715
in this edifice.
Not everybody had been swept up

00:37:44.715 --> 00:37:48.205
by France's colonial dreams,
and as the realities of empire

00:37:48.205 --> 00:37:51.755
became more and more apparent a
small anti-colonial lobby in

00:37:51.755 --> 00:37:55.235
France began to grow.
Like their counterparts in the

00:37:55.235 --> 00:37:57.790
colonial lobby,
anti-colonialists opposed

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.599
French expansion for a number of
reasons.

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:03.254
For some people,
French colonial adventures

00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:06.539
seemed a dangerous
over-extension of French power.

00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:10.458
Some people wondered how useful
these dense jungles and barren

00:38:10.458 --> 00:38:12.900
deserts could possibly be to
France,

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.156
especially when it became clear
that a lot of the financial

00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:19.469
returns on colonial expansion
that had been expected did not

00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:21.940
come to match these initial
projections.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.009
Some people began to criticize
colonial expansion for moral

00:38:26.009 --> 00:38:29.727
reasons, protesting the growing
incidences of colonial

00:38:29.727 --> 00:38:32.177
barbarity.
To give one example,

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:36.285
at one public protest in 1906
the famous intellectual and

00:38:36.285 --> 00:38:39.000
novelist Anatole France
thundered,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.241
quote, "whites do not
communicate with blacks or

00:38:42.241 --> 00:38:45.690
yellow people except to enserf
or massacre them.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:49.895
The people whom we call
barbarians know us only through

00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:53.115
our own crimes.
It is our responsibility as

00:38:53.115 --> 00:38:57.397
Frenchmen to denounce the crimes
being committed in our name,"

00:38:57.397 --> 00:38:59.481
end quote.
Jean Jaurès,

00:38:59.481 --> 00:39:02.809
the leader of the Socialist
party, went even further.

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:05.525
Refuting the myth of the
civilizing mission of the

00:39:05.525 --> 00:39:08.239
mission civilisatrice,
in this case in Morocco,

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:11.113
Jaurès said,
quote, "there existed before

00:39:11.113 --> 00:39:14.597
the French takeover a Moroccan
civilization capable of the

00:39:14.597 --> 00:39:18.341
necessary transformation,
capable of evolution and

00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:22.449
progress, a civilization both
ancient and modern.

00:39:22.449 --> 00:39:25.699
And there was a seed for the
future, there was a hope.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:29.387
And let me say that I cannot
pardon those who have crushed

00:39:29.387 --> 00:39:32.170
this hope for pacific and human
progress,

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.355
African civilization,
by all sorts of ruses and by

00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:38.909
the brutality of conquest,"
end quote.

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:42.735
During the 1920s and 1930s,
anti-colonialism would become a

00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:45.440
more powerful force in French
politics,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.215
grouping together some
socialists and communists,

00:39:48.215 --> 00:39:50.989
some voices within the French
Catholic Church,

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:54.002
journalists and writers,
and a number of intellectuals

00:39:54.002 --> 00:39:57.089
and avant-garde artists,
the latter of whom would

00:39:57.089 --> 00:39:59.905
famously organize an
anti-colonial counter-

00:39:59.905 --> 00:40:03.594
exposition during the famous
1931 Colonial Exposition in

00:40:03.594 --> 00:40:07.212
Vincennes.
In 1900 in Paris there had been

00:40:07.212 --> 00:40:10.329
no similar anti-colonial
exposition.

00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:12.851
However, and I want to
underscore this,

00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:16.301
it was not the French
themselves who would eventually

00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:19.884
succeed in crumbling the
imperial edifice built over so

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:23.656
many generations.
When the French colonial empire

00:40:23.656 --> 00:40:27.860
eventually expired in 1962,
when the French left Algeria,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.911
it did so first and foremost
because of the many forms of

00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:34.399
resistance organized and carried
out by those who lived under its

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:36.341
yoke.
That's another topic for

00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:38.941
another lecture,
but what I want to say here

00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:42.569
sort of in conclusion is that
the First World War was in many

00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:46.559
ways the beginning of the end
for the French colonial empire.

00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:49.596
It was a tipping point,
after which these myths

00:40:49.596 --> 00:40:53.160
underpinning French rule were no
longer sustainable.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.959
They'd been very powerful myths.
Before World War I,

00:40:56.959 --> 00:41:00.435
many in the colonized world had
actually asked themselves

00:41:00.435 --> 00:41:03.848
whether French civilization
might in fact be superior to

00:41:03.848 --> 00:41:06.099
their own.
The French had arrived with

00:41:06.099 --> 00:41:09.033
technological advantages that
many in the colonized world did

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.137
not have,
and they had achieved military

00:41:11.137 --> 00:41:13.159
and political control with few
numbers.

00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:16.213
For some people it did seem for
a time that what the French were

00:41:16.213 --> 00:41:18.539
saying about the mission
civilisatrice,

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:22.090
the civilizing mission,
might actually in fact be true.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:27.090
But for many of these people
World War I was a revelation.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.925
During the war,
nearly half a million colonial

00:41:29.925 --> 00:41:32.949
subjects were conscripted or
even volunteered,

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:35.507
and many of them did,
to don a blue uniform of

00:41:35.507 --> 00:41:38.349
the poilu and to
fight for France.

00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:42.157
Many others came to the
metropole to work in shipyards

00:41:42.157 --> 00:41:45.842
or in factories.
Those who came saw poverty,

00:41:45.842 --> 00:41:50.626
they saw deep rifts in French
society over the place of

00:41:50.626 --> 00:41:52.721
religion,
over politics,

00:41:52.721 --> 00:41:56.700
and most importantly they saw
their omnipotent colonial

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.311
masters in a war that was
literally ripping French

00:42:00.311 --> 00:42:03.568
civilization apart.
Although those who came to

00:42:03.568 --> 00:42:06.717
France to fight or to work were
a very small minority of

00:42:06.717 --> 00:42:09.719
Colonial subjects,
the echoes of the guns of

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:13.282
August reverberated worldwide;
and for countless people

00:42:13.282 --> 00:42:16.389
throughout the Empire the Great
War showed that France,

00:42:16.389 --> 00:42:19.119
for all its power,
did not and could not

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:21.849
correspond to its own colonial
myths.

00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:27.181
"In the minds of other races,"
would write the Governor General

00:42:27.181 --> 00:42:30.815
of Indochina in 1931,
"in the minds of other races

00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:34.067
the war dealt a terrible blow to
the moral standing of a

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:37.142
civilization which Europeans
claimed with pride to be

00:42:37.142 --> 00:42:39.954
superior,
yet in whose name Europeans

00:42:39.954 --> 00:42:44.070
spent more than four years
savagely killing each other.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.630
Europe's prestige had been
greatly compromised.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:51.964
It has long been commonplace to
contrast European greatness with

00:42:51.964 --> 00:42:56.860
Asian or African decadence.
The contrast now seems to be

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.752
reversed."
Indeed empire would have a very

00:42:59.752 --> 00:43:02.862
different relationship to
national identity in the years

00:43:02.862 --> 00:43:05.873
after World War I.
For growing numbers of people

00:43:05.873 --> 00:43:09.960
in France, empire slowly came to
seem too difficult to maintain,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.273
too expensive,
especially during the lean

00:43:12.273 --> 00:43:14.530
years of the Depression in the
1930s,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.280
and perhaps,
for many, even immoral.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.066
What had been a point of
unification in France slowly

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:26.289
turned into a source for
political and cultural tension.

00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:30.470
But the opposite was true of
the places that France had

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.346
colonized.
Indeed, during the 1920s and

00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:37.380
1930s national identities would
be formed outside France,

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.993
throughout the French empire,
in opposition to the French

00:43:39.993 --> 00:43:42.495
colonial project,
as anti-colonial activists laid

00:43:42.495 --> 00:43:45.361
the roots for liberation
movements that would ultimately

00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:48.383
tear down the French colonial
empire in the years after the

00:43:48.383 --> 00:43:50.759
Second World War;
and that's a subject for

00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:56.000
another lecture.
Thanks very much.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.623
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This is a

00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:00.976
relatively simple topic.
In fact, any of you who took

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.312
any kind of high school physics,
you would have done this thing

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:05.120
with fluids.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.300
So, this is the subject for
today.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.347
Fluid dynamics and statics.
So, I'll start with the simple

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:21.309
static problem.
We are going to take--Whenever

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:25.780
I say fluid, you are free to
imagine water or oil.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.939
That's the--that's a good
enough example of a fluid.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.178
One important property of the
fluid, the density,

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:37.040
denoted by ρ;
the density of water I would

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590
probably note by a subscript
w.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.510
And you know that's mass per
unit volume.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:53.010
For water that happens to be
1,000 kilograms per cubic meter.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.513
So, let's not linger there.
I think that's a fairly simple

00:01:56.513 --> 00:01:58.200
concept.
The more subtle concept is the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.790
one of pressure.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.576
So, you have the notion of a
pressure if you go in a swimming

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:08.682
pool and you dive down to the
bottom, you know,

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:10.961
the pressure is going up.
So, what's the formal

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:12.810
definition of pressure?
Is it a vector?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.510
Is it a scale?
Or does it have magnitude?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.769
Does it have a direction?
That's what I want to explain

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.307
to you.
So, you can pick a point on the

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:22.270
fluid, there,
and say the pressure there is

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.500
such and such.
But what do we mean by that?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.398
We mean by that the following.
If you get into that fluid and

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:32.319
you want to carve out a little
space for yourself,

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.621
you know, make a little cube,
maybe a glass cube,

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.539
and you want to live inside
that cube.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.280
So, I'm going to blow up the
cube like this.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.941
The water is trying to push you
in from all sides and compress

00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.155
this cube.
You therefore have to push out

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:55.692
on the two, on all the walls.
If the force you exert on this

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:59.946
wall is some F and the
area of that wall is A,

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.469
that ratio is called a
pressure.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.382
So, pressure is an intensive
measure of how hard the water is

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:10.467
trying to push in.
If you don't put the cube,

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:13.528
that pressure is still there,
but one way to measure the

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:16.812
pressure is to try to go in
there and push the fluid out and

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:21.420
ask how hard does it push you.
And the unit for pressure

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.232
Newton per meters square--and we
use another name for that called

00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:31.658
a Pascal.
One Pascal is one Newton per

00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:34.224
meter squared.
Here's another example of

00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:36.129
pressure.
You have a gas.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.160
We'll do a lot of this after
the break.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.450
There is a gas inside a
cylinder.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.183
There's a piston.
Now, if the pressure of the gas

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.010
and the pressure of the outside
world are the same,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.008
there's nothing you have to do,
assuming the piston is

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.601
massless.
But if you want to increase the

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:56.389
pressure in the gas,
you put some extra weight.

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.481
That mg will push down,
and mg divided by the

00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.289
area of the piston will be extra
pressure you apply.

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.009
That's also the pressure of the
gas.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.254
That pressure is the
atmospheric pressure,

00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:15.843
plus the extra weight you
apply, divided by the area of

00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:19.057
this piston.
The atmospheric pressure is

00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:21.589
everywhere.
So, when you push down on the

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.394
piston here to compress the gas
further, you're adding to the

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:29.009
atmospheric pressure this extra
force divided by area.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.429
Sometimes--I mean,
this is called the absolute

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.298
pressure.
And that's called the

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:40.387
atmospheric pressure,
and that's called the gauge

00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:42.843
pressure.
So, the gauge pressure is the

00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:44.870
pressure on top of atmospheric
pressure.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.255
For example,
when your car has a flat,

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:50.995
the bright side of it is the
pressure inside the tire is in

00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:53.509
fact equal to atmospheric
pressure.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.822
It doesn't help you because
there's a pressure inside and

00:04:55.822 --> 00:04:58.339
there's a pressure outside,
and if you want to keep your

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.072
car moving, you really have to
increase the pressure in the

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:02.840
tire.
And when you stick this gauge

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.479
in and you measure something,
32 pounds per square inch,

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.244
that's the gauge pressure.
That's in excess of the

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:12.227
atmospheric pressure.
So, you should understand that

00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:17.828
the pressure is a condition in a
fluid, and one of the important

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:22.016
properties of pressure,
is that if you took a fluid and

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:25.588
you went to a certain height,
all points at that height have

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:28.918
the same pressure.
And we understand that as

00:05:28.918 --> 00:05:30.920
follows.
So, I go to this fluid.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.014
I imagine in my mind a little
cylindrical section of the same

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:40.628
fluid.
Just draw a dotted line around

00:05:40.628 --> 00:05:44.019
that region and focus on that
little chunk of fluid and say,

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.819
"Can the pressure on the two
sides -- this face and that face

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.490
-- be different?"
The answer is "no."

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.518
Because if the pressure on the
left was bigger than the

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:57.212
pressure on the right,
I take a cylinder of some area

00:05:57.212 --> 00:06:00.856
A, pressure times area on
the left will exceed pressure

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:03.020
time area on the right.
And therefore,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.590
the fluid should move to the
right.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.996
But it's not doing anything.
It's in equilibrium,

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:09.721
and the only way that can
happen is if it's pushed equally

00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:12.887
from both sides.
So, notice that the pressure on

00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:17.256
this chunk from the left points
this way, and then that chunk

00:06:17.256 --> 00:06:20.139
points that way.
They're trying to push it in.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.660
So, pressure cannot change at a
given depth.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.867
But let's take a cylinder that
looks like this [draws on

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:32.018
board].
Remember this is not a real

00:06:32.018 --> 00:06:34.322
cylinder.
This is the same water,

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:36.975
and mentally,
I have isolated a part of the

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:39.250
water that looks like a
cylinder;

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.259
maybe you want to draw it in
dotted lines.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.029
But it's just a fluid of
cylindrical shape,

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.709
base area A and height
h.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.829
I can ask the following
question.

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:55.822
Let's say h_1
is the measure of that one from

00:06:55.822 --> 00:06:58.637
the surface, and
h_2 is the

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:02.629
depth from the surface to the
lower face of the cylinder.

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.886
We can now argue the pressure
in the top and bottom really

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:10.287
should not be equal.
You should think about it,

00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:14.139
by the same argument I gave
earlier will tell me it cannot

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.426
be equal.
If they were equal,

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:20.854
since these two areas are
equal, the forces pushing up and

00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:24.120
pushing down will cancel.
With no net force on the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.757
cylinder, you can ask then,
"What's keeping the cylinder of

00:07:26.757 --> 00:07:30.085
water from falling down?"
Well, there has to be a force

00:07:30.085 --> 00:07:32.779
to equal the weight of that
cylinder.

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:35.750
Therefore, there has to be a
net upward force.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.796
That means the pressure down
here, pushing up,

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:39.980
better be higher than the
pressure on the top.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.879
We are now going to calculate
what the pressure difference is.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:47.717
So, let's call the pressure
downstairs P_2

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.100
and upstairs
P_1.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.892
So, the upward force is
P_1

00:07:51.892 --> 00:07:53.977
[correction: should have said
P_2]

00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:55.652
times A.
The downward force is

00:07:55.652 --> 00:07:57.712
P_2
[correction: should have said

00:07:57.712 --> 00:07:59.100
P_1]
times A.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.644
That's the net upward force.
That's got to be equal to the

00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:07.328
weight of that amount of water.
The weight is found by first

00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:11.773
the mass, which is area times
h_2 -

00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:15.310
h_1.
That's the volume of the

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.993
cylinder, times the density of
water or whatever fluid you

00:08:18.993 --> 00:08:20.790
have.
That's the mass of the cylinder.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.980
That's the weight of that
cylinder of liquid.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.158
All I have done is balance the
gravitational force on this

00:08:30.158 --> 00:08:33.510
cylinder with the net upward
force due to the different

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.210
pressures.
I think I made one mistake here.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.236
Upward force,
in magnitude--I want to write

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:43.633
this P_2 times
A, and downward force I

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:46.659
want to write as
P_1.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.150
How we keep track of signs is a
little subtle.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.534
I'm balancing two magnitudes.
I'm balancing net upward force,

00:08:52.534 --> 00:08:55.649
namely P_2 is
considered positive upward,

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:57.890
and this is the force of
gravity down.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.549
I'm balancing the magnitudes.
So, the area cancels out.

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:06.401
Because this area -- see the
pressure between two points --

00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:10.850
should not depend on the area of
this fictitious cylinder I took.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.510
In fact, I find it is equal to
ρg times

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.592
h_2 -
h_1,

00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:19.120
which is the difference in the
depth of these two points.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.283
Yes?
Student: It's actually

00:09:21.283 --> 00:09:22.475
like a [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:23.911
Shankar: Which one?
Student: [inaudible]

00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:24.940
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.879
In fact, it really happens to
be normal, or perpendicular to

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.819
area because the pressure will
push straight up and straight

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:34.863
down.
How about forces on the sides

00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:37.730
of cylinder?
They cancel at every height.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.861
Because at every height the
push from the left and right are

00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:41.750
equal;
I already showed you that.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.279
So, for the mechanical
stability of this chunk,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.370
I need all forces to add up to
zero.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.738
Horizontally,
there is no gravity and the

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.870
pressure at every height is
equal.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.730
So, that cancels out.
Vertically, there is the force

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.080
of gravity, and it's cancelled
by the difference in pressure.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.677
So, we can see that
P_2 =

00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:05.441
P_1 plus
ρg times the height

00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:10.026
difference.
And people write this formula

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.237
as follows.
It's very standard to take

00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:17.590
P_1 to be the
point right at the surface,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.198
and P_2 to be
any point inside,

00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:23.029
and to call the depth of that
simply as h.

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:30.413
Then the pressure at the point
P in the fluid is the

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:36.523
pressure at the top,
which is usually atmospheric

00:10:36.523 --> 00:10:41.013
pressure, plus ρgh.
So, I don't have an

00:10:41.013 --> 00:10:42.586
h_1 and an
h_2 because

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:43.929
h_1 I've chosen
to be zero.

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:46.530
And h_2 I'm
simply calling h.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.206
This says something very simple.
If you go to a lake,

00:10:50.206 --> 00:10:52.825
at the surface of the lake the
pressure is due to the

00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:54.519
atmosphere.
You take a dive,

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:57.736
you go down some depth
h, the pressure goes up

00:10:57.736 --> 00:11:00.816
by this amount.
Now, if you go to the bottom of

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:04.750
the ocean, it's going to be an
incredible amount of pressure.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.785
That's why you and I cannot
survive in the bottom of the

00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:10.711
ocean, because the outside
pressure -- inside is usual

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.857
atmospheric pressure -- you're
breathing the air into your

00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:15.480
lungs,
you go down with that.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.039
Outside is atmospheric plus
this, and that can kill you.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:21.436
That's why when you build a
submarine, you've got to make

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:23.019
sure it can withstand the
pressure.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:26.037
But fish don't have the
problem, because fish are

00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:29.141
breathing the water.
The water is going into their

00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:33.080
system and outside their system.
So, that's one way for you to

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.360
live.
If you're 20,000 feet under the

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.225
sea, start drinking the water.
But it's not a long-term

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:40.162
solution.
It'll work in the short time

00:11:40.162 --> 00:11:42.500
because you'll be equalizing the
pressure.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.120
Okay.
Now, how about the atmospheric

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.409
pressure?
What's the origin of that?

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:53.852
And the origin of the
atmospheric pressure is that we

00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:57.612
are ourselves living in the
bottom of a pool,

00:11:57.612 --> 00:12:02.390
but it's filled with air.
The air above our heads goes on

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.803
for maybe 100 miles,
but the density decreases,

00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:09.106
eventually vanishes.
So, I cannot tell you precisely

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:11.990
where the atmosphere ends,
but I can say the following.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.847
If I go far above where the
absolute pressure is zero,

00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:18.539
in free space there is just
vacuum.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.799
The pressure here is the
atmospheric pressure.

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:28.168
Atmospheric pressure at the
bottom of Earth is equal to zero

00:12:28.168 --> 00:12:32.252
plus ρgh,
where ρ is the density

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:36.180
of air, g is g,
and h is the height of

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.383
the atmosphere.
And that happens to be 10^(5)

00:12:40.383 --> 00:12:41.310
Pascals.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.644
So, we are living in the bottom
of a pool where the pressure is

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.737
10^(5) Pascals,
relative to empty

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:54.398
space--interstellar space.
But as I said,

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:57.491
that pressure doesn't kills us
because the pressure can be felt

00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:00.533
both from the outside pushing in
and inside going through your

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:03.740
nostrils and everything else,
pushing out.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.308
But you have all seen the
dramatic experiment where you

00:13:06.308 --> 00:13:09.400
take a can of something and you
heat it up so the air goes out;

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.191
then you seal it.
The air that's been driven out

00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:16.175
reduces the pressure.
So, when you seal it and you

00:13:16.175 --> 00:13:18.149
cool it, then the pressure
drops.

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:20.406
And even the drop in
pressure--it doesn't even drop

00:13:20.406 --> 00:13:22.211
down to zero,
but it's big enough for the

00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:23.340
while can to implode.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.910
Now, let's see what you get
here.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.835
Let's do the following.
This is ρgh,

00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:36.519
and you can ask yourself the
following question.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:40.269
If this was a swimming pool,
how high would the water be?

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:43.253
In other words,
what height of water above the

00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:47.429
Earth would produce the same
pressure as our atmosphere does?

00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:52.022
Then I say, if I want 10^(5)
Pascals, that's the density of

00:13:52.022 --> 00:13:55.506
water at 10^(3),
g, let's pretend it's

00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:57.703
ten.
And h is what I'm

00:13:57.703 --> 00:14:00.930
looking for.
Cancel all the powers of 10;

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.212
h is like 10 meters.
And it turns out it's -- to the

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:08.769
best of my knowledge -- it's 32
feet.

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:11.938
These are the units we don't
use in the book,

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:15.539
but it's a very common way of
thinking, 32 feet.

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.769
So, we are at the bottom of a
pool.

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:20.500
If it was filled with water,
it would be 32 feet of water.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.198
Alright.
So, now we are going to take

00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:27.675
this formula P =
P_0 + ρgh and put

00:14:27.675 --> 00:14:30.240
it to work.
Get some mileage out of that.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.000
So, what are the things we can
do with that formula?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.740
First thing you can do is to
build yourself a barometer.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.429
Barometer you know is a way to
tell what the pressure is today.

00:14:44.429 --> 00:14:47.252
Now, the atmospheric pressure,
when I said it's 10^(5),

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:50.250
that's the typical pressure.
It doesn't really stay locked

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.620
into the value.
Each day there are fluctuations.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.998
That's why the weather person
tells you pressure is going up,

00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:58.155
pressure is going down.
So, let's find a way to measure

00:14:58.155 --> 00:15:01.370
the pressure,
and here is one way to do that.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:09.062
You take a can of something,
fill it with some liquid,

00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:13.678
take a test tube.
Evacuate it completely,

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:17.799
suck all the air out of it and
stick it into this.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:20.829
When you do,
there is a complete vacuum here

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:25.057
and the atmosphere is pushing
down, so the fluid will rise up

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:28.608
to some height h.
And you can ask,

00:15:28.608 --> 00:15:32.070
"How high will it go?
What's going to be the height?"

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.977
Well, it'll go to a height so
that zero pressure here,

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:40.651
plus this ρgh,
which is the pressure there,

00:15:40.651 --> 00:15:42.568
will be the same as the
pressure here,

00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:45.159
because they are two points at
the same height.

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:48.100
Pressure here is the
atmospheric pressure.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.100
So pressure here,
atmospheric pressure,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.470
is zero at the top of the tube,
plus ρgh.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.165
So, if you build this gadget,
this barometer out of water,

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:08.789
the water column will rise to
the height of 32 feet.

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:12.344
But now, nobody wants a gadget
32-feet high,

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:16.643
so what you use instead is
mercury, because it's very

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.620
dense.
So, you want to get the same

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.675
atmospheric pressure,
but you want to have a bigger

00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:22.320
ρ and get a smaller
h.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.781
If you go look up a book and
find the density of mercury,

00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:28.810
you're going to find the height
is something like,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.159
I don't know,
750,780 millimeters.

00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:35.493
That's why the weather guy says
the pressure today is so many

00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:38.600
millimeters, and the mercury is
dropping.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.058
Now, I'm not sure why they
bother to give the numbers,

00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:42.727
because for most of us,
including me,

00:16:42.727 --> 00:16:44.490
those numbers don't mean
anything.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.410
Here's a number,
746 millimeters.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.029
Does it speak to you?
Not to me.

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:53.529
So it--it speaks to one of you
guys?

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:57.173
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:16:57.173 --> 00:16:59.550
Shankar: Yeah.
Okay.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.698
Some number.
It's not like saying today is

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:05.908
67 degree Fahrenheit.
I guess I know what that means,

00:17:05.908 --> 00:17:08.832
but when I hear the mercury,
I think it's just a waste of

00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:11.467
time.
Anyway, they're telling you how

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:13.849
much the mercury is.
Okay?

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.607
You can use any fluid you like,
but you've got to agree on

00:17:16.607 --> 00:17:18.930
using mercury because if it's
760 millimeters,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.781
and it's water the person is
talking about,

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:22.500
of course you are in serious
trouble.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.029
So understood,
we're talking about mercury.

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:27.990
Also, mercury is used in
thermometers.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.720
That's the subject for after
the break.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.535
So there, the mercury falling
could stand for falling

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.485
temperatures and rising
temperatures,

00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:37.680
but here it's for falling
pressure and rising pressure.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.707
So, this is the first gadget
you can build with what I've

00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:43.585
taught you.
The next gadget you can build

00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:47.109
is--you can imagine this--you
trying to drink.

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:50.039
This is your ears and nose and
what not.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.210
You've got a straw and you're
trying to drink something.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.750
Now, remember the fluid is
water.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.257
Okay?
It's not mercury now,

00:17:56.257 --> 00:17:57.869
because you're doing different
experiment.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.480
You're going to drink from a
straw.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.806
So, how do you do that?
You know when you drink from a

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:05.430
straw you create a partial
vacuum in your mouth.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:12.049
So, the pressure here--;So,
in the case of the fluid that

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:16.660
you want to drink,
this is your head.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.740
The pressure here less than the
atmosphere.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.918
If it's less than the
atmosphere by some amount,

00:18:24.918 --> 00:18:28.569
then the fluid can start
climbing up to some height,

00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:32.095
and climb to such a height so
that the lower pressure,

00:18:32.095 --> 00:18:35.819
plus that ρgh will
equal atmospheric pressure.

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:39.368
So, you got to reduce the
pressure more and more in your

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.819
mouth until this fluid can climb
up.

00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:44.483
If you just--if you want to
just make it to your mouth,

00:18:44.483 --> 00:18:47.690
it depends on the length of the
straw, the height of the straw.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.912
If you want to suck it up a
certain height,

00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:53.137
then that height,
ρgh,

00:18:53.137 --> 00:18:55.900
plus the pressure in your
mouth,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.170
is the pressure here,
and that's the atmospheric

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.424
pressure.
So, if you want to drink water

00:19:03.424 --> 00:19:08.309
from a well that is more than 32
feet deep, you are out of luck.

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:11.361
Even if your face and your head
are a complete vacuum,

00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:14.470
you cannot get the water to
climb more than 32 feet.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.059
So, that's another illustration
of this.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:25.118
So, one more example of this
P = P_0 + ρgh,

00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:30.102
is if I give you another fluid,
it doesn't mix with water and I

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.660
tell you find the density,
there are many ways.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.839
One is to just find mass and
volume of that fluid and divide.

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:38.930
But here is another thing
people use.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.260
You take what's called a U-tube.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.779
Yeah, that's not--I know,
that's where they post all the

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:51.195
embarrassing videos,
but this was physics

00:19:51.195 --> 00:19:55.460
contribution to pop culture long
before any of this happened.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.168
This is the U-tube.
And the U-tube,

00:19:58.168 --> 00:20:03.804
let's say you fill it up with
one fluid and this is the other

00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:05.596
fluid.
So, this is oil,

00:20:05.596 --> 00:20:06.720
and this is water.

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:13.005
If the two heights were equal,
then you know we're talking

00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:15.957
about the same fluid.
But this is supposed to tell

00:20:15.957 --> 00:20:20.512
you that oil is less dense than
water, and we can check that by

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:24.700
comparing two points in this
fluid at the same height,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.680
and saying the pressure must be
the same at those points.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.410
You understand how I get that?
That pressure and that pressure

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.281
are equal because you can draw a
cylinder there horizontally,

00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:39.539
which cannot be pushed
sideways.

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:42.385
From here, to this pressure add
that ρgh and that

00:20:42.385 --> 00:20:44.519
ρgh, and you come to
that point;

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:46.680
you conclude that pressure is
also equal.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.208
You cannot jump into the new
fluid here because the ρ

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:51.400
for here and the ρ for
this are different.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.601
But these two points have the
same pressure and they are in

00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:57.415
the same fluid.
So, let me write that statement

00:20:57.415 --> 00:21:00.802
that this pressure and this
pressure are equal by saying,

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.130
atmospheric pressure is on the
top for both of them.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:08.703
That, plus ρ_1gh
_1 is equal to

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:12.329
atmospheric pressure plus
ρ_2,

00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:15.605
gh_2,
where this is the second fluid

00:21:15.605 --> 00:21:18.279
, height goes to
h_2,

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.511
first fluid,
the height is equal to

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.887
h_1,
the densities are

00:21:20.887 --> 00:21:22.769
ρ_1 and
ρ_2.

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:24.829
Atmospheric pressure is
cancelled;

00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:28.934
then you find
h_1/h_2 =

00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:32.309
ρ_2/ρ
_1.

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:35.616
So, by comparing the heights
you can find the relative

00:21:35.616 --> 00:21:38.201
density.
If one of them is water,

00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:41.484
then, well, whatever it is.
If you know the density of one

00:21:41.484 --> 00:21:43.010
fluid, you can find the density
of the other.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:51.667
Okay, yet another application
of this law that the pressure is

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:55.859
equal at a given height is the
famous hydraulic press.

00:21:55.859 --> 00:22:03.829
So, here is a--Here are two
pistons of different radii.

00:22:03.829 --> 00:22:05.680
This has got cross section area
A_1;

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.039
this has got cross section area
A_2.

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:16.450
And here I want to put some
incompressible fluid.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.056
Incompressible fluid is
something whose volume cannot be

00:22:20.056 --> 00:22:22.809
changed no matter how much you
press it.

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:25.339
Now, water is pretty close to
incompressible.

00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:28.310
It does have a compressibility,
but it's not going to change

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.142
very much for our purposes.
So now here,

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:36.059
I have a piston,
and I have a piston here.

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:39.299
And I push down here with a
force F_1,

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:42.240
and I ask, "What will I get at
the other side?"

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.165
You might think
F_1 =

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:49.210
F_2,
but since these fluids are at

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.113
the same height,
we only know P_1 =

00:22:52.113 --> 00:22:53.984
P_2.
That means

00:22:53.984 --> 00:22:56.983
F_1/A_1 =
F_2/A&lt;

00:22:56.983 --> 00:23:00.530
sub&gt;2.
So, this fluid here will push

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.867
up here with a force
F_2,

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:07.367
which is equal to
F_1 times

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:11.600
A_2 over
A_1.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.990
Did I get it right?
Ah.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.208
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:22.338
Shankar: Pardon me.
Student: [inaudible]

00:23:22.338 --> 00:23:23.190
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Did I make a

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.817
mistake here?
Student: [inaudible]

00:23:25.817 --> 00:23:29.972
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: But I want to

00:23:29.972 --> 00:23:32.870
amplify the force.
So, what do we really want to

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.281
do?
Well, it's a matter of who you

00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:36.220
want to emphasize.
So, what you want to emphasize

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.461
here--Maybe if I drew a picture
I will know exactly what I'm

00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:40.319
trying to do.
This picture is fine.

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:41.890
In practice,
this is not what you do.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.069
You want to push down here and
raise something there.

00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:47.950
Because what you really imagine
is some elephant.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.133
There's an elephant standing
here, and you want to lift the

00:23:51.133 --> 00:23:53.109
elephant by applying a force
here.

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:56.118
So, let's still call your force
F_2,

00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:59.531
and the force on the other side
is the force you apply times

00:23:59.531 --> 00:24:02.250
A_1
/A_2.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.757
So A_1
/A_2 could

00:24:03.757 --> 00:24:05.839
be a hundred.
What that means is,

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:10.986
if you apply one Newton here,
you'll get a hundred Newtons on

00:24:10.986 --> 00:24:14.163
the other side.
So, that's the way to max--to

00:24:14.163 --> 00:24:16.529
convert a small force into a
large force.

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.849
But this is the oldest trick in
the book.

00:24:18.849 --> 00:24:24.024
An even older one invented by
cave people, is that if you have

00:24:24.024 --> 00:24:28.180
a support like this you can put
a weight here and,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.980
uh, let me see,
that's right.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.339
So, a tiny weight here can lift
a big weight here because that

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:37.533
mg times that distance
and this mg times this

00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:40.933
distance will be equal.
But you must know even from

00:24:40.933 --> 00:24:44.829
that example that you don't get
something for nothing.

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:47.477
In other words,
if you lift the elephant here

00:24:47.477 --> 00:24:50.545
by pushing down here,
the fact that the forces don't

00:24:50.545 --> 00:24:53.928
match is perfectly okay.
But the work you do here must

00:24:53.928 --> 00:24:56.329
be the work delivered to the
other side.

00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:57.970
The Law of Conservation of
Energy.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.416
The work you do on this side is
the force multiplied by the

00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:03.260
distance.

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:10.565
Now, force multiplied by
distance I'm going to write as

00:25:10.565 --> 00:25:13.226
the pressure times the cross
section area,

00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:16.059
times distance.
But what is A

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:20.619
times--A_2
times dX_2?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.578
A_2 times
dX_2--if you

00:25:23.578 --> 00:25:26.107
push the liquid here--if you
moved it a distance

00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:27.998
ΔX_2,
area times

00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:30.539
ΔX_2 is the
volume of fluid you push down

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:32.222
here.
That's the volume that'll come

00:25:32.222 --> 00:25:34.679
up on the other side.
So, you're free to write that

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.976
as P_2 times
A_1

00:25:36.976 --> 00:25:38.150
ΔX_1.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.301
Okay, but P_2A
_1--I'm sorry,

00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:51.984
yes, now, let's write
P_2 is the same

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:53.930
as P_1.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:00.604
P_1 times
A_1 is

00:26:00.604 --> 00:26:01.470
F_1.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.267
So, it just says that the force
times distance on one side is

00:26:08.267 --> 00:26:10.769
the force times distance on the
other side.

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:13.803
That means the work you
actually do is not amplified by

00:26:13.803 --> 00:26:16.116
the process.
You cannot get more joules out

00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:18.890
of one side by any device.
What you put in is what you'll

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.720
get out.
But still it's useful,

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.437
because in practice you may
have to move a whole meter here

00:26:24.437 --> 00:26:27.130
to lift the elephant by one
centimeter.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.541
But the point is,
you can lift elephants this

00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:31.099
way.
That's the important thing.

00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:33.410
Okay, that's why it's worth
doing.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.289
And this is how you--the brake
in your car works.

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:38.960
You know, you pump the brake
pedal.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.065
There's a little cylinder there
and there's a fluid there,

00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:44.190
and the fluid is pushed by your
feet.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.390
And you push it quite a bit,
several centimeters.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.556
At the other end,
there's another cylinder whose

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:53.790
piston is right next to the drum
that's rotating,

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.383
and pushes on the drum.
And it exerts an enormous

00:26:57.383 --> 00:27:00.220
amount of force,
but it moves a very tiny

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.113
amount.
The shoes that grab your

00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:04.382
rotating drum move a very tiny
amount, whereas,

00:27:04.382 --> 00:27:08.190
your feet move a large amount.
But that's the ratio of the

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.700
force that's transmitted.
The fluid has the same pressure.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.507
The brake fluid has the same
pressure, but the force you

00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:17.545
apply with your feet is much,
much smaller than the force

00:27:17.545 --> 00:27:20.833
that the drum will exert on the
rotating--that the disc brakes

00:27:20.833 --> 00:27:25.799
will exert on the rotating drum.
So, a lot of hydraulics is

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:31.130
based on this simple
amplification of force.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.126
Alright.
Now, I move to the next topic

00:27:35.126 --> 00:27:38.973
in this field,
which is the Archimedes'

00:27:38.973 --> 00:27:43.170
principle.
So, we all know the conditions

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:48.382
under which this was discovered.
So, I will not go into that,

00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:52.467
other than to say that Mr.
Archimedes noticed that if you

00:27:52.467 --> 00:27:56.480
immerse something in a fluid it
seems to weigh less.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.788
What I mean by that is that if
you attached it to some kind of

00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:04.212
a spring balance,
and you weighed it so that the

00:28:04.212 --> 00:28:08.170
kx of the spring was the
mg of the object,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.200
and if you did the same thing
now you will find it seems to

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.499
weigh less.
And the question was,

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:16.140
"How much less?"
Archimedes' answer is very

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.963
simple.
The amount by which you lose

00:28:19.963 --> 00:28:27.035
the weight, or the weight loss,
equals the weight of liquid

00:28:27.035 --> 00:28:28.620
displaced.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.150
Now, how do you show that?
Because we don't,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.799
right now, so many years after
Archimedes, we will not accept

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:44.015
this on faith.
We want to be able to show this

00:28:44.015 --> 00:28:47.587
is the case.
There are several ways to prove

00:28:47.587 --> 00:28:50.107
this.
One way, which I like,

00:28:50.107 --> 00:28:54.090
is to say if you,
if the thing you are hanging

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.870
here, was itself a chunk of
water shaped like that,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.859
you don't have to do anything.
Because that chunk of water can

00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:06.510
float at that height for free.
But now, if you took the chunk

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.613
of water and put a stone here of
the same shape,

00:29:09.613 --> 00:29:13.309
the rest of the fluid doesn't
know what you're doing.

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:16.539
It applies the same force that
it would to its own colleagues.

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:19.480
Namely, if this is water,
the rest of the water is in a

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.420
configuration ready to support
that amount of water.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.871
So, if you took that water out
and put something in,

00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:27.754
the water will apply the same
amount of force and the rest of

00:29:27.754 --> 00:29:30.549
it is your problem.
You apply the remaining force.

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:34.641
So, the water is ready to
support its own kind of any

00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:37.115
volume.
That's the meaning of being in

00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:39.307
equilibrium.
Any chunk of water is in

00:29:39.307 --> 00:29:41.085
equilibrium;
therefore, it's getting an

00:29:41.085 --> 00:29:42.400
upward force equal to the
weight.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.515
What we are saying is,
if without disturbing the

00:29:44.515 --> 00:29:47.170
environment, you take the water
out and put something in its

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.592
place,
the rest of the guys will apply

00:29:49.592 --> 00:29:52.405
the same force.
Now, one formal way to prove

00:29:52.405 --> 00:29:55.740
that--you can take various
geometries, but I prefer a

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.466
cylindrical geometry.
So this is, in this example,

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:03.059
not a piece of water,
but a new material you've

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:06.913
introduced inside the water.
And we want to find the

00:30:06.913 --> 00:30:09.829
buoyancy force.
What is the net force of

00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:13.481
buoyancy?
Well, it's the pressure at the

00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:18.519
bottom times the area,
minus pressure at the top times

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:21.916
the area.
We have already seen the

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:25.959
difference in the pressure is
ρgh A,

00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:29.250
but h is now this
height.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.889
Well, h times A
is the volume of the water,

00:30:31.889 --> 00:30:34.104
ρ times that is the
weight of the water,

00:30:34.104 --> 00:30:37.481
the mass of the water.
That times g is the

00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:40.984
weight of the liquid displaced.
You can prove this for a

00:30:40.984 --> 00:30:42.731
cylinder;
you can prove this for all

00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:45.140
oddball shapes,
by thinking a little harder.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.750
But this is good enough.
So, basically the body weighs

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.120
less in water because the lower
part of the body is being pushed

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.650
up harder than the upper part of
the body is being pushed down,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.410
because the pressure increases
with depth.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:01.460
That's why you get this result
from Archimedes.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.805
Now, you have to be a little
careful on writing the equation,

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:09.500
because if this was made of a
material like iron,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.145
then the density of iron is
less than--is more than the

00:31:14.145 --> 00:31:17.183
density of water.
So, the weight of that chunk of

00:31:17.183 --> 00:31:19.809
iron will be more than the
weight of the water displaced.

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:23.192
So, you will have to provide a
net force, and you can support

00:31:23.192 --> 00:31:27.421
it with the cable.
But suppose this was not made

00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:31.317
of iron, but made of cork?
If it's cork,

00:31:31.317 --> 00:31:33.910
it won't want to be there.
Right?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.027
Because then,
the applied force by the water

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:38.440
is more than the weight it takes
to support it.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.940
So, the cork will then bob up
to the surface.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.705
It will look like this.
If you want to keep it down,

00:31:49.705 --> 00:31:53.045
it's like a rubber ducky.
You want to keep the rubber

00:31:53.045 --> 00:31:56.859
ducky inside the water level,
you've got to pull it down,

00:31:56.859 --> 00:32:00.558
or you want to tie it to the--I
think one of the problems I gave

00:32:00.558 --> 00:32:04.140
you--has somebody tied this
piece of whatever to the floor.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.275
Then it'll stay.
But things will bob up to the

00:32:07.275 --> 00:32:08.910
surface.
And the question is,

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.644
"How far up will it go?"
We know part of it's going to

00:32:11.644 --> 00:32:14.019
be inside and part of it's going
to be outside.

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:17.150
And you can ask how much will
be outside and how much will be

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.634
inside?
You can already guess the

00:32:19.634 --> 00:32:25.483
answer, but let's prove it.
Let f be the fraction

00:32:25.483 --> 00:32:30.359
immersed, fractional volume
immersed.

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:37.204
Then, we can say the weight of
the liquid displaced is equal to

00:32:37.204 --> 00:32:41.619
the fractional volume times
ρ,

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:45.230
times g,
times the total volume,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.890
is the ρ of water.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.366
You understand?
This is the weight of water

00:32:54.366 --> 00:32:57.539
equal to the full volume;
this is the fraction of water

00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:59.849
displaced.
So, this is simply the weight

00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:03.629
of this shaded region here.
And that is going to be equal

00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:06.829
to the weight of the thing
that's floating;

00:33:06.829 --> 00:33:10.470
that is the ρg times
full volume.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.421
If you cancel the g,
and you cancel the volume,

00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:18.894
you find that the fraction that
is immersed is the density of

00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:22.250
the material divided by density
of water.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.248
In other words,
if this material is 90 percent

00:33:29.248 --> 00:33:32.406
the density of water,
it will be immersed by 90

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:34.952
percent.
That's exactly what happens

00:33:34.952 --> 00:33:36.787
with ice.
As you all know,

00:33:36.787 --> 00:33:39.630
ice has a smaller density than
water.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.536
One of the great mysteries.
Normally, when you cool

00:33:42.536 --> 00:33:45.654
something it condenses and
reduces in volume and the

00:33:45.654 --> 00:33:48.843
density will go up.
But ice actually expands when

00:33:48.843 --> 00:33:50.725
you cool it.
That's why the density of ice

00:33:50.725 --> 00:33:52.000
is less than the density of
water.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.141
That's why ice floats on water.
That's the reason icebergs look

00:33:58.141 --> 00:34:04.669
like this, because the big part
of the iceberg--;that's the very

00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:09.153
peculiar property of ice.
That's why you have those

00:34:09.153 --> 00:34:12.953
movies like the Titanic where
you've got a huge ice thing and

00:34:12.953 --> 00:34:14.715
it's floating.
First of all,

00:34:14.715 --> 00:34:17.668
if the density of ice was more
than the density of water,

00:34:17.668 --> 00:34:19.830
these two actors would still be
alive.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.485
Okay?
But what happens is it is

00:34:22.485 --> 00:34:26.235
floating, and not only that;
what you see is maybe a small

00:34:26.235 --> 00:34:29.836
fraction of the whole thing.
That's why those big ships went

00:34:29.836 --> 00:34:31.986
down.
Okay, but it's all thanks to

00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:35.541
this accident of nature that,
here is one substance which,

00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:38.660
when cold, increases
its--decreases in density.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.739
Alright.
Now, Archimedes' principle has

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:46.434
got hundreds of applications.
If you want to build a boat,

00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:51.000
here's how we build a boat.
Here is the steel boat.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Now, you cannot come to me and
say, "How do you make a steel

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.610
boat float in water?"
Okay.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.150
It's not a solid steel boat.
Okay?

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.961
If you are thinking about a
solid steel boat,

00:35:03.961 --> 00:35:05.650
you should get in another line
of work.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.291
This is a thing made out of
steel, but it's completely

00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:11.667
hollow.
So, what we claim is,

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:16.438
this amount of water weighs the
same amount as that amount

00:35:16.438 --> 00:35:21.010
of--see, the shaded region.
So, you can easily calculate

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.910
how deep this one should sink to
balance its weight.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.580
Right?
That, I assume you know how to

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.560
do that.
Take this to be a rectangular

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.954
boat.
The cross section is

00:35:29.954 --> 00:35:32.148
rectangular;
it's gone down to a depth

00:35:32.148 --> 00:35:34.320
ρ, and to a depth
h.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.154
Therefore, the volume of water
displaced, is h times the

00:35:38.154 --> 00:35:41.061
area of the boat,
cross sectional of the area of

00:35:41.061 --> 00:35:44.386
the floor of the boat.
That's the volume of water,

00:35:44.386 --> 00:35:47.820
that's the mass of water,
that's the weight of water.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.987
That's the weight of the boat.
If you tell me how many tons

00:35:51.987 --> 00:35:56.717
the boat weighs and you give me
the area of the base and

00:35:56.717 --> 00:35:58.956
g,
and density of water,

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.139
I'll tell you what height it'll
sink.

00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:03.610
Then, of course,
you can load more and more

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.021
cargo in this,
you know, if you have a top

00:36:06.021 --> 00:36:08.610
here, start putting more and
more cargo;

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.320
this will go down until the
boat looks like this.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.469
And that's as far as you can
push it.

00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:18.480
That's the kind of simple
calculation you will be asked.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.990
How much cargo can the boat
take?

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.003
Well, that's very simple.
The weight of the boat plus

00:36:23.003 --> 00:36:26.789
weight of the cargo is maximal
in this critical situation,

00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:29.179
when it's just about to go
under.

00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:31.888
Therefore, the total volume of
water displaced,

00:36:31.888 --> 00:36:33.832
times the density,
times g,

00:36:33.832 --> 00:36:36.599
will be the weight of your boat
plus cargo.

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:39.778
And these are all elementary
applications,

00:36:39.778 --> 00:36:42.570
and they came from two
principles.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.590
One is the pressure increases
with depth;

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.765
the second is that the weight
of the liquid displaced is the

00:36:48.765 --> 00:36:51.880
weight of the--is the reduction
in weight.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.063
So, you can imagine three
cases, one where the density of

00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:57.849
the material is more than the
density of water,

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:00.766
in which case it'll start going
down and you will have to hold

00:37:00.766 --> 00:37:03.649
it up with a cable,
but you won't have to apply the

00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:07.239
same force as you would outside.
The second example is when the

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:10.260
density of the object is less
than the density of water,

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.986
in which case it will float,
with a certain fraction of it

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:15.329
immersed, and a certain fraction
of it outside.

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:19.514
The fraction immersed is simply
the same fraction as what you

00:37:19.514 --> 00:37:23.280
get by dividing its density by
the density of water.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.780
Also, the density of water
changes.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.622
In the Dead Sea,
because of the salt

00:37:28.622 --> 00:37:30.780
concentration,
density is a lot higher.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.180
So, it's a lot easier for
people to float.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:39.296
Okay.
Now, for the last and final

00:37:39.296 --> 00:37:44.269
topic that's called Bernoulli's
Equation.

00:37:44.269 --> 00:37:48.467
This is the first time I'm
going to consider fluids in

00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:51.680
motion.
So far, my fluids were at rest.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.801
And it's really very simple.
But notice one more time,

00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:59.340
all I ever invoked was Newton's
Law of Motion.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.422
You realize that?
I just took this fluid and took

00:38:02.422 --> 00:38:05.968
that fluid, balanced the forces,
and said there should be no

00:38:05.968 --> 00:38:08.322
acceleration.
If I can convince you of the

00:38:08.322 --> 00:38:10.409
one thing, I have accomplished
something.

00:38:10.409 --> 00:38:13.999
To realize that all the
mechanics we have done does not

00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:16.989
appeal to any other law than
F = ma.

00:38:16.989 --> 00:38:19.749
In all these problems of
equilibrium, a is zero,

00:38:19.749 --> 00:38:22.249
F is zero.
Just from that fact,

00:38:22.249 --> 00:38:25.460
and clever applications of F
= ma.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.618
For example,
it's very clever to think of a

00:38:27.618 --> 00:38:30.599
piece of the water and demand
that it be in equilibrium.

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:33.360
That's how we find how the
pressure varies with depth.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.079
But there's no new principle so
far.

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:39.080
In fact, there's going to be no
new principles at all this term.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.904
And relativity was different.
The old space-time was

00:38:41.904 --> 00:38:45.634
modified, but non-relativistic
mechanics is all coming from

00:38:45.634 --> 00:38:47.949
Newton's law,
as is this problem.

00:38:47.949 --> 00:38:51.332
So, we're going to display for
the first time,

00:38:51.332 --> 00:38:53.920
fluid motion.
We're going to take the most

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.842
general case of fluid motion,
where there's water in some

00:38:56.842 --> 00:39:00.371
pipe.
This is the most famous picture

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:04.214
in all the textbooks.
We have not thought of a better

00:39:04.214 --> 00:39:06.025
picture now.
We're all working on it,

00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:08.510
but this is all we can come up
with after 300 years.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:12.251
Water flowing in a pipe.
This point is going to be

00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:15.164
called 1;
this point is going to be

00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:18.945
called 2.
Everything here will have a

00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:22.382
subscript 1.
That means, measured from some

00:39:22.382 --> 00:39:25.598
ground, that's at a height
h_1,

00:39:25.598 --> 00:39:28.539
that's at a height
h_2.

00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:32.397
The velocity of the fluid here
is some V_1,

00:39:32.397 --> 00:39:36.190
the velocity of the fluid there
is V_2.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.892
And ρ is the density of
the fluid, and that's not

00:39:39.892 --> 00:39:43.110
variable.
So, imagine now a steady flow

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:48.176
of some fluid through a pipe,
whose area of cross section is

00:39:48.176 --> 00:39:52.900
changing, and the overall
altitude is also changing.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.350
You can have a huge,
you know, pipe in the basement

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:58.242
where the whole supply to the
house comes, branches out into

00:39:58.242 --> 00:40:01.263
little pipes maybe;
this could be the pipe in the

00:40:01.263 --> 00:40:03.089
attic.
Small cross section possibly at

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:04.679
a bigger height,
it doesn't matter.

00:40:04.679 --> 00:40:08.860
But we're not considering pipes
that break up into four or five

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.809
pipes.
This is just a single pipe.

00:40:10.809 --> 00:40:15.559
So, here is the first law that
you have to satisfy.

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:20.400
If the fluid is incompressible,
there's a certain law.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.300
And we are going to talk about
that law.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.080
That's called the "equation of
continuity."

00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:31.614
It relates the area here and
the velocity here,

00:40:31.614 --> 00:40:34.639
to the area here and the
velocity here.

00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:36.889
And the relationship should not
surprise you.

00:40:36.889 --> 00:40:40.752
The basic premise is going to
be you're shoving in water from

00:40:40.752 --> 00:40:44.550
the left, and the water cannot
pile up between here and here

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.742
because it's incompressible.
That means in that volume,

00:40:47.742 --> 00:40:49.310
you can only pack in so much
water.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.933
So, what comes in has to go out.
It follows that it's got to go

00:40:52.933 --> 00:40:55.840
out much faster here because the
area is smaller.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.908
And what's the relation?
You can almost guess it,

00:40:58.908 --> 00:41:01.598
but let's prove that.
How much water do you think

00:41:01.598 --> 00:41:05.010
comes in through this phase,
if you wait one second?

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.769
Can you visualize in your mind
that in one second a certain

00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:11.900
amount of fluid comes in,
maybe until that point,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.719
and the cross section of that
fluid is A,

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:17.059
the distance it travels is
V.

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:20.529
So, the volume of the fluid
coming in from the left is

00:41:20.529 --> 00:41:23.409
really A_1V
_1.

00:41:23.409 --> 00:41:28.510
That's called the flow rate
coming in.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.824
And that's got to flow out,
and that's the flow rate

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:35.719
outside.
So, in an incompressible fluid,

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:39.553
if I tell you the flow rate at
one point, I've told you the

00:41:39.553 --> 00:41:42.592
flow rate everywhere.
Think of cars going down a

00:41:42.592 --> 00:41:44.881
freeway, and the freeway's
getting narrow,

00:41:44.881 --> 00:41:47.953
but unlike in real life,
we don't allow the cars to pile

00:41:47.953 --> 00:41:49.920
up.
We want the density of cars to

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.205
be the same.
That means if there's a narrow

00:41:52.205 --> 00:41:55.239
road, they've got to go faster
to maintain the traffic.

00:41:55.239 --> 00:41:57.835
That follows--Then,
it follows, that if I go to one

00:41:57.835 --> 00:42:00.949
checkpoint and see how many cars
cross me per second here,

00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:03.349
the same number will cross
anywhere else.

00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:06.685
But the speeds will be in
inverse proportion to the area

00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:09.050
so that the product remains the
same.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.500
Now, let me show this to you in
another way.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.013
It's going to be helpful.
Let me wait a small time

00:42:16.013 --> 00:42:18.957
Δt.
In a small time Δt,

00:42:18.957 --> 00:42:22.070
this front that was here would
advance there.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.709
It'll go a distance
V_1 times the

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:26.855
Δt.
On the other end,

00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:31.699
this front will advance the
distance, V_2

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:35.512
times Δt.
Now, the volume that got pushed

00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:38.374
in the time Δt is
A_1V

00:42:38.374 --> 00:42:41.850
_1Δt,
and that's the volume that came

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.798
out on the other side.
And you can cancel the

00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:47.420
Δts and come up with the
result I gave you.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.031
So wait a short time,
see what comes into the left

00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:53.550
phase, and see what goes out of
the right phase and equate them.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.559
Okay.
Now, we are going to find a

00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:05.244
constraint between the state of
the fluid here and the state of

00:43:05.244 --> 00:43:08.221
the fluid there.
What I'm going to do--Look,

00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:11.361
think about what's going to
happen before you derive any

00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:13.789
formula.
Suppose you're going uphill.

00:43:13.789 --> 00:43:17.297
Does it make sense to you that
when the fluid climbs uphill

00:43:17.297 --> 00:43:20.862
it's going to slow down?
It will slow down on the way to

00:43:20.862 --> 00:43:24.139
the top, because it's got to
work against gravity.

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:26.626
Even if you threw a rock up
there, it's going to go up and

00:43:26.626 --> 00:43:28.851
slow down.
Therefore, there's going to be

00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:32.312
some connection between the gain
in height and the velocity of

00:43:32.312 --> 00:43:34.718
the fluid.
Just from the Law of

00:43:34.718 --> 00:43:38.400
Conservation of Energy.
That's all I'm going to do.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.936
Here is what I'm going to do.
You remember if there are no

00:43:41.936 --> 00:43:45.508
external forces on a system,
kinetic plus potential is

00:43:45.508 --> 00:43:49.650
kinetic plus potential.
If there are external forces on

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.967
a system, kinetic plus potential
after minus kinetic plus

00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:57.514
potential, before,
is the work done by external

00:43:57.514 --> 00:43:58.440
forces.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.390
That's what I'm going to use
here.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.537
What are the external forces,
and what's the energy is what

00:44:10.537 --> 00:44:13.708
I'm going to think about.
So, here's what I'm going to

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:16.552
focus on.
Take this region of fluid

00:44:16.552 --> 00:44:21.710
trapped between these two cross
sections at t = 0.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:26.428
Wait a short time Δt.
What happens to the body of

00:44:26.428 --> 00:44:28.780
fluid?
It does what I told you.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.349
In the front,
it advances to the new region

00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:34.938
there.
Maybe I should draw better

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:38.760
pictures here.
This is the advance of the rear

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.797
guard, and in the front,
the fluid that used to

00:44:42.797 --> 00:44:46.220
terminate here has gone up to
there.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.845
In other words,
if I colored this fluid,

00:44:51.845 --> 00:44:53.960
just this part of the fluid
between here and here,

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.596
a different color from the rest
of the fluid,

00:44:56.596 --> 00:45:00.191
a short time later that colored
liquid will be occupying this

00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:02.361
new volume.
It's the same numerical volume,

00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:03.920
but it's a slightly different
volume.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.086
I'm going to compare the energy
of this chunk of fluid before

00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:12.089
and after.
You realize that in that

00:45:12.089 --> 00:45:16.521
comparison this region in
between the shaded regions is

00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:19.639
common to both the chunks of
fluid.

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:23.357
Pointwise, the fluid in the
same location is going at the

00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:25.509
same velocity.
So, I don't have to worry about

00:45:25.509 --> 00:45:27.022
that.
That's common to before and

00:45:27.022 --> 00:45:29.042
after.
The only difference between

00:45:29.042 --> 00:45:32.595
final minus initial is the
energy contained in that region

00:45:32.595 --> 00:45:35.400
minus the energy contained in
this region.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.354
The rest of it,
like here, it was part of the

00:45:38.354 --> 00:45:40.570
old fluid;
it's part of the new fluid,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.130
it's at the same height going
at the same speed.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.650
So, you don't have to worry
about it.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.291
So, what's the volume?
What's the energy of this

00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:51.111
region?
The energy is going to be

00:45:51.111 --> 00:45:56.770
ρ times
A_2 times

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:02.198
Δx_2.
Δx_2 is the

00:46:02.198 --> 00:46:05.530
distance it advances here.
That's the volume of the fluid;

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:09.626
that's the mass of the fluid.
Sorry, that times g is

00:46:09.626 --> 00:46:10.980
the mass of the fluid.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.720
And the kinetic energy will be
mass times V^(2) over 2.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.987
Potential energy will be--I'm
sorry, am I doing something

00:46:25.987 --> 00:46:29.030
right?
I think I made a mistake.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.390
Sorry about that.
There is no g here.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.379
Let me do it more slowly.
What's the mass of the shaded

00:46:34.379 --> 00:46:35.737
region?
It's got a base

00:46:35.737 --> 00:46:38.447
A_2;
it's got a height

00:46:38.447 --> 00:46:41.493
Δx_2.
That's a volume,

00:46:41.493 --> 00:46:45.611
times density is the mass,
mv^(2) over 2 is the

00:46:45.611 --> 00:46:49.257
kinetic energy.
Potential energy would be the

00:46:49.257 --> 00:46:52.822
same mass times gh,
but I should call it

00:46:52.822 --> 00:46:57.730
gh_2.
Yep?

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.143
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:00.143 --> 00:47:02.459
Shankar: Oh,
you're worried about the height

00:47:02.459 --> 00:47:05.295
varying over the tube.
Yeah, we are neglecting that

00:47:05.295 --> 00:47:06.920
aspect.
That's an important point.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.822
You can ask,
when you say

00:47:07.822 --> 00:47:10.042
h_2 are you
talking about the middle or the

00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:11.869
end and so on.
But we are going to be dealing

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.245
with problems where the height
differences are much bigger than

00:47:14.245 --> 00:47:16.950
the cross section of the pipe.
So, we don't worry about that.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:22.938
Okay.
Now, what is the same quantity

00:47:22.938 --> 00:47:25.570
here?
It's going to be minus

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.663
ρA_1ΔX
_1,

00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:33.302
times V_1^(2)
over 2 plus ρ times

00:47:33.302 --> 00:47:37.401
gh_1.
That's the final energy minus

00:47:37.401 --> 00:47:40.103
initial energy.
That's got to be equal to the

00:47:40.103 --> 00:47:44.185
work done.
Now, who is doing the work on

00:47:44.185 --> 00:47:48.630
this?
Can you guys understand?

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:52.699
Where is the work coming from?
Yep?

00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:54.820
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.030
Shankar: Ah.
No.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.009
Gravity you don't count as a
force when you have a potential

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.110
energy for gravity.
Gravity is included.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.964
The minute you write
ρgh or mgh,

00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:08.152
you don't count gravity again.
Student: [inaudible]

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:11.659
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:48:11.659 --> 00:48:16.254
But if I'm looking at the fluid
in question, who is acting on

00:48:16.254 --> 00:48:18.550
that fluid?
Not what it's doing to others.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.950
Who are the others doing
something to this fluid?

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.886
Yep.
Student: [inaudible]

00:48:23.886 --> 00:48:25.382
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Now,

00:48:25.382 --> 00:48:27.186
the walls of the pipe will
apply a normal force,

00:48:27.186 --> 00:48:30.019
and that will not do any work.
Yes?

00:48:30.019 --> 00:48:32.606
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:32.606 --> 00:48:35.034
Shankar: Yeah,
but that person is somewhere

00:48:35.034 --> 00:48:36.159
here.
But remember,

00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:39.260
in mechanics you don't have to
go to people in remote places.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.521
I've told you,
when you apply Newton's law,

00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:43.460
the only kinds of forces are
what?

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.599
Remember from day one?
Contact forces.

00:48:46.599 --> 00:48:48.822
Except for gravity,
which reaches out and grabs

00:48:48.822 --> 00:48:50.780
everything.
We've included gravity.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.160
Who is this body of fluid in
contact with?

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.672
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:48:57.672 --> 00:49:00.540
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This fluid?

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.766
In between?
No, but I'm talking about this

00:49:02.766 --> 00:49:04.628
fluid.
I'm talking about all of this

00:49:04.628 --> 00:49:06.362
fluid.
My taking the difference of

00:49:06.362 --> 00:49:09.340
that shaded region and that
shaded region was a convenience,

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.420
but I'm looking at the energy
change in all of this fluid.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.000
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.474
Shankar: Yeah,
but the point is the fluid to

00:49:17.474 --> 00:49:20.908
the left here is pushing it,
and it is pushing the fluid to

00:49:20.908 --> 00:49:24.120
the right.
Okay?

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.922
That's the only way.
It is true there's a pump

00:49:25.922 --> 00:49:27.722
somewhere pushing the fluid in
the beginning,

00:49:27.722 --> 00:49:29.849
but you don't have to go all
the way to the pump.

00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:32.410
In the end you only ask,
who is in contact with me?

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:35.446
Well, it's the guys to the left.
So, they will exert a force

00:49:35.446 --> 00:49:38.809
P_1,
times A_1,

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:43.021
times Δx_1
because that's the force,

00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:46.612
that's the distance,
that's the work done on the

00:49:46.612 --> 00:49:48.765
fluid.
And the work done by the fluid

00:49:48.765 --> 00:49:51.389
is P_2,
A_2,

00:49:51.389 --> 00:49:54.870
Δx_2,
because if it moves to the

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:59.202
right it is doing work on the
left because it has work done on

00:49:59.202 --> 00:50:01.570
it.
There you go.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.837
Now you can see that
A_1Δx

00:50:03.837 --> 00:50:06.105
_1 and
A_2Δx

00:50:06.105 --> 00:50:09.653
_2 are all equal
because that is just the volume

00:50:09.653 --> 00:50:12.269
of the fluid displaced in a
short time.

00:50:12.269 --> 00:50:13.789
That is just the continuity
equation.

00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:16.358
If you divide everything by
Δt, if you like,

00:50:16.358 --> 00:50:18.876
then you will find that
Δx_2 over

00:50:18.876 --> 00:50:20.840
Δt is
V_2.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.242
I'm just using the fact
A_1V

00:50:22.242 --> 00:50:23.503
_1 is
A_2V

00:50:23.503 --> 00:50:25.903
_2.
So, if you cancelled those

00:50:25.903 --> 00:50:27.440
factors, what do I get?

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.969
I'm going to just write it for
you.

00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:35.909
Now, you guys can go home and
check it.

00:50:35.909 --> 00:50:40.432
P_1 -
P_2 = ½

00:50:40.432 --> 00:50:45.860
ρV_2^(2) +
ρgh_2,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:51.980
minus ½ ρV_1^(2)
- ρgh_1.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.570
Now, this is a derivation that
you can go home and study at

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.320
leisure in any book you like.
They're all the same;

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.794
the story is the same.
I can only tell you,

00:51:00.794 --> 00:51:03.548
if you like to know,
what the trick behind the

00:51:03.548 --> 00:51:06.018
derivation was.
I don't mind going over that

00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:08.560
because maybe there are
different volumes in question

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.320
and you may have gotten
confused.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.579
But first, let me write down
the result.

00:51:12.579 --> 00:51:16.098
By writing everything with 1 on
the one side,

00:51:16.098 --> 00:51:20.895
and 2 on the other side I get
this result: P_1 +

00:51:20.895 --> 00:51:25.133
ρV_1^(2) over 2 +
ρgh_1 =

00:51:25.133 --> 00:51:28.331
P_2 +
ρgh_2 + ½

00:51:28.331 --> 00:51:33.508
ρV_2^(2).
This is nothing other than the

00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:37.789
Law of Conservation of Energy
applied to unit volume.

00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:42.250
If you take one meter cubed of
the fluid, its mass is ρ

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.688
times 1.
So, this is really a mass of

00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:47.880
one cubic meter of the fluid.
This is its kinetic energy;

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.205
that's its potential energy.
That's the kinetic and that's

00:51:50.205 --> 00:51:51.507
the potential.
You might say,

00:51:51.507 --> 00:51:54.033
"Why aren't we just equating
kinetic plus potential to

00:51:54.033 --> 00:51:56.748
kinetic plus potential?"
It's because this chunk of

00:51:56.748 --> 00:51:59.550
fluid that I focused on is not
an isolated system.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.809
It's getting pushed from people
behind it, and it's pushing

00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:05.501
people ahead of it.
So, you've got to take the

00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:09.280
difference between the work done
on it, and the work done by it.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.141
Then, you will find they don't
quite cancel because the

00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:15.076
pressures are not equal.
If the pressures are unequal,

00:52:15.076 --> 00:52:18.321
you get an extra contribution.
But this is simply the Law of

00:52:18.321 --> 00:52:21.852
Conservation of Energy.
I got it by writing the Law of

00:52:21.852 --> 00:52:25.173
Conservation of Energy.
But it takes a while for you

00:52:25.173 --> 00:52:28.699
guys to get used to applying the
Law of Conservation of Energy.

00:52:28.699 --> 00:52:31.382
Maybe you are always used to
saying kinetic plus potential is

00:52:31.382 --> 00:52:33.747
kinetic plus potential.
You got used to that,

00:52:33.747 --> 00:52:37.133
or you also remember kinetic
plus potential may be less at

00:52:37.133 --> 00:52:40.520
the end than the beginning,
because there is friction.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.623
This is yet another thing.
Where there's no friction,

00:52:43.623 --> 00:52:46.353
but there are external forces
acting on a body,

00:52:46.353 --> 00:52:48.846
there is gravity,
which is included the minute

00:52:48.846 --> 00:52:50.760
you write a potential energy
mgh.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.454
There's the walls, too.
I think some of you brought up

00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:55.665
a very good point.
The walls are exerting a force,

00:52:55.665 --> 00:52:57.559
but that's perpendicular to the
fluid.

00:52:57.559 --> 00:53:00.780
In a real fluid,
the walls will in fact exert a

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.769
force parallel to the fluid,
and it's called viscosity.

00:53:04.769 --> 00:53:08.129
So, in a real fluid there will
be a drag on the fluid because

00:53:08.129 --> 00:53:11.880
the fluid really doesn't like to
move right up against the walls.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.739
It doesn't mind moving in the
middle of the tube.

00:53:13.739 --> 00:53:16.096
So, as you go near the edges,
the speed of the fluid will

00:53:16.096 --> 00:53:18.316
relax to zero.
There's a region where there's

00:53:18.316 --> 00:53:21.025
a lot of dissipation.
So, we're ignoring what's

00:53:21.025 --> 00:53:23.920
called viscosity.
We're ignoring all other losses.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.099
Then, this is simply the Law of
Conservation of Energy.

00:53:27.099 --> 00:53:30.464
And as to what I did with those
two volumes, maybe I'll repeat

00:53:30.464 --> 00:53:35.659
this so you can all follow this.
I'm saying, take all that fluid

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:41.764
now, find the total energy in
it, and ask what happened to

00:53:41.764 --> 00:53:46.933
that fluid a little later.
Well, fortunately,

00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:52.550
here the pipe also had some
problems [laughter].

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.637
Okay.
Where is this fluid a short

00:53:56.637 --> 00:53:59.530
time later?
I want you to think about it.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.519
This end has moved here,
this end has moved there.

00:54:02.519 --> 00:54:06.639
So, the fluid at the end of the
day is sitting there.

00:54:06.639 --> 00:54:10.228
I want the energy of all of
these guys minus the energy of

00:54:10.228 --> 00:54:12.655
all of this.
Then, you can see in the

00:54:12.655 --> 00:54:15.683
comparison, it's only this part
that has gained,

00:54:15.683 --> 00:54:19.300
and this part that has lost.
This part is common.

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.115
When I say common,
not only is the mass

00:54:21.115 --> 00:54:24.077
common--the location--at every
location the height and velocity

00:54:24.077 --> 00:54:26.833
are the same.
So, in the subtraction this

00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:28.929
will cancel that.
That'll cancel that.

00:54:28.929 --> 00:54:31.065
This will have nothing to
cancel and this will have

00:54:31.065 --> 00:54:33.726
nothing to cancel.
So, just focus on the relative

00:54:33.726 --> 00:54:37.519
increments, and that difference
is what gives you the net change

00:54:37.519 --> 00:54:40.590
in energy, and you equate that
to the work done.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.338
Okay.
So now, we are going to learn

00:54:43.338 --> 00:54:46.976
how to use this Bernoulli.
The main thing to notice about

00:54:46.976 --> 00:54:48.872
Bernoulli is,
for a minute,

00:54:48.872 --> 00:54:52.079
if you focus on fluid at the
same height.

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:54.969
Just think about the same
height.

00:54:54.969 --> 00:54:57.984
He tells you whenever the fluid
picks up speed,

00:54:57.984 --> 00:55:02.476
it's going to lose pressure.
Because P + V^(2) or

00:55:02.476 --> 00:55:06.500
something, is P + V^(2)
afterwards.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.080
If you increase V,
you're going to decrease

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.047
P.
And that's the thrust of

00:55:12.047 --> 00:55:15.429
Bernoulli on a qualitative
level.

00:55:15.429 --> 00:55:18.100
I'll give you some quantitative
examples.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:24.883
So, one example is a baseball.
Here's as baseball coursing

00:55:24.883 --> 00:55:27.713
through air.
If you like,

00:55:27.713 --> 00:55:32.677
you can sit and ride with the
baseball, and say the air going

00:55:32.677 --> 00:55:36.650
backwards and the baseball is
going that way.

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:42.570
Now, suppose you spin the
baseball like this.

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.624
If you spin the baseball,
it carries some of its own air

00:55:47.624 --> 00:55:52.219
due to friction between the
leather and the air.

00:55:52.219 --> 00:55:56.369
So, that velocity is counter to
the velocity of the drift here

00:55:56.369 --> 00:55:59.090
on the top and additive on the
bottom.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.373
So, the actual air velocity on
the bottom will be more on the

00:56:02.373 --> 00:56:05.492
bottom and less on the top
because you're subtracting this

00:56:05.492 --> 00:56:08.829
vector from the top and adding
this vector on the bottom.

00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:11.934
So, if the velocity is
different, this is the higher

00:56:11.934 --> 00:56:14.490
velocity region,
this is the lower velocity

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.561
region.
So, pressure here will be less

00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:20.239
than the pressure there.
So, the ball will sink down.

00:56:20.239 --> 00:56:23.429
If you spun it the opposite
way, the ball will rise up.

00:56:23.429 --> 00:56:26.964
If you spun the ball side to
side, the ball will curve from

00:56:26.964 --> 00:56:31.059
left to right.
So, that's the spin on the ball.

00:56:31.059 --> 00:56:35.539
If I spin the ball and release
it, then it produces extra

00:56:35.539 --> 00:56:37.959
forces.
This rising and falling is on

00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:40.010
top of the falling due to
gravity.

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:43.623
Even in a planet without
gravity you will have this extra

00:56:43.623 --> 00:56:46.169
force.
It's coming simply because the

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:49.620
velocity of the top and bottom
have been modified.

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.190
Here's another example.
Here's an airplane wing.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.277
The plane is going like this.
You'll go right with the plane,

00:56:58.277 --> 00:57:00.840
in which case the air seems to
be doing this.

00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.846
Far from the plane,
everything looks the same as if

00:57:09.846 --> 00:57:13.118
the wing were not there.
But near the wing,

00:57:13.118 --> 00:57:15.110
this is the flow of air past
the wing.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:19.595
Notice that these guys above
the wing have to travel further

00:57:19.595 --> 00:57:24.310
than the particles below the
wing so they can catch up here,

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:28.418
where everything is the same.
So, the velocity on top of the

00:57:28.418 --> 00:57:31.800
airfoil is faster;
therefore, pressure is lower.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.384
Pressure is lower than on the
bottom, then the difference in

00:57:35.384 --> 00:57:39.030
pressure times the area of the
wing will push the wing up.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:43.159
That's the lift you get when
you start a plane.

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:46.320
When you're on the runway,
this is why the plane goes up.

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.809
Once you're airborne,
you can tilt your wing.

00:57:48.809 --> 00:57:53.613
When you tilt your wing to this
angle, then of course it's very

00:57:53.613 --> 00:57:57.099
clear that you can get a
component of lift.

00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:00.235
But I'm talking about when the
wing is not tilted but

00:58:00.235 --> 00:58:03.469
horizontal.
That's what gives you the lift.

00:58:03.469 --> 00:58:11.260
Now, what if you made a wing
that looks like this?

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.910
Okay.
So, you're all laughing.

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:16.539
But this has a use too.
Have you seen it anywhere?

00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:17.505
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:58:17.505 --> 00:58:18.780
Shankar: Yes?
NASCAR.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.588
On the racetrack you want the
opposite effect,

00:58:21.588 --> 00:58:25.207
because you want to push down
on the car, and therefore you

00:58:25.207 --> 00:58:28.114
manufacture wings.
You go to the factory where by

00:58:28.114 --> 00:58:30.570
mistake they built a wing that
looks like this,

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.971
and you can bring it to your
race car and attach it,

00:58:32.971 --> 00:58:34.760
then it will keep the race car
down.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.340
Of course, you also have the
other option of going to the

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.059
wing and tipping it over and
applying it to the airplane.

00:58:40.059 --> 00:58:43.130
But if it did not occur to you,
if you thought once the wing is

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:46.051
made like I'm stuck with this
wing, well, go take it to your

00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:48.860
race car, attach it.
That'll push it down.

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.389
Because you want to get
traction.

00:58:50.389 --> 00:58:53.909
So, you can get the upward lift
or the downward lift.

00:58:53.909 --> 00:58:58.003
Now, it turns out this lift
theory is actually somewhat

00:58:58.003 --> 00:59:00.174
naive.
And I believed it for a long

00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:02.146
time.
Now, I know the story is more

00:59:02.146 --> 00:59:03.924
complicated.
There is a lot of truth to

00:59:03.924 --> 00:59:05.369
this, but it's not the whole
story.

00:59:05.369 --> 00:59:08.066
If you go into aeronautic
engineering, you will find out

00:59:08.066 --> 00:59:09.929
that it's a little more
complicated.

00:59:09.929 --> 00:59:13.739
The reason, the way to
calculate it precisely--But this

00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:18.184
general notion that when the air
moves fast it loses pressure is

00:59:18.184 --> 00:59:22.260
true.
So, here's another example.

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:26.330
If you have an atomizer,
you know, you have a perfume

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:31.389
here and you've got a pump.
And then, you have a tube here.

00:59:31.389 --> 00:59:35.110
When you squeeze the pump,
the instant you squeeze the

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:38.972
pump, you're driving a lot of
air here at high velocity,

00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:41.570
whereas the air here,
is at rest.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.810
So, high velocity air has a
lower pressure than low velocity

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:46.807
air.
Therefore, it will suck the

00:59:46.807 --> 00:59:50.020
perfume and spray it right on
your face [laughter].

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:55.410
Yes.
Okay.

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.900
Very good.

01:00:00.519 --> 01:00:03.545
You know, I've taught you so
many things, planet and

01:00:03.545 --> 01:00:06.630
supernovae, and galaxies,
but now I got a rise out of

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:08.651
this class.
They said, now we are telling

01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:11.380
you something useful [laughter].
Alright.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.645
So, now I'm going to do two
problems where I really start

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:17.039
putting numbers in.
This is very qualitative.

01:00:17.039 --> 01:00:19.260
I'm going to do quantitative
problems.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.166
And there are only two kinds.
So, when we are done,

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:25.469
we are done.
Here is a tank of water.

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:30.524
And I poke a hole in this
somewhere here,

01:00:30.524 --> 01:00:35.199
at a depth, let's call it
h.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:39.092
The question is,
"How fast will the water come

01:00:39.092 --> 01:00:41.781
out of here?"
Turns out you can use this

01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:44.780
Bernoulli's, whether it is
called Bernoulli's equation.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.760
You can use Bernoulli to derive
this.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.810
We just have to pick the points
one and two cleverly.

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:54.130
So, this is going to be point 1;
this is going to be point 2.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.340
Point 2, in fact,
is just outside that hole.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:04.271
So, what does Bernoulli say?
P_1,

01:01:04.271 --> 01:01:10.361
which is atmospheric pressure,
plus ½ ρV_1^(2)

01:01:10.361 --> 01:01:14.623
+ ρgh_1 =
P_2 + ½

01:01:14.623 --> 01:01:19.800
ρV_2^(2) +
ρgh_2.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.628
Let's modify this as follows:
let's pick h_2

01:01:23.628 --> 01:01:26.435
to be zero, then
h_1 is just

01:01:26.435 --> 01:01:28.416
this.
I mean, you can pick the zero

01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:30.802
any way you like.
So, where the hole is I'm

01:01:30.802 --> 01:01:33.464
calling zero.
So, I don't have to worry about

01:01:33.464 --> 01:01:37.086
this one.
V_2 is what

01:01:37.086 --> 01:01:39.895
I'm after.
What about P_1

01:01:39.895 --> 01:01:42.387
and P_2?
P_1 is

01:01:42.387 --> 01:01:45.257
atmospheric pressure there,
and right outside the hole it's

01:01:45.257 --> 01:01:47.852
also the atmospheric pressure.
So, P_1 and

01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:49.914
P_2 you cancel
because they're both equal to

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:50.740
atmospheric pressure.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.105
How about the velocity here?
You know that if you punch a

01:01:57.105 --> 01:01:59.774
hole in the tank and you drain
it, it's going to start moving

01:01:59.774 --> 01:02:01.698
down.
But we're going to imagine

01:02:01.698 --> 01:02:04.050
that's a huge tank,
ten meters diameter,

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.298
and this is a tiny pinprick.
Then, this velocity is

01:02:07.298 --> 01:02:09.650
negligible.
You can put that back in if you

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.242
like.
I'm just going to ignore that

01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:13.135
for now.
That tells me

01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:19.690
ρgh_1 = ½
ρV_2^(2);

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:23.876
cancel the ρ,
and you find V^(2) =

01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:27.739
2gh.
V_2^(2) =

01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:31.877
2gh.
Now, you remember this formula

01:02:31.877 --> 01:02:35.968
from day one.
This is the velocity a droplet

01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:40.184
would have if it,
say, spilled over the top and

01:02:40.184 --> 01:02:44.383
fell straight down.
Because that is just the

01:02:44.383 --> 01:02:48.750
mgh being converted to ½
mv^(2).

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.622
Because by the Law of
Conversation of Energy,

01:02:51.622 --> 01:02:55.409
the minute the fluid starts
coming out of here and draining

01:02:55.409 --> 01:02:58.835
out of the top,
I have traded droplets of water

01:02:58.835 --> 01:03:02.219
at the top for droplets of water
at the bottom.

01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:05.179
Therefore, since they had
potential energy at the top,

01:03:05.179 --> 01:03:08.139
they most likely have kinetic
energy at the bottom.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:12.473
But be clear about one thing:
the drop coming here is not the

01:03:12.473 --> 01:03:16.065
same drop moving at the top.
If I push it over the top,

01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:19.300
that would be the same drop,
and that's very clear to all of

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.878
us.
The beauty of this is this

01:03:20.878 --> 01:03:23.519
water is pushing down and
something's coming out here.

01:03:23.519 --> 01:03:26.409
It's coming out with the right
speed so that drop by drop,

01:03:26.409 --> 01:03:28.639
the kinetic energy of what
comes out here,

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:31.389
is the potential energy of
what's draining at the top.

01:03:31.389 --> 01:03:34.909
So, you can punch the hole at
various places.

01:03:34.909 --> 01:03:37.619
You know, once you punch a hole
here it's going to land there.

01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:40.087
And you can imagine the fun you
can have with this kind of

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:42.508
problem.
Where do I punch the hole so

01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:46.769
that if my dog is standing here
it's going to feed the dog?

01:03:46.769 --> 01:03:49.824
Or don't feed the dog,
go up in front of the dog,

01:03:49.824 --> 01:03:52.066
go past the dog.
Get the biggest range,

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:54.210
smallest range,
a whole bunch of problems.

01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:58.139
They will combine this
Bernoulli who will tell you how

01:03:58.139 --> 01:04:01.772
fast it's coming out with
chapter one of how to do

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:05.850
trajectories once the fluid is
coming out this way.

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:07.530
Okay.
Last topic.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.590
It's again--it's not even a new
topic.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:14.535
The last application of
Bernoulli has to do with

01:04:14.535 --> 01:04:18.639
the--what you call the Venturi
meter.

01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:22.665
By the way, you can imagine
this is just a cross section of

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:25.579
possible applications of fluid
dynamics.

01:04:25.579 --> 01:04:27.679
You can take a whole course on
fluid dynamics.

01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:30.860
So, let's take the following
problem.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.820
So, you're going in an
airplane, and you want to find

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:41.409
out how fast the plane is going.
How do you think you find out?

01:04:41.409 --> 01:04:46.243
I will show you know one device
people use to find the flow

01:04:46.243 --> 01:04:51.409
rate, to find the speed of the
plane through the atmosphere.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:57.001
So, you go to the plane and you
attach the following device to

01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:59.660
the underside of the plane.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.510
Well, this, I'm imagining in my
mind a symmetric thing.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:09.090
This is a pipe with a
constriction.

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:14.900
Here the air is coming in at
the speed of the plane itself.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.356
See, in real life the plane is
going through the air,

01:05:18.356 --> 01:05:21.680
but go sit with the plane,
because the air is going

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.340
backwards at the speed of the
plane.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.630
So, that's a cross section
A_1 here.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:30.000
V_1 is what we
are trying to find.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.880
I hope you understand.
That's our goal.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.071
Then it comes to this region
where it has to speed up,

01:05:35.071 --> 01:05:37.721
because A_1V
_1 is

01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:40.070
A_2V
_2.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.858
If it speeds up,
the pressure of the air is

01:05:41.858 --> 01:05:43.916
going to be lower.
Let's first calculate the

01:05:43.916 --> 01:05:46.570
pressure difference between this
point and this point.

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:50.710
Now they're both at the same
altitude.

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.032
Here's another example.
You're 5,000 feet above the

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.969
ground;
don't worry about altitude to

01:05:54.969 --> 01:05:58.195
here or there or there.
That's, 5,000 is the big

01:05:58.195 --> 01:06:02.389
height, and that ρgh
cancels on both sides.

01:06:02.389 --> 01:06:05.971
We don't worry about the
variation in height over this

01:06:05.971 --> 01:06:07.143
gadget.
It's a very,

01:06:07.143 --> 01:06:09.869
very tiny thing you attach to
the underside of the plane.

01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:14.349
So then, I can say
P_1 + ½

01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:19.349
ρV_1^(2) +
ρgh_1,

01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:20.880
I'm not going to write because
h_1 and

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.070
h_2 are going
be equal.

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:28.980
Then, it's P_2
½ ρV_2^(2).

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:35.094
Therefore, P_2 -
P_1 = ½

01:06:35.094 --> 01:06:40.970
ρV_1^(2) -
V_2^(2).

01:06:45.489 --> 01:06:47.889
Now, V_1 is
the speed of the plane.

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:50.208
Now, V_2 is
not the speed of the plane,

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:52.189
but we know what
V_2 is because

01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:54.633
V_2 times
A_2 is equal to

01:06:54.633 --> 01:06:56.909
V_1 times
A_1.

01:06:56.909 --> 01:07:00.917
So, we can write here ½
ρV_1^(2) -

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:04.758
V_2^(2) =
V_1^(2) times

01:07:04.758 --> 01:07:09.349
A_1 over
A_2^(2).

01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:12.330
So, pull out the
V_1,

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:16.679
and you write it as ½
ρV_1^(2) times

01:07:16.679 --> 01:07:21.190
one minus (A_1/A
_2)^(2).

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.440
So, let's digest this formula
for a second.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.087
In this problem,
A_1 is bigger

01:07:31.087 --> 01:07:33.100
than A_2.
So, you may worry that 1 -

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.693
A_1/A
_2^(2) is

01:07:34.693 --> 01:07:36.454
negative,
but so is P_2 -

01:07:36.454 --> 01:07:38.904
P_1 because
P_2 here is

01:07:38.904 --> 01:07:41.769
certainly going to be lower than
P_1 here.

01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:43.721
So, if you're happier,
you can flip it backwards and

01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:45.940
write P_1 -
P_2 is something.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.653
You see that?
You can flip it over,

01:07:48.653 --> 01:07:51.966
provided you flip it over here.
But ask yourself,

01:07:51.966 --> 01:07:55.340
"What do I need to know to find
the speed of the plane?"

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:59.150
The speed of the plane is here.
The ρ is the density of

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:00.369
what?
Can you tell me,

01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:04.390
ρ is density of what?
Air;

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.476
ρ is the density of air.
A_1 and

01:08:06.476 --> 01:08:08.750
A_2 are known,
because you designed the tube.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.558
So, if you can find the
pressure difference,

01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:14.889
somehow, you can read off the
speed of the plane.

01:08:14.889 --> 01:08:23.684
So, what people do to find the
pressure difference is they go

01:08:23.684 --> 01:08:33.064
and they take--they punch a hole
there and they put here a fluid,

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:36.853
like oil.
If the plane is not moving,

01:08:36.853 --> 01:08:41.040
you can tell these two heights
must be equal because that's a

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.180
condition for the hydrostatic
equilibrium.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.550
Because these two pressures are
equal.

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.740
But if the plane starts moving
and the pressure here is lower

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.270
than the pressure here.
Imagine this is a high pressure;

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:55.086
that's low pressure.
It'll push the fluid up and

01:08:55.086 --> 01:08:58.937
it'll start looking like this,
with a little extra on the

01:08:58.937 --> 01:08:59.900
other side.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.420
And how much extra is it?
Well, let's think about it.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.250
The pressure at these two
points is the same;

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:13.600
the pressure here is what I
called P_1;

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.937
the pressure here is
P_2 + ρg times

01:09:17.937 --> 01:09:21.842
the height of this fluid.
This ρ is not the

01:09:21.842 --> 01:09:24.198
density of air.
This ρ is the density

01:09:24.198 --> 01:09:25.050
of, oil let's say.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:32.060
So, the minute the plane begins
to move, the pressure here will

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.149
be higher than pressure here;
the fluid will be pushed up.

01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:38.873
And the difference in these two
heights directly is a measure of

01:09:38.873 --> 01:09:40.992
the pressure difference.
That, in turn,

01:09:40.992 --> 01:09:42.240
is a measure of the velocity.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.325
So, what you will try to do is
then, forget all about the

01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:50.874
height difference,
and if you're clever enough you

01:09:50.874 --> 01:09:53.592
can put marking so that by
counting the difference in the

01:09:53.592 --> 01:09:56.310
markings you can translate to
the speed of the plane.

01:09:56.310 --> 01:10:00.449
You can also use this to find
the rate at which oil is

01:10:00.449 --> 01:10:02.471
flowing.
Suppose oil is flowing in a

01:10:02.471 --> 01:10:05.229
pipe and you want to know the
rate at which oil is flowing.

01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:11.690
Again, create a constriction in
the flow, then put some tubes.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.793
This cannot be oil;
this has got to be some other

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:16.408
fluid.
Once again, there'll be

01:10:16.408 --> 01:10:19.609
pressure difference and there'll
be height difference.

01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:22.303
And from the height difference
you can find the rate at which

01:10:22.303 --> 01:10:26.690
the fluid is flowing here.
So, what's the trick we use?

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.899
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:33.319
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

01:10:33.319 --> 01:10:36.239
for this one?
Student: [inaudible]

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:38.430
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Well,

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:41.170
I don't--I think all I'm--As
far as I can tell,

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.658
there's going to be a pressure
difference and that's going to

01:10:43.658 --> 01:10:45.109
translate into height
difference.

01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:48.529
And if the two do not mix,
I don't know the danger.

01:10:48.529 --> 01:10:51.323
I think one danger you may have
is if the fluid comes in here,

01:10:51.323 --> 01:10:53.750
and if it can penetrate this,
it will start mixing.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.366
Right?
So, for that purpose it may be

01:10:56.366 --> 01:10:59.579
better if this one is a higher
density than the one on top.

01:10:59.579 --> 01:11:04.326
Now in practice,
I am not really sure what kind

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:09.279
of fluids people use in any
engineering thing.

01:11:09.279 --> 01:11:12.439
My--I get very shaky when you
start going to the real world.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:15.433
It's been my practice to avoid
it as much as possible,

01:11:15.433 --> 01:11:17.409
which is why I chose this
career.

01:11:17.409 --> 01:11:20.537
But people who really want to
build something have to worry

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:23.108
about what fluid to use,
you know, what starts mixing,

01:11:23.108 --> 01:11:24.680
what doesn't mix,
what's the accuracy.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.155
So, I don't.
If I thought hard about it,

01:11:27.155 --> 01:11:30.075
I would try to reduce
everything to Newton's laws or

01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:32.955
some laws of thermodynamics.
But it would take years and

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.880
years to go from there to
something practical.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.989
So, I don't know in practice
what fluids people use.

01:11:37.989 --> 01:11:44.029
So, this is another example of
Bernoulli's principle.

01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:47.060
Final one, which is the kind of
a problem you sometimes do get.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.193
I'm not going to write the
equations or do the numbers,

01:11:50.193 --> 01:11:52.630
but I'll tell you how to think
about it.

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:54.979
Suppose you have a tank of
water.

01:11:54.979 --> 01:12:02.229
And I make another tube here
and I cap it.

01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:04.529
And the fluid here comes to
some height.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:07.745
First question you can ask is,
"What's the height to which

01:12:07.745 --> 01:12:10.565
fluid will rise here?"
Now, you know from your high

01:12:10.565 --> 01:12:13.601
school days it will rise to the
same height, but what's the

01:12:13.601 --> 01:12:16.690
argument that you will give
today for why that height has to

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:19.708
be the same?
You will use Bernoulli's

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:24.939
principle, and you will take two
points here, for example.

01:12:24.939 --> 01:12:26.829
Luckily, there's no velocity to
worry about.

01:12:26.829 --> 01:12:28.350
There is no height to worry
about.

01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:29.958
So, P_1 =
P_2,

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:32.010
which is what we did use by
other considerations.

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:34.846
Those pressures are equal.
If that is atmospheric

01:12:34.846 --> 01:12:36.630
pressure, that's atmospheric
pressure;

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:39.609
then, these columns have to be
equal.

01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:42.199
They're starting with
atmosphere plus ρgh;

01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:44.670
you want to hit the same number
here as there.

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:49.306
But now, if you open this pipe
and let the fluid really start

01:12:49.306 --> 01:12:52.319
flowing, then the story is
different.

01:12:52.319 --> 01:12:55.496
The minute fluid stops flowing
here--starts flowing--remember

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.825
from the Bernoulli,
if you've got a velocity,

01:12:57.825 --> 01:13:00.558
you lose pressure.
Pressure here will be lower

01:13:00.558 --> 01:13:03.229
than the atmosphere,
and then this will drop.

01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:06.631
It will drop so that
atmosphere, plus that height

01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:10.103
gives a pressure here,
that is atmosphere plus the

01:13:10.103 --> 01:13:13.079
bigger height gives the pressure
here.

01:13:13.079 --> 01:13:16.670
And the velocity here is
assumed to be negligible,

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:21.140
and the velocity here is some
velocity with which the fluid is

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.069
coming out.
Okay.

01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:27.169
So guys, have a good holiday in
spite of what I've done to you

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:30.327
most reluctantly,
and I'll see you all after the

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:31.327
break.

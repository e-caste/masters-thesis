00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.677
Prof: Okay,
I'm going to start with an

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:05.390
example.
 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.660
Isn't that a great shot of the
baby?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.790
I mean, the Web is so great.
 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.243
You can download pictures from
the Web that just look

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:10.810
fantastic.
 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.670
So I want to start by posing
you a problem.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.200
Jill and John are going to have
a baby, and Jill's got blue eyes

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.770
and John's got brown eyes.
 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.780
Okay?
 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.870
All of the other men whom Jill
knows have blue eyes.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.520
The baby has blue eyes.
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.970
&gt;
 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.490
Should John be worried?
 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.250
John's got brown eyes,
the baby's got blue eyes,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.250
should John be worried?
 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.281
Well, we can assume that brown
eyes are dominant to blue,

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.230
which roughly speaking is
correct.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.080
The actual situation is a bit
more complex.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.728
In fact, if you want to write a
paper on the evolution of eye

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.510
color and the genetics of eye
color, there's a lot out there.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.380
But this is approximately
correct.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.494
And John comes from an island
where one percent of the people

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:03.658
have blue eyes.
 

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:05.891
So that, just on the face of
it, would indicate that maybe

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.950
John ought to be worried.
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.659
But in fact just exactly how
worried should he be;

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.647
just based on genetics,
not based on behavior or rumors

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.420
or anything like that?
 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.470
Well we'll come back to that.
 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.147
I do that at the beginning just
to point out that there are

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:27.510
interesting issues here,
and that they are things that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.159
touch our daily lives.
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.507
So now I'm going to run
through, as much as I can,

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:36.879
genetics, in the next forty
minutes.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:40.792
And please speed me up or slow
me down, as you wish,

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:43.400
and don't hesitate to
interrupt.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.060
Some of this may already be
very familiar to you.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.780
So the genetic material is
deoxyribose nucleic acid.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.974
We have known that since 1945,
and we've known its structure

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:56.900
since 1953.
 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.425
And this is actually an
extremely important point:

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.518
Genes are solid particles that
are transmitted from parent to

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:03.239
offspring.
 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.819
They are not fluid.
 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.759
They're actually material stuff.
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.189
Okay?
 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.430
And we know exactly what it is.
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.092
They encode information,
as sequences of nucleotides,

00:02:15.092 --> 00:02:19.389
and in the DNA it's adenine,
thymine, guanine and cytosine.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.930
So you can think of those as
four letters.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.497
They string into a linear chain
to form a molecule,

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:28.637
and these, uh,
there are two strands that are

00:02:28.637 --> 00:02:32.419
twisted around each other to
form a double helix.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.788
So it looks like that.
 

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:40.577
The sugar phosphate strands
form the backbone,

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:45.627
and then the nucleotides are
glued onto the backbone and they

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:49.693
form pairs;
so adenine pairs with thymine,

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:52.780
and guanine pairs with
cytosine.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.397
The sugar phosphate backbone is
the same in every DNA molecule

00:02:56.397 --> 00:02:58.770
on the planet,
and the information in the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.560
molecule is in the sequence of
nucleotides.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.000
You can think of that as
letters forming words.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.818
So these are big molecules.
 

00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:11.540
If you were to put all the
chromosomes in your nuclei

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.271
together,
and just for one cell,

00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:21.530
and string them together,
one haploid copy is exactly one

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.449
meter long.
 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.824
So when they say it is a
macromolecule,

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.509
it is a serious macromolecule.
 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:32.740
It is a big thing.
 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.073
So just chop this piece of
measuring tape up into 26 pieces

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:39.349
and you get about the size that
you've got in each of your

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.270
chromosomes.
 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.729
Okay?
 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.530
When I first isolated DNA from
sugarcane,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.128
and condensed it in ethanol,
it came out,

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:49.900
in the ethanol mixture,
as a bunch of white,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.137
stringy strands,
and I could wrap it around a

00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:54.020
glass rod.
 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.430
This is big stuff.
 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.331
So we're not talking about
tiny, weensy,

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:00.258
little molecules.
 

00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:04.460
DNA is a biggie,
and it's very stable.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.180
Now, how does this relate to
organisms?

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.258
Well that's the issue of
genotypes and phenotypes,

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:14.400
and that's a question of
information and matter.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.776
So there's a general principle
here that's quite intriguing and

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:22.800
it has to do with how you turn
information into matter.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.302
The genotype is basically the
info in the DNA,

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:33.307
and every cell in your body has
got all the information in it

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:37.810
that is needed to build a whole
organism.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.199
That, by the way,
is an interesting statement,

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.536
because if we can overcome some
of the genetic programming of

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.908
the oocyte,
of the egg, we could,

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:48.749
in principle,
simply put a cotton swab into

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.810
your cheek and take one cell off
of your cheek and then do fancy

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.389
reproductive medicine and clone
you,

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.940
off of just the DNA in a cheek
cell.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.798
Now it turns out that the
developmental machinery in the

00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:04.449
egg is really critical,
and it's hard to do that.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.204
But just from the point of view
of the information,

00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:10.399
any cell in your body could be
used to make another you.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:14.213
I can pull out a hair cell,
take a cell off of the root of

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.220
the hair, do the same thing.
 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.009
The phenotype--basically you
should think of that as you.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:20.329
Okay?
 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:22.540
That's the material organism.
 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.310
It's built according to
genotypic instructions.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.810
So the genotype contains
information,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.276
the phenotype contains matter,
and the transformation from

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:36.899
information into matter is done
by developmental biology.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.122
Decoding that transformation is
one of the major research

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:43.000
agendas for the twenty-first
century in biology.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.600
It's called the construction of
the genotype/phenotype map.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.259
That's kind of modern jargon
for developmental biology.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.690
So where does the DNA actually
sit in the cell?

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.680
Well here's some more
vocabulary.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.439
I'm building vocabulary for
those of you who haven't been in

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.329
biology recently.
 

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.730
I'm going to say a few words
here.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.177
The eukaryotes,
the things that have a real

00:06:07.177 --> 00:06:09.572
nucleus--
which includes us and all other

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:12.485
multi-cellular organisms,
plus a whole bunch of

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.750
single-celled ones--
they have cells that have a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.165
nucleus and the DNA in the
nucleus is contained in

00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:21.875
chromosomes,
and these chromosomes are a

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.009
long structure that has kind of
a central scaffold,

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.250
it's got a central mirror.
 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.740
That's labeled 2 here,
on the slide.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.076
And the DNA itself is actually
wrapped around proteins in the

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:37.449
chromosome.
 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.160
In the prokaryotes,
which are the things that lived

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.086
on this planet for about the
first two billion years of

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:45.464
life--
that is, bacteria and

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:49.310
archaea--they are single-celled
organisms,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.319
and their DNA is basically not
in separate chromosomes,

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.370
but all in one circular loop.
 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.269
So it's a circular chromosome;
it's attached to the cell wall.

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:02.391
So there's a big difference in
the way that eukaryotes and

00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.492
prokaryotes are organized,
and in fact the eukaryotic

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:11.615
nucleus is very probably the
evolutionary residue of a

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:14.860
prokaryote;
that's where that organelle

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.259
probably came from.
 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.807
Anybody know what the other
organelles are,

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:25.139
that used to be independent
organisms?

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.370
Student:  Mitochondrion.
 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.759
Prof: A mitochondrion is
one.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.100
Student:  Chloroplast.
 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.370
Prof: Chloroplast is
another.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.649
Student:  Lysosomes.
 

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:35.779
Prof: Not isotopes.
 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.060
Well, maybe lysosomes.
 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.930
There's a little bit better
evidence though for another one.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.663
Spindle apparatus;
the spindle apparatus that

00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:49.988
pulls the chromosomes apart has
a little circular genome

00:07:49.988 --> 00:07:51.720
associated with it.
 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.860
Okay, a bit more on chromosomes.
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.377
The number of chromosomes is
usually constant,

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:00.425
within a species,
although there is some

00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:01.519
variation.
 

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:04.528
You get 23 from your mom and 23
from your dad.

00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:09.483
So you've got 46 sitting in
every cell of your body,

00:08:09.483 --> 00:08:15.019
except your red blood cells
which don't have a nucleus.

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.971
That dual set,
one from mom and one from dad,

00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:20.990
together it's called the
diploid condition.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.990
Okay?
 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.220
So d-i--2;
from Greek, diploid.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.144
And in contrast to that,
your eggs and your sperm are

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:30.899
haploid.
 

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:32.710
So the gametes are haploid.
 

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.428
They have one set.
 

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:37.019
Haploid means one set of
chromosomes.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:39.669
So the haploid number in humans
is 23.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.769
The diploid number is 46.
 

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:52.460
World record for a eukaryotic
minimum chromosome number is 1.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.832
Ascaris, a nematode that lives
in the gut of dogs,

00:08:56.832 --> 00:08:58.529
has 1 chromosome.
 

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:02.889
World record for maximum number
of chromosomes?

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:05.368
Actually it's probably also in
ascaris, but in the somatic

00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:05.889
condition.
 

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:10.855
That one chromosome falls into
about 1000 pieces when it

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:11.850
develops.
 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.490
So chromosome number varies
widely.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.058
They've got genes and other
things in them.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.841
You can think of a chromosome
as being about 1000 genes,

00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.486
and you can think of a gene as
having several thousand

00:09:25.486 --> 00:09:27.000
nucleotides in it.
 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.558
And you can think of a gene as
being a segment of DNA that

00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:33.370
tells a cell to make a
particular protein,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.082
a particular structural RNA,
and through splicing and other

00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:40.732
things there are various other
classes of RNA that are now

00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:44.678
important;
regulatory RNAs.

00:09:44.678 --> 00:09:49.836
You're made out of proteins and
materials whose construction is

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:53.830
basically governed by the
actions of proteins.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.649
And so the DNA in your genome
is a set of instructions on how

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:03.470
to make what kinds of proteins
at certain places and times to

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.048
control the construction of the
organism and determine the

00:10:08.048 --> 00:10:10.620
uniqueness of the species.
 

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.395
This, uh, you know,
in a few words,

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:20.394
describes something which is
incredibly complicated and

00:10:20.394 --> 00:10:21.950
beautiful.
 

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.837
And if you think about how
complicated your eyes or your

00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:29.019
brains or your livers or
whatever else is,

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:32.291
and you think about that for
all of the ten to a hundred

00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:34.730
million species of organisms on
earth,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.865
the amount of information
stored in the genomes of the

00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:44.808
organisms on earth is just
absolutely astounding.

00:10:44.808 --> 00:10:47.375
And by the way,
when one goes extinct,

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:50.913
it's kind of like burning the
library at Alexandria,

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:53.690
and we lose all of that
information.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.445
Okay, genes are in specific
locations and they come in

00:10:58.445 --> 00:11:00.058
different forms.
 

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.509
So again, this is vocabulary
building.

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.384
We call the place that a gene
is found on a chromosome its

00:11:06.384 --> 00:11:09.740
locus;
this is in classical genetics.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.658
And genes can be found in
different versions.

00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:17.850
We call those different
versions alleles.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.187
So, for example,
the gene for eye color is

00:11:21.187 --> 00:11:23.058
either blue or brown.
 

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:28.200
Those would be the allele for
blue or the allele for brown.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.538
If you are carrying two
different versions of the gene--

00:11:34.538 --> 00:11:36.551
you got one from your mom and
you got one from your dad and

00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:38.827
they're different--
then you're a heterozygote,

00:11:38.827 --> 00:11:41.980
and we call that condition the
heterozygous condition.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.503
If you got the same one from
both parents,

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:50.316
then you're a homozygote,
and we call that the homozygous

00:11:50.316 --> 00:11:51.519
condition.
 

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.658
What does a gene look like?
 

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:56.350
Well there's a lot now that's
known about this,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.490
and as a matter of fact I
encourage you to do things like

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.408
go on the Web and just type
gene structure,

00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:07.600
and have a look at all the
diagrams that pop up.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.028
Normally a gene has got a
codon--that is,

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:13.961
three nucleic acids--that say,
"This is where you're

00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:15.950
going to start reading me
off."

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.086
And then it's got another one
down at the end that's a stop

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:20.038
codon, that says "That's
where you stop."

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:24.009
And then in between that you've
got a long string of DNA--

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:26.678
this is in eukaryotes,
not in prokaryotes--

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:29.692
a long string of DNA,
and some of it is going to end

00:12:29.692 --> 00:12:32.408
up coding for protein and some
of it is not.

00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:35.490
So the part that will code for
protein we call the exons;

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.506
the part that is going to be
cut out and spliced and put into

00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:40.720
messenger RNA,
to go out and make protein.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.750
And the part that is not we
call introns.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:51.970
So not all the DNA is going to
go out and become protein.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.532
The central dogma of molecular
biology, basically,

00:12:56.532 --> 00:13:00.070
is that DNA makes RNA makes
protein.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.440
And transcription is copying
the DNA into messenger RNA,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.389
and that's done with
complementary pairing,

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:11.466
and in the process,
the thymine is replaced by

00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.519
uracil in the messenger RNA.
 

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:16.048
The introns are cut out and
discarded.

00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:20.077
The exons are spliced together
and the RNA is then translated

00:13:20.077 --> 00:13:22.159
into protein in the ribosome.
 

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.538
There's a lot of activity here
for RNA.

00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:34.722
RNA is doing a lot of stuff,
and in fact it's because of the

00:13:34.722 --> 00:13:38.590
amount of engagement of RNA in
this very,

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.970
very basic process of life that
we think that RNA was probably

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.695
the original genetic molecule,
and that DNA evolved after RNA,

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:51.570
and then all of this process
developed after that.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.919
The reason for that is that RNA
has a very high mutation rate;

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:56.538
DNA has a low mutation rate.
 

00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:59.389
But RNA can be an enzyme and
DNA is not.

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:04.625
So RNA was a--both an
information storage molecule and

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:09.662
an enzyme, at the beginning,
close to the beginning,

00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:13.908
of life, and then DNA came
along later.

00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:19.125
So this is a picture of the
structure of genes and the

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:25.028
process that goes on when the
DNA is transcribed into RNA.

00:14:25.028 --> 00:14:29.780
The RNA is spliced and
assembled into a molecule that

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.620
is then going to code for a
polypeptide;

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.798
or a big polypeptide is a
protein.

00:14:35.798 --> 00:14:41.408
And that will then go through a
ribosome to make protein.

00:14:41.408 --> 00:14:45.529
So the messenger RNA--and by
the way,

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:52.370
heh, when I was sitting in this
room in 1965,

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.894
I was taught about messenger
RNA and the faculty would laugh

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:59.355
and they would say,
"Nobody's ever seen

00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:00.340
one."
 

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.990
That was forty years ago.
 

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.437
Now they are the basis of
high-tech genechips,

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:08.580
and people work with them all
the time.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.538
But that's--you know--this kind
of ghost in the machine,

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:18.046
from forty years ago,
became very concrete by about

00:15:18.046 --> 00:15:20.389
twenty-five years ago.
 

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:23.830
Transfer RNA is a much smaller
molecule.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.734
Transfer RNA,
if you think of messenger RNA

00:15:26.734 --> 00:15:30.330
as being that big,
transfer RNA is about that big.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.902
And it is the molecule that
matches the genetic code,

00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:36.720
that's sitting there in the
messenger RNA,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.850
to a particular amino acid.
 

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.856
So you can think of--say if
this is the messenger RNA

00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:45.702
sitting here,
the transfer RNA is coming

00:15:45.702 --> 00:15:49.360
along and sitting down on the
messenger RNA and matching the

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.549
code on it,
and then on its other end it's

00:15:52.549 --> 00:15:53.999
carrying--
like right here,

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:57.389
where I'm wiggling my finger--
it's carrying an amino acid.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:00.923
And this whole process will get
fed through a ribosome,

00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:04.589
and out at this end of it the
amino acids will get joined

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:05.440
together.
 

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.450
So the RNA will go out one part
of the ribosome,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.101
and out of another part will
come the growing chain of the

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:12.870
protein.
 

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.373
So the transfer RNA is actually
the translation device--it is

00:16:16.373 --> 00:16:19.467
what implements the genetic
code--which comes in units

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:20.519
called codons.
 

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:28.309
So it takes three nucleotides
to specify one amino acid.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.919
And you can think of it like
this.

00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:38.899
The DNA is a codon sequence.
 

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:43.015
It gets translated into an RNA,
and then in units of

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:46.730
three--okay, so in chunks of
three nucleotides,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.039
the RNA gets translated into
protein.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.841
Just to repeat this message,
RNA is playing a big role in

00:16:57.841 --> 00:17:01.640
this whole process,
and there's good reason to

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.338
suspect that it was the original
genetic macromolecule.

00:17:06.338 --> 00:17:08.845
There's an interesting
implication in this,

00:17:08.845 --> 00:17:12.424
and I will not shy away from
telling stories like this during

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:13.318
the course.
 

00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:18.660
Information is flowing out from
the genotype into the phenotype.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.400
It doesn't go in the other
direction.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.017
That's very important,
that it doesn't go in the other

00:17:24.017 --> 00:17:24.609
direction.
 

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.250
Okay?
 

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.961
This is a re-statement of
something that August Weismann

00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:31.588
said in the nineteenth century.
 

00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:34.626
He said that there is a
distinction between the

00:17:34.626 --> 00:17:38.125
genotype--the germline,
which is the genotype--and the

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.900
soma, which we now call the
phenotype.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.397
And Weismann basically said in
the 1880s that information flows

00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:51.276
from the genes out into the
organism and not back in the

00:17:51.276 --> 00:17:53.048
other direction.
 

00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:56.910
Now the implication of that is
that evolution of acquired

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.910
characteristics won't work.
 

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.422
In other words,
if during my lifespan I acquire

00:18:03.422 --> 00:18:06.622
a healthy tan,
my child will not inherit it

00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:09.686
because the information on
tanning isn't going to go back

00:18:09.686 --> 00:18:12.368
into my genome and get
transmitted to my kids.

00:18:12.368 --> 00:18:15.854
If I develop calluses on my
feet, they will not be

00:18:15.854 --> 00:18:16.848
transmitted.
 

00:18:16.848 --> 00:18:22.356
If a giraffe stretches its neck
on the savanna to try to get to

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:25.905
the top of the tree,
and thereby actually does

00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:29.400
physically lengthen its neck by
a couple of centimeters,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.380
that will not get transmitted
to the next generation.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.759
Okay?
 

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:37.960
So that would be evolution of
acquired characteristics-

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.693
-characteristics acquired during
the lifetime of the parent--and

00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:45.250
it doesn't work;
that's not how evolution works.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.320
You're probably sitting there
wondering, well how does it

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:47.578
work?
 

00:18:47.578 --> 00:18:49.338
Hey, that's what this course is
about;

00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:52.318
you're going to find out,
don't worry.

00:18:52.318 --> 00:18:56.750
Now there was a guy named
Trofim Lysenko,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.180
who was a demagogue and a
corrupt guy;

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.078
a pretty evil man.
 

00:19:03.078 --> 00:19:07.222
He claimed that evolution by
acquired characteristics would

00:19:07.222 --> 00:19:10.009
work, and it would work very
rapidly.

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:12.901
This would allow crop selection
to go on in a period of one

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.365
generation,
rather than ten or a hundred

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:18.538
generations,
and that therefore in Russia

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:23.117
Stalin would be able to move
people into Siberia and into

00:19:23.117 --> 00:19:26.880
areas where crops were not
currently grown;

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.842
and Lysenko said,
"And we can guarantee you,

00:19:29.842 --> 00:19:32.064
scientifically,
that these crops will

00:19:32.064 --> 00:19:32.990
work."
 

00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:40.977
The science was wrong and
millions of people died,

00:19:40.977 --> 00:19:43.509
because they starved to death.
 

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:48.960
Communist China was influenced
by Stalin,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.798
and in fact Mao bought this
stuff for awhile and carried out

00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:58.308
some similar policies during the
Great Leap Forward,

00:19:58.308 --> 00:20:02.652
in the 1950s,
and millions of people starved

00:20:02.652 --> 00:20:05.480
to death in China as well.
 

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.044
The Chinese found it a little
bit easier to get rid of this

00:20:09.044 --> 00:20:12.362
incorrect, this bad science,
because after all it was a

00:20:12.362 --> 00:20:13.529
Russian import.
 

00:20:13.529 --> 00:20:14.328
Right?
 

00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:17.205
So you could throw it out a bit
more easily than the Russians

00:20:17.205 --> 00:20:17.588
could.
 

00:20:17.588 --> 00:20:21.448
Lysenko, in fact,
persisted for quite a while in

00:20:21.448 --> 00:20:25.058
Russia,
and when he was denounced by

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:29.012
geneticists who told--
were trying to tell Stalin that

00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:33.156
it was bad science,
Lysenko arranged to have them

00:20:33.156 --> 00:20:35.069
killed;
and they were killed,

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:36.098
they were executed.
 

00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:40.880
Vavilov died in the gulag in
1943;

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.050
one of the greatest
evolutionary geneticists of the

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.318
twentieth century.
 

00:20:45.318 --> 00:20:49.798
So the point of this is that
there's some important stuff

00:20:49.798 --> 00:20:53.400
about genetics,
and it's not just abstract.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.381
It's affected science policy,
it's affected international

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:01.042
relationships,
and it's affected the ability

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:05.778
of agricultural practices to
support human populations.

00:21:05.778 --> 00:21:08.544
Ideas have very important
consequences,

00:21:08.544 --> 00:21:12.691
and this is just one of the
first that you're going to run

00:21:12.691 --> 00:21:14.509
into, in this course.
 

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:16.279
Okay, back to genetics.
 

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:19.230
Whoosh.
 

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.788
When the cells divide,
the DNA replicates and each

00:21:23.788 --> 00:21:27.230
daughter cell gets a complete
copy.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.750
This is how inheritance works.
 

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.326
Okay?
 

00:21:30.326 --> 00:21:34.940
This is why you look like your
parents.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:40.176
During replication the ends of
the DNA strand are loosened and

00:21:40.176 --> 00:21:45.071
opened up so that in the notch
between the two strands the

00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:47.818
nucleotides can be inserted.
 

00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:52.624
And all of this is done with
complex enzymatic machinery and

00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:55.230
it's done extremely precisely.
 

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.119
Only one mistake in about a
billion nucleotides occurs in

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:58.430
DNA.
 

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.646
It's almost impossible for
humans to construct a system

00:22:04.646 --> 00:22:06.868
that has that degree of
reliability.

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.557
Obviously this precision has
been an extremely important

00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:09.950
thing.
 

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.818
Natural selection has worked
very hard to get those enzymes

00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:14.818
that precise.
 

00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:20.490
When a mistake does occur,
that is one source of mutation.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.990
And, in fact,
the more frequently DNA is

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.490
copied, the higher the mutation
rate.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.598
So that's one place where
mutations come from.

00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:33.501
When this is going on,
this copying is going on in the

00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:37.472
process of the development of,
uh, a multi-cellular eukaryote,

00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:42.707
like yourselves,
or when it's going on in an

00:22:42.707 --> 00:22:45.358
asexual,
uh, eukaryote,

00:22:45.358 --> 00:22:49.994
basically what happens is the
chromosomes go through the

00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:51.848
process of mitosis.
 

00:22:51.848 --> 00:22:57.151
And in mitosis what--what's
going on is that the chromosomes

00:22:57.151 --> 00:23:01.463
will be duplicated,
they will line up at a plate,

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:05.980
at the center of the cell;
spindles will form.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.228
So these are proteins,
these react in the fibrils

00:23:09.228 --> 00:23:11.923
here,
and they are anchored to an

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:15.476
organizing center,
which is at the poles of the

00:23:15.476 --> 00:23:19.808
cell, and they attach to the
centromeres of the chromosomes,

00:23:19.808 --> 00:23:22.230
and they pull one copy into
each cell,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.848
and then the cell splits.
 

00:23:23.848 --> 00:23:27.886
So that's physically how the
copying occurs at the DNA level

00:23:27.886 --> 00:23:31.240
and then at the chromosomal
level, in the cell.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.380
And the picture basically is a
stained mitosis caught in an

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.740
onion root tip cell;
which is sort of the classical

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.588
place to observe this.
 

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:47.930
The important result of this is
that if you've got two genes,

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.890
A and a, that are alleles at
the same locus,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.623
the two versions of the gene at
the same place on the

00:23:54.623 --> 00:23:57.101
chromosome,
mitosis basically consists of a

00:23:57.101 --> 00:23:58.700
doubling--
of first a doubling of the

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.651
chromosome,
so you have enough copies to

00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:01.328
end up with.
 

00:24:01.328 --> 00:24:02.930
They line up at the middle of
the cell,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.807
and then the spindle apparatus
pulls one copy of the A and one

00:24:06.807 --> 00:24:09.338
copy of the a--
in this slide they're on

00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:14.299
different chromosomes--
into each of the daughter cells.

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:16.259
What about meiosis?
 

00:24:16.259 --> 00:24:20.150
Meiosis is the process that
produces gametes.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.400
So it takes the diploid parent
down into a haploid gamete.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.788
So it's a reduction division.
 

00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:32.746
The process is more
complicated, and in fact it is

00:24:32.746 --> 00:24:37.599
like sticking two mitoses
together in a sequence,

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:41.950
but with a bit of additional
machinery.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.332
So the first thing that happens
is that the chromosomes are

00:24:46.332 --> 00:24:50.640
duplicated and they are then
actually duplicated again.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.227
Then out of,
uh, out of the original

00:24:54.227 --> 00:24:59.660
chromosome there are two--out of
the original cell.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.338
You're going to go through a
process first of duplication,

00:25:03.338 --> 00:25:06.742
another duplication,
and you're going to reduce them

00:25:06.742 --> 00:25:09.811
each twice by going through two
mitoses in, uh,

00:25:09.811 --> 00:25:10.880
in sequence.
 

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.615
And as a result of that,
each haploid gamete is getting

00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:17.173
one original chromosome,
or the other,

00:25:17.173 --> 00:25:18.349
but not both.
 

00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:20.440
That's a cartoon of meiosis.
 

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.065
Meiosis is actually much more
complicated than that,

00:25:24.065 --> 00:25:28.328
and is much more precise than
I'm able to indicate with these

00:25:28.328 --> 00:25:30.318
kinds of stick diagrams.
 

00:25:30.318 --> 00:25:35.938
But for today's purposes the
main thing to remember about it

00:25:35.938 --> 00:25:41.461
is that meiosis takes a diploid
parent and from the diploid

00:25:41.461 --> 00:25:45.078
parent generates haploid
gametes,

00:25:45.078 --> 00:25:49.920
and each haploid gamete is
getting one original chromosome,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.599
or the other,
but it doesn't get both.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.595
There's a great paper that was
written back in 1907 by a

00:26:00.595 --> 00:26:03.790
geneticist on this issue:
Does the behavior of

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.490
chromosomes explain Mendel's
Laws?

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.640
And it does.
 

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.253
So Mendel's First Law is that
if you have two alleles,

00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:18.044
two members of a gene pair,
when they segregate into the

00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:21.440
gametes, one goes into each
gamete;

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.838
that's Mendel's Law of
Segregation.

00:26:24.838 --> 00:26:28.223
So half of the gametes from a
heterozygous Aa,

00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:32.134
will carry the A allele,
and half of them will have a

00:26:32.134 --> 00:26:33.640
little a allele.
 

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.676
So this is the law that allows
us to predict what the genotype

00:26:37.676 --> 00:26:40.058
ratio should be in the
offspring,

00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:44.152
and that allows us to notice
any deviations from that

00:26:44.152 --> 00:26:45.490
genotype ratio.
 

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.950
So I'm jumping ahead a little
bit here to Punnett diagrams.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:54.230
Just make a note in your head
that this fact of segregation is

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:59.597
the basis for our being able to
predict what the offspring will

00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:03.839
be like if we know what the
parents are like;

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:06.548
at least it's part of it.
 

00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:10.314
So if you have two
heterozygotes who are mating

00:27:10.314 --> 00:27:11.869
with each other--
 

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.740
so the male gametes have either
A or a,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.769
and the female gametes have
either A or a,

00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:23.540
it is Mendel's Law of
Segregation which tells us that

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.259
we can expect those gametes to
be equally likely.

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:29.269
The probability is 50% in each
case.

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:32.708
When they then come together to
make a zygote that's going to

00:27:32.708 --> 00:27:35.917
grow up to be the offspring,
then these--we just multiply

00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:37.808
these probabilities together.
 

00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:44.077
So .5 times .5 gives us .25,
and each of these kinds of

00:27:44.077 --> 00:27:47.910
zygotes is equally likely;
25%.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.380
However there was a reason that
we wrote A and a.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.619
If A is dominant,
that is say it's brown eyes,

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:59.577
and a is recessive,
say it's blue eyes--and

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:04.477
remember our baby with
issues--then the ratio here is

00:28:04.477 --> 00:28:05.420
3:1.
 

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.744
That's only true because--it's
3:1 because in these three cases

00:28:10.744 --> 00:28:14.609
we have a A, and in this one
case we don't.

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:15.380
So the ratio is 3:1.
 

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.807
It was this observation of 3:1
ratios in the offspring of

00:28:22.807 --> 00:28:26.652
heterozygote crosses that caused
Mendel to postulate the idea

00:28:26.652 --> 00:28:29.297
that hey,
some genes are dominant and

00:28:29.297 --> 00:28:30.980
some genes are recessive.
 

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.513
If a gene's dominant,
you can see that fact in the

00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:36.912
phenotype;
you can see that the allele is

00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:38.240
present in the phenotype.
 

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.318
If it's recessive,
you can't see the presence of

00:28:41.318 --> 00:28:43.348
the gene in the heterozygote.
 

00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.940
Its presence is covered up by
the dominant one.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.497
Mendel's Second Law:
What happens when we're looking

00:28:55.497 --> 00:29:00.390
at two genes and they're on
different chromosomes?

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:04.704
Well Mendel's Second Law
basically says that the events

00:29:04.704 --> 00:29:09.260
that occur at the different
chromosomes are independent of

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.460
each other.
 

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.222
So genes that are sitting on
one chromosome are going to be

00:29:14.222 --> 00:29:17.921
assorting independently to genes
that are sitting on other

00:29:17.921 --> 00:29:18.960
chromosomes.
 

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:26.806
So in this picture you can see
that if we have Aa--and this

00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:33.598
would be a Aa heterozygote;
this is a Bb heterozygote.

00:29:33.598 --> 00:29:36.318
They are depicted as already
having been copied.

00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:36.690
Okay?
 

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.691
So they've been duplicated so
that they can start going

00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:43.210
through the process of meiosis.
 

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.259
And what's going to happen is
that we're going to pull them

00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:46.680
apart.
 

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.397
We're going to make four
gametes out of each of the

00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:52.720
chromosomes.
 

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.574
This combination,
where you get AB and ab,

00:29:57.574 --> 00:30:03.967
is just as likely as this
combination, where you get Ab

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:05.269
and aB.
 

00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.656
Okay?
 

00:30:05.656 --> 00:30:10.075
So that's tracking what happens
when you have genes on two

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:13.950
different chromosomes that are
forming gametes.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.829
That's Mendel's Second Law.
 

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:23.906
So meiosis is capable of
producing genotypes that are

00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:27.759
different from the parental
genotype.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.348
I'll pause for a moment
there--I'm not just going to

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:30.440
keep running through this
slide--

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.496
because I want to tell you that
this is the essence of sexual

00:30:34.496 --> 00:30:35.509
reproduction.
 

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:39.075
The fact that the offspring
gene--genotypes are different

00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:42.958
from the parental genotypes is
the essential evolutionary fact

00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:43.848
about sex.
 

00:30:43.848 --> 00:30:47.490
It can be achieved in a lot of
different ways,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.506
but it means that sex produces
offspring that are not copies of

00:30:52.506 --> 00:30:56.183
the parent;
they are all different from the

00:30:56.183 --> 00:30:56.818
parent.
 

00:30:56.818 --> 00:30:58.990
And there are two genetic
mechanisms that do it.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.608
I just showed you the first one.
 

00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:03.425
If you've got the genes on
different chromosomes,

00:31:03.425 --> 00:31:05.068
they assort independently.
 

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:07.536
If they're on the same
gene--chromosome,

00:31:07.536 --> 00:31:09.369
you can have crossing over.
 

00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:10.910
Okay?
 

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:16.223
So crossing over means that
chromosome parts are exchanged

00:31:16.223 --> 00:31:19.394
during meiosis,
and it produces new

00:31:19.394 --> 00:31:20.980
combinations.
 

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.880
Like this.
 

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.894
It's easiest to show you just
with a diagram,

00:31:23.894 --> 00:31:25.038
rather than with words.
 

00:31:25.038 --> 00:31:30.431
So when we've made the copies
of the chromosomes and they are

00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:33.761
lined up--
I think this is in Prophase 1,

00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:36.838
if I've got my phases right in
meiosis--

00:31:36.838 --> 00:31:43.304
it is possible that there will
be a break and then a rejoining

00:31:43.304 --> 00:31:48.259
at a certain spot,
and this will be done where the

00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:51.078
DNA sequences are very similar.
 

00:31:51.078 --> 00:31:53.535
So the chromosomes can break
and be rejoined,

00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:56.660
and the product of that is
gametes that are different.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.150
These are recombinant gametes
generated by crossing over.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.349
These combinations,
this kind of genetic variation,

00:32:10.349 --> 00:32:14.848
is something that's going on in
every generation.

00:32:14.848 --> 00:32:18.259
The estimate for the human
genome is that actually in order

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:21.132
to go through meiosis,
there must be a crossing-over

00:32:21.132 --> 00:32:23.491
event,
and it is thought that every

00:32:23.491 --> 00:32:27.509
human chromosome experiences one
crossing-over event every

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:32.615
generation, roughly;
probably true for most

00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:34.358
organisms.
 

00:32:34.358 --> 00:32:35.910
So these things are continually
being shuffled.

00:32:39.038 --> 00:32:42.118
And the point of that is that
there are two mechanisms of

00:32:42.118 --> 00:32:43.000
recombination.
 

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.400
Remember this.
 

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.720
Okay?
 

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.625
When we say that the genes
recombine, they do it both

00:32:49.625 --> 00:32:53.906
because the chromosomes get
shuffled, and because there is

00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:55.259
crossing over.
 

00:32:55.259 --> 00:32:59.135
The crossing over generates new
combinations within chromosomes

00:32:59.135 --> 00:33:02.574
and the chromosome assortment
generates new combinations

00:33:02.574 --> 00:33:04.640
within the genome;
both things are going on.

00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:12.584
Now mutations are also going on
in every generation,

00:33:12.584 --> 00:33:15.788
and they produce changes in DNA
sequences.

00:33:15.788 --> 00:33:18.838
Some of them make genes that
are functional.

00:33:18.838 --> 00:33:21.318
Some mutated genes have
improved.

00:33:21.318 --> 00:33:24.420
Many don't, many have worse
function.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.140
A lot of them are neutral.
 

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.330
And it's mutations that occur
in the germline--that is,

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.345
in the cells that will form
eggs and sperm--that get

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.058
transmitted to offspring.
 

00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:38.200
They have evolutionary
significance.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.983
So they change the information
that's transmitted over

00:33:42.983 --> 00:33:44.788
evolutionary time.
 

00:33:44.788 --> 00:33:47.667
Mutations that occur in somatic
cells are things that lead to

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:48.098
cancer.
 

00:33:48.098 --> 00:33:50.934
Cancer is a mutational process,
and every cancer is a little

00:33:50.934 --> 00:33:53.961
evolutionary process that occurs
just within the lifetime of the

00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:55.019
person who has it.
 

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.784
Ultimately, if you go back,
through the history of life,

00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:08.000
mutations are where all genetic
variation came from.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.440
So it's important to understand
basically what's going on here.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.820
We refer, on the one hand,
to point mutations.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.250
That's where you just change
one nucleotide,

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.188
and there's a category--there
are categories of point

00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:19.980
mutations.
 

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.969
You can have substitutions,
you can have deletions,

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:30.682
and you can have--a deletion of
an entire codon will not cause a

00:34:30.682 --> 00:34:34.840
change in the downstream amino
acids.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.684
So if you take out three
nucleotides at once,

00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:41.304
there won't be any change in
the coding for the remaining

00:34:41.304 --> 00:34:42.340
amino acids.
 

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.574
But if you take out one or two,
you're shifting the reading

00:34:46.574 --> 00:34:47.159
frame.
 

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:50.503
So if you have a deletion of
one nucleotide or two

00:34:50.503 --> 00:34:53.574
nucleotides, it changes
everything downstream,

00:34:53.574 --> 00:34:54.940
from that point.
 

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.929
So one or two deletions can
have really big effects on the

00:34:58.929 --> 00:35:01.869
information content of the whole
genome.

00:35:01.869 --> 00:35:04.469
We call those frameshift
mutations.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:07.030
Mutations also occur at higher
levels.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.806
You can have chromosomal
mutations where you delete

00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:11.940
entire genes.
 

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.628
So if I say we delete B,
I want you to think now that

00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:16.800
we're taking out maybe 3000
nucleotides.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.960
The whole gene disappears;
everything from the start codon

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.989
to the stop codon.
 

00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:24.608
We can duplicate a gene,
so we get two copies,

00:35:24.608 --> 00:35:26.539
or we can invert them.
 

00:35:26.539 --> 00:35:29.119
These are very important
evolutionary processes.

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:33.307
If you duplicate a gene,
you can use the old copy to

00:35:33.307 --> 00:35:37.989
keep things working while you
innovate with a new copy.

00:35:37.989 --> 00:35:40.619
So gene duplications are really
important.

00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:44.619
Your genome has been completely
duplicated twice.

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:46.340
We can see that in the HOX
genes;

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.000
you'll see that in a few
lectures.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.510
But in the course of vertebra
evolution,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.059
once back about with the
hagfishes,

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:55.168
in the Agnatha,
and then once between the

00:35:55.168 --> 00:35:58.070
Agnatha and the higher fishes,
the entire genome was

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.000
duplicated, and it is thought
that this duplication of

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.260
information may very well have
been associated with the fact

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.135
that there was radiation and a
generation of a lot of

00:36:07.135 --> 00:36:11.369
morphological complexities,
because we had duplicated the

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.639
entire library.
 

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:16.018
You could keep one of them
going, to keep everything

00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:19.860
running, and you could use the
other one for innovation.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.840
So duplications are important.
 

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:30.219
Now, to get back to John,
Jill, and the baby with issues.

00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:33.596
Remember I said that John came
from an island where the

00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:35.909
population had a 1% gene
frequency.

00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:39.920
Well we need to think about the
whole population then.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.920
Now I want you to think about
an out-crossing,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.300
sexual diploid population that
produces haploid gametes--

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.750
it could be the population of
Connecticut,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.268
it could be the population of
New Haven,

00:36:49.268 --> 00:36:53.192
the population of Pitcairn
Island--and focus on one gene

00:36:53.192 --> 00:36:55.260
that occurs as two alleles.
 

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.909
Okay?
 

00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:00.518
We'll call them A and a.
 

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:02.929
We've got Mendel's Laws going
on.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:06.217
So we have random fair
assort--assortment of alleles

00:37:06.217 --> 00:37:08.643
into gametes,
we have random fusion of

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:11.322
gametes into zygotes,
and we can put that into a

00:37:11.322 --> 00:37:12.199
Punnett diagram.
 

00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:16.606
So this would be for
heterozygotes,

00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:19.329
Aa, mating with Aa.
 

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:22.914
If we look at it as a
population diagram,

00:37:22.914 --> 00:37:26.409
then the frequencies can be
anything.

00:37:26.409 --> 00:37:29.268
It doesn't have to be
heterozygote frequencies.

00:37:29.268 --> 00:37:31.929
We can just say if there's
random mating of individuals in

00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:34.813
this population;
some of them are homozygote,

00:37:34.813 --> 00:37:37.150
some of them are heterozygotes.
 

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:42.380
We have a population of eggs
and a population of sperm,

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:48.193
and the frequency of A we will
call p, and the frequency of a

00:37:48.193 --> 00:37:49.840
we'll call q.
 

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.054
And it's important to
remember--and this is a place

00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:56.974
where people just getting into
it often get fouled up--p and q

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:59.289
can be anything between 0 and 1.
 

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:00.420
They're not 50%.
 

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.389
Okay?
 

00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:03.130
They can be anything between 0
and 1.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.409
These genes can occur at
arbitrary different frequencies;

00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:08.130
in the general case.
 

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:14.050
Well p plus q has got to equal
1, because we only have two

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:17.083
possibilities;
and that's just the definition

00:38:17.083 --> 00:38:18.268
of frequencies.
 

00:38:18.268 --> 00:38:23.289
The frequencies of the kinds of
zygotes they will form are

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:27.782
p^(2), 2pq and q^(2),
and those frequencies also add

00:38:27.782 --> 00:38:28.840
up to 1.
 

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.900
The assumptions behind those
statements are that meiosis is

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.168
fair--
so it's just like flipping a

00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:38.525
coin, it's 50% probability
whether you'll get one or the

00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:41.090
other allele in any particular
mating--

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.204
that mating is random,
that there are large

00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:45.282
populations,
and that there's no selection

00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.469
and there's no migration.
 

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:51.360
So this is kind of an ideal Gas
Law for biology,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.730
and such laws are very useful
in physics and chemistry,

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.650
and this one is particularly
useful in evolution.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.804
It tells us that if these
assumptions hold,

00:39:00.804 --> 00:39:05.237
then in every generation you
can expect those proportions of

00:39:05.237 --> 00:39:08.050
genotypes;
no mutation.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:12.429
Well what does it mean?
 

00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:16.248
It means that if you start in
one generation with frequencies

00:39:16.248 --> 00:39:20.507
p and q,
and you go through that kind of

00:39:20.507 --> 00:39:23.795
mating,
you get zygotes with these

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:27.704
frequencies,
and in the next generation you

00:39:27.704 --> 00:39:33.190
get the same gamete frequencies;
nothing changes.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:37.217
It's kind of funny that you
would place a lot of emphasis on

00:39:37.217 --> 00:39:39.880
a law that says that nothing
changes.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.394
But in fact it's extremely
important, because it means

00:39:44.394 --> 00:39:48.994
that, at the level of a
population, genetic information

00:39:48.994 --> 00:39:50.869
doesn't disappear.
 

00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:53.284
Gene frequencies stay the same,
and that means that the

00:39:53.284 --> 00:39:55.608
population gets replicated,
the whole population gets

00:39:55.608 --> 00:39:56.280
replicated.
 

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.860
That allows information to
accumulate.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.405
If this were not true,
then the information that had

00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:10.436
been accumulated would get
eroded by just the basic process

00:40:10.436 --> 00:40:11.550
of genetics.
 

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.400
It turns out that genetics and
random mating,

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.369
and, uh, the whole structure of
the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions,

00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:23.554
is set up in such a way that
information is preserved at the

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.400
level of the population.
 

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.260
That makes evolution possible.
 

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.605
If we didn't have that
retention of information,

00:40:30.605 --> 00:40:34.233
then you couldn't tweak it;
it would get eroded by

00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:37.079
processes other than natural
selection.

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:40.163
So it's kind of an inheritance
mechanism at the whole

00:40:40.163 --> 00:40:41.289
population level.
 

00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:44.646
And, by the way,
it minimizes conflicts among

00:40:44.646 --> 00:40:48.309
genes about who gets into the
next generation.

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:51.931
And genetic conflict will be
something that we examine in

00:40:51.931 --> 00:40:56.112
more detail later on;
particularly interesting in the

00:40:56.112 --> 00:41:01.239
context of evolutionary medicine
and reproductive biology.

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:04.139
Okay, let's go back to our
problem.

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:11.030
Jill and John have this baby,
and the baby is at issue.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:15.643
So Jill's got--Jill is a--I'm
now going to use the words,

00:41:15.643 --> 00:41:20.010
to drive them home--Jill is a
recessive homozygote.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:24.039
She's got two copies of a.
 

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:30.338
John could be either a dominant
homozygote, or he could be a

00:41:30.338 --> 00:41:35.000
heterozygote;
he's got brown eyes.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.250
The baby's got blue eyes,
and is a recessive homozygote.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:39.969
Should John be worried?
 

00:41:42.989 --> 00:41:44.059
Well here's the hint.
 

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:46.501
This is the one new piece of
information I'm going to give

00:41:46.501 --> 00:41:46.760
you.
 

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.945
We're going to assume that
John's genotype is a random

00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:54.394
sample of those on the island,
and therefore that

00:41:54.394 --> 00:42:00.559
q^(2)--that's the frequency of
aa-- is 0.01.

00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:06.987
So if q^(2) is 0.01,
what is q?

00:42:06.987 --> 00:42:08.059
.1.
 

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:13.829
Right; 10% probability.
 

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:15.869
What's the probability that
John is a heterozygote?

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.409
This requires having picked up
information very rapidly.

00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:26.119
It's 2pq.
 

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:27.639
Okay?
 

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:28.900
Those are the heterozygotes.
 

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:38.699
The probability that John is a
dominant homozygote is p^(2);

00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:42.380
p is .9;
p^(2) is .81;

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.699
81% probability that John is a
homozygote.

00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:52.110
Should John be worried;
 

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.380
I mean, just on genetic
grounds, heh?

00:43:01.989 --> 00:43:07.585
The only way that that baby
could be John's child is if he

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.550
is a heterozygote.
 

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.699
2pq is 18%;
 

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:19.550
p^(2) is 81%.
 

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.989
Okay?
 

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:27.474
So I did that just to give you
a problem that has a little bit

00:43:27.474 --> 00:43:31.989
of human content to it,
that is answered by genetics

00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:35.300
and by the concepts that we were
playing with today.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.289
Yes?
 

00:43:36.289 --> 00:43:40.432
Student: The 81%,
does that just mean it's not,

00:43:40.432 --> 00:43:43.873
there's no way,
or there's a high probability

00:43:43.873 --> 00:43:45.750
that there's no way?
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:50.224
Prof: Well if he,
in fact, is a homozygote,

00:43:50.224 --> 00:43:55.063
there is no way that that child
is his, unless he--no,

00:43:55.063 --> 00:43:56.800
there is a way.
 

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.159
He could've had a mutation in
the gene that turned it from a

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:03.264
brown into a blue gene,
and that could've found its way

00:44:03.264 --> 00:44:05.360
into the sperm that fathered the
child;

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.840
and the probability of that
happening is about 10^(-9).

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.579
Okay.
 

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.360
See if you can explain that.
 

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.010
Take--print this list out.
 

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.541
Sit down at lunch with a
colleague from class and see

00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:28.239
what you can't explain.
 

00:44:28.239 --> 00:44:31.699
Take that term into section and
get it explained.

00:44:31.699 --> 00:44:33.219
Okay?
 

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:35.119
Next time, Adaptive Evolution.

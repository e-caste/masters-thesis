00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.994
Prof: Last time,
as you'll remember,

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:08.240
we talked about a general
overview of the three pandemics,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.790
as well as the impact of the
plague bacterium--

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.320
which we have here,
Yersinia pestis,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.280
the star of our show--on the
individual human body.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.167
This morning I'd like to talk
about community responses to

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:32.814
bubonic plague,
first in terms of unorganized,

00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.500
spontaneous responses.
 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.791
And then I'd like to look at
something really decisive,

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.130
which was organized community
responses;

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.978
that is, the first form of
successful public health ever

00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:52.474
devised, and the first victory
over a human disease,

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.590
over bubonic plague.
 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.610
So, that's where we're headed
this morning.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.337
And just so you'll remember,
plague is not a disease

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:04.468
entirely of the past.
 

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:08.120
The third pandemic reached
these shores,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.549
and I wanted to remind you that
plague is still with us.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.760
These are the areas in the
United States where plague,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.938
at the present day,
is endemic among wild rodents,

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:26.543
and it causes every year a
small trickle of cases of

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:32.024
bubonic plague,
usually in the southwest of the

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.890
United States.
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.828
Well, in terms of community
responses, probably the first

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:45.910
and most spontaneous of all was
flight.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.790
Panic and fear of sudden death
led people to depart in haste.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.434
As Defoe makes clear,
those who were the first to

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:03.218
flee were people of means,
and those often included the

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:06.709
authorities,
and physicians themselves,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.711
and clergymen,
thereby increasing disruption

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.004
and chaos,
and magnifying the sense of

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:14.680
terror.
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.150
I imagine you could--for an
equivalent,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.605
if you were to wake up tomorrow
morning and hear that there was

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:26.558
something terrible on the
medical front happening in New

00:02:26.558 --> 00:02:29.746
Haven,
and that DeStefano and Rick

00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:33.030
Levin had taken the last train
out,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.008
I can imagine some of the
responses that you might have.

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.519
In any case,
let's remember the atmosphere

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.430
in a city visited by the plague.
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.613
Last time you heard a
description of Florence in 1348,

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:54.502
provided by Boccaccio,
and you're now reading about

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:57.340
Defoe and London in 1665.
 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.240
So, let me give you a different
and also dramatic example.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.468
And that was Naples in 1656.
 

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:10.090
Naples, one of the largest
cities in Europe,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.736
especially vulnerable because
of its urban poverty and

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.327
overcrowding,
and its status as one of

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:20.878
Europe's great port cities.
 

00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:24.777
It had, in 1656,
the year of this terrible

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:28.837
visitation,
a population of 500,000--an

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.788
enormous city by seventeenth
century standards--

00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:39.220
and 300,000 people died no less
in this visitation.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.740
Every activity in Naples ceased
at the time.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.699
There was general unemployment
and universal hunger.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.663
The living--as in the
clichï¿½--weren't sufficiently

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:55.940
numerous to bury the dead,
and I mean that literally.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.413
Cadavers were left,
not only in doors,

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:01.949
but in all public places.
 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:07.498
In the end, some 60,000 bodies
were burned in pyres,

00:04:07.498 --> 00:04:13.049
and 20,000 more were
unceremoniously dumped into the

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:13.919
sea.
 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.245
Imagine a great city,
then, with the intolerable

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:23.711
stench of decomposition,
with dogs, vultures and ravens

00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.130
picking at cadavers,
and a total breakdown of law

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.920
and order in every public
service.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.004
Imagine too the flight of
people, the sense that the end

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.500
of the world was at hand.
 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.937
And indeed one of the popular
images of the plague in art was

00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:47.463
a black figure on horseback,
one of the dread horsemen of

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:52.250
the Apocalypse who had come on
this final day of reckoning.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.069
So, it was from places like
this that everyone who could

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:01.223
took to the roads,
often with the fear in their

00:05:01.223 --> 00:05:05.439
hearts that God and his anger
were in hot pursuit.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.930
So, the first spontaneous
reaction was to escape.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.360
But remember what we said about
humoralism, Hippocrates and

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.110
Galen.
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.869
And if you'll remember then,
looking back,

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:24.637
medical theory at the time
sanctioned this particular

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:28.028
reaction, or led to it
logically.

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.480
Because epidemics and humoral
theory,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.798
as you now know,
were caused by an imbalance in

00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:37.355
the humors,
triggered by a poisoned air,

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:40.718
one of the "six
unnaturals,"

00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:41.810
a miasma.
 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.697
In other words,
the disease was tied to the air

00:05:45.697 --> 00:05:49.872
around a given locality,
and so it made perfect good

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:53.870
sense, by the medical theory
that people had inherited,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.766
that they should escape the
locale and therefore the

00:05:57.766 --> 00:05:59.220
poisonous miasma.
 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.720
The response of populations was
mediated by the ideas that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.812
people had in their heads,
by the ways an epidemic was

00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:10.509
understood,
or--in a fashionable modern

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.730
phrase--
how it was socially constructed.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.223
Now, orthodoxy was spawned in
particular with an idea of

00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:25.930
what's called miasmatism;
that is to say there was a

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.569
miasma, which is derived from
the Greek word for corrupted or

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:31.420
defiled.
 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.726
A miasma was a corruption,
a defilement or poisoning of

00:06:36.726 --> 00:06:37.709
the air.
 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.408
Poisonous atoms,
emitted by rotting organic

00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:46.870
matter of infected people and
the objects they had touched,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.440
were released,
became an effluvia in the air,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.990
which was poisoned thereby.
 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.904
And once the air had been made
poisonous, it could be absorbed

00:06:57.904 --> 00:07:01.370
by anyone in a locality--through
the pores in the skin,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.490
perhaps, or by being inhaled.
 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.990
So, the body would then be
poisoned like the air.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.000
And, so, the search in the city
was for a corrupting agent.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.184
What did people who had this
idea, this medical philosophy of

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.850
bubonic plague--where would
their suspicious alight?

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.060
Well, first they would fall on
foul odors;

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.790
and these were plentiful in an
early modern city.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.211
There was the night soil that
people hurled from their windows

00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:38.560
and doors, the offal that
butchers swept into the streets.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.204
There were the products,
the noxious products,

00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:46.093
of stinking trades,
like metal or leatherworking,

00:07:46.093 --> 00:07:49.089
or the retting of hemp and so
on.

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:54.298
This meant that the logical
consequence would be urban

00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:55.379
cleanups.
 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:59.259
And, so, authorities ordered
cleanups.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:04.108
They collected refuse,
closed down certain workshops

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:07.307
and trades,
cleansed the streets,

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:12.326
halted work in abattoirs,
and ordered the prompt burial

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:13.500
of cadavers.
 

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.564
Furthermore,
in Christian Europe water had a

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:22.197
symbolic, if we like,
ritual cleansing attached to

00:08:22.197 --> 00:08:22.860
it.
 

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.803
It was a purifying quality
because of its role in baptism,

00:08:27.803 --> 00:08:30.319
where it cleansed the soul.
 

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.159
So, throughout Europe,
cities ordered their streets

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.308
cleansed with water in times of
plague.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:41.048
They did more though than just
cleanse the streets.

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:44.889
They tried also to cleanse the
air directly.

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:51.123
There were bonfires that were
set, especially with aromatic

00:08:51.123 --> 00:08:54.668
wood like pine,
or with sulfur.

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:59.336
And there was the firing of
cannon, with the idea that this

00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:01.509
too would purify the air.
 

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:05.720
Those were authorities who took
those measures.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.509
There were also ideas of
individual self-protection.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:15.613
And since the cause of the
plague was this horrible

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:20.613
poisoned air around you,
it was a good idea to have a

00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:24.620
little vial of aromatic spices
around your neck,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.485
or it might be vinegar;
and tobacco had a certain

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.605
popularity, as people smoked
their way to health in the

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.360
seventeenth century.
 

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.181
It was also wise to shut up
windows and doors,

00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:43.086
if you were indoors,
to prevent the poison from

00:09:43.086 --> 00:09:45.038
entering your home.
 

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:49.100
The garments of people who were
infected also fell under

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.504
suspicion,
because the miasmatic poison

00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:56.971
was held to cling to them,
just as you know in your own

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:01.232
experience that the scent of
tobacco or perfume can cling to

00:10:01.232 --> 00:10:04.769
a dress,
a sweater, a shirt.

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:09.035
Well, for this reason,
people also tried to protect

00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:12.620
themselves with special plague
costumes.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.590
You can see you'd be very
handsome dressed like that.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.293
And the idea was that the
costume would be waxed,

00:10:21.293 --> 00:10:25.769
because that would prevent
anything from adhering to it.

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:28.567
In this case they weren't
thinking about fleas,

00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:31.669
they were thinking about the
atoms of the corrupted,

00:10:31.669 --> 00:10:33.070
defiled atmosphere.
 

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.570
And you'll note that there's a
prominent feature;

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.009
is the beak here.
 

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.538
And it's not because it's a
bird.

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:46.056
The idea was that in the beak
you would fill it with herbs

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:49.940
that were spicy and would
protect you that way.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.350
And you'll notice that the
person is carrying a rod.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.840
That's not for instructive
purposes.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.870
That's to keep people away,
at a safe distance from you.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.470
So, what better way than to be
a bit like a verger?

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.370
Or let me show you another
example.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.976
And here you might have your
own brazier of coal that's

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:15.004
burning,
and you might have sulfur or

00:11:15.004 --> 00:11:18.980
something else that would scent
the atmosphere around you.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.485
And always, of course,
you would have your stick to

00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:25.639
keep people at a good safe
distance to you.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:28.240
You also took other precautions.
 

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.158
You would approach a plague
victim,

00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:33.168
if you suspected that you were
encountering one,

00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:37.456
upwind, and it was said that
plague victims could be

00:11:37.456 --> 00:11:42.250
approached if you stayed upwind
and kept your distance.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.120
But for those who approached
downwind,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.548
illness was likely,
and the outcome would depend on

00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:54.005
a body's susceptibility,
on its organic disposition,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:57.833
that would determine the
balance of the four bodily

00:11:57.833 --> 00:11:58.600
humors.
 

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.787
If the balance was precarious,
any small influence that

00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:06.200
disturbed the equilibrium could
be fatal,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.179
such as fear,
a dissolute lifestyle,

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:12.428
a sudden chill.
 

00:12:12.428 --> 00:12:17.090
But this idea of cleansing,
in early modern Europe,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.870
could also have more sinister
and ritualistic possibilities.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.344
And these were derived from
ancient popular ideas of magic,

00:12:28.344 --> 00:12:32.120
of God's anger and punishment
for sin.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.600
In other words,
the contamination,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.658
it was thought by many people,
could have moral causes,

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:41.590
which had stirred the divine
wrath.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.229
So, a vigilant community might
well try to identify and cast

00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:50.788
out those who were morally
responsible for the calamity.

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:54.120
Sin could be the abuse of food
and drink;

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.758
excessive sleep and idleness;
immoderate, unnatural or sinful

00:13:00.758 --> 00:13:03.349
sex;
or blasphemous religious

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.168
practices and beliefs.
 

00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:09.524
Let me show you this rather
terrifying slide by Jules Elie

00:13:09.524 --> 00:13:12.808
Delauney, of 1869,
which is called "The

00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:14.720
Plague of Rome."
 

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.431
And it refers to the Rome
plague in the seventeenth

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:20.509
century, a major epidemic.
 

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:25.892
And what we see here is the
Angel of God pointing out to the

00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:29.450
avenging angel the home of a
sinner,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:34.210
and the plague is about to
destroy the sinners inside.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.970
This is the idea that people
had in their heads.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.168
So, with that idea,
who might be inside?

00:13:43.168 --> 00:13:47.629
Well, suspicion fell on
prostitutes, for example,

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:52.833
and they were rounded up in
many places and expelled from

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:56.178
towns, and brothels were closed.
 

00:13:56.178 --> 00:14:03.921
It might fall also on infidels,
religious dissenters,

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.750
Jews and gypsies.
 

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.854
There might be attacks on
foreigners and outsiders,

00:14:10.854 --> 00:14:15.205
witches and lepers who were
already suspected of being

00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:16.928
grievous sinners.
 

00:14:16.928 --> 00:14:21.865
Or for people who had the view
that predestination could be

00:14:21.865 --> 00:14:25.269
seen by your outward success in
life,

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:30.750
whether you were the elect or
not, was visible by your worldly

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.061
wealth,
then beggars,

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.860
by their poverty and
misfortunes,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.719
were seen as having already
received a first installment of

00:14:41.719 --> 00:14:46.158
the punishment they deserved for
their secret sins.

00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:51.241
So, towns throughout Europe
closed themselves to outsiders,

00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:55.799
and inside the towns
undesirables might be rounded up

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:57.288
and expelled.
 

00:14:57.288 --> 00:15:00.485
Or worse still,
in some places there were

00:15:00.485 --> 00:15:04.080
stonings, lynchings,
burnings at the stake;

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.269
full-scale pogroms,
or what we might today call

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:10.000
ethnic cleansing.
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.399
The poisoning hysteria
reinforced this idea,

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:20.899
and there was often an hysteria
that the poisoning and the

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:24.769
atmosphere was not a natural
event but a crime.

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:27.950
And there were anointers called
"untori,"

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.940
or poisoners,
who were out to destroy people.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.230
This was a diabolical plot,
and so a hunt was often on to

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.120
find the culprits.
 

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.220
Let me give two famous and
notorious examples,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.544
a first and early one at
Strasbourg in the fourteenth

00:15:46.544 --> 00:15:49.035
century,
where rumor had it--you'll

00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.279
remember in the fourteenth
century,

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:56.308
the Jews were cast out of the
Iberian Peninsula,

00:15:56.308 --> 00:16:02.703
and the panicked fear was that
they were carrying out a plot as

00:16:02.703 --> 00:16:09.099
vengeance to destroy Christian
Europe by poisoning the wells of

00:16:09.099 --> 00:16:10.750
Christendom.
 

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.211
So, crowds at Strasbourg
rounded up 8,000 Jews,

00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:20.740
took them to the Jewish
cemetery and burned them alive.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.139
Or let me tell you another
example from Milan in 1630,

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:29.705
and not really a more cheerful
one at all, although on a

00:16:29.705 --> 00:16:31.200
smaller scale.
 

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.220
And it's told in one of
the--two actually--

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.288
of the great works by the
inventor of the Italian novel,

00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:44.441
and one of the great European
novelists of the nineteenth

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:47.259
century,
Alexander Manzoni.

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:49.798
The novel is called The
Betrothed.

00:16:49.798 --> 00:16:54.309
And he also wrote a historical
work called The Column of

00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:57.110
Infamy--that is to say,
Milan.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.325
Here's a picture of the event I
want to tell you about,

00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:05.150
as described by Manzoni,
acting as a historian.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:10.078
The city of Milan in 1630 was
at war with Spain,

00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:15.299
and to their misfortune,
four hapless Spaniards were

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:19.760
found in the city,
just as plague was breaking

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.298
out, and they were accused of
starting it by spreading

00:17:24.298 --> 00:17:29.519
poisonous ointment on the doors
of the houses of the city.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:33.711
Under torture,
they confessed to the crime and

00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:38.932
were convicted of high treason,
and then sentenced to have

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:43.019
their hands cut off,
to be broken on the wheel,

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:45.730
and then burned at the stake.
 

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.636
So, at the site of their
execution--and hence the

00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:53.868
term--we have this,
which is the Column of Infamy.

00:17:53.868 --> 00:17:58.721
You can see the prisoners being
brought, and you can see they're

00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:02.954
being broken on the wheel,
and all the rest of it in the

00:18:02.954 --> 00:18:03.880
picture.
 

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.818
And you can also see that there
was erected--here's the chief

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:13.480
criminal, Jacob Mora.
 

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.410
And on the site in Milan,
after the plague,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.857
a plaque was posted--the column
was meant to deter anyone else

00:18:23.857 --> 00:18:27.700
from ever doing something so
diabolical--

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.295
and this plaque was placed in
Latin saying what had happened

00:18:32.295 --> 00:18:35.098
and what the punishment had
been,

00:18:35.098 --> 00:18:38.210
and warning people to
commemorate this event;

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.740
that no house should ever be
built on this site.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.490
And this is the inscription on
the plaque.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.960
So, those were reactions.
 

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.798
Another reaction was one of
mass repentance to propitiate an

00:18:59.798 --> 00:19:01.769
angry divinity.
 

00:19:01.769 --> 00:19:04.759
And to do that,
how did you go about it?

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:08.838
One way was by outdoor
processions, confessing your

00:19:08.838 --> 00:19:12.510
sins, repenting,
and urging your neighbors and

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.509
everyone else you encountered to
do the same.

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:20.450
There were religious revivals.
 

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.817
The plague years were marked in
particular by a new cult of

00:19:24.817 --> 00:19:27.422
saints,
the ones held to be most

00:19:27.422 --> 00:19:31.974
willing to intercede on behalf
of humanity and to divert the

00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:33.210
divine anger.
 

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.078
There was a great cult of the
Virgin Mary.

00:19:36.078 --> 00:19:39.420
There was a cult of Saint
Christopher.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.160
But in particular,
of two new saints who had an

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.818
extraordinary vogue during the
plague year.

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:52.633
The first was Saint Sebastian,
and the other was Saint Rocco

00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:54.210
or Saint Roch.
 

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.410
Here is Saint Sebastian.
 

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.210
And if you think of the
iconography,

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.098
you'll remember that when we
talked in the first lecture

00:20:04.098 --> 00:20:08.188
about Homer,
we saw that Apollo took arrows

00:20:08.188 --> 00:20:12.400
to shoot the plague,
to destroy the Greeks.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.869
And so there has been a
constant idea symbolically of

00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:22.442
arrows as symbols of the plague,
and Saint Sebastian is someone

00:20:22.442 --> 00:20:27.140
who was willing to give his life
to save his fellows,

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.500
by absorbing the arrows into
his own flesh.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.487
He was martyred by the arrows,
and this was said to be his way

00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:38.450
of defending humanity.
 

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:43.159
So, there was a great vogue in
this era of Saint Sebastian,

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:47.950
who was invoked to help human
beings to avoid the plague.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.230
Another was Saint Rocco.
 

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.308
Now, who was he?
 

00:20:52.308 --> 00:20:56.118
He was an aristocrat from
Montpellier,

00:20:56.118 --> 00:21:00.750
and according to legend he gave
his riches away to the poor,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.450
and set off on a pilgrimage to
Italy,

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.460
where he had the great
misfortune of arriving--

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.390
and you know it was a
misfortune--in 1348,

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.430
at the onset of the Black Death.
 

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:18.000
He, however,
fell ill, but survived.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.940
And then he stayed to tend to
the ill, only eventually to

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.969
return to France where he faced
arrest and finally died in

00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:28.940
prison.
 

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.511
Like Saint Sebastian,
he was a man who was held to be

00:21:33.511 --> 00:21:38.260
willing to sacrifice his body,
his wealth and his life,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.900
to save the people of God.
 

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.544
So, images of these saints--and
we'll look at this next time

00:21:44.544 --> 00:21:47.509
when we look at the artistic
representations,

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:50.880
the legacy of bubonic plague on
the arts--

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.470
images of these saints,
in particular,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:59.029
proliferated in this period--at
the entrances to houses,

00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:02.509
in people's bedrooms,
in public squares--

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:05.019
as a protection against the
plague.

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:09.875
And there was a vogue in these
saints' names that parents gave

00:22:09.875 --> 00:22:11.230
their children.
 

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.190
Another way to propitiate--I
said professions.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:20.209
Well, one of the mysterious
movements of the plague years,

00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:25.404
in the early time of the third
pandemic, was a mass movement

00:22:25.404 --> 00:22:27.960
known as the flagellants.
 

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.980
Here the adherents vowed to
devote themselves for a month to

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.789
mass pilgrimage and repentance.
 

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:38.589
They carried the cross.
 

00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:39.838
They prayed.
 

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:43.878
They listened to preachers,
and they underwent public

00:22:43.878 --> 00:22:46.752
whipping and indeed
self-flagellation,

00:22:46.752 --> 00:22:49.548
in order to satisfy God's
anger.

00:22:49.548 --> 00:22:54.288
And when you come to look at
the film by Ingmar Bergman,

00:22:54.288 --> 00:22:57.940
The Seventh Seal,
one of the depictions in that,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.269
one of the scenes that will be
most interesting to you,

00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:08.546
is the capturing on film of
this procession of the

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:10.338
flagellants.
 

00:23:10.338 --> 00:23:14.549
You see them praying and
beating themselves,

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:17.390
and each other,
with whips.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.586
We will see next time too that
this affected the iconography of

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:24.294
European Art,
from the fourteenth century

00:23:24.294 --> 00:23:26.190
through the seventeenth.
 

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:33.113
There is a theme we'll see next
time of the dance of death,

00:23:33.113 --> 00:23:39.080
the so-called danse
macabre, of people being

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.140
rounded up by the grim reaper.
 

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.113
There are also what are called
vanitas symbols,

00:23:47.113 --> 00:23:51.950
which are symbols in art of how
life is very insecure;

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:57.538
that it's brief and can end
very unpredictably.

00:23:57.538 --> 00:24:01.659
Now, these weren't a school of
painting, or an artistic style,

00:24:01.659 --> 00:24:03.548
they were the iconography.
 

00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:06.640
They were themes that painters
depicted.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.977
And it may also be that
portraying the disease in this

00:24:10.977 --> 00:24:15.558
way was a kind of exorcism of
the mysterious scourge,

00:24:15.558 --> 00:24:19.432
and this was a powerful
reminder of the transience of

00:24:19.432 --> 00:24:20.400
all things.
 

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.170
There were also popular
superstitions in these days.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.006
From astrology,
there was the belief that

00:24:28.006 --> 00:24:30.630
certain metals or precious
stones--

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.632
rubies and diamonds--had
protective properties against

00:24:34.632 --> 00:24:38.380
the plague,
as did certain magical numbers.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.095
And it won't surprise you that
one of the great numbers that

00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:44.930
you could conjure with was the
number four.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.257
You know the drill:
four elements,

00:24:48.257 --> 00:24:51.786
four temperaments,
four evangelists,

00:24:51.786 --> 00:24:55.516
four humors,
four winds, four seasons,

00:24:55.516 --> 00:24:57.130
and so on.
 

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.910
So, the number four was very
powerful and protective.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.804
Another aspect of plague,
of course, was that there were

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:08.920
people who profited from it,
profiteering.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.690
The great cities in grip of
plague were lands of

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.900
opportunity, for rogues of every
sort.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.768
The epidemics of disease
brought, in their train,

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.588
outbreaks of crime and
swindling.

00:25:22.588 --> 00:25:26.250
Thieves plundered the homes of
those who had fled--

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.170
remember, those who had fled
were usually the wealthy--

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:36.759
and charlatans peddled every
variety of magical remedies,

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:40.720
while astrologers sold comfort
and advice.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.053
Healers charged astounding sums
for practicing their dangerous

00:25:47.053 --> 00:25:47.779
arts.
 

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:52.269
Those were forms of spontaneous
reaction to plague.

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:56.512
What I'd like to do next is to
talk instead about something

00:25:56.512 --> 00:25:58.780
very different,
that I promised,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.220
which is organized response by
authorities.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.108
And this is the first form of
organized public health,

00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:10.627
that eventually leads,
by the late seventeenth and the

00:26:10.627 --> 00:26:15.141
early eighteenth centuries,
to the first victory of human

00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:18.618
beings over a major infectious
disease.

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:23.700
So, let's look at what those
public health measures were.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.792
Well, empirical observation in
time of plague gave rise not

00:26:28.792 --> 00:26:34.151
only to spontaneous reactions
that we've described but also to

00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:39.858
a new idea that began to spread
alongside medical orthodoxy--

00:26:39.858 --> 00:26:44.288
a new idea, the idea of
contagion.

00:26:44.288 --> 00:26:49.728
That somehow the plague spread
in an unspecified manner from

00:26:49.728 --> 00:26:51.480
person to person.
 

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.520
This idea was largely rejected
for centuries by learned

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.909
official medicine,
which clung to the older idea

00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:04.828
of miasmatism of Galen and his
system.

00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:09.005
But it became an important idea
in popular culture,

00:27:09.005 --> 00:27:13.180
and in the thinking of certain
medical heretics.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.104
It was fully developed by
Fracastoro--whom we've mentioned

00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:22.769
before--of Padua in Italy,
in the sixteenth century;

00:27:22.769 --> 00:27:27.990
but also by the German Jesuit
Kircher in the seventeenth

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.940
century.
 

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.569
The theory was that of a
so-called contagium

00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:37.068
vivum, which consisted of
animalcules of some sort.

00:27:37.068 --> 00:27:42.048
Public policy was--to deal with
plague--

00:27:42.048 --> 00:27:46.269
was first devised in the
northern Italian city-states,

00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:50.058
in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries--

00:27:50.058 --> 00:27:54.970
places like Florence,
Venice, Milan and Genoa--

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.162
and then were adapted
elsewhere, in France and Spain

00:27:58.162 --> 00:27:59.538
and Northern Europe.
 

00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:02.900
What was involved,
as I say, was momentous;

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.460
the world's first system of
public health.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.990
And it turned out to be an
organizational idea of genius.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:15.082
The embryo of the system was
established during the Black

00:28:15.082 --> 00:28:17.607
Death,
and then became increasingly

00:28:17.607 --> 00:28:21.345
sophisticated and comprehensive
through the middle of the

00:28:21.345 --> 00:28:25.548
sixteenth and seventeenth and
then the eighteenth centuries.

00:28:25.548 --> 00:28:30.910
But the Achilles heel,
early on, was that the system

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:35.430
was narrowly municipal or local
in scope.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.808
A quantum leap was made that
turned to make it more effective

00:28:39.808 --> 00:28:43.240
in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.839
when the idea was taken up by
early modern states that devoted

00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:51.460
the military power of the state
to the effort.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.598
You'll note the operation of
magistrates, and their power in

00:28:55.598 --> 00:28:59.950
London, as you're reading Defoe,
in the seventeenth century.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.632
So, the early vision combined,
by this time,

00:29:03.632 --> 00:29:08.941
with the necessary power over a
sufficiently large area to make

00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:10.740
success possible.
 

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.576
Now, an interesting aspect of
the situation is this:

00:29:14.576 --> 00:29:18.988
the authorities took action,
although there was no medical

00:29:18.988 --> 00:29:22.778
understanding of--
or at least nothing that we

00:29:22.778 --> 00:29:28.358
would regard retrospectively as
an efficacious understanding of

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:31.240
the disease they were facing.
 

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.404
They acted more or less in the
dark, and in the process took

00:29:35.404 --> 00:29:39.358
measures that were sometimes
extreme and heavy-handed;

00:29:39.358 --> 00:29:43.950
that often wasted resources and
were sometimes actually

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.650
counterproductive.
 

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.234
But in the end,
the path they pioneered led to

00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:52.980
the first victory over a major
human disease.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.740
So, let's look at the policies.
 

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.430
What were they?
 

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.180
First of all was a new
institution.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.875
Originally, that is,
they were called health

00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:05.078
magistrates.
 

00:30:05.078 --> 00:30:09.700
We now know them as boards of
health.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.861
And these magistrates,
or boards of health as they

00:30:12.861 --> 00:30:15.828
came to be known later and are
still known,

00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:20.009
were endowed with extraordinary
powers during emergencies that

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:22.958
gave them--
they combined in their hands a

00:30:22.958 --> 00:30:26.747
plentitude of legislative,
judicial and executive

00:30:26.747 --> 00:30:31.160
authority in matters that
related to public health.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.959
By the late sixteenth century,
cities in the vanguard of the

00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:38.180
movement even had permanent
health magistrates,

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:42.890
and their example was followed
across Europe.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.098
That was one thing,
a new authority then.

00:30:46.098 --> 00:30:52.400
A second plague measure was
compulsory burial.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.740
And there were so many dead in
a major epidemic that you wanted

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.240
to dispose of them quickly
before they poisoned the

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.034
atmosphere,
and you couldn't bury them

00:31:03.034 --> 00:31:05.740
individually,
and so they were cast into

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.548
common pits,
plague pits.

00:31:08.548 --> 00:31:12.513
And this was followed by the
destruction by fire of their

00:31:12.513 --> 00:31:16.280
personal effects,
and the banning of funerals and

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.634
funeral processions,
a banning of the laying out and

00:31:20.634 --> 00:31:21.500
the wake.
 

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.080
And this problem of burial was
an important issue in every

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.769
outbreak of plague.
 

00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:32.705
Priests and gravediggers were
decimated, and there weren't

00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:37.470
enough people left then to
dispose of the dead in normal

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.250
ways.
 

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:44.460
And it must be remembered that
this generated terror in itself;

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.298
the presence of large numbers
of unburied cadavers,

00:31:48.298 --> 00:31:54.313
in a city where the indignity
of disposal of hurling newly

00:31:54.313 --> 00:32:00.643
dead people into improvised pits
heightened the horror of the

00:32:00.643 --> 00:32:01.910
disease.
 

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:06.595
Another feature of the plague
measures was the control of

00:32:06.595 --> 00:32:09.919
movement--
the control of the movement of

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:13.940
people from plague-infested
regions by quarantine,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:19.617
and squads of soldiers turning
people away from city gates and

00:32:19.617 --> 00:32:24.460
opening fire on those who tried
to cross the line.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.967
Another feature of these times
was the isolation of the

00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:34.759
infected, in pest houses,
known across Europe as

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:36.288
lazarettos.
 

00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:39.890
Or alternatively,
as you know from Defoe,

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.874
people were simply shut up,
together with their families in

00:32:43.874 --> 00:32:48.223
their own homes,
and forbidden to open the door,

00:32:48.223 --> 00:32:54.019
while guards enforced the rule
and were stationed outside.

00:32:54.019 --> 00:32:57.759
Most fearful of all was a
measure called "general

00:32:57.759 --> 00:33:01.345
quarantine",
in which everyone in an

00:33:01.345 --> 00:33:07.397
infected neighborhood was sealed
inside his or her home for forty

00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:11.030
days,
with watchmen outside to arrest

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.618
or even kill those who tried to
escape.

00:33:14.618 --> 00:33:19.471
Let me show you a slide--well,
this is actually not the one I

00:33:19.471 --> 00:33:23.270
had in mind--this is Marseilles
in 1720 to 1722,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.019
during the time of the plague.
 

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.460
And if you looked carefully,
you could see many of the

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.836
events that we've been
describing taking place in the

00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:33.808
foreground.
 

00:33:33.808 --> 00:33:36.924
But instead of that,
I'd rather concentrate on this,

00:33:36.924 --> 00:33:40.529
because this has to do with
your reading in Daniel Defoe.

00:33:40.529 --> 00:33:44.720
This is London in 1656,
that you now know and love.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.954
And you can see here the
bonfires, an attempt to purify

00:33:48.954 --> 00:33:49.740
the air.
 

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.194
You can see these are watchmen
stationed outside to prevent

00:33:54.194 --> 00:33:56.500
people leaving their houses.
 

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.714
And you can see the homes that
are shut up and sealed,

00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:04.612
with people inside,
are marked, that these are the

00:34:04.612 --> 00:34:06.838
homes of plague victims.
 

00:34:06.838 --> 00:34:11.050
So, those were important,
those regulations.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.630
Then there were lazarettos,
the pest houses.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.119
And these shouldn't be confused
with modern hospitals.

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:24.097
They weren't places of cure but
rather barrack-like places of

00:34:24.097 --> 00:34:28.079
horror and death,
where inmates died en masse;

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:32.019
where people were locked up,
not so much to be cured,

00:34:32.019 --> 00:34:36.567
but to spare the city of the
danger of inhaling deadly vapors

00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:39.219
from their contaminated bodies.
 

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:44.300
The pest house was really the
antechamber to eternity.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.304
And the word lazaretto comes
from a biblical reference to

00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:52.880
Lazarus, who was raised from the
dead.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.672
In any case,
let me show you a slide of a

00:34:56.672 --> 00:34:57.809
lazaretto.
 

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:01.963
This is a picture from the
nineteenth century by Gros of

00:35:01.963 --> 00:35:05.739
"Napoleon in the Pest House
of Jaffa."

00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:11.561
And this is a picture by
Tintoretto, of whom we'll see

00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:13.980
much more next time.
 

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.880
This is Saint Rocco--remember I
promised you Saint Rocco,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.690
who stayed behind,
who visited Italy in time of

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.744
plague,
and fell ill himself,

00:35:24.744 --> 00:35:30.360
revived and stayed behind to
tend the dead or dying.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.958
And here we see him in the
lazaretto, which is pretty much

00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:37.380
a place of dread and horror.
 

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.119
And people were conveyed
there--and this was important

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.389
too--by carters.
 

00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:46.389
And the carters also inspired
fear.

00:35:46.389 --> 00:35:51.418
People were forcibly gathered
up and hurled into their

00:35:51.418 --> 00:35:54.360
mournful heaving conveyances.
 

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.050
And these were dreaded almost
as much as the disease itself.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.934
This fear often was due to the
fact that these petty officials

00:36:03.934 --> 00:36:08.420
risked their lives as an
investment through extortion.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.500
Healthy men and women could be
threatened.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.489
The ill could be blackmailed,
so they could be left to die at

00:36:15.489 --> 00:36:17.018
peace in their homes.
 

00:36:17.018 --> 00:36:20.840
Burglars could be sold
information on empty houses.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.670
And often they were drunk,
as they consumed spirits to

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.860
fortify their courage.
 

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.106
Another part of the plague
regulations was the control of

00:36:32.106 --> 00:36:36.592
markets and provisions,
to guarantee the supply of food

00:36:36.592 --> 00:36:40.641
to an afflicted locality,
so that people wouldn't die of

00:36:40.641 --> 00:36:44.400
famine,
as well as disease.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.733
The health magistrates,
or boards of health,

00:36:47.733 --> 00:36:52.539
had also the power to close
brothels and arrest prostitutes.

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:55.786
As I've said,
they often attempted to purify

00:36:55.786 --> 00:37:00.092
the corrupted atmosphere with
bonfires and with sulfur and

00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:01.150
gunpowder.
 

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.047
Well, taken together,
all of these plague measures

00:37:05.047 --> 00:37:09.101
were draconian,
and when first applied they

00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:12.599
probably increased fear and
chaos,

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:16.748
promoted flight by people
desperate not to be locked in a

00:37:16.748 --> 00:37:20.010
dying city or carted away to a
pest house.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.170
And this may have assisted the
spread of plague itself.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.690
Anti-plague regulations were
causes of suffering,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.847
and they often met in various
parts of Europe with fierce

00:37:33.847 --> 00:37:38.449
opposition and caused civil
disturbance and social tensions.

00:37:38.449 --> 00:37:42.900
They involved the infinite
horror of the pest house;

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.719
the separation of family
members;

00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:47.889
the burning of precious
possessions;

00:37:47.889 --> 00:37:50.829
the prohibition of processions
and gatherings;

00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:53.829
the prohibition of movement;
the closing of markets;

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:57.030
the denial of funeral
observances.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.608
So, from Moscow to London,
all across Europe,

00:38:01.608 --> 00:38:07.438
the passage of plague was
marked by demographic disaster,

00:38:07.438 --> 00:38:12.329
by social tensions and economic
disruption.

00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:16.719
Great cities took on the
appearance of ghost towns.

00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:22.489
And these scenes were repeated
for centuries after 1347,

00:38:22.489 --> 00:38:26.920
with outbreaks here and there
every generation,

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.686
and great European-wide
pandemics several times a

00:38:31.686 --> 00:38:32.679
century.
 

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.882
As you know,
the normal pattern was that the

00:38:35.882 --> 00:38:39.309
plague laid waste to a locality
for months,

00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:42.610
and then the disease ebbed and
faded away,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.679
as mysteriously as it began.
 

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:48.849
And this too left a legacy.
 

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:52.190
For the faithful,
the final departure of the

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.920
plague was a sign that God had
been appeased,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.010
and was a testimony to the
wisdom of their repentance,

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:04.914
and perhaps to their decision
to hunt out the guilty in their

00:39:04.914 --> 00:39:05.570
midst.
 

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:11.581
And let me remind you that this
still is marked in the landscape

00:39:11.581 --> 00:39:13.300
of urban Europe.
 

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.070
And I'd like to show you an
example.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.764
And this will be the Castel
Sant'Angelo, right here,

00:39:20.764 --> 00:39:26.289
one of the most common tourist
sites of memory in modern Rome

00:39:26.289 --> 00:39:27.210
today.
 

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.480
That's a general view.
 

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.730
Let's close in a little more
closely.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.664
And here we can see as we're
approaching the Castel

00:39:35.664 --> 00:39:39.992
Sant'Angelo--I want you to
see--I'll have a next picture

00:39:39.992 --> 00:39:42.510
where we'll look at the top.
 

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:46.315
And this then is one of the
major landmarks in a major

00:39:46.315 --> 00:39:47.751
European city today.
 

00:39:47.751 --> 00:39:48.827
And what is it?
 

00:39:48.827 --> 00:39:50.480
It's due to plague.
 

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.746
At the top of the Castel
Sant'Angelo is the archangel

00:39:55.746 --> 00:39:59.789
Gabriel,
and what he's doing is

00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:05.909
sheathing his sword,
as a sign the divine wrath had

00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:11.164
been appeased,
that God had relented and that

00:40:11.164 --> 00:40:17.210
the scourge of the population of
Rome was no more.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.815
For a modern epidemiologist,
the thinking might be quite

00:40:21.815 --> 00:40:24.887
different;
that a vital link in the great

00:40:24.887 --> 00:40:28.335
chain of infection had been
broken, in the chain of

00:40:28.335 --> 00:40:31.356
transmission;
perhaps that the infected

00:40:31.356 --> 00:40:34.809
population of black rats had
been destroyed;

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:38.318
that all of the susceptible
members of the human population

00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:41.860
had already perished;
that the onset of winter and

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.550
cold weather had reduced the
activity of fleas.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.556
In any case,
the point I want to make was

00:40:48.556 --> 00:40:53.070
that eventually the plague
measures and regulations were,

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.360
or at least seemed to be,
effective,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.418
especially after the
seventeenth century with the

00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:05.659
increased military power of an
early modern state that deployed

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:10.902
standing armies and naval forces
to apply the policy rigorously

00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:14.199
and over a substantial
territory.

00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:20.650
Venice provided perhaps the
first important example;

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.623
that was soon imitated in
country after country,

00:41:24.623 --> 00:41:28.427
until Western Europe was
medically isolated by

00:41:28.427 --> 00:41:32.570
quarantines, lazarettos and
sanitary cordons.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.404
Let me talk a little more in
detail about the Venetian idea

00:41:36.404 --> 00:41:37.659
of public health.
 

00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:42.628
It was that--and Venice was a
great port, as you know--that

00:41:42.628 --> 00:41:47.596
the ports of Europe could be
protected by isolation from an

00:41:47.596 --> 00:41:49.309
invasion by sea.
 

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:53.369
To achieve this objective,
the authorities constructed a

00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:56.469
great fortress on the outlying
islands,

00:41:56.469 --> 00:42:00.927
to which all arriving ships
from the Eastern Mediterranean

00:42:00.927 --> 00:42:02.179
were directed.
 

00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:06.690
There they were impounded for
six weeks, while they were

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.739
scrubbed and fumigated.
 

00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:13.923
Crews and passengers were
disembarked at these fortresses

00:42:13.923 --> 00:42:16.980
and quarantined for forty days.
 

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.242
And the cargo and passengers'
effects were unloaded,

00:42:21.242 --> 00:42:24.670
turned in the sun,
fumigated and aired.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:29.005
And only at the end of forty
days were goods shipped and

00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:32.789
passengers released to enter the
city at will.

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:37.003
The theory was that by strict
quarantine any pestilential

00:42:37.003 --> 00:42:40.090
vapors would be given time to
disperse.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.130
And so the city might be spared.
 

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.650
Well, let's look at a couple of
lazarettos.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.670
This is at a port called La
Spezia.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.530
And the point I'm trying to
make is that these were very

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.690
complicated and authoritarian
institutions.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.309
They're fortresses no less.
 

00:42:59.309 --> 00:43:05.139
This is at Naples,
the island of Nisida.

00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:10.657
Or at Marseilles,
this is the great lazaretto on

00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.420
Pharo Island.
 

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.780
This was simple in principle.
 

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.679
It was a maritime quarantine.
 

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:21.699
But to be effective,
it presupposed state power.

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:26.295
A lazaretto was a fortress for
thousands of passengers and

00:43:26.295 --> 00:43:28.284
crew;
had to be policed,

00:43:28.284 --> 00:43:32.880
provisioned and isolated from
all contacts with the city.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.250
It required a strong naval
presence too,

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.891
to compel unwilling and
possibly terrified sea captains

00:43:40.891 --> 00:43:46.451
to anchor within these waters,
and to prevent attempts at

00:43:46.451 --> 00:43:48.440
evasion or escape.
 

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.159
Within the lazaretto,
there were detailed,

00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:54.809
complex regulations to ensure
that hundreds,

00:43:54.809 --> 00:43:58.708
sometimes thousands of
passengers, in different stages

00:43:58.708 --> 00:44:02.268
of quarantine,
would be isolated not only from

00:44:02.268 --> 00:44:04.949
the city but also from each
other,

00:44:04.949 --> 00:44:08.806
and that the items of the
ship's crew would all be

00:44:08.806 --> 00:44:12.268
properly fumigated and exposed
to the sun.

00:44:12.268 --> 00:44:16.777
The idea of quarantine was an
empirical result of long

00:44:16.777 --> 00:44:19.789
experience,
and its establishment,

00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:23.536
to be successful,
presupposed the bureaucratic

00:44:23.536 --> 00:44:27.659
naval and administrative
resources of the early modern

00:44:27.659 --> 00:44:28.360
state.
 

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.280
Well looking back with modern
understanding,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.869
you would probably conclude
that the medical theory

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:38.961
underlying the Venetian system
of quarantine was flawed by

00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:40.469
modern standards.
 

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:44.893
There were no pestilential
miasmas, and many of the rituals

00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:47.639
of purification were to no
effect.

00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:53.315
But the idea of lengthy and
military-enforced isolation was

00:44:53.315 --> 00:44:56.349
highly effective in practice.
 

00:44:56.349 --> 00:45:00.643
Forty days exceeded the
incubation period of the

00:45:00.643 --> 00:45:06.309
disease, and so were sufficient
to guarantee that a person then

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:09.599
released was medically harmless.
 

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:12.949
At the same time,
the period of quarantine was

00:45:12.949 --> 00:45:16.597
long enough to ensure the death
of infected fleas,

00:45:16.597 --> 00:45:18.980
and of the bacterium itself.
 

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.987
So, an inaccurate theory
produced sound administrative

00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:23.969
procedures.
 

00:45:23.969 --> 00:45:28.018
The Venetian lazaretto,
backed by the Venetian fleet,

00:45:28.018 --> 00:45:31.054
demonstrated that it could,
in practice,

00:45:31.054 --> 00:45:33.780
protect the city from disaster.
 

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.931
And within a generation,
other Mediterranean powers

00:45:37.931 --> 00:45:41.585
imitated the experiment,
building lazarettos:

00:45:41.585 --> 00:45:44.492
Naples, Genoa,
Valencia, Marseilles,

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:45.489
Corfu.
 

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:49.510
And all ships from the East
were compelled to dock at them.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:53.949
By the end of the seventeenth
century, the port cities of

00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:57.280
Europe were no longer so menaced
by sea.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.304
The disease continued to be
imported, but was contained with

00:46:01.304 --> 00:46:03.079
just two major failures.
 

00:46:03.079 --> 00:46:08.322
In 1720, bubonic plague spread
from the lazaretto to the city

00:46:08.322 --> 00:46:11.730
of Marseilles,
killing 60,000 people.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.561
And then in 1743,
the last burst of epidemic

00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:21.170
plague in Europe,
at Messina in Sicily.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.980
Meanwhile, there was the
overland threat,

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.590
and this was seen to by the
Hapsburg Empire which,

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:33.280
in the course of the eighteenth
century,

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.862
initiated and perfected a great
permanent cordon

00:46:36.862 --> 00:46:41.266
sanitaire of soldiers,
stretching across the length of

00:46:41.266 --> 00:46:42.920
the Balkan Peninsula.
 

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.422
The Austrian cordon was ten to
twenty miles wide during threat

00:46:48.422 --> 00:46:51.489
of plague, and 1,200 miles long.
 

00:46:51.489 --> 00:46:55.344
It consisted of a great
permanent line of soldiers and

00:46:55.344 --> 00:46:58.253
sentry posts,
stationed to prevent people

00:46:58.253 --> 00:46:59.489
from passing.
 

00:46:59.489 --> 00:47:03.882
So, one of the great armies of
Europe assumed the task of

00:47:03.882 --> 00:47:07.931
isolating Western Europe,
from the east,

00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:15.469
just as the lazarettos and the
ports isolated it by sea.

00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:19.297
Thousands of soldiers,
12,000 during times of

00:47:19.297 --> 00:47:22.690
epidemics, were stationed to do
that.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.539
And it was the case then,
by the eighteenth century,

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:29.300
bubonic plague,
the scourge of five centuries,

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.193
was entirely eliminated,
and didn't return to Western

00:47:34.193 --> 00:47:35.039
Europe.
 

00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:39.302
Let me look at--this is a slide
of a--it could be anywhere,

00:47:39.302 --> 00:47:41.949
it happens to be the city of
Bari.

00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:46.601
And you can see the cordon of
soldiers surrounding the city

00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:49.809
and protecting it from bubonic
plague.

00:47:49.809 --> 00:47:54.226
And it might be said as well
that occasionally the pope

00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:59.380
reinforced the physical sanitary
cordon with a spiritual one;

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.561
that is, threatening anyone who
crossed the line with

00:48:03.561 --> 00:48:05.010
excommunication.
 

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:09.461
Well, this was the world's
first victory in the conquest of

00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:10.230
disease.
 

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:13.769
The greatest epidemic disease
in European history had been

00:48:13.769 --> 00:48:16.981
eliminated,
not by the advance of medicine

00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:21.143
or scientific knowledge,
but by the deployment of the

00:48:21.143 --> 00:48:24.650
military and bureaucratic power
of the state.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:29.172
Or certainly so it seemed,
though we might wonder if other

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:33.059
perhaps imponderable factors
were also at work.

00:48:33.059 --> 00:48:36.619
The replacement of our friend
the black rat,

00:48:36.619 --> 00:48:40.505
who you now know and love,
that was very sociable and

00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:43.420
liked to live close to human
beings,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.364
by the brown rat,
that was shy and retiring and

00:48:47.364 --> 00:48:49.079
kept its distance.
 

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:53.347
Or there were improved
standards of sanitation and

00:48:53.347 --> 00:48:54.219
hygiene.
 

00:48:54.219 --> 00:48:58.440
Or people talked about the
impact--perhaps it was climatic

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.440
change that was decisive.
 

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.559
And people point to the Little
Ice Age,

00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:08.751
which began in the sixteenth
century and reached minima of

00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:13.079
temperatures about 1650,
and again in the 1770s,

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:17.630
and then gave way to warming in
the nineteenth century.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:21.980
And we see this in works of
art, in Dutch painting.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.715
The seventeenth century gave
rise to a great vogue of winter

00:49:25.715 --> 00:49:29.639
scenes that you don't really see
in the modern Netherlands,

00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:33.780
when the canals froze in the
seventeenth century and people

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.849
were able to skate on them.
 

00:49:35.849 --> 00:49:39.427
And there were many other
examples of winter scenes of

00:49:39.427 --> 00:49:40.170
painting.
 

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.300
This was how cold it was in the
seventeenth century.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.070
Indeed, it swept all of Europe.
 

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.530
The River Thames froze in
London.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.110
The Baltic froze,
so that one could travel by

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.469
sled from Poland to Sweden.
 

00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:57.070
And these weren't good
conditions for Yersinia

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.780
pestis, and the fleas that
were its vectors.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.010
But we've run out of time.
 

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.820
But at least we've contained
the plague.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:10.596
And next time we'll look at its
impact on European culture and

00:50:10.596 --> 00:50:11.380
thought.
 

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:17.000

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.792
Prof: So this is the
course on Cervantes' Don

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:08.820
Quixote.
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.589
I am Roberto González
Echevarría,

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.500
from Comparative Literature and
the Spanish Department.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.820
Normally, in Spanish we go by
the first of the two last names,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.620
so even though my e-mail is
Roberto-dot-Echevarría,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.620
I am normally known,
if at all, as González,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.245
Professor González or
Professor González

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.792
Echevarría,
not Professor

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:41.551
Echevarría,
just for your general

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:43.020
information.
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.621
You will be getting tidbits
about Spanish culture such as

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:50.030
the one I've just given you
throughout the course,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.990
even if this is not a culture
class or a language class,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.530
but it is important for you to
know them.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.340
You will also be getting a good
deal about Spanish history,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.608
both in the lectures and in the
assigned readings,

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:11.774
and of course,
through the reading of the

00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:13.129
Quixote.
 

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:16.311
You will also,
of course, have to learn a few

00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.622
titles in Spanish,
works of Spanish literature

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:26.310
that I will be mentioning and
that you will learn in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.947
course of the semester;
but that is to be expected,

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:32.930
I guess.
 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.291
So in this course we are going
to read together one of the

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:41.040
unquestioned masterpieces of
world literature,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.712
let alone the Western Canon,
as defined by my friend Harold

00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:53.843
Bloom in his popular book,
The Western Canon,

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:58.759
where it appears at the very
top of the list,

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.000
paired with Hamlet.
 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.437
The Quixote is a book
that will affect your lives,

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:14.759
not just your understanding and
enjoyment of literature,

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.750
I can anticipate that.
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.938
The Quixote is the first
modern novel.

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:25.508
I'll be talking a lot about the
novel, modern novel,

00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:29.568
and it will become clear as we
move along, because there is

00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:30.550
confusion.
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.901
A novel in which,
according to Gabriel

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:39.389
García Márquez,
the Nobel Prize Columbian

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.375
novelist,
a novel where there is already

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:48.877
everything that novelists would
attempt to do in the future

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.300
until today.
 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.048
Young Sigmund Freud formed the
Cervantes club with his friends,

00:02:55.048 --> 00:02:59.490
and the Quixote was
Jorge Luis Borges' obsession.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.863
Borges, as you may know,
was the great Argentine writer,

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:08.068
famous.
 

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:13.901
Ian Watt, the late British
scholar considered Don

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.931
Quixote "one of four
myths of modern

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:23.620
individualism,"
he called them,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.092
the others being Faust,
Don Juan and Robinson

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:32.456
Crusoe,
in works by Goethe,

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:36.340
Tirso de Molina and Daniel
Defoe,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.090
but this is not the most
important thing about the book.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.479
The Quixote has and has
continued to be read by millions

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:50.128
of readers in every imaginable
language.

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:54.030
And we will be asking
ourselves: Why?

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.025
What is it that this book has
that is so meaningful to so

00:03:59.025 --> 00:03:59.650
many?
 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.294
I myself have answered the
question in this fashion in the

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:09.101
introduction to the Penguin
Classics edition that we will be

00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.043
using in this course,
the Penguin Classics

00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:15.960
translation by John Rutherford.
 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.889
I say there,
in that introduction,

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.658
the following:
"Miguel De Cervantes

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:27.627
Saavedra's masterpiece has
endured because it focuses on

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:32.324
literature's foremost appeal,
to become another,

00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:38.137
to live a typically embattled
self for another closer to one's

00:04:38.137 --> 00:04:40.709
desires and aspirations.
 

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:45.517
This is why Don Quixote
has often been read as a

00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:50.949
children's book and continues to
be read by or to children.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.699
Experience and life's blows
teaches our limits and erode the

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.769
hope of living up to our dreams,
but our hope never vanishes.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:06.009
It is the soul's pith,
the flickering light of being,

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.350
the spiritual counterpart to
our DNA's master code.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.771
When the hero regains his
sanity at the end of Part II,

00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:22.194
he dies as the last chances of
living an imaginary life

00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:25.709
disappear, so must life itself.
 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:30.680
Don Quixote's serene passing
reflects this understanding.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.377
He knows that the dream of life
is over and as a Neo-Platonist

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:42.074
and Christian his only hope now
is to find the true life after

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.569
death."
 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.254
So much for my own quote...
 

00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:49.470
Sorry.
 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.615
For you, reading the
Quixote will be an event

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:59.687
that you will always remember,
and Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:03.475
his squire,
will become life long friends

00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:05.930
about whom you will think often.
 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.029
I can predict that,
safely--I think.

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.339
So, what is the Quixote?
 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.139
A novel, you will say.
 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.247
Well, first of all,
the Quixote,

00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:20.028
if it is a novel,
is two novels.

00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:28.079
One published in 1605 and the
other in 1615.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.620
Together, they are known as
the Quixote --

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.819
much more about the title in a
minute--

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:41.730
and knowledgeable people refer
to them as Part I and Part II,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.060
or the 1605 Quixote and
the 1615 Quixote.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.834
So the first thing to learn--
and I like first things because

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:53.730
I like to build on them from the
ground up--

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:59.377
is that the Quixote
consists of two parts originally

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:04.829
published separately ten years
apart: ten years apart.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:09.346
But what Cervantes wrote,
though, considered the first

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.096
modern novel,
was not a novel as we know them

00:07:13.096 --> 00:07:17.528
today, because novels did not
exist as such yet.

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:22.290
Novels developed in the wake of
the Quixote,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.528
so Cervantes could not have set
out to write a novel.

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:30.208
In his time,
in Cervantes' time,

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:35.478
there were chivalric romances,
stories about knight-errants--a

00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:39.069
lot more about that in the very
near future--

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:46.339
pastoral romances,
stories about fake shepherds,

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:52.098
picaresque lives--what we call
today confusedly picaresque

00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:55.232
novels--
and brief nouvelle or

00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:58.612
novella,
that is, long short stories of

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:01.759
which Cervantes wrote quite a
few,

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:05.463
and very good ones,
and we will read some here in

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:06.930
this course, too.
 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.894
The modern novel would evolve
from translations and imitations

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:16.725
of the Quixote,
particularly in France and

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:20.987
England,
and would attain its current

00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:24.629
form in the eighteenth century.
 

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:29.646
I am very much a historian and
I would like for you to have a

00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:33.739
clear historical,
chronological idea of the

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:39.158
development of the novel and of
Cervantes' own career,

00:08:39.158 --> 00:08:45.076
so take note of these
chronological clarifications

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:47.250
that I give you.
 

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.879
Now, what may you know about
the Quixote?

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:53.424
Many of you,
I suppose, come to this course

00:08:53.424 --> 00:08:56.879
intrigued by the name of an
author and the title of a book

00:08:56.879 --> 00:09:01.265
that you may have heard about,
but that, like most classics,

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:04.628
not many have actually read in
its entirety,

00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:06.269
much less studied.
 

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:10.783
As with most classics,
you have probably heard so much

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:16.149
about the Quixote that it
feels as if you had read it.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:20.982
Many have heard the songs from
Man of La Mancha,

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:25.370
"The Impossible
Dream," and so forth;

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.778
perhaps you have even seen the
show.

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:28.299
It's quite a good show,
by the way.

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:29.928
I don't look down upon it.
 

00:09:29.928 --> 00:09:35.113
It is a version of the
Quixote in an American mode,

00:09:35.113 --> 00:09:39.658
very much an American mode,
but a very good one.

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:43.654
So many of you have seen Man
of La Mancha,

00:09:43.654 --> 00:09:47.899
have heard the songs,
and maybe you have even read a

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:50.730
comic book based on the novel.
 

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.379
There are comic books based on
the novel.

00:09:54.379 --> 00:10:00.330
Others may have read it in a
high school class,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.875
parts of it,
some of you may have read it in

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:08.235
a course like Directed Studies,
in conjunction with other

00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:11.129
western classics,
such as the Odyssey,

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:14.168
the Aeneid and the
Divine Comedy.

00:10:14.168 --> 00:10:18.120
Whatever the case may be,
most of you are probably

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.908
puzzled by the spelling and
pronunciation of the

00:10:21.908 --> 00:10:25.860
protagonist's name and the title
of the book.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.893
Let me clarify those as a
modest beginning,

00:10:28.893 --> 00:10:33.298
the first step having been to
tell you that the Quixote

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.600
is two novels.
 

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.698
Now, the second step is to tell
you about the name of the

00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:43.164
protagonist and how to pronounce
it and how we pronounce it in

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.240
Spanish and how it's spelled,
and why.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.350
The way to pronounce it in
modern Spanish is Quihote,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.759
kee-ho-te.
 

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.549
No gliding to the 'o.'
 

00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:57.690
No 'kee-hoe-te.'
 

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.234
In Spanish we don't glide the
vowels; they are short and

00:11:01.234 --> 00:11:01.750
crisp.
 

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:08.990
Why then, that vexing 'x' in
English?

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.068
The reason is that when the
book was written in the last

00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:14.868
years of the sixteenth century
and the first of the

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:18.461
seventeenth,
the sound of the 'j' in Spanish

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:23.403
was still in the process of
moving from the /sh/ sound that

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:27.240
it had thanks to the influence
of Arabic--

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.596
more about that later--moving
towards the aspirated /h/ of

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:37.105
modern Spanish,
that /sh/ sound was then

00:11:37.105 --> 00:11:43.912
written with an 'x' in the
still-to-be-codified spelling of

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.788
the language.
 

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:50.397
Spelling of modern European
languages was not codified until

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:52.350
the eighteenth century.
 

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.547
For instance,
the modern word for 'soap,' in

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.178
Spanish,
many of you know who know some

00:11:56.178 --> 00:12:00.235
Spanish know it--
;'jabón,' was written

00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:07.070
then with an 'x' and it was
pronounced 'shabón.'

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.535
'México' was pronounced
'Méshico' and was spelled

00:12:12.535 --> 00:12:16.678
with an 'x,' and that 'x' is
still retained,

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:19.360
though in Spanish it is
pronounced 'Mé-hi-co,'

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.009
never "Mé-shi-co.'
 

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:26.477
Hence, the English,
seeing an 'x' in the middle of

00:12:26.477 --> 00:12:32.070
the title of Cervantes' book--
the book was translated very

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.739
early into English:
published in 1605,

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:37.769
the first translation appeared
in 1611;

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:41.850
six years is very fast in the
seventeenth century--

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.126
so the English,
seeing that 'x,' mispronounced

00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:49.570
it 'quic-shote,' with a sound
that it never had in Spanish.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.331
That is why you have the 'x' in
English, and the

00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:57.269
mispronunciation 'quixote.'
 

00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:59.200
You follow the history?
 

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.605
Now, the French,
meanwhile hearing that /sh/

00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:10.062
rendered it 'qui-sho-t' which is
still the way they mispronounce

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:10.778
it.
 

00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:13.899
The French call it 'Don
Quishot.'

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:18.604
I will always say here
'Quijote' and hope that you will

00:13:18.604 --> 00:13:21.740
learn to do the same from now
on,

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.988
at the risk of sounding a
little snobbish to English

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:28.120
speakers.
 

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:35.058
But Yalies can sound snobbish
if you...

00:13:35.058 --> 00:13:40.417
So now a few more basic,
very basic facts about the

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:42.558
title of the book.
 

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:48.033
The little of a book or a
painting is like the first

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:51.360
interpretation by its author.
 

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.379
It is a sort of what we would
call in literary criticism a

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.850
meta-text, a text above the
text.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.220
Sometimes, though,
titles can be misleading,

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.919
but they are always
interesting, and should be

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:10.018
examined carefully making sure
that you gain access to the full

00:14:10.018 --> 00:14:15.398
title of the first edition,
not one that has been tampered

00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:19.519
with by editors or the reading
public later.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:23.107
For instance,
the Pickwick Papers,

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:28.669
the novel by Dickens was really
called The Posthumous Papers

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:34.231
of the Pickwick Club and it
is interesting why it is called

00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:35.038
so.
 

00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:38.389
Now, be careful also with the
translations of titles.

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:42.322
I will tell you later about
some of the Quixotes'

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:46.830
because translations of titles
sometimes are very misleading.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.652
A novel by Alejo Carpentier
called El Siglo de las

00:14:50.652 --> 00:14:54.327
Luces was translated as
The Explosion in the

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.649
Cathedral.
 

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:59.428
So you say, what?
 

00:14:59.428 --> 00:15:01.402
Because the editors thought
that The Age of

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:04.032
Enlightenment would sound
like the title of a textbook or

00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:05.898
something,
so that's the way that they

00:15:05.898 --> 00:15:06.570
translated it.
 

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.249
So you have to be very careful
if you're going to really read

00:15:10.249 --> 00:15:12.580
something carefully about the
title.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.840
So you go to the real title.
 

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.889
Now, the full title of the
first part of Don

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:24.610
Quixote--remember,
published in 1605;

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.683
I want to engrave that date on
your mind--is as follows:

00:15:28.683 --> 00:15:32.759
El ingenioso hidalgo don
Quixote de la Mancha.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:41.482
You know that the 'u' was
rendered as a 'v' before the

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.798
Latin.
 

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:46.850
So El ingenioso hidalgo don
Quixote de la Mancha.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.754
This is a reproduction of the
actual title page of the first

00:15:50.754 --> 00:15:51.879
Quixote.
 

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:55.000
You are seeing it, okay.
 

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:05.261
We are fortunate enough to have
a copy of that first edition at

00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:10.558
Beinecke Library here at Yale.
 

00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:18.769
All right, so let us go over
those words one by one.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.793
I can assure you we are not
going to go over every word in

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:24.820
the book one by one as I'm going
to do with the title,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.268
or it would take the rest of
our lives to finish reading

00:16:28.268 --> 00:16:30.149
the Quixote together!
 

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:38.575
So 'ingenioso' does not
mean here exactly what it means

00:16:38.575 --> 00:16:41.200
today in Spanish.
 

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.739
'Ingenioso' means today
something like 'acute,' 'witty,'

00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:47.570
'cute,' or 'inventive.'
 

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.111
In 1611 Covarrubias
writes--now, Covarrubias is a

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:58.168
name that you're going to be
hearing throughout the semester,

00:16:58.168 --> 00:16:59.298
and I'm going to put it on the
board,

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:02.639
just the last name,
because it's very important.

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:08.220
 
 

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:18.769
His name was Sebastián
de Covarrubias y Orozco.

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:25.484
He was a lexicographer who
published in 1611 the first

00:17:25.484 --> 00:17:30.298
dictionary of the Spanish
language,

00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:33.162
the first dictionary of the
Spanish language called

00:17:33.162 --> 00:17:35.107
Tesoro de la lengua
castellana o

00:17:35.107 --> 00:17:39.673
española,
Thesaurus of the Castilian or

00:17:39.673 --> 00:17:41.618
Spanish Language.
 

00:17:41.618 --> 00:17:45.904
It's very convenient that
Covarrubias published that

00:17:45.904 --> 00:17:50.020
dictionary in 1611,
right in between the two parts

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.472
of the Quixote,
1605,1615; the dictionary comes

00:17:54.472 --> 00:17:55.650
in 1611.
 

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.818
So Covarrubias gives us
Cervantes' Spanish.

00:17:59.818 --> 00:18:05.326
So this is why it is such an
important book for the reading

00:18:05.326 --> 00:18:08.650
of Cervantes' Don
Quixote.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.118
The title itself is
interesting, because it shows

00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:13.950
that Castilian and Spanish are
one in the same thing.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:19.845
I'll talk about that a little
more later--he writes about

00:18:19.845 --> 00:18:23.223
ingenio:
"We commonly call

00:18:23.223 --> 00:18:27.272
ingenio a natural force
of the mind that inquires that

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.579
which through reason and
intelligence can be found

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:33.894
through all sorts of sciences,
disciplines,

00:18:33.894 --> 00:18:38.259
liberal and mechanical arts,
subtle inventions and deceit.

00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:42.654
Hence, we call engineer
(ingeniero) he who builds

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:46.808
machines to fight off the enemy
and to attack him.

00:18:46.808 --> 00:18:53.970
Ingenioso is he who has
a subtle and sharp wit."

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.640
So 'ingenioso' in the
title of Don Quixote,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.410
of the Quixote,
means 'a heightened kind of wit

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.720
or understanding,' one that
verges on madness recalling what

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.769
Plato said in The
Republic about poets,

00:19:12.769 --> 00:19:15.558
poets being slightly bad.
 

00:19:15.558 --> 00:19:18.282
A few years before the
publication of Don

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.690
Quixote, of the
Quixote,

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:25.858
in the year 1575 within
Cervantes' lifetime,

00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:35.915
Juan Huarte de San Juan--you
don't have to remember this name

00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:39.945
so much--
a medical doctor published a

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:44.318
very important book called
Examen de ingenios para las

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:47.598
ciencias,
and so a very long title.

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:55.154
It is 'Wits Examined' would be
the translation of that title in

00:19:55.154 --> 00:20:00.759
which he studies different kinds
of madness.

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:05.836
So Examen de ingenios
meant--of Huarte de San Juan--an

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:10.490
examination of various kinds of
madness of the kind that

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.690
Covarrubias mentioned.
 

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.409
So this is to give you the
context of the word

00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:21.202
'ingenioso' in the title
El ingenioso hidalgo don

00:20:21.202 --> 00:20:23.598
Quixote de la Mancha.
 

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:28.001
Now, 'hidalgo' is a
contraction of 'hijo de

00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:32.660
algo,' which in Spanish
means 'son of something.'

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.160
Of course, we are all sons of
daughters of something.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.164
But what that meant was you are
the son of someone of some

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:44.220
distinction,
of a worthy lineage,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.866
and Covarrubias again,
says it means:

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:52.157
"The same as noble,
with an ancient pure

00:20:52.157 --> 00:20:53.430
lineage."
 

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.410
In other words,
pure of cast,

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.028
of origin, of ilk,
of tradition.

00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:03.500
An hidalgo,
as you will discover reading

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.500
the first chapter of the book is
a petty nobleman,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.318
someone belonging to the lower
nobility or aristocracy.

00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:17.957
It is important here to note
that Cervantes does not call Don

00:21:17.957 --> 00:21:22.278
Quixote here a
'caballero,' a knight.

00:21:22.278 --> 00:21:25.328
The novel is at the most basic
level,

00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:31.440
the story of a petty nobleman
who becomes by din of his own

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.759
self invention a knight worthy
of using the 'Don' that

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:40.500
is given in the title.
 

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.192
In 1615, however,
in the second part of the

00:21:43.192 --> 00:21:46.494
Quixote--
and we will look at that title

00:21:46.494 --> 00:21:50.838
page when we come to it--
Don Quixote is called a

00:21:50.838 --> 00:21:56.929
'caballero' for a variety
of reasons that I will explain

00:21:56.929 --> 00:21:59.088
at the proper time.
 

00:21:59.088 --> 00:22:02.836
Now, 'don,' D-O-N,
is a form of address like

00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:07.108
'sir,' 'sire,' that not everyone
had a right to expect.

00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:09.990
Don Quixote did not,
or Alonso Quixano,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.058
the man who became Don Quixote,
did not,

00:22:12.058 --> 00:22:15.338
by virtue of his modest station
in life,

00:22:15.338 --> 00:22:19.420
but he takes on the
'don' as part of his self

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.380
invention.
 

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.175
'Hidalgos,' in other
words, did not have the right to

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.308
the 'don.' 'Don,'
of course,

00:22:25.308 --> 00:22:30.991
derives from the Latin
'dominus,' 'sir,' 'lord,'

00:22:30.991 --> 00:22:32.150
'master.'
 

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.800
Your readings in Elliot,
Imperial Spain,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.769
one of the books for the
course, will give you much

00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:42.230
further background on this.
 

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.876
Now, 'Quijote' as you
will learn reading the first

00:22:46.876 --> 00:22:51.637
chapters of the book,
too, is said to be a derivation

00:22:51.637 --> 00:22:55.902
of 'quijada,' jaw,
or 'quesada,' something

00:22:55.902 --> 00:23:01.005
having to do with cheese,
or 'quejana' something

00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:04.440
having to do with complaint.
 

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.211
'Quijano' or
'quijana' could be,

00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:10.170
it is said that it is last
name, one of them,

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.039
'Quijano' is the last
name of Alonso Quixano,

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.180
the man of who becomes Don
Quixote,

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.390
the hidalgo who turns himself
into Don Quixote.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.990
These names echo those words
mentioned before,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.068
'quijada,'
'quesada,' and so forth.

00:23:27.068 --> 00:23:31.115
They are not very high sounding
or ennobling words,

00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:35.567
quite the contrary--I hope no
one here has the last name

00:23:35.567 --> 00:23:37.430
Quijano or Quijana.
 

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.430
It happened to me in one of
these classes,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:44.134
as I was explaining this,
that a Hispanic young woman in

00:23:44.134 --> 00:23:47.470
the class had the last name
Quijano,

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.608
and I had to profusely
apologize.

00:23:49.608 --> 00:23:53.003
But I'm just trying to explain
the title of the novel,

00:23:53.003 --> 00:23:56.720
but I am hoping that none of
your last names is Quijano.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.806
Now, the 'â€“ote'
ending, O-T-E,

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:05.670
suffix is a suffix that in
Spanish always refers to

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:11.410
something base or grotesque and
sounds it: 'gordote,'

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:17.122
from 'gordo' is a fatso;
'grandote' from

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:21.730
'grande' is a hulking big
guy, a lummox;

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.818
'feote' from
'feo,' is an ugly cuss,

00:24:26.818 --> 00:24:29.740
so 'Quijote,' then,
was meant to sound abasing and

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.986
ridiculous,
particularly when paired with

00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:38.106
'don,' with which it
forms a kind of oxymoronic pair,

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:40.190
'Don Quijote.'
 

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.461
'Don' is high sounding,
and Quixote has all of these

00:24:44.461 --> 00:24:46.230
negative connotations.
 

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.190
It also has echoes of
'Lanzarote,' one of the

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:54.420
knight-errants that Don Quixote
reads about,

00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:00.339
and it has also been discovered
that it is the name of a part of

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:06.971
the armor covering the leg,
but the important background is

00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:09.430
what I gave before.
 

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.240
Now, 'Mancha,' 'la
Mancha,' is a region in

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.883
central Spain,
in Castile, that encompasses

00:25:14.883 --> 00:25:17.732
parts of the provinces of
Toledo, Ciudad Real,

00:25:17.732 --> 00:25:19.190
Cuenca and Albacete.
 

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.818
There are maps of Spain on the
website and geography is very

00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:30.450
important in the Quixote,
particularly in Part II.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.170
This is a novel that is very
rooted in a given geography.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.548
Now, La Mancha is flat,
arid and monotonous.

00:25:39.548 --> 00:25:42.490
Its main products used to be
cereals and wine,

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.876
but the important thing here is
that it is not,

00:25:45.876 --> 00:25:48.750
or it was not until Cervantes'
work,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:55.660
a particularly desirable place
to be from.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.150
'Mancha' also means
stain in Spanish.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.390
It all sounds like a put down.
 

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:11.700
Being from La Mancha was like
being from Bridgeport,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.730
or Buffalo, or Brooklyn,
or Podunk.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.986
Now, of course,
this has all changed with the

00:26:21.986 --> 00:26:26.243
book,
and now the name has and the

00:26:26.243 --> 00:26:31.701
region has a poetic air,
and there are theme parks in La

00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:34.640
Mancha with windmills and all in
Spain,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.409
of course, but that was not
what Cervantes intended when he

00:26:40.409 --> 00:26:43.990
had Don Quixote be from La
Mancha.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:49.128
It was to be in contrast to
other knights who came from more

00:26:49.128 --> 00:26:53.397
distinguished places,
Amadís de Gaula,

00:26:53.397 --> 00:26:57.848
from Wales, or Palmerín
de Inglaterra,

00:26:57.848 --> 00:27:01.244
from England,
and then, Don Quixote de la

00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:02.009
Mancha.
 

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:04.871
You see, this is what is
supposed to be meant by the

00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:05.318
title.
 

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:08.692
You wouldn't have suspected
this if I hadn't told you,

00:27:08.692 --> 00:27:12.255
because you are still under the
influence of Man of La

00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:13.210
Mancha.
 

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:18.554
Now, the issue of Don Quixote's
spurious 'don' is

00:27:18.554 --> 00:27:22.828
significant in a broader
historical sense.

00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:26.656
By the sixteenth century,
the glory days of the nobility

00:27:26.656 --> 00:27:27.838
were long gone.
 

00:27:27.838 --> 00:27:31.801
Noblemen were no longer much
engaged in the military,

00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:36.450
except that the highest ranks
had never seen actual combat.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.798
Wars were fought by
professional armies.

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:44.326
There was little chance for the
nobility to exercise marshal

00:27:44.326 --> 00:27:49.160
like activities which were left
now to jousts and to hunting.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.848
War became sports for the
aristocracy.

00:27:52.848 --> 00:27:58.093
The nobility was on the whole
on a downturn in Spain because

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:02.269
of policies initiated by the
Catholic Kings,

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:06.128
Ferdinand and Isabella,
to curtail the power of the

00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:07.210
aristocracy.
 

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:11.011
Now, certain groups at the
highest level cluster around the

00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:15.208
courts of the descendants of the
Catholic Kings just had a lot of

00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:17.028
power,
but on the whole,

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:21.054
the nobility is on the decline,
more noticeably so in La

00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:25.631
Mancha, which had a sparse
population of hidalgos as

00:28:25.631 --> 00:28:29.420
opposed to northern regions of
the peninsula.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.288
So for Don Quixote to practice
caballería,

00:28:32.288 --> 00:28:37.338
knight-errantry,
was a way of reviving the past,

00:28:37.338 --> 00:28:41.548
of reliving a past of splendor
and glory,

00:28:41.548 --> 00:28:45.931
now only really available
through reading the chivalric

00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:49.905
romances which portrayed a
medieval world when the

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:53.720
aristocracy was truly involved
in warfare,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.138
or in sports,
such as hunting--of which Don

00:28:57.138 --> 00:29:01.861
Quixote was fond as you will
learn in the early chapters of

00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:02.920
the book.
 

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.205
We will have much more on
chivalric romances as I promised

00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:08.410
in the future.
 

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:12.734
Now, what about the language of
the Quixote,

00:29:12.734 --> 00:29:15.849
what language did Cervantes
write?

00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:18.234
You say: in Spanish;
yes, but we're in the

00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:20.500
sixteenth, seventeenth century.
 

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.481
In the sixteenth century
Spanish was undergoing its last

00:29:25.481 --> 00:29:30.373
significant linguistic
revolution, its last significant

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:31.368
change.
 

00:29:31.368 --> 00:29:35.163
And at the time that the
Quixote was written and

00:29:35.163 --> 00:29:39.027
published, pronoun and verb
forms were still in relative

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:39.660
flux.
 

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.689
But Cervantes' Spanish does not
sound to the modern Spanish ear

00:29:44.689 --> 00:29:48.989
as archaic and arcane as
Shakespearean English does to

00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:51.180
modern English readers.
 

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.838
I have a difficult time
understanding Shakespeare on the

00:29:54.838 --> 00:29:57.700
stage sometimes with my American
English.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.019
It does sound,
the Spanish of Cervantes,

00:30:00.019 --> 00:30:03.344
does sound quaint,
and the book's fame gives

00:30:03.344 --> 00:30:07.518
Cervantes' Spanish today a
formal sound that it did not

00:30:07.518 --> 00:30:11.538
have to its contemporaries for
whom the book was not,

00:30:11.538 --> 00:30:14.088
of course, still a classic.
 

00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:16.957
If read out loud,
the Quixote is more

00:30:16.957 --> 00:30:20.625
comprehensible to current
speakers of Spanish from Spain

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:24.026
and Latin American than
Hamlet is to a modern

00:30:24.026 --> 00:30:26.358
British or American audience.
 

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:30.318
But, what language was it that
Cervantes used?

00:30:30.318 --> 00:30:35.151
Well, he wrote in Castilian or
Spanish, which are the same,

00:30:35.151 --> 00:30:38.150
as we learn in Covarrubias'
title.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:43.210
Americans have the mistaken
notion that they speak Castilian

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:48.269
in Spain, and we don't know in
the rest of Latin America.

00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:53.019
It is the same language.
 

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:56.558
Castilian was the language of
Castile,

00:30:56.558 --> 00:31:00.588
land of castles,
because as the re-conquest--

00:31:00.588 --> 00:31:02.604
you will learn what the
re-conquest is,

00:31:02.604 --> 00:31:05.358
that is, the re-conquest of
Spain from the Moors--

00:31:05.358 --> 00:31:11.009
advanced in central Spain,
as this re-conquest advanced,

00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:14.666
castles were built to secure
the territories,

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.078
hence, Castile.
 

00:31:16.078 --> 00:31:19.868
And then Castile became,
as you will read in Elliot,

00:31:19.868 --> 00:31:24.700
the most influential region,
political and military above

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.068
all of the peninsula,
and with the unification of the

00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:33.221
peninsula under the Catholic
kings it tried to impose its

00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:35.670
language on the rest of Spain.
 

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:43.405
So you know what the difference
between a language and a dialect

00:31:43.405 --> 00:31:44.019
is?
 

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:52.298
A language is a dialect with an
army, so a language is the

00:31:52.298 --> 00:32:00.867
language of a region with enough
power to impose it on other

00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:04.500
people and become so.
 

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.967
So there were--and are--other
languages in Spain:

00:32:09.967 --> 00:32:12.374
Catalan,
Galician, Basque,

00:32:12.374 --> 00:32:16.040
Valencian, but the Catholic
Kings and their descendents

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.776
imposed Castilian on the
peninsula as much as they could

00:32:19.776 --> 00:32:23.240
and on the vast territories of
the New World,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.250
what is today Latin America,
because the discovery and

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.430
conquest were mainly Castilian
projects.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:35.817
Spanish is more uniform as a
result of these policies today

00:32:35.817 --> 00:32:37.490
than English is.
 

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:45.548
So what is spoken in the Bronx,
Mexico City and Madrid?

00:32:45.548 --> 00:32:49.528
Castilian, which is Spanish,
is what's spoken,

00:32:49.528 --> 00:32:52.180
it's spoken in those places.
 

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.628
So you can erase that American
prejudice from your mind if you

00:32:58.628 --> 00:33:00.108
ever had it.
 

00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:03.368
It is true--I mean,
I had a colleague at Cornell,

00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:07.730
a very distinguished American
medievalist who would ask me,

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.880
"In what language do you
write your scholarship,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.848
Roberto?"
 

00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:12.926
I said, "What do you mean?
 

00:33:12.926 --> 00:33:13.970
In English and Spanish."
 

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.730
He was worried that if I didn't
write in English being in Latin

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.957
America,
I didn't have a language of

00:33:18.957 --> 00:33:23.067
culture in which I could write,
because he didn't think that in

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.890
Latin America we had a language
of culture.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.528
It is an American prejudice.
 

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:31.462
Well, if Spanish is undergoing
its last transformation in the

00:33:31.462 --> 00:33:34.743
sixteenth century,
this was also a turbulent

00:33:34.743 --> 00:33:40.483
century for Spain in political,
religious, social and artistic

00:33:40.483 --> 00:33:41.130
terms.
 

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:46.260
Consider that in the sixteenth
century Spain settled the new

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.132
world and beyond,
the Philippines,

00:33:49.132 --> 00:33:54.088
and organized a vast imperial
bureaucracy to rule it.

00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:58.250
Spain also controlled parts of
Italy and the low countries,

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.183
and Spain itself was adjusting
to the unification brought about

00:34:02.183 --> 00:34:05.038
by the marriage of Ferdinand and
Isabella,

00:34:05.038 --> 00:34:08.710
she from Castile,
he from Aragon.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.699
They created the first modern
state--

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:14.735
by the way, you will find in
the Quixote characters

00:34:14.735 --> 00:34:17.780
that come from various regions
of Spain,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.170
most memorably,
at the very beginning,

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.389
a Basque who speaks broken
Spanish because,

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.360
even today, there are regions
in Spain,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.670
as you now if you've been to
Spain,

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:32.460
where Spanish is really not the
language spoken;

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.099
in Galicia, the Basque
countries, and Cataluña,

00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:37.130
and so forth.
 

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.443
Now, in the religious sphere,
Spain became the defender of

00:34:40.443 --> 00:34:43.373
the Catholic Church,
which was breaking up in the

00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:46.050
rest of Europe as a result of
The Reformation.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:50.500
Remember, the Reformation is a
sixteenth century event,

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.940
Spain was the bastion of
orthodox Catholicism,

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.409
and this effected tremendously
its political,

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.289
social and literally life.
 

00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:04.210
In 1492 the Catholic Kings
expelled the Jews from Spain,

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.382
and then, in 1613,
the Moriscos,

00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:09.679
the descendents of the Arabs
who were still,

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:15.659
left, and we will be speaking
about that,

00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:19.985
and there will be distinct
echoes of all of these movements

00:35:19.985 --> 00:35:22.670
and political events in the
novel.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.161
One could say that the
Quixote is not only the

00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:30.489
first modern novel,
but the first political novel

00:35:30.489 --> 00:35:36.583
in that it reflects very clearly
political controversies of its

00:35:36.583 --> 00:35:37.369
time.
 

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:40.574
In the social domain,
there was a significant

00:35:40.574 --> 00:35:43.268
population drain to the New
World,

00:35:43.268 --> 00:35:46.396
social mobility,
caused by the deliberate

00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:51.320
erosion of the aristocracy by a
crown bent on centralization and

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.260
control.
 

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.085
You will find as you read the
book that the characters move

00:35:57.085 --> 00:36:01.996
through areas that are really
depopulated, and this reflects

00:36:01.996 --> 00:36:04.409
this demographic reality.
 

00:36:04.409 --> 00:36:09.351
The new bureaucracy provided
ways to attain wealth and power

00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:13.458
that threatened the status of
the old and powerful

00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:17.652
aristocratic families,
as well as the traditional

00:36:17.652 --> 00:36:22.114
independence of provinces and
fiefdoms that dated back to the

00:36:22.114 --> 00:36:23.230
Middle Ages.
 

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:27.449
In the literary world,
Spain's greatest splendor came

00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:31.224
at this moment,
in the waning of the

00:36:31.224 --> 00:36:38.400
Renaissance and the emergence of
new modern forms and genres.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.125
The sixteenth century opened
actually just before the

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:46.376
sixteenth century,
in 1499, with the publication

00:36:46.376 --> 00:36:50.639
of Celestina or La
Celestina--

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:56.469
that is a word that you should
learn here...

00:36:56.469 --> 00:37:03.030
1499--and was followed by the
emergence of the picaresque in

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.590
El Lazarillo de Tormes.
 

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.172
Lazarillo de Tormes was
the first--what we call--a

00:37:11.172 --> 00:37:13.219
picaresque novel,
1554.

00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:21.929
 
 

00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:28.047
And there emerged what came to
be known as the Spanish

00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:32.780
comedia for the Spanish
theater.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.920
They were not all comedies,
but they were called the

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.336
comedia,
and these were written by Lope

00:37:40.336 --> 00:37:43.474
de Vega--
a name that you might want to

00:37:43.474 --> 00:37:47.474
keep in mind because he was a
very prolific writer who was

00:37:47.474 --> 00:37:49.300
also Cervantes's rival.
 

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.579
 
 

00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:58.329
He may have written seven
hundred plays.

00:37:58.329 --> 00:38:00.802
How many did Shakespeare write?
 

00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:01.840
Thirty-some?
 

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.675
Lope would write those in a
month.

00:38:03.675 --> 00:38:04.510
It's amazing.
 

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:10.235
He was an amazing writer,
very powerful,

00:38:10.235 --> 00:38:18.309
and Cervantes had a very tense
relationship with him.

00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:20.954
In poetry, the sixteenth
century saw Garcilaso de la

00:38:20.954 --> 00:38:23.293
Vega,
a name you will see in the book

00:38:23.293 --> 00:38:25.668
many times,
and his many followers,

00:38:25.668 --> 00:38:29.489
the late great blossoming of
the Petrarchan tradition,

00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:33.393
you know Petrarch,
and the development from that

00:38:33.393 --> 00:38:37.713
Petrarchan tradition of a
powerful strain of mystical

00:38:37.713 --> 00:38:42.135
poetry,
particularly in the verse of

00:38:42.135 --> 00:38:42.501
St.
 

00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:44.949
John of the Cross.
 

00:38:44.949 --> 00:38:48.509
So the sixteenth century and
seventeenth centuries are what

00:38:48.509 --> 00:38:52.130
are called in Spanish literary
history as the Golden Age.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.909
It was also the golden age in
painting.

00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:57.670
If you have been to the Prado
Museum in Madrid,

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.375
you will see what I mean,
and we will be talking a great

00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:04.945
deal about a Spanish painting
here, particularly about

00:39:04.945 --> 00:39:06.360
Velázquez.
 

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.898
Now, our little philological
excursion about the title of the

00:39:10.898 --> 00:39:15.666
book already reveals a number of
things about the Quixote

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:17.179
and about Spain.
 

00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:19.369
You may wonder, Arabic?
 

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:22.730
What do the Arabs have to do
with Spain?

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:26.889
Well, the Arabs occupied Spain
for eight centuries,

00:39:26.889 --> 00:39:29.789
from 711--these are good dates
to remember--

00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:36.085
to 1492, when Granada fell,
and that was last bastion of

00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:39.809
Arab power in Spain,
and it was taken by the

00:39:39.809 --> 00:39:41.659
Catholic Kings Ferdinand and
Isabella.

00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:47.371
But the Arabs left an indelible
mark upon Spanish history and

00:39:47.371 --> 00:39:49.179
Spanish language.
 

00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:53.588
It was not an occupation in the
sense that we envision

00:39:53.588 --> 00:39:56.500
occupations in the modern
period.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.190
Historians speak of a
convivencia,

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:03.074
that is, a living together of
these Christian and Muslim

00:40:03.074 --> 00:40:06.750
cultures which involved fighting
with each other,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.929
but fighting amongst the
Christians,

00:40:08.929 --> 00:40:11.786
and the Muslims allied with
Christians together with

00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:13.130
Muslims, and so forth.
 

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.320
But they were there for eight
centuries,

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.842
and one could say that the
Arabic component in the broader

00:40:19.842 --> 00:40:24.367
sense is the main difference
between Spain and the rest of

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:25.239
Europe.
 

00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:29.059
The title of the book already
alludes to that difference

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:33.090
because of that 'x,' but you
will see it in many other ways

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.409
as you read it.
 

00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:38.670
Now, you can also glean from
what I have said that the

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.931
Quixote was translated very
early into other European

00:40:42.931 --> 00:40:46.764
languages which,
as already mentioned,

00:40:46.764 --> 00:40:52.512
1611 for the English and it
went on to be translated in

00:40:52.512 --> 00:40:54.960
France and so forth.
 

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.710
The Quixote became very
rapidly,

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.840
that first edition in 1605,
a European best seller,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.692
turning Cervantes,
who was, as you will read when

00:41:04.692 --> 00:41:08.018
you read from the assigned
readings in the case book,

00:41:08.018 --> 00:41:13.110
a minor figure,
suddenly into a great success.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:17.387
It never brought him the
financial rewards that he

00:41:17.387 --> 00:41:21.141
desperately needed,
but it turned him into a

00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:22.190
success.
 

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.161
They say that at the beginning
in the early years the

00:41:26.161 --> 00:41:30.349
Quixote was read almost
universally as a funny book.

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:33.608
It's obviously a misreading,
it is much more than just a

00:41:33.608 --> 00:41:34.380
funny book.
 

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:41.081
Now, let us turn now in this
sort of introduction to basics

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:45.702
to the title,
to the protagonists name in

00:41:45.702 --> 00:41:47.090
English.
 

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.365
All of you, no doubt,
have read or heard the word

00:41:50.365 --> 00:41:54.530
'quixotic' and surely have a
general notion of its meaning.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.550
Someone who is a Quixote,
says the Oxford English

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.967
Direction is--quote:
"an enthusiastic visionary

00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:03.570
person like Don Quijote or Don
Quixote,

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.231
[the way that they write it]
inspired by lofty and

00:42:07.231 --> 00:42:11.489
chivalrous but also unrealizable
ideas" --Unquote.

00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:14.389
Hence, 'quixotic' is,
quote:

00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:18.155
"to strive with lofty
enthusiasm for visionary

00:42:18.155 --> 00:42:19.210
ideas."
 

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:25.500
How many authors or books or
characters have entered common

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.670
usage in this way?
 

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:32.222
Actions or people can be
Dantesque, Kafkaesque,

00:42:32.222 --> 00:42:36.378
Rabelaisian,
but are any of these as common

00:42:36.378 --> 00:42:38.159
as 'quixotic'?
 

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:44.132
'Dantesque' always refers to
the Inferno and conveys a

00:42:44.132 --> 00:42:47.217
sense of gloom,
of fire burning,

00:42:47.217 --> 00:42:51.300
sinners and all of that is
Dantesque.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.557
'Kafkaesque' describes the
situation in which a labyrinth

00:42:55.557 --> 00:42:59.739
of forces appears to control
your life and it is applied

00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:01.869
mostly to bureaucracies.
 

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:05.510
Yale's bureaucracy is becoming
Kafkaesque,

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.728
I can assure you of
that--'Rabelaisian,' less

00:43:08.728 --> 00:43:11.952
common,
means uncontrollable appetites,

00:43:11.952 --> 00:43:16.775
most of the time referring to
gluttony: 'He had a Rabelaisian

00:43:16.775 --> 00:43:17.659
dinner.'
 

00:43:17.659 --> 00:43:22.813
But you risk really sounding
snobbish if you say that you had

00:43:22.813 --> 00:43:26.851
a 'Rabelaisian dinner,' even if
you are a Yalie,

00:43:26.851 --> 00:43:31.717
but not saying 'quixotic';
'quixotic' is really part of

00:43:31.717 --> 00:43:33.190
the common usage.
 

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.990
If pressed, I bet any one of
you could give a TV Guide

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:42.610
abstract of the book,
even though who haven't read a

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:43.969
word of it.
 

00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:47.000
It would go something like
this--I made this up:

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.306
"Middle-aged many believes
that he can become a

00:43:49.306 --> 00:43:52.155
knight-errant like those he has
read about in chivalric romances

00:43:52.155 --> 00:43:53.920
and takes to the road with
Sancho,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.280
a peasant, as his squire to set
the world aright,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.989
suffers many defeats but
remains unbowed."

00:43:59.989 --> 00:44:01.699
That's the whole novel,
right there,

00:44:01.699 --> 00:44:04.576
encapsulated,
and you can put that in a TV

00:44:04.576 --> 00:44:09.025
guide or something--
I have the fantasy that you can

00:44:09.025 --> 00:44:13.619
do that with any book no matter
how complicated.

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:17.951
Try it with the Bible or
The Odyssey or something

00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:18.789
like that.
 

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:21.836
But I think with the
Quixote it works,

00:44:21.836 --> 00:44:26.130
and that is what people have in
their imaginations about the

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.239
Quixote.
 

00:44:27.239 --> 00:44:31.889
Now, general knowledge of this
kind is the aura that surrounds

00:44:31.889 --> 00:44:33.110
most classics.
 

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.889
It can become a temptation not
to read them.

00:44:35.889 --> 00:44:38.199
As a result,
this sort of vague knowledge

00:44:38.199 --> 00:44:41.550
also has an undeniable influence
on those who read them.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:45.458
It is nearly impossible to read
a classic innocently,

00:44:45.458 --> 00:44:48.389
unless you are a complete
illiterate.

00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:54.510
Besides, if you have read--in
some ways,

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.387
you have read Don
Quixote if you have read

00:44:56.387 --> 00:44:58.150
The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn,

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:00.170
or if you have read Madame
Bovary,

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.099
or if you have read Kafka's
Metamorphosis,

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:04.659
because of the influence in
the Quixote in all of

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:07.590
those works is so great that in
a sense you have read it through

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.010
them.
 

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.639
Very few literary characters
have this aura.

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:14.711
I wonder, Hamlet,
of course, Faust,

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:19.320
remembering what Ian Watt said,
King Lear, Don Juan,

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.579
Oedipus come to mind.
 

00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:23.789
Can you think of any others?
 

00:45:23.789 --> 00:45:27.980
There are few within each
literary tradition.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.409
For instance,
Huckleberry Finn in the

00:45:31.409 --> 00:45:33.219
American context.
 

00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:35.360
Jean Valjean,
perhaps, in France.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.552
Why is it that Don
Quixote has such currency as

00:45:39.552 --> 00:45:41.610
a kind of literary myth?
 

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.679
I think that there is hardly
another secular book to which we

00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:49.409
come with more preconceived
notions and expectations.

00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:53.034
It is also one of the very few
great works of world literature

00:45:53.034 --> 00:45:56.601
that is also a children's book,
as I said in the paragraph of

00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:57.789
my introduction.
 

00:45:57.789 --> 00:46:00.306
I read it first,
it was read to me,

00:46:00.306 --> 00:46:03.119
as a children's book the first
time.

00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:07.539
Now, is it akin to a modern
secular Bible?

00:46:07.539 --> 00:46:13.059
Miguel de Unamuno,
the Spanish philosopher,

00:46:13.059 --> 00:46:15.735
read Don Quixote as if
it were a kind of secular

00:46:15.735 --> 00:46:18.896
Bible,
and I have the feeling that my

00:46:18.896 --> 00:46:21.659
friend Harold Bloom does the
same;

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:24.947
a kind of new gospel,
a gospel for the modern age.

00:46:24.947 --> 00:46:25.619
Why not?
 

00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:29.487
You have to get something out
of the Quixote relevant

00:46:29.487 --> 00:46:32.632
to your own lives,
I think, or you're going to be

00:46:32.632 --> 00:46:35.190
wasting your time here,
believe me.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.530
I can't tell you what that is,
you'll have to find out for

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:43.719
yourself, but why can't it
suggest something relevant to

00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:44.329
you?
 

00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:49.250
Or, why has it for so many over
so many years?

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:53.043
Now, I gave my explanation in
that first paragraph to my

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:57.045
introduction to the Penguin
Classics, but let me give you a

00:46:57.045 --> 00:46:58.840
more detailed one now.
 

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.505
Whatever other more subtle and
specialized answers we give to

00:47:02.505 --> 00:47:05.010
this question throughout the
semester,

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.186
the only way to respond to it
is to say that Don

00:47:08.186 --> 00:47:11.489
Quixote embodies the most
modern of predicaments:

00:47:11.489 --> 00:47:14.411
the individual's
dissatisfaction with the world

00:47:14.411 --> 00:47:18.442
in which he lives,
and his struggle to make the

00:47:18.442 --> 00:47:20.710
world in his desire mesh.
 

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.936
I mean this world,
not a world yet to come,

00:47:24.936 --> 00:47:26.949
a promised heaven.
 

00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:30.719
Why is this a modern
predicament or crisis?

00:47:30.719 --> 00:47:37.201
Because the world is no longer
a given by the time Cervantes

00:47:37.201 --> 00:47:38.190

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.480
The western conception of the
universe,

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.791
which was up to about sixteenth
century largely based on a

00:47:44.791 --> 00:47:47.639
combination of Aristotle and the
Bible,

00:47:47.639 --> 00:47:50.588
that is to say,
scholasticism and the work of

00:47:50.588 --> 00:47:52.800
Aquinas has been proven faulty.
 

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.150
Think of one major change,
the first part of the

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.106
Quixote is published in 1605
barely over a hundred years

00:48:00.106 --> 00:48:04.065
after the discovery of America,
a hundred a thirteen,

00:48:04.065 --> 00:48:07.081
to be exact,
and the confirmation that the

00:48:07.081 --> 00:48:10.530
world is round,
which proved beyond argument or

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.699
doubt that much of the legacy of
the ancient world in the Middle

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:16.619
Ages was open to question.
 

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:20.648
Think of a second major change,
the Reformation had challenged

00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:24.612
the authority of the Catholic
Church and made political gains

00:48:24.612 --> 00:48:27.190
in many important European
nations.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.630
Don Quixote is not as a
struggle between the individual

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.721
and the gods,
a fight against cosmic abstract

00:48:33.721 --> 00:48:37.492
forces as in Greek tragedy,
it is not as in Dante's human

00:48:37.492 --> 00:48:40.588
desire transformed into the
yearning for a sublime

00:48:40.588 --> 00:48:44.443
transcendental vision cast in a
universe of perfect coherence,

00:48:44.443 --> 00:48:46.340
the machine of the world.
 

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.184
It is, instead,
the struggle of an individual

00:48:49.184 --> 00:48:53.000
against the intractability of a
world in which he lives,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.849
a world redolent with the
imperfections of the material,

00:48:58.849 --> 00:49:04.108
caught in a temporal flow that
carries it further and further

00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:09.280
away from ideals that seem to
exist only in the individual's

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.070
mind.
 

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:12.976
As Hamlet says:
"The world is out of sorts

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:15.440
and I am here to make it
right."

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.230
This is what Don Quixote says.
 

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:21.369
"The novel [says
György Lukács,

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:25.291
the great Hungarian critic]
is the epic of a world that has

00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:27.320
been abandoned by God."
 

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.650
The novels hero's psychology is
demonic.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.989
The objectivity of the novel is
the mature man's knowledge,

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:38.349
that meaning can never quite
penetrate reality,

00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:42.132
but that without meaning
reality would disintegrate into

00:49:42.132 --> 00:49:45.029
the inessential,
into the nothingness of

00:49:45.029 --> 00:49:46.550
inessentiality."
 

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:51.829
This is very abstract language
of Lukács,

00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:55.322
who was a neo-Kantian,
but I think the important thing

00:49:55.322 --> 00:49:59.409
to remember from that is that
it's a world abandoned by God.

00:49:59.409 --> 00:50:03.396
That it is not a God-centered
world any more,

00:50:03.396 --> 00:50:07.112
as in Dante,
that the Quixote moves

00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:08.199
through.
 

00:50:08.199 --> 00:50:12.224
There are other less abstract
definitions of the

00:50:12.224 --> 00:50:16.409
Quixote, global definitions
that I am fond of.

00:50:16.409 --> 00:50:19.530
The one by Larry Nelson that I
quote in my introduction,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.273
too, which goes:
"In crudest terms,

00:50:22.273 --> 00:50:26.757
the formula of Don Quixote may
be expressed as the pairing of a

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:31.313
tall thin idealist with a short
fat realist and setting them off

00:50:31.313 --> 00:50:33.340
on a series of hazards.
 

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.050
In previous fiction,
pairs of characters had almost

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:39.869
always been young friends or
lovers.

00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:43.358
This new, however,
simpler arrangement together

00:50:43.358 --> 00:50:48.059
with the motif of bad literature
influencing life constitutes a

00:50:48.059 --> 00:50:52.079
primal and influential glory for
Cervantes."

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:56.239
A corollary issue to the
question of the individual's

00:50:56.239 --> 00:51:01.280
maladjustment to the world is
another crucial modern concern;

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.759
the perception of reality and
the organization of that

00:51:04.759 --> 00:51:08.829
perception into something that
can be considered the truth,

00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:12.161
the way that modern criticism
has labeled this in the

00:51:12.161 --> 00:51:14.039
Quixote is perspectivism.
 

00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:17.503
The interpretation of reality
depends on the perspective of

00:51:17.503 --> 00:51:20.362
the individual,
meaning in gross terms that

00:51:20.362 --> 00:51:23.795
one's interpretation of the
world is colored by one's

00:51:23.795 --> 00:51:26.369
background station in life
reading,

00:51:26.369 --> 00:51:28.329
desires, and experience in
general.

00:51:28.329 --> 00:51:32.117
There is a hilarious series of
episodes when Don Quixote takes

00:51:32.117 --> 00:51:35.264
a basin from a barber,
puts it on his head and says

00:51:35.264 --> 00:51:38.885
that it is Mambrino's helmet,
a famous helmet from the epic

00:51:38.885 --> 00:51:39.590
tradition.
 

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.809
And in one of the episodes at
the inn,

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:49.469
there ensues a scholastic like
discussion about whether this

00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:54.702
thing is a basin or a helmet,
which is, of course,

00:51:54.702 --> 00:52:00.329
a funny reenactment of the
issue of perspectivism,

00:52:00.329 --> 00:52:04.376
what for Don Quixote is a
helmet, to others it's a

00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:05.780
barber's basin.
 

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:10.003
This is at the core of the
book, at the core of much of the

00:52:10.003 --> 00:52:12.715
humor in the book;
this idea of the various

00:52:12.715 --> 00:52:13.449
perspectives.
 

00:52:13.449 --> 00:52:18.438
Don Quixote sees giants and
Sancho sees windmills,

00:52:18.438 --> 00:52:23.630
and the clash repeats itself
throughout the book.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.119
But this points to a very
important issue at the

00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:32.489
beginnings of modern philosophy,
having to do precisely with the

00:52:32.489 --> 00:52:36.329
perspective of the individual on
reality,

00:52:36.329 --> 00:52:42.981
and not a perspective that has
to be determined by received

00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:43.900
ideas.
 

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:48.394
So these are some of the issues
that will come up during the

00:52:48.394 --> 00:52:51.518
semester as we read the
Quixote.

00:52:51.518 --> 00:52:59.090
Please do the reading as I have
set it out in the syllabus.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:00.501
The syllabus,
as you know,

00:53:00.501 --> 00:53:01.630
is on the website.
 

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:08.184
You can download it from the
website, and there you will find

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:11.679
all of the readings in detail.
 

00:53:11.679 --> 00:53:16.539
I want to go over very briefly
over that syllabus,

00:53:16.539 --> 00:53:22.516
although you don't have it,
and also want to have you meet

00:53:22.516 --> 00:53:28.597
with the two TAs so you can
begin to try to set up meetings

00:53:28.597 --> 00:53:30.800
for the sections.
 

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.302
Now, let me go over the
requirements for the course,

00:53:34.302 --> 00:53:38.353
too, because I am sure that you
are eager to learn what your

00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:40.070
requirements will be.
 

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:45.460
 
 

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:51.500
Now, a mid term and a take home
final exam;

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.679
four two-page papers.
 

00:53:54.679 --> 00:53:57.190
For years I have been using
this technique.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.532
Four papers,
but each paper is only two

00:54:00.532 --> 00:54:04.050
pages, 500 words,
no more and no less.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:08.047
Two pages, because I want
something crisp and to the

00:54:08.047 --> 00:54:09.380
point: an idea.
 

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.253
I will give you the topics of
the paper for which you can

00:54:13.253 --> 00:54:17.610
devise your own particular topic
but so you don't have to begin:

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.835
'the Quixote,
the novel written by Miguel de

00:54:20.835 --> 00:54:22.880
Cervantes...' No,
you're writing for me.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:29.021
I'm giving you what I hope to
be a sharp, original take on the

00:54:29.021 --> 00:54:33.250
topic that I give you,
so four of those.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.518
And then, you are required to
come to class.

00:54:36.518 --> 00:54:40.534
We will have discussion after
my lectures in the last fifteen

00:54:40.534 --> 00:54:45.847
minutes of the class,
and you are required to come to

00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:51.083
the sections as well,
where you will be graded on

00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:54.119
your performance in the section.
 

00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:56.554
The grade distribution,
you will find it in the

00:54:56.554 --> 00:54:59.150
syllabus, it's forty percent the
short papers,

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.530
twenty percent the midterm and
twenty-five final exam,

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.280
fifteen attendance,
and so forth.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.500
You can get it and it is rather
conventional.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.820
Do you have any questions?
 

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.679
Yes.
 

00:55:10.679 --> 00:55:11.949
Student:  Where are the
books available?

00:55:11.949 --> 00:55:15.255
Prof: The books are
available at Barnes and Noble

00:55:15.255 --> 00:55:17.480
and under the number of the
course.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.123
And the books are three:
the Quixote in

00:55:22.123 --> 00:55:26.869
translation, the Imperial
Spain, and the

00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:32.340
Casebook that I edited
with the criticism.

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.317
Now, there is also available a
Spanish edition of the

00:55:36.317 --> 00:55:40.150
Quixote if you are going to
read it in Spanish.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:43.885
It's the same one that is
available for Spanish 660,

00:55:43.885 --> 00:55:46.230
that is, the graduate seminar.
 

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.268
You can buy both if you want to
play around with them.

00:55:49.268 --> 00:55:52.068
I have to say that I am not
entirely happy with

00:55:52.068 --> 00:55:55.172
Mr. Rutherford's translation
even though I wrote the

00:55:55.172 --> 00:55:56.329
introduction.
 

00:55:56.329 --> 00:56:01.670
I'm not happy with any of the
translations.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.822
There really isn't a
translation as good as

00:56:04.822 --> 00:56:09.250
Smollett's, from the eighteenth
century, and Rutherford,

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:13.143
what I wrote in the
introduction--and I had a bitter

00:56:13.143 --> 00:56:16.880
exchange through the publisher,
because I wanted him to change

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.681
a few things,
but he's an Oxford professor

00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:23.510
who's very antiquated and he
didn't change it--

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:30.447
But I will be pointing out the
shortcomings of his translation

00:56:30.447 --> 00:56:32.610
as we move along.
 

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.018
But I mean, that's what we have
to deal with,

00:56:35.018 --> 00:56:37.230
because if you're going to read
it in translation,

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:40.947
the translation by Edith
Grossman that has also

00:56:40.947 --> 00:56:44.099
circulating a lot,
Edie is my friend.

00:56:44.099 --> 00:56:47.690
It's a little better perhaps,
but I like this one because it

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.230
has my introduction,
which I think is better than

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.472
Harold Bloom's for Edie's
translation-- Harold is a very

00:56:52.472 --> 00:56:55.552
dear friend of mine--
so this is why I chose,

00:56:55.552 --> 00:56:59.760
again, to go with the
Rutherford translation.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.519
So, any other questions?
 

00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:03.039
The books are there.
 

00:57:03.039 --> 00:57:06.657
The website has all of the
information you could possibly

00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:07.110
want.
 

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:10.639
My office hours are on Fridays,
from ten to twelve.

00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:17.878
I am not particularly fond of
e-mails because I don't want you

00:57:17.878 --> 00:57:19.657
to,
up at two in the morning,

00:57:19.657 --> 00:57:22.304
say: I have to e-mail Professor
Gonzalez about this idea that I

00:57:22.304 --> 00:57:23.159
have for a paper.
 

00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:25.672
Don't expect that I'm going to
answer the next day,

00:57:25.672 --> 00:57:27.329
because I get a lot of e-mails.
 

00:57:27.329 --> 00:57:34.989
And so I am much more fond of a
personal meeting.

00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:39.905
You come to my office,
and we talk about this,

00:57:39.905 --> 00:57:40.670
okay.
 

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.829
Any other questions?
 

00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:47.572
Well, if not,
we are going to now pause so

00:57:47.572 --> 00:57:52.501
that you meet with Elena and
Dina who are distinguished

00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:54.561
students,
Elena in Spanish and

00:57:54.561 --> 00:57:56.440
Portuguese, and Dina in
Comparative Literature.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.934
Elena, as I said,
is from Alicante,

00:58:00.934 --> 00:58:02.389
in Spain.
 

00:58:02.389 --> 00:58:05.909
Dina is from Russia.
 

00:58:05.909 --> 00:58:07.530
Are you from Moscow itself?
 

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:15.070
No, no, you are from somewhere
in the backlands of Russia.

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:16.610
Siberia, perhaps?
 

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.590
Student:  Almost, almost.
 

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:22.697
Prof: So could you meet
with them now,

00:58:22.697 --> 00:58:26.340
and try to begin to set up a
meeting?

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.855
Because I know it's very
complicated so I'm giving you

00:58:28.855 --> 00:58:29.329
some time.
 

00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.710
Okay.
 

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:35.000

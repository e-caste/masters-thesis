00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.429
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, we're going to continue

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.210
talking about tissue engineering
today.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.227
I introduced the subject on
Tuesday and I'm going to talk

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:25.245
about some more examples that
sort of illustrate this new

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.330
approach to creating medical
therapies.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.192
I just wanted to remind you
before about the two readings

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:38.488
that are already posted on the
website and to encourage you to

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:44.045
look at those to get a sense for
how the field has developed over

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:49.105
the last 20 years or so.
Last time I used this sort

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:53.114
of outline as a guide of,
at least, my view of the

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.470
characteristics of tissue
engineering.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.689
We talked about it at the
beginning of class last time,

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:02.908
there's a logical extension of
conventional medical and

00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:06.397
surgical practices.
In that sense a solution,

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:11.393
potentially a solution to the
limited number of donor organs

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:16.220
that are available to treat
diseases where transplantation

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.899
of tissue is the only option.
Many approaches to tissue

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.290
engineering involve regulating
your body's natural response.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.868
We can heal,
in many cases,

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:30.814
and regenerate.
The liver is a--for example

00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:34.200
is a fabulously regenerative
organ.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.864
If you go into a laboratory
animal, like a rat,

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:41.209
if you remove two-thirds of
their liver,

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.069
their liver will re-grow within
a period of a couple of weeks.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.550
The liver has an amazing
regenerative capacity.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.758
There are human diseases where
that regenerative capacity is

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:55.217
overwhelmed.
Infection can be that kind of a

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:58.959
disease, hepatitis infection,
for example;

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.840
cirrhosis is that kind of
infection.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.717
When you get past the body's
natural ability to heal itself,

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:10.189
then transplantation is the
only option.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.784
In tissue engineering,
we might be thinking about a

00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:17.235
different strategy,
could we provide some support

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:20.039
for the body's own ability to
heal?

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.128
Could you provide a little bit
of extra liver tissue that would

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:29.970
allow the body an opportunity to
compensate for its loss?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.531
Tissue engineering involves
control or regulation of the

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.582
normal healing process.
Today I'm going to start by

00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:39.840
talking about how it attempts to
replace or supplement the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.240
cellular component of diseased
tissues.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.558
When a tissue is diseased,
for example,

00:02:46.558 --> 00:02:52.809
when we talked about the
coronary arteries and needing a

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.828
bypass,
you're adding extra cells or

00:02:55.828 --> 00:02:58.606
extra tissue there because
medical therapies,

00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:02.466
at least the ones we have now,
are not effective at

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:06.020
re-establishing the blood flow
pathway.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.452
You're adding new cells and
they have to be cells that are

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:13.102
in the correct configuration.
They have to be cells like a

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:16.667
vessel, and they have to be
performing the functions that

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:20.297
cells ordinarily provide.
I talked about how we couldn't

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:23.684
use completely synthetic
materials to replace that blood

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:25.800
vessel,
even though a synthetic

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.669
material would provide a conduit
for blood.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.036
Because the material properties
aren't right,

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:35.632
it isn't the same as the
natural cellular layer,

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.770
then blood coagulates on the
surface.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.400
It doesn't provide that normal
function that cells provide.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.840
We want to think about ways to
replace or supplement that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.784
cellular component.
Let me talk about one

00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:53.989
example.
This is an example that I've

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.835
been working on in my own lab,
together with two different

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.400
laboratories at the medical
school,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.159
Jordan Pober in Immunology and
Al Bothwell in Immunology.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.604
It really uses a strategy
that's been used in laboratories

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:14.360
around the world to try to
re-establish tissues in animals.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.804
The technique is fairly
straightforward and shown in

00:04:18.804 --> 00:04:22.290
this cartoon,
that cells are cultured.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.759
These are special cells in a
couple of different ways.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.716
One is they are human cells,
and they are harvested from

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:35.388
human umbilical veins.
The umbilical vein,

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:38.721
which is normally discarded
after delivery,

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:42.134
the baby is born,
the umbilical cord and the

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:45.230
placenta are ordinarily
discarded.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.823
If you keep that tissue,
you can isolate the cells that

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:54.306
form the lining of that tissue.
It's a vein and what you get

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:56.879
from this isolation are
endothelial cells.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.819
It's abbreviated here HUVEC,
that stands for 'human

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.232
umbilical vein endothelial
cells.'People have learned

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:10.670
over the past few decades how to
maintain these cells in culture,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.724
how to propagate them,
how to increase them in number

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.895
using the same techniques we
talked about very near the

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.645
beginning of the course.
They've also discovered how to

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.857
genetically modify these cells
so that they perform better in

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.279
culture.
One of these modifications is

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.269
to add a gene called
Bcl-2.

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:33.890
Bcl-2 is a survival gene
that allows these cells to live

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.170
beyond when you would expect
them to live.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.578
If you just take human
umbilical vein,

00:05:39.578 --> 00:05:42.442
endothelial cells,
and you propagate them and

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.766
culture you can passage them.
Remember the process of

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:48.016
passaging from one tissue
culture to another,

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:49.959
always getting more and more
cells.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.077
You can do that for some
limited period of time,

00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:53.970
but if you give them this
survival gene,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.668
Bcl-2, you can do that for a
much longer period of time,

00:05:57.668 --> 00:06:03.626
you can get more cells.
Cells are grown from human

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:07.180
tissues.
The idea is to somehow get

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.108
these cells into an animal,
or into a patient,

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:16.259
and get them to reform blood
vessels inside the patient.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.459
The way that this is done is
that these cells are suspended

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:25.960
in a three-dimensional gel.
This is a gel of collagen and

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.500
it looks just like this scanning
electron micrograph.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.979
On the side,
if you looked at very high

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.915
magnification,
it's just a web or a network of

00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:38.829
protein fibers formed from the
natural protein collagen.

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:42.301
We talked about collagen's role
in the extracellular matrix

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.039
earlier.
Here, this is isolated

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.512
collagen, purified,
and then formed into a gel,

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:53.110
and cells are suspended within
it.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.780
That's what this picture down
here is to show you.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.915
This is a high magnification;
a cell in here would be almost

00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:04.500
the same size as this full
picture would be a cell,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.833
and so you can imagine each
cell that's suspended in this

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:13.089
three-dimensional material is
surrounded by a webbing of

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:16.920
protein fibers.
It has a thickness;

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.594
so unlike normal cell culture
where we grow them flat on a

00:07:20.594 --> 00:07:23.043
plastic dish,
these cells are suspended

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:27.483
within a three-dimensional gel.
Now there's something else

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:30.321
in this gel here,
and that's shown here,

00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:33.961
these are particles,
particles made of the material

00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:37.310
alginate.
In section a few weeks ago you

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.768
all made particles like this.
We made them with food coloring

00:07:41.768 --> 00:07:44.995
in them, but you learned the
process, it's quite

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:48.700
straightforward.
Imagine that instead of putting

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.959
food coloring in it like we did,
you put in a protein.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:57.394
You selected that protein to be
one that encourages blood

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:00.973
vessels to form.
It's a protein that your body

00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:05.430
naturally uses to cause blood
vessels to form more readily.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.139
That protein is called vascular
endothelial growth factor,

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.688
or VEGF.
It's not important the details

00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:15.740
but it's a signal that the body
uses to form new blood vessels.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.062
We've isolated it,
purified it,

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:21.391
and encapsulated it in these
tiny particles,

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:25.649
which are then suspended with
the cells in the gel.

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:28.806
What you have here is
something that you might call a

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:31.963
neo-tissue, what we would like
to become a tissue when we

00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:35.347
implant it back in the animal.
It's not a tissue yet,

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:38.748
it's a collection of cells and
extracellular matrix,

00:08:38.748 --> 00:08:41.749
and signaling molecules that
are arranged in a

00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:45.504
three-dimensional structure.
The hope is that if you put

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:48.899
these back into a patient or put
them back into an animal,

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:53.934
like the mouse shown here,
that you would grow new blood

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:56.440
vessels.
That's the hope.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.584
How does this work?
This is some early work

00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:03.193
that was done by Jordan Pober
here in the School of Medicine,

00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:05.480
and there's a lot of pictures
here.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.906
This is from a paper that I
could give you if you're

00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:10.760
interested in reading in more
detail, but I want you to focus

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.534
on this one here.
What they did was they--instead

00:09:13.534 --> 00:09:16.683
of taking this gel and putting
it right into the animal,

00:09:16.683 --> 00:09:19.259
they maintained it in culture
for a while.

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:23.924
The idea was that in culture
you can control the conditions

00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:26.980
that the neo-tissue develops
within.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.237
Maybe you can control them in
such a way that the tissue gets

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.059
a start toward being what you
would like it to be.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:35.929
In this green picture here,
I don't know if you can see it.

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:39.330
It's posted online and you
could blow it up and take a look

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.911
at it.
What you see is that these

00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:45.809
cells have organized into
tube-like structures.

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:49.349
You'll see tubes clearly here
in this gel where you don't see

00:09:49.349 --> 00:09:52.240
them so clearly in the other
green images here.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.874
These are the cells I
talked about before,

00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:58.095
the ones that are genetically
modified with the survival

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:00.730
protein, so that they survive in
culture.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.285
It turns out this survival
protein also encourages their

00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:07.840
formation into tube-like
structures that are starting to

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.514
look like blood vessels.
If you wait the proper period

00:10:11.514 --> 00:10:14.730
of time and then implant these
gels into a mouse,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.953
so here they just made a small
incision in the skin and slipped

00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:20.450
the gel underneath the skin and
left it there,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.830
then these tubes developed into
blood vessels.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.514
Now that would be cool enough
on its own, but it does

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:31.490
something more,
in that this gel that's now

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.750
filled with blood vessels does
two things.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.348
One is that the vessels start
to differentiate,

00:10:37.348 --> 00:10:41.019
some become like capillaries,
some become like veins,

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:45.525
some become like arteries,
and they start to connect to

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:48.529
the vascular system of the
mouse.

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:51.891
If you wait long enough and
you look by electron microscopy

00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:53.898
inside these gels,
you will find many,

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:56.230
many blood vessels that look
like this.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.149
This is a cross-section in this
Panel B below.

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:02.142
You can see the endothelial
cells have formed into a

00:11:02.142 --> 00:11:05.244
capillary, it's a tube.
Not only is it a tube but

00:11:05.244 --> 00:11:07.860
here's a mouse blood cell inside
of it.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.179
It's a tube that's now carrying
mouse blood through it.

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:17.029
You've created new pathways for
blood to flow.

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:22.602
Now that's a neat trick and you
could imagine using that to

00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:26.152
treat disease.
One way you might use it to

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.853
treat disease is to implant
these things into areas of the

00:11:29.853 --> 00:11:33.360
body that--where there aren't
enough blood vessels.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.563
For example,
many adults get vascular

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:46.509
deficiencies in their legs.
These could result from trauma,

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:49.340
some from just the natural
process of aging,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.886
some from diseases like
Diabetes and the blood vessels

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:55.593
in your legs don't work anymore.
If you're not delivering enough

00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:59.541
blood to your leg the tissues
become ischemic or deprived of

00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:01.773
oxygen.
What if you put one of these

00:12:01.773 --> 00:12:05.123
patches into that area where you
weren't getting enough blood

00:12:05.123 --> 00:12:07.580
flow and you could create new
blood flow.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.549
That's what this experiment
shows here, treating an ischemic

00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:15.399
limb with one of these patches.
What you see particularly in

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:18.892
high magnification is that lots
and lots of new blood vessels

00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:22.094
form and they connect back to
the major vessels that are

00:12:22.094 --> 00:12:25.304
already in the legs.
You've created new blood flow

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:27.200
pathways.
One could imagine using

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.634
this in the heart,
for example,

00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:31.326
as well.
When you have tissue that's

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:34.857
deprived of oxygen because of a
heart attack,

00:12:34.857 --> 00:12:37.104
for example,
or loss of flow,

00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:40.526
that's one idea;
another idea is that you could

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:43.190
use these to create sort of
miniature organs.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.223
What if instead of just putting
endothelial cells in there we

00:12:48.223 --> 00:12:51.159
put other cells in there as
well.

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:54.507
What if you put liver cells in
together with the endothelial

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.549
cells and the signaling
molecules?

00:12:56.549 --> 00:12:59.190
What if you put cells from the
pancreas in there?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.303
Then maybe this gel would
develop not only into a

00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:05.547
vascularized tissue,
but into a vascularized tissue

00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:09.310
that contained liver cells or
cells from the pancreas,

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.736
or cells from the kidney.
Maybe those cells would start

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:16.779
to function like a little
tissue.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:21.127
Maybe you could make a system
that supports the liver,

00:13:21.127 --> 00:13:24.899
in the case the natural liver
is developing.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:31.360
This is one of the central
ideas of tissue engineering.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.518
One of the other--that I
think illustrates one of the

00:13:36.518 --> 00:13:42.138
reasons why tissue engineering
has become a viable alternative

00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:47.757
at this point in the scientific
culture because we know how to

00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:51.052
culture cells,
we know how to genetically

00:13:51.052 --> 00:13:53.678
manipulate cells,
and we know how to put them in

00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:56.025
these kinds of
micro-environments like I've

00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:58.008
shown.
The other thing that we've

00:13:58.008 --> 00:14:00.850
learned how to do is--and I
mentioned this last time,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.282
is to make synthetic materials
that could serve as artificial

00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:09.663
extracellular matrices.
This slide shows a number of

00:14:09.663 --> 00:14:14.639
materials that were made in
laboratories here at Yale.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.029
One of them is a network of
fibers;

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:21.319
now this should look
reminiscent to the collagen

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.970
picture I showed you a few
slides ago.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.178
It looks like a network of
fibers that are all wound

00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:30.274
together.
Now the fibers here are much

00:14:30.274 --> 00:14:33.435
bigger then collagen fibers.
In fact, a cell here would look

00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:36.000
very tiny on this scanning
electron micrograph,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.313
where it filled up the whole
thing before,

00:14:38.313 --> 00:14:41.360
so we're thinking about fibers
at a different scale.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.444
These are large fibers.
In fact, these are the same

00:14:44.444 --> 00:14:48.009
kinds of fibers that are used,
same size and in some cases,

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:52.352
the same actual fibers that are
used to make the materials in

00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:55.941
your clothing.
Clothing is made of fibers that

00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:59.046
are woven together.
This is a non-woven mesh,

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:02.609
so the fibers are randomly
arranged, but they're fibers not

00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:06.173
unlike the kinds of fibers you
would find in cloth material

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:09.812
that we make into clothing.
At high magnification these

00:15:09.812 --> 00:15:12.347
are cylindrical fibers,
there's lots of space in

00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:15.467
between them,
and so you could fill these

00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:20.401
fibers up with cells and cells
would cling to the fibers and

00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:23.830
potentially grow within this
scaffold.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.502
This is a different kind of
architecture of a scaffold but

00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:31.110
made of the same sort of
material, synthetic polymers.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.072
Here instead of making fibers,
a porous structure was made

00:15:35.072 --> 00:15:38.483
that looks like a sponge.
There are the walls of the

00:15:38.483 --> 00:15:42.199
material that give it substance,
and there are lots of spaces in

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:45.561
between much larger then cells
that you could fill up with

00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:48.815
cells.
Why use synthetic materials

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:53.689
when I already showed you an
example of how you could use a

00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:56.156
natural material?
Well there's a couple of

00:15:56.156 --> 00:15:58.772
advantages.
One is that we know a lot about

00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:01.639
how to process synthetic
materials now.

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:05.110
We can make them into almost
anything that you want.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.549
You can control their structure
on the microscopic scale,

00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:11.750
as I've shown here.
You can control their structure

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.202
on the larger scale as well,
which I'll show you in a few

00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:17.848
minutes.
The other advantage is that

00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:21.784
these particular--these are
different than the kinds of

00:16:21.784 --> 00:16:25.283
fibers that are woven into
clothing because these

00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:29.423
intentionally degrade over time.
These are synthetic

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:32.562
polymers that will slowly
dissolve over a period of

00:16:32.562 --> 00:16:35.012
months.
One could make a scaffold,

00:16:35.012 --> 00:16:38.375
build a tissue around it,
implant it in the body,

00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:42.019
and then this scaffolding would
slowly disappear.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:46.516
What you hope is that as
the--during the time period when

00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:51.494
this scaffolding is disappearing
genuine tissue is being formed

00:16:51.494 --> 00:16:55.587
in its place.
That's an advantage of these

00:16:55.587 --> 00:17:00.166
materials as well,
that because they're polymers

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:03.409
we can control,
to a fairly high degree,

00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:07.070
how fast they degrade and what
products they degrade into.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.694
This shows you an example
of tissue engineering where

00:17:14.694 --> 00:17:17.995
these kinds of materials,
I showed you on the last slide,

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.878
so microscopically they'd look
like this up on the top panel

00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:22.592
here.
Macroscopically,

00:17:22.592 --> 00:17:26.478
or with your eye,
this is just a photograph from

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:29.500
a camera.
Y ou could make these thick

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.884
materials, full of all this
webbing of fibers,

00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:36.569
and you could form them into
different shapes,

00:17:36.569 --> 00:17:40.630
a triangle, a square,
or a cross in this shape here.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.699
Now because this is a synthetic
solid material,

00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:47.369
it maintains its shape even if
you put it into water.

00:17:47.369 --> 00:17:49.992
Because it's a porous
material, as I showed you

00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:52.299
before, you could fill this up
with cells.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:56.560
The experiment that was done
here is that these materials,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.223
these porous materials were
seeded with cells from

00:18:00.223 --> 00:18:02.531
cartilage,
and the cells that make up

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.230
cartilage are called
chondrocytes.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.153
Samples of cartilage were
obtained, digested down to

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:09.619
individual cells,
those cells were grown and

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:11.970
cultured until you had a lot of
them,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.221
and then cells were put here,
put here, put here,

00:18:15.221 --> 00:18:18.539
and then they were implanted
back into animals.

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:23.247
Here's what comes out of the
animal several months later,

00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:27.703
and what you see is material
that looks very much like

00:18:27.703 --> 00:18:30.079
cartilage.
A couple of things are

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:32.218
interesting;
one is that these things have

00:18:32.218 --> 00:18:35.242
maintained their shapes even
though they weren't implanted

00:18:35.242 --> 00:18:38.803
into animals for many months.
The shape that you make the

00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:43.150
original material in leads to a
tissue that's that same shape.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.820
If you look microscopically
inside these tissues,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.991
you'd find that they look like
cartilage in many respects,

00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:51.049
they look like natural
cartilage.

00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:54.432
That is the chondrocytes,
or the individual cells that we

00:18:54.432 --> 00:18:56.970
put on here, multiplied inside
the body,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.001
inside the scaffold,
and they filled it up,

00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:04.460
they filled up the space.
The tissue that you get looks

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.330
like the scaffold that you use.
This is a microscopic image

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.310
of some of those,
so imagine you cut this one

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.240
down the middle and then you
looked under a microscope.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.369
This is what normal cartilage
looks like.

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:21.787
You can see the chondrocytes
here, the white regions,

00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:25.664
and the chondrocytes excrete
and extra cellular matrix which

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.950
is stained red in this
particular preparation.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.548
If you look at this cartilage
that was formed by tissue

00:19:31.548 --> 00:19:33.809
engineering, you'll see some
structures here.

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:37.619
Some long structures,
these are residual fibers.

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:40.307
The polymer fibers haven't
completely degraded at this

00:19:40.307 --> 00:19:43.349
point, but you see a lot of
cells, a lot of healthy cells.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:46.362
You see they're almost at the
same density that they are in

00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:49.114
the natural cartilage,
so the cells have multiplied to

00:19:49.114 --> 00:19:52.695
reach sort of a natural state.
They're secreting an

00:19:52.695 --> 00:19:56.553
extracellular matrix,
they're making their own micro

00:19:56.553 --> 00:20:00.789
environment by secreting
molecules and so they also stain

00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:03.091
red.
Now it's not as deep a red as

00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:06.054
here, they're not making as much
as natural cartilage,

00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:10.049
but they're on their way.
Here's an example of taking a

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:15.244
material, being able to fashion
it into a particular shape that

00:20:15.244 --> 00:20:17.649
you want,
being able to control the

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.952
microstructure so that you can
put cells in it in such a way

00:20:20.952 --> 00:20:23.808
that cells develop into
something that's starting to

00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:31.087
look very much like tissue.
Now this was done in the

00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:36.435
late 1980s I believe.
At this time,

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:41.372
the scientists that were doing
it were trying to make the point

00:20:41.372 --> 00:20:45.275
that there was a lot of
potential for this kind of

00:20:45.275 --> 00:20:48.682
strategy.
One place where you might want

00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:52.119
to make new cartilage is in
plastic surgery.

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:57.254
People that have lost tissue
due to cancer or to a birth

00:20:57.254 --> 00:21:02.950
defect, maybe they're missing
some cartilage in their nose.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.099
There are diseases where
children are born without

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.670
functional cartilage in their
ribcage.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.363
There are even some traumas
where people might lose an ear,

00:21:12.363 --> 00:21:15.930
and your ear is basically skin
covered with cartilage.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.172
They did this experiment mainly
to make a point and so I'll show

00:21:20.172 --> 00:21:22.603
it to you.
Instead of making a

00:21:22.603 --> 00:21:26.274
triangle or a square,
or a cross, they made a polymer

00:21:26.274 --> 00:21:30.793
scaffold that looks a little bit
like a human ear and they filled

00:21:30.793 --> 00:21:33.970
this scaffold--this is 100%
polymer now,

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.575
there's no tissue in here,
but then they added cartilage

00:21:37.575 --> 00:21:39.505
cells.
They added chondrocytes and

00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:42.472
they implanted it back into an
animal at a site where they

00:21:42.472 --> 00:21:45.700
could easily see it.
They implanted it into the ear

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.429
of a rabbit.
Over time, what happened was

00:21:48.429 --> 00:21:52.063
the cartilage cells that were in
this scaffold grew into

00:21:52.063 --> 00:21:56.160
cartilage in the same shape as
the scaffold that they used.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.030
Here's what looks like a human
ear growing on the ear of a

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.486
rabbit.
A dramatic demonstration,

00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:06.523
and when they took this ear out
of the rabbit,

00:22:06.523 --> 00:22:09.695
obviously it's not a real ear,
it doesn't hear,

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:12.887
but it has--it's all the
cartilage that forms the outer

00:22:12.887 --> 00:22:16.177
part of your ear.
If you took a section of this

00:22:16.177 --> 00:22:19.883
later and looked inside,
it would look just like the

00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:22.500
cartilage that's inside your
ear.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.102
You could use this same
strategy to make other kinds of

00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:27.531
tissues as well.
I'm going to return to the

00:22:27.531 --> 00:22:30.835
example of coronary arteries
because that's such a big

00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:33.080
medical problem around the
world;

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.772
coronary heart disease.
Heart disease is either the

00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:40.369
number one or number two killer
around the world.

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:44.268
Certainly in countries that are
developed like the U.S.,

00:22:44.268 --> 00:22:48.450
heart disease and cancer are
the leading causes of death.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.636
A lot of the death from heart
disease comes from failure of

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:54.470
your coronary arteries.
One of the most performed

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.858
surgical operations in the
United States is coronary artery

00:22:57.858 --> 00:23:01.749
bypass surgery.
You probably all know somebody

00:23:01.749 --> 00:23:06.103
who has got it,
maybe a grandparent or a family

00:23:06.103 --> 00:23:08.790
friend.
It's not an uncommon surgery

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.084
and it's not perfect yet,
and we talked about the ways

00:23:12.084 --> 00:23:16.061
that it's not perfect last time.
What if you could grow,

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:19.263
outside of the body,
blood vessels that you could

00:23:19.263 --> 00:23:22.599
use to replace the vessels
inside of a patient?

00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:24.890
People have been working on
this for a long time.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.722
Here's an initial attempt.
This is a tube that was made of

00:23:28.722 --> 00:23:32.140
a polymer, and in this case it
was a polymer.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.855
It was a natural polymer
collagen, so sort of like that

00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:39.846
collagen gel that I talked about
several slides ago that we

00:23:39.846 --> 00:23:42.529
suspended the endothelial cells
in,

00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:46.869
only this time it's made into
the form of a tube.

00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:51.412
The idea was to take those
endothelial cells and coat the

00:23:51.412 --> 00:23:54.819
inside of this tube with
endothelial cells.

00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:58.708
Make a tube that's mechanically
strong that will stay like a

00:23:58.708 --> 00:24:02.201
tube, but coat it with the
natural cells that form the

00:24:02.201 --> 00:24:04.640
lining inside your blood
vessels.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.800
Allow it to develop and
culture, to the point where you

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.960
have a natural endothelial cell
lining,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.307
and then implant this back into
an animal in place of its own

00:24:17.307 --> 00:24:19.741
artery.
What you hope is that blood

00:24:19.741 --> 00:24:22.701
will flow through here,
and it should flow because

00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:26.656
there's an opening,
and that the blood won't clot,

00:24:26.656 --> 00:24:31.472
because now instead of an
artificial material you have a

00:24:31.472 --> 00:24:35.500
lining of blood vessel cells on
the inside.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.349
This is a picture from
studies that were done in the

00:24:39.349 --> 00:24:43.410
early 1980s on this approach and
there was some success.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.970
You could make them work for
some period of time,

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.890
but they always eventually
failed,

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.449
and I won't go through the
whole history of this but

00:24:50.449 --> 00:24:53.559
there's a long history of people
trying different materials,

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:56.849
different ways of putting cells
on different sources of cells.

00:24:56.849 --> 00:24:59.439
All the things that you could
imagine changing,

00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:02.930
and all of them working for a
little while and then failing.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.187
You can imagine it's a hard
engineering problem,

00:25:05.187 --> 00:25:06.819
a difficult engineering
problem,

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:11.156
because you need to make this
material strong enough that it

00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:14.696
serves as a vessel.
It's got to withstand blood

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:17.941
pressure, not burst.
It's got to be strong enough to

00:25:17.941 --> 00:25:21.434
put a stitch into because you've
got to sew this into the natural

00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:23.455
artery.
It's got to have good

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:27.952
mechanical properties on its own
but still allow the formation of

00:25:27.952 --> 00:25:32.183
a natural tissue around it.
All those criteria turn out to

00:25:32.183 --> 00:25:33.740
be difficult to meet.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.044
I want to talk in detail
about an advance that was made

00:25:41.044 --> 00:25:44.353
by someone who's now here at
Yale, a woman named Lauren

00:25:44.353 --> 00:25:46.423
Niklason.
She's in our department of

00:25:46.423 --> 00:25:48.529
Biomedical Engineering and
Anesthesiology.

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:51.591
When she started looking at
this problem,

00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.728
she thought,
'Well, everything that's done

00:25:54.728 --> 00:25:59.549
is working kind of but it's not
quite working well enough.'

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:02.959
The vessels when you put them
in the body they don't develop

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:06.310
the way that normal vessels do,
they don't develop a normal

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.320
structure.
She thought maybe that's

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.731
because we're not exposing them
to the kinds of environments

00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:18.400
that arteries normally develop
under.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.535
When our arteries developed
during embryonic development

00:26:23.535 --> 00:26:27.269
they developed as the heart
developed.

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:32.577
While they were developing and
turning from just collections of

00:26:32.577 --> 00:26:36.959
cells into arterial tissue,
they were exposed to flowing

00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:40.690
blood because the embryonic
heart was already beating,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.990
there's already an immature
circulatory system.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:49.920
These arteries developed in the
presence of a beating heart.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.232
What if you simulated that
in cell culture and took these

00:26:54.232 --> 00:26:58.113
tissue engineered structures
that are polymer scaffolds

00:26:58.113 --> 00:27:01.059
filled with the right kinds of
cells.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:06.674
You hook them up to--on both
ends to a tube where you can

00:27:06.674 --> 00:27:12.189
expose them to blood flow and
blood pressure and build a

00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:16.099
reactor around these blood
vessels,

00:27:16.099 --> 00:27:19.029
so that as they're developing
outside the body.

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:22.542
You can control the conditions
that they're grown under so that

00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:25.657
it's close to the conditions
that a natural artery would

00:27:25.657 --> 00:27:28.660
experience when it's developing
inside an embryo.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.915
This shows some of the things
that she did in order to create

00:27:33.915 --> 00:27:36.960
this environment.
Here's a picture of a

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.510
bioreactor, here is an
artificial blood vessel that she

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.810
made in the laboratory.
Again, this is a polymer

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.454
scaffold, the same kind of
scaffold I showed you several

00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:52.758
slides ago of a material,
a network, an unwoven fiber

00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:58.193
mesh, and formed into a tube.
Smooth muscle cells or the

00:27:58.193 --> 00:28:01.153
internal cells of the artery are
cultured inside,

00:28:01.153 --> 00:28:03.619
and then it's placed in this
reactor.

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:06.548
You can see it's hooked up to
two tubes here,

00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:10.009
so blood is constantly flowing
through the inside.

00:28:10.009 --> 00:28:14.199
It's flowing in a pulsatile
manner just like our blood is

00:28:14.199 --> 00:28:18.240
flowing through our coronary
arteries or our artery.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.854
She found that if she did
this they developed into tissues

00:28:21.854 --> 00:28:24.839
that looked much,
much more like real arteries

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:28.890
and that you could take these
and implant them into animals.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.299
One is shown here,
in the carotid,

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:35.681
this is in the neck of a large
animal, I think either a sheep

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:39.842
or a pig I'm not sure which one.
It's stitched into place,

00:28:39.842 --> 00:28:43.335
the animal then leaves the
operating room with a new blood

00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:46.890
vessel which you can study by
using imaging techniques.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.720
You can follow this blood
vessel.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.140
They've done this for many,
many months now,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.760
even years in some cases.
You can form vessels that are

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.034
smaller than any that have been
transplanted in this way and

00:28:59.034 --> 00:29:02.150
they maintain their function in
culture.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.581
I show this because it's an
exciting example of tissue

00:29:06.581 --> 00:29:08.731
engineering.
It's also, I think,

00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:11.692
a good illustration of one of
the advantages of tissue

00:29:11.692 --> 00:29:15.342
engineering,
in that you can create a tissue

00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:18.789
outside by arranging things
together.

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:21.875
You can maintain it under
controlled conditions in the

00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:24.670
laboratory until its ready to be
transplanted.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.109
Then, you can transplant it at
the right time.

00:29:27.109 --> 00:29:30.371
All of these things are under
control so it could be optimized

00:29:30.371 --> 00:29:32.349
to produce the best quality
tissue.

00:29:32.349 --> 00:29:35.171
In this case,
they've cultured the vessels

00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:39.370
for eight weeks in order to get
the kind of function that they

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.940
want.
I think you can imagine from

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.188
these examples I've shown you,
lots of different ways that you

00:29:46.188 --> 00:29:50.228
could build outside the body
neo-tissues or structures that

00:29:50.228 --> 00:29:54.049
will develop into,
hopefully, real tissues.

00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:59.516
This illustration is just
to sort of show you all of the

00:29:59.516 --> 00:30:03.155
kinds of tissues that,
at this point in time,

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:07.210
people have tried to make using
tissue engineering approaches.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.124
Many of you might know Erin
Lavik in our Biomedical

00:30:10.124 --> 00:30:13.272
Engineering Department,
who's been working and has some

00:30:13.272 --> 00:30:16.420
fabulous results on tissue
engineering to create spinal

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.590
cords,
to treat injured spinal cords.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.445
There's many examples like this.
There's already tissue

00:30:24.445 --> 00:30:27.640
engineered skin that's available
for physicians to use.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.866
The other thing I tried to show
you with this diagram is that

00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:35.881
what you're trying to achieve
while you might be using the

00:30:35.881 --> 00:30:38.769
same approaches that I've shown
here,

00:30:38.769 --> 00:30:41.268
you're trying to achieve
different things in different

00:30:41.268 --> 00:30:43.440
tissues.
Some things you're trying

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.200
to replace structure,
mainly.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.303
If I'm trying to use this
approach to make new bone I'm

00:30:48.303 --> 00:30:50.660
trying to make new structural
material.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.085
What I care about is the
mechanical properties of the

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:58.086
tissue that I create;
at least I care about that a

00:30:58.086 --> 00:31:00.248
lot.
A bone that cannot

00:31:00.248 --> 00:31:05.879
form--perform the mechanical
functions of bone is not a very

00:31:05.879 --> 00:31:08.903
good bone.
It has to have the right

00:31:08.903 --> 00:31:12.470
elastic modulus,
which we talked about earlier.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.498
In other tissues you're trying
to replace metabolism or the

00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:20.250
cellular biochemistry that goes
on inside the cells.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.255
In the liver,
you don't care so much about

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.259
the mechanical properties of the
liver,

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:28.052
you care that all the cells are
performing all the metabolic

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:31.009
properties that a liver
ordinarily performs;

00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:33.869
that table of things I showed
you last time.

00:31:33.869 --> 00:31:35.883
In the pancreas,
in the same way,

00:31:35.883 --> 00:31:38.903
you're trying to create a
tissue that forms a metabolic

00:31:38.903 --> 00:31:40.689
function.
In the pancreas,

00:31:40.689 --> 00:31:44.333
one of the most important
metabolic functions is that it

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:48.440
senses glucose and secretes
insulin in response to glucose.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.847
You don't care about the
structure you care about the

00:31:50.847 --> 00:31:53.278
metabolism.
There are some things like

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.019
blood vessels where you're in
between.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:59.162
A blood vessel needs to perform
the mechanical function,

00:31:59.162 --> 00:32:02.590
needs to serve as a physical
plumbing to carry blood from one

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.069
place to another.
It also performs a biological

00:32:06.069 --> 00:32:10.708
function, it carries the blood
and it anti-coagulates at the

00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:15.805
same time, it stops coagulation.
There are many other

00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:21.670
biochemical functions that blood
vessels perform.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.412
The next aspect of tissue
engineering I want to focus on

00:32:25.412 --> 00:32:29.090
is that tissue engineering often
uses cellular processes to

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.240
control drug delivery.
This provides a new way to do

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.448
drug delivery to supplement the
kinds of engineering approaches

00:32:35.448 --> 00:32:38.720
we talked about a few weeks ago.
Now how might you do that?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.135
Well, let's imagine,
just look on this side of the

00:32:42.135 --> 00:32:45.619
slide here, and imagine you have
a hollow fiber.

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:49.248
A hollow fiber is a fiber that
has an outside diameter,

00:32:49.248 --> 00:32:52.944
and then it's hollow on the
inside, made of some kind of

00:32:52.944 --> 00:32:56.597
synthetic material.
It might look like a straw,

00:32:56.597 --> 00:33:00.812
like a straw that you drink
through, only the straw has

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.812
special properties.
In general it's much,

00:33:03.812 --> 00:33:06.559
much thinner than a drinking
straw would be.

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:10.995
This might be a millimeter
across instead of several

00:33:10.995 --> 00:33:14.910
millimeters like a drinking
straw would be.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.246
You fill this up with
cells, you fill up the hollow

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:21.227
fiber with cells.
The fiber is a special material

00:33:21.227 --> 00:33:24.609
in that: 1) it's biocompatible
so you can implant it in the

00:33:24.609 --> 00:33:27.700
body and the body doesn't
respond adversely to it,

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:35.797
and 2) it has a controlled
porosity so that molecules can

00:33:35.797 --> 00:33:39.263
pass in and out.
It's porous,

00:33:39.263 --> 00:33:43.435
it allows molecules to pass in
and out but it doesn't allow

00:33:43.435 --> 00:33:46.479
cells to pass in and out.
It's a filter,

00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:50.597
it's a porous filter that
allows small molecules to go in

00:33:50.597 --> 00:33:55.230
and out, but doesn't allow large
molecules to go in and out.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.019
Now, if this is filled up
with cells.

00:33:57.019 --> 00:33:59.829
I show this cut away so that
you can see inside.

00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:02.940
Here's little clusters of cells
growing inside,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.509
but it's a full cylinder in
reality.

00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:09.909
The ends are sealed and I
implant this into the body.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.057
Let's say I put it into the
abdominal cavity or I put it

00:34:13.057 --> 00:34:15.535
under the skin.
What you would like,

00:34:15.535 --> 00:34:19.902
then, is for these cells to be
able to communicate with the

00:34:19.902 --> 00:34:23.139
body through molecules but not
directly.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:28.195
They're isolated from the body
because this hollow fiber is

00:34:28.195 --> 00:34:33.237
surrounding them everywhere.
What if these were cells from

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:36.594
the pancreas?
Then, maybe glucose,

00:34:36.594 --> 00:34:41.071
blood sugar,
could diffuse or move through

00:34:41.071 --> 00:34:46.860
the wall of this hollow fiber,
exposing these cells to

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.258
glucose.
The cells would sense the

00:34:49.258 --> 00:34:51.567
glucose is there because they're
cells from the pancreas and

00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:54.710
they're functioning normally.
They would secrete insulin in

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.349
response to glucose.
The insulin would flow out,

00:34:58.349 --> 00:35:01.880
and then into blood vessels
outside here.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.179
Now why go to all this
trouble?

00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:11.010
Why not just inject these cells
right into the body?

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.190
Why surround them by this
hollow fiber?

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.377
What do you think would happen
if you just injected them under

00:35:22.377 --> 00:35:25.960
the skin or you injected them
into the abdominal cavity?

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.513
Caitlin?Student:
There would be an

00:35:27.513 --> 00:35:29.560
infection.Professor Mark
Saltzman: They would be

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.220
recognized as foreign by the
immune system,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:37.913
unless they were your cells.
You need this treatment because

00:35:37.913 --> 00:35:41.078
your cells aren't working
properly so you don't have any

00:35:41.078 --> 00:35:45.023
pancreas cells to contribute.
The cells either have to come

00:35:45.023 --> 00:35:47.344
from somebody else,
an allograph,

00:35:47.344 --> 00:35:50.670
foreign to you.
It could even be a zenograph;

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.619
it might be cells from another
species.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.869
They might be cells from a pig,
for example.

00:35:57.869 --> 00:36:01.583
It turns out that the insulin
that pigs make is very similar

00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:04.016
to human insulin.
Not exactly the same but very

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:06.462
similar.
So, for decades and decades,

00:36:06.462 --> 00:36:10.661
until we discovered ways to
make recombinant human insulin

00:36:10.661 --> 00:36:14.024
in the 1980s,
pig insulin was the primary

00:36:14.024 --> 00:36:17.099
source of insulin to treat
diabetics.

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:23.215
Why not use cells from a
species where cells are readily

00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:29.331
available and put them inside of
a capsule like this so that

00:36:29.331 --> 00:36:35.343
they're separated from your
immune system but still able to

00:36:35.343 --> 00:36:40.125
function as a pancreas?
In a sense, it's functioning as

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:44.030
a drug delivery system.
The drug here is insulin.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.074
It's a smart drug delivery
system, and it has the

00:36:47.074 --> 00:36:50.690
intelligence of the cells that
are encapsulated inside.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.277
It's smart in what way?
It's smart in effect that it

00:36:54.277 --> 00:36:58.767
can detect the presence of
glucose and secrete insulin only

00:36:58.767 --> 00:37:02.559
when glucose is present and
insulin is needed.

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:06.164
If this was used to treat
Diabetes, if you were a diabetic

00:37:06.164 --> 00:37:09.642
you wouldn't have to be checking
your glucose levels and

00:37:09.642 --> 00:37:13.183
adjusting how much you inject
because you'd have a system

00:37:13.183 --> 00:37:17.230
inside your body that's doing it
automatically in the way,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.739
hopefully, that a normal
pancreas is.

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:23.824
What I show on the left
hand side of the graph here is

00:37:23.824 --> 00:37:28.123
some different configurations
that people have now made using

00:37:28.123 --> 00:37:32.214
this same concept.
It doesn't have to be a hollow

00:37:32.214 --> 00:37:36.489
fiber, but you can make a
micro-capsule like this.

00:37:36.489 --> 00:37:39.697
Remember when you made the
alginate particles in the

00:37:39.697 --> 00:37:42.630
section meeting?
We mentioned that not only

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.716
could you put food coloring
inside these particles but maybe

00:37:46.716 --> 00:37:50.110
you could put cells inside
these--and you can.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.119
You can put cells inside these
particles and make little

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:56.456
capsules that have cells on the
inside but are surrounded by a

00:37:56.456 --> 00:37:59.519
barrier that keeps them away
from the immune system.

00:37:59.519 --> 00:38:02.320
There are a variety of other
ways of doing this as well.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.904
This next slide,
just shows you the advantage of

00:38:05.904 --> 00:38:08.785
this strategy,
here the dashed line is the

00:38:08.785 --> 00:38:12.370
membrane whether it's formed by
a hollow fiber or an

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.943
alginate--or a hydrogel seal,
engineered cells are on the

00:38:16.943 --> 00:38:19.469
inside.
Now, I talked about putting

00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:23.549
cells from an animal inside but
maybe you could genetically

00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:27.840
engineer beta-cells so that they
function for a long time.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.104
Maybe you could take a
patient's own diseased cells and

00:38:31.104 --> 00:38:34.481
genetically engineer them so
they work properly and then give

00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:37.605
them back.
Maybe you could take cells from

00:38:37.605 --> 00:38:42.199
the pancreas of an individual
donor, genetically engineer them

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:46.300
so that they grow in culture,
and then they'd be available to

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.825
treat lots of patients.
The idea is that nutrients,

00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:54.175
oxygen, glucose can come
inside, insulin can come back

00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:59.510
out, but that the immune system
won't recognize it as foreign.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.829
Now, this is an idea that's
also been around for a long

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:03.144
time.
There's been a lot of people

00:39:03.144 --> 00:39:05.139
that have worked on it,
great progress has been made.

00:39:05.139 --> 00:39:07.750
It turns out to be a
tremendously challenging

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.192
engineering problem because you
need to engineer a material

00:39:11.192 --> 00:39:14.811
that's compatible with the body
that doesn't--that allows only

00:39:14.811 --> 00:39:18.550
the passage of certain molecules
and not other molecules.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.019
It has to allow insulin to pass
but not antibodies.

00:39:22.019 --> 00:39:26.062
It has to do that very reliably
without allowing any immune

00:39:26.062 --> 00:39:30.036
system components to come
inside, and it has to do it at a

00:39:30.036 --> 00:39:32.890
high enough rate.
You have to not only allow

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.856
insulin to go through;
you have to allow it to go

00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:39.664
through in large quantities so
that you can provide enough

00:39:39.664 --> 00:39:43.338
insulin in order to treat
Diabetes without having a huge

00:39:43.338 --> 00:39:45.968
device.
It needs to be small and

00:39:45.968 --> 00:39:50.059
produce a lot of insulin.
These turn out to be challenges

00:39:50.059 --> 00:39:52.510
that we haven't quite achieved
yet.

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:02.000
Let me just summarize what
we've talked about.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.532
In the field of tissue
engineering, which I think

00:40:05.532 --> 00:40:09.433
you're going to see make a lot
of progress during your

00:40:09.433 --> 00:40:11.669
lifetime.
A logical extension of

00:40:11.669 --> 00:40:14.169
conventional medical and
surgical practices,

00:40:14.169 --> 00:40:17.599
it involves the control or
regulation of normal healing.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:20.286
We talked about tissue
engineering approaches that use

00:40:20.286 --> 00:40:23.480
cells and tissue engineering
approaches that don't use cells,

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.930
where the material or some
other aspect of what you're

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.340
using controls the healing
process.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.797
We talked about tissue
engineering to supplement the

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:36.186
cellular component,
and even to guide the ways that

00:40:36.186 --> 00:40:40.050
cells form into new tissues to
control drug delivery.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.058
This last aspect,
which I think you can probably

00:40:43.058 --> 00:40:46.480
see more clearly now then when I
mentioned it last time,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.443
is that now you could use these
new tissues that are created in

00:40:50.443 --> 00:40:53.383
the laboratory to understand
physiology better.

00:40:53.383 --> 00:40:56.671
You could take Dr.
Niklason's tissue engineered

00:40:56.671 --> 00:41:00.704
blood vessels and use them to
understand more about how blood

00:41:00.704 --> 00:41:03.929
vessels develop during embryonic
development,

00:41:03.929 --> 00:41:07.031
because she's created a system
where she can control many of

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:09.303
the key variable.
You could add cells at

00:41:09.303 --> 00:41:12.776
different time and see how this
developing tissue responds to

00:41:12.776 --> 00:41:14.337
that.
You could add signaling

00:41:14.337 --> 00:41:17.297
molecules at different times and
see how this developing tissue

00:41:17.297 --> 00:41:19.969
remodels or responds to these
signals that you added.

00:41:19.969 --> 00:41:23.580
These turn out to get very
powerful tools,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:28.510
not only for creating new
therapies but for understanding

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.588
human physiology.
I'm going to stop there but

00:41:32.588 --> 00:41:37.034
there's some time for questions.
It could be questions about

00:41:37.034 --> 00:41:41.567
this or last minute questions
about your papers that are due

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:43.880
tomorrow.
Any questions about that?

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.700
I know I've answered quite a
few by email,

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.920
it seemed like everybody was on
the right track.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:58.106
No, everybody's good?
Good, so I'll see you in

00:41:58.106 --> 00:41:59.706
section this afternoon.

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.645
Today we're going to talk
about Ireland and England,

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:07.515
predominantly England not
because Ireland isn't important,

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.340
but because we know
less about Ireland.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.205
The reason we know relatively

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.355
more about England in
its Post Roman period,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:24.090
that is to say after 420 is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.965
because of the historian Bede

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:33.015
writing in the early
eighth century,

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:37.150
a monk at Jarrow

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.605
which was a part of
a twin monastery in Northumbria.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.400
You can see on your map
the Northeastern

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.180
part of England before you
get to what's now Scotland.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.470
Bede wrote among other things

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.600
a history of the English
church and people,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.295
which is full of miracles

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:05.210
and very pro Christian as
much as Gregory of Tour,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.410
but is a much more easy

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.150
to follow narrative and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.490
a narrative with
a certain kind of point.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.230
It's about the
conversion of England

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.630
and the establishment
of the church.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.710
The other advantage for
England over Ireland in

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.665
terms of evidence is archaeology.

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.600
A lot more has been done with

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.370
excavating sites in England,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.820
and by England we mean
literally England,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.605
the part that is not Wales,

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:38.210
not Scotland, not Ireland,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.395
the part of the British
Isles, the ensemble.

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:44.035
Essentially the two islands

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.450
are referred to as
the British Isles.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.680
Britain is England, Scotland,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.455
and Wales, Ireland is Ireland.

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:56.505
The Britons however,
B-R-I-T-O-N-S,

00:01:56.505 --> 00:02:00.610
are the collective term
for the Celtic population.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.055
Celtic is both a linguistic group

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.625
and a somewhat vague ethnic term.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.085
It means the people
who were there

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.970
in the British Isles
before the Romans came,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.570
and who were there afterwards

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.550
fighting invaders from Europe.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.950
These invaders who come in the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.025
440 is known as the Anglo-Saxons.

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.700
Bede tells us it's
the Anglo at the Saxons,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.485
excuse me, the Angles,

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.190
the Saxons and the Jews.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.734
The Angles give
their name to England,

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:44.265
Angle land, the Jews
we know nothing about.

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:47.100
So a certain kind of

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.965
medievalist will go on
about funding a journal of

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.650
jute studies and inviting

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.855
contributors to something
that we really have

00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:59.540
absolutely no idea of it
being in that league of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.510
smallest thinnest bond
[inaudible]

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.450
at least in terms of
three-dimensional books.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.660
The Saxons come from there

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.050
is still a very large part
of Germany called Saxony.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.690
What the nature of
these peoples are,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.280
how they were
differentiated among

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.940
themselves is
a source of a lot of

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.760
real or at least it looks

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.090
real scholarship as opposed
to studying the Jews,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.845
but we don't have
to go into that.

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:30.020
But you need to get
the cast of characters.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.155
Celts, Anglo-Saxons,
the Anglo-Saxons

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:39.650
conquer much of
the island more or

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.235
less what would become
England but not all.

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:45.380
They do not conquer Scotland,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.585
they do not conquer Wales,

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:49.625
and they don't really
conquer Cornwall.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.960
So the Western part of
Britain remains Celtic

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.540
and to this day Wales and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.490
Scotland considered themselves
different from England.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.735
You can get into a lot
of trouble by calling

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:06.500
that area England
with the people there

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.920
and particularly in
Scotland there's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.735
a possibility that
they may separate

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:15.035
from the United Kingdom
at some point.

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:19.655
Ireland, Ireland was never
occupied by the Romans.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.600
Ireland was chaotic,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.960
was in contact with
the Roman Empire,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.025
but was not part of it.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:32.930
This makes some
difference and we'll

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.510
talk about it when we come
to talk about conversion,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.700
but it doesn't make
as much difference as it sounds

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.265
because the thing
about England or

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:43.415
Britain is that the Roman impress

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:47.585
there would be almost wiped
out once the Romans withdrew.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:50.660
So in contrast to what we saw

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.540
with Gregory of Tour
and Merovingian Gaul,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.709
Merovingian Frankish kingdom,

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:03.410
the Roman influence in
Britain is almost wiped out.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.720
Recall what we saw as
persistence of Roman practices

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.959
in the Merovingian kingdom,
bishops, cities,

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:25.280
the Latin language, tax
records, written legal codes,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.080
that is not to say that the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.700
Merovingians weren't as I said

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.015
before to be described by
technical terms like thugs,

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:39.480
or that this was a sleek
well-functioning Kingdom,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.360
you landed at the airport

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.660
and got the train immediately
and everything was

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.330
sleek and nice like Amsterdam or

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.630
someplace like that as
opposed to Kennedy.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.605
But that the Roman inheritance

00:05:56.605 --> 00:05:59.880
was visible and influential.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.470
In Britain when
the Roman troops withdrew to

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.025
fight the invaders in Gaul,

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:13.630
this ended Roman
society in Britain.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.660
The reason for this is

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.370
partly that Britain
was a frontier,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.630
viewed from the point of view of

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.220
the Mediterranean the center

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.840
of gravity of the Roman Empire.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.960
The frontier symbolized most

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.010
dramatically by walls the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.570
most famous of which
is Hadrian's Wall,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.250
a wall that separated
out the Barbarians.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.050
But since you didn't have a river

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.090
like the Danube or the Rhine,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.640
there seemed to be
no natural frontier.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.055
Remnants of Hadrian's Wall are

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:53.080
the largest souvenir
of the Roman era,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.580
a wall to keep out
the Barbarians from the North

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.690
because in fact the Romans didn't

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.385
conquer the entire island.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.810
They conquered the parts they
thought were worthwhile,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.835
and they did think
it was worthwhile.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:07.010
Frontier or not, we know that
the Romans built villas,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.959
might be a little cold

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:12.020
the somewhat open-air
Mediterranean plan things,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.330
but Mosaic courtyards,
drank a lot of wine,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.729
much of it imported,
built cities,

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:27.395
walls, other fortifications,
cultivated land.

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:32.030
So it's not as if there wasn't
a serious Roman province

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.530
of Britain from its conquest
in the late first century,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.715
until its abandonment in
the early fifth century.

00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:45.230
But here the invaders
tended to obliterate

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.719
much of what had been
there in Roman times,

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.610
and the Celtic population who had

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.400
been Romanized at least
at the elite levels,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.755
the Celtic population didn't

00:07:57.755 --> 00:08:01.850
really save very much
from the Roman Empire.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.250
The Celts might remain

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.160
Christian whereas
the invaders were Pagan.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.665
But the Celts tended not to have

00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:17.200
cities or at least large centers,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.820
and they tended not to have or

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.745
retain Roman forms of government.

00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:25.785
The one kind of,

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:28.200
if not literally interesting

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.360
at least weird aspect of

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.990
Celtic Roman Resistance is
the figure of King Arthur.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.655
I'm going to bring him up now

00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:37.230
and then I'm going to drop him.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.050
King Arthur belongs properly to

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.780
the continuation of
this course because

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.700
his legendary status starts

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.690
really in the world of romance,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.460
of French romance and then of

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.550
international romance
chivalric literature.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.890
By romance we mean, not only

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.365
love stories but
novels of chivalry,

00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:04.020
of knights, of battles.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:10.365
He is a figure who is
99.9 percent legend.

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:15.000
Whatever the remainder of
that 0.1 percent real.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.320
So far as he's real,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.255
he may be identified with

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:21.390
Celtic resistance to
the Anglo-Saxon invaders,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.060
Celtic Roman resistance in

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.550
the late fifth, early
sixth centuries.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:34.695
But the proportion of art
to history in this is,

00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:38.895
if not 99.9 at least
very, very substantial.

00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:43.800
The original setting of
the Arthurian stories

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.330
is that of the resistance to
the Anglo-Saxon invaders.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.200
The Arthurian romances do

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.470
have a Celtic beginning,
well not a kind of,

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.015
they have a Celtic beginning,

00:09:57.015 --> 00:09:59.385
and then they are
appropriated by people

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:02.160
in the Romance
language tradition,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.870
French, first of all.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.499
So as Walkom says on page 151,

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:14.130
nowhere else in the Roman Empire

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.975
was the collapse of culture,

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:19.080
economy and urbanization
so complete.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.135
He uses that wonderful phrase

00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:26.575
again, radical economic
simplification,

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:31.020
ie, there's no more plumbing,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.350
there's no more of what we would

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.860
consider to be
affluent civilized society.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.605
The ceramics don't come
from Africa anymore,

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:43.155
the wine doesn't come
from France anymore,

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:46.455
people are reduced to

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:48.120
a kind of subsistence or

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.130
at least most people
because as we'll see,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.170
some of these kings
actually are able to

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.470
get some luxury goods
from abroad.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.200
If it were just a story
of barbarisation,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.745
it would be less
interesting then.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:07.770
In fact, the peculiar nature
of England in this period,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.850
which goes from being
a contested territory

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.650
between the Germanic invaders
and the Celtic population,

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.640
to a kingdoms slowly converted in

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.200
the course of the seventh century

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.930
to Christianity from paganism,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.970
to the leading center
of culture in Europe.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:35.220
Bede, who lived from 673-735 was

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.260
the most cultivated scholar in

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.130
Europe of the early
eighth century.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.440
The most cultivated
scholar in Europe of

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.990
the late eighth century
was also from England,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:54.880
Alcuin, counselor and
adviser to Charlemagne.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.080
How do you go from being

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:08.025
a barbarian enough area

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:10.950
to having the largest libraries,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.210
the most cultivated scholars?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.910
Now, it is true as I
think I've said before

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.240
that any time you can say

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.405
that such and such a person
was the smartest person

00:12:24.405 --> 00:12:28.335
in Europe has got to
be a fairly bad time.

00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:30.210
In the 19th century,

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.345
you have your choice from
all sorts of scientific,

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.840
literary, other kinds of

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.295
intellectual experts who
would even dare to say.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:46.580
But we know that Boethius
and Cassiodorus are

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.380
the smartest guys in Europe in

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.150
the sixth century
because they have

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.430
access to stuff that
almost no one else does,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.200
because their writing about

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.180
classical authors
that almost no one

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.570
else has in their libraries.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.500
We know that Isidore
of Seville is probably

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.790
the smartest guy of

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.300
the early seventh century,
and Visigothic Spain.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.355
Because we have his works,

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.260
we have an idea of
what he's read,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.805
we know his sources

00:13:11.805 --> 00:13:14.970
and again he's got
the biggest library.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.320
Biggest library may
mean 100 books,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.825
but 100 books in 700 AD

00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:24.135
is a serious collection
of knowledge.

00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:26.715
Now, this is not easy knowledge,

00:13:26.715 --> 00:13:30.850
this is not as if everything were

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.005
like Wikipedia five years ago,

00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:44.975
elementary and often wrong,

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:48.510
these are very different kinds

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.715
of works from what
might interest us.

00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:52.770
Certainly a lot of
biblical stuff,

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.535
but also for example a lot
of computing of time.

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:59.220
Bede would be remembered

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.395
for the history of
the English church and people,

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:07.320
but also for a lot of his
works on figuring out time.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.740
He is credited, although
not uniquely credited,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.125
but as an important person
in the development

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:16.440
of the BC, AD scheme.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.990
Believe it or not people
are not born into

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.665
the world calculating
according to BC, AD,

00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:25.305
lots of people calculate
according to other systems,

00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:26.895
how did they come up with this,

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:31.770
and moreover how do they then
fit the calendar into it?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.560
How do you keep
time when you don't

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.385
have electric or battery
operated clocks?

00:14:38.385 --> 00:14:42.430
How do you know what
the seasonal changes are?

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.545
But in fact the most
troublesome problem

00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:48.510
which had been particularly

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.940
controversial to the conversion

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.225
of England in the
generation before Bede,

00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:57.810
in the early seventh
and mid seventh century

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.315
was the calculation of Easter.

00:15:00.315 --> 00:15:03.030
Easter is a real problem.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.650
Now, naturally it's not

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.095
a problem if someone
else tells you.

00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:10.380
If in 1970 you open up

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.595
a little pocket book
calendar and it says,

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.755
okay, Easter is this day,

00:15:16.755 --> 00:15:20.070
you trust them, or now,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.080
if you have some feature on

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.930
your iPhone that gives

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.360
you Easter for the
next 3,000 years,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.600
in case you want to
know when Easter is in

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.180
3500 AD, no problem.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.800
But if you're out there in

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.980
Northumbria or anywhere
for that matter,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.660
in a monastery somewhere,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.370
where it's really crucial

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.380
to celebrate it on the right day.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.270
Remember what I said about dogma

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.880
and religious observation,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.235
God doesn't want you
to say something like,

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:55.440
"Dude, I don't really
know when Easter is,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.570
but I think I'm going
to celebrate it now."

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.550
You can't do that,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.645
you can't just decide,

00:16:00.645 --> 00:16:02.475
I know it's sort
of in the spring,

00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:04.680
nobody around here for miles and

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.900
miles and miles knows
how to calculate it,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.015
so what the heck,

00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:10.980
we'll do it on
a Tuesday because I'm

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.545
busy on what I think is Easter.

00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:15.630
That's not the way
monasticism works,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.745
and we'll talk about
that next week.

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.740
The schedule is really,
really important,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.340
but it's also difficult
to figure out,

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.645
and people disagree about it.

00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:27.125
To this day, the Eastern
Orthodox churches

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:29.060
celebrate a different date for

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.880
Easter than the Western

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.220
because they operate according
to a different calendar.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.060
All right. Well, I'm

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.070
not saying that this is
the kind of knowledge

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.440
that you ought to drop
everything else to pursue,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.855
but it is a knowledge
that requires

00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:48.145
a sort of observation that
in fact we do not have.

00:16:48.145 --> 00:16:50.780
Most of us unless
we're astronomy majors

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.765
have no idea what the sky
looks like at night.

00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:57.490
A, because we can't see it
because of artificial light,

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.570
and B, because we're
not very curious.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.510
We cannot track
animals most of us,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.089
and those of you who can,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.030
I'm interested in your knowledge.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.360
Most of us haven't
the faintest idea how things

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.510
grow except because we'd
been to the Yale Farm,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.660
and "Oh my gosh look
at this stuff."

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.930
That's part of the reason
for it because

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.730
we're not very close to nature.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.670
I think that
environmental concerns

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.305
notwithstanding most of us

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:38.260
have a huge investment in not
being too close to nature,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.710
but the observation of
phenomena is something that is

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.630
much superior in
so-called indigenous,

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:53.350
primitive, traditional
or historical societies.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.885
So the story of
England and Ireland,

00:17:58.885 --> 00:18:03.895
centers on conversion and
the reason this is so,

00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:09.415
is because conversion represents
a change in orientation.

00:18:09.415 --> 00:18:13.195
A change in orientation
towards a larger world.

00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:18.560
Instead of a tribal and
fragmented identity.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.610
I'm not making a statement about

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.445
the truth or non truth
of Christianity.

00:18:24.445 --> 00:18:26.290
But about the sense
of belonging to

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.365
a larger world whose purposes

00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:31.975
encompass not only your group

00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:35.695
but a larger group
of people out there.

00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:40.060
I think we can get
a feeling for this from

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.590
a famous passage of

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:46.690
Bede's Ecclesiastical history,
written in 731.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.770
He is describing events of
about a century earlier,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.950
when King Edwin of
Northumbria summoned

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.470
the council to decide whether or

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.010
not to accept the Christian God.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.410
The chief of the Pagan
priest's speaks in favor of

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.900
embracing Christianity
even though you

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.920
would think that he would be

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.765
the defender of the old faith,

00:19:10.765 --> 00:19:12.730
he in fact, speaks to

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.045
this assembly according
to Bede in favor

00:19:16.045 --> 00:19:20.020
of Christianity on
the grounds that

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.760
it tells us what went before

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.040
us and what will come after us.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.060
The passage goes like this,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.805
"And one of the King's Chief
men presently said,

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:33.895
thus seems it to me oh King.

00:19:33.895 --> 00:19:36.295
The present life of man on earth

00:19:36.295 --> 00:19:39.580
against that time
which is unknown to us

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.160
is as if you were sitting at

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.630
a feast with your chief
men and your Thanes",

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.850
nobles in winter time,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:55.810
T-H-A-N-E-S. "The fire
burns and the hall is warm,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.015
and outside it rains
and snows and storms.

00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:03.535
There comes a sparrow and

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.490
swiftly flies through the house."

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.925
The installation is not
great in these halls, right?

00:20:09.925 --> 00:20:14.680
"It comes through one door
and it goes out another.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.015
Low in the time in
which he is within,

00:20:19.015 --> 00:20:22.555
He has not touched
by the winter storm.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.640
But that time is the flash of

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.355
an eye and the least of times.

00:20:27.355 --> 00:20:32.200
He soon passes from winter
out to winter again.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.475
So is the life of man
revealed for a brief space.

00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:40.045
But what went before
and what follows after,

00:20:40.045 --> 00:20:41.890
we do not know.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.350
Therefore, if
this teaching can reveal

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.135
any more certain knowledge it

00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:49.270
seems only right we
should follow it."

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.725
Now this is not why people
necessarily converted,

00:20:53.725 --> 00:20:57.295
because not everybody's
really bothered by that.

00:20:57.295 --> 00:20:59.200
But most people figure,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.495
"Wow, I'm in the hall, it's warm.

00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:04.465
It's great. I'm having
such a good time."

00:21:04.465 --> 00:21:06.370
When I have to leave brief

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.935
though it will be
I'll deal with that.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:12.445
But, it does explain

00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:14.680
some of the appeal
of Christianity and

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:22.270
why the invaders who
were Pagan converted.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.050
Indeed why people tend to
convert to world religions like

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:31.375
Christianity and Islam to
this day, a local religion.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:35.875
I'm calling tribal only because
by that I mean confined

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:37.840
to a people whose identity

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.615
is caught up in their religion.

00:21:40.615 --> 00:21:43.870
A tribal people or
a tribal religion has trouble

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.020
surviving extensive contact
with other people.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.400
Because it's uniqueness is
threatened by the realization

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.500
that there's a huge world
out there of lots of

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.320
other people and when you
start interacting with them,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.330
that is when you're
no longer isolated,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.085
you will tend to seek

00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:09.415
an explanation for things
that is grander than just,

00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:11.260
this Gods protect my sphere.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.120
This God protects my heart.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.780
This God protects against
accidents in childbirth.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.550
There are exceptions.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.415
Judaism is one of
the most obvious.

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:26.980
Here is a religion of
a small group of people that

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.280
survives over the centuries.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.670
But it is not exactly

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.935
a tribal religion in
the sense that it's

00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:40.210
monotheistic and
historical sense is very strong.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.460
This is what the priest means,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.030
or this is what I mean in
interpreting the priests words

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.435
as reported by Bede,
by historical sense.

00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:52.284
A sense that God

00:22:52.284 --> 00:22:55.385
rules over the world
even if I'm not in it.

00:22:55.385 --> 00:22:57.900
That there is something to come,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.940
not necessarily that there is

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.515
an after-life although that

00:23:01.515 --> 00:23:03.810
obviously is part of
the teachings of Christianity,

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.250
but that there is
a purpose to life.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.700
So conversion.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:17.545
The conversion of Ireland
and England are different.

00:23:17.545 --> 00:23:21.084
The process of converting England

00:23:21.084 --> 00:23:24.565
begins in 597 with
a missionary known,

00:23:24.565 --> 00:23:26.665
unfortunately, his
named is Augustine.

00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:29.185
He's Augustine of Canterbury not

00:23:29.185 --> 00:23:31.885
Augustine of Hippo
The Confessions Augustine.

00:23:31.885 --> 00:23:37.030
He is sent by
the Roman Pope Gregory,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.865
the first Gregory the Great.

00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:45.985
Bede tells us that he was
motivated to do this,

00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:48.610
it's very strange thing
to do there had not

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.940
been missionaries sent
by the Pope before,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.955
that he was motivated
to do this by seeing

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:59.665
British boys for sale in
the slave market in Rome,

00:23:59.665 --> 00:24:01.780
and asking who they were?

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.060
He was told they were Angles,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.705
A-N. Angls as an
Angle-Saxon A-N-G-E-L-S,

00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:09.895
and he is reputed to have

00:24:09.895 --> 00:24:15.805
said we should make
them Angels not Angles.

00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:26.060
Angenly known Angle
or Angels not Angles.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:34.780
Whatever the story
Augustine arrived around

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.110
597 at an island that had

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.580
some remnants of
Celtic Christianity,

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:48.200
but is basically
a Pagan and barbarian.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.130
He landed in Cant in

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.300
the southeast corner of

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.685
the island closest
to the continent,

00:24:54.685 --> 00:24:58.660
and on this map what I'd like
you to know particularly

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.300
are Cant with Canterbury

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.430
as its capital in the south east,

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.770
Westx in the west,

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.155
I think I've
helpfully underlined,

00:25:08.155 --> 00:25:14.450
Mercia towards the center,
Northumbria northeast.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.265
The most important kingdoms
in England and

00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:21.340
Wickham has emphasized how
fragmented this territory was.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.890
The most important kingdoms
would be at different times

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.250
Northumbria, Mercia, and Westx.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.265
But the first place
to convert is Cant.

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:32.230
It faces the continent,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.660
the pagan ruler of Cant
had actually married

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.110
a Christian princess
from Merovingian Gaul.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.290
Augustine established
the first bishopric in

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.290
Cant at Canterbury which
would be henceforth,

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.875
the major ecclesiastical center

00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:50.870
of Britain it's Archbishop wreck.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.390
Bede tells us about this,

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.100
but he also tells
us a lot more about

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.220
Northumbria which
is where he lived.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.410
Here you can see the off

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.450
again on again pace
of conversion.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.350
The pious King Edwin who had

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.495
that council that
we just described,

00:26:09.495 --> 00:26:12.555
converted his people
after a vision,

00:26:12.555 --> 00:26:17.040
but after his death in 633
his successor went back to

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.795
the old traditional religion,
renouncing Christianity.

00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:24.300
Then the successor to that king,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.360
a man named Oswald,
re-established Christianity.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.050
But he was killed in battle by

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.570
the pagan king of Mercia in 642.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.350
Only in the 660s,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.140
670s is England pretty

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.445
definitively converted
to Christianity.

00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:52.725
We can see this kind
of transition

00:26:52.725 --> 00:26:57.270
in two of the most famous sources

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.085
of information about this world.

00:26:59.085 --> 00:27:02.400
The poem Beowulf,
how many people have read this?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.965
Yeah, everybody's read this
at one time or another.

00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:07.275
Beowulf does have

00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:10.950
some little Christian
themes and there is

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.945
some debate as to

00:27:12.945 --> 00:27:15.240
what extent the poem is to be

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.625
understood in Christian terms,

00:27:17.625 --> 00:27:20.115
but in its atmosphere,

00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:23.670
its rituals, the
burial and the ship,

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.289
the burning of the body,

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:27.540
the devotion not only to war

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.120
but to feasting and two gold,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.920
ring giving, it evokes,
not merely evokes.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.550
It is a description of

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.790
a warrior society in

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.450
which although it is
written in old English,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.170
remember that it actually
takes place in Denmark.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.200
This is a north
sea world in which

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.710
the communications patterns
are such that you could

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.100
write an English poem
about someone who

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.030
goes over to the mainland
for adventure.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.310
The other source is one of

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:13.200
the great archaeological
triumphs of the last 100 years,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.925
the so-called Sutton Hoo

00:28:14.925 --> 00:28:17.910
treasure which is in
the British Museum.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.695
In East Anglia
close to the water,

00:28:22.695 --> 00:28:24.630
actually close to the sea,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.160
a burial ship was found in 1939.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:37.620
Probably the king buried
here was Raedwald,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.150
a king of East Anglia,

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.980
who died in 627.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.020
Now it's a pagan burial because
of all the grave goods,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.580
all this stuff is in there
or so it would seem.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.460
But it's hard to tell
just as in Beowulf,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.960
is it pagan? Is it Christian?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.465
It's hard to tell about
this burial scene,

00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:06.735
because he's got a lot of stuff

00:29:06.735 --> 00:29:12.315
from what might be called
foreign gifts or maybe plunder.

00:29:12.315 --> 00:29:16.290
Foreign gifts. He's got
two Byzantine silver spoons.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.585
So two silver spoons made

00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:23.880
in Constantinople or [inaudible].

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.535
He's got gold coins.

00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:30.750
They're mostly from
the Merovingian kingdom

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.485
and they're different.
They're all different.

00:29:34.485 --> 00:29:37.470
This is not an economic thing.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.880
This is a treasure thing.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.560
The difference
between economy and

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.380
treasure is that treasure
is just for hoarding,

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.580
and economy is fluid
and transactional.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.290
The hoarding of course we see in

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.930
Beowulf most obviously
with the dragon.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.700
The dragon is not accumulating

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.500
the treasure in
order to safeguard

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:02.050
his retirement or
trade up in caves.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.160
He just sleeps on this treasure.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.590
The point of that is of
course that people accumulate

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.040
treasure for
non-economic reasons.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.380
For reasons that have to do with

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:20.150
their own satisfaction
or their own anxieties.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:26.195
The utility of treasure is
generally overestimated.

00:30:26.195 --> 00:30:28.640
Nevertheless of course
at the same time this is

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.800
a world in which gold,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.690
treasure accumulation
is what men do.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.335
So what else is at Sutton Hoo?

00:30:39.335 --> 00:30:41.640
A wonderful helmet,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:47.010
unique because these things
tend to disintegrate.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.270
A sword, a male

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:57.090
shirt and then all sorts
of paraphernalia.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.220
Some of it with Christian
symbols like crosses,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:05.980
some of it very much
in the pagan world.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.405
Beowulf and Sutton Hoo
go together.

00:31:09.405 --> 00:31:12.390
They both show us
a world of treasure,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:20.625
of weapons, of drinking halls,
of palaces, isolated.

00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:24.105
The drinking hall is important
as you know from Beowulf,

00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:27.870
it is the manifestation
of civilization.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.690
It is that protection
from outside that Bede

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.140
describes in the little
sparrow anecdote,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.670
but it is also the center
of government.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.965
We're back to the ruler and
his entourage or comatose,

00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:46.290
his gang, if you want to

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.410
put a more cynical
coloration on it.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.765
So the conversion of England

00:31:57.765 --> 00:32:00.870
is completed by
the late seventh century,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.020
but it is a more
complicated story

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.510
than just monolithic
Christianity versus

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.240
monolithic paganism because
there are two kinds of

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.020
Christianity that seek
to convert England.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.950
One from Ireland
and one from Rome.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.835
Ireland, let's just
pause over Ireland.

00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:26.910
Never part of the Roman
Empire, as I said,

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.735
but it's also the first
place outside

00:32:30.735 --> 00:32:34.440
the Roman world to have been
converted to Christianity.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.790
The first place in
Europe actually.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.700
The first place period
is Ethiopia.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.995
Ethiopia of course in

00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:43.320
northeastern Africa would be

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.230
converted to
Christianity very early,

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.635
fourth century AD probably,

00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:54.790
but within Europe, Ireland was
converted to Christianity.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:05.425
By the British or English
missionary, St. Patrick,

00:33:05.425 --> 00:33:10.195
this is a little
embarrassing but in fact,

00:33:10.195 --> 00:33:13.960
the Apostle to Ireland is one of

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.525
those British Celtic Roman

00:33:16.525 --> 00:33:20.080
fourth century figures, Patrick.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.870
So in 600 AD,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.059
Ireland was largely Catholic

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:28.520
while England was mostly pagan.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:34.875
Irish Christianity had
certain peculiarities,

00:33:34.875 --> 00:33:37.860
some of them related to
its lack of a Roman past.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.750
Thus, for example,
it did not have

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.335
bishops really or
the bishops were weak.

00:33:42.335 --> 00:33:44.350
Because there had
not been cities in

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.945
Ireland on the Roman model.

00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:48.925
Therefore Christianity
didn't have

00:33:48.925 --> 00:33:51.190
an urban background but rather

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.800
a very decentralized
and rural background.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.990
The most powerful institutions

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.750
in Ireland were monasteries.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.900
Because these were
great rural centers

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.545
and so the monks ruled over
the bishops generally.

00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:11.050
Irish monasticism
was very austere.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.520
The Irish monks were

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.490
more ascetic than
the monks we'll be meeting

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:16.975
next week from

00:34:16.975 --> 00:34:21.250
the Benedictine tradition
started in Italy.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:26.540
They also were less
fixed in one place.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.900
In Benedictine monasticism,
you're not supposed to move,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.010
you're supposed to be stable,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.160
you're supposed to go through
the same routine everyday.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.780
The Irish favored
a more wandering existence and

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.180
the establishment of
little communities

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.865
or colonies far away.

00:34:45.865 --> 00:34:50.080
The Irish form of piety
emphasizes exile.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.630
It might be exile to

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:58.270
a scary and almost unimaginable
kind of environment.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.530
There are, for example,

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.005
lots of little islands in

00:35:02.005 --> 00:35:07.225
the Irish sea that seemed
to be uninhabitable.

00:35:07.225 --> 00:35:10.885
That is, if you look at
them from the tour boat,

00:35:10.885 --> 00:35:14.920
you see a lot of birds and
it's birders paradise.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.740
But in the middle of July,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.370
it's overcast, raining
and the sea is pounding.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.645
Then you notice, there are
little remnants of houses.

00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:33.430
Yeah. Question? Little caves

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.370
where people in
the sixth and seventh century

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:40.045
lived or the island is tiny,

00:35:40.045 --> 00:35:42.175
smaller than this building.

00:35:42.175 --> 00:35:44.560
It looks like 20 people
were living there.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.795
What are they living on?

00:35:46.795 --> 00:35:49.600
Well, poultry I guess.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.720
But this is a very severe
form of asceticism.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.855
The wandering also can mean,

00:35:58.855 --> 00:36:01.435
just holding up on some island

00:36:01.435 --> 00:36:03.610
or wandering around

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.490
the European continent
and converting people.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.640
The Irish were
great missionaries both to

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.310
England and to the continent

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.215
and we'll be talking
about that some more.

00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:18.760
What about the Irish as
the saviors of civilization?

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.440
A book published about eight,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.935
nine years ago, How
the Irish Saved Civilization,

00:36:23.935 --> 00:36:27.205
is like most such popular books,

00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:31.000
kind of overdone
and reductionist.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.625
It's not literally exactly true.

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:36.355
But here again, as with England,

00:36:36.355 --> 00:36:41.020
we have a society that had
no Roman influence and yet

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.870
had a highly developed tradition

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.450
of learning,
preservation of Latin.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.370
In part, very good
knowledge of Latin

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.455
because they didn't
think they spoke it.

00:36:50.455 --> 00:36:53.290
Remember, we said the people
in the former Roman Empire,

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.490
it's hard to date the point
at which someone in Spain is

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.530
no longer speaking Latin
but is speaking something

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.095
that we can start
to call Spanish.

00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:04.735
In Ireland, the distinction
was quite clear.

00:37:04.735 --> 00:37:07.480
You had to learn
Latin in lessons.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.575
You had to go to class.

00:37:08.575 --> 00:37:10.270
You had to be taught Latin.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.775
So the Latin that was
taught was bookish.

00:37:12.775 --> 00:37:18.650
But for that, in
many respects, correct.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.545
Finally, the Irish celebrated

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:30.100
Easter according to
a different calendar.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.615
So we refer to the Irish
or the Celtic church.

00:37:34.615 --> 00:37:37.750
We mean this more
decentralized church.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:42.590
The somewhat more wandering,
missionary church.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.800
A church that was
less hierarchical and

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.885
less organized around bishops

00:37:49.885 --> 00:37:52.420
than that of its rival Rome.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.030
The story of the seventh
century in England

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.565
is therefore partly the story of

00:37:57.565 --> 00:37:59.710
competition between paganism and

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.840
Christianity and
flip-flopping between

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.655
them and competition between

00:38:03.655 --> 00:38:06.640
Irish Christianity
represented by,

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.095
for example, the Monastery of

00:38:08.095 --> 00:38:12.985
Iona in what's now
Scotland, I-O-N-A.

00:38:12.985 --> 00:38:16.480
The missions of St.
Aidan, A-I-D-A-N,

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.640
whom Bede describes
with great sympathy

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.475
even though he doesn't
agree with him.

00:38:21.475 --> 00:38:26.350
But the controversy really
centered ultimately or at

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:32.200
least in an immediate
sense over Easter.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.770
At the Senate of Whitby in 664,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.820
it was decided to embrace

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.725
the Roman calculation of Easter.

00:38:50.725 --> 00:38:54.460
With that, bishops, hierarchy,

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.010
a more organized church.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.750
I have a lot of trouble with

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.580
this Easter problem and
you will have noticed

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.780
that I've evaded telling you

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.090
exactly what
the calculations are.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.790
Some of you may know
much better than me.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:12.190
But the Jewish Passover is
established by lunar months.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.470
Christians wanted to break with

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.555
Jewish tradition and celebrating

00:39:16.555 --> 00:39:20.905
Easter according to
a somewhat different calendar.

00:39:20.905 --> 00:39:24.820
So it combined lunar and
solar methods of calculation.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.330
Very complex operation therefore.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.355
In the year 455,

00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:32.275
Rome, that is to say the papacy,

00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:34.810
under our friend Leo the first,

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.479
mission to the Huns,

00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:41.035
definition of
the two natures of Christ.

00:39:41.035 --> 00:39:43.585
Leo the first and Rome opted for

00:39:43.585 --> 00:39:47.185
a 19-year cycle of
calculating Easter.

00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:50.455
But the Celtic churches cut
off from the continent,

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.620
remember we're in this post

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.560
Roman world of
very little contact,

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.545
kept an 84-year cycle.

00:39:59.545 --> 00:40:01.885
So in the seventh century

00:40:01.885 --> 00:40:05.230
when the Roman missionaries
had arrived again,

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.370
you have two conflicting dates
for Easter every year.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.440
I mean, occasionally just as with

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.380
the Orthodox and Catholic
Easters, they come together.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.660
So every so often they will
actually be the same Sunday,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.980
but generally
speaking, different.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.570
So you get these ludicrous scenes

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.255
like King Oswiu of Northumbria

00:40:22.255 --> 00:40:24.745
celebrating Easter according to

00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:28.165
the Celtic tradition
and his wife,

00:40:28.165 --> 00:40:29.830
who was from Kent,

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.220
celebrated it according
to the Roman tradition.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.260
So one Sunday was

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.560
Celtic Easter and then the
next Sunday was Roman Easter.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.865
So it's not so much
that Easter is

00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:44.650
so important
intrinsically but it is

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.690
a symbol of the embrace of

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.920
the Roman form of
Christianity and the bringing

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.710
of England into
an orientation more towards

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.370
the continent than
towards the Celtic west.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.690
What is amazing,
as I said before,

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.600
is how quickly once the
conversion takes place,

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.890
England becomes not only

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.750
integrated into the continent but

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:12.050
a place of great
cultural accomplishment.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.790
The great archbishop
of Canterbury of

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.190
this post Whitby era,

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.400
Theodore, Archbishop
of Canterbury,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.630
669 to 690, established
bishoprics,

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:32.510
monasteries and endowed
them with books.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.620
Theodore is an
interesting character.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.910
He is actually from Syria.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.240
How somebody from Syria becomes
Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.280
something that would
be very unlikely now,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.200
in the seventh century AD
is an aspect of

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.020
some preservation
of the outlines of

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.670
the cosmopolitan Roman world

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.500
that we began the course with.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.710
There are a lot of
Syrian Popes at this time too.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:04.010
Syrian and Greek popes from
the Eastern Mediterranean.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:11.695
The first manuscript we have

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:14.800
of the Bible as a single
manuscript, in other words,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.160
where all of the books of
the Bible are contained in

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.285
the same volume is from
this place and this era,

00:42:22.285 --> 00:42:25.850
the so-called Codex Amiatinus.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:40.300
A magnificently decorated Bible,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.845
sent to the Pope in 716,

00:42:44.845 --> 00:42:48.985
written at Bede's
monastery of Jarrow.

00:42:48.985 --> 00:42:56.020
Now in Florence, at
Lorentzian library of Florence.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.370
It is decorated in

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.445
this very distinctive style
that you all know,

00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:05.560
if not from courses,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.210
from Christmas cards and stuff.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.855
The Book of Kells is
the most famous example of this.

00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:12.160
This is the so-called

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.780
insular style because
it's shared by

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.320
both Celtic Ireland and
Anglo-Saxon England.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.065
Lots of intricate curlicues,
complicated animals,

00:43:23.065 --> 00:43:26.530
magnificent contrast of color,

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.430
a kind of abstraction when
you first look at it.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:32.320
It looks like an oriental carpet.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.690
But in fact, if you look at
it a little more closely,

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.310
you can see that all sorts of

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:40.870
little intertwined animals or

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:45.740
fantastic shapes and
colors within it.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.870
Questions? Problems?
We could spend

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:57.805
an entire semester on England
but I think we've had

00:43:57.805 --> 00:43:59.530
at least a taste of

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.220
its significance both
in its own right and

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.625
as one more and rather
different aspect

00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:10.000
of the post Roman world that
we've been occupied with.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.920
I'll see you for
the exam on Monday.

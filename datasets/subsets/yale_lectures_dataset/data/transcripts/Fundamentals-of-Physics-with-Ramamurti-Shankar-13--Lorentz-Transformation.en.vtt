00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.904
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So,

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:08.282
what did we do the last time?
Here is what we were talking

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.065
about.
We were trying to describe an

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:18.803
event as seen by two observers.
One will be called S and

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:22.820
here is the x axis for
S;

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.750
the other is called S
prime.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.120
S prime is sliding to
the right at velocity u.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.893
Therefore, at a certain
time--Let me say S is me

00:00:32.893 --> 00:00:35.984
and S prime is you.
When you pass me,

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:39.920
I'm sitting at the origin of my
coordinates, x = 0.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.121
You're at the origin of your
moving coordinates,

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:47.003
x prime = 0,
and when we crossed each other,

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.000
that time we set as 0 in our
own clocks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.413
We synchronized them so that
the event, x = 0,

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:59.682
t = 0,
also had coordinate x

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:04.680
prime = 0,
t prime = 0.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.809
When you and I crossed,
we pushed our stopwatches,

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:10.938
we synchronized our clocks,
our origins coincided,

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:15.248
and that's when it began.
So, after some time,

00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:18.717
you are here.
This is your frame and this is

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:22.159
my frame.
If something happens here,

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.413
something could be anything.
I hope you understand what an

00:01:28.413 --> 00:01:30.386
event is.
That's not a relativistic

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:32.110
notion.
That's the very old notion.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.580
Something happens at some place;
firecracker goes off.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.860
I ask you, "When did it happen?"
and "Where did it happen?"

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
and you are given the
coordinates.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.099
So, everything that happens is
an event.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.284
You saw Elvis,
I say, "Where did you see

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:50.410
Elvis?"
At the supermarket.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.540
Okay.
When did you see Elvis?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.956
I would also ask you what you
were smoking because this third

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:01.225
question, that's not an extra
coordinate but in this case I

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.607
would like,
well, I should tell you beyond

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:07.720
all the laughter that's a
serious issue.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.561
Why is that not a coordinate?
Why not ask more and more

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:12.680
questions and call them all
coordinates?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.009
The reason the other things are
not coordinates is very

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.055
important.
Why is time now suddenly a

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.581
coordinate?
Well, as you could have always

00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:23.870
asked 100 years ago when did
something happen,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.988
and the reason is that you will
see in the new relativistic

00:02:28.988 --> 00:02:33.060
physics, x and t,
according to one person,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.816
get mixed up into x
prime and t prime of the

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:38.435
other person.
The fact that space and time

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:42.191
coordinates can be combined to
give the new space and time

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:45.420
coordinates is why it‘s called
a coordinate.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.052
I'll say more about it later.
Now, by the way,

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:52.904
I've posted some notes on this
topic for those of you who want

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:57.182
to have a second pass at it.
I also don't know how much the

00:02:57.182 --> 00:03:00.686
textbook covers this topic
because I spend a lot of time on

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:04.009
this topic, not in proportion to
what's in the book.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.259
So, you can look at those notes
which are posted today.

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.305
Before all the Einstein stuff,
if something occurred here,

00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:14.924
you would say it's at a
distance x prime from

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:17.638
your origin.
I will say it's at a distance

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:20.929
x from my origin.
This difference between our

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:25.635
origins would be ut.
Therefore, before Einstein,

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:31.647
I would say x prime is
x - ut and you would say

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:36.657
x should be what you
think is a coordinate +

00:03:36.657 --> 00:03:38.160
ut.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.659
This is just going back and
forth from you to me and you can

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.479
already notice that to go back
and forth from you to me,

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.238
we just change the sign of the
velocity, because I'm going to

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.261
the right and you're going to
the left [Note:

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:55.000
Left and right mixed up here.].
That's why the formulas have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.300
sign of u reversed.
What is the big change after

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.370
Einstein?
First is, I admit,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.426
the possibility that maybe you
will think the time elapsed

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:08.979
since we synchronized our clocks
is not necessarily the same.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.292
I leave that option open that
t and t prime are

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.887
not the same.
Second thing I do is--I have

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:18.738
already explained to you that
the velocity of light coming out

00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:22.399
the same for different people is
very counterintuitive,

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.227
because if you are going to the
right, I expect you to get a

00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:27.480
smaller speed and yet to get the
same answer.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.223
So, we know that it's because
we don't agree anymore on clocks

00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:34.486
and meter sticks being the same.
So in particular,

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:37.323
you will say,
"I don't buy your prediction

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:41.129
that I expect to get the answer
to be x - ut.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.595
I'm going to put a fudge
factor, gamma,

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.710
which depends on the velocity
between you and me,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.629
because your lengths are not my
lengths."

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.495
Likewise, I will tell you,
"I don't agree with your

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:55.646
expectation that I should get
x prime + ut

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.899
prime.
I don't believe your lengths

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.959
are really my lengths,
but I'm going to put the same

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.399
fudge factor,
gamma."

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.889
This is a very interesting
result.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.735
If I think your meter sticks
are short so that I want to blow

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:13.088
up the answer with some amount;
you are allowed to say the same

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:15.256
about me.
It's one of the big paradoxes

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:18.101
in relativity that we can accuse
each other of using meter

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.379
sticks,
which are short,

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.399
and we'll go into a little bit
more how that's even possible.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:26.292
But the postulates tell us that
if my fudge factor is gamma,

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.800
yours should also be the same
gamma.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.423
So, gamma is what we don't know.
I showed you a trick to find

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:36.027
gamma.
I said, let's imagine that this

00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:38.985
event here, which could've been
a firecracker,

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:42.929
is triggered by a light pulse
that was emitted when you and I

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.114
met here.
The light pulse goes racing and

00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:49.448
sets off an explosion here.
That's the event we are talking

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:51.870
about.
That's not a generic event.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.035
It's a particular event in
which x has to be

00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:58.960
c times t because
that's the equation for a light

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.093
pulse, according to me.
Light goes at the velocity of

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:07.188
c, and the event has got
the same velocity,

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:10.707
according to you.
This event here should be

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:14.993
connected by a light pulse that
for x/t is c,

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:19.279
and x prime/t
prime is the same c.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.925
Then, I said,
take these three equations,

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:25.430
multiply the left-hand side by
the right-hand side,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.032
put in these numbers and
extract gamma,

00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:31.730
and I will not repeat that
part, and gamma was this.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.928
Once you've got this,
you can take this gamma and put

00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:42.370
it back here.
Let's see what we get.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.570
So I'm going to put what we get
here into this board.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.250
You guys got all of that?
Okay.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.204
So, I'm going to put it back
here, because this is just

00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:57.396
background from last lecture.
What we have then is x

00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:04.389
prime = x - ut divided by
this famous square root,

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.500
and if you go and solve for
t prime in the other

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.230
equation, it's a simple
algebraic manipulation,

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.000
so I don't want to waste my
time doing that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.838
You will find t prime
= t - ux/c^(2) divided by

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.460
the same square root.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.332
These are priceless.
This is really all of

00:07:30.332 --> 00:07:33.854
relativity, all the funny stuff
you hear about E =

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:36.970
Mc^(2), funny clocks,
the Twin Paradox.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.060
Everything comes from this
equation.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.597
And you people should be very
pleased that within,

00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:45.629
what, six weeks of starting
Physics 200,

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:49.591
you have all the things you
need to understand these

00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:53.319
equations, to understand where
they came from.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:56.990
That's also the remarkable
thing about relativity.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.560
A lot of the modern things in
physics require a lot of

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.832
mathematics.
In fact, if you want to take a

00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:04.963
beam and you want to load it
with weight and you want to see

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:08.019
the stresses and strains,
the math in all that is 1,000

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:11.319
times more difficult than this
one, and yet the mathematics of

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:13.133
relativity is very,
very simple,

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:16.045
and accessible to all of you,
and there is nothing that I

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:18.800
know of that you don't know as
far as how to get these

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.750
equations.
This is what you do.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.404
Everything follows from taking
these equations and analyzing

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:27.501
them, extracting the
consequences and that's really

00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.155
more an issue of courage than
just intelligence because once

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:34.683
you've got these equations,
you will have to take them,

00:08:34.683 --> 00:08:37.320
you'll have to follow them
where they take you.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.926
That's what we're going to do.
The rest of the whole remaining

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:42.330
lecture, it's all about getting
information from these

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.967
equations.
Now, some of you are not used

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:47.293
to writing equations.
I've noticed,

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.567
when you see something like
this, it's not clear what is

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:53.261
being stated.
So, let me remind you one more

00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:55.750
time.
u is a fixed number.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.860
That's your speed relative to
mine.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.322
I see something happening,
I give it a pair of numbers,

00:09:02.322 --> 00:09:05.379
xt, you give the same
event,

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.368
another pair of numbers,
x prime,

00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:09.072
t prime,
and this is how they are

00:09:09.072 --> 00:09:11.332
related.
So, I gave you an analogy,

00:09:11.332 --> 00:09:15.362
but let me repeat the analogy.
If you're now talking about the

00:09:15.362 --> 00:09:18.412
xy plane rather than the
xt plane,

00:09:18.412 --> 00:09:21.961
that guard is not an event.
That guard is a coordinate of a

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.080
point, maybe where something is
sitting.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.899
I give to it a pair of numbers,
x and y.

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:31.693
Now, you have a different
coordinate system,

00:09:31.693 --> 00:09:36.279
rotated relative to mine,
by some angle θ.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:39.378
To that same point,
same location,

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:45.011
you measure x prime up
to here and t prime from

00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:49.850
there.
I'm sorry, x prime and

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:55.632
y prime are measured
along your axis,

00:09:55.632 --> 00:10:03.164
and the formula there is
x prime = x cos θ + y

00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:12.039
sin θ and y prime is
-x sin θ + y cos θ.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:15.070
θ is the analog of the
velocity now.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.750
If θ is 0,
you and I agree completely.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.610
If θ is not 0,
your axis is rotated relative

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.850
to mine, and the same point has
two different numbers,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.348
xy for me,
x prime/y prime

00:10:28.348 --> 00:10:31.009
for you, and the relation
between them is this.

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:33.584
So, you plug in my x and
y, you can get your

00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:35.210
x prime and y
prime.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.898
Let me give a concrete example.
Let's take θ to

00:10:40.898 --> 00:10:44.348
π/4 or 45°.
Then, as you know,

00:10:44.348 --> 00:10:47.590
at 45, sine and cosine,
they're all the same.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.992
One over root 2.
So, in that case,

00:10:50.992 --> 00:10:56.993
x prime is x over
root 2 + y over root 2,

00:10:56.993 --> 00:11:03.191
and y prime is -x
over root 2 + y over root

00:11:03.191 --> 00:11:03.880
2.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.669
That's a special case when
θ is 45°.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:15.771
So, for every angle,
cosine and sine will reduce to

00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:18.997
usual simple numbers that happen
to be the [one over]

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:21.834
square root of 2 here.
Then, it tells you my x

00:11:21.834 --> 00:11:24.243
and y are related to your
x prime and y

00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:26.080
prime in this manner,
and you can test it.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.682
For example,
take a point with coordinates

00:11:30.682 --> 00:11:33.559
(1,1).
(x,y) is 1,1.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:39.707
If (x,y) is (1,1),
and my axis is related to yours

00:11:39.707 --> 00:11:45.341
by 45°, (1,1) lies right there.
So, what I expect is your

00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:48.991
y prime, there's
no y prime,

00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:53.250
and the coordinate should be
entirely x prime.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.810
If I put in (1,1) and indeed
you find if I put x = y =

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.439
1, y prime becomes 0.
And how about x

00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:05.990
prime? It becomes 1+1
over root 2;

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:13.049
that means 2 over root 2 is the
square root of 2.

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:16.429
The square root of 2,
of course, would be the lengthy

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:20.200
measure this way because the
length of the vector is square

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.103
root of 2,
and the vector is entirely

00:12:22.103 --> 00:12:25.370
along the x direction.
So, the length you will get for

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.480
this coordinate will be root 2.
So, come back to these

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.080
equations.
They're the same thing.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.980
If you want,
I can write x prime as

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.402
x divided by this number
- u divided by this

00:12:39.402 --> 00:12:42.827
number times t.
So, you can think of 1 over

00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:46.243
this number here as the analog
of cos θ and

00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:49.299
u over this number as the
analog of sine.

00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:52.816
So, it's just that instead of
cosine and sine all being

00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:56.593
upstairs, some of the numbers
are down, some of the numbers

00:12:56.593 --> 00:12:58.763
are up.
But for a given u,

00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:01.960
these are also numbers constant
depending on u,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.200
and x prime is the
linear combination of x

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.789
and t,
and t prime is some

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:07.990
other linear combination of
x and t.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.809
But I should warn you that it
is not an ordinary rotation.

00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:14.988
In other words,
you cannot treat this as a

00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:19.199
cosine and that as a sine.
They're not cosine or sine of

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.488
anything, because if they were,
this squared plus that squared

00:13:23.488 --> 00:13:26.160
should add up to 1,
and they won't.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.794
So, don't even try that.
This is not an ordinary

00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:31.629
rotation but it is still what
you can call a linear

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:34.578
transformation.
Linear transformation means the

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:38.560
new numbers are related to the
first powers of the old numbers.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.851
They are linear.
They don't involve t^(2)

00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:44.029
and x^(2).
Okay, so that is the content of

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:48.176
the Lorentz transformation.
Everybody should understand

00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:51.370
what they do by way of going
back and forth.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.777
But now, you can go backwards.
You can say,

00:13:53.777 --> 00:13:57.766
"Well, how do I write x
in terms of x prime and

00:13:57.766 --> 00:14:02.201
t prime?"
There are two options open for

00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.537
you.
One is, these are simultaneous

00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:06.628
equations.
You've got to find a way to

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:09.855
solve for x and t
in terms of x prime and

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:12.659
t prime and all these
funny functions involving

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.138
u.
You treat them all as constants

00:14:15.138 --> 00:14:17.380
and juggle them around,
multiply by this,

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.759
divide by that,
but you shouldn't do that

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:22.169
because you know what the answer
should be.

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:26.133
The answer should be the same
as what I got with the velocity

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.744
reversed.
So, x should be x

00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:31.419
prime + ut prime or the
square root.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:34.167
If I write the square root,
it means I don't feel like

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.274
putting what's in it.
It's the same old thing,

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:37.570
so you got tired of writing
that.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.896
t prime will be t +
ux over c^(2) divided

00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:46.824
by the square root.
So, one should be able to go

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:50.039
back and forth,
just like in this formula.

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:52.792
If you like,
I gave it to you as an example

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:57.061
long back as a homework problem.
You can write a new formula

00:14:57.061 --> 00:15:01.295
that says x = x prime
cos θ - y sin θ and

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:04.320
y prime is equal to
something.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.761
I mean, y is equal to
something something,

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:09.712
and the way to get that is to
either solve the equations or

00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:12.509
realize that if I go from me to
you by a θ,

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:15.703
I go from you to me by -θ,
and all you have to do is

00:15:15.703 --> 00:15:19.265
change sin θ to -sin
θ and leave the cos

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:21.077
θ alone.
Similarly here,

00:15:21.077 --> 00:15:23.839
you change the sign of the
velocity u to get the

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:28.312
reverse transformations.
Okay, so that is the Lorentz

00:15:28.312 --> 00:15:31.649
transformation.
Now, we are going to start

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:34.444
milking the transformation.
Everything is going to be

00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:36.300
applying it to understand
various things.

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:43.209
The first step in getting the
mileage out of the Lorentz

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:46.179
transformation is,
take a pair of events.

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:49.594
I urge you, whenever you get a
problem with relativity,

00:15:49.594 --> 00:15:53.388
to think in terms of events and
quite often think in terms of

00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:55.700
pair of events.
Two events.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.956
So, event one is,
let me give concrete events,

00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:03.225
and most of the relativistic
examples involve some degree of

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:06.410
violence and so this one
involves a gun.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.063
So, I take this gun.
I'm not going to point it at

00:16:10.063 --> 00:16:12.270
any of you guys.
I fire the gun.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.700
That's event 1.
The bullet hits the wall;

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.603
that's event 2.
You can take two events

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:23.159
connected by a bullet leaving me
and hitting the wall,

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:26.648
or you can take two events not
connected to anything,

00:16:26.648 --> 00:16:29.117
okay.
You can take two unrelated

00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:30.600
events.
It doesn't matter.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.830
We're going to call them event
1 and event 2.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.181
So, event 1 will have
coordinate x_1,

00:16:37.181 --> 00:16:39.580
t_1,
right?

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.406
And according to you,
x_1 prime,

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:44.084
t_1 prime.
So, write the Lorentz

00:16:44.084 --> 00:16:48.057
transformation that first
relates x_1

00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:52.105
prime is x_1 -
ut_1 over the

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:54.769
square root.
Then right here,

00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:58.851
t_1 prime is
t_1ux

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:04.150
_1 or c^(2)
divided by a square root.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.087
Similarly, take the second
event and write the law for

00:17:09.087 --> 00:17:11.087
that.
Well, it's the same thing with

00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:15.007
the new numbers in it.
So, t_2 prime

00:17:15.007 --> 00:17:20.108
is equal to t_2 -
ux_2 over

00:17:20.108 --> 00:17:25.210
c^(2) divided by a square
root. Now,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.605
take the difference of 2 - 1.
You can take 1 - 2 but it's

00:17:30.605 --> 00:17:34.134
very common to define the
difference to be 2 - 1,

00:17:34.134 --> 00:17:37.369
and call it
Δx_2 prime.

00:17:37.369 --> 00:17:41.206
Δx prime is
x_2 prime

00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:45.400
- x_1 prime.
All the Δs will be

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.693
defined to be 2nd – the 1st.
I'm telling you to take

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.393
x_1 prime,
subtract it from

00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:55.097
x_2 prime on
the left-hand side and call it

00:17:55.097 --> 00:17:58.363
Δ of x prime.
Δ of x prime is the

00:17:58.363 --> 00:18:01.630
difference in the spatial
coordinates of the two events

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.037
according to you.
If you come to the right-hand

00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:06.473
side, now this is something you
guys should be able to do in

00:18:06.473 --> 00:18:09.332
your head.
I want to subtract that from

00:18:09.332 --> 00:18:10.925
that.
They share the same

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:13.810
denominator, so let me put the
denominator there.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.812
In the numerator you will get
x_2 -

00:18:19.812 --> 00:18:22.435
x_1,
which in my convention I will

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.840
call it Δx and the other
one will be uΔt.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.279
What this tells you is that
differences in coordinates also

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:37.049
obey the same Lorentz
transformation.

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:39.600
Instead of saying the
coordinate of an event was x,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
t and you get x
prime,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.797
t prime from the Lorentz
transformation,

00:18:43.797 --> 00:18:47.046
if you take a pair of events
and they are separated in space

00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:50.349
by Δx and in time by
Δt according to me,

00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:54.031
the separation according to
you, your Δx primes and

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:57.903
Δt primes are given by
similar formulas as the Lorentz

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:00.520
transformation;
put a Δ everywhere.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.906
This just came from taking the
difference of two equations

00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:10.800
applied to the two separate
events.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.727
All right.
You can also do this backwards,

00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:21.875
if you like.
If you want the differences

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:24.166
that I get in terms of yours and
yours in terms of mine,

00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:26.000
you have to reverse the sign of
u.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.740
So, I won't do that again.
Yep?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:36.200
Student:
Shouldn't that be t?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.130
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.659
Student: Yes.
Professor Ramamurti

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:43.861
Shankar: This was the
formula for x in terms of

00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:45.289
x prime and t
prime,

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:48.240
and t prime in terms of
t and x.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.703
Student:
[inaudible]

00:19:53.703 --> 00:20:02.740
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.571
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:04.299
I've got to give it some
numbers.

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:06.365
This is a,
this is b,

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:08.450
this is c.
Where is the problem?

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:14.234
One of you [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:18.310
Shankar: Oh,
yes yes yes.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.650
Of course.
Yes.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.537
Thank you.
Okay, now a public apology is

00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:24.620
forthcoming.
You wanted me to do this.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.907
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ramamurti

00:20:27.907 --> 00:20:31.799
Shankar: Yes?
Thank you very much.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:35.710
Okay, do not hesitate to do
this, okay?

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.512
In fact, when I said I don't
know anymore than you do about

00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:43.250
this, it looks like I know less
than you do about this.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.070
So, the fact that I know this
doesn't mean I'm going to get it

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.991
right.
So, all of you who screwed up

00:20:47.991 --> 00:20:50.559
in the Midterm,
remember there is hope for you.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:53.439
Maybe you won't do well as
students but you can become a

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:56.563
professor here.
Apparently, it's all right for

00:20:56.563 --> 00:20:59.220
us to get things wrong.
That's correct.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.361
Very good.
Okay, so if you're following me

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:06.816
that well, I'm very happy now to
know you must be following what

00:21:06.816 --> 00:21:10.023
I'm saying here.
So now, let us--Everything now

00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:13.314
I keep telling you I'm building
it up in a big way but

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:16.917
everything really is going to
come from this version of the

00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:19.650
Lorentz transformation for
differences.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:23.452
Look, suppose you were smart
enough like Einstein and you did

00:21:23.452 --> 00:21:27.050
use these equations for gamma.
What do you do next?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.948
You write them down.
You can publish them and say

00:21:29.948 --> 00:21:31.962
according to me,
this is a rule for

00:21:31.962 --> 00:21:34.509
transformation,
but you cannot stop now.

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:38.687
You have to say what are the
implications of my equations

00:21:38.687 --> 00:21:43.088
because these equations are
dramatic variations of Newtonian

00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:44.850
laws.
For example,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.482
let us do one thing.
Two events are separated by 10

00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:51.288
meters according to me.
Δx prime,

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:56.160
if Δx is 10 meters,
then Δx prime is not 10

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.476
meters.
It is 10 minus something

00:21:58.476 --> 00:22:01.706
divided by something.
So, that distance between two

00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:04.798
events is changing.
That's not supposed to happen

00:22:04.798 --> 00:22:06.970
just because you get into a
train.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.124
Right?
If I hold my hands up and say I

00:22:10.124 --> 00:22:12.535
caught a fish that big,
that distance should be the

00:22:12.535 --> 00:22:15.380
same for me and the train or if
you look at me riding in the

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.660
train from outside the train you
should find the same distance.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.653
We're saying it's not true.
Likewise, if I say two events

00:22:21.653 --> 00:22:25.328
took place when I came to Yale,
I'm certain there I got a

00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:28.838
degree four years later,
that's supposed to be true for

00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:31.299
anybody.
But that's also not true.

00:22:31.299 --> 00:22:34.796
If Δt is four years,
Δx is whatever you

00:22:34.796 --> 00:22:36.897
like.
Maybe you never left New Haven,

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:38.824
so Δx is 0.
That's four years,

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:41.435
that's not four years.
These are all drastic

00:22:41.435 --> 00:22:45.450
consequences and we've got to
explore the consequences.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.406
The first thing I'm going to do
is to make sure that the

00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:53.651
velocity transformations from
one frame to other will be the

00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:58.340
requirements we set on it.
So, here's what I'm going to do.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.430
Event 1: I fired the gun.
Okay.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:07.430
Let me just call it Event 1,
I fire the gun.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.740
Event 2: a bullet hits the wall.

00:23:17.569 --> 00:23:20.486
So, the separation between
these two events is Δx

00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:23.349
for me and the time it took the
bullet is Δt.

00:23:23.349 --> 00:23:26.162
You can also see the bullet
from your train and you think

00:23:26.162 --> 00:23:29.226
the distance between me and the
wall is something and the time

00:23:29.226 --> 00:23:32.339
between the firing and hitting
the wall is something else.

00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:36.220
What's the velocity of the
bullet according to you and me?

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:47.357
v velocity of bullet,
for me, would be

00:23:47.357 --> 00:23:52.889
Δx/Δt.
Okay, now I should be a little

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:55.941
more careful with my rotation.
Usually Δ is used for

00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:59.197
infinitesimal numbers,
especially when you're going to

00:23:59.197 --> 00:24:02.410
define the velocity,
velocity is the limit of these

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.922
guys going to 0.
But it is the property of

00:24:04.922 --> 00:24:08.025
Lorentz transformation that at
this level, when I say

00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:10.890
differences in time and
differences in space,

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.980
they are not necessarily small.
Nowhere was I assuming that the

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.012
difference in x was a
small or the difference in

00:24:18.012 --> 00:24:20.089
[inaudible]
was small [inaudible].

00:24:20.089 --> 00:24:22.408
They could be events separated
by five light years,

00:24:22.408 --> 00:24:24.611
you could still use them.
But at this stage,

00:24:24.611 --> 00:24:27.150
don't think Δx has to
be infinitesimal.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.200
It is simply a shorthand for
difference.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.982
If I had all the time in the
world, I would write everything

00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:33.821
as x_2 -
x_1,

00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:35.849
but I'm using Δ as a
shorthand.

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:38.201
But when I'm going to find the
velocity of a bullet,

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:40.460
which could even be the
instantaneous velocity,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.412
then, here I do want to take
the limit in which they go to 0

00:24:45.412 --> 00:24:49.043
so it becomes dx/dt .
So, from now on,

00:24:49.043 --> 00:24:52.938
for this purpose of velocity
calculation, you should take

00:24:52.938 --> 00:24:55.860
them to be infinitesimal and
approaching 0,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.583
but not in general.
These equations are valid but

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:02.769
arbitrarily big intervals in
time and space.

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:06.710
Now, w better be the
velocity for you.

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:12.210
That is, I am S and you
are S prime.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.172
w is Δx prime
over Δt prime with

00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:16.160
suitable limits.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.770
Well, from these
transformational laws,

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.355
you can get them because here
is Δx prime and here is

00:25:25.355 --> 00:25:31.009
Δt prime.
Let me divide this by this on

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:36.470
the left-hand side to get
w.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.039
When I write Δx prime
over Δt prime,

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.680
you guys take the limits of
everything going to 0.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.127
I don't feel like writing that.
In fact, it's true even without

00:25:47.127 --> 00:25:51.118
the limit, but let's apply it in
the end to an instantaneous

00:25:51.118 --> 00:25:53.621
velocity.
What happens on the right-hand

00:25:53.621 --> 00:25:56.625
side?
Here is what Δx prime

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:59.259
is equal to.
Can you do this in your head?

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:04.729
If this Δx - uΔt,
this denominator cancels

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:10.809
between dividing this by this,
so it looks like--I just

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:17.150
divided this guy by this guy,
because that's when you divide

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.880
the left-hand side by the
left-hand side,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.796
you have to divide the
right-hand side by the

00:26:23.796 --> 00:26:26.938
right-hand side.
Now, you should have an idea of

00:26:26.938 --> 00:26:31.004
what I'm planning to do.
What do we do next to this

00:26:31.004 --> 00:26:32.420
expression here?

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.429
Yes?
Student:

00:26:39.429 --> 00:26:40.241
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:40.241 --> 00:26:42.329
Shankar: A limit of what?
If we just take a limit of

00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:44.880
Δt going to 0,
you're just going to get 0.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.880
That's not the limit you want
to take.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.760
You've got to bring velocity
into the picture.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.727
Yes?
Student:

00:26:49.727 --> 00:26:50.624
u over t?
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:50.624 --> 00:26:51.773
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student:

00:26:51.773 --> 00:26:53.052
u over the t?
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:53.052 --> 00:26:54.099
Shankar: No.
For any value of u--

00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:54.898
Student:
[inaudible]

00:26:54.898 --> 00:26:56.220
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.379
What you want to do now is to
divide the top and bottom of

00:27:00.379 --> 00:27:04.757
this by Δt because you
got the velocity of the bullet

00:27:04.757 --> 00:27:07.704
according to you.
I want to get the velocity of

00:27:07.704 --> 00:27:09.900
the bullet according to me into
the picture.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.088
That is Δx over
Δt, but this is not a

00:27:13.088 --> 00:27:15.480
typical derivative in calculus,
okay?

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.688
You've got to divide everything
by Δt,

00:27:18.688 --> 00:27:22.966
then you will get Δx
over Δt there - u

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:27.031
divided by 1 - u over
c^(2) times Δx

00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:30.239
over Δt.
This is true even for finite

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:32.069
differences.
Now, take the limit.

00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:36.820
Then, this becomes the velocity
of the bullet - u divided

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.610
by 1 - uv over
c^(2).

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.680
So, you've got to draw a box
around this guy.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.640
This is another great formula.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.930
So, I hope you know why I
divided by Δt.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.825
I want to find the velocity of
the bullet according to you and

00:27:59.825 --> 00:28:02.051
according to me.
For you, I took the distance

00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:03.850
over time.
Well, I've got all these

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.109
distances and times in the top
and bottom.

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:09.049
I divide by the time so
everything turns into velocity.

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:13.079
So, this is the velocity of the
bullet according to me.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:16.178
If you're going to the right,
at a speed u,

00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:18.960
in the good old days,
what would I expect?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.700
You've got to understand that.
My expectation in the old days

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.269
would be v - u,
right?

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:27.016
Whether it's going as speed
v, they're going as speed

00:28:27.016 --> 00:28:30.359
u to the right.
So, you will see a diminished

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:32.870
speed by an amount equal to your
speed.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.299
But now is the twist.
There's something in the

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:39.765
bottom, and the stuff in the
bottom is a number less than 1,

00:28:39.765 --> 00:28:43.980
because of 1 - something.
We're going to jack up velocity.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.717
Therefore, the velocity you
will actually measure is

00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:49.670
somewhat bigger than what I
expected in the old days.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.039
If you ever want to get back to
the good old days in any

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:56.408
relativistic calculation,
you should let the velocity of

00:28:56.408 --> 00:28:59.390
light go to infinity.
Of course, it's not infinity.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.094
What you really mean is
u/c and v/c are

00:29:03.094 --> 00:29:05.200
negligible.
That means my velocity,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.716
the bullet velocity,
they're all small compared to

00:29:07.716 --> 00:29:11.071
the velocity of light;
we get back the answer from the

00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:13.038
old days.
This is the answer from the new

00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:13.290
days.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.190
Now, let's find the beauty of
this result.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:26.281
Let's get the reverse result.
Let us solve for the velocity I

00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:29.740
get in terms of the velocity you
get.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.734
Again, I think you realize you
can do the algebra,

00:29:32.734 --> 00:29:36.279
but you guys should know that
to go from me back to you,

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:39.030
I should simply reverse the
sign of the relative velocity.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.529
This is the backwards result.
In other words,

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:49.809
you're in a train and you fired
a bullet towards the front of

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:52.799
the train.
What speed do I attribute to

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:56.578
the bullet from the ground?
Well, I add the bullet speed to

00:29:56.578 --> 00:29:59.119
the train speed.
That's what the numerator is.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:02.591
The numerator says the answer
is somewhat less than that by

00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:04.369
this number.
Yes?

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:07.545
Student:
[inaudible]

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:13.530
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Thank you very

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.250
much.
Yeah.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.982
That's absolutely correct.
What I really need to do--quite

00:30:21.982 --> 00:30:25.259
correct--it's not simply to
change u to -u,

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:28.578
but to change the velocities
that you were seeing and put

00:30:28.578 --> 00:30:31.660
them in the place of velocities
that I was seeing.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.400
That's correct.
This is what you want to get.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.950
Now, let's look at the strength
of this result.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.322
If someone tells you according
to relatively,

00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:45.749
nothing can go faster than the
speed of light,

00:30:45.749 --> 00:30:48.230
you can try to beat the system
as follows.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.255
You can come to me and say,
"Can there be a gun whose

00:30:51.255 --> 00:30:54.339
bullets go at three-fourths the
velocity of light?"

00:30:54.339 --> 00:30:56.066
and I would say,
"yes," and you'd say,

00:30:56.066 --> 00:30:58.866
"How about a train that goes at
three-fourths the velocity of

00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:00.455
light?"
and I would say that seems to

00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:01.830
be allowed.
Then you can say,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.732
"Well, let me get into this
train at three-fourths the

00:31:04.732 --> 00:31:07.743
velocity of light and fire a
bullet at three-fourths the

00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:10.166
velocity,
then from the ground it should

00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:13.259
appear to be going at 1.5 times
the velocity of light."

00:31:13.259 --> 00:31:15.400
Well, that's the naive
expectation.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.848
But if you do it now,
let's put w = ¾c

00:31:19.848 --> 00:31:24.640
and u = ¾c,
the old answer is disaster;

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.790
it says 1.5c,
but the correct answer is that

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.700
plus (¾)^(2).

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:46.089
So, what is this guy?
This is 1.5c divided by

00:31:46.089 --> 00:31:48.180
1 + 9/16.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:56.738
You multiply everything by 16.
On the top you'll get 24,

00:31:56.738 --> 00:32:00.230
the bottom will get 25 [times]
c.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:04.953
You see, you can jack up the
velocity as seen by the ground

00:32:04.953 --> 00:32:07.812
but it'll never be 1.5.
It'll still be less than the

00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:08.370
velocity of light.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.522
And the last thing you want to
check of this velocity addition

00:32:17.522 --> 00:32:20.099
formula is why we started the
whole thing.

00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:23.410
In other words,
suppose I see a pulse of light.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.690
Let's go back now to this
formula.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:32.660
w is v - u over 1
- uv over c^(2).

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.626
Rather than applying it to a
bullet or whatnot,

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:38.400
let's apply it to the light
pulse itself.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.784
So, I saw a light pulse so I
say the object I saw,

00:32:42.784 --> 00:32:47.436
which is what v stands
for, had a value

00:32:47.436 --> 00:32:51.461
c.
And this is the pre-Einstein

00:32:51.461 --> 00:32:54.637
expectation.
w should be c - u

00:32:54.637 --> 00:32:58.214
because the pulse appears to
travel slower to a person moving

00:32:58.214 --> 00:33:00.480
in the same direction as the
pulse.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.788
But our new formula says it is
really that uc over

00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:07.210
c^(2).

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.115
So, that canceled one part of
c, multiply top and

00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:16.906
bottom by c,
and you will find it is

00:33:16.906 --> 00:33:19.749
c.
So, the velocity of light will

00:33:19.749 --> 00:33:23.282
always come out to be the same.
That is built into the formula

00:33:23.282 --> 00:33:27.020
but it is a good thing to test.
So, what you find is,

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.250
velocities don't add in the
simple way.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.214
If they did, you are in trouble.
You cannot get an upper limit

00:33:34.214 --> 00:33:37.012
if they added in the simple way
because you can put a rocket

00:33:37.012 --> 00:33:39.714
inside another rocket inside
another rocket and add up all

00:33:39.714 --> 00:33:42.369
the speeds and even though each
one is less than 0,

00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:44.050
the total could be whatever you
like.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.460
But they don't add that way.
They add this way so that the

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.520
answer is either bigger than
what you think if v and

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.547
u are opposite,
or smaller than what you think

00:33:53.547 --> 00:33:56.450
if the velocities in the top are
of the same sign.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.424
No matter what you do,
the answer will always be less

00:33:59.424 --> 00:34:03.519
than c.
Okay, so that is the first

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:08.724
conclusion from this.
Second conclusion,

00:34:08.724 --> 00:34:16.826
which is again very staggering,
is that simultaneity is the

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:20.490
relative concept.
In other words,

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:24.148
if two events occur at the same
time for me, they don't occur at

00:34:24.148 --> 00:34:27.440
the same time for you.
That is very surprising.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.187
For example,
if you have twins born,

00:34:30.187 --> 00:34:33.797
one in New-- sorry,
twins cannot be born in New

00:34:33.797 --> 00:34:38.118
York and Los Angeles.
So, I've got to pick two kids

00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:42.592
of different motherhood,
just happened to be born at the

00:34:42.592 --> 00:34:44.880
same time.
When I say "time," we're not

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.474
talking about trivial three-hour
time difference between Los

00:34:47.474 --> 00:34:50.039
Angeles and New York.
That's an artificial thing.

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:51.498
In the Einstein world,
you imagine,

00:34:51.498 --> 00:34:53.429
we all have clocks that read
the same time.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:56.718
So, by that measure,
the two kids are born at the

00:34:56.718 --> 00:35:00.966
same time but if you watch that
from a moving train or a moving

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:03.570
rocket, you will disagree on
that.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.630
You will, in fact,
say they are not simultaneous.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.012
How does that come?
Well, it just comes from going

00:35:09.012 --> 00:35:12.544
to this formula.
Δt prime is Δt -

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:18.334
uΔa x over c^(2)
divided by this number and all

00:35:18.334 --> 00:35:23.243
I'm telling you is,
even though Δt is 0,

00:35:23.243 --> 00:35:28.440
Δt prime is not 0.
Another shock.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.530
Simultaneity is not absolute.
We used to think it's absolute.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.449
In other words,
two events are occurring in Los

00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:40.723
Angeles and New York.
They can be arranged to be

00:35:40.723 --> 00:35:43.583
simultaneous for me,
living on the planet,

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:45.764
let's say,
but if you go in a rocket,

00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:48.019
I expect you to agree they were
simultaneous.

00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:49.840
I mean, how can they be
different?

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.509
Two things are happening right
now in different places,

00:35:52.509 --> 00:35:54.240
it's got to be right now for
you.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.949
But it's not.
It just comes from that formula.

00:35:56.949 --> 00:36:00.379
Once again, if the velocity of
light is made much bigger than

00:36:00.379 --> 00:36:03.855
everything in the problem,
simply to set it to infinity,

00:36:03.855 --> 00:36:06.829
you will find Δt prime
is Δt.

00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:12.111
That goes back to Galilean
times or the old pre-Einstein

00:36:12.111 --> 00:36:14.943
times.
That's why in relativity,

00:36:14.943 --> 00:36:19.565
space and time form a new
space-time and time is called a

00:36:19.565 --> 00:36:24.269
fourth component because if
c goes to infinity,

00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:27.119
Δ prime is always
Δt and t prime is

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.292
always t.
If the coordinate never mixes

00:36:29.292 --> 00:36:31.487
with anything else,
it doesn't deserve to be called

00:36:31.487 --> 00:36:33.496
a coordinate,
whereas, it's the x and

00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:35.934
y coordinates that mix
with each other when you do

00:36:35.934 --> 00:36:37.466
rotations.
After Einstein,

00:36:37.466 --> 00:36:41.398
the space and time coordinates
mix with each other to give you

00:36:41.398 --> 00:36:45.460
new space and time coordinates
under Lorentz transformation,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.309
which means,
when seen in a moving train.

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:52.644
That's why time is now elevated
to another dimension because it

00:36:52.644 --> 00:36:56.630
transforms very much the way
x and y did.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.329
The details of the
transformation are different.

00:36:58.329 --> 00:37:01.062
We have sines and cosines
replaced by u and

00:37:01.062 --> 00:37:04.297
u over the square root
but it's still mathematically

00:37:04.297 --> 00:37:07.030
the way components of vectors
will transform.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.340
Okay, so simultaneity is
relative.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:14.679
So, you have to ask yourself,
"How did that happen?"

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:18.059
So, here's the famous example
that is given in all the books.

00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:20.360
Maybe it was given by Einstein,
I'm not sure.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.530
So, here's a train.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.190
Let's say the train is at rest
and you are standing in the

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.384
middle and you want to arrange
for two events to be

00:37:31.384 --> 00:37:33.659
simultaneous.
Oh by the way,

00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:38.650
there is one catch.
If the two events occurred at

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:44.097
the same time and the same
place, Δx = 0,

00:37:44.097 --> 00:37:47.360
Δt = 0;
then, the transformation will

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.800
tell you Δx prime is 0
and Δt prime is 0.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.158
Because two events occurring at
the same time,

00:37:53.158 --> 00:37:56.070
at the same place means,
for example,

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.907
my two hands came and clapped,
the two hands were at the same

00:37:58.907 --> 00:38:00.861
time at the same place.
If someone said,

00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:03.466
well, they were not at the same
place at the same time,

00:38:03.466 --> 00:38:06.889
it means I didn't clap.
Two cars collide.

00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:10.288
So, if two things occur at the
same time at the same place,

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:13.159
something happened that they
met in space-time.

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:16.304
You cannot find another
observer who says they did not

00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:19.270
meet in space-time,
or they'll say the two cars did

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.911
not collide.
Even after relativity,

00:38:21.911 --> 00:38:26.294
it is true that two events at
the same time and same place

00:38:26.294 --> 00:38:30.369
occur the same time and same
place for all people.

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:36.262
Same time alone is not enough
and same place alone is not

00:38:36.262 --> 00:38:38.340
enough.
You see that?

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.368
If two cars came and they
collided, they were at the same

00:38:41.368 --> 00:38:44.503
time at the same place.
If the cars were at the same

00:38:44.503 --> 00:38:47.179
time, here and there,
that's no accident.

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:49.923
If they were at the same place
because if this car went and two

00:38:49.923 --> 00:38:51.914
minutes later that car went at
the same place,

00:38:51.914 --> 00:38:54.892
nothing happens.
That's why you say this poor

00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:58.329
guy was in the wrong place at
the wrong time.

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:00.540
You don't want to say this guy
was in the wrong place.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.751
What does that mean?
You can go to the Battle of

00:39:02.751 --> 00:39:05.240
Gettysburg site and stand now
and nothing happens to you

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.730
because it's the same place but
it's the wrong time.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.393
Okay?
We all realize,

00:39:09.393 --> 00:39:12.160
same place, same time,
is a congruence in space-time

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.981
and even after Einstein,
you cannot say something did

00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:16.860
not happen.
Okay.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.780
We leave that to politicians
please.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.784
It did happen.
It still happened and the

00:39:21.784 --> 00:39:25.250
equations have the property but
I've got several events

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.010
separated in space but at the
same time.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.543
You're in the train.
Your job is to make two things

00:39:30.543 --> 00:39:33.030
happen at the same time and
here's what you do.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.353
You send a beam of light that
splits into a,

00:39:36.353 --> 00:39:39.289
you know, here's a blown up
picture.

00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:42.374
Beam of light comes and splits
like that and goes to the back

00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:45.022
and front of the train.
You're in the middle of the

00:39:45.022 --> 00:39:48.150
train, and you know that events
will be simultaneous for you.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.987
The pulse travels on either
side and hits the two things at

00:39:51.987 --> 00:39:56.022
the two ends and sets off two
explosions and you have done the

00:39:56.022 --> 00:39:59.000
best you can to have
simultaneous events.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.619
Okay now, I see you from the
ground.

00:40:03.619 --> 00:40:05.854
So, all this happening in the
moving train,

00:40:05.854 --> 00:40:08.568
you have every right to say
you're not moving but to

00:40:08.568 --> 00:40:10.590
me--relative to me you are
moving.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.002
That's a fact.
And I look at how well you did

00:40:13.002 --> 00:40:15.889
with this.
So, you sent off these two

00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:18.329
light pulses.
Then what happened?

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:21.727
This wall of the train is
moving away from the light

00:40:21.727 --> 00:40:23.324
pulse.
This wall of the train,

00:40:23.324 --> 00:40:25.223
the rear end,
is rushing to meet the light

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:27.869
pulse.
Now, the velocity of light is

00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:32.789
the same for everybody so I can
think in terms of what happens.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:35.450
If one wall is rushing to meet
the light pulse and one wall is

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.019
running away from the light
pulse,

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:39.690
I know very clearly the
firecracker in the back of the

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.714
train will go off first and in
the front of the train will go

00:40:42.714 --> 00:40:47.533
off later.
That means that Δt will

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:50.794
not be 0.
In fact, you can see Δt

00:40:50.794 --> 00:40:54.475
will be negative because the
event with the greater x

00:40:54.475 --> 00:40:58.485
coordinate occurs later.
That's also an agreement of the

00:40:58.485 --> 00:41:00.052
formula.
If Δt = 0,

00:41:00.052 --> 00:41:02.630
then Δx prime will be
some negative number.

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:07.719
Now, why do we bring in the
light pulse?

00:41:07.719 --> 00:41:10.890
We bring in the light pulse
because we can tell that they

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.230
were simply not simultaneous
because about the light we know

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.147
this.
Its velocity is the same for

00:41:16.147 --> 00:41:18.240
everybody.
That's why all arguments in

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.150
relativity involve doing things
with light pulses or

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.030
communicating with a light pulse
because we know what light does.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.780
It travels at one and the same
velocity for all people.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.047
That's a postulate.
Therefore, we know you couldn't

00:41:31.047 --> 00:41:35.553
have done any better in making
them simultaneous and I simply

00:41:35.553 --> 00:41:38.500
disagree with you.
I'd say they just did not

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.461
happen at the same time,
and there's no question of who

00:41:41.461 --> 00:41:43.062
is right.
Operationally,

00:41:43.062 --> 00:41:47.168
for me, those two events were
separated in time by some amount

00:41:47.168 --> 00:41:50.876
and for you they were not.
That's a great new idea that

00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:54.139
things did not happen the same
time for all people,

00:41:54.139 --> 00:41:57.079
and relativity tells you that
they didn't and tells you by how

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:00.739
much they were different.
Okay.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:03.739
Then, I take the next surprise
here.

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:06.130
The next surprise has to do
with clocks.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.519
The claim is that clocks will
not run at the same rate.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:14.981
Okay, when we bought the
clocks, we compared them,

00:42:14.981 --> 00:42:18.333
we got them from the same shop,
they were completely in synch

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:21.837
and you put one in your train
and you got into your train and

00:42:21.837 --> 00:42:25.166
the claim is that I will find
that your clocks are running

00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:29.300
slow.
Let me show that to you.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.973
Again, if you want to do
anything with relativity,

00:42:31.973 --> 00:42:34.734
at least learn this one thing.
Go back to Lorentz

00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:37.890
transformation and think in
terms of events that are just

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.306
going to come out of the wash.
If you try something original

00:42:41.306 --> 00:42:43.829
on your own, you people do all
kinds of stuff.

00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:46.257
I've seen you going in a
cyclical circular or arguments

00:42:46.257 --> 00:42:49.180
from which you cannot even come
out until somebody rescues you.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.139
So don't do that.
So, I'm looking at a clock.

00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:56.095
You've got to ask yourself,
how do I turn this issue of

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:59.820
time into a pair of events?
I have my clock,

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.120
so it goes tick-tock,
tick-tock.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.156
I pick two events.
Event 1: a clock says tick,

00:43:08.156 --> 00:43:12.320
and event 2:
clock says tock.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.458
I tell you why I have tick and
tock because I want to have two

00:43:15.458 --> 00:43:18.340
distant kind of events so that
we can talk about them.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.650
So, this event is a clock that
I'm carrying with me.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.338
The clock is with me.
So, let me put a clock at the

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:30.060
center of my coordinates system
or the origin.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.750
It doesn't matter where it is.
Let me put it at the origin.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.851
The space-time coordinate x
= 0, t = 0 is the

00:43:36.851 --> 00:43:38.690
first tick of the clock.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.288
How about the next tick?
The next tick,

00:43:45.288 --> 00:43:49.514
this is x and t
coordinates, the tock of the

00:43:49.514 --> 00:43:52.924
clock, let me call
τ_0 is the

00:43:52.924 --> 00:43:55.590
time of the clock.
It's a time period;

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.719
how many seconds elapsed
between the tick and the tock.

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:03.805
The main question is,
"What is the location of the

00:44:03.805 --> 00:44:07.480
second tick of the clock?"
Where does that happen?

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.298
Yes?
Student:

00:44:10.298 --> 00:44:11.461
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:13.364
Shankar: It doesn't move
with respect to me and I'm

00:44:13.364 --> 00:44:15.408
talking about a clock that I'm
holding in my hand so if the

00:44:15.408 --> 00:44:17.030
first event took place at x
= 0,

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.730
second one also takes place at
x = 0.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.250
You understand?
I'm holding the clock.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.518
I've traveled forward in time.
It's τ_0

00:44:24.518 --> 00:44:27.418
seconds later but the clock has
not gone anywhere so the two

00:44:27.418 --> 00:44:29.531
events,
the two tickings of the clock,

00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:31.748
are separated in space by 0 and
in time by

00:44:31.748 --> 00:44:35.389
τ_0.
That means Δx =

00:44:35.389 --> 00:44:39.970
0, Δt =
τ_0.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.694
What do you get?
According to you,

00:44:42.694 --> 00:44:46.526
the time difference between the
two ticks is Δt,

00:44:46.526 --> 00:44:50.010
which is τ_0
- u etc.,

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:54.810
times 0 divided by this factor.
So, that means the time

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.179
difference between the two ticks
would be bigger.

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:02.385
If τ_0 is 1
second, if you divide 1 by [root

00:45:02.385 --> 00:45:04.329
of]
1 - u^(2) over c^(2),

00:45:04.329 --> 00:45:06.880
 you're going to find out
it is less.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.393
There's more.
For example,

00:45:09.393 --> 00:45:12.815
if this factor in the
denominator is .5,

00:45:12.815 --> 00:45:17.818
then Δt would be 2
times τ_0. In

00:45:17.818 --> 00:45:20.778
other words,
when your clock has taken 1

00:45:20.778 --> 00:45:24.203
second to go from 1 tick to the
next, I will say according to me

00:45:24.203 --> 00:45:26.269
the real time elapsed is 2
seconds.

00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:28.750
It can be 10 seconds,
it can 100 seconds.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.491
You can make Δt as big
as you like by letting you

00:45:31.491 --> 00:45:32.470
approach c.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.583
Yes?
Student:

00:45:39.583 --> 00:45:40.755
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:40.755 --> 00:45:43.890
Shankar: Thank you.
I'm having this problem today

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.415
with the prime.
t prime is

00:45:46.415 --> 00:45:49.366
τ_0 over this.
If you put

00:45:49.366 --> 00:45:50.990
τ_0,
I put 1 second.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:54.559
Question there, guys?
Student:

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.199
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:00.800
Shankar: No,
u did not go to 0.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.883
u is not 0.
uΔx over c^(2,)

00:46:04.883 --> 00:46:07.440
it is the Δx that went
to 0.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:13.465
Go the Lorentz transformation.
Δt prime is Δt -

00:46:13.465 --> 00:46:19.199
uΔx over c^(2).
Δx = 0.

00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:24.549
That's where I'm telling the
equation the clock is at rest

00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:27.358
with respect to me.
That means that--

00:46:27.358 --> 00:46:28.641
Student:
[inaudible]

00:46:28.641 --> 00:46:30.515
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:46:30.515 --> 00:46:32.032
no.
In this example,

00:46:32.032 --> 00:46:35.960
let the unprimed observer be
the one holding the clock.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.615
Then Δx is,
you know Δt is whatever

00:46:38.615 --> 00:46:40.909
the time of the clock is.
1 second.

00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:43.962
Δt prime is seen by
anybody else going at a speed

00:46:43.962 --> 00:46:46.989
u relative to me.
You can also do it backwards by

00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:50.158
taking the clock in the hands of
the S prime but you've

00:46:50.158 --> 00:46:53.344
got to do a little more work.
It's a lot easier here because

00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:56.139
I get to pump into the equation
two facts at one shot,

00:46:56.139 --> 00:46:59.882
that the time between the two
ticks is 1 second and it's at

00:46:59.882 --> 00:47:03.193
rest with respect to me,
which is why the Δx

00:47:03.193 --> 00:47:06.231
vanished between the two ticks.
If I want to use your

00:47:06.231 --> 00:47:09.324
equations, Δx prime
won't be 0 because the clock has

00:47:09.324 --> 00:47:11.754
moved and you can do it.
I've, I think,

00:47:11.754 --> 00:47:15.740
shown in my notes how to do
that but it's unnecessary.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.929
This is the main result.
Now, here is the paradox.

00:47:18.929 --> 00:47:22.350
You can go back to the
backwards equations.

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.990
Let's do this informally, okay.
Let's not write it again.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.950
It will look like this.
Right.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.093
You know that.
Let's take a clock you are

00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:35.134
carrying.
It ticks off 1 second,

00:47:35.134 --> 00:47:38.954
so between the tick and the
next tick, the time difference

00:47:38.954 --> 00:47:41.318
is 1 second,
space difference is 0,

00:47:41.318 --> 00:47:44.159
I'll find Δt is 1 over
a square root.

00:47:44.159 --> 00:47:47.137
So, I will say your clock is
slow, you'll say my clock is

00:47:47.137 --> 00:47:50.860
slow.
How is that possible?

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.739
How can it be that we accuse
each other of having--yes?

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:57.520
Student:
[inaudible]

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.585
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:05.931
you're absolutely right.
The predictions are in

00:48:05.931 --> 00:48:09.496
agreement with that principle,
but I ask you to think about

00:48:09.496 --> 00:48:11.340
the conflict you have,
yes?

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.835
Student:
[inaudible]

00:48:13.835 --> 00:48:17.483
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:48:17.483 --> 00:48:20.366
that's very good.
Student:

00:48:20.366 --> 00:48:22.271
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:24.350
Shankar: No,
that is correct.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.034
Let me repeat what he said.
He said, if there are two

00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:29.967
people, they were right next to
each other, they are at the same

00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:32.761
height and they move apart and
each person looks at the other

00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:35.368
person and finds the person
diminished in size because of

00:48:35.368 --> 00:48:37.834
the distance,
and each person can tell the

00:48:37.834 --> 00:48:40.300
other person you look small from
where I am.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.499
In fact, even more paradoxical
is how in this world two people

00:48:43.499 --> 00:48:45.860
can simultaneously look down on
each other.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.616
You figure that out.
There are two people who

00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:51.713
simultaneously have higher
opinion of themselves to the

00:48:51.713 --> 00:48:55.039
other person and are the same
thing, they look down on each

00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:57.059
other.
I have not found how many space

00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:59.613
dimensions I should embed but
these people to make it that

00:48:59.613 --> 00:49:01.539
possible, but this is certainly
correct.

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:04.340
A spatial resolution does give
the impression.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.621
So, here's the answer that's
usually given to explain this to

00:49:07.621 --> 00:49:09.914
you.
If I take a real clock like

00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:14.062
this watch here and I ask you
why does it look slow to you

00:49:14.062 --> 00:49:18.378
when I'm moving relative to you,
it's difficult because it's got

00:49:18.378 --> 00:49:21.686
electronics and stuff and I
still don't know how to set the

00:49:21.686 --> 00:49:24.025
clock on my VCR.
I'm not going to figure that

00:49:24.025 --> 00:49:25.927
out.
So, for all of us guys who are

00:49:25.927 --> 00:49:29.004
challenged, there is a clock
that's particularly simple,

00:49:29.004 --> 00:49:33.821
and the clock works like this.
It has got two mirrors and a

00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:39.764
light pulse just goes up and
down between the mirrors and

00:49:39.764 --> 00:49:44.010
every time it completes a round
trip,

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:46.849
it sets off some detector and
it goes "click."

00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:50.676
Now, this is very important to
mention that this is my x

00:49:50.676 --> 00:49:54.010
coordinate and that's the
y coordinate and I did

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:57.590
not show you here there are
logical arguments and why,

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.154
if you and I are moving along
x, why our y

00:50:00.154 --> 00:50:02.300
coordinates, if they agree in
the beginning,

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:05.183
continue to agree.
That's because if you say

00:50:05.183 --> 00:50:07.925
something is two meters tall and
they pass each other,

00:50:07.925 --> 00:50:11.132
you cannot have a disagreement
on the fact that heights are the

00:50:11.132 --> 00:50:13.089
same.
But as in a linear dimension

00:50:13.089 --> 00:50:15.968
there is room for discussion,
in the transverse dimension

00:50:15.968 --> 00:50:18.279
there isn't.
So, anyway, I have this clock

00:50:18.279 --> 00:50:21.340
that goes up and down.
Light pulse goes up and down.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:24.717
It goes a certain distance,
L, in a vertical

00:50:24.717 --> 00:50:28.769
direction, and 2L/c is
the time period of my clock.

00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:30.840
That's the time for a round
trip.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.170
You look at my clock and what
do you think is happening?

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:38.517
Remember, you are moving to the
right, relative to me,

00:50:38.517 --> 00:50:41.674
so according to you my clock is
moving to the left,

00:50:41.674 --> 00:50:43.380
and it looks like this.

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:51.790
Light beam is going on a zigzag
path, according to you.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.091
You agree that's very clear.
For me, the pulse is going up

00:50:55.091 --> 00:50:57.989
and down, for you it's going on
the hypotenuse.

00:50:57.989 --> 00:51:01.255
You can imagine how with the
hypotenuse u^(2) and

00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:04.758
c^(2) are going to come
from drawing the sides of the

00:51:04.758 --> 00:51:07.215
triangle.
That's why the time would come

00:51:07.215 --> 00:51:10.655
out longer.
Now, why do they like this

00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:12.596
clock?
Because we know everything

00:51:12.596 --> 00:51:14.159
about the operation of the
clock.

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:18.802
We know that this path is
longer than the straight up and

00:51:18.802 --> 00:51:23.860
down path because the transfers'
coordinate is known to us.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.605
Furthermore,
we know the velocity of light

00:51:25.605 --> 00:51:27.349
is the same in all frames of
reference;

00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:30.254
so, light going on a longer
path is simply going to take

00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:33.856
longer.
So, I know your clock would

00:51:33.856 --> 00:51:36.239
slow down.
Now, here is the beauty.

00:51:36.239 --> 00:51:38.762
The beauty is that,
if you have a clock that's

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.949
going up and down,
straight up and down,

00:51:40.949 --> 00:51:43.640
when I see it,
it's going to look like this.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.740
So, it's as simple as saying
that if you had these two

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.895
clocks, what I think is going up
and down and you think it's a

00:51:53.895 --> 00:51:56.252
zigzag this way,
and I look at your clock,

00:51:56.252 --> 00:51:59.269
it's a zigzag the other way,
it's perfectly okay for me to

00:51:59.269 --> 00:52:01.550
say to you,
your light pulse is going on a

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.631
hypotenuse and mine is going up
and down, and why you can say

00:52:04.631 --> 00:52:08.217
that to me.
So, at least this light clock

00:52:08.217 --> 00:52:13.260
explains to you why clocks will
appear to be slow.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.544
Now, the question you can ask
is, what if I have some other

00:52:16.544 --> 00:52:19.490
clock with gears and wheels and
teeth and whatnot?

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.948
How does that slow down?
The answer is,

00:52:21.948 --> 00:52:26.500
we don't know exactly how to
explain that clock but I know

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.532
that if you carry a light clock
and another clock made of wheels

00:52:31.532 --> 00:52:34.513
and gears,
they should run at the same

00:52:34.513 --> 00:52:36.584
rate.
They should run at the same

00:52:36.584 --> 00:52:39.251
rate because if they ran at
different rates,

00:52:39.251 --> 00:52:43.255
one slowed down and one didn't,
in comparing the two clocks you

00:52:43.255 --> 00:52:46.801
can determine your velocity,
and that we know is impossible

00:52:46.801 --> 00:52:50.469
by the postulate that you cannot
detect uniform velocity.

00:52:50.469 --> 00:52:53.666
Therefore, if the light clock
does something,

00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:57.444
all clocks must do the same
thing regardless of their

00:52:57.444 --> 00:53:01.150
mechanism, and that includes
biological clocks.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:05.001
So, if you have a clock which
is just yourself,

00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:08.770
I look at you,
you know, over 15 or 20 years I

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.714
notice some changes.
You become taller,

00:53:11.714 --> 00:53:14.260
then your hair turns white,
your teeth fall off.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.889
That's a clock and that clock
should also slow down.

00:53:17.889 --> 00:53:21.284
I don't care how your life
systems work but you are a clock

00:53:21.284 --> 00:53:24.280
and you've got to slow down.
That's why we can make

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.665
predictions about what happened
to living systems even though

00:53:27.665 --> 00:53:30.460
that's not our main business.
So, in particular,

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.213
if you take a clock,
which is made up of mechanical

00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:36.751
parts and a human being,
and they travel at high speeds,

00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:40.590
the aging of the human being
should slow down just like the

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.039
clock's ticking will slow it
down,

00:53:43.039 --> 00:53:44.880
without knowing the reasons for
it.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.280
So, this leads to a very famous
paradox called the Twin Paradox.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.322
The Twin Paradox says that
you've got two guys,

00:53:53.322 --> 00:53:56.191
twins.
Now, this is actually a valid

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:58.243
example.
They were born at the same

00:53:58.243 --> 00:54:00.891
time, same place,
and then the one goes on a trip

00:54:00.891 --> 00:54:04.090
at some speed u,
and goes around and comes back.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:08.740
So, I think the person's been
gone for 20 years,

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.655
my twin.
So, let's say he was 20 when he

00:54:11.655 --> 00:54:14.760
left, so I expect him to be 40
when he gets back.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.208
But he'll come back younger
because as a clock,

00:54:19.208 --> 00:54:23.400
he has slowed down.
So, what I think is 20 years,

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.932
this could be,
my time is 20 years,

00:54:25.932 --> 00:54:30.104
but his time could be 10
because his factor downstairs is

00:54:30.104 --> 00:54:33.052
.5.
So, he can come back being

00:54:33.052 --> 00:54:35.719
younger than me.
Yes?

00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:38.236
Student:
[inaudible]

00:54:38.236 --> 00:54:41.913
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:54:41.913 --> 00:54:46.329
but we've got to be careful.
So, his point had something to

00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:48.659
do with acceleration,
but the real question is this.

00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:52.833
See, if I'm on the ground and I
send my twin on the trip and we

00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:55.659
meet, now the clocks are being
compared.

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:58.081
As long as the zigzag is going
this way and that zigzag is

00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:59.949
going that way,
you can say what you like.

00:54:59.949 --> 00:55:02.146
But what if the clocks are
brought head-to-head and

00:55:02.146 --> 00:55:04.604
compared?
Can they both be slower than

00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:06.840
the other?
We know that's impossible.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.355
So, instead of clocks,
we use human beings and

00:55:09.355 --> 00:55:12.429
dramatize the paradox and say,
"Who will be younger?"

00:55:12.429 --> 00:55:14.140
Me or the twin who went on the
rocket?

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.249
Well, there can only be one
answer to that question,

00:55:20.249 --> 00:55:23.312
and yet no matter what the twin
says, I have no reason to

00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:26.030
believe that I moved.
You are the one who went on the

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:28.600
trip the opposite way so you've
got to be younger than me.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.230
Yes?
Student:

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:38.634
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:38.634 --> 00:55:44.240
Shankar: Very good.
Okay.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.139
I couldn't have said it better.
Let me repeat it.

00:55:46.139 --> 00:55:47.698
The point is,
as long as you've got

00:55:47.698 --> 00:55:50.264
oppositely moving clocks,
they can believe what they want

00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:53.105
of each other,
but if you want the clocks to

00:55:53.105 --> 00:55:56.789
be subject to a comparison,
then you can never compare

00:55:56.789 --> 00:56:01.030
objects that are constantly
moving at opposite velocities.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:04.539
So, somebody's got to turn
around and come back.

00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:07.722
So, in the case of the twin,
he and I were abreast,

00:56:07.722 --> 00:56:11.605
the twin got into the rocket to
set up the velocity difference

00:56:11.605 --> 00:56:14.321
between him and me.
So, in the early stages,

00:56:14.321 --> 00:56:16.929
he is the one undergoing
acceleration and not me.

00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:20.335
Likewise, the twin went
somewhere and stopped and turned

00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:23.298
around and came back.
The twin is suffering the

00:56:23.298 --> 00:56:25.695
deceleration.
So, there are two periods at

00:56:25.695 --> 00:56:28.656
least, during the voyage,
when the twin has no right to

00:56:28.656 --> 00:56:30.960
claim that he is not moving,
that I am.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.829
That's why we don't have the
same status.

00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:37.329
Whereas for me,
the whole time Newton's laws

00:56:37.329 --> 00:56:40.119
and the laws of inertia were
operating for me,

00:56:40.119 --> 00:56:42.064
whereas for him and the rocket
during takeoff,

00:56:42.064 --> 00:56:44.571
things started flying off and
during landing things started

00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:47.183
flying off.
He cannot possibly claim he has

00:56:47.183 --> 00:56:50.123
the same status as me.
That's why in that problem,

00:56:50.123 --> 00:56:53.091
the relationship is not
symmetrical, and one person can

00:56:53.091 --> 00:56:55.949
say I did not move because I was
always inertial,

00:56:55.949 --> 00:56:58.692
the other will have,
I have to concede that he

00:56:58.692 --> 00:56:59.989
moved.
Yes?

00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:02.179
Student:
[inaudible]

00:57:02.179 --> 00:57:05.800
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.770
Then if you do it,
if you give them symmetrical

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.570
acceleration,
both leave like this and both

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.260
come back.
Then, both will agree on their

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.370
age but they will disagree with
the person on the ground.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:16.310
Suppose there's some triplets.
You have triplets and two kids

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.561
are sent out that way,
third one stays back,

00:57:18.561 --> 00:57:21.860
the third one that stays back
will be older than the others.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.900
So, this is not science fiction
at all.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:28.000
If you want to be alive for the
year 3000, you can do it.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.498
You just have to get into a
rocket, at sufficient velocity

00:57:31.498 --> 00:57:35.199
close to the speed of light,
so that this is 3000 years,

00:57:35.199 --> 00:57:38.920
okay, and you figure out how
long you've got to live.

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.848
Maybe another 50 years.
Do the math,

00:57:40.848 --> 00:57:43.742
you find the speed,
get into the rocket and go and

00:57:43.742 --> 00:57:46.147
come back.
Now, this experiment is done

00:57:46.147 --> 00:57:49.130
all the time with microscopic
particles, you know.

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:51.230
They are accelerated in
Fermilab, for example.

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:54.314
They go around in a ring and
just by virtue of their motion,

00:57:54.314 --> 00:57:57.787
they live a very long time.
So, particles are supposed to

00:57:57.787 --> 00:58:01.702
have a short lifetime which you
calculate in their own rest

00:58:01.702 --> 00:58:03.905
frame,
live much longer because they

00:58:03.905 --> 00:58:07.373
are moving, and one way to keep
them moving is to put them on an

00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:10.400
accelerated ring and they live
for a very long time.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.652
Yes?
Student:

00:58:12.652 --> 00:58:15.627
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:58:15.627 --> 00:58:19.647
Shankar: No.
No, the rocket will think I'm

00:58:19.647 --> 00:58:22.564
50 years older.
If you went on the rocket,

00:58:22.564 --> 00:58:26.360
it's 50 years for you but for
people on the ground it's 3,000

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.676
years.
Student:

00:58:27.676 --> 00:58:29.318
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:58:29.318 --> 00:58:31.756
Shankar: Yeah,
but if you don't want to age at

00:58:31.756 --> 00:58:34.460
all, you can arrange it.
You want, what, five years?

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.710
Okay.
You just fixed the number.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:41.650
You want to age only .5 years,
that's another number.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:44.825
You'll never run out of numbers.
You can let u approach

00:58:44.825 --> 00:58:48.082
c as much as you like and
you can live as long as you want

00:58:48.082 --> 00:58:50.269
and you can come back whenever
you want.

00:58:50.269 --> 00:58:53.067
Other issues like going
backwards in time--I'll come

00:58:53.067 --> 00:58:55.860
back to that later.
There are problems with that.

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.490
We'll come to that,
but you can stop time as far as

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.250
we know, and we see it all the
time.

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:06.490
The muons produced in the upper
atmosphere, their lifetime is

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.530
something, 10 to - 6 seconds or
whatever.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:11.677
Even if they travel at the
speed of light,

00:59:11.677 --> 00:59:14.768
we see their time is not long
enough to cross the atmosphere

00:59:14.768 --> 00:59:17.269
but they make it here.
How did they make it?

00:59:17.269 --> 00:59:19.925
They make it because their
lifetime is computed in their

00:59:19.925 --> 00:59:22.052
frame of reference.
They still think they lived

00:59:22.052 --> 00:59:24.071
only their lifetime,
but I think they lived a much

00:59:24.071 --> 00:59:27.119
longer time.
That's how they made it to here.

00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:30.320
But how about from their point
of view?

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.543
They only lived a short time
and how did they go 100

00:59:32.543 --> 00:59:34.667
kilometers?
That's the next thing I'm going

00:59:34.667 --> 00:59:36.262
to tell you.
According to them,

00:59:36.262 --> 00:59:38.724
the atmosphere is not 100
kilometers but maybe 8

00:59:38.724 --> 00:59:41.184
kilometers long.
Now, that's the last point

00:59:41.184 --> 00:59:43.719
which has to do with the length
contraction.

00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:48.125
So length contraction says,
by the way, so thing to

00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:53.499
remember what time dilatation
is: Every clock runs the fastest

00:59:53.499 --> 00:59:58.078
in its own rest frame.
In any other frame of reference

00:59:58.078 --> 01:00:02.065
in which a clock has any
velocity, it will appear to be

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:06.199
slower than the advertised time
period of that clock.

01:00:06.199 --> 01:00:09.809
The last thing I want to do is
length contraction.

01:00:09.809 --> 01:00:13.897
Length contraction says,
if you have a meter stick and

01:00:13.897 --> 01:00:17.289
you and I bought them from the
same store,

01:00:17.289 --> 01:00:20.963
once you're in this plane or
this rocket, I will claim your

01:00:20.963 --> 01:00:23.940
meter stick is actually shorter
than a meter.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.180
In fact, a shortening factor is
this.

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:35.068
This is the shortening factor.
In fact, way back,

01:00:35.068 --> 01:00:37.178
in the derivation of the laws
of transformation,

01:00:37.178 --> 01:00:40.199
the fudge factor I calculated,
taking your lengths into my

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.050
lengths, is precisely connected
with this factor.

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:46.891
If you say the length to
something, I will tell you that

01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:51.222
the length is actually less than
that because your meter sticks

01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:53.670
are short.
But let me prove that to you.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:56.980
So, let's take a rod that's
moving.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:02.585
It's moving at a speed u;
you're carrying the rod and I

01:01:02.585 --> 01:01:06.070
want to find its length.
What should I do?

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:09.487
That's the question, okay?
So, the rod is moving at speed

01:01:09.487 --> 01:01:11.889
u.
I want to find its length.

01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:23.550
So, Δx prime is Δx
- uΔt over the square root.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.590
I'm going to make a pair of
events to find the length of the

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:28.685
rod.
Event 1, remember this rod is

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.518
zooming past me,
Event 1 is when this front end

01:01:31.518 --> 01:01:35.028
of the rod hits a certain
marking on my graduated x

01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:38.537
axis and event 2 is when the
back end of the train hits my

01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:39.400
origin,

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.413
and the distance between those
two is the length of the rod,

01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:50.429
provided one condition.
How do you find the length of a

01:01:50.429 --> 01:01:53.848
moving rod?
You find this end and that end

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:58.045
at the same time.
Otherwise you will screw up,

01:01:58.045 --> 01:01:59.869
right?
If you find this end now,

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:02.820
go on a lunch break and come
back and the road is over there.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.299
And I said that's the rear end
of the rod, and you get back to

01:02:05.299 --> 01:02:07.074
be the length;
that's not how you find the

01:02:07.074 --> 01:02:09.538
length of a moving object.
You find the length by

01:02:09.538 --> 01:02:13.190
measuring the coordinates of the
two ends at the same time.

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.412
Consequently,
at the same time means

01:02:16.412 --> 01:02:20.661
Δt must be 0;
Δx is the length

01:02:20.661 --> 01:02:24.228
according to you.
According to the person going

01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:26.129
with the rod,
the two events,

01:02:26.129 --> 01:02:29.659
since they take place at the
two ends of the rod,

01:02:29.659 --> 01:02:32.506
are separated by the length of
the rod because the rod,

01:02:32.506 --> 01:02:34.720
according to you,
is not going anywhere.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.739
Suppose you have the rod.
It's not moving relative to you.

01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:39.816
Something happens at one end,
something happens with the

01:02:39.816 --> 01:02:41.679
other end.
What's the spatial distance

01:02:41.679 --> 01:02:43.949
between them?
It's the length of the rod.

01:02:43.949 --> 01:02:45.659
That's the meaning of the
length of the rod.

01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:48.636
Therefore, if you
cross-multiply,

01:02:48.636 --> 01:02:51.520
you get this result,
L is

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.752
L_0 times--;So,
a rod will appear longest in

01:02:56.752 --> 01:03:00.720
its rest frame and to anybody
else it will appear shorter.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:06.570
Clocks appear fastest in the
rest frame;

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.050
rods appear longest in the rest
frame.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:15.680
For anybody to whom a rod is
moving, the rod appears short.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.990
So, here's another paradox then.

01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:22.570
I make a hole in my x
axis.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.190
I make the hole to be half a
meter long.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.619
This is half a meter.
You and I bought a meter stick

01:03:34.619 --> 01:03:39.199
but you are moving at a velocity
where this number has become

01:03:39.199 --> 01:03:41.349
half.
u over c is 1

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:43.752
over root 2.
u^(2) over c^(2)

01:03:43.752 --> 01:03:45.872
is whatever.
Look, it's whatever it takes to

01:03:45.872 --> 01:03:49.405
make this factor half.
So, I expect your meter stick

01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:52.260
to have shrunk to half its
length.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.275
So, I make a hole on the table,
half a meter long,

01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:58.106
the rod goes by,
I think it would fall into the

01:03:58.106 --> 01:04:01.590
hole.
That's my expectation.

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:04.412
You come and say,
my meter stick is a meter

01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:06.595
stick.
The hole that you dug that you

01:04:06.595 --> 01:04:09.501
think is half a meter long
actually is a quarter meter

01:04:09.501 --> 01:04:11.426
long.
So, there's no way my meter

01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:14.838
stick is going through that hole
in the table because it's four

01:04:14.838 --> 01:04:17.150
times as long as the hole in the
table.

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:20.085
Do you understand that?
Normally, you make a meter

01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:22.910
stick, you put it on top of a
hole of the same length,

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:25.386
it will fall down.
But if it's a moving meter

01:04:25.386 --> 01:04:28.361
stick, which has contracted
according to me from one meter

01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:30.814
to half a meter,
half a meter hole is enough for

01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:33.387
it to fall.
But from your vantage point,

01:04:33.387 --> 01:04:37.050
my half a meter hole looks like
a quarter of a meter hole.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:39.190
Your meter stick still looks
like a meter.

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:41.710
The question is,
when this experiment occurs,

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:45.880
will it fall or not?
Hey, these are all paradoxes.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.104
If you invented the theory,
you have got to defend these

01:04:48.104 --> 01:04:49.999
paradoxes.
You cannot get two answers to

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:52.050
one question.
That's a logical issue.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.962
So, the answer to these
problems is, if you know one

01:04:57.962 --> 01:05:00.469
point of view in which it is
correct, that's the right

01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:02.255
answer.
Then, the other person has to

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:04.695
figure out what happened.
So, in my point of view,

01:05:04.695 --> 01:05:07.960
if I made a half a meter hole
and your rod has shrunk to half

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.969
the length, it's going to fall.
It will fall.

01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:13.196
The question is,
how does the other person

01:05:13.196 --> 01:05:15.639
reconcile himself to the fact
that here is,

01:05:15.639 --> 01:05:18.754
according to that person,
the hole is a quarter meter

01:05:18.754 --> 01:05:20.969
long and the rod is one meter
long?

01:05:20.969 --> 01:05:24.367
Well, I should--for it to fall,
you've got to give it a little

01:05:24.367 --> 01:05:26.930
tilt, okay, so that it can
actually fall in.

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:31.462
I give it a little here.
How can this object fall into

01:05:31.462 --> 01:05:34.412
that?
The way other person explains

01:05:34.412 --> 01:05:38.280
it is, he said first,
this end went in here.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.911
Other end was sticking way out.
Sometime later,

01:05:41.911 --> 01:05:46.039
the second end went in here.
That's how we got to the hole.

01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:48.260
Namely, the two ends did not go
at the same time.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:52.035
That way, it's certainly
possible for a one-meter stick

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:55.180
to go through a
quarter-centimeter hole in the

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.962
table.
I mean, give the rod a little

01:05:56.962 --> 01:05:58.270
tilt so it can fall into the
hole.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:01.394
The tip enters first;
the tail is way outside but

01:06:01.394 --> 01:06:04.520
after a while the tail goes in
and in that manner;

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.940
the rod goes in.
So, they can reconcile this

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:12.320
paradox by saying the two ends
did not go at the same time.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.159
Also, if you ask the other
person who thinks something is

01:06:16.159 --> 01:06:20.272
two meters long and the other
person thinks it's half a meter

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:22.809
long,
how did they reconcile it?

01:06:22.809 --> 01:06:25.748
I say, I measure the two ends
at the same time but you will

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.687
tell me, "You did not measure
the ends of my meter stick at

01:06:28.687 --> 01:06:30.781
the same time.
You measured one end and you

01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:33.230
goofed off and you came back and
measured the second end.

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.440
By the time the rod had slipped
to the right,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.599
you measured that end and you
goofed off.

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:40.385
You waited until it came there
and then you measured the other

01:06:40.385 --> 01:06:43.046
end.
That's where you got half

01:06:43.046 --> 01:06:47.179
instead of one."
And nobody is right or wrong.

01:06:47.179 --> 01:06:49.902
I did measure the two ends
simultaneously according to me

01:06:49.902 --> 01:06:52.480
but you don't have to agree they
were simultaneous.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.877
So, it's by going soft on what
simultaneity means that you are

01:06:57.877 --> 01:07:01.144
able to reconcile this.
Because in Newtonian days,

01:07:01.144 --> 01:07:03.460
simultaneity is absolute;
length is absolute.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.848
In relativity,
simultaneity is relative and

01:07:05.848 --> 01:07:09.373
length is also relative because
the operational way to find the

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:12.329
length of a body will not
satisfy all observers.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:14.608
If I find the length of your
moving meter stick,

01:07:14.608 --> 01:07:17.572
the two ends at the same time,
you will say I didn't measure

01:07:17.572 --> 01:07:20.350
them at the same time and the
formulas relative will allow

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.679
that.
That's how we live with the

01:07:22.679 --> 01:07:27.131
fact that we accuse each other
of having relatively short meter

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:28.910
sticks.
I blame you on your

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.315
measurement, but that blame is
not a genuine blame because you

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:35.496
can dig a hole equal to the
reduced length and things will

01:07:35.496 --> 01:07:37.813
be falling.
So, you have every right to say

01:07:37.813 --> 01:07:40.199
things are shorter,
and I will say I didn't shrink;

01:07:40.199 --> 01:07:43.013
I fell in because my nose went
in first and then a little later

01:07:43.013 --> 01:07:46.090
the tail went.
There are various paradoxes.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.380
I'll just leave you with one.
You have a garage.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.200
Your parents built you a
garage, 12 meters long.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.460
You bought a car 14 meters long.
Can you park it?

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.432
Well, if you go at sufficiently
high velocities,

01:07:57.432 --> 01:08:00.759
so the 14 gets shrunk to 12,
there will be a brief instant

01:08:00.759 --> 01:08:03.420
in which both ends of your car
are inside the garage.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.103
Of course, you will have to
smash through the back end of

01:08:06.103 --> 01:08:07.780
the garage but you will
maintain,

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.005
"Yes, I smashed into that but
my car was in the garage for

01:08:11.005 --> 01:08:13.099
some time" and the parent will
say,

01:08:13.099 --> 01:08:15.510
no, the front end went in and
smashed the rear.

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.630
The back hadn't even come in.
A little later the back came.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:20.762
So, everyone will agree you
broke the garage,

01:08:20.762 --> 01:08:23.040
you broke the car,
and the lengths will contract

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.045
relatively to each other and the
phenomena is that according to

01:08:26.045 --> 01:08:27.673
you,
there was a time the whole car

01:08:27.673 --> 01:08:29.466
was in the garage,
that according to the parents

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:30.466
it was not.

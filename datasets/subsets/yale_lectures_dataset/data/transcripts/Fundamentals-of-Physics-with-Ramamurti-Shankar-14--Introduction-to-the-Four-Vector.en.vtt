00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.912
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Let me remind you

00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:10.254
that everything I did so far in
class came from analyzing the

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:14.104
Lorentz transformations.
And you guys should be really

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:17.941
on top of those two marvelous
equations, because all the stuff

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.520
we are doing is a consequence of
that.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
I won't go over how we derive
them, because I've done it more

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.042
than once.
But I remind you that if you've

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:31.290
got an event that occurs at x,t
for one person,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:40.337
and to a person moving to the
right, at velocity u,

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:47.798
the same event will have
coordinates x' = x -

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:55.100
ut/√ and t^(') = (t -
ux/C^(2))/√.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.420
This is it.
This is the key.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.863
From this, by taking
differences of two events,

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:05.280
you can get similar equations
for coordinate differences.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.176
In other words,
if two events are separated in

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:13.766
space by Δx for one
person and Δx' for

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.230
another person and likewise in
time,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.739
then you get similar formula
for differences.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:24.744
So, differences are related the
same way that coordinates

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:28.195
themselves are.
But I will write it anyway,

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:33.330
because I will use it sometimes
one way and sometimes the other

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.897
way.
Even this one you can think of

00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:39.873
as a formula for a difference,
except one of the coordinates,

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:42.321
or the origin.
This isn't generally,

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.910
if you've got two events,
not necessarily at the origin,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.617
then there's spatial separation
and time separation are

00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:53.849
connected in this fashion.
So, I put this to work.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:55.650
I got a lot of consequences
from that.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.345
You remember that?
For example,

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:05.879
I said, take a clock that you
are carrying with you.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.853
Or let's take a clock that I'm
carrying with me and let's see

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:13.435
how it looks to you.
And let's say it goes tick and

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:17.762
it goes tick one more time.
So for me, the time difference

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:21.980
between the two ticks will be,
let's say, one second.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.498
It's a one-second clock.
The space difference is zero

00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:29.009
because the clock is not going
anywhere for me.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.529
So for you, Δt' =
1s/√ which is more than

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.400
one second.
So you will say,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.711
hey, the time your clock ticked
one second, I really claimed two

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:41.418
seconds have passed.
Therefore, you will say my

00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:44.093
clocks are running slow.
And it's easy to see,

00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:47.205
from the same equations,
that if you replace the prime

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.730
and unprimed ones,
simply change u to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.259
-u, nothing changes.
The clock that you think is set

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.759
best with respect to you will
look slow to me.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.639
Then, I showed you how when you
wanted to measure the length of

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.629
a stick which is traveling past
you,

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.125
you get your assistants on
the--who are all lined up on the

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.199
x axis to measure the two
ends of the rod,

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.690
or any particular time they
like.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.672
Take the special difference.
That's the meaning of the

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:18.498
length of a moving rod.
You've got to measure both ends

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.935
at the same time.
So, you make sure the two

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.960
measurements are done at the
same time, so Δt = 0.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.936
The distance between them is
what I call the length of the

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:30.060
rod.
You are moving with the rod.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.794
And as long as you're moving
with the rod,

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:36.262
the rod has got two points
which are separated by the

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:39.021
length L_0.
And one thing occurs at one

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:40.800
end, another thing occurs at the
other end.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.801
The spatial difference between
them will be simply the length

00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.470
of the rod in your frame of
reference.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.037
So, l will be
L_0 times--if

00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:52.400
you bring the square root to the
other side,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.092
L will be
L_0√ whereas

00:03:56.092 --> 00:04:00.570
Δt' would be some
Δτ under this frame,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.700
divided by the square root.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.045
Okay.
Now, the important result I

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:10.350
showed you was a lack of
simultaneity.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.017
It's not absolute.
So, I started with unfortunate

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:20.589
example of twins born in Los
Angeles and New York,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.810
and you guys were pointing out
that no normal woman could do

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.970
that, except the one from "your
momma" jokes.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.748
"Your momma" jokes;
your momma is so big she can

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:38.187
have a kid in New York.
So, I don't want to deal with

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:40.889
such cosmological objects right
now.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.500
So, I will say,
pick a better example.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.995
Two things happen.
Something here,

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.930
something there,
separated by distance.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.769
People cannot agree that they
were simultaneous.

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:54.924
Now, you've got to say,
it is very surprising,

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:59.269
people cannot agree on length
difference between two events.

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:01.590
For example,
New York and Los Angeles;

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.040
over 3000 miles apart.
We think you can move in a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.449
train;
you can move in a plane.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.189
You all have to agree on the
separation, but you don't.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.120
That's just a consequence of
now the new relativity.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.777
In the old days,
before I did relativity,

00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:18.166
I was taking just the good old
x and y

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:20.686
coordinates.
And I said you can take a

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.950
point, you can assign to it some
coordinates x and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.003
y.
Then, somebody comes along with

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:30.495
a rotated axis,
but no one seems to be troubled

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:34.746
by the fact that the same point
is now given a new set of

00:05:34.746 --> 00:05:41.529
coordinates by this new person.
Or take a pair of points on

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.431
this line.
For that person in the rotated

00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.709
system, these events have the
same y' coordinate.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.860
Because you see,
this is the y '= 0 axis.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.855
It occurred at the same
y', but for me,

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.383
they're not the same y
coordinate, because that has

00:05:57.383 --> 00:05:59.881
that y coordinate;
that's a different y

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:01.943
coordinate.
So, we are fully used to the

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:04.773
fact that having the same
x coordinate for two

00:06:04.773 --> 00:06:07.603
events is not an absolute
statement difference on the

00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:10.089
frame of reference.
Having the same y

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.759
coordinates is also not
absolute.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.864
But somehow,
in the case of time,

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:17.416
we used to think that time
differences are absolute and

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:19.850
spatial differences are
absolute.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.995
And what we are learning is no,
they are just like the x

00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:27.290
and the y.
Okay.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.372
So, I'm going to do one more
thing with the Lorentz

00:06:30.372 --> 00:06:32.759
transformation.
This is pretty interesting.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.300
Let's take this equation for
time difference;

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:45.020
Δt' = Δt - uΔx over
c^(2) divided by this.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.820
So, let's take two events.
First, something happens;

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.396
then, something else happens.
And Δt is a separation

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:57.096
in time between them,
t_2 -

00:06:57.096 --> 00:06:59.553
t_1.
Let's say t_2 -

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.560
t_1 is positive,
so t_2,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.552
the second event,
occurred after the first event,

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:08.810
according to me.
How about according to you?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.133
Well, Δt' doesn't have
to have the same sign as

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:15.087
Δt, because you can
subtract this number,

00:07:15.087 --> 00:07:18.863
uΔx over c^(2);
Δx can be whatever you

00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:23.663
like.
Therefore, you can find that

00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:29.879
Δt' could be negative
for you.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:33.709
And you've got to understand,
that's a big deal.

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:36.050
I say this happened first and
that happened later.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.756
Then, you say,
no, it happened the opposite

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.888
way.
Now, this can lead to serious

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:46.168
logical contradictions,
especially if event one is the

00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:50.373
cause of event two.
This is a standard example both

00:07:50.373 --> 00:07:53.555
in special and general
relativity that people talk

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:57.339
about;
event one is somebody's

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:01.456
grandmother is born.
And event two,

00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:04.920
that person is born.
We say the birth of the kid

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.074
takes place long after the birth
of the grandmother,

00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:11.293
according to me.
What if, in some other point of

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:14.722
view, the kid is born,
but the grandmother is not yet

00:08:14.722 --> 00:08:17.350
born.
And somebody goes and

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.080
assassinates the grandmother.
This is--In fact,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.800
this is called killing the
grandmother.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.970
These words are taken right out
of textbooks.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.644
Why this kind of violence is
inflicted on grandmothers I

00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:31.449
don't know, but it's a standard
example.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.204
All logical contradictions
involving time travel have to

00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:37.010
come--have to do with coming
back and doing something.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.070
So, here's an example.
The grandchild is born.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.831
Grandmother is not yet born,
and something is done,

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.146
you know, to prevent her from
being born or two seconds after

00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:48.830
she is born,
she is hit by the mafia.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.669
How do you explain the
grandchild?

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:53.269
Where did the grandchild come
from?

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:55.850
Because the cause has been
eliminated.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.970
Or, event 1, I fired a bullet.
Event two, somebody is hit.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.751
And you go to frame of
reference in which the person

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.259
has been hit and I haven't fired
the bullet.

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:08.850
So, you come and you finish me
off.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.540
So now, we've got this person
dying for no apparent reason

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.130
because the cause has been
eliminated.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.637
That simply cannot happen.
Einstein recognized that there

00:09:18.637 --> 00:09:21.350
is a limit to how far he can
push this community,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.707
and he conceded that if
A can be the cause of

00:09:24.707 --> 00:09:28.855
B, you better not find an
observer for whom they occur in

00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:32.064
reverse order.
Because if the cause occurs

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:35.437
after the effect,
then there is some time left

00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:39.786
for somebody to prevent the
cause itself from happening and

00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:43.460
we have an effect with no
perceivable cause.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.292
So, we want to make sure that
Δt' cannot be reversed

00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:50.930
whenever the first event could
be the cause of the second

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.274
event.
So, you go and ask this

00:09:53.274 --> 00:09:57.474
equation: if Δt is
positive, when will Δt'

00:09:57.474 --> 00:10:00.980
be negative?
That is simple algebra;

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.730
you want this term to beat that
term.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.710
So, that'll happen if u,
Δx--let me put a

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.316
c here,
another c here,

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.560
is greater than Δt.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.843
If that happens,
things are going to happen

00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:23.423
backwards, right?
So, let's modify that a little

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:29.401
bit by putting this c
over here, and rewrite it

00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:35.605
finally as u over cis
bigger thancΔt over

00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:39.830
Δx.
Let's understand what this

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.202
equation means.
This equation means that if

00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:47.316
there were two events separated
in time by Δt and in

00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:50.506
space by Δx,
I can find an observer,

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:54.302
at a certain speed u,
so that u divided by

00:10:54.302 --> 00:10:56.729
c,
if it exceeds this number,

00:10:56.729 --> 00:10:59.559
for that observer,
the time order of the events

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:05.809
will be reversed.
Yeah?

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:07.571
Student:
[inaudible]

00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:11.163
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It's not yet clear

00:11:11.163 --> 00:11:14.009
the velocity is greater than
c.

00:11:14.009 --> 00:11:16.520
It depends on what's happening
in the top and bottom.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.919
You have to ask.
What is cΔt?

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:23.390
Remember, Δt is a time
between two events.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.776
cΔt is what?
It's the distance a light pulse

00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:32.539
can travel in that time.
The denominator is a spatial

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:34.519
separation between those two
events.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:36.960
Event 1 is here,
event 2 is there;

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.407
cΔt is how far a light
signal can travel in the time

00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:44.577
separating these two events.
If cΔt looks like that,

00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:49.336
then there's enough time for a
light signal to go from here to

00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:51.007
here.
In that case,

00:11:51.007 --> 00:11:54.473
cΔt would be bigger
than Δx,

00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:58.987
but then the velocity that you
want of your frame will be

00:11:58.987 --> 00:12:02.030
bigger than one,
and that's not possible in

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.330
units of speed of light.

00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:10.808
The only time you will get a
sensible value for the second

00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:15.034
frame, namely with u/c
 1 would be if cΔt

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:17.588
;
that means, here's the first

00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:19.149
event and here's the second
event.

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:22.319
A light signal could have only
gone from there to there in the

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:25.936
time between the events.
So, it is saying that if two

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:30.549
events are such that there was
not enough time for a light

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:35.163
signal to leave the first event
and arrive in time for the

00:12:35.163 --> 00:12:38.167
second event,
then we can actually find an

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:41.263
observer with the sensible
velocity for whom the order of

00:12:41.263 --> 00:12:46.406
events is reversed.
Therefore, what have we learned

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:49.649
from this?
We learned from this that it

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:53.349
should not be--if there is
enough time for a light signal

00:12:53.349 --> 00:12:56.190
to go from one event to the
other event,

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.289
then we will not play around
with the order of events.

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:01.945
But if there is no time even
for the light signal to go,

00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:04.889
the system in fact allows you
to see them in reverse order.

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.424
But we have seen that events
which are causally connected,

00:13:08.424 --> 00:13:11.960
the order cannot be reversed or
should not be reversed.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.403
So, what this is saying is,
it should be impossible for an

00:13:17.403 --> 00:13:23.037
event here to affect a second
event by using a signal faster

00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:25.281
than light.
In other words,

00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:28.366
we are going to say that if
there wasn't enough time for a

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:31.179
light signal to go from this
event to that event,

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:34.840
then this event could not have
been the cause of that event.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.632
We will demand that.
Therefore, what the theory for

00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:43.455
it to be make logical sense is,
no signal should travel faster

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:46.728
than the speed of light.
Because if you had a signal

00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:48.668
that can travel faster than the
speed of light,

00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:51.156
then the first event could have
been the cause of the second

00:13:51.156 --> 00:13:53.026
event,
because you send the signal and

00:13:53.026 --> 00:13:55.748
the signal may blow something
up, but that is not enough time

00:13:55.748 --> 00:13:57.700
for light to get there in the
same time.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.774
But if you allowed such things,
then you will find a frame of

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.695
reference with a velocity
perfectly sensible in which they

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:06.000
occur backwards,
and cause and effect will have

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.484
been reversed.
So, the answer to the whole

00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:12.173
thing, in case you're still
struggling with this issue,

00:14:12.173 --> 00:14:15.814
is the following.
What the theory of relativity

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:19.894
demands is that it should be
impossible for events to

00:14:19.894 --> 00:14:24.287
influence other events with
signals traveling faster than

00:14:24.287 --> 00:14:26.188
light.
Once you accept that,

00:14:26.188 --> 00:14:28.512
there is no logical
contradiction in the theory,

00:14:28.512 --> 00:14:31.480
because the only time events
are reversed is in when there is

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.200
no time for light signal to go
from here to there.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.973
That means there was no way
this could have been the cause

00:14:36.973 --> 00:14:38.143
of that.
For example,

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:40.990
when I fire a bullet,
the cause is my firing of the

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.350
bullet, the effect is whatever
happens to the recipient.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.218
And the whole thing takes place
at the speed equal to speed of

00:14:47.218 --> 00:14:48.626
the bullet.
In that case,

00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:51.566
cΔt is definitely
bigger than Δx,

00:14:51.566 --> 00:14:55.669
because in the time it took the
bullet to go from here to there,

00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:58.629
the light pulse could have also
gone there and beyond.

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:00.733
In that case,
you'll never find an observer

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.638
at a speed less than that of
light for whom the events will

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:06.701
appear backwards.
So, the special theory of

00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:10.964
relativity is another way to
ensure that everything is

00:15:10.964 --> 00:15:15.871
consistent is to demand that no
signal travels faster than the

00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:21.687
speed of light.
No energy, no signal can travel

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:25.076
that fast.
But this leads to something

00:15:25.076 --> 00:15:28.569
very interesting.
Our view of space-time is now

00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:31.846
modified, you see?
In the old days,

00:15:31.846 --> 00:15:37.731
here is space and here is time.
And let's say (0,0) is

00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.808
where I am right now.
I am at the origin,

00:15:40.808 --> 00:15:43.399
my clock says zero;
I'm here right now.

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:48.791
Any dot I pick here is in my
future, because t is

00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:52.980
positive for the events.
They have not happened yet.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.111
Any dot I draw here is an event
in my past, because it occurred

00:15:58.111 --> 00:16:01.715
at an earlier time.
So, in the Newtonian view of

00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:04.780
the world, there is something
called right now,

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.815
this horizontal line.
And everything above it is

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:10.457
called later or future.
Everything below it is called

00:16:10.457 --> 00:16:12.990
past.
But in special relativity,

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.512
after you've taken into account
a relativistic thing,

00:16:17.512 --> 00:16:20.730
let's draw here an axis
ct.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:26.370
So, whenever you have another
event so that ct &gt;

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:32.862
x, there is enough time for
a light signal to go from here

00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:35.412
to here.
That's the meaning of saying

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.809
ct &gt; x.
This is the line ct = x.

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:41.519
This is the line ct &gt;
x.

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:46.540
This event is in the future of
this event according to me,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.799
and also according to anybody
else.

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:52.947
In other words,
Δt is positive for me,

00:16:52.947 --> 00:16:56.864
but if you go back to these
equations, since cΔt &gt;

00:16:56.864 --> 00:17:00.572
x, you will never find
anybody who said this event

00:17:00.572 --> 00:17:03.299
occurred earlier than this
event.

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:06.061
Another way to understand it is
if I want to cause that event,

00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:08.279
suppose that is some explosion
going off there.

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:11.089
I send a signal that goes and
makes that happen.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.750
That signal has to travel
slower than light to get there.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.230
Therefore, it could have caused
the event.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.750
And therefore,
there is no screwing around

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.602
with the order of that event.
That is in my future according

00:17:23.602 --> 00:17:25.759
to me and according to all
observers.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:32.000
If you take an event here,
so this is called--this whole

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.468
event north of this 45 degree
line is called the "absolute

00:17:38.468 --> 00:17:42.094
future."
By "absolute," I mean future of

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:46.549
me not only according to me,
but according to all observers.

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:49.449
For every observer,
this will occur later than

00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:52.017
this.
It won't be later by the same

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:55.009
number of seconds,
but it will be later.

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:57.799
So, the Δt between this
event and this event is positive

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.660
for me, will be positive for all
people.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.000
They will all agree this
occurred after this;

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.980
therefore, the effect appeared
before the cause.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.690
Sorry, the cause will appear
before the effect.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:13.615
And it is not really necessary
that this event be caused by

00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:16.192
this event.
It's only necessary that it

00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:19.520
could have been caused by this
event because not everything in

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.030
the universe is caused by some
other event.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.910
It can just simply happen.
We have heard that;

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.967
stuff happens.
So, stuff happens here with no

00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:31.734
obvious cause,
as long as this in the future,

00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:33.804
according to me;
by this definition,

00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:35.829
it's in the future according to
all people.

00:18:35.829 --> 00:18:39.309
So, this is called the future
because you can affect it.

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:41.870
For example,
if I heard something terrible

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.431
is going to happen at this
point, I can send my guys to go

00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.950
over there and do something.
They have to travel at a speed

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.990
that is less than the speed of
light so they can affect it.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.299
These events are called the
"absolute past."

00:18:55.299 --> 00:18:58.371
What that means,
any event here could have been

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:02.512
the cause of what's happening to
me right now because from that

00:19:02.512 --> 00:19:04.911
event,
a signal can be sent to arrive

00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:08.490
where I am right now at a speed
less than the speed of light.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.776
This line, which is called the
light cone, is a borderline case

00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:18.552
where you can communicate from
here to here using a light

00:19:18.552 --> 00:19:20.983
signal.
So, that's also considered a

00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:23.420
future.
But what about an event here?

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.635
Suppose this distance is two
seconds times the velocity of

00:19:30.635 --> 00:19:31.080
light.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.026
That has not happened yet.
And suppose I go there and open

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:44.854
my envelope and say something
terrible is going to happen at

00:19:44.854 --> 00:19:50.060
this point.
There is nothing I can do.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.306
There's nothing I can do.
In the Newtonian days,

00:19:52.306 --> 00:19:55.263
there's something you can do.
Tell someone else to really

00:19:55.263 --> 00:19:57.319
hurry up and get there and do
something.

00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.992
But now you cannot do that
because for that someone to

00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:02.817
leave you with the instruction
to do something about this

00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:05.490
requires that person to travel
faster than light,

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.483
and that's not allowed.
So, even though you know things

00:20:08.483 --> 00:20:11.705
can happen here in the future,
and you have knowledge of the

00:20:11.705 --> 00:20:14.710
fact that someone is planning to
do something there,

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.010
you cannot get there.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.589
Okay?
That's a very important thing

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:25.740
even for people who are going to
law school.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.680
And all of you guys are not
going into physics.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.730
But suppose you're going to law
school.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.040
You've got the DNA defense,
right?

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.339
My client's DNA doesn't match.
Here's another defense.

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:39.499
If your client was accused of
doing something here,

00:20:39.499 --> 00:20:43.741
and was last seen here,
you can argue that my client

00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:48.152
was outside the light cone.
That's called outside the light

00:20:48.152 --> 00:20:50.043
cone defense,
and it's absolutely

00:20:50.043 --> 00:20:52.236
water-tight.
It's better than anything

00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:55.579
because if that event is outside
the light cone of your client,

00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:58.380
the client cannot be held
responsible, because your client

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.690
will have to send a signal
faster than light,

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.630
and that law is unbroken.

00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:07.849
So, what about the status of an
event like this?

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:12.374
The status of this event is,
I can actually find other

00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:17.582
observers moving at a speed less
than light, but for whom this

00:21:17.582 --> 00:21:21.819
event occurs before this event.
So, order of events can be

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:24.089
reversed.
But it will not lead to logical

00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:27.609
contradictions because we know
the two events are not causally

00:21:27.609 --> 00:21:29.719
connected.
So, space and time,

00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:33.940
we just divide into upper half
plane and lower half plane.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.719
The future and past,
and a tiny sliver called

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:39.309
present now divided into three
regions;

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:43.220
the absolute future that you
can affect, the absolute past

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.307
whose events can affect you,
and this is--now,

00:21:46.307 --> 00:21:48.727
it doesn't have a name.
If you want,

00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:51.187
you can call it the relative
future according to you,

00:21:51.187 --> 00:21:54.120
but I'll find somebody to whom
that occurs before this one.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.365
Okay?
That's also a consequence of

00:21:59.365 --> 00:22:02.316
the Lorentz transformation.
So, you can see that the

00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:04.650
equations are very deceptively
simple.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.861
In fact, they're a lot easier
looking than some equations with

00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:09.230
angular momentum,
right?

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.339
But the consequences are really
stupendous.

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:13.230
They all follow from that
equation.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.182
And of course,
if you invent a theory like

00:22:15.182 --> 00:22:17.372
this, you've got to make sure
that there are no

00:22:17.372 --> 00:22:18.609
contradictions,
right?

00:22:18.609 --> 00:22:20.537
Suppose you find a theory,
you're very happy with

00:22:20.537 --> 00:22:22.585
everything;
velocity of light is coming out

00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:24.529
right.
But somebody points out to you

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:26.769
that the order of events can be
reversed.

00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:29.460
And you've got to agree you'll
be in a panic because,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.530
how can I reverse the order of
events?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.790
And the theory is so beautiful;
internally, it says you can

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.930
reverse the order of events if
they could not have been

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.824
causally connected.
Where the causally connected

00:22:40.824 --> 00:22:44.282
means a signal traveling at a
speed less than light could not

00:22:44.282 --> 00:22:47.049
have gone from the first or the
second event.

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:51.530
Then, the theory does not allow
them to be--If a signal could

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.190
have gone, it allows them to be
never reversed.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.848
If a signal could not have
gone, it does say you can find

00:22:57.848 --> 00:23:00.460
people for whom events occurred
in the reverse order.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.905
Alright.
So, this is the second thing,

00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:07.730
and it's called the light cone
for the following reason.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.990
I've only shown you an x
coordinate.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.804
If we had a y coordinate
coming out of the blackboard,

00:23:12.804 --> 00:23:14.539
the surface would look like a
cone.

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:16.109
That's why we call it the light
cone.

00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:18.611
Sitting at a point in
four-dimensional space-time,

00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:20.963
there's a cone.
And all points in that forward

00:23:20.963 --> 00:23:23.039
light cone are the events you
can affect.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:25.780
All points in the backward
light cone are events that can

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.641
come and get you right now.
And the rest of the thing

00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:31.583
outside the two cones,
you cannot do anything about,

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:34.640
even though you know something
is going to happen.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.589
And they cannot do anything to
you.

00:23:36.589 --> 00:23:39.860
You open an envelope,
and it says somebody here is

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.564
planning to do something to you.
You don't have to worry,

00:23:43.564 --> 00:23:47.210
because that person cannot get
to you in the time available.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.528
Because the fastest signal is
the light signal,

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:52.840
and that won't get there.
And neither will anything else.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.716
Alright.
Now, we're going to do

00:23:56.716 --> 00:24:01.420
something which is theoretically
or mathematically very pretty.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.441
So, for those of you who like
mathematical elegance,

00:24:05.441 --> 00:24:09.619
this is certainly the best
example I can offer you,

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:12.410
because it is simple and also
rather profound.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.529
But it's completely by analogy.
The analogy is the following.

00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:21.475
We have seen that when we
rotate our axis,

00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:26.190
as I've shown there,
that the x' is not the

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.519
same as x related by this
formula.

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:35.408
And y' is also not the
same as y related by this

00:24:35.408 --> 00:24:36.210
formula.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.399
Nothing is sacred.
Coordinates of a point are not

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:45.701
sacred.
They are just dependent on who

00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:48.349
is looking at them from what
orientation.

00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:54.062
But even in this world,
we noticed that x^('2) +

00:24:54.062 --> 00:24:59.660
y'^(2) is the same as
x^(2) + x^(2).

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.264
Namely, the length of the point
connecting the origin to you,

00:25:03.264 --> 00:25:06.930
or the distance from the origin
is unaffected by rotations.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.991
This is called an invariant.
This doesn't depend on who is

00:25:11.991 --> 00:25:14.589
looking at it.
Everyone will agree on this.

00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.876
But they won't agree on
x and they won't agree on

00:25:16.876 --> 00:25:18.539
y, but they will agree on
this.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:22.486
So, it's reasonable to ask in
the relativistic case,

00:25:22.486 --> 00:25:26.509
where people cannot agree on
time coordinate or space

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:29.502
coordinate,
maybe the square of the time

00:25:29.502 --> 00:25:33.560
plus the square of the space
will be the same for two people.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.674
One can ask that question.
So, when we look at that,

00:25:37.674 --> 00:25:40.009
we'll find out that that's not
the case;

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:43.759
t^(2) + x^(2) is not
invariant.

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:46.778
But even before you do that,
you should shudder at the

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:49.170
prospect of writing something
like this.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.380
Right?
What's wrong with this?

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.608
Student:
[inaudible]

00:25:52.608 --> 00:25:54.640
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Good.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.210
Everyone's on top of the units
here.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.819
So, you cannot add t^(2) +
x^(2).

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:00.470
There is no way this can be
anything.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.569
So, we know how we have to fix
that.

00:26:02.569 --> 00:26:05.631
We've got to have either both
coordinates in space-time

00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:07.730
measured with lengths or with
time.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.170
The standard trick is to do the
following.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:15.900
Let's introduce an object with
two components.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.289
I'm going to call it X.
The first component of that is

00:26:19.289 --> 00:26:21.367
going to be called
X_1--is going

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:22.970
to be called
X_0.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.059
The second is going to be
called X_1.

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:28.173
X_0,
I mean, X_1 is

00:26:28.173 --> 00:26:32.233
just our familiar x.
X_0 is going

00:26:32.233 --> 00:26:36.400
to be essentially time,
but multiplied by c.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.859
Why do I switch from t
and x to zero and one?

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:44.797
It is just that if you want to
go back to more coordinates,

00:26:44.797 --> 00:26:47.329
if you want to bring back
y and z,

00:26:47.329 --> 00:26:50.729
then I just mention for future
use that in four dimensions you

00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:52.680
really have
X_0,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.750
X_1,
X_2 and

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.031
X_3.
That is a shorthand for

00:26:59.031 --> 00:27:03.125
X_0 and what
you and I used to call the

00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:07.037
position r of a particle.
It's just that in one

00:27:07.037 --> 00:27:10.650
dimension, the vector r
becomes a number x,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.471
and I want to call the number
X_1 because

00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:15.549
it's the first of the three
coordinates.

00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:18.126
And if you're doing super
strings, you can have ten

00:27:18.126 --> 00:27:21.013
coordinates, and one will be
X_0 and the

00:27:21.013 --> 00:27:22.920
nine will be spatial
coordinates.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.694
So, we like the numerical index
rather than letters in the

00:27:26.694 --> 00:27:29.410
alphabet because we run out of
letters.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.500
But you don't run out of these
subscripts.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.216
So, I'm writing it purposely in
many ways, because if you ever

00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:36.844
go read something or you're
involved in a lab project or the

00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:39.650
group is studying something and
you want to read the paper,

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.759
people who refer to coordinates
in space-time in many ways.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:46.975
Some will call it--Some people
like to write the X the

00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:49.095
following way;
X_1,

00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:51.085
X_2,
X_3,

00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:53.359
X_4,
but X_4 is

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.664
ct.
That's why you call that the

00:27:55.664 --> 00:27:57.578
fourth dimension.
But still, the fourth

00:27:57.578 --> 00:28:00.118
dimension, but you can either
put it at the end of that first

00:28:00.118 --> 00:28:01.769
family of three or at the
beginning.

00:28:01.769 --> 00:28:05.539
So, it's very common for people
to use either notation.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:07.539
I'm just going to call it
X_0.

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:10.219
X_0 is just
time, okay, multiplied by

00:28:10.219 --> 00:28:13.101
c so that it has units of
length and multiplying by

00:28:13.101 --> 00:28:15.924
c doesn't do anything.
Everybody agrees on what

00:28:15.924 --> 00:28:17.877
c is.
So, we're all multiplying our

00:28:17.877 --> 00:28:21.420
time coordinates by c.
Alright.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.710
So, let's ask the following
question.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.145
What does the Lorentz
transformation look like when I

00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:29.589
write it in terms of these
numbers?

00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:35.965
So, first take x' is
x - ut divided by the

00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:42.600
famous square root.
But t is not what I want;

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.130
ct is what I want.
So, I fudge it as follows;

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:53.082
I write it as (x -
u/cct)/(1 -

00:28:53.082 --> 00:28:58.259
u^(2)/c^(2)).
This I'm going to write as

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:01.218
x is now called
X_1,

00:29:01.218 --> 00:29:05.210
and I'm going to introduce a
new symbol β here.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.035
This guy is called
X_0/1 -

00:29:09.035 --> 00:29:12.190
β^(2).
But β is universal

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.462
convention for u/c.
If all the velocities are

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.609
measured as a fraction of the
velocity of light,

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:19.940
then β is a number
between zero and one.

00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:28.686
So, the final way I want to
write the Lorentz transformation

00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:32.241
for coordinate is that
X_1' =

00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:36.230
(X_1 -
βX_0)/√.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.539
So, you have to get used to
this β.

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.723
I mean, you're following nicely
what I was saying in terms of

00:29:43.723 --> 00:29:46.111
velocity u,
but you have to get used to

00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:48.829
this β.
We won't use it a whole lot,

00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:52.371
but I put it here so you can
recognize it when people refer

00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:55.730
to it in the literature,
when you go read something.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.529
What's the transformation law
for time?

00:29:58.529 --> 00:30:07.728
Remember t' = (t -
ux/c^(2))/(√1 -

00:30:07.728 --> 00:30:12.395
β^(2)).
β^(2) is clearly what's

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:15.660
sitting downstairs.
u/c is β.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.269
So, what do you think we should
do?

00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:21.150
We should multiply both sides
by c.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.778
Because if you multiply both
sides by c,

00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:26.577
put a c there,
put a c there and get

00:30:26.577 --> 00:30:28.997
rid of this one,
then you find

00:30:28.997 --> 00:30:33.222
X_0' is
(X_0 -

00:30:33.222 --> 00:30:37.840
βX_1)/(√1 -
β^(2)).

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.290
So, let me write that here.
Now, you see the relationship

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.930
with the coordinates is nice and
symmetric.

00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:53.189
If you write in terms of
x and t,

00:30:53.189 --> 00:30:55.380
the coordinates transformation
law is not quite symmetric.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.622
And that's because one has
units of length and one has

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.649
units of time.
But if you rescale your time to

00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:04.439
turn it into a length,
then the transformation laws

00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:08.987
are very simple and symmetric
between the two coordinates and

00:31:08.987 --> 00:31:11.789
space-time.
There are also the other

00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:13.687
coordinates;
the y direction,

00:31:13.687 --> 00:31:16.122
X_2' =
X_2 and in the

00:31:16.122 --> 00:31:18.017
z direction,
X_3' =

00:31:18.017 --> 00:31:20.044
X_3.
In other words,

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:23.577
the length is perpendicular to
the motion, or something you can

00:31:23.577 --> 00:31:26.395
always agree on.
One can talk and talk about why

00:31:26.395 --> 00:31:29.294
that is true.
Basically, what we are saying

00:31:29.294 --> 00:31:33.523
is, if you are zooming along,
and you drew a line that says

00:31:33.523 --> 00:31:36.950
y = 1 and originally we
agreed on it,

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.267
we will have to agree on it
even when I start moving

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:41.221
relative to you,
because you've got your own

00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:43.624
line.
And there's no reason your line

00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:47.097
should be above my line or
should be above your line or

00:31:47.097 --> 00:31:50.398
below your line.
If the lines originally agreed,

00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:54.421
there is no reason why my line
is above yours or your line is

00:31:54.421 --> 00:31:56.352
below mine,
because by symmetry,

00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:59.279
there's no reason why one
should be higher than the other.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.537
And the reason this is required
is that the two lines,

00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:05.426
which last forever,
can be compared anywhere you

00:32:05.426 --> 00:32:06.605
like.
Unlike the rods,

00:32:06.605 --> 00:32:08.600
which are running away from
each other and cannot be

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.244
compared,
the line here which says y

00:32:11.244 --> 00:32:15.069
= 3 has got to be y =
3 for both of us.

00:32:15.069 --> 00:32:17.890
So, the transverse coordinates
are not modified.

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:23.269
So, that's why I don't talk
about them too much.

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:26.720
All the interesting action is
between any one coordinate along

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.210
which the motion is taking place
and time.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:33.869
So now, let's ask ourselves
maybe X_0'^(2) +

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:38.694
X_1'^(2) is the
same as this square plus that

00:32:38.694 --> 00:32:41.511
square.
Well, let me just tell you that

00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.069
I'm not going to try something
that I know will not work.

00:32:45.069 --> 00:32:47.337
In other words,
you might think

00:32:47.337 --> 00:32:50.588
X_0'^(2) +
X_1'^(2)=X

00:32:50.588 --> 00:32:53.990
_0^(2) +
X_1^(2).

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.790
Well, that just doesn't work.
That doesn't work because

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:03.000
1/√ is not a cos
θ, and β/√ is not

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.038
a sin θ.
You cannot make them cosine and

00:33:06.038 --> 00:33:08.170
sine of something.
If you could, that'll work.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.024
But it doesn't work.
But I'll tell you what does

00:33:11.024 --> 00:33:12.317
work.
Let's take

00:33:12.317 --> 00:33:16.586
X_0'^(2) -
X_1'^(2),

00:33:16.586 --> 00:33:21.411
the square of the time
coordinate minus the square of

00:33:21.411 --> 00:33:25.029
the space coordinate with a
minus.

00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:29.166
So, let's try to do this in our
head by squaring this and

00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:32.490
subtracting it from the square
of this one.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:37.880
Downstairs, I think we all
agree you get 1 - β^(2)

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.380
because the square root is
squared.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.060
How about upstairs?
First, you've got to square

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.721
this guy, this guy will give you
X_0^(2) +

00:33:49.721 --> 00:33:53.951
β^(2)X_1^(2) -
2βX_0X

00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:57.655
_1.
From that, I should subtract

00:33:57.655 --> 00:34:00.299
the square of
X_1'^(2).

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:03.561
That'll give me
-X_1^(2) -

00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:07.767
β^(2)X_0^(2) +
2βX_0X

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:09.570
_1.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.737
Just simple algebra.
And these cross terms cancel

00:34:17.737 --> 00:34:19.862
out.
And you notice I got an

00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:24.417
X_0^(2)(1 -
β^(2)) -X_1^(2)(1

00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:26.369
- β^(2)),
right?

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:28.362
This algebra,
I trust you guys can do at

00:34:28.362 --> 00:34:30.113
home.
And the result of this is going

00:34:30.113 --> 00:34:32.450
to be X_0^(2) -
X_1^(2).

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.436
That's very nice.
It says that even though people

00:34:41.436 --> 00:34:45.190
cannot agree on the time or
space coordinate of an event,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.208
just like saying people cannot
agree on what is X and

00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:50.633
what is Y,
they can agree on this

00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:54.070
quadratic function you form out
of the coordinates.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.436
But it's very different from
ordinary rotations,

00:34:56.436 --> 00:34:58.449
where you take the sum of the
squares;

00:34:58.449 --> 00:35:01.050
here you've got to take the
difference of the squares.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.635
And that's just the way it is.
Even though time is like

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:08.531
another coordinate that mixes
with space, it's not quite the

00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:10.304
same.
In other words,

00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:14.288
if I brought back all the
transverse coordinates,

00:35:14.288 --> 00:35:17.691
then you will find
X_0'^(2) -

00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:21.010
X_1'^(2) -
X_2'^(2) -

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.247
X_3'^(2) =
X_0^(2) -

00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:27.401
X_1^(2) -
X_2^(2) -

00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:30.912
X_3^(2).
This you can do because

00:35:30.912 --> 00:35:32.423
X_1'
individually is equal to

00:35:32.423 --> 00:35:34.637
X_1.
So, you can put them on both

00:35:34.637 --> 00:35:36.224
sides.
This is the actual

00:35:36.224 --> 00:35:40.201
four-dimensional result for
people who really want to leave

00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:43.081
the x axis and move
freely in space,

00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:46.449
which you're allowed to.
This is the invariant.

00:35:46.449 --> 00:35:48.690
This is the object that
everyone agrees on.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.429
Allow me once again to drop
this.

00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:56.293
Most of the time,
I'm not going to worry about

00:35:56.293 --> 00:36:00.406
transverse coordinates.
So, this is the analogue of the

00:36:00.406 --> 00:36:03.958
length square of a vector,
and it's called the space-time

00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:08.550
interval.
It's not the space interval;

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.974
it's not the time interval.
It's a space-time interval

00:36:10.974 --> 00:36:12.990
between the origin and the point
(x,t).

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.763
And this is denoted by the
symbol--there's no universal

00:36:20.763 --> 00:36:23.869
formula, but let's use
s^(2) for space-time

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:24.820
separation.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.478
Notice that even though it's
called s^(2),

00:36:31.478 --> 00:36:34.050
s^(2) need not be always
positive, definite.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.975
You can take two events,
but if the time coordinate is

00:36:37.975 --> 00:36:41.159
the same, or the time coordinate
is zero,

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:43.639
the space coordinate is not
zero, then s^(2) will be

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:46.050
negative.
Whereas the usual Pythagoras

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.614
length square,
x^(2) + y^(2) is

00:36:48.614 --> 00:36:50.984
positive definite,
always positive,

00:36:50.984 --> 00:36:54.469
the space-time interval can be
positive or negative or zero.

00:36:54.469 --> 00:36:58.487
It's positive if
X_0 can beat

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:01.969
the sum of the squares of those
guys.

00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:04.463
It's negative if they can beat
X_0 and it's

00:37:04.463 --> 00:37:06.407
equal to zero if
X_0^(2) equal

00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:07.210
to that square.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.832
So, if you want,
if you go back to this diagram

00:37:15.832 --> 00:37:20.550
I drew here, this is
X_1.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.910
This is X_0 =
ct.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.570
These are events for which
s^(2) is positive.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.079
These are also events for which
s^(2) is positive.

00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:33.510
These are events for which
s^(2) is negative.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.340
These are events in which
s^(2) is zero.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.444
So, whenever s^(2) is
positive, we have a name for

00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:47.497
that.
It's called a time-like

00:37:47.497 --> 00:37:50.829
separation.
Well, it's called time-like

00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:54.049
separation because the time-part
of the separation squared is

00:37:54.049 --> 00:37:56.679
able to beat the space-part of
the separation.

00:37:56.679 --> 00:37:58.840
It's got more time component
than space component.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.699
Now, you can also do the
following.

00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:06.940
Let me introduce some rotation
now.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:13.615
Let us agree that we will use
X for a space-time with

00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:18.857
what's called a four-vector.
A four-vector has got four

00:38:18.857 --> 00:38:20.801
components.
And the components are

00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:23.480
X_0,
and since I'm tired of writing,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.684
X_1,
X_2,

00:38:24.684 --> 00:38:26.060
X_3,
I will call it r.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.335
So, in the special theory of
relativity, what you do is,

00:38:33.335 --> 00:38:37.175
you take the three components
of space and add one more of

00:38:37.175 --> 00:38:40.409
time and form a vector with four
components.

00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:44.687
And we will agree that the note
symbol for a space-time vector

00:38:44.687 --> 00:38:47.123
is an X.
Now, I've been careless in my

00:38:47.123 --> 00:38:48.753
writing.
Sometimes I use x and

00:38:48.753 --> 00:38:51.239
X, but you guys should be
a little more careful.

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:53.545
X like this,
but no subscript,

00:38:53.545 --> 00:38:55.850
will stand for these four
numbers.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.630
It is a four-vector.
It's a four-vector;

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.760
it's a vector living in
space-time.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.015
And when you've got another
frame of reference,

00:39:03.015 --> 00:39:05.809
the components of four-vector
will mix with each other.

00:39:05.809 --> 00:39:09.050
Then, we're going to define a
dot product.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.639
It's going to be a funny dot
product.

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:17.849
It's going to be called
X∙X.

00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:21.090
Usual dot product was some of
the squares of the components.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.292
But this funny dot product will
be equal to

00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:28.944
X_0^(2) minus
the length of the spatial part,

00:39:28.944 --> 00:39:30.283
squared.
Student:

00:39:30.283 --> 00:39:31.215
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:39:31.215 --> 00:39:32.686
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student:

00:39:32.686 --> 00:39:34.287
Is that a small x?
Professor Ramamurti

00:39:34.287 --> 00:39:35.320
Shankar: This is an
X.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.226
These are all small.
X is the name for a

00:39:39.226 --> 00:39:43.368
vector with four components.
It's a position vector in

00:39:43.368 --> 00:39:46.412
space-time.
These are--This is the same as

00:39:46.412 --> 00:39:50.091
writing X_0^(2) -
X_1^(2) -

00:39:50.091 --> 00:39:53.470
X_2^(2) -
X_3^(2).

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.615
Suppose there are two events.
One occurs at the space-time

00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:03.435
coordinate X.
The second event occurs at a

00:40:03.435 --> 00:40:06.159
new point, let me call it
X_bar,

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:08.472
whose time coordinate
X_0bar,

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:10.989
whose position coordinate,
this is unfortunate,

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:13.190
vector r with a bar on
it.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.809
These are like two vectors in
the x,y plane.

00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:21.031
You and I, if we are going
relative to each other,

00:40:21.031 --> 00:40:23.117
will not agree on the
components of this or the

00:40:23.117 --> 00:40:27.239
components of that.
But we will agree on

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:30.538
X∙X'.
In other words,

00:40:30.538 --> 00:40:34.690
X∙X will be the same
as X'∙X_bar'.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.937
What I'm saying is,
if we go to a moving frame of

00:40:41.937 --> 00:40:46.114
reference, the components of the
vector X goes into

00:40:46.114 --> 00:40:48.756
X',
whose components are

00:40:48.756 --> 00:40:52.150
X_0' and some
r'.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.928
And likewise,
the vector

00:40:53.928 --> 00:40:57.329
X_bar has new
components;

00:40:57.329 --> 00:41:00.139
X_bar',
which are

00:41:00.139 --> 00:41:05.163
X_0bar' and
r_bar'.

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:07.525
Look,
it's a story as the same like

00:41:07.525 --> 00:41:10.688
in two dimensions.
Components of vectors are

00:41:10.688 --> 00:41:12.920
arbitrary.
They vary with the frame of

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.199
reference.
But the dot product of vectors

00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:18.000
is the same no matter how you
rotate your axis,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.414
because the dot product is
length of A times length

00:41:20.414 --> 00:41:22.659
of B times cosine of the
angle between them.

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:25.268
None of the three things
changes when you rotate your

00:41:25.268 --> 00:41:27.236
axis.
Well, this is the analogue of

00:41:27.236 --> 00:41:30.523
the dot product in space-time
because this is the guy that's

00:41:30.523 --> 00:41:32.813
same for everybody.
You can say,

00:41:32.813 --> 00:41:36.360
"Why don't you study this
combination?"

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.940
It's so nice.
All pluses.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.876
I like that.
I don't study that because that

00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:44.597
combination is not special.
If I have one value for the

00:41:44.597 --> 00:41:46.879
combination, you will have a
different value for the

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:49.130
combination.
There's nothing privileged.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.599
It's the one with the minus
signs in it that has the

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:54.360
privileged role of playing the
role of the dot product.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.680
So, space-time is not Euclidean.
Euclidean space is the space in

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.945
which we live,
and distance squared is the sum

00:42:00.945 --> 00:42:03.010
of the squares of all the
coordinates.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.625
So, it's a pseudo-Euclidean
space in which to find the

00:42:05.625 --> 00:42:07.698
invariant length,
you've got to square some

00:42:07.698 --> 00:42:10.511
components and subtract from
them the square of some other

00:42:10.511 --> 00:42:11.350
components.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.997
Okay.
So, finally,

00:42:18.997 --> 00:42:23.922
if you take a difference
vector, in other words,

00:42:23.922 --> 00:42:27.800
take the difference of two
events,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.605
then the spatial coordinate
according to me,

00:42:31.605 --> 00:42:34.880
the difference in space
coordinate,

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:48.626
namely, cΔt^(2) -
Δx^(2) will be cΔt' -

00:42:48.626 --> 00:42:54.440
Δx'^(2).
Or if you like,

00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:00.459
X_0^(2) -
X_1^(2) will be

00:43:00.459 --> 00:43:06.360
X_0'^(2) -
X_1'^(2).

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.413
I'm using the notations back
and forth so you get used to

00:43:09.413 --> 00:43:12.139
writing the space-time
coordinates in two different

00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:13.919
ways.
So, it not only works for

00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:16.240
coordinates, but for coordinate
differences.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.269
You understand?
Two events occur,

00:43:18.269 --> 00:43:20.730
one here now and one there
later;

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.639
let's say they are separated in
time by two meters.

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:27.066
They are separated in space by
two meters and time by 11

00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:30.030
seconds.
I'm sorry.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.717
I didn't mean to write this.
I meant to write

00:43:33.717 --> 00:43:39.840
ΔX_0^(2) -
ΔX_1^(2) =

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:46.780
ΔX_0'^(2) -
ΔX_1'^(2).

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.510
So, do you guys follow the
meaning of this statement?

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.634
Most things are relative.
Distance between events --

00:44:00.634 --> 00:44:02.595
relative.
Time interval between events --

00:44:02.595 --> 00:44:05.775
relative.
But this combination is somehow

00:44:05.775 --> 00:44:08.340
invariant.
Everybody agrees on what it is.

00:44:12.769 --> 00:44:15.520
Now, we are going to understand
the space-time interval.

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:24.331
Δs^(2) is a name for a
small or a space-time interval

00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:28.352
formed under differences.
Now, we are going to apply this

00:44:28.352 --> 00:44:32.288
to the following problem.
I'm going to give you a feeling

00:44:32.288 --> 00:44:36.263
for what space-time interval
means when applied to the study

00:44:36.263 --> 00:44:38.878
of a single particle.
So previously,

00:44:38.878 --> 00:44:43.227
Δx and Δt were
separations between two random,

00:44:43.227 --> 00:44:46.079
unrelated events or arbitrary
events.

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:49.030
But now I want you to consider
the following event.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.760
Here is a particle in
space-time.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.343
And it moves there.
This is where it is in the

00:44:55.343 --> 00:44:57.949
beginning, that's where it is at
the end.

00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:06.078
So now, I want Δx to be
the distance the particle

00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:07.530
travels.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:17.770
And I want Δt to be the
time in which it did this.

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:26.469
So, these are two events in the
life of a particle.

00:45:26.469 --> 00:45:28.909
Two events lying on the
trajectory of a particle.

00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:30.784
In the x,t plane,
you draw a line,

00:45:30.784 --> 00:45:32.658
it's a trajectory,
because at every time,

00:45:32.658 --> 00:45:34.860
there's an x,
and that describes particle

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.614
motion.
And this is the Δx and

00:45:38.614 --> 00:45:43.163
this is the Δt.
Let's look at the space-time

00:45:43.163 --> 00:45:49.690
interval between the two events.
Δs^(2) will be

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:54.760
cΔt^(2) - Δx^(2).

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.219
But we're going to rewrite this
as follows.

00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:12.372
Equal to cCΔt^(2)[1
- (v^(2)/c^(2))] where

00:46:12.372 --> 00:46:17.630
v is Δx/Δt.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.032
Because these are two events in
the life of a particle,

00:46:23.032 --> 00:46:25.222
the distance over time is
actually the velocity of the

00:46:25.222 --> 00:46:25.760
particle.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.821
I have always used v for
the velocity of a particle that

00:46:31.821 --> 00:46:34.089
I'm looking at,
and u for the velocity

00:46:34.089 --> 00:46:37.094
difference between my frame of
reference and your frame of

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.922
reference.
So, u is always the

00:46:38.922 --> 00:46:42.149
speed between frames.
And v is the speed of

00:46:42.149 --> 00:46:47.409
some particle I'm looking at.
So, let's take the square root

00:46:47.409 --> 00:46:50.628
of both sides,
and we find Δs =

00:46:50.628 --> 00:46:54.510
cΔt√[1 -
(v^(2)/c^(2))].

00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:03.636
So, the space-time interval
between two events in the life

00:47:03.636 --> 00:47:07.892
of a particle is c times
the time difference times this

00:47:07.892 --> 00:47:12.391
factor.
Now, this is supposed to be an

00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.320
invariant.
By that I mean no matter who

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.441
calculates this space-time
interval, that person is going

00:47:18.441 --> 00:47:21.558
to get the same answer.
So, let's calculate the

00:47:21.558 --> 00:47:25.619
space-time interval as computed
by the particle itself.

00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:28.750
What does the particle think
happens?

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.672
Well, the particle says,
in other words,

00:47:31.672 --> 00:47:34.219
you're riding with the
particle.

00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:38.378
So, in your frame of reference,
for the particle,

00:47:38.378 --> 00:47:43.057
now, the time difference
between the two events--let me

00:47:43.057 --> 00:47:47.910
call this one Δτ. And
the space difference?

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:54.200
What's the space difference
between the two events?

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.385
Yeah?
Student:

00:47:55.385 --> 00:47:56.188
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:56.188 --> 00:47:58.570
Shankar: Zero.
Because as far as the particle

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.440
is concerned,
I'm still here.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.412
If I'm moving,
from my vantage,

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:05.963
my x coordinates,
wherever I chose to put in the

00:48:05.963 --> 00:48:09.119
beginning, and that's where
it'll follow me.

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.025
So the two events,
particle sighted here and

00:48:11.025 --> 00:48:13.063
particle sighted there,
have different x

00:48:13.063 --> 00:48:15.809
coordinates for the person to
whom the particle is moving.

00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:18.088
But if you're co-moving with
the particle,

00:48:18.088 --> 00:48:21.590
then your x coordinate
as seen by you does not change.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:25.721
Therefore, Δx is zero.
Therefore, the space-time

00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:30.050
interval would be simply
cΔτ where τ is the

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.380
time measured by a clock going
with the particle.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:44.650
So, Δτ is the time in
particle's frame.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.079
In other words,
if the particle had its own

00:48:48.079 --> 00:48:53.061
clock, that's the time it will
say has elapsed between the two

00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:56.356
points in its trajectory.
So, it's not so hard to

00:48:56.356 --> 00:48:57.849
understand.
See, I am the particle.

00:48:57.849 --> 00:49:01.073
I'm moving, looking at my
watch, and I'm saying that time

00:49:01.073 --> 00:49:02.570
will pass for me,
right?

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.260
One second and two second;
that's the time according to me.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.821
If you guys see me,
you will disagree with me on

00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:10.219
how far I moved and how much
time it took.

00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:12.059
That's your Δx and your
Δt.

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:14.530
But for me, there's only
Δτ.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.199
There's no Δx for me.
So, the space-time interval,

00:49:18.199 --> 00:49:21.805
when you describe particle
behavior, is essentially the

00:49:21.805 --> 00:49:24.610
time elapsed according to the
particle.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:29.710
So, it's not hard to understand
why everybody agrees on that.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.021
See, you and I don't have to
agree on how much time elapsed

00:49:33.021 --> 00:49:36.389
between when the particle was
here and when it was there.

00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:38.995
But if we ask,
how much time elapsed according

00:49:38.995 --> 00:49:41.427
to the particle,
we are all asking the same

00:49:41.427 --> 00:49:43.885
question.
That's why we all get the same

00:49:43.885 --> 00:49:45.967
answer.
The space-time interval is

00:49:45.967 --> 00:49:50.942
called the proper time.
So, proper time is another name

00:49:50.942 --> 00:49:58.000
for the time as measured by a
clock carried with the particle.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.934
S,o let's write it this way.
The space time interval is

00:50:01.934 --> 00:50:06.214
really cΔτ.
And Δτ is also an

00:50:06.214 --> 00:50:08.349
invariant.
Namely, everyone agrees on

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.850
Δτ.

00:50:13.519 --> 00:50:16.659
And what's the relation between
Δt and Δτ?

00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:20.590
Δt is the time
according to any old person.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.590
And Δτ is the time
according to the clock.

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:33.772
And you saw that the space-time
interval, cΔτ was equal

00:50:33.772 --> 00:50:41.760
to Δt√[1 -
(v^(2)/c^(2))].

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.296
So, we are going to--I'm sorry,
the c cancels on both

00:50:44.296 --> 00:50:45.870
sides.
This is the relation.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:58.356
So, I will be using the fact
that dτ/dt = √[1 -

00:50:58.356 --> 00:51:05.766
(v^(2)/c^(2))] or dt/dτ
= 1/√[1 -

00:51:05.766 --> 00:51:09.835
(v^(2)/c^(2))].
In other words,

00:51:09.835 --> 00:51:13.320
the time elapsed between two
events in the life of a

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.976
particle,
as seen by an observer for whom

00:51:15.976 --> 00:51:18.820
it has a velocity,
compared to as seen by a clock

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.820
moving with the particle,
that ratio is given by this.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.949
As the particle speeds up,
let's see if it makes sense.

00:51:26.949 --> 00:51:29.304
As v approaches
c, this number approaches

00:51:29.304 --> 00:51:31.129
zero.
That means you can say it

00:51:31.129 --> 00:51:34.289
took--the particle has been
traveling for 30 hours,

00:51:34.289 --> 00:51:36.812
but with this number almost
vanishing, the particle would

00:51:36.812 --> 00:51:39.020
say, I've been traveling for a
very short time.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.876
That's the way it is.
The particle will always think

00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:43.928
it took less time to go from
here to there,

00:51:43.928 --> 00:51:46.888
compared to any other observer,
because the clock runs fastest

00:51:46.888 --> 00:51:47.840
in its own rest rate.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.440
Okay.
Now, this is the new variable

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.050
I'm going to use to develop the
next step.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.099
The next step is the following;
in Newtonian mechanics,

00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:02.460
particles have a position
x and maybe y and

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.982
z.
But let me just say x.

00:52:04.982 --> 00:52:07.678
Let me take one more.
It had x and it had

00:52:07.678 --> 00:52:10.587
y.
And these were varying with

00:52:10.587 --> 00:52:11.120
time.

00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:22.313
Then, I formed a vector
r, which is ix +

00:52:22.313 --> 00:52:24.807
jy.
And the vector is

00:52:24.807 --> 00:52:28.957
mathematically defined as an
entity with two components so

00:52:28.957 --> 00:52:32.532
that when you rotate the axis,
the components go into

00:52:32.532 --> 00:52:35.357
x' and y',
which are related to x

00:52:35.357 --> 00:52:37.370
and y,
but they're cos and

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.690
sin θ.
That's defined to be a vector.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.932
Now, if I went to you and said,
okay, that's one vector,

00:52:43.932 --> 00:52:48.360
the position vector.
Can you point to me another

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.066
vector?
Anybody know other vectors in

00:52:51.066 --> 00:52:54.519
Newtonian mechanics?
Yes sir?

00:52:54.519 --> 00:52:58.852
You don't know any other
vectors in the good old

00:52:58.852 --> 00:53:01.710
mechanics days?
The only vector you've seen is

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.239
position?
Student: Velocity is one.

00:53:04.239 --> 00:53:04.810
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Very good.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:06.050
Yeah.
That's right.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.620
You're right.
You certainly know the answers.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.016
So, you shouldn't hesitate.
So, how do you get to velocity

00:53:11.016 --> 00:53:12.588
from position?
Student:

00:53:12.588 --> 00:53:14.197
Take the derivative.
Professor Ramamurti

00:53:14.197 --> 00:53:14.780
Shankar: You take the
derivative.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.662
So, you've got to ask yourself;
why does the act of taking

00:53:17.662 --> 00:53:20.640
derivative off a vector produce
another vector?

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.454
Well, what's the derivative?
You change the guy by some

00:53:24.454 --> 00:53:26.820
Δ, and you divide it by
the time.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.550
Now, change in the vector is
obviously a vector,

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.340
because difference of two
vectors is a vector.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.766
Dividing by time is like
multiplying by the reciprocal of

00:53:35.766 --> 00:53:37.709
the time.
That's like multiplying by

00:53:37.709 --> 00:53:39.435
number.
And I've told you multiplying a

00:53:39.435 --> 00:53:41.330
vector by a number also gives
you a vector;

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:44.768
maybe longer or shorter.
Therefore, Δr is a

00:53:44.768 --> 00:53:48.472
vector because it's the
difference of r later

00:53:48.472 --> 00:53:51.775
minus r now,
dividing by Δt is the

00:53:51.775 --> 00:53:55.010
same as multiplying by 10,000 or
100,000 or 1 million.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:56.820
It doesn't matter.
That's also a vector.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.116
And the limit is also a vector.
Therefore, when you take a

00:53:59.116 --> 00:54:00.920
derivative of a vector,
you get a vector.

00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:07.406
And then you can--Once you got
this derivative,

00:54:07.406 --> 00:54:09.519
it becomes addictive.
You can take second derivatives.

00:54:09.519 --> 00:54:11.280
As you said,
you can have acceleration.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.482
Then you can get--you can take
the acceleration,

00:54:14.482 --> 00:54:18.739
multiply a mass by a mass.
Now, that is called a scalar.

00:54:18.739 --> 00:54:22.237
The mass of particle is a
number that everyone will agree

00:54:22.237 --> 00:54:24.809
on.
It has no direction.

00:54:24.809 --> 00:54:28.324
So, the product of a number and
a vector is another vector,

00:54:28.324 --> 00:54:30.929
and that vector,
of course, is the force.

00:54:30.929 --> 00:54:34.620
So derivatives of vectors and
multiples of vectors by scalars,

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.250
namely things that don't change
when you rotate your axis,

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:42.506
are ways to generate vectors.
So what I want to do is,

00:54:42.506 --> 00:54:45.320
I want to generate more
vectors.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.946
The only four-vector I have is
the position four-vector,

00:54:49.946 --> 00:54:52.469
which is this guy,
X,

00:54:52.469 --> 00:54:55.746
whose components I write for
you again are

00:54:55.746 --> 00:54:59.183
X_0,
which is code name for

00:54:59.183 --> 00:55:02.300
ct and
X_1,

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.345
which is code name for x.
And you can put the other

00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:05.320
components if you like.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:13.146
Now, take this X to be
the coordinate in space time of

00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:17.204
an object that's moving.
I want to take the derivative

00:55:17.204 --> 00:55:22.059
of that to get myself something
I could call the velocity vector

00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:25.707
in relativity.
But the derivative cannot be

00:55:25.707 --> 00:55:29.792
the time derivative.
You guys have to understand

00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:34.284
that if I take these things--Of
course in space-time,

00:55:34.284 --> 00:55:37.857
the particle is moving.
I can certainly tell you where

00:55:37.857 --> 00:55:40.070
it is at one time and where it
is a little later.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.367
And I can take time derivative.
But the time derivative of a

00:55:43.367 --> 00:55:45.927
vector in fourth dimension is
not a vector,

00:55:45.927 --> 00:55:49.219
because time is like any other
component, you know?

00:55:49.219 --> 00:55:51.929
It's like taking the y
derivative of x. That

00:55:51.929 --> 00:55:54.643
doesn't give you a vector.
You've got to take a derivative

00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:56.785
with respect to somebody that
does not transform,

00:55:56.785 --> 00:55:59.239
that does not change from one
observer to the other.

00:55:59.239 --> 00:56:03.610
So, do you have any idea where
I'm going with this?

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:11.920
Yes?
Student: Space-time.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.460
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.604
Or you can take derivative with
respect to the time as measured

00:56:15.604 --> 00:56:18.090
by the clock which is moving
with the particle.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.460
So, you can take the τ
derivative.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.813
In other words,
let the particle move by some

00:56:22.813 --> 00:56:26.699
amount ΔX,
namely ΔX_0,

00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:29.403
ΔX_1,
ΔX_2,

00:56:29.403 --> 00:56:31.769
etcetera.
That difference will also

00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:34.456
transform like a vector.
We have seen many,

00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:37.407
many times differences as
coordinates and they transform

00:56:37.407 --> 00:56:40.644
like a vector.
Divide it by this guy,

00:56:40.644 --> 00:56:46.349
now, which is the time
according to a clock moving with

00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:49.273
the particle.
Everybody agrees on that,

00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:52.136
because we're not asking how
much time elapsed according to

00:56:52.136 --> 00:56:54.755
you or according to me.
We are going to quarrel about

00:56:54.755 --> 00:56:56.291
that indefinitely.
We are asking,

00:56:56.291 --> 00:56:58.889
how much time passed according
to the particle itself?

00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:01.713
So, no matter who computes the
time, you will get the same

00:57:01.713 --> 00:57:04.239
answer, and that's what you want
to divide it by.

00:57:04.239 --> 00:57:08.952
So, I'm going to form a new
quantity called velocity,

00:57:08.952 --> 00:57:14.390
which is the derivative of this
with respect to τ.

00:57:17.869 --> 00:57:24.527
And I'm going to use the chain
rule and write it as

00:57:24.527 --> 00:57:32.787
dx/dt(dt/dτ).
That becomes then 1/[1

00:57:32.787 --> 00:57:39.597
- (v^(2)/c^(2))]dX
_0/dtdx

00:57:39.597 --> 00:57:48.019
_1/dtdx
_2/dt… So,

00:57:48.019 --> 00:57:50.885
you find the rate of change as
measured by a clock moving with

00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:53.546
the particle.
And that has the virtue that

00:57:53.546 --> 00:57:57.809
what you get out of this process
will also be a four-vector.

00:57:57.809 --> 00:58:00.111
By that I mean,
its four components will

00:58:00.111 --> 00:58:03.476
transform when you go to a
moving frame just like the four

00:58:03.476 --> 00:58:06.482
components of X.
You remember when you took

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.980
x and y and you
rotated the axis,

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.239
x' is x cos τ
plus y sin and so on.

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:14.182
But if you take time
derivatives, you'll find the

00:58:14.182 --> 00:58:15.679
x component of the
velocity,

00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:18.542
in the rotated frame related to
the x and y in the

00:58:18.542 --> 00:58:20.860
old frame by the same cosines
and the same sines,

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.014
because the act of taking
derivatives doesn't change the

00:58:24.014 --> 00:58:28.500
way the object transforms.
So, this is my new four-vector.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.050
In fact, let me put the third
guy too;

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:36.353
dX_3/dt.
So, what I did was I took the

00:58:36.353 --> 00:58:40.274
τ derivative for which
we don't have good intuition and

00:58:40.274 --> 00:58:43.119
ordered in terms of a t
derivative,

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:45.730
for which we have a good
intuition.

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:48.262
Because no matter how much
Einstein tells you about space

00:58:48.262 --> 00:58:50.659
and time, we think of time as
different from space.

00:58:50.659 --> 00:58:52.429
So, we'll think of time in
terms of derivatives.

00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:55.067
But to form a four-dimensional
vector, it's not enough to do

00:58:55.067 --> 00:58:56.619
that.
That's what I'm saying.

00:58:56.619 --> 00:58:59.740
Every term there is divided by
this, because that's the way of

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.911
rewriting d by dτ
as d by dt times

00:59:02.911 --> 00:59:07.168
this factor.
So now, I am ready to define

00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:12.940
what I'm going to call momentum
in relativity.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.309
It's going to be called the
four-momentum.

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:15.980
Everything is the four
something.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.064
The four-vector position,
this is called the

00:59:18.064 --> 00:59:18.840
four-velocity.

00:59:22.909 --> 00:59:24.376
Now, I'm going to define
something called the

00:59:24.376 --> 00:59:24.910
four-momentum.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.741
The four-momentum is going to
be the mass of a particle when

00:59:32.741 --> 00:59:35.660
it's sitting at rest.
Multiply it by this velocity.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.849
So, what is it going to be?
Let me write it out.

00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:46.599
What is
dX_0/dt?

00:59:46.599 --> 00:59:49.170
You guys remember
X_0 = ct.

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:53.224
Sorry?
Student:

00:59:53.224 --> 00:59:55.632
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:59:55.632 --> 00:59:58.623
Shankar: X_0 =
ct and

00:59:58.623 --> 01:00:02.710
dX_0/dt will be
equal to c.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.638
You're right.
If that's what you were saying,

01:00:04.638 --> 01:00:06.199
I agree with you.
Yes.

01:00:06.199 --> 01:00:13.178
So, this is a vector,
m_0c/[1 -

01:00:13.178 --> 01:00:17.517
(v^(2)/c^(2))].
Then the other guy,

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:20.333
other component,
let me write simply as

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:24.260
m_0 times the
familiar velocity times

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.150
[1 -
(v^(2)/c^(2))].

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:30.335
If you wanted to keep the x,
y, and z velocities,

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:33.984
you can keep them as a vector.
Or, if you just wanted to live

01:00:33.984 --> 01:00:36.723
in two dimensions,
one space and one time,

01:00:36.723 --> 01:00:40.465
drop the arrow. So,
we have manufactured now a new

01:00:40.465 --> 01:00:42.710
beast.
It's got four components.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.921
What is it?
I modeled it after the old

01:00:47.921 --> 01:00:49.663
momentum.
I took the mass and I

01:00:49.663 --> 01:00:52.567
multiplied it by what's going to
pass for velocity in my new

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:54.668
world.
And I got this creature with

01:00:54.668 --> 01:00:56.974
four parts.
You've got to understand what

01:00:56.974 --> 01:01:00.002
the four parts mean.
It's got a part that looks like

01:01:00.002 --> 01:01:03.079
an ordinary vector.
And it's got a part,

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:07.431
there's no vectors in it.
Completely an analogy with the

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:11.337
fact that X had a part
that looked like a vector in the

01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:15.115
three spatial components and a
part that in the old days was

01:01:15.115 --> 01:01:17.800
called a scalar,
because it didn't transform.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.991
But of course,
in the new world,

01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:21.505
everything got mixed up.
We got to know who this is and

01:01:21.505 --> 01:01:24.662
we have to know who this is.
So, I want to show you what

01:01:24.662 --> 01:01:25.290
they are.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:37.105
So, here is my new four-vector;
m_0c/[1 -

01:01:37.105 --> 01:01:41.110
(v^(2)/c^(2)).
And m_0v,

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:44.533
let me drop the other
components except this in the

01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:47.909
x direction.
I may not worry about that now.

01:01:47.909 --> 01:01:51.534
I wrote that because I want to
be able to call it a

01:01:51.534 --> 01:01:53.622
four-vector.
It's crazy to call this a

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:55.789
four-vector.
I should call it a two-vector.

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:58.199
You guys have already seen two
vectors.

01:01:58.199 --> 01:02:00.170
Well, you have seen two-vectors
in the x,y plane.

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.710
This is a two-vector in
space-time.

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.420
Or, it's part of this big
four-component object.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.760
It's a four-vector in four
dimensional space-time.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.615
So, we have created something,
and we're trying to understand

01:02:13.615 --> 01:02:16.234
what we have created.
So, let me look at this guy

01:02:16.234 --> 01:02:18.512
first.
This guy looks like

01:02:18.512 --> 01:02:23.070
m_0v divided by
this factor.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:25.883
I don't know what it stands
for, but I say,

01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:29.432
well, relativistic physics
should reduce the Newtonian

01:02:29.432 --> 01:02:33.384
physics when I look at slowly
moving objects because we know

01:02:33.384 --> 01:02:37.068
Newton was perfectly right when
he studied slowly moving

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.776
objects.
If I go to a slowly moving

01:02:39.776 --> 01:02:43.111
object, so v/c becomes
negligible, I drop that,

01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:47.170
and that becomes mv;
I know that's the old momentum.

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:53.048
So, this guy is just the old
momentum properly corrected for

01:02:53.048 --> 01:02:57.690
relativistic theory.
So, this quantity here deserves

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:02.180
to be called momentum p;
you can put an arrow on it,

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.230
if you want,
to keep the p component

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.441
or don't put an arrow so that of
the four vector--the three

01:03:09.441 --> 01:03:13.760
components are just momentum,
but not defined in the old way.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.806
It's not m_0v.
It's m_0

01:03:17.806 --> 01:03:21.407
divided by this.
So, the momentum of a particle

01:03:21.407 --> 01:03:24.530
is very interesting in
relativity, even though nothing

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:27.847
can go faster than light,
that doesn't mean the momentum

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:30.349
has an upper limit at
m_0c,

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:32.929
because the momentum is not
mass times velocity;

01:03:32.929 --> 01:03:35.440
it's mass divided by this crazy
factor.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.374
So, as you approach the speed
of light, as v approaches

01:03:38.374 --> 01:03:40.780
c, the denominator is
very close to zero,

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.070
this number can become as big
as you like.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.550
So, why are people building
bigger and bigger accelerators?

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.858
If you ask them how fast is a
particle moving,

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.731
for everybody in Fermilab,
in Surin it's all close to the

01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:53.805
velocity of light.
It's 99.9999,

01:03:53.805 --> 01:03:56.349
other person has a few more
nines.

01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:58.679
Nothing is impressive when you
look at velocity.

01:03:58.679 --> 01:04:01.067
But when you look at the
momentum, it makes a big

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:03.852
difference how much of the one
you have subtracted on the

01:04:03.852 --> 01:04:05.848
bottom.
If you've only got a difference

01:04:05.848 --> 01:04:08.139
in the 19th decimal place,
well, you've got a huge

01:04:08.139 --> 01:04:10.252
momentum.
So, particles have limited

01:04:10.252 --> 01:04:13.119
velocity in relativity,
but unlimited momentum.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:16.480
It also means,
to speed up this particle is

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.039
going to take more and more
force as it picks up speed.

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:24.114
In other words,
you'll be pushing it like

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:25.749
crazy.
It won't pick up speed,

01:04:25.749 --> 01:04:27.300
but its momentum will be going
up.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.033
It'll pick up speed,
but this pickup in speed will

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.933
be imperceptible because in the
19th decimal place of

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:35.639
v/c,
it'll go from 99999 to

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:39.400
something near the end.
The last digit will change.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.300
But the momentum will change a
lot.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.320
But I don't want to stop before
looking at this guy.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.700
So, we don't know who this is.
So, we take this thing,

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.940
this is a zero component of
p.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.663
Just like I called it
X_0 in the old

01:04:52.663 --> 01:04:54.320
days, I'm going to call it
P_0.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.355
P_0 was
m_0c/[1 -

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:02.965
(v^(2)/c^(2))].
So, I don't know what to make

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:06.827
of this guy either.
If I put v = 0,

01:05:06.827 --> 01:05:12.170
I get m_0c.
That looks like the mass of a

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:15.285
particle, but I have no idea.
Okay, so it's the mass of a

01:05:15.285 --> 01:05:17.636
particle.
See here, when I put v =

01:05:17.636 --> 01:05:20.570
0 on the bottom,
because the top had a v,

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.686
not v/c,
something was left over that

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:25.860
looked like something familiar,
namely momentum.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:29.418
Here, if I take v = 0
too quickly, what's left over is

01:05:29.418 --> 01:05:32.800
nothing reminiscent of anything
in Newtonian mechanics.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.208
So, you want to go in what's
called the next order in

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.997
v/c.
You don't want to totally

01:05:37.997 --> 01:05:40.736
ignore it.
You want to keep the first

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:43.509
non-zero term,
so we write it as

01:05:43.509 --> 01:05:48.788
m_0c[1 -
(v^(2)/c^(2))]^(-1/2). I've

01:05:48.788 --> 01:05:53.798
just written it with a thing
upstairs for the - ½ as the

01:05:53.798 --> 01:05:57.663
exponent.
Then, I remind you of the good

01:05:57.663 --> 01:06:02.530
old formula: 1 + x^(n) =
1 + nx plus--if

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:07.966
x is very small.
So, if you use that,

01:06:07.966 --> 01:06:17.778
you get m_0c[1
+ (v^(2)/2c^(2)) plus

01:06:17.778 --> 01:06:24.930
higher powers of
v^(2)/c^(2). So,

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:27.801
what are these terms coming out?
Well, there's the first term,

01:06:27.801 --> 01:06:30.019
for which I have absolutely no
intuition.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:35.360
The second term looks like ½
(mv)^(2)/c.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.690
So, for the first time,
I see something familiar.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:45.939
I see the good old kinetic
energy, but not quite,

01:06:45.939 --> 01:06:48.849
because I have this number
c here.

01:06:48.849 --> 01:06:52.272
So, I decided maybe I shouldn't
look at P_0,

01:06:52.272 --> 01:06:54.840
but I should look at
cP_0.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.449
Maybe that looks something more
familiar.

01:06:56.449 --> 01:06:59.268
That looks like
m_0c^(2) + ½

01:06:59.268 --> 01:07:02.964
(mv)^(2) plus more and
more terms depending on higher

01:07:02.964 --> 01:07:05.720
and higher powers of
v^(2)/c^(2).

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.513
But now we know who this guy is.
This is what we used to call

01:07:10.513 --> 01:07:14.869
the kinetic energy of a particle
by virtue of its motion.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:17.733
As the particle picks up speed,
the kinetic energy itself

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:20.444
receives more connections
because the other terms with

01:07:20.444 --> 01:07:23.410
more and more powers of
v/c are not negligible.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.195
You've got to put them back in.
Basically, you have to compute

01:07:26.195 --> 01:07:28.304
this object exactly.
But at low velocities,

01:07:28.304 --> 01:07:32.342
this is the main term.
So, this is what led Einstein

01:07:32.342 --> 01:07:38.264
and mainly him to realize that
this quantity is talking about

01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:42.976
the energy of an object.
This is certainly energy

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.039
recognized.
I can put it to good use, right?

01:07:46.039 --> 01:07:48.863
You run windmills and so on
with kinetic energy,

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:52.348
or hydroelectric power is from
channeling kinetic energy of

01:07:52.348 --> 01:07:55.037
water into work.
So, you figure this is also

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:57.409
part of the energy.
So, the first conclusion of

01:07:57.409 --> 01:07:59.056
Einstein was,
even a particle that's

01:07:59.056 --> 01:08:01.690
non-moving seems to have an
energy, and that's called the

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.857
rest energy.
If the particle is moving,

01:08:04.857 --> 01:08:09.045
then go back to the derivation
and you can find

01:08:09.045 --> 01:08:13.688
cP_0 =
m_0c^(2) over this

01:08:13.688 --> 01:08:16.356
thing.
This is the full expression for

01:08:16.356 --> 01:08:19.840
the energy of a moving particle.
Not the approximate one,

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.760
but if you keep the whole
thing, this is what you get.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.331
So, this says when a particle
moves, it's got an energy that

01:08:27.331 --> 01:08:30.600
looks like some velocity
depending on mc^(2).

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.932
And when the particle is at
rest, it has got that energy,

01:08:33.932 --> 01:08:37.444
and that's the origin of the
big formula relating energy and

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:39.300
mass.
So, it leaves open the

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.819
possibility that even a particle
at rest;

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:44.153
you think when a particle is at
rest, you have squeezed

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.967
everything you can get out of
the particle,

01:08:45.967 --> 01:08:48.050
right?
What more can it do for you?

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.069
It gave it all it's got and
it's stopped.

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:52.529
But according to Einstein,
there is a lot of fun left.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:55.380
We can do something more if
there's a way to destroy this.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.747
So, in his theory,
it doesn't tell you how you

01:08:58.747 --> 01:09:01.787
should do that.
But it did point out that if

01:09:01.787 --> 01:09:05.069
you can get rid of the mass,
because it was energy,

01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:08.102
some other form of energy must
take its place by the law of

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:11.164
conservation of energy.
So, that's how all the nuclear

01:09:11.164 --> 01:09:13.401
reactions work.
In nuclear reactions,

01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:16.312
you can take two parts,
like two hydrogen atoms,

01:09:16.312 --> 01:09:19.111
hydrogen nuclei.
You can fuse them into helium

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:22.409
and you will find the helium's
mass is less than the mass of

01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:25.236
the two parts.
So, there is some energy

01:09:25.236 --> 01:09:26.850
missing.
Some mass missing;

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.510
that means there's some energy
is missing.

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:30.189
That's the energy released in
fusion.

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:34.454
Or you can take uranium nucleus
and give it a tap and break it

01:09:34.454 --> 01:09:37.739
up into barium and krypton and
some neutrons.

01:09:37.739 --> 01:09:40.270
And you will find the fragments
together have a mass less than

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.331
the paired.
And the missing mass times

01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:45.784
c^(2) is the energy of
the reaction that comes out in

01:09:45.784 --> 01:09:48.770
the kinetic energy of the fast
moving particles.

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:51.467
So, Einstein is wrongly called
the father of the bomb,

01:09:51.467 --> 01:09:53.300
because this is as far as he
went.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.071
Didn't specify how to extract
energy from mass,

01:09:56.071 --> 01:09:59.627
but showed very clearly that
rest energy--that a particle at

01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:03.302
rest seems to have a term that
should be called energy because

01:10:03.302 --> 01:10:05.789
this guy certainly is.
Yes?

01:10:05.789 --> 01:10:07.448
Student:
[inaudible]

01:10:07.448 --> 01:10:10.382
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Will be 3/8

01:10:10.382 --> 01:10:12.869
m_0
(v^(4)/c^(4)).

01:10:12.869 --> 01:10:17.077
I don't carry more terms in my
head, but frankly,

01:10:17.077 --> 01:10:19.209
you won't need it.
Student:

01:10:19.209 --> 01:10:20.045
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:21.590
Shankar: There are more
corrections to kinetic energy.

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:24.200
In other words,
why is this an important

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.352
concept?
If two particles collide,

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:29.823
we believe energy is conserved.
So, you want to add the energy

01:10:29.823 --> 01:10:31.869
before and compare it to energy
after.

01:10:31.869 --> 01:10:35.074
If you want them to perfectly
match, if you stop here,

01:10:35.074 --> 01:10:37.130
your book keeping will not
work.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:40.466
Before will not equal after.
You've got to keep all this

01:10:40.466 --> 01:10:43.090
infinite number of terms to get
it exactly right.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:46.010
But if you're satisfied to one
part in a million or something,

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:48.069
maybe that's as many terms as
are needed.

01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:50.784
And at very low velocities,
you don't even need that

01:10:50.784 --> 01:10:53.340
because this is never changing
in a collision.

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.341
Every particle has a rest mass.
This is what we balanced when

01:10:56.341 --> 01:10:58.734
we collided.
Remember, we collided blocks

01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:00.899
and we balanced the kinetic
energy?

01:11:00.899 --> 01:11:03.220
Actually, that energy is there
in every block,

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.922
but it is not changing.
It is canceling out in the

01:11:05.922 --> 01:11:08.077
before and after.
So, unless the two blocks

01:11:08.077 --> 01:11:10.622
annihilated and disappeared,
then you would really have

01:11:10.622 --> 01:11:14.261
something interesting.
But you don't have that in the

01:11:14.261 --> 01:11:16.569
Newtonian physics.
Okay.

01:11:16.569 --> 01:11:19.768
So, I should tell you that I've
given you guys two more

01:11:19.768 --> 01:11:21.960
problems, one of which is
optional.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.055
You don't have to do that,
but it's a very interesting

01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:27.257
problem.
And I want you to think about

01:11:27.257 --> 01:11:30.158
it because it's a problem
whether there's two rockets

01:11:30.158 --> 01:11:33.170
headed towards each other,
both of the same length;

01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:35.915
say one meter.
And this guy thinks he is at

01:11:35.915 --> 01:11:39.739
rest, and the second rocket is
zooming past him like this.

01:11:39.739 --> 01:11:42.850
When the tail of this rocket
passes the tip of this,

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.900
he sends out a little torpedo
aimed at this one.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.277
Clearly, it doesn't do any harm.
But look at it from the point

01:11:49.277 --> 01:11:51.642
of view of this person.
This person says,

01:11:51.642 --> 01:11:55.239
"Well, I'm a big rocket.
I'm moving like this,

01:11:55.239 --> 01:12:00.733
and when my tail met the tip of
this rocket, he sent out an

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:05.279
explosive, which certainly hit
me down here."

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.558
So, the question is,
"Does this upper rocket get

01:12:07.558 --> 01:12:09.637
attacked?"
Does it get hit by the lower

01:12:09.637 --> 01:12:11.255
one or not?
From one point of view,

01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:13.086
you miss.
The other point of view,

01:12:13.086 --> 01:12:15.665
when you expand this one and
shrink this one,

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.153
you definitely got hit.
So, you've got to ask,

01:12:18.153 --> 01:12:19.949
I mean, do you get hit or don't
get hit?

01:12:19.949 --> 01:12:22.270
You cannot have two answers to
one question.

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:25.332
So, I've given the problem.
I've given you a lot of terms,

01:12:25.332 --> 01:12:27.988
and I think even though it's
optional, if you do that

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.220
how to think clearly about any

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.000

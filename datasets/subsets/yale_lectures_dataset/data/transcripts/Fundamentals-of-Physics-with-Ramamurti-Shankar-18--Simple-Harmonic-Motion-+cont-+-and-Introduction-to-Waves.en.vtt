00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:11.390
Okay, so what problem were we
trying to solve?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.977
We were trying to solve the
problem of masses,

00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:16.507
coupled to springs,
and acted upon by various

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:19.285
forces.
And the equation that we need

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.910
is the following [writes
equation on the board].

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.420
So, this is the most general
problem we looked at.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110
This is F_0.
I might have just called it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.190
F last time.
It doesn't matter;

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.300
it's a matter of this symbols,
okay?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.125
Alright.
Let us first divide everything

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:56.245
by m.
Divide everything by m,

00:00:56.245 --> 00:01:01.340
then it becomes x double
dot, plus γx dot,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.642
plus
ω_0^(2)x,

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:06.910
equals F_0
over m,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.972
cos ωt.
I'm using the fact that

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:16.995
ω_0 was
defined as the root of k

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:19.958
over n.
We used to call it ω,

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.139
but now I'm calling it
ω_0,

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.519
and you should understand why
I'm doing that,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:27.220
because there are now two
ωs in the problem.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.754
There is, the ω of the
driving force,

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:32.921
so you should imagine an
oscillatory force grabbing this

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:35.110
mass and moving it back and
forth.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.470
ω_0 is the
natural frequency of the mass.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.407
If you pull the spring and let
it go, that's the frequency that

00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:43.776
it will vibrate.
There are really the natural

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.538
frequency that is fixed by
k and m and

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:50.185
ω is for you to decide.
You can decide to apply to it

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.489
any force you like of any
frequency.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.543
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So first,

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:57.110
take the easy case in which the
right-hand side is 0.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.986
No driving force.
So, I'm saying let's consider a

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:06.218
simple case,
F_0,

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:10.430
or F,
the applied force vanishes.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.407
That's the problem I spent a
considerable amount of time on

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:15.882
yesterday.
You can say,

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:19.200
"Well, if there's no driving
force, why does anything move?"

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.460
That's actually correct.
If you took a mass in a spring

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.135
and didn't do anything to it,
the solution of this equation

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.479
is x = 0,
and that is fine.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.807
But it also has interesting
non-trivial solutions because

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:36.129
you can pull the mass and then
let it go.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.836
After you let it go,
there are no forces on the

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:42.072
system except the force of
friction and the force of the

00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:44.250
spring, and that is this
problem.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.470
Now, how do you solve this
problem?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.200
I told you the way you solve
this problem is you make a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.138
guess: x of t is
some number, A times

00:02:54.138 --> 00:02:58.259
e to the αt.
See if it'll work.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.610
And you find it will work and
you can do this in your head.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.379
I certainly don't want to
repeat all of that.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.779
The reason it's going to work
is that every time you take

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.411
derivative of x,
you bring down an α,

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:09.810
and still keep e to the
αt.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.207
So, when you put that guess
into this equation,

00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:14.969
you're going to get
α^(2) plus γα,

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.242
plus ω_0
square times A,

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:20.970
e to the αt
equal to 0.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.193
And if this is going to vanish,
it's not because of A

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:28.689
and it's not because of the
αt,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.580
it's because this guy in
brackets is going to vanish.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.933
So, when that's 0,
you all recognize this to be a

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:39.793
quadratic equation.
You go back to your days in the

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:41.771
sand box [earlier in the course
or your life]

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.930
when you all knew what the
answer to this is;

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.069
the answer to this is minus
γ over two,

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.120
plus or minus γ over
two square, minus

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.080
ω_0 square.
These are the roots.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.680
Now here, you have to look
at--So anyway,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.340
what does this mean?
This means that yes,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.724
you can find a solution to this
equation that looks like

00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:11.120
A to the αt;
A can be any number you

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.118
like.
No restriction is placed on

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:16.113
A.
But α cannot be any

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.976
number you like.
α has to be the

00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:20.659
solution to this quadratic
equation and there are two

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.102
solutions.
So, you can call them α

00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:26.992
plus and α minus.
That's when I branched off into

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:30.446
two different cases.
Case one, you can see look,

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:34.031
many of the quadratic
equations, you know the way it's

00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.157
going to fall out is depending
on whether the stuff inside the

00:04:38.157 --> 00:04:42.633
bracket is positive or negative.
So, let's take the easier case

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:45.792
when it's positive,
that means γ over two

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:48.490
is bigger than
ω_0n.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.030
γ, you remember,
is the force of friction so we

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.951
want it to be not only non-zero,
but bigger than this amount

00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:58.269
controlled by the natural
frequency.

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.493
In that case,
let's not go into details,

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:03.571
but you can all see you put
whatever value you have for

00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.649
γ, the square root of
this is some number.

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.689
The whole thing is going to be
two real choices you get.

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.887
One will be minus γ
over 2, plus whatever is inside

00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:17.450
the square root.
The other will be minus

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.807
γ over 2,
minus what you have in the

00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:22.730
square root.
The only thing I want you to

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.180
notice is that both these roots
are negative.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.851
This guy's obviously negative
because it's a minus γ

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.459
over 2 minus something else,
that's definitely negative.

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.030
You have a little [inaudible]
worried [inaudible]

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.798
here, that this is minus
γ over two and this is

00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:39.447
plus something.
But the plus something is

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:43.828
smaller than the minus
something, because what's inside

00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:47.560
the square root is γ
over 2 square.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.878
If you took the square root of
that you'll get exactly

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:52.224
γ over 2.
But you're taking away from it,

00:05:52.224 --> 00:05:54.665
this number;
therefore, this square root is

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:58.036
smaller than this number,
so the overall thing will still

00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:01.772
come out negative.
So, why am I so eager that it

00:06:01.772 --> 00:06:05.955
should come out negative?
Why am I eager that the root

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:08.949
should be negative?
Yes?

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.161
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:14.718
Shankar: No,
even if I had positive,

00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:17.930
if I took two derivatives,
it would work out.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.536
Yes?
Student: Because if

00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:23.470
alpha is greater than one,
then the e won't

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.345
converge to cosine.
Professor Ramamurti

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.800
Shankar: Won't converge to
what?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.300
Student: The cosine
function?

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.521
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This is not a

00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:33.540
cosine function.
This is never going to be.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.494
A cosine function is related to
e to the iωt or

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:40.018
e to ix.
These are all real

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:41.040
exponentials,
yes?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.320
Student: If alpha is
positive t goes up

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.768
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:46.829
Shankar: Yeah,
that's our main problem.

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.258
When you write exponential
function--;Usually,

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:52.550
people write exponentials like
this, for population growth.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.359
Everyone says our problems are
increasing exponentially,

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:57.709
they always think of
exponentials as rising.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.758
Of course, it's also possible
that if α were a

00:07:00.758 --> 00:07:03.403
negative number,
you could write it as A

00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:06.739
times the absolute value of
α just to show you it's

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:09.936
a falling exponential.
And we have a stomach only for

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:12.743
falling exponentials.
You've got to think if I pull

00:07:12.743 --> 00:07:15.803
this mass and I let it go,
I expect x to go down

00:07:15.803 --> 00:07:18.410
from whatever value I have,
not to keep growing

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.857
indefinitely.
That doesn't make any physical

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.641
sense.
And one of the great things

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.704
about the union of mathematics
and physics is the equation

00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:27.639
automatically works out that
way.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.839
It gives you an answer that
makes sense.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:36.199
Okay, so what you get then is a
solution that looks like this.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.756
One number A times
e to one of the roots

00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:45.140
plus another number,
B, times e to the

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.813
other root.
I wrote them--they're both

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:50.687
e to the αt,
but I write it as minus the

00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:53.242
absolute value so you can all
see they're falling

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:56.043
exponentials.
You understand if a number is

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:59.666
negative, like negative five,
that can be written as minus

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.589
one times the absolute value of
the number.

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:05.678
So, it is e to the the
αt, but I want to write

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:07.480
it in this form,
so it's falling.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.963
So, this is a case where if you
pull the mass and you let it go,

00:08:12.963 --> 00:08:17.750
it will just relax eventually
coming to x = 0,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.069
which is its normal equilibrium
location.

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:23.730
Now, how about the numbers
A and B?

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.550
Right now, they're completely
arbitrary.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.588
And another thing you guys
should know by now is how we

00:08:28.588 --> 00:08:31.885
find A and B.
In order to find A and

00:08:31.885 --> 00:08:35.100
B, we need to be given
more information other than

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.570
simply the mass and the spring
constant.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.288
They're all sitting here,
and the friction coefficient,

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:43.509
but that's not enough to tell
you what it does on a given day.

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:45.550
It wants to know,
well, yes, it's the mass,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.174
there's that the spring,
but did you pull it or did you

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:50.070
release it in this way or that
way?

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.262
That's what controls the answer.
They're called initial

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:55.892
conditions.
One initial condition is what

00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:58.990
was the value of x at
time, t = 0?

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.049
That's asking you how much you
pulled it when you let it go.

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:05.899
The other initial condition is,
what is the velocity?

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.879
Namely, the derivative of
x at time 0.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:11.549
Most of the time,
what you will find as you pull

00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:14.617
the mass and release it,
then it's got a non-0 x

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:17.407
and a 0 velocity.
But it doesn't have to be that

00:09:17.407 --> 00:09:20.763
way because I could have pulled
it and released it at t =

00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:22.490
0,
starting to move inwards,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.879
and that's when you jump in and
you set your clocks to 0.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:28.518
Well at that instant,
x has a value and the

00:09:28.518 --> 00:09:31.875
velocity also has a non-0 value.
They don't all have to be 0,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.980
but they are some two numbers
that you can pick at will.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.577
You can see that if I put
t = 0,

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.927
I'm going to get A times
e to the 0,

00:09:40.927 --> 00:09:43.346
which is one.
I'm going to get A +

00:09:43.346 --> 00:09:45.914
B is x(0).
That's one condition on

00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:48.750
A and B.
I will take a derivative,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.498
namely, find the velocity,
then put T = 0,

00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:54.360
and set that equal to some
pre-assigned number,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.816
you'll get a second equation
for A and B,

00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:59.317
and we all know we can solve
those two equations to find

00:09:59.317 --> 00:10:02.413
A and B.
That's how you fit these three

00:10:02.413 --> 00:10:06.050
parameters to the solution
tailor-made for that particular

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.521
situation.
You should also ask another

00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:12.284
question.
Why is it that I can pick these

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:15.393
numbers, x_0
and v_0,

00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:18.953
but why not keep going?
Maybe they're the acceleration

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:22.021
of times 0 is some number.
Why is that not up to me to

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:22.380
decide?

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.810
Can anyone tell me why that's
not negotiable?

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.098
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:36.700
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Depends upon what?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.450
Can I pick the acceleration of
a body at will?

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.588
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:47.875
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:52.476
I'm not sure I heard the exact
answer but it sounds close

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:57.154
enough to what I had in mind,
which is Newton will tell you

00:10:57.154 --> 00:11:00.534
what the acceleration of a body
is, namely mass times

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:03.302
acceleration is the force,
and the force,

00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:07.084
once it's given in any given
problem, which is given by where

00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.719
the body is,
and what the velocity is in

00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:12.410
this example,
you have no choice on what the

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.961
acceleration is.
But initial position and

00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.230
velocity are not given by
Newton's law.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.482
Newton's law says,
if the force is so and so,

00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:22.205
the acceleration is so and so,
but he doesn't tell you what

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:24.414
should be the velocity at a
given time, what should be the

00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:27.339
position at a given time.
That's why they are two free

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:31.214
numbers, that's why you have an
answer with two free numbers

00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:35.549
that you can pick to bring it in
accord with these two numbers.

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:40.378
Okay, this solution to the
equation with F = 0 from

00:11:40.378 --> 00:11:44.529
now on, I'm going to call
x_c,

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:46.930
where c stands for the
complimentary function.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.342
Now, there's another thing that
could have happened here,

00:11:55.342 --> 00:11:58.039
which is in fact another
alternative.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:00.250
You can think about what I'm
saying.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.409
The other alternative is when
this γ over 2 is smaller

00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:05.954
than this ω_0.
Then, of course,

00:12:05.954 --> 00:12:08.259
you have the square root of a
negative number.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:11.603
So, then you go back to the
stage where you're finding the

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:15.240
root, and you say α
equals minus γ over two,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.424
plus or minus the square root
of γ over two^(2) minus

00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:21.470
ω_0^(2),
but that number is negative.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.913
So, that can be returned as a
negative sign,

00:12:23.913 --> 00:12:26.129
times the square root of this
number,

00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:31.671
and the square root of minus
one will come out as an i

00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:34.520
out front.
So, either you will get two

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.164
real roots, this is a
mathematical result,

00:12:37.164 --> 00:12:39.549
it has nothing to do with
physics,

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:42.391
a quadratic equation with real
coefficients either will have

00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:45.312
two real roots,
or it will have two roots which

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:47.889
are complex conjugates of each
other.

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:50.007
You learned the notion of
complex conjugation,

00:12:50.007 --> 00:12:52.360
which is to exchange i
to minus i,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.136
you can see the α plus
and α minus have the

00:12:55.136 --> 00:12:57.203
same real part,
minus γ over 2,

00:12:57.203 --> 00:12:59.110
and have opposite imaginary
parts.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.822
So, in this example,
α plus is the complex

00:13:02.822 --> 00:13:07.594
conjugate of α minus and
I've told you this relationship

00:13:07.594 --> 00:13:10.646
works both ways;
therefore, α minus is a

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:12.480
complex conjugate of α
plus.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.440
So, what's the solution going
to look like?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.968
It's going to look like
Ae to the minus

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:25.597
γt over two,
e to the iω

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:29.018
prime t,
but I'm going to call this

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.279
fellow in brackets as ω
prime.

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.889
Then, there's the second
solution.

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:38.951
The real part is exactly the
same, the imaginary part is

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.400
opposite, minus iω prime
t.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.132
ω prime is a new
frequency connected to the

00:13:50.132 --> 00:13:53.409
natural frequency and the
frictional force.

00:13:53.409 --> 00:13:54.960
That's why, we've got three
ωs.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.568
We've got to keep that in mind.
ω_0 is a

00:13:57.568 --> 00:14:00.475
natural frequency of vibration.
If I have a driving force,

00:14:00.475 --> 00:14:03.684
I reserve the symbol ω
for the frequency of the driving

00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:05.772
force.
Here is yet another quantity

00:14:05.772 --> 00:14:09.190
with units of frequency which
I'm calling ω prime.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.629
So, what does this guy look
like?

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:13.509
But first of all,
it's full of complex numbers

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:15.868
and we don't like it.
We know the oscillator should

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:18.281
have a real coordinate,
so you ask, I've not picked

00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.241
A and B yet,
how shall I pick them so that

00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:24.169
x is real?
Well, forget A and B for

00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:27.330
a minute and look at this number
and this number.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.030
Do you guys realize that
they're complex conjugates of

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.080
each other, because i has
gone to minus i.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.108
So for example,
if A and B were

00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:38.998
equal numbers,
this would be a real number

00:14:38.998 --> 00:14:40.750
because number plus its
conjugate,

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.536
you killed imaginary part
because they have opposite

00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:45.528
imaginary parts.
So, A and B real

00:14:45.528 --> 00:14:47.008
[and equal as stated above]
is a good answer,

00:14:47.008 --> 00:14:49.700
but it's too restrictive.
All we will demand is that if

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.322
A looks like absolute
value of A times e

00:14:53.322 --> 00:14:56.143
to the iφ,
B should look like the absolute

00:14:56.143 --> 00:14:58.700
value of A times e to the
minus iφ.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.428
In other words,
B should be the complex

00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:03.401
conjugate of A.
That means the same absolute

00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:06.140
value, but opposite phase.
I remind you,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.182
in the complex plane,
if a number z is sitting

00:15:09.182 --> 00:15:11.990
there, the complex conjugate is
sitting here,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.789
they have opposite angles,
φ.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.754
So, if you do that,
then you get A absolute

00:15:18.754 --> 00:15:22.799
value, e to the minus
γ over two,

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:27.080
times e to the
iω prime t plus

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.285
φ, plus e to the
minus iω prime t

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:38.080
plus φ.
Now we have made it real.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.883
A and B,
both being fully real means

00:15:40.883 --> 00:15:43.686
this φ is 0,
but you see φ doesn't

00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:46.122
really have to be 0.
That is too much of a

00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:47.962
restriction.
φ can be whatever you

00:15:47.962 --> 00:15:49.879
like provided the φ that
A has,

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:51.420
the phase that A has,
is the same [correction:

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.080
should have said "minus"]
the phase that B has.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.398
That means the angle in the
complex plane of the number

00:15:55.398 --> 00:15:57.930
A and the number B
have to be opposite of each

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.748
other.
This, you guys should know what

00:16:02.748 --> 00:16:04.700
it is.
I've told you many times.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.379
This is unforgivable if you
don't know what this is.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:10.116
e to iθ,
plus e to the minus

00:16:10.116 --> 00:16:12.350
iθ over two,
is cos θ.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.629
Since you don't have the over
two, you can write it as

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:18.970
2A, e to the minus
γ over two,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:25.617
cosine of whatever is in here,
ω prime t plus

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.733
φ.
At this point,

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:31.060
I'm going to change my notation
a little bit in view of what's

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.588
to come.
Instead of calling this

00:16:32.588 --> 00:16:34.809
φ, I'm going to call it
φ_0.

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:38.411
Alright, because another
φ is going to come in

00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:40.789
and I want to separate those
two.

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:44.003
So, two times A is a new
number, I'm going to call that

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.110
C, and this is the bottom
line.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.800
The answer looks like e
to the minus γt over

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.155
two, cos ω prime
t plus

00:16:52.155 --> 00:16:53.810
φ_0.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.779
So, we had done all this
yesterday.

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:05.436
I've given you the notes,
but I want you to understand

00:17:05.436 --> 00:17:07.990
where we're going with all of
this.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.508
If you pull a mass and let it
go, it turns out there are two

00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:14.120
things that can happen.
I really wish I had time to

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.069
bring you these different masses
and show you.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.207
If you have no friction,
everyone knows what's going to

00:17:19.207 --> 00:17:21.190
happen.
You pull the mass and let it go;

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.046
it oscillates forever.
In real life,

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:25.896
there's always some friction,
so let's turn on a little

00:17:25.896 --> 00:17:28.108
friction.
What'll happen is what's very

00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:30.958
familiar and expected.
We start with an amplitude of

00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.557
five, go to four,
go to three,

00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:35.920
go to two, rock back and forth
and slowly it may wiggle around

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.185
but you won't be able to see it.
That's called a damped

00:17:39.185 --> 00:17:41.816
oscillation.
That's really what's described

00:17:41.816 --> 00:17:45.062
by this solution.
Here, it looks like a cosine of

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:48.928
something, but the number in
front of it itself is falling

00:17:48.928 --> 00:17:51.456
with time.
And the picture for that will

00:17:51.456 --> 00:17:53.897
look like the following:
if you just draw an

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:56.849
exponentially falling function
as your amplitude,

00:17:56.849 --> 00:18:00.432
and you multiply that by an
oscillating cosine it will do

00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:03.730
this.
This is a damped oscillation.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.984
But another extreme case which
you may not think about is,

00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:09.039
if you crank up the friction
more,

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.997
‘till γ over two is
bigger than

00:18:10.997 --> 00:18:13.394
ω_0,
then what happens is if you

00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:16.509
pull the mass and let it go,
it doesn't even go to the other

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:19.276
side of x = 0.
It just slowly gets to 0,

00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:22.410
in an infinite amount of time,
you understand?

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.180
If you pull it from here,
you let it go.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.909
No friction is this [moving
hand back and forth]

00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:30.276
for eternity.
Small amount of friction has

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:34.825
slowly damped the oscillation.
Too much of friction,

00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:38.480
you come back slowly and you
come to rest.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.498
These are different cases and
the mathematics tells you the

00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:44.412
different cases so that's what
we like about the union of

00:18:44.412 --> 00:18:47.407
mathematics and physics.
Once you wrote down the basic

00:18:47.407 --> 00:18:49.741
law of Newton,
you have no choice as to where

00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:51.542
it takes you.
You go where it takes,

00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:53.230
and these are the different
solutions.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.180
Okay, so this is what I did
earlier on in the day.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.573
But now, let's go back to the
more general problem I had,

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:03.299
which is a right-hand side
which, is not 0.

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:06.021
So, let's write the right-hand
side which is not zero as

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:08.532
x double dot,
plus γx dot,

00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:10.738
plus
ω_0^(2)x,

00:19:10.738 --> 00:19:13.940
equals F_0
over m,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.042
cos ωt.
This is called a driven

00:19:18.042 --> 00:19:20.486
oscillator.
Driven oscillators are present

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:21.884
all the time.
For example,

00:19:21.884 --> 00:19:25.240
if you have a swing,
the swing goes back and forth.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.009
You may choose to push the
swing back and forth.

00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:31.091
If you've got a kid in a park,
you're applying a force which

00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:34.376
is an oscillating force.
Whereas in the absence of

00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:37.227
external forces,
all oscillations will

00:19:37.227 --> 00:19:40.380
eventually die down.
Do you guys understand that?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.512
Why?
Why do all oscillations die

00:19:43.512 --> 00:19:45.590
down in the absence of external
forces?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:52.302
Student: Friction?
Professor Ramamurti

00:19:52.302 --> 00:19:53.790
Shankar: Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.362
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.012
well in this case,
it's not air resistance,

00:19:57.012 --> 00:19:58.963
but friction.
But what friction does is that

00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:01.242
in the presence of friction,
you cannot prove the Law of

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.410
Conservation of Energy.
We saw that.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.062
Whenever friction acts,
the energy total mechanical

00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:08.661
energy goes down.
So, kinetic plus potential will

00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:11.279
decrease with time so the
oscillations get damped.

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:14.268
But if you are pushing it from
outside, you can provide a

00:20:14.268 --> 00:20:17.096
constant source of energy so you
can maintain a steady

00:20:17.096 --> 00:20:19.384
oscillation,
and that's the problem we're

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:22.480
looking at.
That is this problem.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.369
So, how did we solve this
problem?

00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:28.440
Well, I said I don't want to
solve this equation.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.460
I'm going to manufacture
another problem.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.607
z double dot,
plus γ times z

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:36.819
dot, plus ω_0
square z,

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:40.158
is F_0 over
m, e to the

00:20:40.158 --> 00:20:41.040
iωt.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.255
So, let's be very clear.
This is a real physics problem

00:20:48.255 --> 00:20:51.046
that occurs all the time.
This [pointing to other

00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.907
equation]
is clearly not of our world,

00:20:52.907 --> 00:20:55.070
because in our world you don't
have a force,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.247
e to the iωt.
All forces in the real world

00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:01.079
are real.
So, this is a complex force.

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:03.599
If you break down the e
to the iωt,

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:06.324
you all know it's cos
ωt, which I like,

00:21:06.324 --> 00:21:08.690
plus i sin ωt,
which I don't like.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:13.919
I'm solving a problem in which
on top of the force I'm really

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:18.800
applying, there's an imaginary
force put on top of it.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.951
So, what is the strategy?
Why have we taken the problem

00:21:21.951 --> 00:21:24.670
and making it worse than it is?
Because we have a strategy and

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.713
the strategy is the following.
If you have right-hand side

00:21:27.713 --> 00:21:30.855
cos ωt,
ask yourself what you're trying

00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:32.889
to do.
You're looking for some

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:36.160
function x(t),
which will obey this equation.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.888
You can try various functions,
maybe x is a cosine of

00:21:40.888 --> 00:21:42.831
time.
If it's a cosine of time,

00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:44.710
two derivatives will be a
cosine.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.631
No derivative will be a sine.
One derivative will--I'm sorry,

00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:52.039
no derivative will be cosine,
one derivative will be a sine.

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:53.509
So, you cannot make it into a
cosine.

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:57.120
If you took a sine,
the middle guy will look like a

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.869
cosine.
You can try to balance that

00:21:58.869 --> 00:22:00.955
against this;
the end two terms look like

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:03.369
cosine, so neither sin nor a
cosine works.

00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:05.650
It turns out something in
between will work.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.609
But something that always works
is the following.

00:22:08.609 --> 00:22:10.931
If the right-hand side,
instead of being cos

00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.859
ωt, was e to the
iωt, you can guess the

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:16.400
answer immediately.
Namely z itself will

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.313
behave like e to the
iωt, because then if I

00:22:19.313 --> 00:22:21.671
take two derivatives,
that's going to look like

00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:23.799
e to the iωt,
times some numbers,

00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:26.380
that's going to look like
e to the iωt,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.380
that's going to look like
e to the iωt.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.161
So, the beauty of the
exponential is when you take

00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:31.870
derivatives you keep getting the
exponential.

00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:39.596
Okay, but now,
the problem is this is not the

00:22:39.596 --> 00:22:42.315
problem.
No one told you to solve this

00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:45.069
problem, but our strategy is the
following.

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:48.450
The right-hand side has got a
real force and imaginary force.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.390
The real force will produce the
x that I want.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.179
The imaginary force,
purely imaginary,

00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:54.645
i times sin
ωt, will produce a

00:22:54.645 --> 00:22:57.660
purely imaginary answer.
So, at the end of the day,

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.980
I will find the answer and keep
only the real part.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.923
That's the plan.
That's going to be the

00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:07.860
strategy, so that this z,
this z is going to be

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.155
the x that I want and,
will have a part hanging

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:12.900
around, y,
that I don't want,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.940
but y is being driven by
the sin ωt.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.289
And x is being driven by
the cos ωt.

00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:21.480
But now, let's solve it by
inspection.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.125
So, let's make a guess that
z looks like some number

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:30.289
z_0,
e to the iωt.

00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:32.690
Now, it's very easy to take
derivatives of exponential.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.910
Just pull down iω every
time you see a derivative.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.114
So, z double dot will
become iω square,

00:23:39.114 --> 00:23:41.170
which is minus ω
square.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.609
z dot will become
iω, there's a γ

00:23:44.609 --> 00:23:46.986
there, and
ω_0^(2) is

00:23:46.986 --> 00:23:50.972
just multiplying by a number.
So, this is what I get on the

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:53.955
left-hand side,
and I want it to equal this on

00:23:53.955 --> 00:23:58.251
the right-hand side.
And you're almost there because

00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:02.900
the time dependence of the two
sides are identical,

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.464
so you can cancel it and what
you find is, yes,

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:08.140
I can satisfy the equation
that's given to me,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.457
provide the number
z_0,

00:24:10.457 --> 00:24:13.309
the number in front of it will
obey condition.

00:24:13.309 --> 00:24:17.789
That's trivially solved,
because we all know how to get

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.969
the solution to that one.
z_0 is

00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:23.419
obtained by dividing both sides
by everything that multiplies

00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:25.671
z_0,
which happens to be

00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:29.149
ω_0^(2) minus
ω square plus

00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:30.220
iωγ.

00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:44.260
So, the beautiful property of
the exponential function is that

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.640
you take what is a differential
equation and you turn it into an

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.124
algebraic equation.
Because the act of taking

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:55.440
derivatives generally is a nasty
operation.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.964
Sines become cosines,
x cubed,

00:24:56.964 --> 00:24:59.629
becomes three x square.
But exponential remains

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:01.446
exponential.
That's the property you're

00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:03.869
trying to exploit here.
So now, we've got

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:06.980
z_0 to be this
one.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.036
And z itself,
the complex function I'm

00:25:11.036 --> 00:25:14.631
looking for is
F_0 over

00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:18.608
m,
e to the iωt,

00:25:18.608 --> 00:25:22.279
divided by this quantity
downstairs.

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:27.769
This quantity downstairs I'm
going to call I(ω).

00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:31.109
I(ω) is a complex
number.

00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:34.579
It's got a real part and an
imaginary part.

00:25:34.579 --> 00:25:36.664
The real part is
ω_0^(2) -

00:25:36.664 --> 00:25:39.422
ω^(2).
The imaginary part is

00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:42.585
ωγ.
It's not a fixed complex

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:47.299
number, but every frequency of
the driving force ω,

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:49.595
it is a different complex
number, but if it's sitting at

00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:51.140
one frequency of the driving
force,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.777
it's a particular number.
Everyone should know how to

00:25:53.777 --> 00:25:55.486
work it out.
ω_0 is the

00:25:55.486 --> 00:25:58.151
root of k over m;
ω is given to you,

00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:00.539
that's the real number.
γ is given to you,

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.409
that's an imaginary part.
If you actually put in numbers,

00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:05.779
it might look like six plus
five i.

00:26:05.779 --> 00:26:08.946
In the end, the thing I called
impedance or I,

00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:12.295
is just a complex number.
But it varies from frequency to

00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:14.420
frequency.
You can see that.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.910
Okay, now we've got z of
t.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.019
If the problem given to us was
z we're done.

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:23.520
You don't have to do any more
work.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.003
Here's the answer.
But we were told to take the

00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:29.148
real part of this answer because
x was the real part of

00:26:29.148 --> 00:26:31.434
the answer;
y was not part of the

00:26:31.434 --> 00:26:33.299
game.
How do you take the real part?

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:36.825
Your temptation may be well,
e to the iωt is

00:26:36.825 --> 00:26:40.350
cos ωt plus i sine
ωt, so drop the i sin

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.810
ωt.
But that would not be right.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:49.279
Now, why is that not right?
Anyone know why that's not the

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:53.110
way to get the real part yet?
Yep?

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.624
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:26:55.624 --> 00:26:57.809
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar Yes.

00:26:57.809 --> 00:27:00.320
This number downstairs is not a
real number.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.378
It's a complex number.
So, if you have a complex

00:27:03.378 --> 00:27:05.386
number on the top,
divided by the complex number

00:27:05.386 --> 00:27:07.309
in the bottom,
the real part is not simply the

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:09.608
real part of the top.
You got to write the whole

00:27:09.608 --> 00:27:12.121
thing so you can clearly
separate the real and imaginary

00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:14.269
parts, and that's what I'm going
to do next.

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:18.734
Every complex number we know
can be returned as an absolute

00:27:18.734 --> 00:27:21.890
value times e to the
iφ.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.065
Right?
Every z looks like

00:27:24.065 --> 00:27:25.867
[inaudible]
e to the iθ,

00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:28.286
because then it's [inaudible]
cos θ which is

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:30.718
x,
plus i times [inaudible]

00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:33.244
which is iy.
So, every complex number can be

00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:35.970
written that way and what will
be the magnitude of this guy?

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.238
Well, by the Pythagoras'
theorem, it'll be the square of

00:27:40.238 --> 00:27:43.031
the real part,
plus the square of the

00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:47.022
imaginary part under root.
Every complex number that you

00:27:47.022 --> 00:27:50.576
have will have an absolute value
which is that square plus that

00:27:50.576 --> 00:27:53.292
square under the root,
and it'll have a phase

00:27:53.292 --> 00:27:56.500
φ, obeying the condition
tan φ,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.500
is the imaginary part divided
by the real part.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.002
I want you to realize that in a
given problem,

00:28:05.002 --> 00:28:07.570
with a given mass,
given friction,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.839
given frequency,
both these are known.

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:14.192
They're simply a magnitude and
the phase of I can by

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:17.365
found by this process.
Now, write it like that,

00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:20.118
then you get
F_0 over

00:28:20.118 --> 00:28:24.210
m, divided by the
absolute value of I,

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.852
e to the iφ,
and I got e to the iωt

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:32.140
on the top.
I'm almost there.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.717
I'm almost there because
e to the iφ in

00:28:35.717 --> 00:28:39.767
the bottom can be written as
e to the minus iφ

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:42.862
on the top.
So then, this whole thing

00:28:42.862 --> 00:28:47.861
becomes F_0 over m
divided by the absolute value of

00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:52.110
i, e to the iωt,
minus φ.

00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:58.834
Now, it's easy to take the real
part because this is cos

00:28:58.834 --> 00:29:01.312
ωt minus φ plus
i + sin ωt minus

00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:03.660
φ.
These are all real numbers.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.660
So, they'll just multiply the
whole thing.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.525
But the real to imaginary
separation now comes from just

00:29:08.525 --> 00:29:10.870
taking the cosine part of this
exponential.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.113
And that is our final answer.
That's the answer we've been

00:29:15.113 --> 00:29:18.992
looking for, which is x(t) is
equal to F_0

00:29:18.992 --> 00:29:22.137
over m,
divided absolute value of

00:29:22.137 --> 00:29:25.190
I, cos ωt -
φ.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.589
Why did we go through the whole
business of complex numbers?

00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:41.802
We went there because the
answer is not a cosine and it's

00:29:41.802 --> 00:29:45.391
not a sine.
Cos ωt - φ,

00:29:45.391 --> 00:29:50.034
if you know your trigonometry,
is cos ωt,

00:29:50.034 --> 00:29:54.000
cos φ - sin ωt sin
φ.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.258
So, cos ωt has got some
sin ωt and that's why

00:29:57.258 --> 00:30:00.948
it's hard to guess that answer.
But if you go through complex

00:30:00.948 --> 00:30:03.240
numbers, it comes out very
easily.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.071
So, the next thing is to
analyze the properties of the

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:10.911
answer you got.
You can write this whole thing

00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:15.611
in front as some overall
amplitude x_0 cos

00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:20.312
ωt - φ and you ask,
"What does this function look

00:30:20.312 --> 00:30:22.717
like?"
Well, this function is obvious

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:24.309
to all of you,
it's oscillating.

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:27.627
Notice that even though it is
oscillating like a cosine,

00:30:27.627 --> 00:30:30.160
it's not in step with the
applied force.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.420
The applied force is cos
ωt.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.958
Its maximum occurs at
0,2π,

00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:38.195
4π, et cetera.
This guy's maximum occurs

00:30:38.195 --> 00:30:40.766
somewhat later.
The first maximum occurs when

00:30:40.766 --> 00:30:43.506
ωt = φ.
So, it's said to be lagging the

00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:45.420
function.
You can imagine two functions

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.819
oscillating.
One is behind the other one.

00:30:47.819 --> 00:30:49.670
It reaches the maximum slightly
later.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.326
So, the first property is in a
driven oscillator,

00:30:52.326 --> 00:30:55.260
the x will not be in
step with the F.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.856
It will be lagging.
Or, it could be leading depends

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:01.194
on what φ is.
Then, what about the amplitude

00:31:01.194 --> 00:31:03.589
of oscillation?
That's the thing that's very

00:31:03.589 --> 00:31:06.200
interesting.
How big is the oscillation?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.300
It looks like
F_0 over

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.230
m divided by the absolute
value of I.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.530
Let me write the absolute value
of I for you.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.463
So, the amplitude of
oscillation depends on the

00:31:23.463 --> 00:31:26.549
frequency.
You've got to draw the graph.

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:28.470
That's the function of
frequency.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.680
What does the one over this
look like?

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.377
Pardon me?
Student: [inaudible]

00:31:35.377 --> 00:31:38.089
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:40.940
but (A minus B)^(2) = (B minus
A)^(2);

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.130
that's why I've not been paying
attention.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:47.631
Okay.
Yeah, so I'm pretty careless on

00:31:47.631 --> 00:31:49.677
what I put in,
but this is one occasion where

00:31:49.677 --> 00:31:52.349
I sort of know it's okay.
I'm going to square this,

00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:55.747
I don't have to remember who is
ω_0 and who's

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:58.416
ω.
I have to be very careful where

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:02.569
I don't square things like here.
But if I'm squaring it,

00:32:02.569 --> 00:32:07.161
it doesn't matter.
Okay, so go back here and plot

00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:11.483
something divided by this
denominator and ask,

00:32:11.483 --> 00:32:15.230
"What is it at various
frequencies?"

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.303
When ω is 0,
that goes away,

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.235
that goes away,
you get

00:32:20.235 --> 00:32:24.793
ω_0^(2),
and ω_0^(2)

00:32:24.793 --> 00:32:28.508
is k over m,
and I claim what you will find

00:32:28.508 --> 00:32:32.091
initially is this will become
F_0 over

00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:35.227
k.
That'll be the value of this

00:32:35.227 --> 00:32:40.363
whole amplitude at 0 frequency.
I hope that makes a lot of

00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:43.095
sense to you.
Zero frequency means the force

00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:45.579
of not even oscillating.
It's a constant force.

00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:47.210
What x are you going to
get?

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.690
You're going to get the force
divided by the force constant.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.690
That's the x to which
you'll pull the spring.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.619
That's why if you put all the
ωs and masses back into

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:56.475
their proper place,
you'll find there's

00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:58.380
F_0 over
k.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.229
Then what happens is as
ω increases,

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:03.549
this denominator,
one of these guys,

00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:06.200
a denominator is starting to
vanish.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.195
If γ were a very,
very tiny number,

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.619
when ω_0 =
ω,

00:33:11.619 --> 00:33:14.658
you will be dividing by a very
small number and the answer will

00:33:14.658 --> 00:33:16.742
have a huge rise.
Then, you can see when

00:33:16.742 --> 00:33:19.258
ω goes to infinity,
very large ω,

00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:22.035
you're diving by ω
square, it'll fall off like

00:33:22.035 --> 00:33:22.560
this.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:30.350
Now, one of the homework
problems is to find out exactly

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.790
where it peaks.
But if γ is very small,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.530
you don't have to do much work
to know it peaks at ω =

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.029
ω_0,
but otherwise it's near that.

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:40.840
That's the phenomenon that's
called resonance.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.275
Resonance is the following.
You are applying a force,

00:33:45.275 --> 00:33:48.925
F_0 cos ωt.
You go on varying the frequency

00:33:48.925 --> 00:33:52.680
and in response to your force,
the system oscillates.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.531
The amplitude of oscillation is
the largest when the applied

00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:59.599
frequency is very near the
natural frequency.

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:02.415
If you take the limit of a very
small γ,

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:05.650
this maximum is very close to
ω_0.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.364
That's called resonance.
If γ is really tiny,

00:34:09.364 --> 00:34:13.309
you can get graphs where it's
incredibly peaked.

00:34:13.309 --> 00:34:17.980
So, that's when systems start
vibrating a lot.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.541
That's why when your car goes
over certain bumps,

00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.996
they're periodic,
they're hitting your car at a

00:34:22.996 --> 00:34:25.411
certain frequency,
and if that frequency is

00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:28.255
anywhere near the natural
frequency or vibration of your

00:34:28.255 --> 00:34:31.969
suspension system in the car,
the car begins to resonate.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:35.878
There's this famous bridge in
Tacoma that was getting hit by

00:34:35.878 --> 00:34:40.250
these winds, they were coming at
some frequency and by bad luck,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.780
they coincided with the natural
frequency of the bridge.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.488
So, there is this famous movie
made for high school,

00:34:45.488 --> 00:34:48.461
in which the bridge oscillates
more and more and more and

00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:51.389
twists and turns and collapses.
That's another example of

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.697
resonance.
People always say,

00:34:52.697 --> 00:34:55.210
"Yeah I can resonate with what
the person is saying."

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.103
What does that mean?
A person is saying whatever the

00:34:58.103 --> 00:34:59.691
hell he wants.
Some people think it's

00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:01.510
interesting and some people
think it's boring.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.884
It's the same thing here.
The force is acting at a

00:35:03.884 --> 00:35:06.351
certain frequency.
If your natural frequency is

00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:08.620
close to that,
your response is high.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.070
If it's low, you don't care.
Same thing.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.360
That's mechanical systems
selecting a frequency.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.510
In fact, this is how radios
work.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.738
You have a radio,
if there's only one radio

00:35:19.738 --> 00:35:22.975
station, you build an electrical
circuit in which the currents

00:35:22.975 --> 00:35:25.681
like to go back and forth and
oscillate at a certain

00:35:25.681 --> 00:35:27.768
frequency,
a radio station should send

00:35:27.768 --> 00:35:30.153
signals at that frequency,
your response will be very

00:35:30.153 --> 00:35:32.196
high.
But what if there's more than

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:34.740
one radio station,
which is a fact of life?

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.611
What do they do?
What they do is each one sends

00:35:37.611 --> 00:35:39.690
a signal at a different
frequency.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:44.260
You take your radio and there
are dials inside.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.233
Well, I forgot,
do you kids--do you know what a

00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:49.706
dial is?
You're not just pushing some

00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:52.155
other button.
There is a time when you had to

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:53.785
turn a dial.
When you turn a dial,

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:56.554
you're changing the properties
of the electrical circuit and

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:59.637
changing its natural frequency.
You move the natural frequency

00:35:59.637 --> 00:36:02.463
until it lines up with the
frequency of the radio station,

00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:05.371
with one particular station.
Then, the response from that

00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:07.920
station is very high and that's
the sound you hear.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.147
Other stations are also
present, but you're not near

00:36:11.147 --> 00:36:13.108
their maximum,
they are sitting,

00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:15.639
some right here and some right
here.

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:19.619
So, you want the station
frequency to come under this

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:22.769
resonance peak.
So, if you've got a bad radio,

00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:26.531
it will pick up sound from many
stations because it's not very

00:36:26.531 --> 00:36:28.190
refined.
If the peak is broad,

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.010
you will get sound from many
stations.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.071
You want to build a system
which is very finely sensitive

00:36:33.071 --> 00:36:35.842
to the frequency.
That requires γ to be

00:36:35.842 --> 00:36:37.824
very small.
If γ is very,

00:36:37.824 --> 00:36:40.835
very small, you can see if
γ is going to 0,

00:36:40.835 --> 00:36:44.809
the denominator is one divided
by 0, it's going to be infinite.

00:36:44.809 --> 00:36:47.578
So, if γ is very tiny,
one over very tiny,

00:36:47.578 --> 00:36:50.007
is very big,
and you can get enormous spikes

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.550
in this part and that's what
people need.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:57.619
Okay, the last thing you need
to do this problem set.

00:36:57.619 --> 00:36:59.909
By the way, I know this problem
set is very nasty.

00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:02.591
Towards the end,
it got tough,

00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:06.291
you got email,
I agree with you that this

00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:11.562
whole course is somewhat more
difficult than it has always

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.389
been.
Okay?

00:37:13.389 --> 00:37:16.447
I'm aware of that fact,
and I will bear this fact in

00:37:16.447 --> 00:37:20.284
mind when you go into your final
because for some reason I wanted

00:37:20.284 --> 00:37:23.942
to use problems not in our book
but for technical reasons so I

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:26.940
got them from here or there or
made them up.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.215
They generally tend to be more
challenging and more time

00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:32.149
consuming.
So, if you thought this was a

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:33.832
tough course,
well, it's supposed to be a

00:37:33.832 --> 00:37:36.650
tough course but maybe not this
hard or not this time consuming.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.331
So, I will remember that in the
end when I make the final exam

00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:43.806
or look at your grade,
I will have to compare you not

00:37:43.806 --> 00:37:47.792
simply to your predecessors,
but I will have to cut you some

00:37:47.792 --> 00:37:51.440
slack and then compare you to
previous generations.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.042
So, this use of complex numbers
is something from which I will

00:37:57.042 --> 00:37:59.429
not, however,
back down.

00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:01.879
It turns out that yes,
you can do all of this without

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:04.000
using complex numbers.
Why?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.876
Because in the real world,
everything has got real

00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:07.720
numbers.
So, you can in fact,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.884
by an orgy of trigonometric
identities solve it with sines

00:38:11.884 --> 00:38:13.752
and cosines.
But eventually,

00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:16.583
I'll give you a problem where
you just cannot do it in a

00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:19.666
meaningful way.
The power of complex numbers is

00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:23.769
they turn differential equations
into algebraic equations.

00:38:23.769 --> 00:38:26.374
All you have to do is find the
roots of a quadratic equation,

00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:28.761
whereas what you started out
was to find a solution of a

00:38:28.761 --> 00:38:31.768
differential equation.
That advantage you will lose if

00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:35.040
you stop using complex numbers,
and when you do quantum

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.821
mechanics in the second term,
the complex numbers are in the

00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:41.869
equations of motion.
The analog of F = ma,

00:38:41.869 --> 00:38:44.070
there's an i sitting
there.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.449
So, you cannot escape the
i.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:50.206
It's there, so I'm saying,
depending on how much exposure

00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:53.360
you've had, you have to do more
or less work,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.969
but you just got to get used to
complex numbers.

00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:56.904
You got to get used to the
absolute value,

00:38:56.904 --> 00:38:58.650
the phase angle,
how to manipulate.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.007
If you already know it, good.
If you don't know it,

00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.585
you have to do more work than
other people but I'm not going

00:39:04.585 --> 00:39:06.159
to let off on it.
Yes?

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:07.790
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.814
Shankar: No.
Anything you need to know with

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:12.662
differential equations is what
I've done for you in the class

00:39:12.662 --> 00:39:13.809
today.
That's it.

00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:16.832
That's the only part you know,
and with complex numbers,

00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:19.030
you turned it into ordinary
equations.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.960
So, you have to go over these
steps and work them out.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.420
That's the part I cannot do for
you.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.650
That's something you have to do.
Alright, what is finally

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.090
missing is that x of
t;

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.513
if I wrote for you what I wrote
above, which is

00:39:32.513 --> 00:39:34.936
x_0,
I don't want to write the

00:39:34.936 --> 00:39:37.718
x_0 again.
It's F_0 over

00:39:37.718 --> 00:39:39.258
mi;
maybe I'll write the whole

00:39:39.258 --> 00:39:41.190
thing.
F_0 over

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.843
m, divided by absolute
value i times cosine

00:39:44.843 --> 00:39:48.136
ωt minus φ.
It turns out this is not the

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:51.190
full answer to the question of
what happens when I push a mass.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.116
Let's understand why.
Suppose I go this mass and

00:39:55.116 --> 00:39:57.527
spring system.
I grab at a t = 0 and

00:39:57.527 --> 00:40:00.224
start shaking it.
Well, at t = 0,

00:40:00.224 --> 00:40:04.619
x was 0 because I
grabbed it at t = 0.

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.502
But a t = 0,
if I go to this solution,

00:40:07.502 --> 00:40:09.974
it's not giving me 0.
It's saying it's

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:13.050
F_0 over mi
cos φ.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.297
So, what happened to the
freedom I had to assign the

00:40:16.297 --> 00:40:18.590
velocity and position
arbitrarily?

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.780
Well, it turns out that I can
still do that.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.907
That's because this solution
has got a part that's actually

00:40:25.907 --> 00:40:29.964
missing, and the part that's
missing is this complimentary

00:40:29.964 --> 00:40:32.467
solution,
Ae to the minus

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:35.692
γt over two,
cosine of ω prime

00:40:35.692 --> 00:40:38.559
t minus
φ_0.

00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:44.920
You can always add the solution
to this solution.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.793
Why is that?
Because if x obeyed a

00:40:47.793 --> 00:40:49.995
certain equation,
if I put that in,

00:40:49.995 --> 00:40:53.815
I'm saying adding this part
will not change the fact that it

00:40:53.815 --> 00:40:57.410
obeys the equation.
Let's ask ourselves why.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.066
Go back to the top line there.
x double dot +

00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:04.009
γx dot +
ω_0^(2)x,

00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:07.156
will be equal to
F_0 over m

00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:09.739
cos ωt,
if you put this in.

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:12.070
Now, what if you keep adding
this to the solution?

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.707
Will you mess it up?
Imagine adding this to the

00:41:14.707 --> 00:41:17.036
left-hand side,
but I claim on the left-hand

00:41:17.036 --> 00:41:20.447
side there'll be no extra terms
because this guy double dot plus

00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:22.458
γ,
times this guy dot,

00:41:22.458 --> 00:41:25.739
plus ω_0^(2)
times this guy is 0.

00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:29.321
This is the function which you
will say is annihilated by the

00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:31.410
operations on the left-hand
side.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:35.700
It's like saying the following.
If you want a function whose

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.079
derivative is equal to sin
x, then I'm going to say oh,

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:43.166
I know the function is minus
cos x,

00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:45.710
and you all know you can add to
that a constant.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.594
Why do you add the constant?
Why doesn't it screw up

00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:51.550
everything?
Because a derivative of a

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.264
constant is 0.
Well, here this is not a

00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:57.818
constant and yet,
the combination of derivatives

00:41:57.818 --> 00:42:01.750
appear in the equation act on
this to give you 0.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.853
That's why you can add it
without screwing up what you've

00:42:05.853 --> 00:42:07.931
done so far.
So, the way you do these

00:42:07.931 --> 00:42:10.515
problems is you first find this
function that depends on the

00:42:10.515 --> 00:42:12.775
applied force,
and you add to this solution

00:42:12.775 --> 00:42:15.049
you get for free,
even in the absence of an

00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:16.730
applied force.
Yes?

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.993
Student: What does the
x_C stand for

00:42:18.993 --> 00:42:20.097
again?
Professor Ramamurti

00:42:20.097 --> 00:42:22.162
Shankar: It's called a
complimentary function and this

00:42:22.162 --> 00:42:24.741
is called a particular solution.
This particular solution

00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:27.309
depends on the force and this is
the function.

00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:29.349
I don't know why it's called
complimentary.

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:31.379
Maybe it compliments the
answer, or it's a freebie,

00:42:31.379 --> 00:42:33.449
you don't pay for it with any
force, but it's called

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:35.925
complimentary.
But you've got to add the two

00:42:35.925 --> 00:42:39.068
to get the final answer.
So, you will still have the

00:42:39.068 --> 00:42:42.589
numbers A and φ
_0 hanging around,

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:46.125
and how do you select them?
You select them if on top of

00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:49.985
it, somebody tells you that this
driven oscillator had a certain

00:42:49.985 --> 00:42:53.110
coordinate and certain velocity
at t = 0.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.267
So, you evaluate the whole
expression of t = 0 by

00:42:56.267 --> 00:42:59.173
putting t = 0 everywhere,
you'll get one equation

00:42:59.173 --> 00:43:01.825
involving A and φ
_0 and you'll take the

00:43:01.825 --> 00:43:04.463
derivative for the velocity,
set that equal to some given

00:43:04.463 --> 00:43:05.721
number.
You get a second equation

00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:07.360
involving A and φ
_0.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.533
You'll juggle the two equations
and solve for the two numbers,

00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:12.510
A and φ
_0.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:17.050
Okay, so that is the whole
story, okay?

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.487
That's what I tried to do
yesterday, but this is not the

00:43:20.487 --> 00:43:24.050
first time it's happened to me
that I tried to go fast;

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.217
in the end I lost time because
I was not happy with the way it

00:43:28.217 --> 00:43:31.475
was explained,
and I usually come back and say

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:34.480
sorry and then do it all over
again, okay?

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.600
But there's only so much I can
do.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.932
The rest is up to you guys.
You have to do the work and you

00:43:40.932 --> 00:43:44.408
have to do more problems.
Okay, so now,

00:43:44.408 --> 00:43:48.639
we are moving off to another
topic.

00:43:48.639 --> 00:43:52.940
The other topic--Somebody was
sighing with relief.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:59.510
It's not really different.
Okay, these are waves.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.960
But I think it's going to be--I
think this probably is the

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.745
hardest point of what we're
doing in this term,

00:44:05.745 --> 00:44:08.418
at least mathematically.
Everything else we do,

00:44:08.418 --> 00:44:10.465
heat, hot water,
cold water, that kind of stuff

00:44:10.465 --> 00:44:12.949
you've done in high school,
that's all in your future,

00:44:12.949 --> 00:44:15.600
it's going to be a lot easier.
Okay.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.568
Waves.
So, everyone has a good feeling

00:44:18.568 --> 00:44:20.179
for waves.
You go to a lake;

00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:22.410
you know if you're a hit man
for the mafia,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.800
you're dropping things in with
some weight.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.889
They go down,
what's the first thing they do?

00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:31.175
When bodies are falling into
the water, it's carving out some

00:44:31.175 --> 00:44:35.603
body of water and diving in so
the water next to it dives in to

00:44:35.603 --> 00:44:37.912
fill that hole.
But then the water,

00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:40.217
even next to it,
tries to fill in the hole left

00:44:40.217 --> 00:44:43.808
behind by these guys.
For you, it looks like a bunch

00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:47.550
of ripples traveling outwards
from the center.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.829
So, this is the classic example
of a wave.

00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:52.106
If you've got one example,
you can latch onto it every

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.825
time I say wave.
So, what's the wave in this

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:59.219
problem is that if I draw a plot
of the height of the water,

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:03.157
versus the place where it
dropped, the rock--maybe I

00:45:03.157 --> 00:45:06.502
should do a top view here.
This is the top view,

00:45:06.502 --> 00:45:09.713
after a while you've got these
ripples emanating from this

00:45:09.713 --> 00:45:12.281
point.
Or, if you kept your eye next

00:45:12.281 --> 00:45:16.760
to the water you will find these
ups and downs going outwards.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.830
So, the wave is some
displacement of a medium.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.922
That's what people say.
That's not a perfect definition

00:45:23.922 --> 00:45:27.150
because we know electromagnetic
waves have no medium.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.750
They travel in a vacuum.
But I think for this purpose in

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:34.608
this course, you should imagine
waves as what happens when you

00:45:34.608 --> 00:45:38.321
excite a medium.
So, here's the way to think

00:45:38.321 --> 00:45:41.054
about the wave.
You all understand the harmonic

00:45:41.054 --> 00:45:42.300
oscillator pretty well,
right?

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.435
Mass and spring system in
equilibrium will sit there

00:45:45.435 --> 00:45:47.807
forever.
If you give it a kick,

00:45:47.807 --> 00:45:52.199
it'll start vibrating around
its equilibrium position.

00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:55.541
There, you have to keep track
of only one variable x,

00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:57.579
which is the location of the
mass.

00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:01.080
The wave is an oscillation of a
medium that means that every

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.929
point in space there is
something that's ready to

00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:06.656
oscillate.
So, you start out a system with

00:46:06.656 --> 00:46:10.205
infinite number of degrees of
freedom because the height of

00:46:10.205 --> 00:46:13.510
the water at each point is an
independent variable.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:15.160
It can jump up and down with
time.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.485
And that's what is oscillating.
So, if you don't do anything to

00:46:19.485 --> 00:46:23.442
the water, it'll stay at the
height, but if you fiddle with

00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:26.433
it or drop something,
you hit it with something,

00:46:26.433 --> 00:46:30.201
it'll start vibrating.
But except it's a vibration not

00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:34.929
out of one variable but of a
variable in space and time.

00:46:34.929 --> 00:46:38.208
x was a function of time
and the name we use for the

00:46:38.208 --> 00:46:41.035
wave, if something is
oscillating such as the water

00:46:41.035 --> 00:46:43.239
measured from some point,
x.

00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:46.463
I'm going to use the symbol
ψ of x [and t]

00:46:46.463 --> 00:46:49.744
to denote the height of the
water from its normal position

00:46:49.744 --> 00:46:52.219
at the point x at time
t.

00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:55.660
So, x is not a dynamical
variable here.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.112
x labels the point.
Ψ is the dynamical

00:46:58.112 --> 00:47:00.116
variable.
Ψ is the thing jumping

00:47:00.116 --> 00:47:03.429
up and down.
Okay.

00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:05.369
Now, there are two kinds of
waves;

00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:08.750
there's the longitudinal wave
and the transverse wave.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:13.787
And we define them as follows.
The wave travels out with some

00:47:13.787 --> 00:47:16.337
velocity.
I'm going to use the symbol

00:47:16.337 --> 00:47:19.019
v for the velocity of the
wave.

00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:22.197
That's something for which all
of you would have intuitive

00:47:22.197 --> 00:47:25.039
understanding so no need to mess
it up right now.

00:47:25.039 --> 00:47:26.687
You go to the lake,
you drop a rock,

00:47:26.687 --> 00:47:29.559
you see when the waves get to
the shore, you take the distance

00:47:29.559 --> 00:47:31.489
divided by time,
that's the velocity.

00:47:31.489 --> 00:47:34.024
In sound, you know,
you light up a firecracker,

00:47:34.024 --> 00:47:35.456
after a while,
you hear it,

00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:38.707
you can see how long it took
and how far you are and you can

00:47:38.707 --> 00:47:41.674
find the velocity.
That's the velocity of sound in

00:47:41.674 --> 00:47:43.920
air.
And all these velocities are

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.103
all variable.
Unlike the velocity of light

00:47:46.103 --> 00:47:47.849
that doesn't seem to depend on
anything.

00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:52.170
All other velocities depend on
various conditions.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.492
The velocity of sound depends
on the temperature,

00:47:54.492 --> 00:47:56.873
for example.
Or you can take the following

00:47:56.873 --> 00:48:00.513
thing, you can take an iron rod,
which you know is made up of a

00:48:00.513 --> 00:48:03.920
lot of atoms and you take a
hammer and you hit it here.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.261
You basically compress these
atoms and they compress the

00:48:07.261 --> 00:48:10.724
atoms next to them and the
shockwaves travels through this

00:48:10.724 --> 00:48:12.920
rod;
that's also called sound.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.690
That travels at a speed which
is much faster than the speed of

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.667
sound and air.
But it's technically also

00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:22.297
called sound.
If you were a creature living

00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:25.070
inside the iron bar,
you would think of it as sound.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.889
Now, here's another way you can
hear it.

00:48:26.889 --> 00:48:29.780
For example,
here's a standard example.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.346
Here's the railway track,
and there is some kind of a

00:48:33.346 --> 00:48:36.295
mountain here,
and you are over here and the

00:48:36.295 --> 00:48:39.112
train is coming here.
It turns out,

00:48:39.112 --> 00:48:44.031
if the train lets out a sound,
the sound will travel around

00:48:44.031 --> 00:48:47.586
the bend and you will hear it.
But actually,

00:48:47.586 --> 00:48:50.493
the pounding of the train on
the tracks will set up

00:48:50.493 --> 00:48:54.157
shockwaves in the track that you
can hear by putting your ear to

00:48:54.157 --> 00:48:56.505
the track.
And you will hear the train

00:48:56.505 --> 00:48:59.291
before you hear it by,
depending on the sound coming

00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:01.820
through the air,
because the waves going through

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.138
the solids travel much faster.
Okay, so I would recommend that

00:49:05.138 --> 00:49:08.265
if you're going to do this,
you do this somewhere here

00:49:08.265 --> 00:49:11.746
because you won't have enough
time to move if you do it here

00:49:11.746 --> 00:49:14.582
[laughter].
So, most of the things--please

00:49:14.582 --> 00:49:17.485
don't do this at home,
this should be done by a

00:49:17.485 --> 00:49:20.639
trained person but I certainly
did it as a kid,

00:49:20.639 --> 00:49:23.924
listened for trains before they
come around the bend and you can

00:49:23.924 --> 00:49:25.947
actually hear the track.
Or in water,

00:49:25.947 --> 00:49:28.786
the explosions in water,
you can hear them faster if

00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:32.237
you're under the water than if
you're outside the water because

00:49:32.237 --> 00:49:35.019
the waves travel faster in water
than in air.

00:49:35.019 --> 00:49:38.260
Thunder and lightning is the
most famous example.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.056
Something happens in the sky,
the lights get to you first,

00:49:41.056 --> 00:49:43.701
and the sound gets to you;
they're traveling at different

00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:46.139
velocities.
Okay.

00:49:46.139 --> 00:49:48.820
So now, let's talk about
longitudinal transverse waves.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.519
When I talk to you,
I think you sort of know what

00:49:52.519 --> 00:49:55.175
happens.
The air in this room is at some

00:49:55.175 --> 00:49:58.764
pressure, and that pressure is
constant, and the pressure is

00:49:58.764 --> 00:50:02.354
pushing your eardrum from the
outside and going through your

00:50:02.354 --> 00:50:05.699
Eustachian canal pushing the
drum from the inside,

00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:08.389
and the two pressures balance
and you don't feel anything.

00:50:08.389 --> 00:50:13.539
If I talk, the vocal chords
move back and forth and they

00:50:13.539 --> 00:50:17.940
increase and decrease the
pressure as I talk.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.664
If I push out,
I increase the pressure,

00:50:19.664 --> 00:50:21.888
if I go backwards,
I decompress the air and reduce

00:50:21.888 --> 00:50:24.571
the pressure.
Those shockwaves propagate to

00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:26.495
your ear.
They hit your eardrum,

00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:29.831
but the eardrum is getting the
pressure difference from the

00:50:29.831 --> 00:50:32.420
outside, but the inside pressure
is fixed.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.991
So, what happens is when I
decompress, the eardrum comes

00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:38.886
out and goes in.
It goes back and forth and the

00:50:38.886 --> 00:50:41.761
eardrum moves.
Then, behind the eardrum are

00:50:41.761 --> 00:50:45.209
the little bones,
and then the bones go and there

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:49.159
is a tube and the doctors take
over from this point.

00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:52.670
So, some loose hair is shaking
in this fluid;

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:56.170
then, it picks up some nervous
things and goes to your brain.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:59.272
Then, you figure out and
actually know what the person's

00:50:59.272 --> 00:51:01.300
saying.
You don't know why he's talking

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.146
in this particular fashion,
but you can at least understand

00:51:04.146 --> 00:51:06.361
and translate.
That's a long chain of

00:51:06.361 --> 00:51:10.191
transducers of energy from sound
to the stuff in your ear into

00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:13.659
your brain.
I draw the line at the eardrum.

00:51:13.659 --> 00:51:17.074
I don't want to go on the other
side of the eardrum because it's

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:20.199
very shaky turf.
But this part I know very well.

00:51:20.199 --> 00:51:24.241
It's a sound wave and it's a
longitudinal wave for the

00:51:24.241 --> 00:51:27.052
following reason.
If you look at the pressure

00:51:27.052 --> 00:51:29.575
waves, the molecules of
air--they're going back and

00:51:29.575 --> 00:51:30.971
forth,
follow my hands,

00:51:30.971 --> 00:51:34.500
and the signal from me to you
is also going from me to you,

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.860
so the motion is in line with
the velocity.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.938
The motion of the medium is in
the same direction as the motion

00:51:40.938 --> 00:51:44.049
of the wave.
A transverse wave is what you

00:51:44.049 --> 00:51:47.219
find in water if you are--or on
a string.

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:49.345
Take a string,
clamp down that end and you

00:51:49.345 --> 00:51:51.159
give it a little flick like
that.

00:51:51.159 --> 00:51:54.260
This bump after a while will
end up here.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.469
So, the rope is moving,
transfers but the velocity if

00:51:57.469 --> 00:52:01.942
the signal is to the right.
So, do not confuse the motion

00:52:01.942 --> 00:52:06.659
of the medium with the motion of
the signal, okay?

00:52:06.659 --> 00:52:10.001
The rope, at any given point,
is either at rest or going up

00:52:10.001 --> 00:52:13.170
and down, but the signal is
going from left to right.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:17.061
So, the medium doesn't have to
actually move in the direction

00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:18.618
of the wave.
For example,

00:52:18.618 --> 00:52:21.700
if a bunch of people line up
and each one tells the person

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.512
next to the next person some
secret and the secret is

00:52:24.512 --> 00:52:27.270
eventually transmitted all the
way to the end,

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.942
what has traveled is a secret.
The actual person in the first

00:52:30.942 --> 00:52:33.469
place has not gone over
physically to the end.

00:52:33.469 --> 00:52:36.719
So, what happens is as you're
sitting there not doing anything

00:52:36.719 --> 00:52:39.496
and suddenly you hear something,
you pass it on to the next

00:52:39.496 --> 00:52:41.280
person, then you've gone back to
doing nothing.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.978
Then, the signal travels.
That's what will happen in the

00:52:43.978 --> 00:52:45.702
rope here.
This section of the rope is not

00:52:45.702 --> 00:52:47.458
doing anything.
When this pulse hits it,

00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:49.090
it'll jump up and down for a
while.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:52.199
Then it'll quiet down and
somebody to the right will start

00:52:52.199 --> 00:52:54.406
moving.
Okay, so there are the examples

00:52:54.406 --> 00:52:56.510
of longitudinal and transverse
waves.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:01.679
So, we have the notion of
velocity.

00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:05.859
Now, I want to consider one
concrete example of a wave,

00:53:05.859 --> 00:53:10.271
so you people have a good
feeling of how to study waves in

00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:11.200
physics.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.309
So, there are many, many waves.
Water waves,

00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:21.270
electromagnetic waves,
elastic waves.

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:24.033
I'm going to do one.
I think to do one thing in some

00:53:24.033 --> 00:53:27.219
depth will give you a feeling
for how we analyze waves.

00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:29.409
That's going to be waves on a
string.

00:53:29.409 --> 00:53:32.945
So, you have to imagine that I
have a string that's been

00:53:32.945 --> 00:53:36.073
clamped at two ends,
and somebody plucks the string,

00:53:36.073 --> 00:53:39.225
say, into that shape and lets
it go, we know the string is

00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:42.887
going to vibrate back and forth.
Now, let's measure the

00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:46.419
coordinate x,
which is the point on the

00:53:46.419 --> 00:53:50.893
string, and ψ is the
displacement of the string at

00:53:50.893 --> 00:53:53.845
that point.
You guys got that this is

00:53:53.845 --> 00:53:56.830
really the x,
this is not my string.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:59.842
That is my string.
Each point is labeled by an

00:53:59.842 --> 00:54:03.476
x value that it will have
for the string to relax to the

00:54:03.476 --> 00:54:06.244
normal position.
So, we are asking what is the

00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:08.982
displacement of the string at
the point x,

00:54:08.982 --> 00:54:11.417
at time, t.
So, ψ is our new

00:54:11.417 --> 00:54:13.944
dynamical variable,
namely, the variable for which

00:54:13.944 --> 00:54:16.780
we like to write the equations
governing its motion.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:19.420
And we want to ask how does
ψ vary with time?

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.865
What will it do?
If I start it out,

00:54:22.865 --> 00:54:25.941
what will it do?
Do you understand the parallel

00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:29.164
to the mass and spring system?
The mass and spring system,

00:54:29.164 --> 00:54:32.465
you got a mass and you got a
spring, you pull the mass out to

00:54:32.465 --> 00:54:35.106
some new location,
you let it go and you want to

00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:38.199
know what it does.
The answer was cos ωt.

00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:42.087
Now, at every point x,
I have some string,

00:54:42.087 --> 00:54:46.298
and I displace all those
degrees of freedom and I let

00:54:46.298 --> 00:54:48.258
them go,
and they're going to do

00:54:48.258 --> 00:54:50.579
something and I want to know how
they're all varying.

00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:52.806
So previously,
we had only one coordinate

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:55.590
which I called x,
which varied with time.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.697
Now with every point,
x, I have a coordinate

00:54:58.697 --> 00:55:02.123
ψ that varies with time.
And our job is to find the

00:55:02.123 --> 00:55:03.790
equation satisfied by ψ.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.766
So, let us take a string and
the string has to be under some

00:55:12.766 --> 00:55:14.406
tension.
That means you hang some

00:55:14.406 --> 00:55:16.849
weights on the end or you
tighten it with some screws.

00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:20.594
There's a tension so that the
string is dying to break apart

00:55:20.594 --> 00:55:23.045
if you cut it.
So, T is the tension on

00:55:23.045 --> 00:55:25.589
the string.
Without the tension none of

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:28.409
this would work.
So, here is the string.

00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:36.284
And I'm going to analyze the
fate of a tiny segment of length

00:55:36.284 --> 00:55:37.860
dx.

00:55:42.019 --> 00:55:45.724
An essential parameter here is
called--which is μ,

00:55:45.724 --> 00:55:49.333
the mass per unit length.
That means you put the string

00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:52.336
on a weighing machine,
you find the mass and you

00:55:52.336 --> 00:55:54.618
divide by the length.
For example,

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:58.049
if you've got a ten meter
string and it weighs one-tenth

00:55:58.049 --> 00:56:00.912
of a kilogram,
then the mass per unit length

00:56:00.912 --> 00:56:03.957
is one over thousand
[correction: should have said

00:56:03.957 --> 00:56:06.070
"hundred"]
kilograms per meter.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.720
And T is the tension.

00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:14.365
The textbook may use F
for tension because T is

00:56:14.365 --> 00:56:16.811
the time period also,
so it depends on what symbol

00:56:16.811 --> 00:56:19.510
they use in the book.
I'm not completely sure.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.578
I'm going to call it T
because it's been called

00:56:22.578 --> 00:56:26.371
T in the past.
Now, I pull this thing and I

00:56:26.371 --> 00:56:30.240
want to know what the whole
string will do.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.551
Who is going to tell me now?
I mean, what authority will

00:56:35.551 --> 00:56:38.020
decide the behavior of this
string?

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:43.019
What do we have to appeal to?
Yes?

00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:45.119
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:48.149
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: [inaudible]

00:56:48.149 --> 00:56:51.559
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Very good.

00:56:51.559 --> 00:56:53.601
So, he said,
find the force that will return

00:56:53.601 --> 00:56:56.545
it to the original position and
what was the it that you

00:56:56.545 --> 00:56:58.034
mentioned?
Student: [inaudible]

00:56:58.034 --> 00:56:59.469
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:56:59.469 --> 00:57:06.293
Right, but we are going to
apply--yes, any other answers

00:57:06.293 --> 00:57:08.860
before I go?
Yes.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:16.364
Student: Can't you model
the motion of the string by

00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:22.187
saying that [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:57:22.187 --> 00:57:28.140
Shankar: Yeah,
it will look like that.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.942
That is correct.
But all I want you to

00:57:30.942 --> 00:57:34.614
understand is,
there are no new laws that I'm

00:57:34.614 --> 00:57:37.157
going to invoke.
I'm not going to say,

00:57:37.157 --> 00:57:39.618
well, we studied masses and
springs, today it's time to

00:57:39.618 --> 00:57:42.490
study strings and I'm going to
tell you a new law of motion.

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.889
There's only one law of motion.
That's F = ma.

00:57:45.889 --> 00:57:48.686
The whole purpose of my
exercise now is to show you that

00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:51.280
really does control,
that's why it's a super law.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.543
Everything mechanical follows
from that law and I want to show

00:57:54.543 --> 00:57:57.860
you F = ma is all I have
and I've got to use it properly

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.909
and that's going to tell me what
the strings will do.

00:58:00.909 --> 00:58:03.372
So, what I do is--The string
is, of course,

00:58:03.372 --> 00:58:06.010
a long and extended and
complicated object.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:09.286
I isolate a portion of it,
of length dx,

00:58:09.286 --> 00:58:12.920
and I'm going to apply F =
ma to that guy.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.370
All I need to know if the
F, the total force on it,

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:19.760
and I'm going to equate it to
mass times acceleration.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:24.438
Okay now, this force on the
little segment is the tension

00:58:24.438 --> 00:58:28.281
pulling this way,
the same tension pulling that

00:58:28.281 --> 00:58:30.060
way.
The tension on the string

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.659
doesn't change from point to
point.

00:58:31.659 --> 00:58:35.746
But the angle at which it is
pulling is not necessarily the

00:58:35.746 --> 00:58:38.613
same.
Here, there is some angle

00:58:38.613 --> 00:58:43.455
θ + Δθ,
and here, there is an angle

00:58:43.455 --> 00:58:46.926
θ.
This force is at an angle,

00:58:46.926 --> 00:58:51.313
say, θ below the
horizontal, this is pulling

00:58:51.313 --> 00:58:56.139
about θ + Δθ.
So, the string is curving;

00:58:56.139 --> 00:58:59.526
therefore, the tangent to the
string at this end and that end

00:58:59.526 --> 00:59:02.010
are not quite the same and
that's the key.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.929
Because if they were exactly
the same, the same tension on

00:59:04.929 --> 00:59:06.978
the two ends,
if you take any object like

00:59:06.978 --> 00:59:09.130
this and apply exactly the same
force,

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.214
they will cancel because
they're opposite forces,

00:59:12.214 --> 00:59:14.850
and F is 0,
ma will be 0,

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:17.686
and this thing won't move.
The reason it moves is because

00:59:17.686 --> 00:59:20.213
even though the magnitude of the
force is the same,

00:59:20.213 --> 00:59:22.739
the angle at which it's acting
is not the same.

00:59:22.739 --> 00:59:26.310
So, I'm going to find out the
vertical component of the force

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:29.346
here and take the difference
from there [pointing at

00:59:29.346 --> 00:59:33.318
picture].
So, the force here will be

00:59:33.318 --> 00:59:37.500
T times sin +
Δθ.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.349
θ is the angle with the
horizontal.

00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:46.332
And the force on the other side
will be T times sin

00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:48.811
θ.
θ is the angle made by

00:59:48.811 --> 00:59:51.987
the string from the horizontal,
and that angle is simply

00:59:51.987 --> 00:59:56.731
changing over this tiny length.
Next approximation--that's the

00:59:56.731 --> 00:59:59.686
force.
That's going to be mass times

00:59:59.686 --> 01:00:02.714
acceleration.
Mass of this little segment is

01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:05.777
the mass per unit length,
times the length of the

01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:09.360
segment.
Now, what is the acceleration

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.170
in the language of calculus?
What is the acceleration here?

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:15.514
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:00:15.514 --> 01:00:17.235
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: [inaudible]

01:00:17.235 --> 01:00:18.692
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah,

01:00:18.692 --> 01:00:20.380
he said d^(2)x over
dt^(2),

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.530
but the d by
dt^(2) is right.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.994
It's not d^(2) of
x of ψ because

01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:28.739
you've got to understand--I
think--Look,

01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:31.868
this was not a fair trick,
but you have to be aware that

01:00:31.868 --> 01:00:35.110
what is oscillating up and down
is the coordinate side.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.780
x is not a real
dynamical coordinate.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.349
x is a label on the
string.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:43.287
What's jumping up and down is
ψ, so the acceleration

01:00:43.287 --> 01:00:46.510
is the second derivative,
and I write partial derivative

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.352
because ψ can vary with
x, or it can vary with

01:00:49.352 --> 01:00:51.909
time and I want to take the
second time derivative.

01:00:51.909 --> 01:00:57.011
Now, come to the left-hand side
and you assume the angles

01:00:57.011 --> 01:01:01.448
involved are very small.
If the angles involved are very

01:01:01.448 --> 01:01:04.652
small, I remind you guys of the
falling identity,

01:01:04.652 --> 01:01:07.455
sin θ begins as
θ plus dot,

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:09.916
dot, dot.
You remember the series I wrote

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.072
for you.
Cos θ is one minus

01:01:12.072 --> 01:01:15.630
θ^(2) over two,
and we have decided that we are

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:19.320
going to treat θ so
small that θ^(2),

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.398
we're not interested in.
And tan θ,

01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:25.287
which is sin θ over
cos θ,

01:01:25.287 --> 01:01:28.739
is now θ over one,
which is θ.

01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:31.778
So, small angle approximation
is sin θ,

01:01:31.778 --> 01:01:34.090
approximately equal to
θ,

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.154
cos θ approximately
equal to one,

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:38.477
tan θ may be
approximately replaced by

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:42.880
θ.
So, first nice break.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.677
We don't have to work with
sine, we just want T of

01:01:47.677 --> 01:01:52.989
θ + Δθ minus that,
which is T of θ.

01:01:52.989 --> 01:01:57.528
Δθ is a change in the
angle from the left hand of the

01:01:57.528 --> 01:02:01.099
string bit to the right end of
the string bit.

01:02:01.099 --> 01:02:03.957
Now, I got a dx here,
so what I'm going to do is

01:02:03.957 --> 01:02:06.710
divide by a dx and
multiply by a dx.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:16.449
We are almost there in deriving
the equation.

01:02:16.449 --> 01:02:19.274
Look, I've been calling it
dx and Δx so

01:02:19.274 --> 01:02:23.670
pardon that.
Just call it dx.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:28.755
μ, dx,
d^(2)ψ over

01:02:28.755 --> 01:02:33.050
dt^(2).
Now, what is θ?

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:38.053
I'm going to say θ is
the same as tan θ in the

01:02:38.053 --> 01:02:45.389
small angle approximation.
tan θ is dψ/dx.

01:02:45.389 --> 01:02:48.633
You know from the calculus,
if you move horizontally by

01:02:48.633 --> 01:02:51.457
dx and you move
vertically by dψ,

01:02:51.457 --> 01:02:53.800
dψdx is a tan of the
angle.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.130
That's one of the first things
you learned in calculus.

01:02:56.130 --> 01:03:00.807
So, this is really d by
dx of dψdx,

01:03:00.807 --> 01:03:04.900
that becomes d^(2)ψ
over dx^(2),

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.820
equal to μd^(2)ψ over
dt^(2).

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.660
Now, some of you may find the
derivation hard.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.989
Then forget about the details.
You're not responsible for that.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:22.738
But some of you may say look,
I don't ever want you to tell

01:03:22.738 --> 01:03:26.616
me something which you cannot
prove unless it's an axiom or a

01:03:26.616 --> 01:03:29.095
law of nature.
Well, this is not a new law of

01:03:29.095 --> 01:03:31.199
nature, so I have to tell you
where I got this.

01:03:31.199 --> 01:03:35.104
I got this by applying F =
ma to a tiny portion of the

01:03:35.104 --> 01:03:37.183
string.
And you can ask yourself,

01:03:37.183 --> 01:03:40.170
when you pull a string up,
why does it come down?

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.920
It comes down because there's a
tension on the string and the

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.482
tension here and the tension
here have vertical components

01:03:47.482 --> 01:03:50.278
that don't quite match.
You see the string is

01:03:50.278 --> 01:03:53.547
flattening out like this;
the vertical downward component

01:03:53.547 --> 01:03:56.853
of this is bigger than the
vertical upward component of

01:03:56.853 --> 01:03:58.996
this force.
If it is resolved into the

01:03:58.996 --> 01:04:02.115
vertical or horizontal part the
downward part is bigger than the

01:04:02.115 --> 01:04:05.284
upward part in this picture.
Therefore, there's a net force

01:04:05.284 --> 01:04:07.877
bringing you down.
That one is bringing you down

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.885
is because the derivative here
and here are not the same,

01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:12.980
because the derivative is the
slope.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.463
So, the whole thing depends on
the rate of change of the rate

01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:17.159
of change, and that's why you
get this.

01:04:17.159 --> 01:04:19.709
But the mass of the tiny
segment also depends on

01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:22.150
dx, so dx cancels
in the end.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.530
You drop it and you get this
equation.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:32.581
So, what I want you to think of
is dθ/dx is really d by

01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:35.831
dx of dψ/dx.
Well, I should actually use

01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:38.144
partial derivatives,
because ψ depends on

01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:41.172
x and t,
so if you're real careful with

01:04:41.172 --> 01:04:44.150
that, you get d^(2)ψ
over dt^(2).

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:51.510
So now, I'm going to write down
the final wave equation.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.503
From this point on,
you have to get engaged in the

01:04:54.503 --> 01:04:57.923
problem because even though you
may or may not follow the

01:04:57.923 --> 01:05:00.652
derivation,
you should know what is called

01:05:00.652 --> 01:05:04.439
a wave equation.
This is the wave equation:

01:05:04.439 --> 01:05:09.851
d^(2)ψ over
dx^(2) is equal to 1 over

01:05:09.851 --> 01:05:14.091
v^(2),
d^(2)ψ over

01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:19.978
dt^(2),
where v^(2) is equal to

01:05:19.978 --> 01:05:25.786
t over μ,
or v is square root of

01:05:25.786 --> 01:05:28.985
T over µ.
I just invented a symbol

01:05:28.985 --> 01:05:33.230
v.
This is very important.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:36.563
What you have to know is that
ψ, the displacement of

01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:40.009
the string at the point labeled
x horizontally from the

01:05:40.009 --> 01:05:42.250
left-hand,
at the time t,

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.360
varies with time according to
this equation.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.825
This is a very famous equation
and it turns out you take any

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:53.609
elastic medium and you disturb
it a little bit from

01:05:53.609 --> 01:05:56.981
equilibrium,
always seems to obey equations

01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:00.246
of this type.
So, our job from now until some

01:06:00.246 --> 01:06:04.250
time is to analyze the equation
and see what it means.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.840
What are the consequences of
this wave equation?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.460
And even though I called it
v, as units of velocity,

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:15.268
I have no right to argue that
it really is the velocity of the

01:06:15.268 --> 01:06:17.150
wave.
We'll have to find out.

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:21.368
It's got dimensions of velocity;
you can check by putting the

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.254
units in.
Okay but now,

01:06:23.254 --> 01:06:28.150
let me write down a solution to
this equation;

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:32.420
then, we'll understand what can
happen.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.925
So, this is like saying I've
got some equation,

01:06:36.925 --> 01:06:42.606
second derivative of x
is equal to some number times

01:06:42.606 --> 01:06:45.429
x,
and we said the answer is

01:06:45.429 --> 01:06:47.599
cos ωt and sin
ωt.

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.870
But now, we've got second
derivatives with the respect to

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.344
space, second derivatives with
respect to time and I know that

01:06:52.344 --> 01:06:54.250
this guy is going to oscillate
up and down.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:58.476
But it's going to oscillate,
if you imagine a string,

01:06:58.476 --> 01:07:02.947
take a string or a water wave
that is traveling back and

01:07:02.947 --> 01:07:05.019
forth;
the ripples are traveling.

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:08.344
If you took a snapshot of the
wave at a given time,

01:07:08.344 --> 01:07:11.070
it would be going up and down
in space.

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:15.173
Or if you stood at one point in
the water and have the wave go

01:07:15.173 --> 01:07:19.007
past you, the water will go up
and down in time at a given

01:07:19.007 --> 01:07:21.610
space.
You understand?

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.155
If the wave is coming towards
the shore, you stand in one

01:07:24.155 --> 01:07:27.083
place, you don't have to move.
The wave will go past you and

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:29.269
where you are,
the water will go up and down

01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:31.777
with time.
Or, if you took a picture of it

01:07:31.777 --> 01:07:34.519
at one instant,
the wave will go up and down in

01:07:34.519 --> 01:07:37.682
space at a given time.
So, waves oscillate in space

01:07:37.682 --> 01:07:40.250
and time and you have to guess
the answer.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.964
Now, if I had more time,
I can tell you guys how to

01:07:42.964 --> 01:07:45.000
deduce the answer.
It's not very hard,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.050
but I just don't have that kind
of time.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.630
So, I'm going to just write
down a solution.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.579
In fact, there are many,
many solutions to the equation.

01:07:52.579 --> 01:07:54.278
It's very general,
so I'm going to write a

01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:57.775
particular solution.
The solution I'm going to write

01:07:57.775 --> 01:08:01.813
down looks like this.
It is some number A,

01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:05.648
which is the amplitude and it
looks like cosine,

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:10.789
some number called k
times x minus ωt.

01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:13.143
Unfortunately,
this k is not a force

01:08:13.143 --> 01:08:15.079
constant.
It is a new symbol.

01:08:15.079 --> 01:08:19.278
And ω is another symbol
whose meaning we will deduce

01:08:19.278 --> 01:08:21.894
shortly.
At least you can see that I

01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:25.774
just cannot write a wave like
x - t or something,

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:29.301
because cosine should have an
argument which has no

01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:31.623
dimensions.
So, if I have an x,

01:08:31.623 --> 01:08:34.101
I should multiply it by some
number that's got units of

01:08:34.101 --> 01:08:35.949
inverse x.
And if I have a time,

01:08:35.949 --> 01:08:38.164
I should multiply it by
something that looks like a

01:08:38.164 --> 01:08:40.133
frequency.
From dimensional analysis,

01:08:40.133 --> 01:08:43.079
I look for a solution of this
form to these equations.

01:08:43.079 --> 01:08:45.452
Once again, whether you solve
it--By the way,

01:08:45.452 --> 01:08:48.310
this called a partial
differential equation because it

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:51.635
involves partial derivatives.
All I'm going to do--I'm going

01:08:51.635 --> 01:08:54.159
to be content with showing you
that this solution,

01:08:54.159 --> 01:08:56.890
when I stick it into this
equation actually works.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:00.039
Let us first verify that it
works.

01:09:00.039 --> 01:09:04.643
Then, we'll come next Monday
and analyze in detail what does

01:09:04.643 --> 01:09:07.440
this really do?
We'll come to that in a moment.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.979
Let's verify that it works.
So, let's take dψ/dx.

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:14.517
What happens when you take
dψ/dx,

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:17.625
when you take a partial
derivative with respect to

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.100
x it says forget about
time;

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:25.395
treat x as the only
variable, then you'll get -a

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:28.734
sin kx - ωt,
times the derivative of what's

01:09:28.734 --> 01:09:31.359
inside the argument which
happens to be k.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:34.575
Now, if you differentiate the
second time,

01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:38.810
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2),
you do the whole thing again;

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:47.850
then, you'll get -Ak^(2) sin
kx - ωt.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.261
Students: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:09:49.261 --> 01:09:50.334
Shankar: I'm
sorry--;yes--thank you

01:09:50.334 --> 01:09:52.000
[correction: professor changes
Ak^(2) sin kx - ωt to

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.631
Ak^(2) cos kx - ωt].
Now, if you take

01:09:55.631 --> 01:10:04.148
d^(2)ψ/dt^(2),
you will get -ω^(2) A cos

01:10:04.148 --> 01:10:08.049
kx - ωt.
If you take one over

01:10:08.049 --> 01:10:10.630
v^(2) times that,
you'll get this.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:15.798
What does the wave equation say?
It says, the second derivative

01:10:15.798 --> 01:10:18.785
of an x should be one
over v^(2) times the

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.409
second derivative in time.
And for my solution,

01:10:21.409 --> 01:10:23.510
that's a second derivative in
x;

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.650
that's a second derivative in
time;

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.810
I want them to match.
Well, they're almost there.

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:31.276
A matches A,
cosine matches the cosine,

01:10:31.276 --> 01:10:33.979
but ω and k are
not independent numbers.

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:36.860
ω over v should
be equal to k.

01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:45.836
In other words,
this wave equation for waves on

01:10:45.836 --> 01:10:49.880
a string will have solutions
that look like this,

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.398
where A can be any
number you like,

01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:55.470
k and ω,
between the two of them,

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:58.234
there is one degree of freedom.
You can pick k at will,

01:10:58.234 --> 01:11:00.675
and pick ω so that
ω will equal the

01:11:00.675 --> 01:11:02.662
kv,
or pick ω freely,

01:11:02.662 --> 01:11:05.530
and choose k so that
k is ω over

01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:07.614
v.
But there is a relation between

01:11:07.614 --> 01:11:09.557
the two of them,
which you can write in any

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:10.390
number of ways.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.140
So, let us put that knowledge
back into the solution.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.243
Let us say ω is in fact
kv, so that we write it

01:11:22.243 --> 01:11:25.042
explicitly in terms of the
k, which is completely

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:27.532
free.
So, ψ now looks like

01:11:27.532 --> 01:11:30.146
A cos,
k times x

01:11:30.146 --> 01:11:34.503
minus--;now, here is where you
guys got to do a little mental

01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:37.171
algebra here.
If I pulled the k out,

01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:40.036
can you see that t will
be multiplied by ω over

01:11:40.036 --> 01:11:42.145
k?
But ω over k is

01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:47.180
v.
So, this is my solution.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:52.030
A cos [k(x – vt)].
And that is a very pretty

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:56.207
result and I just--I will
conclude by telling you what

01:11:56.207 --> 01:12:00.123
that is telling you.
It says that ψ of

01:12:00.123 --> 01:12:04.330
xt, which depends on
x and depends on

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:06.611
t,
depends on x and

01:12:06.611 --> 01:12:09.319
t through this
combination x - vt.

01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:11.795
In other words,
if x - vt has a certain

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.939
value, ψ has a certain
value.

01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:16.824
If I change x and if I
change t,

01:12:16.824 --> 01:12:20.547
keeping x - vt constant,
the function doesn't change,

01:12:20.547 --> 01:12:23.819
right, because it's a function
only of this combination.

01:12:23.819 --> 01:12:28.590
I will argue that that really
means it's a wave that's

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:34.729
traveling at a velocity v.
Let me show you why.

01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:38.289
Let's take a function,
e to the -x^(2).

01:12:38.289 --> 01:12:40.320
You must have seen this
function in statistics.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.050
It looks like this.
It likes to have x = 0.

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:49.579
Take the function that x
is replaced by x - vt.

01:12:49.579 --> 01:12:54.439
Where does this function have
its maximum?

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:58.208
It has a maximum when this guy
on top vanishes,

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.239
that is to say,
when x = vt.

01:13:01.239 --> 01:13:04.081
So, if you took the function,
e to the (x -

01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:07.553
vt)^(2) with the minus sign,
at t = 0 it'll be here,

01:13:07.553 --> 01:13:10.350
but other time it'll be here,
but at every instant,

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:13.259
the bump will be moving to the
right, you can see with the

01:13:13.259 --> 01:13:16.118
velocity v,
because the peak is at a

01:13:16.118 --> 01:13:18.603
location vt.
So, in a wave,

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.736
the whole profile moves at a
velocity and that,

01:13:21.736 --> 01:13:25.618
for this symbol we use here is
in fact the velocity of the

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:30.384
wave.
Maybe I'll give you one extreme

01:13:30.384 --> 01:13:32.567
example.
At t = 0,

01:13:32.567 --> 01:13:35.873
it just looks like cos
kx, and we all know what

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:39.591
cos kx looks like.
It's got a maximum of x

01:13:39.591 --> 01:13:42.711
= 0.
If you wait a little longer,

01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:46.500
where is this maximum a little
later?

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.499
If you increase x a
little bit, if you increase time

01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:51.722
a little bit,
you got to increase x a

01:13:51.722 --> 01:13:54.670
little bit so that these two
still cancel each other.

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:57.960
Originally, x was at 0,
and t was at 0;

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.976
you were at a maximum.
A little later,

01:13:59.976 --> 01:14:02.347
after some time Δt,
if you go to the point

01:14:02.347 --> 01:14:04.831
Δx, so that these two
numbers cancel,

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:06.920
we are still riding the
maximum.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.489
But that means that Δx
over Δt is v.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:14.286
That means, if you move to the
right, after ψ

01:14:14.286 --> 01:14:16.329
Δt, you will ride the
crest.

01:14:16.329 --> 01:14:19.079
That means the crest is moving
at the velocity v.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:22.194
So, I think to summarize what
I've shown you so far,

01:14:22.194 --> 01:14:25.979
is that when you take a string
and you have a tension on it,

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:28.630
you pull it and let it go,
it vibrates according to this

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.740
equation;
that is the first statement.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.136
This is a solution.
I'm not telling you it's the

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.020
most general one or the only one
or anything.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.810
I want us to at least have one
concrete solution.

01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:41.678
And I've not told you yet how
to visualize the function,

01:14:41.678 --> 01:14:44.130
but I have told you whatever
the function is,

01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:48.699
it is drifting to the right at
a speed that we call v.

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:51.699
Because any function of x -
vt has a property that if

01:14:51.699 --> 01:14:53.783
[initially]
it did something x = 0,

01:14:53.783 --> 01:14:56.020
it does the same thing at x
= vt.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.899
That means the whole shape is
bodily transported to the right.

01:14:59.899 --> 01:15:02.989
So, this really signifies a
wave traveling to the right.

01:15:02.989 --> 01:15:05.831
If you wanted a wave traveling
to the left, you should put a

01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:08.000
plus here;
it'll go backwards.

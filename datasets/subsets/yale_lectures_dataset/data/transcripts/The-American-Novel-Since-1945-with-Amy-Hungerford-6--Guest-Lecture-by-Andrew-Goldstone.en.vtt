00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.752
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Today it is my

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:07.584
very great privilege and
pleasure to introduce Andrew

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:11.980
Goldstone, a TF in this course.
Andrew is going to provide for

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.044
you today the only relief you
will get all term from my voice,

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:20.212
so enjoy it!
On the syllabus it says that I

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:23.930
would be presenting a lecture on
censorship in this slot.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.809
Andrew Goldstone:
That's been suppressed,

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.741
actually.Professor Amy
Hungerford: It's been

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.060
suppressed.
That's right.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.821
So, I will talk about
censorship somewhat in my last

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.586
lecture on Lolita,
 and in preparation for

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:41.458
that, for next week I'd like you
to finish the novel and then

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.054
read his essay,
"On a Novel Entitled

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:48.430
Lolita." It should be
bound at the back of your book.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.880
Andrew is a fourth-year student
in the Ph.D.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.305
program in English,
and he is writing a

00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:57.134
dissertation on the autonomy of
the work of art in modernism:

00:00:57.134 --> 00:01:00.689
on that as a problem,
on that as a subject to be

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:05.210
questioned and understood in a
deeper way than it has been up

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.709
until now.
It's a wonderful dissertation.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.709
It prepares him very well for
the lecture he's going to give

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:12.667
you today.
So: Andrew.Andrew

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.239
Goldstone: Thanks,
Amy.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.154
So, on Monday we had three main
themes that were used to

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:22.052
introduce this novel to you.
First is the idea that the

00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:26.254
novel invites ethical questions
but also holds them off through

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:30.321
parody in the same way that it
uses the tropes of romanticism

00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.099
and romantic love and parodies
them.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.060
Secondly, we looked at
Humbert's techniques of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.140
rhetorical seduction and related
that to a kind of intellectual

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.693
problem that Nabokov sets
himself of trying to make you

00:01:43.693 --> 00:01:46.720
identify with this villainous
character.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.443
And that leads to the third big
question we looked at,

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.424
which is the place of Nabokov
in this novel amidst the many

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.448
layers,
whether he crosses them or

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:57.044
confuses them.
And that's the question that

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.300
I'm mostly going to focus on
today.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.763
I'm going to bracket the
ethical question,

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:04.947
leave that for Monday's
lecture, and the way I want to

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:08.252
approach this question of the
style in the novel and the

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:11.857
question of aestheticism is by
placing Nabokov in the context

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:15.404
of literary modernism.
So, I'm going to outline for

00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:19.329
you a little bit what I mean by
that term, and then I'm going to

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.631
look at some specific
predecessors that Nabokov refers

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.849
to,
and the way he uses them.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.961
And then, at the very end,
I'm going to try to connect

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.840
that to Nabokov's exile and the
themes of exile.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.259
So, let's start with an
example.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.570
If you look on page 15,
Humbert describes his

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.510
adolescence, his education:

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.629
At first I planned to
take a degree in psychiatry as

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.970
many manqué
talents do;

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.650
but I was even more
manqué

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.313
than that;
a peculiar exhaustion--I am so

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:01.770
oppressed, doctor--set in,
and I switched to English

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.567
literature,
where so many frustrated poets

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:07.030
end as pipe-smoking teachers in
tweeds.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.837
[Well, that's why I'm in
graduate school!]

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:12.618
Paris suited me.
I discussed Soviet movies with

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:15.094
expatriates.
I sat with uranists in the Deux

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.185
Magots.
I published tortuous essays in

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:19.964
obscure journals.
I composed pastiches:

00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:24.089
[Humbert's poem]:
"Fraulein von Kulp may turn her

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.660
hand upon the door.
/ I will not follow her.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.879
/ Nor Fresca.
/ Nor / that Gull." 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.267
So, this is a spoof of a poem
by T.S.

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.783
Eliot which I've given you a
piece of on your handout,

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.370
so let's look at that for a
second,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.717
Eliot's 1920 poem,
Gerontion. I'm just

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:47.971
going to read a little bit of
this so that you have the flavor

00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:51.180
of the thing that Nabokov is
burlesquing:

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.580
Here I am,
an old man in a dry month,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.759
Being read to by a boy,
waiting for rain.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.340
I was neither at the hot
gatesNor fought in the warm

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.530
rainNor knee deep in the
salt marsh, heaving a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.199
cutlass, Bitten by flies,
fought.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.280
My house is a decayed
house.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.080
And the poem goes on,
and this is the tone of a poem.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.527
It's a poem of crisis,
a poem of a kind of hollow

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:18.759
speaker, someone who emerges as,
more or less,

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.884
buried alive.
And this is supposed to reflect

00:04:21.884 --> 00:04:24.709
both personal crisis and a
historical crisis.

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:30.357
And it comes to a moment where
the possibility of rejuvenation

00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:35.263
is described as devoured by a
series of caricatures of

00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:38.482
Europeans,
and that's this second part on

00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:40.724
your handout,
the people that devour

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:43.542
rejuvenation.
So: By Hakagawa,

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:47.142
bowing among the Titians;
By Madame de Tornquist,

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:49.850
in the dark roomShifting
the candles;

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.281
Fräulein von Kulp--[There
she is--]Who turned in the

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.463
hall, one hand on the door.
Vacant shuttlesWeave the

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.889
wind.
I have no ghosts,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.434
An old man in a draughty
houseUnder a windy

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:06.501
knob.
What in Eliot is crisis,

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.780
in Nabokov is just a joke.
In other words,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.441
these terrifying figures in
Eliot--Fraulein von Kulp--are

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.045
just some of Humbert's nymphets.
A fraulein is just a young

00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:19.717
woman;
Fresca, another Eliot

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:23.230
character: the fresh woman,
right, a young woman again.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.089
So, I called this a burlesque
of Eliot's modernism.

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.729
It takes something meant to be
really serious,

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.480
and turns it in to a dirty
joke.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.132
And that's the first way
Nabokov will relate to literary

00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:38.651
modernism.
That's quite interesting,

00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.858
that he takes this approach,
because Eliot in some ways

00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:45.361
comes very close to the kind of
ideas about art that Nabokov

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.682
himself holds.
Eliot says poems should be

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.358
autotelic.
That means they should be an

00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:54.228
end unto themselves.
Nabokov will say in that

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:57.931
afterword you're going to read,
"the novel has as its only

00:05:57.931 --> 00:06:00.399
purpose to afford aesthetic
bliss."

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:03.509
So, the parody is of something
very close to home.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.990
And this poem that I've given
you will come back on page 134.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.560
You don't have to turn to that
now, but you should think about

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.022
that return.
It's much more serious and

00:06:15.022 --> 00:06:16.680
strange.
Okay.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.946
So that's enough on Eliot.
Now I want to really

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.449
clarify for you what I mean by
this term "modernism."

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.511
It just means the art and
literature of the early

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.509
twentieth century,
especially the "high art,"

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.779
although its roots are
definitely in the nineteenth

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.140
century, especially the French
nineteenth century,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.247
fiction and poetry.
In English it begins with the

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:43.142
late novels of Henry James
around 1900, in poetry with

00:06:43.142 --> 00:06:48.610
Eliot and with Ezra Pound.
In prose its main exemplars in

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.889
English would be James Joyce,
Virginia Woolf.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.335
And you should know about this
movement that it had very rapid

00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:58.513
success.
So, although its first centers

00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:01.255
are London and Paris,
it's already taught as classic

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:04.160
literature in American
universities before the war;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.041
it's already classic.
So, now,

00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.183
here's just a list for you:
eight features of literary

00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:12.970
modernism that are all important
to Nabokov.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.260
Eight features of literary
modernism: An obsession with the

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.666
idea of art's autonomy,
the idea that art is its own

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:23.945
law, that it responds to no
other laws, that it has no other

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.782
purpose than its own purposes.
In other words,

00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:30.319
art for art's sake.
That's Eliot's autotelic poem.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.687
The only purpose of the work of
art is to afford aesthetic

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.133
bliss.
Second, a sense of crisis,

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:41.154
a radical break in culture,
an overturning of conventional

00:07:41.154 --> 00:07:45.456
artistic forms that goes with a
sense that civilization itself

00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:49.171
is being overturned.
Third, the idea that the

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:52.829
paradigm of experience is
artistic experience,

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:57.218
that the norms for everyone
should be artistic norms of

00:07:57.218 --> 00:08:00.356
careful perception,
deep reflection,

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:03.840
that the idea that culture
itself is the saving,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.769
most important activity that
people can engage in.

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.632
Fourth--and this goes along
with that--a rejection of

00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:13.000
convention, especially sexual
convention,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.128
sexual morality,
and that's the obvious

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:17.705
connection to this book,
the very deep roots of

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:19.813
modernism.
However, at the same time

00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:22.829
there's an idea that the artist
is a kind of technician,

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:26.871
someone whose values are craft,
form and style rather than

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:30.629
message, personal expression or
wisdom of any kind.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:34.498
Sixth, this is a term from the
critic Joseph Frank:

00:08:34.498 --> 00:08:37.593
spatial form,
the idea that in place of a

00:08:37.593 --> 00:08:42.004
linear narrative you have a
system of cross-references and

00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:46.259
repeated motifs that give the
structure of works.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:50.400
In place that is only visible,
in other words on rereading,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.259
only visible on rereading.
And then,

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:56.170
this anticipates my last
points: Modernism is

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.362
self-consciously international.
In other words,

00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:02.692
it will look to international
tradition and has as its

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:06.149
ambition to be a culture not
just for one nation but for

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.707
many, maybe for all.
It goes along with this eighth

00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:13.881
characteristic that's important:
the artist is seen as a kind of

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:16.782
spiritual exile,
someone who is alienated from a

00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:19.960
home society and a home culture,
whether or not he or she has

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.419
actually left it,
as Nabokov did.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:26.690
So this is what I mean by
International High Modernism.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.743
You should add to this list of
writers especially Faulkner and

00:09:30.743 --> 00:09:34.531
Hemingway, and you should
remember that there's a parallel

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.809
American tradition,
the realist tradition that we

00:09:37.809 --> 00:09:41.370
saw Richard Wright referring to:
that is Theodore Dreiser,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.660
Sinclair Lewis,
and then going back to the

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.230
nineteenth century,
writers like Mark Twain.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.292
I had a teacher who used to
compare Lolita to Huck

00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:52.424
Finn.
They are two novels about

00:09:52.424 --> 00:09:55.450
traveling across America and an
unconventional couple.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.450
Right?
So, anyway.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.228
Okay.
But now, that modernist

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.674
tradition is something that
Nabokov owes a lot to,

00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:08.370
but he always tries to
distinguish himself from it.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.206
For Nabokov,
the highest value is

00:10:10.206 --> 00:10:12.629
originality.
He says this in his last

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:14.790
Russian novel,
The Gift.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.042
Or, he doesn't say it;
his autobiographical hero says

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:21.936
it: "Any genuinely new trend in
art is a knight's move,

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:25.252
a change of shadows,
a shift that displaces the

00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:26.534
mirror."
Okay.

00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:29.570
Any genuinely new trend is a
knight's move.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.777
I just remind you,
in chess the knight doesn't

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:36.238
move in a straight line.
It starts out in a straight

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:38.679
line and then it hops off on a
diagonal.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:42.028
Unlike any other piece,
it skips over pieces in the

00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:43.221
way.
So the knight,

00:10:43.221 --> 00:10:46.159
far from going on a straight
course, surprises you.

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:49.293
You might think of walking in
here expecting Professor

00:10:49.293 --> 00:10:52.250
Hungerford on censorship and
getting me instead.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.932
But this is a very important
idea for Nabokov both as a way

00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:59.169
of treating predecessors and as
a way of writing.

00:10:59.169 --> 00:11:03.431
And I want to show you that way
of writing very early in the

00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:06.060
book on page 10 now.
Let's take a look at that.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.838
This is at the top of the page: 
My very photogenic mother

00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:22.825
died in a freak accident
(picnic, lightning) when I was

00:11:22.825 --> 00:11:24.714
three,
and, save for a pocket of

00:11:24.714 --> 00:11:27.505
warmth in the darkest past,
nothing of her subsists within

00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:30.830
the hollows and dells of memory,
over which, if you can still

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.649
stand my style (I am writing
under observation),

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:36.195
the sun of my infancy had set:

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:38.590
Okay.
So this is a knight's move:

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.740
from traumatic event of the
mother's death--should be the

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.142
center of the sentence;
it's just dismissed--hopped

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:48.490
beyond into this stylistic wash,
a golden haze.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.220
And he goes on to describe the
sensations of early childhood.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.021
So, the strategy of the
knight's move is to frustrate

00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:59.311
your expectations,
to leap over the apparently

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:03.844
important events into something
else characterized by a kind of

00:12:03.844 --> 00:12:06.671
aesthetic play,
and these parentheses are a

00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:09.470
real icon of that.
A critic has counted 450 sets

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.946
of them in this novel,
the parentheses,

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:14.879
an important example of the
knight's move.

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:17.757
And I want to show you
another kind of knight's move,

00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:20.582
and to do that I'm going to
talk just for a moment about

00:12:20.582 --> 00:12:22.792
Nabokov's relationship to the
French writer,

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:25.348
Proust.
Proust is the great

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:30.814
aestheticist of modernism,
the novelist who writes about

00:12:30.814 --> 00:12:33.268
art,
who holds up art as a value,

00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:36.973
as well as giving a theory of
memory--memories are important

00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:39.614
in Lolita;
that really comes from

00:12:39.614 --> 00:12:43.578
Proust--a theory of memory that
has a lot to do with the work of

00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:46.489
the artist.
Nabokov, in 1966 he said this:

00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:50.480
"The greatest masterpieces of
twentieth-century prose"--this

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.959
is convenient;
take this down--"are,

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.302
in this order:
Joyce's Ulysses,

00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:57.772
Kafka's
Transformation"--that is,

00:12:57.772 --> 00:12:59.798
The
Metamorphosis--"Bely's

00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:01.761
St.
Petersburg," a pretty

00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:05.307
obscure Russian avant-garde
novel, "and the first half of

00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:09.283
Proust's fairy tale,
In Search of Lost Time."

00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:13.052
I'm not sure the fairy tale
should remind you of that first

00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:16.560
meeting between Humbert and
Lolita that we looked at on

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.419
Monday,
described in fairy tale terms.

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:21.715
But actually,
the thing I want to think about

00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:23.750
is a crude pun there,
a "fairy" tale.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.605
Proust is himself gay.
One of his big subjects is

00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:31.422
homosexuality,
and Nabokov's reaction to this

00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:34.622
is really homophobic.
This is not just about

00:13:34.622 --> 00:13:39.202
Nabokov's personal prejudice.
It's about a relationship to

00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:42.669
predecessors who are seen as too
similar.

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:45.597
The danger for
Nabokov--remember that his value

00:13:45.597 --> 00:13:48.992
is originality--the danger is
that he will fall too in love

00:13:48.992 --> 00:13:52.697
with something too like himself.
He has to hold off this

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:55.962
possibility of being too
attracted to these male

00:13:55.962 --> 00:13:58.950
predecessors who are too similar
to him.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.675
This should cue you to think
about the theme of doubling in

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:06.465
this novel, to think about the
possibility of desire between

00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:08.693
men here,
to think about the word

00:14:08.693 --> 00:14:12.085
"queer," the treatment of Gaston
Godin, that funny French

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:15.293
character in Beardsley,
to think about Humbert's

00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:19.240
constant protestations that he's
attractive to all women,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:25.010
about his supposed virility.
And it should just make you

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:32.624
wonder whether pedophilia is in
itself a kind of knight's move

00:14:32.624 --> 00:14:36.320
from homosexuality.
In other words,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.740
is there another form of
perverted desire hiding behind

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.579
the one that's in front of us?
Just a suggestion:

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:51.605
look on page 20,
still in Humbert's early life,

00:14:51.605 --> 00:14:56.365
near the bottom:
It happened for instance

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:59.662
that from my balcony I would
notice a lighted window across

00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:02.731
the street and what looked like
a nymphet in the act of

00:15:02.731 --> 00:15:05.289
undressing before a co-operative
mirror.

00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:07.010
Thus isolated,
thus removed,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.388
the vision acquired an
especially keen charm that made

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:14.340
me race with all speed toward my
lone gratification.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.077
So, we have a kind of image
there of the autonomous

00:15:17.077 --> 00:15:18.610
aesthetic pleasure,
right,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.105
the pleasure of imagination
that's taken alone,

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:24.470
according to one's own thoughts
rather than in some broader,

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.417
more social form.
But abruptly,

00:15:27.417 --> 00:15:31.519
fiendishly, the tender pattern
of nudity I had adored would be

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:35.553
transformed into the disgusting
lamp-lit bare arm of a man in

00:15:35.553 --> 00:15:39.520
his underclothes reading his
paper by the open window in the

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.668
hot,
damp, hopeless summer

00:15:42.668 --> 00:15:46.100
night.
So, the object of this

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.629
wonderful aesthetic reverie,
the nymphet,

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:54.668
turns out to be an adult male.
And I just want you to ask

00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:58.834
yourself why that could be.
But, Nabokov's relationship

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:02.160
to this modernist past is not
just the burlesque that he

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.315
visits on Eliot,
is not just this complicated

00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:08.610
attraction and
dis-identification that he works

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.197
on with Proust.
An element of admiration is

00:16:12.197 --> 00:16:15.772
also present,
and that's really part of his

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:20.270
relationship to Joyce.
Remember that he names Joyce as

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.940
the greatest master of
twentieth-century prose.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.115
I'm just going to name for you
four features of Joyce's style

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:31.664
that are important to Nabokov:
stylistic virtuosity,

00:16:31.664 --> 00:16:34.240
the ability to imitate any
style;

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.247
at the same time,
a scrupulous attention to the

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:40.320
banality of everyday life and
all its detail;

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.064
yet, the third characteristic,
the constant use of a

00:16:45.064 --> 00:16:48.664
superimposed structure.
So, in Ulysses,

00:16:48.664 --> 00:16:51.850
famously, Joyce puts the
narrative of the Odyssey

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.495
on top of a day in Dublin,
or in Joyce's earlier novel,

00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:59.355
A Portrait of the Artist as
a Young Man, a linear

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:03.356
narrative in which a young boy
grows up is structured as a

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.866
series of structurally
paralleled chapters in which

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:10.726
moments in each one correspond
to the ones in successive

00:17:10.726 --> 00:17:14.517
chapters.
And this comes with a kind of

00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:19.049
suggestion that that banal
reality is redeemed by the

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:23.180
artist's activity.
Fourthly, Joyce loves puns.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.894
So does Nabokov.
This is incredibly important,

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:29.223
and there's a direct glance at
that just ahead of where you

00:17:29.223 --> 00:17:32.911
read, so don't turn here.
I don't want to spoil what's

00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:37.670
coming up, but on page 221 there
is a reference to--don't look,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:43.143
don't look--to a writer named
Vivian Darkbloom plagiarizing

00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:45.737
from Joyce;
Vivian Darkbloom you remember

00:17:45.737 --> 00:17:48.395
from Monday.
That's the anagram of Vladimir

00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:51.259
Nabokov, so it's an explicit
recognition.

00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:54.064
And the thing that's being
plagiarized, I've actually given

00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:56.641
you on the handout.
It's a little piece of

00:17:56.641 --> 00:18:00.331
Finnegans Wake,
which is Joyce's work in which

00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:04.645
almost every word is a pun.
I'll just read you a sentence

00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:08.941
of this so you know what it's
like: "Say them all but tell

00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:11.730
them apart, cadenzando
coloratura!

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.333
R is Rubretta and A is Arancia,
Y is for Yilla and N for

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:17.856
greeneriN.
B is Boyblue with odalisque O

00:18:17.856 --> 00:18:20.730
while W waters the fleurettes of
no-vembrance."

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.180
And that spells out "rainbow."
Right.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.619
The important thing here is
that Nabokov acknowledges this

00:18:27.619 --> 00:18:31.549
debt to Joyce as not just a
parody, but a real debt.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:35.893
And so now I want to think at
more length about another Joyce

00:18:35.893 --> 00:18:39.875
allusion which shows how
complicated the relationship to

00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:42.841
his predecessor is.
And, with Eliot,

00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:45.849
I read the Nabokovian version
first.

00:18:45.849 --> 00:18:47.740
This time I'll give you the
Joyce first.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.780
So this is on your handout as
well from Chapter 2.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.099
This describes the hero,
Stephen Dedalus,

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:06.710
as a young boy trying to write
a poem.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.990
And eventually in the novel he
will succeed in writing a poem,

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.799
but here he doesn't manage to.
And so, this is a kind of

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:19.980
forecast of what will happen
later on.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.730
The further complication is
that here he's writing a poem

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.609
and then he remembers an earlier
attempt;

00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:30.537
that layering of memory,
and that kind of layering,

00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:35.329
is actually a prototype for the
layering in Lolita:

00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:42.600
The next day he sat at
his table in the bare upper room

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.988
for many hours.
Before him lay a new pen,

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:51.460
a new bottle of ink and a new
emerald exercise.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.536
[Skip a little.]
On the first line of the page

00:19:53.536 --> 00:19:56.075
appeared the title of the verses
he was trying to write:

00:19:56.075 --> 00:19:58.370
"To E-- C--."
He knew it was right to begin

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.390
so for he had seen similar
titles in the collected poems of

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.413
Lord Byron.
When he had written this title

00:20:03.413 --> 00:20:05.741
and drawn an ornamental line
underneath, he fell into a

00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:08.068
daydream and began to draw
diagrams on the cover of the

00:20:08.068 --> 00:20:10.153
book.
He saw himself sitting at his

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:13.687
table in Bray the morning after
the discussion at the Christmas

00:20:13.687 --> 00:20:16.253
dinner table,
trying to write a poem about

00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:19.500
Parnell on the back of one of
his father's second moiety

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.976
notices.
But his brain had then refused

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:25.567
to grapple with the theme and,
desisting, he had covered the

00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:28.610
page with the names and
addresses of certain of his

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.152
classmates: Roderick Kickham,
John Lawton,

00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:37.059
Anthony MacSweeney,
Simon Moonan.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:41.180
The version of this that comes
up in the novel is in the midst

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.882
of Humbert's diary,
and the diary itself,

00:20:43.882 --> 00:20:46.450
I should say,
owes a lot to Joyce.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.098
And I've given you a piece of
that diary to look at on your

00:20:50.098 --> 00:20:53.001
own on the handout.
But this is the moment that

00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:55.989
directly alludes to
Portrait, and it's

00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:58.801
really very important for
understanding Nabokov's

00:20:58.801 --> 00:21:00.934
technique.
So, page 51,

00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:03.965
near the bottom:
Thursday:

00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:10.028
We are paying with hail and
gale for the tropical beginning

00:21:10.028 --> 00:21:13.292
of the month.
In a volume of the Young

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:16.312
People's Encyclopedia I
found a map of the States that a

00:21:16.312 --> 00:21:18.922
child's pencil had started
copying out on a sheet of

00:21:18.922 --> 00:21:21.708
lightweight paper,
upon the other side of which,

00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:24.980
counter to the unfinished
outline of Florida and the Gulf,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.795
there was a mimeographed list
of names referring,

00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:30.670
evidently, to her class at the
Ramsdale School.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.727
And I think of that front
and back of the page as another

00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:36.081
kind of knight's move.
You think you're looking at one

00:21:36.081 --> 00:21:38.870
thing, and you land on another.
It is a poem I know

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.786
already by heart: Angel,
Grace Austin,

00:21:41.786 --> 00:21:43.601
Floyd Beal,
JackBeal,

00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.740
MaryBuck,
Danielâ€¦

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.007
[and so on;
I'll come back to this list,

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:50.937
actually;
just skip to the bottom on page

00:21:50.937 --> 00:21:53.094
52]
Talbot, EdgarTalbot,

00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:56.769
EdwinWayne,
Lull,--[a lull in the book,

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:58.013
right?]
Williams,

00:21:58.013 --> 00:22:00.436
Ralph Windmuller,
Louise A poem,

00:22:00.436 --> 00:22:03.671
a poem forsooth!
So strange and sweet was it to

00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:07.323
discover this Haze Dolores:
she, in its special bower of

00:22:07.323 --> 00:22:09.779
names with its bodyguard of
roses,

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:14.110
a fairy princess between her
two maids of honor.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.891
That's the fairy tale again.
In a way this is just like the

00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:22.061
Joyce.
A list of names leads up to

00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:26.630
this aesthetic sensation,
the revelation of a poem.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.697
The ordinary materials of life
become the basis for a kind of

00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:35.461
artistic achievement.
However, obviously this is not

00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:37.950
like the Joyce,
where there is a realistic

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.470
depiction of a young boy trying
to write, getting bored and

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.901
failing.
Here something else is

00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:47.930
happening, because the list of
names is not ordinary.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.119
Right.
There is that bower of roses.

00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:53.290
That refers to Mary Rose
Hamilton;

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.369
Haze, Dolores;
Hanek, Rosaline.

00:22:56.369 --> 00:23:02.105
And then there's Emile Rosado
and Carmine Rose--a red

00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:07.400
rose--Angel, Grace--
really!--Stella Fantasia.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.672
And then even the ordinary
names are kind of plants,

00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:14.393
because almost every name on
this list comes back elsewhere

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.518
in the book.
You could look,

00:23:16.518 --> 00:23:19.667
for example,
for Louise Windmuller or Vivian

00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.069
McCrystal.
And then, right in the middle

00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:23.920
(oh, and then we have
Shakespeare too:

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.452
Miranda Anthony,
Miranda Viola) and right in the

00:23:27.452 --> 00:23:31.200
middle you have a kind of
explanation planted:

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.390
McCoo,
Virginia;

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.450
McCrystal, Vivian;
McFate Aubrey.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:42.719
McFate, which as you know
is something Humbert gets kind

00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:46.048
of obsessed with,
is the icon of the difference

00:23:46.048 --> 00:23:49.739
between the realistic world of
Joyce and the already

00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:53.105
artificial,
already aestheticized world of

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:55.562
this novel.
No one was ever really named

00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:59.588
McFate.
McFate is a kind of parody of

00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:03.502
real randomness.
You might think of it as having

00:24:03.502 --> 00:24:06.793
the same relation to real fate
as Chicken McNuggets do to

00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:08.773
chicken.
In other words,

00:24:08.773 --> 00:24:12.772
you might think of it as a kind
of artificial,

00:24:12.772 --> 00:24:16.771
processed, bland,
easily consumable version of

00:24:16.771 --> 00:24:18.829
fate.
I really mean that.

00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:22.096
One of the funny things about
that debt to Finnegans Wake

00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:25.640
is, Finnegans Wake as
a book of puns is unreadable.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.310
Nobody reads it except
specialists like me.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.420
Lolita was a bestseller.
Nabokov made so much money from

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.369
it he was able to retire to
Switzerland.

00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:38.699
And you should ask yourself
what about this novel makes that

00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:40.058
possible;
why is that,

00:24:40.058 --> 00:24:43.750
that you have this McNugget
version of the modernist novel?

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.009
And I don't really mean that to
disparage the novel,

00:24:47.009 --> 00:24:50.653
but it makes it clear that
there's some kind of difference

00:24:50.653 --> 00:24:54.680
between this and the works that
Nabokov is looking back to.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.355
I want to think a little bit
more about this idea of a

00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:02.756
McFate.
There is a kind of short

00:25:02.756 --> 00:25:08.247
circuit between the Joycean idea
of taking ordinary life and

00:25:08.247 --> 00:25:12.250
transforming it into an
aesthetic order,

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:16.119
because the ordinary is already
aesthetic in the book.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:18.859
In other words,
chance is already fated.

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:21.528
The thing that stands for
randomness in this book,

00:25:21.528 --> 00:25:23.761
the thing that looks like
ordinary detail,

00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:27.029
has already been arranged to
give you artistic pleasure.

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:31.142
That's why Humbert can be
instantly delighted in the list

00:25:31.142 --> 00:25:33.960
of names.
This doesn't look forward to

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.821
Humbert's poem;
it already is a poem and it is

00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:42.069
a poem to the crazed,
aroused mind of Humbert.

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:45.988
So, the artificial has taken
the place of the real here,

00:25:45.988 --> 00:25:50.049
and this novel really reminds
you of that all the time.

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:54.424
On 84, Humbert's thinking of
killing Charlotte,

00:25:54.424 --> 00:25:58.133
and he says,
"No man can bring about the

00:25:58.133 --> 00:26:02.430
perfect murder.
Chance, however, can do it."

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.823
Chance can do it,
and of course the perfect

00:26:04.823 --> 00:26:08.197
murder does happen.
Charlotte Haze dies as if by a

00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:11.028
total accident,
but we're aware that the

00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:14.440
accident is so perfect that it
was arranged.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.048
So, this is the,
kind of, hand of Nabokov,

00:26:17.048 --> 00:26:20.421
taking a narrative of real
events and twisting it into

00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:23.029
something that makes a kind of
sense,

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:26.319
taking fate and making it
McFate.

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:29.582
And I want to show you one
more example of that,

00:26:29.582 --> 00:26:33.420
in the scene where Humbert and
Lolita have reached the hotel,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:41.965
the Enchanted Hunter.
This is on page 118 near the

00:26:41.965 --> 00:26:45.111
bottom.
"In the slow,

00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:47.970
clear hand of crime,
I wrote 'Dr.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.561
Edgar H.
Humbert and daughter,

00:26:50.561 --> 00:26:53.420
342 Lawn Street,
Ramsdale.'

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:59.211
A key, 342, was half shown to
me, magician showing object he

00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:04.119
is about to palm and hand it
over to Uncle Tom."

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:06.235
The coincidence--normally,
in real life,

00:27:06.235 --> 00:27:09.055
it would be a delightful
coincidence to go to a hotel

00:27:09.055 --> 00:27:12.527
room that has the same number as
your street address--here it's a

00:27:12.527 --> 00:27:15.781
kind of too-easy icon of the
correspondence between the place

00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:19.470
where Humbert meets Lolita and
the place where he rapes her.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.213
And the book just tells you
that, right, in one of those

00:27:22.213 --> 00:27:25.006
parentheses--"the magician
showing the object he is about

00:27:25.006 --> 00:27:27.950
to palm"-- the ordinary event
which is really trickery,

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.018
a suggestion that nothing has
been left to chance in the

00:27:32.018 --> 00:27:37.069
novel;
nothing is ordinary.

00:27:37.069 --> 00:27:40.994
Now, as I come to my last
section here,

00:27:40.994 --> 00:27:46.601
what I want to suggest is that
this kind of transformation of

00:27:46.601 --> 00:27:49.522
arbitrary,
real fated events into

00:27:49.522 --> 00:27:53.774
conspicuously artificial tricks
(which you might think of a

00:27:53.774 --> 00:27:56.339
knight's move on the real:
fate;

00:27:56.339 --> 00:28:01.954
McFate) is a response in
particular to exile,

00:28:01.954 --> 00:28:08.079
in particular to Nabokov's
condition of exile.

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:13.076
An exile, living in a foreign
country, lives in a kind of

00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:15.897
denaturalized world,
a world where,

00:28:15.897 --> 00:28:19.513
instead of everything making
instant sense everything has to

00:28:19.513 --> 00:28:20.799
be decoded.
Right.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.779
Nothing is initially known to
make sense;

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:26.490
everything has to be figured
out and reinvented.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.415
In that afterword to this book,
Nabokov says he had to invent

00:28:30.415 --> 00:28:33.630
America.
That's because he didn't know

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.630
it already;
it wasn't given to him.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.359
Now, in a way this is a
terrible state,

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:43.309
a state of discontinuity with
the world you exist in.

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:47.203
But it has a payoff,
kind of, a payoff which is the

00:28:47.203 --> 00:28:51.409
possibility precisely of
inventing, and this is visible

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:55.156
everywhere in this book.
One example is the

00:28:55.156 --> 00:29:00.160
transformation of housework.
This is on page 179.

00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:13.382
"My west-door neighbor"--west
door--"who might have been a

00:29:13.382 --> 00:29:15.299
businessman or a college
teacher,

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:19.334
or both, would speak to me once
in a while as he barbered some

00:29:19.334 --> 00:29:21.980
late garden blooms or watered
his car,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.446
or, at a later date,
defrosted his driveway (I don't

00:29:25.446 --> 00:29:28.029
mind if these verbs are all
wrong)."

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:30.319
Of course, the point is that
they're all wrong.

00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:33.763
The point is that this
clichéd suburban life of

00:29:33.763 --> 00:29:36.481
mowing the lawn,
washing the car and so on has

00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:39.320
been transformed--precisely
because Humbert is a

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.279
foreigner--into something you
can laugh at,

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:45.635
something you can enjoy,
something that you can apply

00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:47.766
the knight's move to.
And this is,

00:29:47.766 --> 00:29:50.461
even a couple pages before,
explicitly described as

00:29:50.461 --> 00:29:52.509
something particular to
foreigners.

00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:55.179
Because, you remember,
Gaston Godin says about the

00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:57.250
school that Lolita's going to go
to,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.097
the girls are taught "not to
spell very well,

00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:04.015
but to smell very well."
And Humbert comments that it's

00:30:04.015 --> 00:30:07.220
"with a foreigner's love for
such things";

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.972
the foreigner's love for this
kind of move is a response to

00:30:12.972 --> 00:30:16.940
this denaturalized world of the
exile.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.746
It's important,
in this connection,

00:30:18.746 --> 00:30:21.314
to remember that the knight's
move as a way of avoiding

00:30:21.314 --> 00:30:23.295
obstacles,
in particular,

00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:26.960
keeps skipping over forms of
violence.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.019
There is that mother's death at
the beginning.

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:33.692
There is another moment in
which Humbert is tracing his

00:30:33.692 --> 00:30:37.703
hand along Lolita's leg and he
discovers a bruise there that

00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:41.250
he'd given her accidentally.
That's early on in the book.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.631
In other words,
this surprise is a violent

00:30:43.631 --> 00:30:45.938
surprise.
You can even look at the

00:30:45.938 --> 00:30:48.790
mention of a knight's move in
this book.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.060
That's page 192: 

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.306
One of the latticed
squares in a small cobwebby

00:31:00.306 --> 00:31:03.502
casement window at the turn of
the staircase was glazed with

00:31:03.502 --> 00:31:06.283
ruby,
and that raw wound among the

00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:10.542
unstained rectangles and its
asymmetrical position--a

00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:14.883
knight's move from the
top--always extremely disturbed

00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:17.331
me.
The knight's move--which is

00:31:17.331 --> 00:31:19.836
just a playful way of describing
where the window is,

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:22.631
right-- the knight's move is
nonetheless a kind of wound or

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:25.163
damage.
So, even as it's the prototype

00:31:25.163 --> 00:31:27.767
for originality,
it's also something very

00:31:27.767 --> 00:31:30.956
disturbing and harmful.
And that conjunction,

00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:34.448
I want to suggest,
that conjunction has to do with

00:31:34.448 --> 00:31:37.940
the traumatic event of having
had to emigrate,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.730
having had to take up another
language.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:46.293
Nabokov will say that his
private tragedy is that,

00:31:46.293 --> 00:31:48.579
let's see:
[His]

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:50.712
private tragedy,
which cannot,

00:31:50.712 --> 00:31:54.170
and indeed should not,
be anybody's concern,

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.914
is that I had to abandon my
natural idiom,

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:59.726
my untrammeled,
rich, and infinitely docile

00:31:59.726 --> 00:32:03.876
Russian tongue for a second-rate
brand of English devoid of any

00:32:03.876 --> 00:32:07.089
of those apparatuses--the
baffling mirror,

00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:10.897
the black velvet backdrop,
the implied associations and

00:32:10.897 --> 00:32:13.930
traditions--which the native
illusionist,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.391
the frac-tails flying,
can magically use to transcend

00:32:18.391 --> 00:32:21.480
the heritage in his own
way.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.773
Here, being in exile prevents
Nabokov from making that

00:32:25.773 --> 00:32:29.297
knight's move.
And you might think about that

00:32:29.297 --> 00:32:32.193
homophobic attitude to a
Proustian past,

00:32:32.193 --> 00:32:35.980
the fear that it's too like
what he wants to do.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.546
But the main point here to
think about is that feeling of

00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:41.219
damage.
On the other hand,

00:32:41.219 --> 00:32:44.762
the critic Michael Wood has
pointed out that Nabokov didn't

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.917
lose Russian.
He didn't lose it on the way

00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:50.781
while he was riding the boat;
he decided to stop writing in

00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:52.645
it.
And Wood says this:

00:32:52.645 --> 00:32:56.924
"Nabokov could appreciate
language itself only after he

00:32:56.924 --> 00:33:01.678
had made himself lose a language
and had found another in the

00:33:01.678 --> 00:33:05.025
ashes of his loss."
A kind of economy,

00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:09.685
a balance between the loss of
one language and a particular

00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:13.299
set of techniques that comes in
its place.

00:33:13.299 --> 00:33:17.563
These techniques are really
I think the source of the most

00:33:17.563 --> 00:33:21.925
appealing writing in this book,
and so let's look now at one of

00:33:21.925 --> 00:33:25.902
those evocations of the American
landscape which I just think

00:33:25.902 --> 00:33:29.880
maybe are the closest the book
comes just to pure beauty.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.325
On page 152--oh,
and by the way,

00:33:33.325 --> 00:33:37.549
this book was written on road
trips.

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:40.306
Nabokov's wife,
Vera, drove him on thousands of

00:33:40.306 --> 00:33:43.482
miles of trips around the
country while he was writing

00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:45.819
this novel and hunting
butterflies,

00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:52.220
so think about that--but here
is 152, evocation of the

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.930
landscape:
By a paradox of pictorial

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.936
thought, the average lowland
North American countryside had

00:33:59.936 --> 00:34:03.872
at first seemed to me something
I accepted with a shock of

00:34:03.872 --> 00:34:07.119
amused recognition,
because of those painted oil

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:10.526
cloths which were imported from
America in the old days to be

00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:13.650
hung above washstands in central
European nurseries,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.083
and which fascinated a drowsy
child at bedtime with the rustic

00:34:17.083 --> 00:34:19.110
green views they depicted:
opaque,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.307
curly trees,
a barn, cattle,

00:34:21.307 --> 00:34:25.619
a brook, the dull white of
vague orchards in bloom,

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:28.031
and perhaps a stone fence,
or hills of greenish

00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:30.382
gouache.
So, so far the American

00:34:30.382 --> 00:34:34.392
landscape is already a work of
art, already part of a European

00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:36.804
memory.
Then something else happens:

00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:40.314
"But gradually the models of
those elementary rusticities

00:34:40.314 --> 00:34:43.010
became stranger and stranger to
the eye,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.205
the nearer I came to know them.
Beyond the tilled plain"--in

00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:48.682
other words, the already
worked-over, domesticated

00:34:48.682 --> 00:34:52.767
plain--"beyond the toy roofs,
there would be a slow suffusion

00:34:52.767 --> 00:34:56.746
of inutile loveliness,
a low sun in a platinum haze

00:34:56.746 --> 00:34:59.802
with a warm,
peeled-peach tinge pervading

00:34:59.802 --> 00:35:02.129
the upper edge of a
two-dimensional,

00:35:02.129 --> 00:35:05.920
dove-gray cloud fusing with the
distant amorous mist."

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.087
"Inutile loveliness" is
kind of the key word of

00:35:09.087 --> 00:35:12.128
Nabokov's technique,
and he says the novel has as

00:35:12.128 --> 00:35:15.170
its only purpose to provide
aesthetic bliss.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.329
So, here is inutile loveliness
coming just from seeing the

00:35:18.329 --> 00:35:22.119
landscape as a stranger.
Humbert goes on: 

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:25.962
There might be a line of
spaced trees silhouetted against

00:35:25.962 --> 00:35:28.727
the horizon,
and hot, still noons above a

00:35:28.727 --> 00:35:31.845
wilderness of clover,
and Claude Lorrain clouds

00:35:31.845 --> 00:35:35.776
inscribed remotely into misty
azure with only their cumulus

00:35:35.776 --> 00:35:40.250
part conspicuous against the
neutral swoon of the background.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.675
Or again, it might be a stern
El Greco horizon,

00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:47.622
pregnant with inky rain,
and a passing glimpse of some

00:35:47.622 --> 00:35:51.282
mummy-necked farmer,
and all around alternating

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:55.099
strips of quicksilverish water
and harsh green corn,

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:59.371
the whole arrangement opening
like a fan, somewhere in

00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:02.478
Kansas.
So, a European artist actually

00:36:02.478 --> 00:36:05.010
appears again there,
with Claude Lorrain,

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.174
but kind of made strange:
given that knight's move,

00:36:08.174 --> 00:36:11.623
given a new twist.
So--instead of familiar,

00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:15.029
incorporated into this
profoundly strange,

00:36:15.029 --> 00:36:19.017
vast landscape that gets
Humbert's most appealing

00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:22.340
rhetoric--the rhetoric of an
exile.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.768
But, I don't want you to think
that this just means

00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:28.457
everything's okay.
Of course, everything is not

00:36:28.457 --> 00:36:30.159
okay.
Even Humbert will tell us so.

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:33.412
Just a few pages later,
on page 175,

00:36:33.412 --> 00:36:36.200
he talks about his journey:

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:45.519
We had been everywhere.
We had really seen nothing.

00:36:45.519 --> 00:36:50.159
And I catch myself thinking
today that our long journey had

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:54.639
only defiled with a sinuous
trail of slime the lovely,

00:36:54.639 --> 00:36:58.157
trustful, dreamy,
enormous country that by then,

00:36:58.157 --> 00:37:01.000
in retrospect,
was no more to us than a

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.832
collection of dog-eared maps,
ruined tour-books,

00:37:04.832 --> 00:37:08.541
old tires, and her sobs in the
night--every night,

00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:12.250
every night--the moment I
feigned sleep.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.568
We have to pair that with that
other evocation of the landscape

00:37:15.568 --> 00:37:19.165
to see this alternate idea,
that actually this distanced

00:37:19.165 --> 00:37:22.889
criss-crossing of the landscape
could be damaging.

00:37:22.889 --> 00:37:25.392
Think of those other violent
knight's moves,

00:37:25.392 --> 00:37:27.719
like skipping past the mother's
death.

00:37:27.719 --> 00:37:32.730
Somehow this is skipped past,
that--the sobs in the night.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.474
There's another version,
yet another version,

00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:39.030
that relates back to that funny
figure of Gaston Godin.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:45.150
And I spoke about Proust;
Gaston Godin has a picture of

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.084
Proust on his wall,
and in fact,

00:37:47.084 --> 00:37:49.893
he has pictures of all great
figures of French

00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:53.201
modernism--André
Gide, the dancer Nijinsky--all

00:37:53.201 --> 00:37:55.448
figures of this kind of
aestheticism,

00:37:55.448 --> 00:37:58.195
this belief in the power of
art, and all gay,

00:37:58.195 --> 00:38:02.672
as Godin himself is.
And Humbert has a kind of

00:38:02.672 --> 00:38:07.350
hatred for that,
which he voices on page 173.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.270
Sorry, 183: 

00:38:12.849 --> 00:38:16.016
There he was,
devoid of any talent

00:38:16.016 --> 00:38:20.400
whatsoever, a mediocre teacher,
a worthless scholar,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.071
a glum, repulsive,
fat, old invert,

00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:27.000
highly contemptuous of the
American way of life,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.570
triumphantly ignorant of the
English language.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.988
There he was,
in priggish New England--[here

00:38:31.988 --> 00:38:33.957
are we!]
crooned over by the old and

00:38:33.957 --> 00:38:37.913
caressed by the young,
oh, having a grand time and

00:38:37.913 --> 00:38:41.699
fooling everybody,
and here was I.

00:38:41.699 --> 00:38:46.318
And the contrast here is
between someone who has remained

00:38:46.318 --> 00:38:49.983
tied to that European past,
remained comfortably

00:38:49.983 --> 00:38:53.422
alienated--and by that very
means been able to fit into

00:38:53.422 --> 00:38:57.690
society--with someone who is in
a much more ambivalent position,

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.743
someone who's trying to become
an American writer,

00:39:00.743 --> 00:39:04.170
as Nabokov says he's doing:
trying to invent America,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.334
trying to bridge the gap
between Russian and English,

00:39:07.334 --> 00:39:11.230
but always finding that English
is only a kind of second best.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.888
And in fact it's more than
that: he translated Lolita

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:23.370
back in to Russian later on,
and he added a second afterword

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:27.612
where he said this:
That wondrous Russian

00:39:27.612 --> 00:39:31.550
tongue that, it seemed to me,
was waiting for me somewhere,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.860
was flowering like a faithful
springtime behind a tightly

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.288
locked gate whose key I had held
in safekeeping for so many

00:39:38.288 --> 00:39:41.260
years,
proved to be nonexistent.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.125
And there is nothing behind the
gate but charred stumps and a

00:39:45.125 --> 00:39:48.797
hopeless autumnal distance,
and the key in my hand is more

00:39:48.797 --> 00:39:53.503
like a skeleton key.
So, there's a kind of lost

00:39:53.503 --> 00:39:59.050
paradise of European culture
which he can't get back,

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:04.170
even with this spectacular
effort in English.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:13.260
So, that suggests that it's not
all to the good;

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.039
it hasn't been saved by taking
up these knight's move

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:20.309
techniques, the defamiliarizing
techniques;

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:22.329
there's still a record of
damage.

00:40:22.329 --> 00:40:25.853
And so, I'm going to end a
little early,

00:40:25.853 --> 00:40:29.050
just throwing out an analogy
for you.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:34.364
And it's an analogy that
Nabokov himself tries to debunk

00:40:34.364 --> 00:40:39.095
completely in that afterword.
So, you should be skeptical of

00:40:39.095 --> 00:40:42.740
it, but then you should also ask
yourself whether you can really

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.673
do completely without it.
Might it be that Nabokov's own

00:40:46.673 --> 00:40:50.992
relationship to American
culture, his relationship to the

00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:54.000
English language that he
transforms,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.739
is like Humbert's relationship
to Lolita;

00:40:56.739 --> 00:41:00.996
that is, might it be that it's
a kind of kidnapping of an

00:41:00.996 --> 00:41:04.871
American innocent by a
cosmopolitan European for his

00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:08.311
own ends,
ends which are seen as a kind

00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:12.025
of perversion?
That's that element of violence

00:41:12.025 --> 00:41:16.206
that keeps coming back,
the trail of slime across this

00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:20.407
dream of transforming reality,
in this Joycean way,

00:41:20.407 --> 00:41:24.163
into something saved,
the dream of turning fate,

00:41:24.163 --> 00:41:28.004
the fate of a dead mother--or,
in Nabokov's own case,

00:41:28.004 --> 00:41:29.756
a father killed by
assassination,

00:41:29.756 --> 00:41:32.659
a brother killed in a
concentration camp--turning that

00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:34.739
into this beautifully worked
out,

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:37.844
playful system,
defined by puns,

00:41:37.844 --> 00:41:41.650
and images, and a spell of
rhetoric.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.204
In other words,
could it be that all of this

00:41:45.204 --> 00:41:50.328
modernist technique that Humbert
succeeds in putting to his own

00:41:50.328 --> 00:41:55.370
ends--that Nabokov succeeds in
putting to his own ends--is not

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.588
an unambiguous good,
but a record of a kind of

00:42:00.588 --> 00:42:03.828
damage?
Now, on Monday you're going

00:42:03.828 --> 00:42:08.054
to hear about this novel's
confrontation with the idea that

00:42:08.054 --> 00:42:12.014
art could be saving,
that it could somehow be

00:42:12.014 --> 00:42:17.917
redemptive, but here I think is
a hint that it's something that

00:42:17.917 --> 00:42:21.630
the novel simply laughs at
hollowly.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.059
And you might think of one last
example.

00:42:24.059 --> 00:42:28.075
all these things I've been
saying about the delight in

00:42:28.075 --> 00:42:31.940
words is put in the mouth of
that horrible woman,

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.436
the headmistress of the
Beardsley School,

00:42:34.436 --> 00:42:36.060
Miss Pratt, on page 197.

00:42:42.619 --> 00:42:45.778
Miss Pratt says to Humbert,
"I'm always fascinated by the

00:42:45.778 --> 00:42:48.486
admirable way foreigners,
or at least naturalized

00:42:48.486 --> 00:42:50.630
Americans, use our rich
language."

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:54.731
In other words,
that the aesthetic discovery of

00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:59.991
English is something that just
kind of fits comfortably into

00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:04.360
this prejudice of the dull
suburban American.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.403
So, I'll just end there with
this thought,

00:43:07.403 --> 00:43:11.856
this doubt, about Nabokov's own
use of modernist technique in

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:14.544
this novel,
about the emphasis on the

00:43:14.544 --> 00:43:17.315
aesthetic here:
whether it could be--not just

00:43:17.315 --> 00:43:21.283
that triumph of the imagination
that Humbert sees in the list of

00:43:21.283 --> 00:43:25.000
the names--but a mark of a wound
that can't be healed.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.107
Prof: Well,
last time we saved theory from

00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:09.890
the clutches of Knapp and
Michaels,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.370
and we did so by saying that
there really is a difference

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.770
between language and speech.
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.713
That's a claim that I want to
continue investigating in

00:00:21.713 --> 00:00:28.360
today's concluding lecture,
but in the meantime when I say

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.772
we saved theory,
you may well be asking by this

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:35.340
time,
"Well, okay,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.650
so you saved it,
but for what?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.250
Why?"
 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.910
We began to suggest last time
that in a certain sense,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.823
especially in view of
neo-pragmatists' claims about

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:52.460
the agency of language and
speech--

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.690
understood to be one and the
same thing--

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.822
in view of claims of this kind,
do we have to conclude that

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.359
theory is impractical?
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.456
That is, that it can't have
anything to do with pragmatist

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:09.620
objectives?
 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.732
That, too, is something I want
to worry a little bit about

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:14.310
today.
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.510
Why do we bother to save
literary theory?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.560
Well, it has something to do
plainly with communication.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.072
Speech, as we said last time,
is unquestionably for--that is

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:35.930
to say we have made it
for--communication.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.361
So the old, frankly incredibly
tired question,

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.489
"How well do we
communicate with each

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:43.709
other?"
 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.486
is unfortunately,
in a way, not irrelevant to

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:50.489
what we're trying to get at
here.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.516
I want to say a couple of
things about what the French

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:56.772
during the existentialist period
called la manque de la

00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:58.030
communication.
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.530
In a way, they're not really
connected.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.766
First of all,
I want to say that we actually

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.120
communicate rather well.
 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.840
Congratulations to us,
in other words!

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.157
I think that many of the
conventional ways in which

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:19.908
people worry about whether or
not we can understand each

00:02:19.908 --> 00:02:23.037
other--
many of those ways of thinking

00:02:23.037 --> 00:02:26.229
about the problem are actually
exaggerated.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.491
My own feeling is that perhaps
a good deal of the time we

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.220
understand each other all too
well, and &gt;

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.361
that it might be better,
in a way, if we didn't have

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.829
quite such an acute sense of
where each of us are coming

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.560
from.
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.910
It probably would improve human
relations rather than otherwise,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.589
and this may have something to
do with what I take to be a

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.592
certain measure of bad faith in
the ways in which we try to get

00:02:57.592 --> 00:03:00.818
together and raise each other's
consciousness.

00:03:00.818 --> 00:03:03.812
Our supposition is that the
whole problem is that we don't

00:03:03.812 --> 00:03:06.747
communicate well enough,
and we don't understand each

00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:08.860
other's subject positions well
enough.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.764
As I say, I'm not completely
convinced of that,

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:15.046
so there's a certain sense in
which I say, "Hey,

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.310
speech is great.
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.550
It's doing just fine.
 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.258
Don't worry.
 

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:23.538
We're communicating perfectly
well, possibly too well."

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:26.997
So why on earth should theory
come along and say,

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:29.950
"Well, there's sort of a
problem with

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.680
communication"?
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.348
The problem is this nagging
entity called language

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:43.318
which keeps poking up through
the communication process,

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:46.479
getting in its way,
impeding communication,

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.979
as the Russian formalists
suggested--

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.410
all for the better,
as they saw it--

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.780
that language does.
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.210
Why should it matter?
 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.479
What's at stake?
 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.021
As Knapp and Michaels might
say, what's at stake in calling

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.860
attention to the way in which
language does impede

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.270
communication?
 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.352
In other words,
we communicate fine,

00:04:09.352 --> 00:04:11.792
but what we really mean in
saying that is,

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.530
we communicate fine for
everyday purposes.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.370
Speech has a rough and ready
efficacy,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.970
and anybody who denies that,
as I say,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.572
is simply exaggerating problems
that may exist on grounds other

00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:28.170
than difficulty of
communication.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.759
So speech is really fine up to
a point.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.903
Part of the function of theory
is precisely to interrogate the

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:42.793
degree to which speech in an
unimpeded way communicates and

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:47.769
the level of accuracy and detail
at which speech can ever be

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.300
expected to communicate.
 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.916
These are the sorts of
questions that we might expect

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.569
theory to ask,
and if you say, "Well,

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.495
I'm still not very convinced
that that's an important aspect

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:04.088
of one's intellectual
life," I don't blame you.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:07.894
I hope to have convinced you
over the next forty-five minutes

00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:11.762
or so that it's pretty important
in a variety of ways and that

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:13.730
it's worth keeping in mind.
 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.190
In the meantime,
just to start on this issue

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.759
tentatively,
we can understand theory--and

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.817
of course,
we began the semester by

00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:25.608
defining it,
by trying to distinguish

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:29.490
between theory and philosophy;
theory and methodology;

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.194
perhaps even those sorts of
approaches to literature that

00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:36.240
Knapp and Michaels call
"poetics";

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.464
maybe even to distinguish
between theory and hermeneutics,

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:44.095
because after all,
the whole drive and function of

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:47.060
hermeneutics is to discover
meaning.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.343
There is a certain sense,
as we have come sadly to

00:05:50.343 --> 00:05:52.821
realize,
in which theory is more

00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:56.759
interested in the way in which
meaning is impeded,

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.399
so it may be--as we suggested,
as I say,

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.410
at the beginning of the
course--that as to theory,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.019
if we're to get comfortable
with it at all,

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:10.278
we have to keep in mind that
it's not philosophy.

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:12.307
That is to say,
even though you're good at

00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:14.630
theory and you understand the
purpose of theory,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.509
you can still be a system
builder.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.182
That is to say,
you can still have a sense of

00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:24.942
explaining the totality of
things that philosophy needs if

00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:29.283
it's going to function as
philosophy or as philosophy

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:31.120
properly should.
 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.149
You can still,
as Knapp and Michaels say,

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:38.077
engage empirically with
questions of literary data

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:42.245
summarized in such a way as to
amount to what we call

00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:44.170
"poetics."
 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.043
You can do all these things,
and you don't really have to

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:54.093
feel as though theory is somehow
or another standing on the

00:06:54.093 --> 00:06:58.968
sidelines sort of shaking its
fist at you and wagging its

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:00.100
finger.
 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.399
Theory doesn't have to be
understood as a watchdog.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.505
At least in my opinion,
and not everyone agrees with

00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:11.824
me,
theory really lets us go our

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:18.002
own way and simply reminds us
that there are certain limits or

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:22.660
reservations that need to be
kept in mind,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.310
that one is perhaps wisest to
keep in mind,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.019
as we think through problems of
interpretation and meaning.

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:34.446
So theory I would define
as--and I've used this word

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:37.050
"negation"
a lot--

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.428
I would define theory as a
negative movement of thought

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:47.009
mapping the ways in which it is
legitimate--

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:50.194
as opposed to the ways in which
I have suggested it's perhaps

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:53.072
not legitimate--
but mapping the ways in which

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:56.519
it is legitimate to be
suspicious of communication.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:02.396
Theory is an antithetical
counterforce to that which is

00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:07.259
commonly supposed to be true,
posited as true,

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.139
and--here of course one comes
to the point--

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:15.839
spoken as true:
enounced, articulated,

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:18.189
spoken as true.
 

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:23.189
So if that's the case,
why the fuss about language?

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:27.709
Why do we so quickly narrow the
issue down to language?

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:31.891
What I said last time about
language and the relationship

00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:36.523
between language and speech may
have seemed unconvincing to you

00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:38.690
because it was so narrow.
 

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.566
I want to broaden today,
considerably broaden,

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:46.960
the sense of what I mean by
"language."

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.880
It seems to me that theory
encourages a measure of

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.109
suspicion about the efficacy of
speech, that which is spoken as

00:08:58.109 --> 00:09:00.519
true, in three ways.
 

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:05.690
Last time I mentioned one,
but now let me emphasize three.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.956
The first and the one I did
mention last time is the way in

00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:14.769
which language obtrudes itself
as sound.

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:18.460
In other words,
if we think of the efficiency

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.408
or functionality of speech as a
medium of communication,

00:09:23.408 --> 00:09:27.570
we're forced to ask ourselves,
even as we engage in speech,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.921
how and why it is that speech
is so much burdened in ways that

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.559
are of no use whatsoever to us
for the most part.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:36.950
Sometimes they are of use.
 

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.264
One of the pre-freshmen asked
me last time,

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:44.918
"Well, isn't sound a
reinforcement of meaning?"

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.340
I told you when we did the New
Criticism that all of you had

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.658
done the New Criticism in high
school.

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:53.720
That's the way you learned
literary interpretation.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.904
Well, this was a perfect
embodiment of a bright person

00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:59.070
coming out of high school
saying,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.745
"Interpretation just
is the New Criticism and

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:05.830
I've been taught that sound
reinforces sense.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.950
That's what it says in
Perrine's handbook about

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.509
understanding poetry.
 

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.178
Sound reinforces sense."
 

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:16.585
Well, it often does,
of course, and on those

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:21.099
occasions we can revel in the
complexity of an intentional

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:26.087
meaning or intentional structure
that is augmented by the way in

00:10:26.087 --> 00:10:28.940
which sound patterns are used.
 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.741
At the same time,
as the Russian formalists

00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:36.004
discovered,
working through materials that

00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:39.331
weren't perhaps so much
materials like John Donne's

00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:43.188
"The Canonization"
or texts of the kind that lent

00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:45.234
themselves,
to a degree,

00:10:45.234 --> 00:10:50.730
readily to the New Criticism;
but rather alliterative verse,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.190
folklore and folk verse in the
Russian tradition,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.131
verse embodying proverbs--what
they noticed in studying these

00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:07.380
materials is that there is
simply no way of grasping a

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.595
semantic purpose,
a purpose having to do with

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:15.057
meaning,
in the sound elements that are

00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:15.960
involved.
 

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:22.202
I think that as we recognize
the way in which there is a

00:11:22.202 --> 00:11:29.240
strange pull in our spontaneous
speaking toward repetitiousness

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.530
of sound,
it's not just that we

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.509
all speak iambic pentameter
without knowing it--

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:37.850
which, by the way,
is by and large and true.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.158
It's not just that.
 

00:11:39.158 --> 00:11:42.923
It's that there is an
extraordinary amount of

00:11:42.923 --> 00:11:47.798
alliteration and rhythmic
determination in what we say.

00:11:47.798 --> 00:11:51.668
Jakobson has an interesting
point in "Linguistics and

00:11:51.668 --> 00:11:54.451
Poetics"
about that moment when we're

00:11:54.451 --> 00:11:58.658
nearby and an accident takes
place or something like that.

00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:01.423
He says in effect,
"You could call a person

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:03.600
in a situation like that
anything,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.918
but we call that person an
innocent bystander,

00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:10.720
and the reason we do so is
metric."

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.971
A person is an innocent
bystander not because that

00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:17.886
expression has any particular
meaning or semantic valence as

00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:21.870
over against other expressions
but because it's catchy,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.899
because it sort of sticks in
our mind,

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.899
perhaps for mnemotechnical
reasons,

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:34.668
as catchy.
 

00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:38.644
Eisenhower won the election
against Stevenson because

00:12:38.644 --> 00:12:42.697
"I like Ike"
is a more efficient sort of way

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:47.283
of engaging with the repetition
of sound than "Madly for

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:48.658
Adlai."
 

00:12:48.658 --> 00:12:51.807
Jakobson doesn't go into that,
but I think an interesting

00:12:51.807 --> 00:12:54.000
political analysis could be made
of,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.779
as I say, the greater efficacy
of "I like Ike."

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:02.886
All of these functions of sound
or, I should say,

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:09.484
appearances of sound in speech
are what an economist might call

00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:11.080
irrational.
 

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.695
They're there,
they're doing a job,

00:13:13.695 --> 00:13:17.924
but it's not really a job of
anything that we could call

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:19.308
communication.
 

00:13:19.308 --> 00:13:25.893
The job they're doing is sort
of free spirited on the part of

00:13:25.893 --> 00:13:27.100
language.
 

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.140
It's just there in an arbitrary
relation with the semantic

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.908
pattern of speech.
 

00:13:33.908 --> 00:13:37.690
So much then for sound,
but it's not only that.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.634
If it were only that,
if literary theory were only

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:45.818
about the first two or three
years' worth of research

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:49.120
performed by the Russian
formalists,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.316
we probably wouldn't be having
an introductory survey course in

00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:55.490
the subject.
 

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.470
Speech is impeded by language
in two other ways.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.320
First of all-- second of all,
I should say,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:11.203
I suppose--speech is disturbed
by the way in which language

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:18.919
produces in what's being said an
uncontrollable semantic drift.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:20.590
That's what I want to call it.
 

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.735
In other words,
the language of an utterance is

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:30.100
crafted to say some particular
thing.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.870
Actually, it was Saussure,
in a work of his that's less

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.710
known than the Course in
General Linguistics,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.432
who published a monograph on
the way in which you can find

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:49.658
acronyms of various kinds buried
or embedded in Latin verse.

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:52.211
In other words,
there is meaning within meaning

00:14:52.211 --> 00:14:55.097
which can't possibly have been
planted there and yet,

00:14:55.097 --> 00:14:57.538
miraculously enough,
you can find there.

00:14:57.538 --> 00:15:01.198
You can recite a well-known
poem--the one that we took up

00:15:01.198 --> 00:15:04.727
last time because it was the
example given in Knapp and

00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:07.928
Michaels' "Against
Theory"--

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:09.613
you can recite a poem while
reading this:

00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:11.759
[referring to what is written
on the chalkboard:

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:16.970
A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears:

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.889
She seem'd a thing that could
not feel

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:22.429
The touch of earthly years.
 

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:29.090
No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.009
Roll'd 'round in earth's
diurnal course

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:37.190
With rocks, and stones,
and trees.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.346
Now you can see that to write
the poem in this way is to

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:45.804
perform an exercise which is
essentially what Joyce is doing

00:15:45.804 --> 00:15:47.769
in Finnegan's Wake.
 

00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:51.328
As a matter of fact,
as I transcribed the poem out

00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:53.678
of my notes [gestures to
board]--

00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:58.068
as you can see,
I transcribed it--I kept saying

00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:00.580
to myself,
"You know what?

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.970
This could be in Finnegan's
Wake."

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.539
I was actually quite
pleased with myself,

00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:04.289
as you can imagine.
 

00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:08.668
&gt;
 

00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:11.190
Notice that I have used all
words.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:16.700
There's nothing in these eight
lines which is not a word.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.840
I have certainly engaged in a
certain amount of anachronism,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.541
but I have also used
punctuation, and I have worked

00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:29.960
out ways in which this discourse
makes sense.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.918
I could have just left it at
nonsense--

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:35.029
like Lewis Carroll's
"'Twas brillig,

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.846
and the slithy toves / did gyre
and gimble in the

00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:39.985
wabe…"--
which is another way in which

00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:44.360
language is affected by
uncontrollable semantic drift.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.908
The point of Lewis Carroll's
famous nonsense verse is that we

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:53.609
all think we know what it means:
"'Twas blusterous and the

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:57.779
slimy toads did leap and frolic
in the waves."

00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:00.490
We think that it means
something like that,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.486
but semantic drift--which is
what Lewis Carroll deliberately

00:17:05.486 --> 00:17:10.011
introduces to it--
prevents us from in any secure

00:17:10.011 --> 00:17:13.788
way drawing any conclusions
about that.

00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:17.026
I, of course,
am making no claims for this

00:17:17.026 --> 00:17:21.604
transcription of Wordsworth's
"A Slumber Did My Spirit

00:17:21.604 --> 00:17:25.756
Seal" at all,
but maybe this can show us the

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:29.338
ways in which there is
semantic drift.

00:17:29.338 --> 00:17:33.240
Let's say that you were a
person not really,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.135
as Stanley Fish would put it,
in the interpretive community

00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:39.690
to which all the rest of us
belong,

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:43.519
and you don't really know what
a poem is.

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:48.234
Somebody recites in your
presence what I just recited to

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:48.750
you.
 

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.239
Well, if you were quick at
writing and you transcribed the

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:53.335
thing, you might very well
produce something like

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:54.818
that [points to board].
 

00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:59.268
In other words,
it wouldn't just spontaneously

00:17:59.268 --> 00:18:04.309
occur to you that what
Wordsworth wrote was what you

00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:08.665
were hearing,
and that's because the kind of

00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:13.647
semantic drift that I'm talking
about really is inescapably

00:18:13.647 --> 00:18:17.170
present in any utterance that we
make.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.853
The utterance is not often
mistaken because we're really

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:23.598
actually good at understanding
context.

00:18:23.598 --> 00:18:26.847
That's one of the reasons why
the so-called problem of

00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:30.710
communication isn't as great as
people sometimes claim it is.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.420
We're really good at
understanding context.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.971
Hence, we're not likely to go
badly wrong, but certainly there

00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:41.180
are occasions on which we go
badly wrong.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.422
As we all know,
that's the irritating thing

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.490
about spell check.
 

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.063
You put on spell check,
you write your term paper,

00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:49.690
you don't bother to edit it,
and you turn it in.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.421
It's full of howlers because,
of course, the language is full

00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:57.088
of homonyms, and spell check
always gives the wrong word.

00:18:57.088 --> 00:18:59.815
You're in the soup,
frankly because,

00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:04.486
of course, your teacher is just
kind of slapping his knee and

00:19:04.486 --> 00:19:06.900
guffawing while reading it.
 

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.548
&gt;
 

00:19:10.548 --> 00:19:12.990
In short, don't use spell
check, but spell check is

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.259
&gt;
 

00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:19.934
a phenomenon that shows you the
way in which semantic drift

00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:21.990
permeates language.
 

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.568
But it's not just that either.
 

00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:30.230
There's a third way in which
language impedes speech.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.218
Saussure never says this in so
many words, but this is

00:19:34.218 --> 00:19:37.529
definitely what he means by
langue.

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:40.200
Remember I said that language,
langue,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.749
is a virtual entity
because we could never actually

00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:48.660
encounter it written down in any
codified form.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.202
Yes, it is: the dictionary,
the lexicon,

00:19:52.202 --> 00:19:52.930
right?
 

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.150
But that's only part of it.
 

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.773
So far, notice that we've only
been talking about the lexicon

00:19:58.773 --> 00:20:01.009
when we talk about semantic
drift,

00:20:01.009 --> 00:20:04.490
but in addition to the lexicon,
language,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.939
langue,
is a set of rules--rules of

00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:11.953
grammar and syntax,
rules by means of which,

00:20:11.953 --> 00:20:17.009
and only by means of which,
speech can make sense.

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:20.190
In other words,
language has this sort of

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.358
bearing on the choices that we
can make while producing speech.

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:30.509
Unfortunately those rules can
be a little bit slippery.

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:35.192
When we talked about the
innocuous expression "It is

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.035
raining"
as an illustration of

00:20:38.035 --> 00:20:41.380
Jakobson's six sets of the
message,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.626
just as an example,
we were brought up short by the

00:20:45.626 --> 00:20:50.130
meta-lingual function of
"It is raining."

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.215
We suddenly asked ourselves,
"What on earth is

00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.390
‘it'?"
 

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.666
In other words,
there is a kind of grammatical

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:04.123
and syntactical permissibility,
obviously, in the expression

00:21:04.123 --> 00:21:08.568
"It is raining,"
but at the same time we really

00:21:08.568 --> 00:21:09.838
have no idea.
 

00:21:09.838 --> 00:21:17.194
It can lead us in strange
directions, this "it":

00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:21.324
Jupiter Pluvius,
God, the cosmos,

00:21:21.324 --> 00:21:23.259
the clouds.
 

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:27.670
Some of it is plausible but
none of it is definite.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.779
We realize that "it"
is a kind of placeholder in the

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:34.608
sentence that is not doing its
job and,

00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:36.279
believe me, it's not just in
English.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.820
As I said before,
it's a phenomenon that you can

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.391
find in any language,
even in the expression "It

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:43.051
is raining"--
il pleut,

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.368
es regnet,
and so on.

00:21:45.368 --> 00:21:48.240
In all of those expressions,
"it"

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.797
is not doing its job,
so that's another way in which,

00:21:52.797 --> 00:21:56.950
if we lean on a speech,
we have to realize that we're

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.304
in the presence of what the
economists again would call

00:22:00.304 --> 00:22:01.358
irrationality.
 

00:22:01.358 --> 00:22:08.121
That has to do with the way in
which predication works in

00:22:08.121 --> 00:22:09.450
language.
 

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.816
As I said before,
an assertion,

00:22:12.816 --> 00:22:18.990
a statement of truth--
an assertion of any kind is the

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.855
utterance of a metaphor,
because the deep structure of

00:22:23.855 --> 00:22:25.868
any assertion is that A is B.
 

00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:29.048
That is an assertion by
definition;

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:32.882
but--"A is B,"
and of course when that

00:22:32.882 --> 00:22:36.796
construction is grammatical--
in other words,

00:22:36.796 --> 00:22:41.509
when it makes what the
grammarians call a copula--

00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:44.318
when the construction is
grammatical,

00:22:44.318 --> 00:22:48.604
well, that's fine because we
understand that the relationship

00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:52.530
between A and B is not a
relationship that's insistently

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.255
one of identity;
that a connection is being

00:22:56.255 --> 00:23:00.140
made--a connection which de Man,
for example,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.288
would call metonymic--in
predication.

00:23:04.288 --> 00:23:08.253
The problem is that any
sentence which declares that A

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:10.881
is B metonymically--
that is to say,

00:23:10.881 --> 00:23:14.371
as a grammatical proposition--
is at the same time,

00:23:14.371 --> 00:23:18.098
if we simply look at the
sentence for what it is,

00:23:18.098 --> 00:23:24.230
which is a metaphor,
an insistence that A is

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.753
B in the sense that A is A--
is a metaphor,

00:23:28.753 --> 00:23:31.710
in other words which doesn't
stand on all fours.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.259
No metaphor does.
 

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:39.660
It has an element of what's
called catachresis in it,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.420
and therefore in a certain
sense, as we read the sentence,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.660
necessarily undermines the
sentence's grammatical

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.720
structure.
 

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.603
This is the point that de Man
is making in "Semiology and

00:23:52.603 --> 00:23:55.806
Rhetoric,"
that there is a perpetual

00:23:55.806 --> 00:24:00.450
tension in any utterance between
grammar and rhetoric.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.358
There is no utterance that's
not grammatical,

00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.108
there's no utterance that's not
rhetorical,

00:24:04.108 --> 00:24:08.836
but unfortunately grammar and
rhetoric are always rather

00:24:08.836 --> 00:24:12.618
openly or subtly at odds with
each other,

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:17.875
just in the way that metaphor
and predication really have to

00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:20.460
be at odds with each other.
 

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.169
In other words,
there isn't a sentence in which

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:29.169
the rules of grammar and syntax
are not subtly interfering with

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:32.960
what you might call the rules of
rhetoric--

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.279
the ways in which tropes,
in other words,

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:39.849
deploy themselves,
ways which can be distilled in

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:44.038
an understanding of what we call
metaphor.

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:48.258
So every sentence,
as I say, is shadowed not just

00:24:48.258 --> 00:24:53.497
by the vagaries of sound,
not just by semantic drift,

00:24:53.497 --> 00:24:58.950
but by the incompatibility of
grammar and rhetoric,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:05.144
and all of that is implicit in
what Saussure and his tradition

00:25:05.144 --> 00:25:06.769
call language.
 

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:09.338
Those are the ways,
in other words,

00:25:09.338 --> 00:25:13.970
in which language,
if I can put it this way,

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:20.913
speaks through speech,
the ways in which anything that

00:25:20.913 --> 00:25:27.990
we say on any occasion is
shadowed by another voice.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:34.410
We've understood this in social
terms as Bakhtinian polyglossia.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.027
We have understood this in
psychoanalytic terms as the

00:25:39.027 --> 00:25:43.210
discourse of the otherness of
the unconscious.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:48.661
We have understood this in
purely linguistic terms as

00:25:48.661 --> 00:25:52.327
language,
but we can, I think,

00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:59.098
metaphorically speaking,
understand it now as well as a

00:25:59.098 --> 00:26:01.038
kind of speech.
 

00:26:01.038 --> 00:26:06.440
Language is an unintentional
speech.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.655
Language is just that speech
which, we recognize--having gone

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:16.611
through the sort of analysis
that I've been attempting--is

00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:19.220
not governed by intention.
 

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.548
Keep in mind:
nobody--no theorist,

00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:27.580
nobody in his right mind--would
ever try to resist the claim

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.880
that speech is intentional,
that we intend what we say.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.179
That's the way in which Knapp
and Michaels are right and give

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:43.212
us a bracing reminder about
things where our skepticism is

00:26:43.212 --> 00:26:44.450
misplaced.
 

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.679
The idea that speech is somehow
not intended--what could that

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:50.288
mean?
 

00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:55.304
Speech just is
intention, but I've been trying

00:26:55.304 --> 00:26:59.955
to argue that there is a speech,
the "speech of

00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:02.710
language,"
which is unintentional,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.529
which is just there.
 

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:06.269
It can't be factored out.
 

00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:10.775
It can be bracketed,
but it can't be set aside as

00:27:10.775 --> 00:27:13.309
though it were not there.
 

00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:15.088
It will always come back.
 

00:27:15.088 --> 00:27:20.874
It will always confront us at
some point if we take the arts

00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:24.598
of interpretation seriously
enough--

00:27:24.598 --> 00:27:29.045
if, in other words,
we really do bring some

00:27:29.045 --> 00:27:33.914
pressure to bear on the things
that people say:

00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:39.776
not just a pragmatic pressure,
which I think works just fine

00:27:39.776 --> 00:27:43.465
for most of us,
but a pressure that goes beyond

00:27:43.465 --> 00:27:47.848
the pragmatic and notices what's
really in a sentence,

00:27:47.848 --> 00:27:53.009
what's really in anybody's
utterance.

00:27:53.009 --> 00:27:58.500
Language speaks through speech
partly as its origin.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.142
In other words,
the way language gets into

00:28:01.142 --> 00:28:04.815
something that you or I might
say is a reminder to us that

00:28:04.815 --> 00:28:07.200
what we say comes from
someplace.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.250
It has an origin and its origin
is precisely language.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.703
Language keeps saying,
"Oh, oh,

00:28:13.703 --> 00:28:15.667
here I am,"
your origin,

00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:16.368
right?
 

00:28:16.368 --> 00:28:20.046
The birth of what you're doing,
in other words,

00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:24.681
way back before you discovered
that language was useful for

00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:25.798
something.
 

00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:29.973
Remember what we said about
that last time:

00:28:29.973 --> 00:28:35.440
you have to discover that fire
is useful for cooking.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.680
Fire is not "for"
cooking.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.930
A cave is not for dwelling.
 

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.450
A prehensile thumb is not for
grasping.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.848
You have to discover the ways
in which this is the case.

00:28:47.848 --> 00:28:52.417
Language is there in what we
say to remind us that it wasn't

00:28:52.417 --> 00:28:57.539
always the case,
to remind us that it's just the

00:28:57.539 --> 00:29:04.960
origin of a history of conscious
expression during the course of

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.790
which we began the never-ending
process of trying to master

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.440
language.
 

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.308
That's, of course,
what it is to be a writer.

00:29:16.308 --> 00:29:19.490
You try to wrestle language
into submission.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.107
That's the ambition of all of
us, whether we're writing the

00:29:24.107 --> 00:29:27.930
great American novel or revising
a term paper.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.071
We're wrestling language into
submission, and we all know it's

00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:32.818
not easy.
 

00:29:32.818 --> 00:29:37.048
I'm just trying to explain some
of the reasons why it's not

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:37.558
easy.
 

00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:42.182
So language speaks through us
as the origin of speech,

00:29:42.182 --> 00:29:46.019
but it also speaks as the death
of speech.

00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:50.750
It speaks, in other words,
as the moment in which the

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:56.116
purposeful agency of speech is
finally called into question,

00:29:56.116 --> 00:29:59.210
in a certain sense undermined.
 

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.140
I think it's appropriate,
I think it's fair,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.880
to call language--again
metaphorically--

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.770
the epitaph of speech,
the way in which in any given

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:19.163
speech the end of its own agency
is inscribed even as that agency

00:30:19.163 --> 00:30:21.588
is going forward.
 

00:30:21.588 --> 00:30:27.147
Now I want to test this example
and also show you a little bit

00:30:27.147 --> 00:30:30.519
more about the way semantic
drift--

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:34.506
but even more than that about
the way the perilous

00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:39.470
relationship between grammar and
syntax and rhetoric works.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.000
I want to actually try out on
you a couple of epitaphs.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.405
If language is the epitaph of
speech, why not talk for a

00:30:47.405 --> 00:30:49.650
little bit about epitaphs?
 

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:56.608
Now my favorite epitaph by far:
probably--

00:30:56.608 --> 00:31:00.817
well, we won't speculate about
where such an epitaph might be

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:04.155
found,
but if and when you come across

00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:09.190
it walking through a cemetery,
it'll probably elicit a chuckle.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.881
On the gravestone it says,
"I told you I was

00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:12.609
sick."
 

00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:15.328
&gt;
 

00:31:15.328 --> 00:31:22.134
Now this is a very interesting
expression for a number of

00:31:22.134 --> 00:31:23.348
reasons.
 

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:28.651
For one thing,
and one should pause over this,

00:31:28.651 --> 00:31:34.777
one can infer speakers
speaking efficaciously,

00:31:34.777 --> 00:31:37.838
not just one but many.
 

00:31:37.838 --> 00:31:40.890
There's plenty of precedent for
this in Emily Dickinson and in

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.690
other writers.
 

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.201
The most obvious speaker is the
dead person speaking from the

00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:48.371
grave: "there I was,
sitting in the corner all those

00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:50.150
years telling you I had a
headache.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.460
You never listened to me"
and so on.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.200
That is the most obvious
identification of a speaker,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.660
but of course the speaker could
be somebody else,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.556
and I'm not introducing
a measure of skepticism in

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:06.278
saying this.
 

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:10.690
When we posit an intention,
we just decide which of these

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.028
speakers it is.
 

00:32:12.028 --> 00:32:16.670
The speaker could be an
apologetic relative,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:22.278
someone acknowledging that they
hadn't listened,

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:25.991
but with a sense of humor,
and so putting in the voice of

00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:29.413
the dead person the complaint,
"I told you I was

00:32:29.413 --> 00:32:31.940
sick" as a form of apology:
"Yes,

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.875
I know you did,
and unfortunately I had to go

00:32:34.875 --> 00:32:36.809
to the grocery store."
 

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:40.880
&gt;
 

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.019
That, too, can be the speaker.
 

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:48.785
Well, on the other hand,
it could be someone simply

00:32:48.785 --> 00:32:53.398
moralizing over the grave,
which is a frequent habit of

00:32:53.398 --> 00:32:55.903
the eighteenth century--
one of my periods,

00:32:55.903 --> 00:32:57.088
so I'm familiar with it.
 

00:32:57.088 --> 00:33:00.458
It could be a
philosopher--right?--saying,

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:03.663
"Well, this is the human
condition,

00:33:03.663 --> 00:33:05.799
&gt;
 

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:07.108
as I kept telling you.
 

00:33:07.108 --> 00:33:12.319
I published thirteen books,
the whole purport of which was

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:13.598
'I am sick.'
 

00:33:13.598 --> 00:33:17.049
I'm Dostoevsky's Underground
Man.

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:18.470
I am a sick man.
 

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.980
I am a very sick man.
 

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.190
Well, let it get worse."
 

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:27.355
It could be in this mode that a
philosopher is moralizing over

00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:31.759
the grave, or again it could be
a cultural critic.

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:36.671
It could be someone in a kind
of an allegorical mood

00:33:36.671 --> 00:33:41.680
inscribing on the gravestone the
death of culture.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.563
Civilization has been in a bad
way for a long time and here

00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:49.390
finally it lies.
 

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.818
The way to communicate this
would then be,

00:33:52.818 --> 00:33:56.613
"I told you I was sick:
civilization has ways of

00:33:56.613 --> 00:33:59.821
letting us know that all is not
well with it:

00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:05.519
we didn't pay any attention,
and here is the result."

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:10.985
I would say that all of those
ways of reading the epitaph are

00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:13.809
consistent with hermeneutics.
 

00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:19.143
They are consistent with the
way in which we can try to come

00:34:19.143 --> 00:34:23.030
to terms with the intention of a
speaker;

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.260
but suppose we say that
"language"

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.769
must be obtruding itself in
this utterance like any other.

00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:32.260
What would that be?
 

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.320
You see, that isn't just a
question of sound.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.610
It isn't even a question of
semantic drift,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.429
in this case.
 

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.858
It's a question of our suddenly
coming to understand the

00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:47.851
sentence in a way that perhaps
no individual speaker would want

00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:49.059
to give it.
 

00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:54.333
It's an allegory,
precisely, cleverly introduced

00:34:54.333 --> 00:35:00.280
by language,
about the inefficacy of speech.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.679
That's just the problem with
speech, isn't it?

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:07.817
"Again and again and again
I tell you something and you

00:35:07.817 --> 00:35:10.931
don't listen"--
that's the problem with being a

00:35:10.931 --> 00:35:12.489
lecturer,
&gt;

00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:17.302
that sort of "I told you I
was sick and you--"

00:35:17.302 --> 00:35:18.789
"Oh, well.
 

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:23.380
He's just joking."
 

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.490
So it is--according to the
allegory introduced by language

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:34.960
at the expense of speech--with
speech in general.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.556
It's an allegory about the
limits of communication because

00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:43.163
that's,
after all, what the

00:35:43.163 --> 00:35:47.690
speaker--insofar as there is a
speaker inscribing this

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.768
expression on the gravestone--
is concerned about.

00:35:51.768 --> 00:35:56.047
This person sitting in the
corner, complaining bitterly

00:35:56.047 --> 00:35:59.849
about nobody ever listening to
her or to him,

00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:05.061
is actually an allegorist
telling us that that's the way

00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:06.199
speech is.
 

00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:10.199
Speech, in other words,
has its limits.

00:36:10.199 --> 00:36:13.152
In a sense then,
when I say language is the

00:36:13.152 --> 00:36:16.208
epitaph of speech,
we realize that if we

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:19.440
understand this utterance as an
allegory,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.900
it is precisely speech that's
lying here--

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.242
the end, as I suggested,
of speech's powers of

00:36:26.242 --> 00:36:31.360
communication as announced or
declared by language.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.273
Well, let's try another one:
"Here lies John Doe,"

00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:42.139
probably the Ur-epitaph.
 

00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:48.300
Supply your own name:
"Here lies John Doe."

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:53.429
Well, let's not even pause over
the speaker there.

00:36:53.429 --> 00:36:58.219
Let's get immediately to the
problems posed by language.

00:36:58.219 --> 00:37:04.597
In the first place,
John Doe obviously does not lie

00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:09.190
precisely "here,"
right?

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:14.657
In fact, if you think about it,
it's altogether possible that

00:37:14.657 --> 00:37:19.489
John Doe could be absolutely
anywhere except precisely

00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:23.681
"here,"
because where the sentence is

00:37:23.681 --> 00:37:26.690
we know John Doe not to be.
 

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.679
He could be anyplace else,
as I say.

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:35.449
So any epitaph is therefore a
self-declared cenotaph,

00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:40.960
an inscription on a place where
the body isn't,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.920
which of course tells us a lot,
too,

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.909
about the arbitrary nature of
language.

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:48.260
Language does not hook on to
the real world.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.920
It doesn't hook on to the body.
 

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.510
The one place where language is
not is on the body.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.309
The one place where language is
not is on things.

00:37:59.309 --> 00:38:00.579
Speech is on things.
 

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:06.190
Speech can be inscribed on a
piece of rock.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.530
So "Here lies John
Doe," except not here,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.800
anyplace but here--which is
why, of course,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.092
the interest of the word
"lies"

00:38:16.092 --> 00:38:17.239
is so interesting.
 

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:19.289
&gt;
 

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:26.809
The utterance is a lie,
but it's not John Doe who lies.

00:38:26.809 --> 00:38:29.199
Poor John Doe is just lying
someplace.

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:32.820
John Doe is not lying, right?
 

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.260
It's language
&gt;

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:44.842
that's making speech lie,
and it's doing it on any number

00:38:44.842 --> 00:38:48.980
of levels, as we've seen.
 

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.431
It's a funny thing about
epitaphs, and this has been

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:58.583
noted by certain authors writing
in the tradition of what we

00:38:58.583 --> 00:39:01.987
loosely call
"deconstruction":

00:39:01.987 --> 00:39:07.226
the epitaph is a particularly
fruitful locus for the study of

00:39:07.226 --> 00:39:11.329
the ways in which language
challenges,

00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:17.059
undermines, and displaces
speech, and as I say,

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:23.570
these two examples show more or
less the way that works.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:30.610
So speech lies everywhere
except here--

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.760
I don't mean
here!--speech lies

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.510
because it can never stop being
language,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:44.315
and therefore we can never
really possibly mean exactly

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.079
what we say.
 

00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:50.210
We can mean what we say,
but we can't mean exactly what

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.900
we say.
 

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:56.351
That's probably the most
commonsensical way of putting

00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.690
the matter.
 

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.777
When Stanley Cavell poses the
question in the title of one of

00:40:00.777 --> 00:40:02.938
his books, Must We Mean What
We Say?

00:40:02.938 --> 00:40:04.380
&gt;
 

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.751
he is actually offering us the
possibility that maybe that's

00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:11.409
not the be all and end all of
speaking, &gt;

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:16.760
that the speech-act situation
is more complicated than that.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.561
Sure, we all have it at heart
as an objective to mean what we

00:40:22.561 --> 00:40:25.003
say,
but at the same time in

00:40:25.003 --> 00:40:28.070
speaking we are performing,
we're acting,

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.530
as the neo-pragmatist would
suggest,

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.809
and we're doing all kinds of
things besides meaning.

00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:37.306
That really needs to be taken
into account,

00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:41.219
even in understanding what
speech can do,

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:45.550
let alone in understanding what
speech can't do.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:51.940
So it's plausible to say that
yes, we can mean what we say;

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.733
but it's a question--indeed,
it's a very insistent

00:40:55.733 --> 00:40:59.760
question--whether we can mean
exactly what we say.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.786
Now you ask--you must ask,
because after all it's been our

00:41:05.786 --> 00:41:09.289
constant guide--
you ask, "Does language

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:11.690
speak in Tony the Tow
Truck?"

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:16.416
I know this has been on your
mind, and so of course we have

00:41:16.416 --> 00:41:17.719
to address it.
 

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.840
I think there are a few
interesting things to be said

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.369
about that.
 

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:26.028
I spoke earlier in the semester
about the parade on the vertical

00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:30.699
axis, of that vertical axis,
called "I."

00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:34.242
As you read the text,
there it is,

00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:36.820
&gt;
 

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.927
sort of out of Lacan,
out of Lacanian feminism,

00:41:39.927 --> 00:41:43.170
however you look:
the phallogocenter right there,

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.050
I.
 

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:49.170
But now I is never the
first word spoken by an infant.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.679
That's another lesson of Lacan.
 

00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:55.699
I is what you have to
learn how to be--

00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:58.989
maybe to put it in Judith
Butler's terms--

00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:01.043
so that I,
insofar as it is this

00:42:01.043 --> 00:42:03.855
incredible upright pillar
starting one sentence after

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.909
another in Tony the Tow
Truck,

00:42:05.909 --> 00:42:09.864
is a promise of,
precisely, agency:

00:42:09.864 --> 00:42:16.110
the promise of the kind of
identity which stands upright,

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:21.047
which is a successful
simulacrum of what is seen in

00:42:21.047 --> 00:42:24.838
the mirror,
and which then develops into

00:42:24.838 --> 00:42:27.989
what Freud called,
referring to the way in which

00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:30.260
infants begin to get their way
in the world,

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.710
"his majesty the ego."
 

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.242
So the I has that
function, but as I've said,

00:42:36.242 --> 00:42:40.469
it's a story about friendship,
and the I disappears.

00:42:40.469 --> 00:42:44.686
This, too, I think,
can be communicated as relevant

00:42:44.686 --> 00:42:49.831
to the infant in ways that at
the functional level of language

00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:52.699
can't really be called speech.
 

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:57.724
For example,
the friendship exists between

00:42:57.724 --> 00:42:59.440
Bumpy [pron.
 

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.059
BUM-py]
and Tony [pron.TO-ny],

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:06.126
uh-oh:
long before the baby says

00:43:06.126 --> 00:43:09.740
"I,"
it says "uh-oh,"

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.800
and that "uh-oh"
resonates in the friendship of

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.880
Bumpy and Tony.
 

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880
Why "uh-oh?"
 

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.869
Because Tony is stuck and
Tony's natural response to being

00:43:22.869 --> 00:43:26.018
stuck would be,
"Uh-oh."

00:43:26.018 --> 00:43:29.340
Along comes Bumpy
and--"uh-oh"--not only

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.070
recognizes the problem but takes
care of the problem.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.929
Now on the other hand,
the problem of self,

00:43:36.929 --> 00:43:41.650
the problem that's caught up in
this vertical I,

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:47.342
comes into focus for the infant
as the awareness of otherness or

00:43:47.342 --> 00:43:49.329
that which is alien.
 

00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:55.291
That which is irreducible to
the self begins to come into

00:43:55.291 --> 00:43:58.079
focus,
and a way of expressing this is

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:00.440
to say,
"e-e-e-e,"

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.023
which is perhaps in some way or
another a mask or a simulacrum

00:44:06.023 --> 00:44:08.768
of "he-he-he-he."
 

00:44:08.768 --> 00:44:13.277
I think it's for that reason
that the two antagonists of the

00:44:13.277 --> 00:44:16.869
story, the unassimilable others
who do not help,

00:44:16.869 --> 00:44:19.010
are called Speedy [pron.
 

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.771
SPEE-dee]
and Neato [pron.

00:44:20.771 --> 00:44:22.039
NEE-to].
 

00:44:22.039 --> 00:44:25.320
In other words,
that sense of otherness--

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.809
of that which is intractable,
that which cannot be reduced

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:37.161
effectively to self--
is I think articulated in

00:44:37.161 --> 00:44:39.239
"e-e-e."
 

00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:41.726
In other words,
what the infant speaks is not

00:44:41.726 --> 00:44:42.630
speech, is it?
 

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.840
It's language.
 

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.150
If you want to hear language in
speech, just listen to a baby.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:54.500
That's why nonsense verse has
such appeal to young children.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.268
They're still hearing language.
 

00:44:56.268 --> 00:45:00.447
It's a way of putting
Wordsworth's "Intimations

00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:01.429
Ode."
 

00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:06.800
They're still hearing the
mighty waters rolling evermore.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:15.750
They're hearing "ohm"
where we're all hearing speech.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.289
As I say, ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny.

00:45:20.289 --> 00:45:23.864
The history of the human
species is a history of coming

00:45:23.864 --> 00:45:26.643
to terms with speech,
mastering speech--or,

00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:29.690
I should say,
perhaps, mastering language.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.809
Well, so it is in the
individual.

00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:37.005
The individual who is hard
wired--isn't he?--for language

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:42.664
must somehow or another wrestle
that hard wiring in to what we

00:45:42.664 --> 00:45:44.150
call speech.
 

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:47.010
So the first thing we hear in
an infant,

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.358
and maybe what is most
predominant in stories for

00:45:50.358 --> 00:45:54.135
toddlers and in nonsense verse,
is language,

00:45:54.135 --> 00:45:58.590
which you don't reduce
semantically,

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.139
you don't parse it semantically.
 

00:46:00.139 --> 00:46:04.639
Sure, I've just interpreted it
into a kind of meaning,

00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:10.561
but it's a meaning which comes
simply from the observation of

00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:16.188
feelings and noticing what
children actually say on actual

00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:19.958
occasions,
which can't really be called

00:46:19.958 --> 00:46:24.782
speech but is rather a kind of
experimentation with language

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.480
dragging itself toward speech.
 

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.635
It's not anything that one
would ever really confuse with

00:46:31.635 --> 00:46:36.086
speech, yet partly an imitation
of what is heard in the adult

00:46:36.086 --> 00:46:36.829
world.
 

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:39.150
That's where you get
"uh-oh."

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.739
But when the adult occasionally
says,

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:44.673
"Uh-oh,"
there's nothing like the

00:46:44.673 --> 00:46:49.005
investment in it that there is
in the child for whom it is very

00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:51.590
often the first articulate
sound.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:57.237
It is the encounter with
otherness and the attempt to

00:46:57.237 --> 00:47:01.025
master otherness,
as in Freud's story of

00:47:01.025 --> 00:47:05.172
fort/da,
that this "uh-oh"

00:47:05.172 --> 00:47:07.289
seems to be expressing.
 

00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:08.289
All right.
 

00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:09.840
So much for Tony.
 

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:16.018
I'd just like to
confuse--I'd like to conclude

00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:18.539
with three theses.
 

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:22.840
Well, you have to speak very
carefully or language obtrudes.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.003
I had to say very
carefully "three

00:47:26.003 --> 00:47:27.550
theses,"
right?

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.400
And of course I made a mistake
just before.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.815
I didn't want to say
"confuse,"

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:34.300
did I?
 

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.300
&gt;
 

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.626
Notice that "confuse"
was not just anything getting

00:47:38.626 --> 00:47:40.289
in the way of communication.
 

00:47:40.289 --> 00:47:42.295
It was precisely what I
did not want to say

00:47:42.295 --> 00:47:43.360
&gt;
 

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.760
--precisely.
 

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.391
I could have said anything
else, but I said

00:47:47.391 --> 00:47:48.768
"confuse."
 

00:47:48.768 --> 00:47:51.489
That is the Freudian slip that
I've been talking about.

00:47:51.489 --> 00:47:52.949
Well, anyway,
&gt;

00:47:52.949 --> 00:47:57.539
three theses about language.
 

00:47:57.539 --> 00:48:00.269
First, it never makes
sense.

00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:03.780
Language does not make sense.
 

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.460
It's arbitrary.
 

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.664
It is a system of arbitrary
signs that are not natural

00:48:10.664 --> 00:48:11.449
signs.
 

00:48:11.449 --> 00:48:14.559
You make sense,
not language.

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:18.980
You make sense by invoking an
intention--

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.059
that is to say,
by having an intention--

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:26.119
and wrestling language into
speech: that is,

00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:30.039
commandeering language for your
purposes.

00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:33.659
Language doesn't make sense;
you make sense.

00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:37.759
Language in itself,
secondly, says nothing about

00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:41.509
reality just because it is a
system, a code,

00:48:41.509 --> 00:48:44.300
a system of arbitrary signs.
 

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.987
I want to put it two different
ways to show you what's going

00:48:47.987 --> 00:48:48.300
on.
 

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:54.559
You come to terms,
as we say, with reality.

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:58.724
That is to say,
you find the words for reality

00:48:58.724 --> 00:49:00.389
as you grasp it.
 

00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:04.768
Another way to put it is you
figure it out.

00:49:04.768 --> 00:49:06.603
In other words,
you come to understand what

00:49:06.603 --> 00:49:09.143
language is,
"I figured it out,"

00:49:09.143 --> 00:49:11.550
but of course in rhetorical
theory,

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.961
"figure"
is precisely a figure of

00:49:13.961 --> 00:49:14.659
speech.
 

00:49:14.659 --> 00:49:20.929
You bring to bear figures just
as you come to terms.

00:49:20.929 --> 00:49:24.440
You bring to bear figures on
reality.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.409
You figure it out.
 

00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:31.994
Finally, to adapt an expression
with which you're probably

00:49:31.994 --> 00:49:35.454
familiar,
I'll conclude simply by saying

00:49:35.454 --> 00:49:39.532
that the road to reality is
paved with your

00:49:39.532 --> 00:49:42.440
intentions,
be they good or bad.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.300
Thank you very much.

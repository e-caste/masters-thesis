00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.746
Professor Christine
Hayes: So as we saw last

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:07.269
week, before we stopped to talk
about the priestly materials and

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.624
the Holiness Code--as we saw
last week, the covenant ceremony

00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:13.476
at Sinai included God's
announcement of and Israel's

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:16.440
agreement to certain covenantal
stipulations.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.018
So Exodus 24:3 and 4,
describe this agreement as

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.422
follows:
Moses went and repeated

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:26.270
to the people all the commands
of the lord and all the rules;

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.413
and all the people answered
with one voice,

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:31.730
saying "All the things that the
lord has commanded we will do!"

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.000
Moses then wrote down all the
commands of the Lord.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.653
So the covenant concluded at
Sinai is the climactic moment in

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:40.420
the Pentateuchal narrative.
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.088
And it came to be viewed as the
initiation of God's articulation

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:49.090
of the laws and rules and
ordinances and instruction by

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.500
which the ancient Israelites
were to live.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.515
And so later editors
consequently inserted law

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:59.336
collections from later times and
circles into the story of

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:01.950
Israel's meeting with God at
Sinai,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.650
and subsequent sojourn in the
wilderness.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.031
This was done in order to lend
these collections an air of high

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.650
antiquity and to give them
divine sponsorship.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.501
The conclusion of biblical
scholarship is that a number of

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:18.353
separate bodies of law have
gravitated to the story of the

00:01:18.353 --> 00:01:22.069
40-year period of Israel's
formation into a people.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.972
So that's the period of the
covenant at Mount Sinai and then

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:26.939
the journey towards the Promised
Land.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.731
All Israelite law is
represented in the biblical

00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:34.120
account as having issued from
that time,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.200
that 40-year period of intimate
contact between God and Israel.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.124
So on your handout,
I've given a division,

00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.907
a rough division,
of the different legal

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:48.260
collections that we have in the
Pentateuch.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.558
The laws that scholars will
often refer to as the JE laws,

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:53.873
since they sort of are
introduced by that

00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:57.345
narrative--some people think
it's best to just think of these

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:59.891
as separate legal
collections--those occur in

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.578
Exodus.
And so they tend to be dated

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:05.370
tenth-ninth century in their
written form.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.807
The laws of the priestly
material are mostly going to be

00:02:07.807 --> 00:02:10.706
found in Leviticus and Numbers,
and those will be formulated

00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:13.169
somewhere from the eighth to the
sixth century.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.958
Same period of time roughly we
have the laws of D,

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.520
which are found,
obviously, in Deuteronomy.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.917
But these sources themselves
are clearly drawing upon much

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:23.050
older traditions.
 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.139
Some of the individual laws are
clearly quite ancient.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.806
They have a great deal in
common with Ancient Near Eastern

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:30.678
legal traditions,
generally of the second

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:32.745
millennium.
The laws of Exodus,

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:37.058
for example--some of them bear
such similarity to the Code of

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:41.083
Hammurabi that we can really
assume that they are drawing

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:45.108
upon a common legal heritage:
Canaanite law or what would

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:48.990
have been known as a legal
tradition in Canaan.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.585
So whatever their actual
origin, however,

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:55.220
the bible represents these
materials as having been given

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.400
at Sinai or during that 40-year
period after.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.871
So given at Sinai,
now this is on your sheet,

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:04.130
you have the Decalogue--not
very well translated as the Ten

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.490
Commandments--we'll come back to
that.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.993
Covenant code,
so that's a chunk of material,

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.530
three chapters in Exodus.
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.941
Then we have a small passage
referred to as a ritual

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.399
Decalogue--we'll come back to
that--you have priestly

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.000
legislation--a little bit in
Exodus about the cult,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.840
obviously, then on into
Leviticus and some Numbers.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.927
According to the biblical
narrative then,

00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:26.798
the following materials were
given in the 40 years after

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.588
Sinai,
as the Israelites are encamped

00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:30.787
in the wilderness on their
journey toward the land of

00:03:30.787 --> 00:03:33.438
Israel.
So those are presented as

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:38.430
supplements in Numbers,
but also the Deuteronomic code.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.770
Let's talk a little bit now
about the Decalogue.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.080
There was a scholar by the name
of Alt, A-L-T.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.951
Albrecht Alt,
a German scholar who examined

00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:52.099
the legal material of the Bible
in general.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.319
And he noticed that there were
really two forms of law.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.699
Yeah--these things I forgot to
write down .

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.780
There's conditional law and
apodictic law.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.500
Conditional law is case law,
casuistic law.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.900
And then there's absolute or
apodictic law.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.099
He noticed these two forms.
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.209
Casuistic law is the common
form that law takes in the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.931
Ancient Near East,
and you've seen it in the Code

00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:24.543
of Hammurabi.
It has a characteristic if/then

00:04:24.543 --> 00:04:27.043
pattern.
Casuistic law tells you,

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.945
for example,
if a person does X or if X

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:33.230
happens, then Y will be the
consequence.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.310
It can be complex.
 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.060
It can be quite specific.
 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.058
If X happens,
Y is the consequence,

00:04:38.058 --> 00:04:41.116
but if X happens under these
different circumstances,

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.879
then Z is the consequence.
 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.207
And it can be quite detailed
giving three or four sub-cases

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.470
with qualifications.
 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.004
Absolute or apodictic law,
by contrast,

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:54.139
is an unconditional statement
of a prohibition or a command.

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.280
It tends to be general and
somewhat undifferentiated.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.589
You shall not murder.
 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.110
You shall love the lord your
God.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.251
And absolute law,
apodictic law,

00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.912
is not unknown as a form in
other Ancient Near Eastern

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:09.207
cultures,
but it seems to be most

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:11.029
characteristically Israelite.
 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.360
You find a great deal more of
it in our legal collections in

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.110
the Bible than anywhere else.
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.693
The provisions of the
Decalogue--and again,

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.768
the translation Ten
Commandments is actually a very

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:24.053
poor translation;
in the Hebrew,

00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:28.312
it simply means ten statements,
ten utterances--the ones that

00:05:28.312 --> 00:05:32.500
are in some sort of legal form,
are in absolute or apodictic

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.141
form.
The Decalogue is the only part

00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.681
of God's revelation that is
disclosed directly to all of

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:40.870
Israel without an intermediary.
 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.009
But its directives are couched
in the masculine singular.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.356
So it seems to be addressing
Israelite males as the legal

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:49.029
subjects in the community.
 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.754
And the Decalogue sets out some
of God's most basic and

00:05:52.754 --> 00:05:55.029
unconditional covenant demands.
 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.410
The division into ten is a bit
awkward.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.024
It probably should be seen as
an ideal number,

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:02.579
an effort to find ten
statements in there.

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:04.607
Because, in fact,
there are really about 13

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:05.670
separate statements.
 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.940
And we see the fact that ten
doesn't work very well in a very

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.106
interesting phenomenon,
which is that the so-called

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.035
commandments are actually
numbered differently by Jews and

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:19.220
by Christians and then even
within the Christian community,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.145
different Christian
denominations number the

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:23.562
commandments one through ten
quite differently from one

00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:25.356
another.
They disagree about what is

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:27.449
number one and what is number
two and so on.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.989
The first statements,
either one through four or one

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.079
through five depending on your
counting,

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:35.004
but the first group of
statements concern Israel's

00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:37.569
relationship with her suzerain,
with God.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.699
She's to be exclusively
faithful to God.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.750
She's not to bow down to any
manmade image.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.029
She may not use God's name in a
false oath, to attest to or

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:48.800
swear by a false oath.
 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.417
She is to honor God's Sabbath
day, and honor parental

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:56.800
authority, which is arguably an
extension of God's authority.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.106
The remaining statements then
concern Israel's relationship

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:02.329
with her fellow vassals,
if you will.

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:06.751
And they prohibit murder and
adultery and robbery,

00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:09.910
false testimony and
covetousness.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.931
It's important to realize that
the Pentateuch contains three

00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:15.839
versions of the Decalogue.
 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.100
And there are differences among
them.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.808
The Decalogue is going to be
repeated in Deuteronomy,

00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:22.896
chapter five.
And there are some minor

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:25.079
variations.
Specifically you'll see that

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:28.029
the rationale for observing the
Sabbath is different.

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:33.173
God's name in Deuteronomy 5 is
not to be used in a vain oath as

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:35.329
opposed to a false oath.
 

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.129
There are differences in the
meaning.

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:39.290
And there are some more
differences too in language.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.360
So what are we to make of this?
 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.786
One scholar,
Marc Brettler,

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:45.693
whose name I've mentioned
before, he says that what we

00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:47.844
learn from this,
these variations,

00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:51.193
is something about the way
ancient Israel preserved and

00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:52.930
transmitted sacred texts.
 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.381
They didn't strive for verbatim
preservation when they

00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.269
transmitted biblical texts.
 

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.114
And they didn't employ cut and
paste methods that might be

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.660
important to us in the
transmission of something.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.000
Texts were modified in the
course of their transmission.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.399
Verbatim repetition was not
valued in the way that it might

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:13.831
be for us.
So that even a text like the

00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:17.199
Decalogue, which is represented
as being the unmediated word of

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.589
God, can appear in more than one
version.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:22.343
There's a more surprising
variation that occurs,

00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:23.750
however, in Exodus 34.
 

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.040
After smashing the first set of
tablets that were inscribed with

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.899
the Decalogue--the tablets in
Exodus 20,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:34.180
those are smashed after the
golden calf incident--Moses is

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.309
then given a second set of
tablets.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.095
And the biblical writer
emphasizes in the story at that

00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:42.086
point that God writes on the
tablets the words that were on

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.150
the former tablets that were
broken.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.652
The same words.
So we expect now a verbatim

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.590
repetition of Exodus 20.
 

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.409
And yet we don't have it.
 

00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:54.498
The Decalogue that follows in
fact has very little overlap

00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:56.070
with the earlier Decalogue.
 

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.166
There's really only two
statements that even have the

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:01.198
same content.
And even those,

00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:04.690
which do overlap in content,
vary in wording.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.821
This Decalogue,
which is often called the

00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:09.113
ritual Decalogue,
so it's listed on there in

00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:11.181
Exodus 34,
bans intermarriage with

00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:14.800
Canaanites less they entice the
Israelites into worship of their

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.311
gods.
It has other terms that give

00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.120
commandments about the
observance of the festivals,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.850
various festivals,
the dedication of first fruits

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.490
to God, the dedication of first
born animals to God and so on;

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.860
things that were not in the
Exodus 20 Decalogue.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.423
So evidently,
there were different traditions

00:09:33.423 --> 00:09:35.870
regarding the contents of the
Decalogue.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.423
And the story of the golden
calf and Moses' destruction of

00:09:39.423 --> 00:09:43.227
the first set of tablets is a
brilliant narrative strategy for

00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:46.220
introducing this second
Decalogue tradition.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.867
Also surprising is the fact
that the Decalogue in Exodus 20

00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:53.200
doesn't stand completely
unchallenged in the Bible.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.936
Exodus 20, verses 5 through 6,
contain explicitly the

00:09:56.936 --> 00:10:00.169
principle of inter-generational
punishment.

00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:03.523
God is said to spread
punishment for sin out over

00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:05.480
three or four generations.
 

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.960
This is understood as a sign of
his mercy.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.009
It's reducing the punishment on
the actual sinner by spreading

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:13.610
it out and limiting the
consequences to only three or

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.255
four generations,
in contrast to what is said in

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:18.542
the next verse,
that kindness he spreads out

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:20.138
over thousands of generations.
 

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:22.895
Right?
So it's seen as merciful mode

00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:24.833
of operation.
But the notion of

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.984
intergenerational punishment is
something that some segments of

00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:30.779
the community or perhaps later
in time was rejected?

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:33.059
Some segments of the community
rejected this notion.

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:36.340
And so in Deuteronomy 7,
we see that quite pointedly.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.816
"God punishes only those who
spurn him, and does so

00:10:39.816 --> 00:10:42.074
instantly."
Ezekiel, when we get to

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:45.665
Ezekiel, we'll see that he will
also very adamantly reject the

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:48.019
idea of intergenerational
punishment.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:50.401
The children do not suffer for
the sins of the father,

00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:53.190
only the father.
So what are we to make of this?

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.917
Again, Marc Brettler concludes
that the Decalogue or Decalogues

00:10:57.917 --> 00:11:02.415
did not originally possess the
absolute authority that is so

00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:05.159
often claimed for it even today.
 

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:08.685
Later religious traditions have
elevated the Decalogue in Exodus

00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:10.980
20 to a position of absolute
authority.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.544
A position that's not
completely justified given the

00:11:14.544 --> 00:11:17.690
Bible's own fluid treatment of
the wording,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.523
the Decalogue's text,
and its content,

00:11:20.523 --> 00:11:24.429
and its later objection even to
one of its terms.

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:28.006
So the claim that God's
revelation of the Decalogue was

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:31.450
fixed in form--the words that we
see in Exodus 20,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.161
for example--and immutable in
substance is not a claim that's

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:38.750
really native to or even
justified by the biblical text.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.059
It's a later ideological
imposition upon the text.

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:45.634
And I want to talk a little bit
more about biblical law's

00:11:45.634 --> 00:11:48.116
connection with the legal
patrimony of the Ancient Near

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:50.148
East.
Because certainly biblical law

00:11:50.148 --> 00:11:53.116
shares in that patrimony,
even if sometimes it's clearly

00:11:53.116 --> 00:11:55.118
reforming it.
So it's helpful and it's

00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:58.059
instructive to compare it with
other ancient law collections.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.936
And I hope you've had time to
sit and read--there was a study

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:03.717
guide posted on the website and
I hope you had time to work

00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:05.060
through these materials.
 

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.309
They're fascinating.
 

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.814
And we'll see that there are
certain key features that

00:12:08.814 --> 00:12:11.650
distinguish Israelite law from
the other Ancient Near Eastern

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.690
legal collections.
 

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.009
I've also put on the handout
for today just a list of those

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:18.070
collections: the Laws of
Ur-nammu,

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.835
the Laws of Lipit-Ishtar,
the Laws of Eshnunna,

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:23.059
the Code of Hammurabi,
which is CH,

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:26.187
the Hittite laws,
the youngest laws would be the

00:12:26.187 --> 00:12:29.514
middle Assyrian laws,
giving you rough dates and so

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:31.316
on.
So you have that to refer to

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.990
for the information about these
particular collections.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.976
I should also say that we would
do better to understand these

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:41.100
materials as legal collections
and not codes.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.307
I know the word code gets
thrown around a lot,

00:12:43.307 --> 00:12:44.780
Code of Hammurabi and so on.
 

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.970
But they really aren't codes.
 

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.368
Codes are generally systematic
and exhaustive and they tend to

00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:51.809
be used by courts.
 

00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:55.009
We have no evidence about how
these texts were used.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:57.322
In fact, we think it's not
likely that they were really

00:12:57.322 --> 00:12:59.686
used by courts.
But they were part of a learned

00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:02.799
tradition and scribes copied
them over and over and so on.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:05.789
They are also certainly not
systematic and exhaustive.

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:07.720
So for example,
in the Code of Hammurabi,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.230
we don't even have a case of
intentional homicide.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.840
We only have a case of
accidental homicide.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.977
So we really don't even know
what the law would be in a case

00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:14.919
of intentional homicide.
 

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.713
We can't really make that
comparison with the biblical

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.389
law.
Now, in a very important

00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:22.559
article that was written nearly
half a century ago now,

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:25.759
it's hard to believe,
by a man named Moshe

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:29.973
Greenberg--he's a biblical
scholar and he argued that a

00:13:29.973 --> 00:13:34.422
comparison of biblical law with
other Ancient Near Eastern

00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:38.792
collections reveals the central
postulates or values that

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:41.289
undergird biblical law .
 

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.200
I'll be drawing extensively on
Greenberg's work in this

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.487
presentation as well as other
scholars who have picked up some

00:13:47.487 --> 00:13:50.559
of his ideas and have taken them
in other directions.

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:53.438
But it was really Greenberg who
was the one who I think made the

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:55.860
first foray into this kind of
comparative approach,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.320
and since then others have
taken advantage of that idea.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.915
There is, Greenberg says,
an immediate and critically

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:07.063
important difference between
Ancient Near Eastern collections

00:14:07.063 --> 00:14:10.450
and the Israelite laws as
they're presented by the

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.110
biblical narrator.
 

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.080
And that's a difference in
authorship.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.623
So if you look,
for example,

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.881
at the prologue to the laws of
Ur-nammu: An and Enlil gave

00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:22.090
kingship to Ur-nammu,
but Ur-nammu is said to

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.490
establish equity and the laws.
 

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.581
If you look at Lipit-Ishtar,
both the prologue and the

00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:30.696
epilogue: An and Enlil,
the gods, give kingship to

00:14:30.696 --> 00:14:33.309
Lipit-Ishtar,
but Lipit-Ishtar establishes

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:35.685
justice.
He refers to the laws as "my

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.600
handiwork" in the first person.
 

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.080
Or the prologue to the Code of
Hammurabi.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.685
Again, lofty Anum and Enlil
established for him an enduring

00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:46.946
kingdom.
They name him "to promote the

00:14:46.946 --> 00:14:49.726
welfare of the people…cause
justice to prevail… When

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:52.507
Marduk commissioned me… to
direct the land" and now it

00:14:52.507 --> 00:14:55.287
continues in first person
speech: "I established law and

00:14:55.287 --> 00:14:58.220
justice in the language of the
land…At that time,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.428
(I decreed):
the laws of justice," the laws

00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:02.690
that the efficient King
Hammurabi set up.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.972
"I wrote my precious words on
my stela," which you can go and

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:09.200
see at Sterling Memorial Library
"and in the presence of the

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.087
statue of me,
the king of justice,

00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:13.530
I set up in order to administer
the law of the land,

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.590
to prescribe the ordinances of
the land,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.250
to give justice to the
oppressed."

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.143
And he refers to it as "my
justice," "my statutes," no one

00:15:20.143 --> 00:15:21.259
should rescind them.
 

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:23.570
"My inscribed stela,"
"my precious words."

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.710
Do not alter the law of the
land which "I" enacted;

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.259
I, I, I throughout.
 

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:32.049
By contrast in biblical law,
authorship is not ascribed to

00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:35.159
Moses, ever.
It is attributed always to God.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:38.816
So you see in Exodus 24:3 and
4: Moses went and repeated to

00:15:38.816 --> 00:15:42.600
the people all the commands of
the lord and all the rules;

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.511
and all the people answered
with one voice,

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:47.470
saying "All the things that the
lord has commanded we will do!"

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.519
Moses then wrote down all the
commands of the Lord.

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:53.314
It's the repetition that makes
you feel that the biblical

00:15:53.314 --> 00:15:56.009
writer here is not accidentally
saying these things,

00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.149
trying to drive home a very
strong point.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:01.661
Exodus 31:18:
"When he finished speaking with

00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:05.492
him on Mount Sinai,
He gave Moses the two tablets

00:16:05.492 --> 00:16:08.531
of the Pact,
stone tablets inscribed with

00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:09.789
the finger of God."
 

00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:11.448
So Greenberg,
and since him,

00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:14.887
Brettler, and many others,
have argued that the principle

00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:18.879
of divine authorship has certain
very important implications.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:23.549
First, it has a significant
effect on the scope of the law.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:27.057
Ancient Near Eastern and
biblical law differ concerning

00:16:27.057 --> 00:16:30.695
the areas of human life and
activity that fall within the

00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:32.190
concern of the law.
 

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.153
That doesn't mean they don't
fall within the concern of

00:16:34.153 --> 00:16:36.080
humanity, they just fall within
concern of the law.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.909
That's an idea I'll come back
to in a minute.

00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:42.785
Israelite law will contain more
than just rules and provisions

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:47.581
that fall within the scope of
the coercive power of the state

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:50.408
to enforce.
More than what would fall under

00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:52.666
the jurisdiction of law courts,
for example,

00:16:52.666 --> 00:16:53.770
or legal decisors.
 

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.852
It is holistic.
The scope of the law is

00:16:56.852 --> 00:16:58.900
holistic.
It's going to contain social

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.669
and ethical and moral and
religious prescriptions,

00:17:01.669 --> 00:17:04.537
and very often they're going to
be couched in an authoritative,

00:17:04.537 --> 00:17:06.498
apodictic style,
particularly the things that

00:17:06.498 --> 00:17:08.029
aren't enforceable in a court of
law.

00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:10.207
They will tend to be the ones
that are backed up by the

00:17:10.207 --> 00:17:11.981
authority of God directly:
you shall do this,

00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:13.069
I the Lord am your God.
 

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.190
Notice how many times that
refrain is used.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.643
And it's almost always used
with those unenforceable kinds

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.366
of things.
Love your neighbor as yourself,

00:17:20.366 --> 00:17:21.690
you know, I the Lord am your
God.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.053
It's me who's watching out for
this one, not the court,

00:17:25.053 --> 00:17:26.874
okay?
The extra-biblical law

00:17:26.874 --> 00:17:30.146
collections deal almost
exclusively with matters that

00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:32.160
are enforceable by the state.
 

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.890
That doesn't necessarily mean
they were.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.339
We don't know how these were
used.

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:38.279
But they don't tend to deal
with matters that we would call,

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:40.472
we would call,
matters of conscience or moral

00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:42.958
rectitude.
So you'd be very hard pressed

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.103
in the extra-biblical
collections to find a law like

00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:49.041
Exodus 23:4 and 5:
When you encounter your

00:17:49.041 --> 00:17:52.259
enemy's ox or ass wandering,
you must take it back to him.

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:54.961
When you see the ass of your
enemy lying under its burden,

00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:57.189
and you would refrain from
raising it, you must,

00:17:57.189 --> 00:17:59.180
nevertheless,
raise it with him.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.443
Or Leviticus 19:17 and 18:
"You shall not hate your

00:18:02.443 --> 00:18:04.140
kinsfolk in your heart."
 

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.029
Can you imagine Congress
passing a law like that?

00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:08.559
"You shall not hate your
kinsfolk in your heart.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:11.051
Reprove your kinsmen,
but incur no guilt because of

00:18:11.051 --> 00:18:12.279
him."
And don't carry around a grudge.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:13.701
Reprove him,
tell him what's wrong,

00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:15.799
clear the air.
Don't carry around a grudge.

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:17.948
"You shall not take vengeance
or bear a grudge against your

00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:20.724
countrymen.
Love your fellow as yourself:

00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:24.309
I am the Lord."
That refrain always comes after

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:26.329
those kinds of statements.
 

00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:30.735
So the Bible includes norms for
human behavior set by the divine

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:35.001
will, even though enforcement
has to be left to the individual

00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:37.102
conscience.
And in the Torah,

00:18:37.102 --> 00:18:40.446
therefore, life is treated
holistically in the realm of

00:18:40.446 --> 00:18:41.954
law.
One's actions aren't

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.210
compartmentalized,
and that's why the legal

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.433
materials to us can sometimes
seem like an indiscriminate mix

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:49.690
of laws concerning all areas of
life.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.769
And it's one of the things that
makes people confused.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:54.350
Because a lot of moderns have
gotten the idea that the Bible

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.099
only deals with what we call
morality.

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:58.523
And so they don't understand
all this other stuff that's in

00:18:58.523 --> 00:19:00.025
there, right?
And sometimes if we tell

00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:01.594
ourselves, well,
this is a legal collection,

00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:03.710
then we don't understand why
there's all this moral-looking

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.038
stuff in there.
It is a mixture because it's

00:19:06.038 --> 00:19:07.539
holistic.
It is the will of God,

00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:09.819
and God has something to say
about all areas of life.

00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:12.352
And so in Exodus 23,
you're going to have a law that

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.984
tells you not to oppress a
stranger because you were a

00:19:14.984 --> 00:19:17.029
stranger.
It tells you to not plow your

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:19.586
land in the Sabbath year
immediately following that to

00:19:19.586 --> 00:19:21.420
let the poor and needy eat from
it.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.430
It tells you to observe the
Sabbath day rest.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.099
You shall not mention any other
gods.

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:28.308
It tells you how to observe the
three pilgrimage festivals and

00:19:28.308 --> 00:19:31.569
rules of ritual offering and
then there are also civil laws.

00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:33.750
Same thing in Leviticus:
18 through 20.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.121
We have incest laws,
we have ritual laws,

00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:39.500
we have civil laws and we have
moral laws all together.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.150
Now, a second
implication--another idea that

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.787
flows from the fact that this
law is divinely authored--so a

00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:48.500
second implication of divine
authorship,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.510
according to Greenberg,
is this connection between law

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.520
and morality so that in the
biblical, legal framework,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.790
every crime is also a sin.
 

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.500
Every crime is also a sin.
 

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.217
Law is the moral will of God
and nothing is beyond the moral

00:20:04.217 --> 00:20:06.484
will of God.
So what's illegal is also

00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:09.640
immoral, and vice versa;
what's immoral is also illegal.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.078
Law and morality are not
separate, as we moderns tend to

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:16.579
think they are and ought to be,
right, in our society.

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.807
Offenses against morality in
the biblical world are also

00:20:19.807 --> 00:20:21.039
religious offenses.
 

00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:24.723
They're also sins because they
are infractions of the divine

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:27.229
will.
So the fusion of morality and

00:20:27.229 --> 00:20:31.010
law, Greenberg argues,
is the reason that biblical law

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.449
not only expresses,
but legislates a concern for

00:20:34.449 --> 00:20:37.720
the unfortunate members of
society, for example;

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.623
orphans, strangers,
widows, as well as respect for

00:20:41.623 --> 00:20:44.163
the aged.
From the Priestly source,

00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:47.824
this is Leviticus 19:32,
we read, "You shall rise before

00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:50.620
the aged and show deference to
the old;

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.380
you shall fear your God.
 

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.746
I am the Lord."
Again, that refrain always has

00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:55.339
to come with this kind of a
statement.

00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:58.458
The extra-biblical codes
certainly exhibit concern for

00:20:58.458 --> 00:20:59.930
the rights of the poor.
 

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.100
This is very important,
particularly in their

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.338
prologues.
We've read some of these

00:21:02.338 --> 00:21:04.930
prologues.
You know, my desire was to help

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.589
the orphans, the strangers and
so on.

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:11.035
But when you look at the
content of the laws,

00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:14.950
as in our society,
they don't legislate charity.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.759
They don't legislate compassion.
 

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:20.292
It's likely that these were
considered acts of,

00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:23.052
who knows, personal conscience,
religious conviction,

00:21:23.052 --> 00:21:25.835
something that was between the
individual and society and their

00:21:25.835 --> 00:21:26.833
God.
I don't know,

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:29.726
but they were outside the
domain and jurisdiction of the

00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:32.035
court.
That doesn't mean that charity

00:21:32.035 --> 00:21:35.705
and compassion were not present
in other Ancient Near Eastern

00:21:35.705 --> 00:21:37.832
cultures.
The point is that law is not

00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:40.318
understood as being the
appropriate vehicle for the

00:21:40.318 --> 00:21:41.809
expression of those values.
 

00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:44.427
There were other sorts of texts
that might do those sorts of

00:21:44.427 --> 00:21:46.690
things and urge people to
charity and compassion.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.681
But law, the legislation,
is not understood to be the

00:21:49.681 --> 00:21:52.960
appropriate vehicle for the
expression of those values.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.802
So again, I'm not trying to say
that in Ancient Near Eastern

00:21:54.802 --> 00:21:57.347
society, everybody was mean,
I'm trying to say that law,

00:21:57.347 --> 00:22:00.444
because of its divine
authorship, suddenly takes on a

00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:02.424
scope,
a holistic scope and a fusion

00:22:02.424 --> 00:22:05.364
of law and morality that are
kept separate in other cultures

00:22:05.364 --> 00:22:06.760
and very much in our own.
 

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.210
 
 

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.839
So the two, however,
are combined.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:15.740
And law is understood to be the
appropriate vehicle to legislate

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.349
compassion, for example.
 

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:21.609
So in Leviticus 19:9,
verse 10, legislating charity,

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:23.275
When you reap the harvest
of your land,

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.434
you shall not reap all the way
to the edges of your field,

00:22:25.434 --> 00:22:27.099
or gather the gleanings of your
harvest.

00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:29.030
You shall not pick your
vineyard bare,

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.430
or gather the fallen fruit of
your vineyard.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.795
You shall leave them for the
poor and the stranger:

00:22:33.795 --> 00:22:36.976
I, the Lord am your God.
Again, from the Holiness Code,

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:39.588
Leviticus 19:14,
"You shall not insult the deaf,

00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:42.200
or place a stumbling block
before the blind.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.079
You shall fear your God:
I am the Lord."

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:46.375
Again, always has to back it up
because this is not something

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:47.599
the courts can back up,
right?

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:49.599
This is a question of your
morality.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:52.400
Or Leviticus 20:18 "Love your
fellow as yourself.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.977
I am the Lord."
Leviticus 19:33-34:

00:22:54.977 --> 00:22:58.192
"When a stranger resides with
you in your land,

00:22:58.192 --> 00:23:00.079
you shall not wrong him.
 

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:03.199
The stranger who resides with
you shall be to you as one of

00:23:03.199 --> 00:23:05.603
your citizens;
you shall love him as yourself,

00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:07.745
for you were strangers in the
land of Egypt:

00:23:07.745 --> 00:23:09.190
I, the Lord,
am your God."

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.750
Deuteronomy 22:6:
"If, along the road,

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.962
you chance upon a bird's nest,
in any tree or on the ground

00:23:15.962 --> 00:23:18.953
with fledglings or eggs and the
mother sitting over the

00:23:18.953 --> 00:23:22.378
fledglings or on the eggs,
do not take the mother together

00:23:22.378 --> 00:23:24.165
with her young.
Let the mother go,

00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:26.932
and take only the young,
in order that you may fare well

00:23:26.932 --> 00:23:29.650
and have a long life," meaning
God will reward you.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.009
So again, this is enforceable
by God.

00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:35.304
Furthermore,
Greenberg argues that the fact

00:23:35.304 --> 00:23:40.167
that every crime is also a sin
lays the ground for certain acts

00:23:40.167 --> 00:23:43.069
to be viewed as absolutely
wrong,

00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:47.150
and transcending the power of
humans to forgive.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.747
Absolutely wrong and they
transcend the power of humans to

00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:52.010
pardon or forgive.
 

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.430
Take for an example, adultery.
 

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.264
Deuteronomy 22:22:
"If a man is found lying with

00:23:57.264 --> 00:24:00.158
another man's wife,
both of them--the man and the

00:24:00.158 --> 00:24:02.450
woman with whom he lay--shall
die.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.350
Thus, you will sweep away evil
from Israel."

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.019
And murder is the other one.
 

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:10.464
Numbers 35:16,
"…the murderer must be put to

00:24:10.464 --> 00:24:14.675
death…" "You may not accept a
ransom for the life of a

00:24:14.675 --> 00:24:18.350
murderer" "who is guilty of a
capital crime;

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.400
he must be put to death."
 

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.916
In the view of the biblical
text, adultery and murder are

00:24:23.916 --> 00:24:25.109
absolutely wrong.
 

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:29.142
They must always be punished
regardless of the attitude of

00:24:29.142 --> 00:24:30.769
the offended parties.
 

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:32.465
So a husband can't say "Oh,
that's okay,

00:24:32.465 --> 00:24:35.130
I don't want to punish my wife;
let them have their fun.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.089
It's no big deal;
I don't mind." Alright?

00:24:38.089 --> 00:24:40.568
And the family of a murder
victim can't say,

00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:43.393
"You know, Joe was such a pain
in the neck anyway,

00:24:43.393 --> 00:24:45.930
you've really done us a favor,
you know?

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.100
Just pay the funeral costs,
we'll call it quits."

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.500
You can't do that.
 

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.250
These are absolutely wrong.
 

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.860
These deeds,
as infractions of God's will,

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.279
and God's law,
they're always wrong.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:25:00.142
They transcend the power of
human parties to pardon or

00:25:00.142 --> 00:25:01.599
forgive or excuse.
 

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:04.013
And you compare that with the
extra-biblical collections and

00:25:04.013 --> 00:25:05.200
you see quite a difference.
 

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.947
In the Code of Hammurabi,
number 129, adultery is

00:25:08.947 --> 00:25:11.289
considered a private affair.
 

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:14.837
"If the wife of a seignor"--and
I have to-- this terminology is

00:25:14.837 --> 00:25:16.799
just wonderful.
Seignor.

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:20.180
This comes, I think,
from French feudalism.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.839
These have to do with class
distinctions.

00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:26.479
And so the translators of this
particular translation chose

00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:30.118
these feudal--very meaningful to
you I'm sure--these feudal

00:25:30.118 --> 00:25:32.339
categories.
Essentially what's going on

00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:34.519
here is the underlying Akkadian
words, I guess,

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:36.178
are awilum,
mushkenum,

00:25:36.178 --> 00:25:37.980
and then a third category,
slave.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.998
When the three--when they
appear together,

00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:42.608
awilum tends to refer to
an upper class person,

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.430
a mushkenum to a
commoner.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.421
Awilum can just mean an
ordinary citizen,

00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:48.581
but when it's in juxtaposition
with the other terms,

00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:50.700
it's clearly someone of a
higher social class.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.351
So we'll use aristocrat,
which is where we get the

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:56.218
French feudal seignor,
and then we'll use commoner and

00:25:56.218 --> 00:25:58.571
slave.
So in the Code of Hammurabi,

00:25:58.571 --> 00:26:02.259
"If the wife of a citizen has
been caught while lying with

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:04.494
another man,
they shall bind them and throw

00:26:04.494 --> 00:26:05.380
them into the water.
 

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.739
But if the husband of the woman
wishes to spare his wife,

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:09.720
then the king in turn may spare
his subject."

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.540
It's up to the husband.
 

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.780
He's the offended party.
 

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.090
It's a private matter.
 

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.795
He decides.
The middle Assyrian laws on

00:26:15.795 --> 00:26:17.589
Tablet A numbers 14 to 16.
 

00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:19.955
Again, it's a crime against the
property of the husband,

00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:22.450
and so it's within his power to
either prosecute or not.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.335
"If a seignor," an awilum has
lain with the wife of another,

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:30.089
either in a temple brothel or
in the street knowingly,"

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:33.069
knowing that she was a wife,
"then they shall treat the

00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:36.269
adulterer as the seignor orders
his wife to be treated."

00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:37.916
Okay?
So whatever he does to her,

00:26:37.916 --> 00:26:39.819
they do the same thing to the
male.

00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:42.468
But if he was innocent,
he didn't know that she was a

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:44.607
married woman,
"the seignor shall prosecute

00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:46.900
his wife, treating her as he
thinks fit."

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.481
It's up to him.
"If… the woman's husband,"

00:26:49.481 --> 00:26:52.307
more ifs and thens,
but here's a case of "if… the

00:26:52.307 --> 00:26:54.680
woman's husband puts his wife to
death,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.096
he shall also put the seignor
to death, but if he cuts off his

00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.194
wife's nose,
he shall turn the seignor into

00:27:00.194 --> 00:27:02.734
a eunuch"--I guess this is
considered equivalent--"and they

00:27:02.734 --> 00:27:04.180
shall mutilate his whole face.
 

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.577
However, if he let his wife go
free, they shall let the seignor

00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:10.349
go free."
Again, it's a private matter.

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:13.338
In the Hittite laws as well,
Tablet 2,197-198,

00:27:13.338 --> 00:27:16.259
the husband can decide to spare
his wife,

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:19.230
If he brings them to the
gate of the palace and declares:

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.008
"My wife shall not be killed'
and thereby spares his wife's

00:27:22.008 --> 00:27:24.304
life,
he shall also spare the life of

00:27:24.304 --> 00:27:26.650
the adulterer and shall mark his
head.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.289
But if he says,
"Let them die both of them!"

00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:29.911
…[then]
the king may order them killed,

00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:31.980
[but also], the king may spare
their lives.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.080
And we see the same sorts of
distinctions in murder cases.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.549
We'll come back to them later.
 

00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:40.376
A third implication or
consequence of the divine

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:43.268
authorship of biblical law,
according to Greenberg,

00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:46.364
is that the purpose of the law
in Israelite society is going to

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:49.509
be different from the purpose of
the law in other societies.

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:54.276
So in non-Israelite society the
purpose of the law is to secure

00:27:54.276 --> 00:27:56.890
certain sociopolitical benefits.
 

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.930
Think about the preamble of the
American Constitution,

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.109
which states the purpose of the
law.

00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:04.470
It reads almost exactly like
the prologues to these ancient

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.840
collections.
You can pick out words that are

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.981
identical.
The purpose of the law is to

00:28:08.981 --> 00:28:11.609
"establish justice,
insure domestic tranquility,

00:28:11.609 --> 00:28:15.119
provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare,

00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:17.440
and secure the blessings of
liberty."

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.508
So when you see the prologue of
Ur-nammu, the purpose of the

00:28:20.508 --> 00:28:23.116
law: "establish equity,"
protect the underprivileged,

00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:25.269
promote the common weal and
welfare, basically.

00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:28.347
The Laws of Lipit-Ishtar in the
prologue: "establish justice…

00:28:28.347 --> 00:28:30.285
banish complaints,"
I like that one,

00:28:30.285 --> 00:28:33.420
"bring wellbeing"--promote the
common weal and welfare.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.039
Same again with the Code of
Hammurabi's prologue:

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:38.932
to promote the welfare of the
people, good government,

00:28:38.932 --> 00:28:40.569
the right way,
prosperity.

00:28:40.569 --> 00:28:43.608
But for Israel,
the law does include these

00:28:43.608 --> 00:28:47.240
benefits, but is not limited to
these benefits.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.369
The law also aims at
sanctifying.

00:28:50.369 --> 00:28:52.861
A concept we dealt with at
great length in the last

00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:54.375
lecture.
Sanctifying,

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:59.200
rendering holy or like God
those who abide by its terms.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.226
So the laws that are presented
in the Holiness Code are

00:29:03.226 --> 00:29:06.805
introduced with this
exhortation, which you don't

00:29:06.805 --> 00:29:08.670
find in other places.
 

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.227
Leviticus 19:2:
"You shall be holy for I,

00:29:11.227 --> 00:29:13.210
the Lord your God,
am, holy."

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.265
And then the laws begin;
"You shall each revere your

00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:17.125
mother and father,… keep my
Sabbath," etcetera,

00:29:17.125 --> 00:29:18.925
etcetera.
But the introduction,

00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:22.549
"You shall be holy for I the
Lord your God am holy"--being

00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:26.046
holy in imitation of God is
emphasized repeatedly as the

00:29:26.046 --> 00:29:29.670
purpose of the laws in the
Holiness Code especially.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.188
The holiness motif is
represented as being present at

00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.980
the very inception of the
covenant.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.805
When Israel is assembled at
Mount Sinai, that opening speech

00:29:37.805 --> 00:29:40.269
that God makes in Exodus 19:5
and 6,

00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:43.708
"Now then, if you will obey Me
faithfully and keep My covenant,

00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:45.806
keep my laws,
you shall be My treasured

00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:47.529
possession among all the
peoples.

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:50.138
Indeed, all the earth is Mine,
but you shall be to Me a

00:29:50.138 --> 00:29:52.069
kingdom of priests and a holy
nation."

00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:56.709
These are the rules that
demarcate you as dedicated to

00:29:56.709 --> 00:29:58.109
me; i.e.
holy.

00:29:58.109 --> 00:30:01.843
Now, there are lots of general
and specific similarities and

00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:05.640
parallels between Israelite and
Ancient Near Eastern laws.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.698
Lots of goring oxen,
lots of pregnant women who are

00:30:08.698 --> 00:30:12.246
in the wrong place at the wrong
time and getting struck and

00:30:12.246 --> 00:30:14.019
accidentally miscarrying.
 

00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:17.480
But we're going to look at some
of the formal and stylistic

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.059
differences between Ancient Near
Eastern and biblical law.

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:23.393
And we can assume just a
tremendous amount of common

00:30:23.393 --> 00:30:25.490
ground, okay?
And some of these are pointed

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.680
out by Greenberg and some by
other scholars.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.480
But I've listed them there
under "features."

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.108
One distinguishing feature of
Israelite law is the addition of

00:30:35.108 --> 00:30:39.130
a rationale or a motive clause
in many of the laws.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.029
Which again is not something
that's really featured in the

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:46.450
genre of law writing in these
other collections.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.369
It's not a part of the genre of
writing those.

00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:50.200
It doesn't mean they didn't
have a rationale,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.740
but it wasn't how it was
presented.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.166
So we find this in the Bible
particularly in what we might

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:57.329
refer to as the humanitarian
laws.

00:30:57.329 --> 00:31:01.505
And on the whole,
these rationales will appeal to

00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:05.680
historical events like the
exodus or creation.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.208
Here are a few laws that
express the idea that the

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:12.736
experience of slavery and
liberation should be the

00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:15.039
wellspring for moral action.
 

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.460
It should be the impetus for
moral action.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.317
Exodus 22:20:
"You shall not wrong a stranger

00:31:20.317 --> 00:31:23.175
or oppress him,
for you were strangers in the

00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:26.102
land of Egypt."
23:9: "You shall not oppress a

00:31:26.102 --> 00:31:28.978
stranger, for you know the
feelings of the stranger,

00:31:28.978 --> 00:31:32.250
having yourselves been
strangers in the land of Egypt."

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.447
And Leviticus 19 contains a
similar exhortation not to wrong

00:31:35.447 --> 00:31:38.833
a stranger who resides with you,
but "love him as yourself for

00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:41.069
you were strangers in the land
of Egypt."

00:31:41.069 --> 00:31:44.943
Likewise, in Deuteronomy 5
--this is the Decalogue in

00:31:44.943 --> 00:31:49.190
Deuteronomy--which is talking
about Sabbath observance,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.196
and ensuring that all in your
abode rest "…you,

00:31:52.196 --> 00:31:54.990
your son or your daughter,
your male or female slave,

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.789
your ox or your ass,
or any of your cattle…"

00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:59.598
"stranger in your settlements,
so that your male and female

00:31:59.598 --> 00:32:00.980
slave may rest as you do.
 

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.946
Remember that you were a slave
in the land of Egypt and the

00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:05.890
Lord your God freed you from
there."

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.342
Also , "For the Lord your God
is God supreme and Lord supreme,

00:32:09.342 --> 00:32:12.681
the great, the mighty and the
awesome God who shows no favor

00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.040
and takes no bride."
 

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.210
Takes no bride also!
 

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.587
But takes no bribe "…but
upholds the cause of the

00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:20.060
fatherless and the widow,
and befriends the stranger,

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.009
providing him with food and
clothing.

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:24.381
you too must befriend the
stranger, for you were strangers

00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:25.380
in the land of Egypt."
 

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.354
We have two rationales there;
one is the explicit rationale

00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:29.789
of imitatio dei.
 

00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:33.570
This is what I do and this is
what you should do.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.359
And there are more.
 

00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:38.326
Many of them referring to the
exodus in Egypt and others

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:40.970
referring to the notion of
imitatio dei.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:44.816
So it's also illuminating to
compare the Ancient Near Eastern

00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:48.855
and the biblical legal materials
in terms of the concern for the

00:32:48.855 --> 00:32:52.585
disadvantaged,
the elimination of social class

00:32:52.585 --> 00:32:55.161
distinctions,
and a trend toward

00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:58.556
humanitarianism.
Greenberg notes that the

00:32:58.556 --> 00:33:02.339
Torah's concern for the
disadvantaged of society is

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:05.819
quite marked in the actual laws
themselves.

00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:08.767
Many of the extra-biblical
legal collections pay homage to

00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:10.369
this idea in their prologues.
 

00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:13.064
It doesn't always seem to be
appearing, however,

00:33:13.064 --> 00:33:15.529
in the actual terms of these
collections.

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:17.130
Now, these collections are
incomplete.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.230
We don't have everything.
 

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.548
And again, it may be another
literary genre that accomplished

00:33:21.548 --> 00:33:23.539
some of that work in that
culture.

00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:27.509
The Torah laws-- And also,
the laws in those collections

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:31.263
very often, despite the
prologues' rhetoric that they

00:33:31.263 --> 00:33:34.799
bring justice to the
disadvantaged and so on,

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:38.880
many of the laws clearly serve
the interests of an upper class.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.329
Okay, that's the more important
point.

00:33:40.329 --> 00:33:42.920
They clearly serve the
interests of an upper class.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.653
The Torah laws do not contain
all the same distinctions of

00:33:46.653 --> 00:33:50.584
social class among free persons
as the contemporary laws--the

00:33:50.584 --> 00:33:53.710
Laws of Eshnunna,
the Laws of Hammurabi.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.135
These laws distinguish between
punishments for crimes committed

00:33:58.135 --> 00:34:01.204
against upper class and lower
class persons,

00:34:01.204 --> 00:34:03.059
not to mention slaves.
 

00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:08.479
So if we look at the Code of
Hammurabi, there's a stretch of

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:11.969
laws numbering 195 to 208
something.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.720
And they're--very interesting
to read them all in a row.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.349
I'll hit some highlights.
 

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:19.762
So if an upper class person,
if an aristocrat has destroyed

00:34:19.762 --> 00:34:22.999
the eye of a member of the
aristocracy, they destroy his

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:25.245
eye.
If he breaks his bone,

00:34:25.245 --> 00:34:26.940
they break his bone.
 

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.417
But as you move down to 198,
if he destroys the eye of a

00:34:30.417 --> 00:34:34.274
commoner or breaks the bone of a
commoner, he pays one mina of

00:34:34.274 --> 00:34:36.068
silver.
And if it's a slave,

00:34:36.068 --> 00:34:38.099
he pays half the value of the
slave.

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.425
On to 200 and 201:
If he knocks out an

00:34:40.425 --> 00:34:43.380
aristocrat's tooth,
they knock out his tooth.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.875
But if it's a commoner's tooth,
he pays a third of a mina of

00:34:46.875 --> 00:34:48.059
silver, and so on.
 

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:52.087
The Hittite laws too:
there are different amounts

00:34:52.087 --> 00:34:55.275
fixed by class in the
miscarriage laws,

00:34:55.275 --> 00:34:57.735
95 and 99.
The middle Assyrian laws also

00:34:57.735 --> 00:34:59.375
distinguish between the
awilum,

00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:01.059
the mushkenum and the
slave.

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:07.277
Leviticus 24:17-22--we have,
there, laws of personal

00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:09.781
liability;
bodily injury,

00:35:09.781 --> 00:35:12.610
assault and battery or bodily
injury.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.805
And we find a clear and
explicit statement to the effect

00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:19.639
that there shall be one standard
for citizen and stranger alike.

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:25.062
This is known as the principle
of talion;

00:35:25.062 --> 00:35:27.599
lex talionis.
 

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:31.219
So reading from Leviticus,
"If anyone maims his fellow."

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:35.016
"If anyone maims his fellow,
as he has done so shall it be

00:35:35.016 --> 00:35:38.147
done to him: fracture for
fracture, eye for eye,

00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:41.033
tooth for tooth.
The injury he inflicted on

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:44.259
another shall be inflicted on
him… You shall have one

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:46.588
standard for stranger and
citizen alike:

00:35:46.588 --> 00:35:48.619
for I the Lord,
am your God."

00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:51.500
This was a radical concept in
its day, evidently.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.366
The punishment should fit the
crime, no more and no less for

00:35:55.366 --> 00:35:59.495
all free persons--granted slaves
are not included--regardless of

00:35:59.495 --> 00:36:02.710
social class.
Equality before the law.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.927
And this casts the principle of
talion,

00:36:04.927 --> 00:36:06.159
I hope, in a new light.
 

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:08.411
The law of talion,
which is essentially the

00:36:08.411 --> 00:36:11.075
principle that a person should
be punished according to the

00:36:11.075 --> 00:36:13.820
injury they inflicted,
it's been decried as a

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.469
primitive, archaic reflex of the
vengeance or vendetta principle.

00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:22.228
The notion of "an eye for an
eye" is usually cited or held up

00:36:22.228 --> 00:36:25.861
as typical of the harsh and
cruel standards of the vengeful

00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:27.239
Old Testament God.
 

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:30.432
But when you look at it in a
comparative light in its legal

00:36:30.432 --> 00:36:33.295
context, we see that it's a
polemic against the class

00:36:33.295 --> 00:36:36.103
distinctions that were being
drawn in antecedent and

00:36:36.103 --> 00:36:39.949
contemporary legal systems,
such as the Code of Hammurabi.

00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:42.268
According to the Bible,
the punishment should always

00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:45.133
fit the crime regardless of the
social status of the perpetrator

00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:47.269
on the one hand or the victim on
the other.

00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:51.438
All free citizens who injure
are treated equally before the

00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:53.626
law.
They're neither let off lightly

00:36:53.626 --> 00:36:55.099
nor punished excessively.
 

00:36:55.099 --> 00:36:57.448
If you read the middle Assyrian
laws, don't want to do that on

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.179
an empty stomach.
 

00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:01.820
A.20, A.21 and F1--you have
multiple punishments that are

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.762
carried out.
Someone who causes a

00:37:03.762 --> 00:37:05.724
miscarriage: they have a
monetary fine,

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.460
they have to pay two talents
and 30 minas of lead.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.553
They're flogged 50 times and
then they have to do

00:37:10.553 --> 00:37:12.516
corvée,
forced labor for the state for

00:37:12.516 --> 00:37:14.150
a month.
Multiple punishments.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.989
For sheep stealing,
that's even worse.

00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:18.862
You're flogged 100 times and
they pull out your hair and

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:21.473
there's a monetary fine,
and you do corvée,

00:37:21.473 --> 00:37:23.039
forced labor,
for a month.

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:26.519
So are these ideas--is this
idea that the punishment should

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:28.739
be neither too little nor too
much,

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:32.297
it should match the crime,
that all free persons are equal

00:37:32.297 --> 00:37:35.105
before the law,
that one standard should apply

00:37:35.105 --> 00:37:38.600
regardless of the social status
of the perpetrator or the

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.469
victim--are these ideas really
primitive legal concepts?

00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:46.052
In addition to asserting the
basic equality before the law

00:37:46.052 --> 00:37:49.321
for all free citizens,
the Bible mandates concern for

00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:50.829
the disenfranchised.
 

00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:53.872
We've already seen that a
little bit in the laws of

00:37:53.872 --> 00:37:56.611
Leviticus 19:9-10,
which says that you have to

00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:58.335
leave,
you know, don't go over your

00:37:58.335 --> 00:37:59.849
fields picking every little last
bit.

00:37:59.849 --> 00:38:01.656
You know, just go through,
get what you need,

00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:03.833
but leave a little bit behind
and let the poor and the

00:38:03.833 --> 00:38:04.860
stranger glean there.
 

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.909
Deuteronomy is a little less
generous.

00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:10.982
They substitute the phrase "the
widow, the orphan and the

00:38:10.982 --> 00:38:14.910
stranger" in that law where
Leviticus says the poor.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.543
Deuteronomy 24:20-22:
When you beat down the

00:38:18.543 --> 00:38:20.986
fruit of your olive trees,
[or gather the grapes of your

00:38:20.986 --> 00:38:22.014
vineyard;
see note 2]

00:38:22.014 --> 00:38:23.230
do not go over them again.
 

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.288
That [which remains on the
tree]

00:38:24.288 --> 00:38:25.928
shall go to the stranger,
the orphan [see note 3]

00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:27.806
and the widow… Always
remember you were a slave in the

00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.885
land of Egypt,
therefore do I enjoin you to

00:38:29.885 --> 00:38:32.804
observe this commandment.
So Leviticus supports outright

00:38:32.804 --> 00:38:34.880
charity for the poor in the form
of gleanings.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.909
Kind of a welfare system.
 

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:38.070
Deuteronomy has more of a
workfare system in mind;

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.139
they actually never mention the
poor.

00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:41.449
It's only Leviticus that
mentions the poor.

00:38:41.449 --> 00:38:44.041
For Deuteronomy,
it's those who really can't

00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:47.175
provide for themselves:
the widow, the orphan and the

00:38:47.175 --> 00:38:50.310
stranger who may not be able to
find employment.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.449
The poor should be working.
 

00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:55.270
But you can assist them with
loans, according to Deuteronomy.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.440
And these should be generous.
 

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.836
Here's Deuteronomy's admonition
to loan money to the poor even

00:39:00.836 --> 00:39:04.011
if it means potential loss to
yourself because the seventh

00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:06.349
year is imminent;
the sabbatical year.

00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:08.873
In the sabbatical year,
all debts were released,

00:39:08.873 --> 00:39:09.840
cancelled.
Okay?

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.429
Sort of an economic corrective
to restore people to a more

00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:15.130
equal economic situation.
 

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.587
So in the sixth year,
some people will feel 'I don't

00:39:17.587 --> 00:39:19.130
really want to lend money out.
 

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.410
It's going to be cancelled next
year.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.630
I won't get my money back.'
 

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.500
Loans must be made even if the
debt will be cancelled,

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.857
for the simple reason that the
problem of poverty is a terrible

00:39:27.857 --> 00:39:29.320
and persistent problem.
 

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.006
Deuteronomy 15:7-11:
If there is among you a

00:39:33.006 --> 00:39:35.843
poor man, one of your brethren,
you shall not harden your heart

00:39:35.843 --> 00:39:38.039
or shut your hand against your
poor brethren,

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:40.931
but you shall open your hand to
him and lend him sufficient for

00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:42.329
his need whatever it may be.
 

00:39:42.329 --> 00:39:45.318
Beware lest you harbor the base
thought, 'the seventh year,

00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:48.152
the year of debt release is
approaching' so that you are

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:50.780
mean to your poor kinsman and
give him nothing.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.611
You shall give to him freely,
and your heart shall not be

00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:56.595
grudging when you give to him,
for the poor will never cease

00:39:56.595 --> 00:39:59.014
out of the land.
Alright, the poor will always

00:39:59.014 --> 00:40:00.983
be with you.
This is where it comes from,

00:40:00.983 --> 00:40:02.510
but it gets misquoted later.
 

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.378
It's taken to mean the poor are
always with you,

00:40:04.378 --> 00:40:05.769
so you don't have to do
anything.

00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:07.050
That's not what it means here
in Deuteronomy.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.794
Lend to them because the poor
will never cease out of the

00:40:09.794 --> 00:40:12.490
land," therefore I command you,
open wide your hand."

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.889
Get busy, give charity.
 

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:17.429
It's a problem that never goes
away, so you can never rest.

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:21.030
Connected with this is the
biblical trend towards

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.216
humanitarianism.
And there is,

00:40:23.216 --> 00:40:26.946
of course, much in biblical
legislation that offends modern

00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:30.308
sensibilities.
There's no point in pretending

00:40:30.308 --> 00:40:31.670
that there isn't.
 

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.500
For example,
as in the rest of the ancient

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.710
world, slavery existed in
Israel.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.027
It did.
Even so, and this is not to

00:40:39.027 --> 00:40:41.506
apologize for it,
there is a tendency toward

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:44.389
humanitarianism in the laws
concerning slavery.

00:40:44.389 --> 00:40:46.820
The Bible is equivocating on
this institution.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.253
In some societies,
in their legal systems,

00:40:49.253 --> 00:40:52.697
it's clear that slaves are the
chattel, the property of the

00:40:52.697 --> 00:40:54.181
master.
The Bible, again,

00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:55.650
equivocates on this question.
 

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.540
They affirm some personal
rights for the slave,

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.418
but not all.
In contrast to,

00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.879
for example,
the middle Assyrian laws,

00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:06.139
where a master can kill a slave
with impunity,

00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:09.175
the Bible legislates that the
master who wounds his slave in

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:11.953
any way, even losing a
tooth--which is understood to be

00:41:11.953 --> 00:41:14.198
a minor thing,
because it's not in any way an

00:41:14.198 --> 00:41:16.440
essential organ--so even if he
knocks out a tooth,

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.730
right, he has to set him free.
 

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.199
That's in Exodus 21:26-27.
 

00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:25.271
Moreover, the slave is entitled
to the Sabbath rest and all of

00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:26.579
the Sabbath legislation.
 

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:30.045
And quite importantly,
a fugitive slave cannot be

00:41:30.045 --> 00:41:31.850
returned to his master.
 

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:36.476
That's in Deuteronomy 23:16-17:
You shall not turn over

00:41:36.476 --> 00:41:39.920
to his master a slave who seeks
refuge with you from his master.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.494
He shall live with you in any
place he may choose among the

00:41:42.494 --> 00:41:44.670
settlements in your midst,
wherever he pleases;

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.250
you must not ill treat
him.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.753
This is the opposite of the
fugitive slave law,

00:41:48.753 --> 00:41:51.474
actually in this country in the
nineteenth century,

00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:53.269
but also in Hammurabi's Code.
 

00:41:53.269 --> 00:41:55.807
Right, Hammurabi's Code,
15,16 through 19:

00:41:55.807 --> 00:41:59.582
"If a citizen has harbored in
his house either a fugitive male

00:41:59.582 --> 00:42:03.542
or female slave belonging to the
state or private citizen and has

00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:07.070
not brought him forth at the
summons of the police,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.739
that householder shall be put
to death."

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:11.897
The term of Israelite,
Israelite slavery,

00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:14.513
that is to say an Israelite who
has fallen into service to

00:42:14.513 --> 00:42:17.780
another Israelite through,
generally, indebtedness--that's

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.135
a form that slavery took in the
ancient world and in the

00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:25.100
biblical picture--the term was
limited to six years by Exodus,

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.730
by the Covenant Code.
 

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.869
In the Priestly code,
it's prohibited altogether.

00:42:28.869 --> 00:42:31.900
No Israelite can be enslaved to
another Israelite.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.750
So it's actually done away with
as an institution altogether.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:38.387
In general, the Bible urges
humanitarian treatment of the

00:42:38.387 --> 00:42:41.051
slave, again,
'for you were once slaves in

00:42:41.051 --> 00:42:42.739
Egypt' is the refrain.
 

00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:46.269
Other evidence of the trend
towards humanitarianism is the

00:42:46.269 --> 00:42:48.869
lack of legalized violence in
the Bible.

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:50.698
Here if you compare the Middle
Assyrian laws,

00:42:50.698 --> 00:42:52.320
you'll see something quite
different.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.675
There, the middle Assyrian laws
explicitly authorize inhumane

00:42:55.675 --> 00:42:58.920
treatment of a deserting
wife--you can cut off her ears;

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.644
legalized violence in the case
of a distrainee,

00:43:01.644 --> 00:43:04.902
a distrainee is a pledge,
someone who has been placed in

00:43:04.902 --> 00:43:08.219
your house because of a debt and
is working for you.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:11.353
The citizen may do what he
wishes as he feels the

00:43:11.353 --> 00:43:12.790
distrainee deserves.
 

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.849
He may pull out his hair.
 

00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:16.090
He may mutilate his ears by
piercing them.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:20.373
The middle Assyrian laws also
legalized violence against a

00:43:20.373 --> 00:43:22.049
wife.
"When she deserves it" a

00:43:22.049 --> 00:43:25.066
seignor may pull out the hair of
his wife, mutilate or twist her

00:43:25.066 --> 00:43:27.676
ears.
There's no liability attaching

00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:29.812
to him.
Legal systems often express

00:43:29.812 --> 00:43:33.181
their values by the punishments
that are posited for various

00:43:33.181 --> 00:43:35.360
transgressions.
And here, Moshe Greenberg has

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.541
done something very interesting,
a little controversial,

00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:38.849
not everyone agrees with this.
 

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:42.045
But he's pointed out that the
Bible differs from the other

00:43:42.045 --> 00:43:45.185
extra-biblical codes in the
value that it places on human

00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:47.116
life.
And you consider the crimes

00:43:47.116 --> 00:43:50.233
that are punished by capital
punishment, and the crimes that

00:43:50.233 --> 00:43:52.400
are punished by monetary
compensation,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.360
and he feels this is quite
revealing.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.216
So I've put this very handy
little chart on the board for

00:43:58.216 --> 00:44:00.420
you listing codes on one side.
 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.044
And you'll see the kinds of
things that are punished by

00:44:03.044 --> 00:44:04.599
monetary fine or compensation.
 

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:08.334
In the Hittite laws,
homicide--you pay a certain

00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:11.989
amount of money to compensate
for the death.

00:44:11.989 --> 00:44:13.849
Personal injury,
bodily injury,

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:16.079
you pay a certain amount of
money.

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:18.895
In the middle Assyrian laws
also, homicide--it's up to the

00:44:18.895 --> 00:44:20.619
family.
They can decide how they want

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:22.650
this to be punished,
but they can take money.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.888
Code of Hammurabi,
we only have an accidental

00:44:24.888 --> 00:44:27.024
homicide case,
we don't have an intentional

00:44:27.024 --> 00:44:28.764
homicide case,
so we don't know,

00:44:28.764 --> 00:44:30.800
but bodily injury when it's
between equals,

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.079
then the principle of
talion applies.

00:44:33.079 --> 00:44:36.550
But when it's not between
equals, monetary payment and so

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.494
on.
Death, on the other hand,

00:44:38.494 --> 00:44:42.090
is the punishment for certain
property crimes instead of

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.639
personal injury and homicide
crimes.

00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:50.889
Death for theft in the Hittite
laws and for bestiality.

00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:54.079
In the middle Assyrian laws,
also theft and in the Code of

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.869
Hammurabi, theft and cheating.
 

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:58.570
I'll go over some of these in a
little more detail.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.916
So Greenberg is going to argue
that the Bible reverses the view

00:45:01.916 --> 00:45:04.357
of the other codes,
he says, because in those,

00:45:04.357 --> 00:45:06.619
life is cheap and property is
highly valued.

00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:09.370
So Hammurabi's Code imposes the
death penalty for the theft of

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.670
property, for assisting in the
escape of a slave,

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.533
which is its master's property,
for cheating a customer over

00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:15.650
the price of a drink.
 

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.852
Middle Assyrian Laws:
there's death to a wife if she

00:45:18.852 --> 00:45:22.432
steals from her husband and
death to any who purchased the

00:45:22.432 --> 00:45:25.177
stolen goods.
The Bible never imposes the

00:45:25.177 --> 00:45:28.656
death penalty for violations of
property rights--personal

00:45:28.656 --> 00:45:31.389
property rights,
private property rights.

00:45:31.389 --> 00:45:34.946
Only for intentional homicide,
and certain religious and

00:45:34.946 --> 00:45:37.726
sexual offenses,
which are seen to be direct

00:45:37.726 --> 00:45:40.585
offenses to God.
Greenberg argues that in so

00:45:40.585 --> 00:45:44.005
doing, the Bible is expressing
the view that the sanctity of

00:45:44.005 --> 00:45:46.730
human life is paramount in its
value system.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.995
The Bible states explicitly
that homicide is the one crime

00:45:49.995 --> 00:45:53.090
for which no monetary punishment
can be substituted.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.220
You cannot ransom the life of a
murderer.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.289
He must pay with his life.
 

00:45:57.289 --> 00:45:59.737
Numbers 35:31-34:
"You may not accept a ransom

00:45:59.737 --> 00:46:03.110
for the life of a murderer who
is guilty of a capitol crime;

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.829
he must be put to death.
 

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:08.781
Nor may you accept ransom in
lieu of flight to a city of

00:46:08.781 --> 00:46:10.767
refuge."
Remember if it's an accidental

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:13.471
homicide, there is a leniency in
the law that that person can run

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.921
to a city of refuge and remain
there until the death of the

00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:18.170
high priest.
The shedding of his blood

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.925
purges the land of "blood
guilt," if you will,

00:46:20.925 --> 00:46:23.190
because this is a religious
crime.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.566
But you can't pay money instead
of running to the city of

00:46:27.566 --> 00:46:29.333
refuge.
"You shall not pollute the land

00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:30.019
in which you live."
 

00:46:30.019 --> 00:46:31.889
There's a notion here of blood
guilt, of pollution.

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:34.578
…blood pollutes the
land, and the land can have no

00:46:34.578 --> 00:46:37.456
expiation for blood that is shed
on it, except by the blood of

00:46:37.456 --> 00:46:39.827
him who shed it.
You shall not defile the land

00:46:39.827 --> 00:46:41.894
in which you live,
in which I myself abide,

00:46:41.894 --> 00:46:44.699
for I the Lord abide among the
Israelite people.

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:47.601
And outside the Bible,
we really don't have that

00:46:47.601 --> 00:46:50.750
absolute ban on monetary
compensation for murder.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:54.176
Greenberg has argued that for
the biblical legislators,

00:46:54.176 --> 00:46:57.539
human life and property are
simply incommensurable.

00:46:57.539 --> 00:47:01.694
Crimes in the one realm cannot
be compensated by punishment in

00:47:01.694 --> 00:47:04.340
the other realm.
A crime in the realm of

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.170
life/personal injury has to be
compensated in the same realm.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.949
In the same way property crimes
are not punished by death.

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:13.623
Also in the bible there's no,
what I call,

00:47:13.623 --> 00:47:14.480
literal punishment.
 

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.527
You'll sometimes see people
refer to this as vicarious

00:47:16.527 --> 00:47:18.108
punishment.
I don't think it's vicarious

00:47:18.108 --> 00:47:20.119
punishment.
I call it literal punishment.

00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:22.748
Literal punishment:
for example,

00:47:22.748 --> 00:47:27.074
in the Code of Hammurabi,
where someone's ox kills a

00:47:27.074 --> 00:47:31.060
child, then the ox owner's child
is killed.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.670
That's not vicarious.
 

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.850
You're not substituting.
 

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.530
It's literal.
The legal subject is the father;

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:38.880
he has lost a child.
 

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.423
So I have to suffer the literal
punishment, as a father,

00:47:41.423 --> 00:47:42.533
I have to lose my child.
 

00:47:42.533 --> 00:47:43.639
Right?
It's not a substitution;

00:47:43.639 --> 00:47:45.980
it's a literal punishment for
what you did to the other.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.280
And the Bible explicitly
rejects that idea.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.803
In Exodus 21,
it explicitly says that the

00:47:50.803 --> 00:47:54.400
owner's child is not to be put
to death, is not killed.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.674
Deuteronomy 24:16 states that,
"Parents shall not be put to

00:47:57.674 --> 00:48:00.279
death for children,
nor children be put to death

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:02.711
for their parents:
a person shall be put to death

00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.079
only for his own crime."
 

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:07.090
The equal value of human life
and limb is also protected by

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.050
the principle of talion
that we discussed above.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.934
In the Code of Hammurabi,
an aristocrat can simply pay

00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:14.730
money for injuring an inferior.
 

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.794
That's not going to be much of
a hardship to a wealthy person,

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:20.758
and it certainly reflects the
low value that's placed on the

00:48:20.758 --> 00:48:23.219
life and limb of a member of the
lower class.

00:48:23.219 --> 00:48:26.372
Talion only applies
between social equals in the

00:48:26.372 --> 00:48:27.539
Code of Hammurabi.
 

00:48:27.539 --> 00:48:29.979
In the Bible,
the extension of talion

00:48:29.979 --> 00:48:32.249
to all free persons,
regardless of class,

00:48:32.249 --> 00:48:35.710
expresses the notion that all
persons are of equal value.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.736
In the case of rape,
the rapist's wife is not raped,

00:48:38.736 --> 00:48:41.170
as happens in the middle
Assyrian laws.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.059
Again, a literal punishment.
 

00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:45.850
Other biblical values are
reflected in the emphasis on

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.219
laws that deal with the plight
of the poor,

00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:51.021
the slave, the alien,
the rights and dignity of

00:48:51.021 --> 00:48:52.239
debtors and so on.
 

00:48:52.239 --> 00:48:54.360
I've reached just about the end
of my time.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.085
Just one last statement,
because I don't want to leave

00:48:57.085 --> 00:49:00.222
you with the impression that the
biblical materials speak with

00:49:00.222 --> 00:49:01.559
one voice--they don't.
 

00:49:01.559 --> 00:49:08.570
I mean, Greenberg has tried to
pull out some common values.

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.083
Biblical legal materials
contain provisions that

00:49:11.083 --> 00:49:12.420
contradict one another.
 

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.312
Later versions of the law,
particularly in D for example,

00:49:15.312 --> 00:49:18.050
will update and revise earlier
versions of the law.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.607
Leviticus takes issue with the
whole institution of Israelite

00:49:20.607 --> 00:49:23.164
slavery that's accepted in the
covenant quoted in Deuteronomy

00:49:23.164 --> 00:49:24.869
and says just no,
that can't happen.

00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:27.329
All Israelites are servants of
God;

00:49:27.329 --> 00:49:29.449
none of you can be servants to
another.

00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:32.800
So in these laws--there is
contradiction.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.199
Nevertheless,
I think what Greenberg is

00:49:35.199 --> 00:49:38.609
trying to say is that it is
still fair--even though the

00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:41.639
materials contain
contradictions--it's still fair

00:49:41.639 --> 00:49:44.860
to say that they sound certain
common themes.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.708
They express certain important
principles and values,

00:49:47.708 --> 00:49:50.064
which include:
the supreme sanctity of human

00:49:50.064 --> 00:49:53.570
life: that's pretty consistently
maintained among the codes;

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.592
the value of persons over
property: pretty consistently

00:49:56.592 --> 00:49:58.973
maintained;
the equality of all free

00:49:58.973 --> 00:50:02.349
persons before the law:
consistently maintained;

00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:05.310
the importance of assisting the
disadvantaged in society:

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.309
very consistently maintained;
the integration and the

00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:11.915
interdependence of all aspects
of human life all coming within

00:50:11.915 --> 00:50:15.579
the will of God to legislate:
very consistently maintained.

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.083
When we come back on Monday,
I just want to say a little bit

00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:20.672
about the narrative context in
which the laws are found before

00:50:20.672 --> 00:50:22.030
we move on into Deuteronomy.
 

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.793
Monday evening will be the time
at which the midterm exam will

00:50:25.793 --> 00:50:28.877
be posted on the website,
and that'll be at 6:00 pm

00:50:28.877 --> 00:50:31.824
Monday evening.
You'll have a 24-hour period of

00:50:31.824 --> 00:50:35.429
time in which to find--I forget
what I said--30 or 40 minutes?

00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:36.610
It'll be clear on the
instructions.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.963
To just sit and treat it as if
you're in an in-class exam

00:50:39.963 --> 00:50:42.000
situation, and write your essay.

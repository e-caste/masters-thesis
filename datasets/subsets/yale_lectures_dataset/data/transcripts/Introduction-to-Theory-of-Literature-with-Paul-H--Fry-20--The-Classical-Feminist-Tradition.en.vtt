00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.200
Prof: This lecture,
I think, starts with a series

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.520
of preliminaries.
 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.524
The technical term for
preliminaries of this kind in

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:13.900
literary study is
"prolepsis"--

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.870
that is to say,
the form of anticipation which,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.607
in a certain sense,
covers what will be talked

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:21.770
about later.
 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.190
They are prolepses of this kind.
 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.756
First, I wanted to say that in
entering upon the phase of this

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:35.957
course which concerns a series
of particular identities as

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:38.736
perspectives,
as points of departure,

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:41.010
we're still thinking about the
literary text;

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.981
and, of course,
in thinking about identity

00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:50.593
itself,
we come upon a form of critical

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:55.657
endeavor which is,
in practical terms,

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:59.140
incredibly rich and productive.
 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.688
It is simply amazing how,
as Jonathan Culler once put it,

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:08.113
"reading as a woman,"
or reading as an

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:12.897
African-American,
or reading as any of the other

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:19.110
sort of identity that we're
going to be talking about--

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.900
it's simply amazing how this
kind of reading,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.090
if it's done alertly,
transforms everything.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.165
That is to say,
it has an incredible practical

00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:31.180
payoff.
 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.250
Last time in the context of the
New Historicism,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.391
Stephen Greenblatt's brilliant
anecdote begins with Queen

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.732
Elizabeth saying,
"I am Richard II,

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:44.849
know you not that?"
 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:49.013
Well, Stephen Greenblatt isn't
concerned with investigating a

00:01:49.013 --> 00:01:52.968
pronouncement of that sort from
the standpoint of feminist

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:55.927
criticism,
or indeed from the standpoint

00:01:55.927 --> 00:01:58.769
of something we'll be taking up
later on--

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.006
gender theory;
but still, it's rather an

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:04.831
amazing thing for Queen
Elizabeth to say,

00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:05.680
isn't it?
 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.530
It suggests really that it's,
after all,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.973
remarkable that she,
a woman, would find herself in

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:20.394
a position not so much needing
to endure the kind of suffering

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:25.905
and peril that her own sex has
traditionally endured but rather

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:30.526
potentially enduring the
suffering and peril that one

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:35.770
would experience in the
masculine gender position,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.311
made perhaps even more
interesting and complicated by

00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:43.397
the fact that Elizabeth knows
perfectly well that despite the

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:47.740
rarity of her being Richard II,
it's nevertheless not a unique

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.370
position.
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.090
She has subjected
&gt;

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.190
Mary Queen of Scots to
precisely that position.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.121
She has deposed and beheaded
her, ultimately,

00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:04.391
in just the way that she fears
the Earl of Essex will depose

00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.090
and behead her.
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.908
So the way in which this
remark, "I am Richard II,

00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:15.753
know you not that?"--so
easily commandeered and made use

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:19.710
of from the standpoint of the
New Historicism--

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.014
can come to life in a
completely different way when we

00:03:24.014 --> 00:03:28.889
think about it as a question of
a gendered experience is,

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.080
I think, in itself a
fascinating one.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.027
Now at the end of the last
lecture, by way of further

00:03:37.027 --> 00:03:40.360
preliminary, I told a little
fib.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.979
I said that there were no women
in Tony the Tow Truck,

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.318
and of course in your prose
text of it--

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:50.179
the one that you've been
clutching to your bosom

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.300
feverishly for the entire
semester--

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.129
there are no women.
 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.479
There are just guys talking.
 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.408
However, if to the prose text,
and I've told you about these,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.556
you add the illustrations--this
[gestures to board]

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.801
is one of them,
roughly speaking,

00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:10.348
and I did it from memory--
if you add the illustrations,

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:13.538
you'll have to realize that
it's not just the cars.

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:16.899
You see the little smiles on
the faces of the houses there:

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.547
it's not just the cars that are
happy about what's going on when

00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:23.269
Bumpy finally comes along and
pushes Tony,

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:28.336
but it's the houses in the
background which have been

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:34.281
expressing disapproval at the
reactions of Neato and Speedy to

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:36.230
the predicament.
 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.834
There are big frowns on the
faces of those houses in those

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:40.910
illustrations,
 

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:46.459
houses that now express beaming
approval when the morally

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.709
correct thing is done.
 

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.523
Now in the Victorian
period--and in a certain sense I

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:54.661
think Tony the Tow Truck
in this regard harkens back

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:59.060
to the Victorian period--
there was a poet named Coventry

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.346
Patmore who,
actually a rather good poet,

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:05.725
became notorious,
however, in the feminist

00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:10.851
tradition for having written a
long poem in which he describes

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:14.800
woman as "the angel in the
house."

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.750
You're probably familiar with
that expression,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.620
and it's an idea which is also,
I think,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.009
embodied in a monumental book
of some twenty-five years ago by

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.536
Ann Douglas called The
Feminization of American

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:32.939
Culture.
The idea is that moral and

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:40.031
aesthetic and cultural values
are somehow or another in the

00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.800
hands of women in the drawing
room,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.435
at the tea table,
dictating to the

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:53.966
agencies of society--
all of which are strictly male

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:58.182
prerogatives--
what a proper ethical sense of

00:05:58.182 --> 00:06:00.250
things ought to be.
 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.514
In other words,
the role of the angel in the

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:05.463
house is not just to wash the
dishes and take care of the

00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:07.730
kids, although that's a big part
of it.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.072
The role of the angel in the
house is also to adjudicate the

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:17.240
moral aspect of life at the
domestic level,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.720
and that's exactly what these
houses,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.771
obviously inhabited by
angels--how else could they be

00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.103
smiling and frowning?--
that's what these houses are

00:06:29.103 --> 00:06:29.819
doing.
 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.291
So it is the case after all
that there are women in Tony

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.867
the Tow Truck.
All right.

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:40.887
Now, as I say,
this moment is not exactly a

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:43.759
crossroads in our syllabus.
 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.494
It's not like moving from
language to the psyche to the

00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:51.920
social, because obviously we're
still very much in the social.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.279
In fact, it's not even as
though we haven't hitherto

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:59.699
encountered the notion of
perspective.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.019
Obviously, we have in all sorts
of ways,

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:06.470
but particularly in the work of
Bakhtin or Jameson,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.620
we're introduced to the way in
which class conflict--

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.149
that is to say,
being of a certain class,

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:18.233
therefore having an
identity--gets itself expressed

00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:24.435
in literary form dialogically
and gets itself expressed either

00:07:24.435 --> 00:07:30.636
as the expression of conflict
between or among classes or as a

00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:35.237
more cacophonous and yet,
at the same time,

00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:39.516
very frequently harmonious
chorus of voices of the sort

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:41.309
that--
in notions of

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:45.709
"carnivalization"
and other such notions--

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:47.720
one finds in Bakhtin.
 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.031
In other words,
the way in which the language

00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:54.125
of a text,
the language of a narrative or

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:57.440
of a poem or of a play gets
itself expressed,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.560
is already, as we have
encountered it,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.379
a question of perspective.
 

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:06.839
That is to say,
it needs to be read with

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:11.189
notions of identity,
in this case notions of class

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:15.360
identity, in mind if it's to be
understood.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.689
Well, what's also interesting,
though,

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:22.935
about turning to questions of
identity is that perhaps more

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:26.639
sharply now than hitherto--
although I have been at pains

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.074
to point out certain moments in
the syllabus in which one really

00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:34.424
does arrive at a crossroads,
and you simply can't take both

00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:36.347
paths--
nevertheless,

00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:42.110
within the context of thinking
about identity in these ways as

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.621
literary theory,
we begin to feel an increased

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:50.509
competitiveness among
perspectives.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:54.389
I'm going to be pointing this
out from time to time in the

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:57.519
sequence of lectures that we now
undertake,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:03.200
but from the very beginning
there is a sense of actually a

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.178
competition which is in some
ways unresolved to this day--

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.315
for example,
between the feminist and the

00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:14.038
Marxist perspective.
 

00:09:14.038 --> 00:09:18.043
That is to say:
what is the underlying

00:09:18.043 --> 00:09:23.019
determination of identity and
consciousness?

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:28.820
Is it class or gender,
just for example?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.460
This is not a new topic.
 

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.062
This isn't a topic that we
stumble on today as a result of

00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:38.860
some belated sophistication we
have achieved.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.480
Listen to Virginia Woolf on
page 600 of A Room of One's

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.940
Own where she says,
top of the left-hand column:

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.769
For genius like Shakespeare's
is not born among labouring,

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:53.720
uneducated, servile people.
 

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.227
It was not born in England
among the Saxons and the

00:09:56.227 --> 00:09:56.730
Britons.
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.980
It is not born today among the
working classes.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.804
How, then, could it have been
born among women whose work

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.544
began,
according to Professor

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:08.408
Trevelyan, almost before they
were out of the nursery,

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:12.884
who were forced to it by their
parents and held to it by all

00:10:12.884 --> 00:10:15.158
the power of law and custom?
 

00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:20.083
Yet genius of a sort must have
existed among women as it must

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:23.450
have existed among the working
classes.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.841
Now in a way,
Woolf is pulling her punches

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:26.250
here.
 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.570
She is not saying class has
priority over gender,

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.149
nor is she saying gender has
priority over class,

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:38.601
if we're to understand the
history of the oppression of

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:43.303
women or the history of the
limits on the forms of women's

00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:44.538
expression.
 

00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:47.687
She's pulling her punches,
and yet at the same time I

00:10:47.687 --> 00:10:51.500
think we can see a point of view
in Woolf's Room of One's Own

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.970
which is,
after all, rather surprising.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.200
Think of the title.
 

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.177
Think of the later title of a
tract in some ways similar about

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:05.586
the possible scope for
contemporary activity for women,

00:11:05.586 --> 00:11:07.298
Three Guineas.
 

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:11.460
These titles are grounded
in material circumstances.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:17.227
Woolf stands before her
audience, her Oxbridge audience

00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:20.629
of women,
and says all she really has to

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:24.514
say is just this one thing:
if you're going to expect to

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:28.681
get anything done in the way of
writing or in the way of any

00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:32.706
other activity that's genuinely
independent of patriarchal

00:11:32.706 --> 00:11:36.101
limitation,
you've really got to have 500

00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:38.788
pounds a year and a room of your
own.

00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:41.928
That's all she really says she
has to say.

00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:45.722
In fact, as you read through
the six chapters of A Room of

00:11:45.722 --> 00:11:48.190
One's Own, you find
that,

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.878
as if on an elastic band after
the extraordinary range of

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:57.399
impressionist thinking that each
chapter manifests,

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:00.490
she is pulled back to this one
particular--

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.799
as she sees it--necessary
practical precondition,

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.960
a material precondition.
 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.889
If you want to get anything
done--you're not Jane Austen,

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:14.817
you're not a genius sitting in
your parlor whisking your

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:19.172
novel-in-progress under a piece
of blotting paper every time a

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:23.796
servant comes in to the room,
you're not like that--you

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:28.190
really do need today the
independence of having 500

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.090
pounds and a room of your own.
 

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.755
In other words,
I think one could show that

00:12:33.755 --> 00:12:36.168
even in A Room of One's
Own--

00:12:36.168 --> 00:12:41.014
which is, if not the greatest,
certainly the most eloquent

00:12:41.014 --> 00:12:45.519
feminist treatise on the
conditions of women's writing

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:48.991
ever written--
one could show that even in

00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:52.230
that, there is a certain
priority given to the

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.879
perspective of class,
as opposed to the perspective

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:57.960
of gender.
 

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:04.046
Gender will continue to be
conditioned by the effects of

00:13:04.046 --> 00:13:09.690
money and power if in fact
something isn't done--

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:14.158
let's face it--to redistribute
money and power.

00:13:14.158 --> 00:13:15.820
This is a perspective which,
by the way,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.797
is even clearer in Three
Guineas and suggests that

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:26.677
despite its main agenda,
which is a feminist one--that

00:13:26.677 --> 00:13:30.740
underlying that there is a sense
of the priority of class.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.383
These sorts of tensions
continue to haunt not just

00:13:34.383 --> 00:13:37.876
feminist criticism,
but other forms of criticism

00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:41.990
having to do with other forms of
identity really to this day.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.303
Conferences featuring a variety
of identity perspectives very

00:13:47.303 --> 00:13:52.440
typically develop into debates
on precisely this issue,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.774
and the one-ups-persons of
conferences of this kind are

00:13:56.774 --> 00:14:01.590
always the ones who somehow get
in the last word and say,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.139
"You're all naļve.
 

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:05.879
You suppose that this is the
basic issue,

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:09.240
but there's an underlying issue
which is the basic issue,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.909
and that's the one that,
I'm going to demonstrate,

00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:13.889
must absolutely prevail."
 

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:18.139
It's not necessarily always the
Marxist card which is played in

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.019
this context,
although it frequently is.

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:24.399
It could be some other card,
but it's always a card played.

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.605
It's always the last word at
the conference which makes

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:28.159
everybody go away and say,
"Oh.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.009
I thought this was about women.
 

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:30.730
Oh, dear.
 

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.639
It must be about something
else."

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:38.918
We will have to come back to
that because in a way,

00:14:38.918 --> 00:14:43.807
the material we cover today and
the way that we're enabled to

00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:48.937
discuss it by its own nature is
something that calls for another

00:14:48.937 --> 00:14:53.500
lecture and a lecture that we
will actually provide.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.077
There's a very real sense,
as I hope to show by the end of

00:14:57.077 --> 00:14:59.831
the lecture,
in which traditional--I call

00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:02.940
this "classical feminist
criticism"--

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.908
in which traditional or
classical feminist criticism

00:15:05.908 --> 00:15:10.488
needs to be supplemented,
perhaps in the Derridean sense,

00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:15.480
by something more,
which is gender theory.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.881
As I say, at the end of the
lecture I'll try to explain what

00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.918
that might entail,
and then come back to it when

00:15:23.918 --> 00:15:28.857
we discuss Judith Butler and
Michel Foucault a few lectures

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:29.879
from now.
 

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:30.666
All right.
 

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:34.832
So A Room of One's Own
is an absolutely amazing

00:15:34.832 --> 00:15:36.720
tour de force.
 

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.548
It's actually one of my
favorite books.

00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:43.678
I read it like a novel,
and in many ways it is a novel.

00:15:43.678 --> 00:15:48.057
I think immediately that that
might give us pause because if

00:15:48.057 --> 00:15:51.620
Charlotte Brontė
is to be called to task for

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.212
tendentiousness--
that is to say,

00:15:54.212 --> 00:15:57.450
for writing from the standpoint
of complaint,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.561
of perceived oppression;
and if Charlotte Brontė's

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.144
tendentiousness gets in the way
of the full expression of what

00:16:05.144 --> 00:16:07.307
she has to say--
which is to say,

00:16:07.307 --> 00:16:10.418
the unfolding of a novel;
and if as Virginia Woolf,

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:12.450
I think, actually rightly
remarks,

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.220
at least from an aesthetic
point of view,

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.712
we wonder why on earth Grace
Pool suddenly appears after

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:23.125
Jane's diatribe about wishing
that she could travel and

00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:27.210
wishing that her horizons had
been broadened,

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.019
that somehow,
Virginia Woolf says,

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:34.788
Grace Pool is out of place and
there's been a rift in the

00:16:34.788 --> 00:16:38.789
narrative fabric:
if this criticism of Charlotte

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:42.769
Brontė is fair,
and we'll be coming back to it

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:45.947
in other contexts,
then of course it could be

00:16:45.947 --> 00:16:49.668
turned against the choice of
narrative style,

00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:52.599
of narrative approach,
in A Room of One's Own

00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:53.408
itself.
 

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:55.535
This, I suppose,
could only strike you

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:59.100
forcefully if you read the whole
of A Room of One's Own,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.370
all six chapters,
which I urge you to do because

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.590
it's so much fun.
 

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.076
If you read the whole of A
Room of One's Own,

00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:06.118
you'd say,
"Well, gee.

00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:07.769
This is sort of a novel,
too."

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:11.374
The speaker says, "Oh,
call me anybody you like,"

00:17:11.374 --> 00:17:13.720
not unlike Melville's speaker
saying,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.819
"Call me Ishmael."
 

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.118
You can call me Mary Beton.
 

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.700
You can call me Mary Seton,
call me Mary Carmichael.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.593
It doesn't really matter,
but I've had certain

00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:22.430
adventures.
 

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.105
At least that person speaking
has had certain adventures which

00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:29.130
are fictitious,
or at least I reserve the right

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.009
to have you suppose that they
are fictitious.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.655
In other words,
this is a narrative that moves

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:39.058
quite by design in the world of
fiction.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.826
In other words,
Virginia Woolf is saying it

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:43.705
really isn't true,
as she tells us in the first

00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:45.776
chapter,
that she, Mary Beton,

00:17:45.776 --> 00:17:48.230
after sitting at the river
thinking,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.722
wondering what on earth she's
going to tell these young ladies

00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:55.005
about women and fiction--
as she's been thinking about

00:17:55.005 --> 00:17:57.358
that, finally she gets a little
idea.

00:17:57.358 --> 00:17:59.588
It's like pulling a bit of a
fish out of the river,

00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:01.818
and the fish starts swimming
around in her head.

00:18:01.818 --> 00:18:05.798
She becomes quite excited and
she walks away across the grass.

00:18:05.798 --> 00:18:10.387
At that point up arises a
beadle, a formidable person

00:18:10.387 --> 00:18:14.976
wearing Oxonian gowns and
pointing at the gravel path

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:18.471
where she,
as an unauthorized woman,

00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:22.557
should be walking,
as the grass is the province

00:18:22.557 --> 00:18:26.328
only for the men enrolled in the
university;

00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:30.538
and then she has repeated
encounters of that kind.

00:18:30.538 --> 00:18:32.960
She goes to the library
unthinkingly,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.605
only to be told by an elderly
wraithlike gentleman that since

00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:42.328
she's a woman she needs a letter
of introduction to get in.

00:18:42.328 --> 00:18:45.570
And so her day,
her fictitious day of thinking

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.893
about what on earth she should
say to these young women about

00:18:49.893 --> 00:18:53.176
women and fiction,
begins, somewhat unpleasantly

00:18:53.176 --> 00:18:57.328
for her character,
as a presented fiction.

00:18:57.328 --> 00:18:59.519
In other words,
A Room of One's Own is,

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:00.588
in a sense, a novel.
 

00:19:00.588 --> 00:19:05.130
It continues with a very
pleasant lunch that she has.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.781
She's been invited to the
campus as a distinguished

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:09.440
writer.
 

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:17.313
It's okay to be a woman who is
a novelist as long as you don't

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:20.538
rock the boat too much.
 

00:19:20.538 --> 00:19:23.500
In that regard,
she can have been invited to

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.220
such a lunch and has a very
pleasant lunch because it's

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.558
provided by men in an atmosphere
which is designed for men.

00:19:31.558 --> 00:19:35.923
Then she goes to visit a friend
who is teaching at this

00:19:35.923 --> 00:19:37.618
fictitious college.
 

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:41.019
She has dinner with the friend
in that college's dining hall,

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:45.548
and the dinner is extremely
inferior and plain,

00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:49.404
and then they go to her rooms
and they start talking about the

00:19:49.404 --> 00:19:52.250
conditions in which this college
was built.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.290
A bunch of women in the
nineteenth century did all they

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.009
could do to raise 30,000 pounds,
no frills, thank you very much.

00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:00.180
None of them had any money.
 

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.368
There were no major donations
and so the grass never gets cut,

00:20:04.368 --> 00:20:09.650
the brick is plain and
unadorned, and that's the way

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.308
life is in this particular
women's college.

00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:18.142
The next day she goes to the
library because she decides

00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:21.974
she's really got to find out
something about what people

00:20:21.974 --> 00:20:25.808
think of women;
and so, what is a woman?

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.664
I don't know so I'd better look
it up in the library,

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:29.380
she thinks.
 

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.349
She finds out that hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of men

00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:37.588
have written books about women:
on the inferiority of women,

00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:41.530
the moral sensitivity of women,
the lack of physical strength

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.640
of women,
on and on and on.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.054
She lists them as items in the
library catalog which actually

00:20:47.054 --> 00:20:48.990
are there &gt;
 

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.955
in the library catalog--all of
them, of course,

00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:55.888
getting themselves expressed in
these hundreds and hundreds of

00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:57.759
books about women by men.
 

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:59.380
Well, this is very frustrating
but,

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.574
as you can imagine,
it's an occasion for wonderful

00:21:03.574 --> 00:21:06.981
satire--
one has to say tendentious

00:21:06.981 --> 00:21:11.400
satire, because obviously it's
male-bashing.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.432
My point is that she wouldn't
let Charlotte Brontė

00:21:15.432 --> 00:21:17.000
get away with that.
 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.386
Charlotte Brontė
has to suspend her anger,

00:21:21.386 --> 00:21:27.015
Virginia Woolf wants to say,
if she's going to get the whole

00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:30.450
of what's on her mind expressed.
 

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.249
Well, Virginia Woolf,
who sort of doesn't sound very

00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:37.339
angry,
but you could well be mistaken

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:40.636
about that--
she's venting her anger in

00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:43.891
comic effects--
Virginia Woolf allows herself,

00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:46.450
because that really is
the case,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.640
a measure of anger.
 

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.538
So it is in that chapter.
 

00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:53.173
Then she goes home and the rest
of A Room of One's Own

00:21:53.173 --> 00:21:55.118
takes place in her home.
 

00:21:55.118 --> 00:21:58.759
She's in her study pulling
books off the shelf of her

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:02.259
library, and this is more or
less chronological.

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:05.996
It starts with a time when she
looks on the shelf where the

00:22:05.996 --> 00:22:10.118
women writers ought to be and
there aren't any women writers,

00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:13.700
and then later,
yes, there are women writers,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.868
there are quite a few novelists.
 

00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:18.808
Then later in the twentieth
century,

00:22:18.808 --> 00:22:22.028
women writers get a little bit
more scope for their activity,

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:24.788
and as she passes all of this
in review,

00:22:24.788 --> 00:22:28.704
we continue to get her
reflections on the state of

00:22:28.704 --> 00:22:32.940
literary possibility for women
in literary history.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.876
That's the structure of A
Room of One's Own overall

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:43.930
and it is within this structure,
which is an impressionistic and

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.508
narrative,
undoubtedly novelistic

00:22:46.508 --> 00:22:49.068
structure--there are precedents
for it.

00:22:49.068 --> 00:22:50.945
Oscar Wilde's Portrait of
Mr.

00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:51.067
W.
 

00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:51.368
H.
 

00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:57.509
is one in particular--and
which is,

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:00.960
in a way, itself what it's
talking about:

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.415
It is a novella,
and in the context of the

00:23:04.415 --> 00:23:08.196
novella, as I say,
there's a certain tension or

00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:13.267
contradiction in an author who
is allowing herself tendentious

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:18.253
opinions while denying the right
to have such opinions on the

00:23:18.253 --> 00:23:21.328
part of one of her predecessors.
 

00:23:21.328 --> 00:23:24.847
As you can imagine,
what she says about Charlotte

00:23:24.847 --> 00:23:28.292
Brontė has been
controversial in subsequent

00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:29.980
feminist criticism.
 

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.473
There are a number of ways in
which feminist critics feel that

00:23:34.473 --> 00:23:38.526
Virginia Woolf is misguided or
needs to be supplemented,

00:23:38.526 --> 00:23:40.588
and this is one of them.
 

00:23:40.588 --> 00:23:43.272
By and large,
feminist critics feel that

00:23:43.272 --> 00:23:46.163
Charlotte Brontė,
or any other writer,

00:23:46.163 --> 00:23:48.640
has the right to be
tendentious.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.008
We'll have more to say about
Virginia Woolf's criterion of

00:23:54.008 --> 00:23:58.529
androgyny, which is not thinking
like either sex,

00:23:58.529 --> 00:23:59.660
in part.
 

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.746
We'll come back to that,
but most feminist criticism has

00:24:04.746 --> 00:24:10.387
felt for a variety of reasons
that androgyny isn't necessarily

00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:15.938
the ideal toward which women's
prose ought to be aspiring and

00:24:15.938 --> 00:24:21.394
takes Virginia Woolf to task
therefore for having taken this

00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:24.910
view of Charlotte Brontė.
 

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:30.586
Now yes, feminist criticism has
taken A Room of One's Own

00:24:30.586 --> 00:24:34.048
to task in a variety of
ways,

00:24:34.048 --> 00:24:37.195
but at the same time--and I
think this is freely and

00:24:37.195 --> 00:24:40.220
handsomely acknowledged by
feminist criticism--

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.608
it is amazing--when you read
the whole text,

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:45.944
and even when you read the
excerpts that you have in your

00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:49.008
anthology--
it is amazing how completely

00:24:49.008 --> 00:24:53.750
Virginia Woolf's arguments
anticipate the subsequent course

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.019
of the history of feminist
criticism.

00:24:57.019 --> 00:25:00.500
I just want to point out a few
of the ways in which it does.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.075
As Showalter points out,
the first phase of modern

00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:10.490
feminist criticism was the kind
of work that primarily paid

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.440
attention to men's treatment of
women in fiction.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:23.160
Mary Ellmann's book of 1968
called Thinking about Women,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.640
Kate Millett's Sexual
Politics in 1970 are both

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.119
books which focus primarily on
sexist male novelists whose

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:39.695
demeaning treatment of women is
something that the feminist

00:25:39.695 --> 00:25:43.348
perspective needed to bring out.
 

00:25:43.348 --> 00:25:48.826
This criticism is superseded in
Elaine Showalter's account by

00:25:48.826 --> 00:25:51.377
what she calls,
and prefers,

00:25:51.377 --> 00:25:55.769
"gynocriticism"
or "the gynocritics."

00:25:55.769 --> 00:26:00.653
Gynocriticism is not so much
concerned with men's treatment

00:26:00.653 --> 00:26:05.621
of women in fiction as with the
place of women as writers in

00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:08.990
literary history and as
characters--

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.868
regardless of whether they are
characters in men's or women's

00:26:12.868 --> 00:26:17.848
books in their own right--
in the history of fiction.

00:26:17.848 --> 00:26:22.778
In other words,
gynocriticism turns the topic

00:26:22.778 --> 00:26:29.499
of feminist criticism in the
late sixties and early seventies

00:26:29.499 --> 00:26:35.770
from the history of oppression
by men to the history of a

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.460
women's tradition.
 

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.957
Now this sense of the unfolding
of things, it seems to me,

00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:47.430
is already fully present in
Woolf.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.499
She, too, wants to talk about
the possibilities for women

00:26:51.499 --> 00:26:55.351
writers, about the need for
women writers to feel that

00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.950
they're not alone.
 

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.009
Above all at the same time,
however,

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:07.752
she frames this emphasis on the
woman's perspective with the

00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:12.111
sort of trenchant,
frequently satirical

00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:16.595
observations about men's
treatment of women and men's way

00:27:16.595 --> 00:27:21.000
of demeaning women and keeping
them in their place--

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.340
as, for example,
all the men,

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.700
most of them professors,
who wrote books about women,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.700
as she discovered in the
British library,

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.150
do.
 

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.933
All of this is very much in the
tradition of that first phase of

00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:39.578
feminist criticism that
Showalter identifies with

00:27:39.578 --> 00:27:43.680
Ellmann and Millett and others
of that generation.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:49.022
So the capaciousness of Woolf's
approach in one sense can be

00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:54.277
understood as precisely her
ability to bridge both sorts of

00:27:54.277 --> 00:27:58.584
modern tradition--
no longer chronological as

00:27:58.584 --> 00:28:01.700
Showalter presents them as
being,

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:08.256
correctly--but rather as a kind
of simultaneity in which the

00:28:08.256 --> 00:28:13.701
emphasis on men's
marginalization of women and the

00:28:13.701 --> 00:28:19.368
emphasis on women's
consciousness and traditions can

00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:23.368
be set forth at the same time.
 

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:27.328
Now also in Virginia Woolf
there is what--

00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:31.382
Since the publication of the
fascinating book by Sandra

00:28:31.382 --> 00:28:36.108
Gilbert and Susan Gubar called
The Madwoman in the Attic--

00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:39.808
this is also an allusion to
Jane Eyre,

00:28:39.808 --> 00:28:43.402
you remember Bertha,
the madwoman in the attic of

00:28:43.402 --> 00:28:46.895
Jane Eyre--
since the publication of

00:28:46.895 --> 00:28:51.505
The Madwoman in the Attic,
feminist criticism has

00:28:51.505 --> 00:28:55.078
talked about the madwoman
thesis: the idea,

00:28:55.078 --> 00:28:58.607
in other words,
that because they could not

00:28:58.607 --> 00:29:02.977
openly express themselves
creatively as writers or as

00:29:02.977 --> 00:29:07.577
artists of other kinds,
women were forced to channel

00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.390
their creativity into
subversive,

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.788
devious and perhaps
psychologically self-destructive

00:29:13.788 --> 00:29:15.459
forms,
as in, for example,

00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:18.609
Charlotte Perkins Gilman's
The Yellow Wallpaper.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:29.230
You find Woolf already on page
600--

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:34.654
just actually below the passage
about class and gender that I

00:29:34.654 --> 00:29:38.301
read before--
you find her touching on this

00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:41.940
madwoman theme long before
Gilbert and Gubar.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.798
She says: When,
however, one reads of a witch

00:29:44.798 --> 00:29:48.324
being ducked,
of a woman possessed by devils,

00:29:48.324 --> 00:29:52.462
of a wise woman selling herbs,
[and then of course she adds]

00:29:52.462 --> 00:29:55.720
and even of a very remarkable
man who had a motherā€¦

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.482
There, in other words,
one strongly suspects that

00:30:00.482 --> 00:30:05.643
there is a person whose
creativity has been oppressed

00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:10.803
and unfortunately channeled in
unsocial or antisocial

00:30:10.803 --> 00:30:12.490
directions.
 

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.420
This, as I say,
is a tradition that's

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.730
sustained.
 

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:46.588
It still exists in Showalter.
 

00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:50.259
In her gynocritical
perspective--that is to say,

00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:55.828
her insistence on our
registering, chronicling,

00:30:55.828 --> 00:30:59.494
and becoming familiar as
scholars with the history of

00:30:59.494 --> 00:31:03.088
women as well as the history of
women's writing--

00:31:03.088 --> 00:31:09.038
the recognition of such forms
of repression as witchcraft,

00:31:09.038 --> 00:31:13.920
as madness, as herbalism,
as whatever it might be,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.019
need to be taken into account.
 

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:20.690
Also very much on the mind of
Woolf already,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.971
as it still is particularly for
Showalter because this is

00:31:23.971 --> 00:31:27.368
Showalter's understanding of the
task of gynocriticism,

00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:31.098
is the notion that one needs a
tradition,

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:34.910
that one of the great
difficulties and shortcomings

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.730
facing the woman's writer is
that,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.223
yes, there are a few
greats--the same ones always

00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:44.166
named,
Austen, the Brontės,

00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:47.490
George Eliot--
but there is not a sense of an

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.779
ongoing tradition,
of a developing tradition

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:56.602
within which one could write;
so that Woolf on page 606,

00:31:56.602 --> 00:32:02.557
the right-hand column,
talks about "the man's

00:32:02.557 --> 00:32:06.894
sentence,"
the difficulty of coming to

00:32:06.894 --> 00:32:12.038
terms with not having,
not just a room of one's own,

00:32:12.038 --> 00:32:14.500
but a language of one's own.
 

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.602
This is toward the top of the
right-hand column:

00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:18.750
"Perhaps the first thing
she would find,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.808
setting pen to paper,
was that there was no common

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:25.710
sentence ready for her
use."

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:31.096
All the literary models,
all the models of novelistic

00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:34.413
prose--most of them,
in any case,

00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:38.605
are engendered male;
because the atmosphere of

00:32:38.605 --> 00:32:42.769
writing--and this is a point
that we'll be getting to soon--

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:47.067
the very fact of writing is
something that we have to

00:32:47.067 --> 00:32:50.538
understand as having a male
stamp on it.

00:32:50.538 --> 00:32:52.578
Further down in the right-hand
column:

00:32:52.578 --> 00:32:57.529
That is a man's sentence [she's
just quoted a long sentence];

00:32:57.529 --> 00:33:00.970
behind it one can see Johnson,
Gibbon and the rest."

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.220
It was a sentence that was
unsuited for a woman's use.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.519
Charlotte Brontė,
with all her splendid gift for

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:11.578
prose, stumbled and fell with
that clumsy weapon in her hands.

00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:14.557
George Eliot committed
atrocities with it that beggar

00:33:14.557 --> 00:33:15.358
description.
 

00:33:15.358 --> 00:33:18.905
Jane Austen looked at it and
laughed at it and devised a

00:33:18.905 --> 00:33:22.065
perfectly natural,
shapely sentence proper for her

00:33:22.065 --> 00:33:24.578
own use and never departed from
it.

00:33:24.578 --> 00:33:28.451
Thus, with less genius for
writing than Charlotte

00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:32.000
Brontė, she got infinitely
more said.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.039
By the way, this is disputable
because certainly it's possible

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:39.948
to understand Jane Austen's
prose style as emerging from the

00:33:39.948 --> 00:33:43.259
work of Samuel Johnson and
Samuel Richardson,

00:33:43.259 --> 00:33:45.950
in particular,
so it is disputable.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:50.013
At the same time,
Woolf's point is that Austen

00:33:50.013 --> 00:33:55.343
was able to shake herself free
from this terrible problem of

00:33:55.343 --> 00:34:00.490
wanting to say something but
finding that one doesn't have

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:04.788
one's own language,
a language suitable to--

00:34:04.788 --> 00:34:08.690
appropriated by and for and as
one's identity--

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.809
for saying it.
 

00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:11.920
"So I want to write as a
woman,

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.630
I want to say the things that a
woman wants to say,

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.869
but all I've got to say it with
is a man's sentence."

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:25.791
That's Woolf's point,
and of course it has many and

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:28.699
long ramifications.
 

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:33.137
I'm holding at bay the
criticism of a great deal of

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:38.286
this that has to be leveled at
it by feminist criticism and

00:34:38.286 --> 00:34:41.659
gender theory roughly since
1980,

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:45.487
but in the meantime the
ramifications are interesting

00:34:45.487 --> 00:34:50.052
and they are reinforced by the
theoretically very sophisticated

00:34:50.052 --> 00:34:54.469
wing of feminist criticism that
we call French feminism.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:35:00.077
Some of you may know the work
of Luce Irigaray and Helene

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:00.980
Cixous.
 

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:06.422
Writers of this kind insist
that there is such a thing as

00:35:06.422 --> 00:35:08.268
women's language.
 

00:35:08.268 --> 00:35:12.594
Women write not just with their
heads and their phalluses but

00:35:12.594 --> 00:35:14.469
with their whole bodies.
 

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:19.000
Women don't write carefully
constructed periodic sentences.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.639
Women write ongoing paratactic,
impressionist,

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:31.306
digressive, ad hoc
sentences: sentences without

00:35:31.306 --> 00:35:34.666
ego--
being without structure more or

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:37.768
less corresponding to being
without ego.

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.969
We'll come back to this in a
minute in Showalter,

00:35:39.969 --> 00:35:46.311
but in the meantime French
feminism was willing to settle

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:51.409
on and for an idea of women's
writing and,

00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:57.083
implicitly behind this idea,
an idea of what a woman is that

00:35:57.083 --> 00:36:01.411
is very easy to identify as
somehow or another

00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:03.239
essentializing.
 

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:07.130
Why can't a woman write
a rigorous periodic sentence?

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:12.913
After all, that's the kind of
sentence that Jane Austen did,

00:36:12.913 --> 00:36:14.579
in fact, write.
 

00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:19.550
In a whole variety of ways that
one might think of,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.228
why can't a woman,
if she is to be free to be

00:36:23.228 --> 00:36:28.327
whatever she wants to be,
write a sentence which isn't

00:36:28.327 --> 00:36:32.659
necessarily of this gendered
feminine sort?

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:35.269
Why does women's writing,
in other words,

00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:37.619
have to be women's
writing?

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:43.380
It seems to me that it is
French feminism and the possible

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.648
critique of French feminism that
Virginia Woolf is anticipating

00:36:49.648 --> 00:36:55.409
when she embarks on this
perilous idea of androgyny,

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:59.480
of the kind of mind that needs
to be both male and female and

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.210
that needs to write in a way
that Virginia Woolf says is

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.190
actually very sexy,
precisely in the moment when

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.380
one is not thinking about one's
sex--

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.764
the moment, in other words,
when there is no longer a

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:17.539
question of the man's sentence
and the woman's sentence.

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:21.943
I think it has to be said that
although one could emphasize in

00:37:21.943 --> 00:37:26.273
A Room of One's Own this
sort of advanced criticism of

00:37:26.273 --> 00:37:30.204
French feminism,
and also of the idea that there

00:37:30.204 --> 00:37:33.789
is essentially something that we
call woman--

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:35.360
and I'm not through with that
topic--

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.085
I think it has to be said that
although we could read A Room

00:37:39.085 --> 00:37:43.025
of One's Own in this way,
at the same time we have to

00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:47.208
recognize an ambivalence on
Virginia Woolf's part on this

00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.030
subject.
 

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:53.048
There is a difference between
her insistence that Jane Austen

00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:57.110
wrote like a woman,
that she shrugged off the

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.905
tyranny of the man's sentence
and wrote her own kind of

00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:04.791
sentence,
a woman's sentence--regardless

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:08.023
of whether or not that is
actually in literary historical

00:38:08.023 --> 00:38:09.914
terms true--
between the idea,

00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:12.570
on the one hand,
that it's important to write

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.427
like a woman and the idea,
on the other hand,

00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:17.989
that it's important to write
androgynously.

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:22.105
We have to concede,
I think, the impressionistic

00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:25.869
form of these lectures that
she's giving.

00:38:25.869 --> 00:38:30.300
We have to concede that she
wavers on this point;

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.338
that somehow or another it's
very difficult to pin down in

00:38:34.338 --> 00:38:38.519
Woolf the question of whether
there is essentially something

00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:41.710
to be called "women's
writing";

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.862
just as the question behind
that, whether there is

00:38:44.862 --> 00:38:48.208
essentially something to be
called "woman,"

00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:50.590
or the question on the
contrary--

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:56.719
whether the ideal of all
writing is to shed as fully as

00:38:56.719 --> 00:39:01.260
it can precisely its gendered
aspects.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:06.824
There is perhaps a kind of
creative or rich inconsistency

00:39:06.824 --> 00:39:10.130
on this point that,
it should be said,

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.557
one also finds and needs to
take into account in reading

00:39:13.557 --> 00:39:15.489
A Room of One's Own.
 

00:39:18.539 --> 00:39:19.510
All right.
 

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:25.498
Now getting a little closer to
this whole question of beyond

00:39:25.498 --> 00:39:28.923
the gynocritical--
because Showalter,

00:39:28.923 --> 00:39:32.255
for example,
in talking about the history of

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:35.356
the novel talks about those
three phases:

00:39:35.356 --> 00:39:39.927
first the "feminine,"
the phase in which women try

00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:44.112
very much to write as though
they were men by deferring

00:39:44.112 --> 00:39:49.150
completely to male values in all
the ways that they can;

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.550
perhaps introducing a kind of,
again,

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.103
"angel in the house"
cultural benevolence and

00:39:59.103 --> 00:40:04.331
benignity into perspectives of
men that can be sometimes rather

00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:06.610
militaristic and harsh.
 

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.853
but nevertheless hiding behind
frequently male names like

00:40:10.853 --> 00:40:13.773
Currer Bell,
Acton Bell, George Eliot,

00:40:13.773 --> 00:40:18.728
and so on,
and not really entering into

00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:25.170
questions of the place of women
in society.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:29.413
Showalter then says this is a
phase supplanted by a feminist

00:40:29.413 --> 00:40:33.585
moment in the history of the
novel in which novels like the

00:40:33.585 --> 00:40:34.807
late work of Mrs.
 

00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:38.333
Gaskell, for example,
and other such novels become

00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:42.289
tendentious, and the place and
role of women becomes the

00:40:42.289 --> 00:40:45.670
dominant theme of novels of this
kind.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.445
By the way, this takes Woolf's
critique of Charlotte

00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:52.849
Brontė a little bit out of
chronology,

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:55.762
because presumably Charlotte
Brontė belongs to what

00:40:55.762 --> 00:40:58.411
Showalter is calling "the
feminine phase"

00:40:58.411 --> 00:41:02.344
in the history of the novel,
and so it's interesting that

00:41:02.344 --> 00:41:05.389
Woolf finds a kind of
proto-feminism,

00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:08.070
damaging to the texture of
Jane Eyre,

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.860
already in Charlotte
Brontė's novel.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.344
Then finally what Elaine
Showalter likes best:

00:41:14.344 --> 00:41:17.518
the supplanting of the feminist
novel--

00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:20.612
because Elaine Showalter,
too, is nervous about the

00:41:20.612 --> 00:41:24.510
tendentiousness of fiction--
the supplanting of that by what

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.264
she calls "the female
novel," which is the novel

00:41:28.264 --> 00:41:32.215
that simply takes for granted
the authenticity and legitimacy

00:41:32.215 --> 00:41:36.070
of the woman's point of view,
writes from that point of view

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.567
but,
as in Virginia Woolf,

00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:44.711
having shed or shaken off the
elements of anger or adversary

00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:51.170
consciousness that earlier
novels had typically manifested.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:56.480
This history of the novel is
very similar to what Showalter

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.608
is doing with her sense of the
history of recent feminist

00:42:01.608 --> 00:42:02.889
criticism.
 

00:42:02.889 --> 00:42:06.007
That's in two phases:
first the feminist,

00:42:06.007 --> 00:42:09.594
as she calls it,
when the treatment of women by

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:12.480
men in fiction is the main
focus;

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.552
and then the gynocritical,
which is the appropriation for

00:42:16.552 --> 00:42:18.880
women of a literary tradition.
 

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.961
Showalter is at pains to point
out that much of the most

00:42:22.961 --> 00:42:26.599
important work of recent
feminist scholarship,

00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:29.170
the feminist scholarship of the
1970s,

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:34.083
is in simply the unearthing of
and expanding of a canon of

00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:38.050
women's writing not exclusively
novelistic,

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:42.722
because there had been a time
when the novel was sort of half

00:42:42.722 --> 00:42:47.320
conceded to women as a possible
outlet for their writing.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.365
But this concession was
accompanied by the sovereign

00:42:51.365 --> 00:42:55.730
assertion that they couldn't
write poetry and plays,

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.719
and so an expansion of the
canon such that all forms of

00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:03.782
writing are available and made
visible and recognized as

00:43:03.782 --> 00:43:06.590
actually existing in a
tradition--

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.449
so that we can trace women's
writing,

00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:13.081
as Showalter puts it,
from decade to decade and not

00:43:13.081 --> 00:43:16.893
from great book to great book,
so that there really is a

00:43:16.893 --> 00:43:20.284
tradition comparable to the male
tradition that one can think

00:43:20.284 --> 00:43:22.356
about,
think within,

00:43:22.356 --> 00:43:27.340
and draw on as a creative
writer oneself,

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.592
So both Showalter's history of
the novel and her history of

00:43:31.592 --> 00:43:35.599
modern feminist criticism--
or modern women's criticism,

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:40.639
one had better say--
end at the point when it is

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:46.690
still a question of the woman's
perspective.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:52.925
But this raises a question--and
I've been touching on it in a

00:43:52.925 --> 00:43:57.121
variety of ways--
but it really raises the

00:43:57.121 --> 00:44:01.750
question that has to haunt
thinking of this kind.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.335
We're going to be encountering
it again and again and again as

00:44:06.335 --> 00:44:10.320
we move through other forms of
identity perspective in

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.199
criticism and theory.
 

00:44:12.199 --> 00:44:17.449
It raises the question whether
if I say that a woman's or

00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:21.199
women's writing is of a certain
sort,

00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:26.737
if I identify a woman in a way
that I take somehow to be

00:44:26.737 --> 00:44:31.940
recognizable--
let's say I identify a woman as

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.208
intuitive,
imaginative,

00:44:35.208 --> 00:44:39.750
impressionistic,
sensitive,

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:46.510
illogical, opposed to reason,
a refuser of that periodic sort

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:52.934
of subject-predicate sentence
that we associate with men's

00:44:52.934 --> 00:44:56.773
writing--
I can appropriate that for

00:44:56.773 --> 00:45:02.346
women like the French feminists
and I can identify women in so

00:45:02.346 --> 00:45:06.364
doing as such people--
but isn't that simply inverting

00:45:06.364 --> 00:45:09.608
what men say in Virginia Woolf's
discoveries in the British

00:45:09.608 --> 00:45:12.909
museum in the second chapter of
A Room of One's Own--

00:45:12.909 --> 00:45:17.503
isn't that just inverting
all the negative values that men

00:45:17.503 --> 00:45:20.139
have attached to women all
along?

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:25.719
Isn't it ultimately to accept
men's opinions of women,

00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:29.452
men's ways of saying that
because they are avatars of

00:45:29.452 --> 00:45:32.545
reason,
science, logic and all the rest

00:45:32.545 --> 00:45:35.409
of it--
isn't a way of saying that the

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:38.860
head is higher than the heart
and accepting,

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.603
in other words,
the lower or inferior status of

00:45:42.603 --> 00:45:47.404
this organ to this organ even
though one supposes oneself to

00:45:47.404 --> 00:45:50.659
have transvalued them and
insisted,

00:45:50.659 --> 00:45:53.059
in promoting women's
consciousness,

00:45:53.059 --> 00:45:57.309
that the heart is higher than
the head?

00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:59.815
One hasn't done anything,
in other words,

00:45:59.815 --> 00:46:03.387
to the essential identities
that have governed patriarchal

00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:05.329
thought from the beginning.
 

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:10.373
It is precisely this
characterization of women that

00:46:10.373 --> 00:46:14.409
has enabled and engendered
patriarchy.

00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:19.360
This is where the theoretical
problem arises.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.909
It calls for,
it seems to me,

00:46:22.909 --> 00:46:31.280
a sense that somehow or another
one has to put the possibility--

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.960
and there's really no other way
to say it,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.621
and this is something that
Judith Butler frequently says

00:46:36.621 --> 00:46:40.349
and people who work in the mode
of Judith Butler say--

00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:44.911
one has to put the suggestion
that perhaps the best thing one

00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:49.550
can say as a feminist is there
is no such thing as a woman;

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.809
there is no woman.
 

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:57.804
Now of course this is perilous,
and this is what drives such an

00:46:57.804 --> 00:47:02.929
unfortunate wedge in the midst
of feminist thought.

00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:06.135
In real life,
in real material existence,

00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:08.380
there certainly are women.
 

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.958
They are oppressed by laws,
they are oppressed by men,

00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:18.315
and their rights and their very
lives need to be protected with

00:47:18.315 --> 00:47:20.389
perpetual vigilance.
 

00:47:20.389 --> 00:47:23.139
The theoretical idea,
in other words,

00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:27.949
that there's no such thing as a
woman is not an idea that can be

00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:29.630
sustained in life.
 

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:33.498
Yet at the same time,
the implications of what the

00:47:33.498 --> 00:47:37.132
language of identity politics is
always calling

00:47:37.132 --> 00:47:41.159
"essentialism,"
the implications of saying

00:47:41.159 --> 00:47:45.030
"woman"
is one particular thing--

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.068
and it might be better if we
said "woman"

00:47:47.068 --> 00:47:49.904
was one particular thing,
but something other than what

00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:52.300
men have been saying she was all
along--

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.288
but making the problem worse,
saying that "woman"

00:47:55.288 --> 00:47:58.371
is one particular thing,
which is just what men have

00:47:58.371 --> 00:48:01.507
always said she was--
only it's a good thing,

00:48:01.507 --> 00:48:06.250
right, that positions of this
kind are taken up in this way,

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.996
despite the fact that they're
absolutely necessary for

00:48:09.996 --> 00:48:13.530
practical feminism and for
real-world feminism--

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:18.807
is nevertheless detrimental to
a more sensitive theoretical

00:48:18.807 --> 00:48:24.360
understanding of gender and of
the possibilities of gender.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.836
It's all very well to be
intuitive and emotional and

00:48:28.836 --> 00:48:32.963
impressionistic,
but one wants to say two things

00:48:32.963 --> 00:48:34.280
about that.
 

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.219
In the first place,
a guy gets to be that if he

00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:36.980
wants to, right?
 

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.610
&gt;
 

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.460
In the second place,
why does a woman have to

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.409
be that, right?
 

00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:46.228
It's perfectly clear in both
cases that there are exceptions

00:48:46.228 --> 00:48:51.130
which go vastly beyond the
exception that proves the rule.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:55.951
It's perfectly clear that in
both cases there are

00:48:55.951 --> 00:49:02.280
sensibilities across gender that
completely mix up and discredit

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.775
these categories,
and so for all of those reasons

00:49:06.775 --> 00:49:08.250
there is a problem.
 

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.565
Just very quickly I want to
point out, looking at

00:49:12.565 --> 00:49:16.342
Showalter's essay,
that this is a bind that

00:49:16.342 --> 00:49:21.019
criticism around 1980 really
hasn't gotten past.

00:49:21.019 --> 00:49:22.579
Time's up.
 

00:49:22.579 --> 00:49:24.909
I'm not going to take the time
to quote passages,

00:49:24.909 --> 00:49:28.510
but notice her animus--and
here, in a way,

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.023
we go back to the
beginning--her animus against

00:49:31.023 --> 00:49:33.429
Marxism and structuralism on the
grounds--

00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.579
and of course we've said this
ourselves--

00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:37.867
on the grounds that both of
them present themselves as

00:49:37.867 --> 00:49:38.860
"sciences."
 

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.860
Aha!
 

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.518
They're gendered male!
 

00:49:41.518 --> 00:49:45.572
Marxism and structuralism
aren't anything we want to have

00:49:45.572 --> 00:49:50.057
to do with because this is just
Virginia Woolf's beadle raising

00:49:50.057 --> 00:49:53.460
its ugly head again and imposing
its will--

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.570
through its superior
rationality--on women.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.449
So we don't want any of that.
 

00:49:59.449 --> 00:50:03.409
What we want instead is a form
of criticism,

00:50:03.409 --> 00:50:09.500
and this is what she says in
effect at the end of the essay

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:14.909
on pages 1385 and 1386,
that evades scientificity;

00:50:14.909 --> 00:50:19.675
a form of criticism that
engages with the reality of

00:50:19.675 --> 00:50:24.628
texts and of the textual
tradition but doesn't trouble

00:50:24.628 --> 00:50:28.179
its head with theoretical
matters.

00:50:28.179 --> 00:50:31.780
In other words,
a form that dissociates itself

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.300
from the logical,
from overarching structure,

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.139
from scientificity.
 

00:50:37.139 --> 00:50:39.630
Showalter leaves herself in
this position,

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.429
and she leaves feminist
criticism in this position as--

00:50:44.429 --> 00:50:49.862
how might one put it?--a
colonized enterprise that can do

00:50:49.862 --> 00:50:54.809
anything it likes as long as
it's not reasonable.

00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:58.726
If that's the case,
then of course it imposes an

00:50:58.726 --> 00:51:03.059
essentializing limit on the
possibilities of feminist

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.672
criticism,
just as of course the

00:51:05.672 --> 00:51:09.240
characterization of men's
criticism in the way that it's

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.898
characterized,
needless to say,

00:51:11.898 --> 00:51:14.599
also imposes limits on that.
 

00:51:14.599 --> 00:51:18.485
Whether fair and legitimate
limits, or perhaps exaggerated

00:51:18.485 --> 00:51:20.530
limits, is open to question.
 

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.829
That's not nearly as important
a point as the reminder that

00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:27.795
there is a kind of
marginalization of the

00:51:27.795 --> 00:51:31.797
possibilities for feminist
criticism involved in saying

00:51:31.797 --> 00:51:35.875
that it has to be something
other than the sort of thing

00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:40.619
that Marxist and structuralist
paradigms make available.

00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:41.309
Okay.
 

00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:45.840
Now I think that Henry Louis
Gates,

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.967
influenced by Bakhtin,
will have a very interesting

00:51:49.967 --> 00:51:55.251
way of coming to terms with this
question of what's available for

00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:59.710
a marginalized minority
criticism once it avoids or has

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:05.159
succeeded in avoiding the terms
of the mainstream criticism.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:09.969
I want you to read Gates' essay
with that particularly in mind.

00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:12.090
Then we'll come back with the
question of,

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:16.210
as it were, the future of
feminist criticism,

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:19.880
in a way since 1980,
when we turn to the work of the

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.539
gender theorists,
in particular Judith Butler.

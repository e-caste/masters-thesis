00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.192
Professor John Rogers:
I want to revisit just for

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:08.420
a moment the opening of the
invocation to holy light,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.966
which is of course,
as you know,

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.810
at the beginning of Book Three
of Paradise Lost.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.088
This page 257 of the Hughes.
This is how Milton begins the

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:22.100
invocation, as you remember:
"Hail holy Light,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.609
offspring of Heav'n first-born,
/ Or of th' Eternal Coeternal

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.540
beam, / May I express thee
unblam'd?"

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.219
You'll remember that last week
we looked at Milton's desire to

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.591
imagine himself unblamed or in
some way unblamable for the

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:43.490
condition of his blindness.
Milton had for years gone out

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.791
of his way to justify himself
before his nation and before his

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.697
God;
but that was only one way to

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.144
read this line,
"May I," and this question,

00:00:55.144 --> 00:01:00.148
"May I express the unblam'd?"
"Unblam'd," it seems to me,

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:05.433
can just as easily modify the
"holy Light" being addressed by

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:08.277
the poet.
It can correspond to the "thee"

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.409
as well as the "I" in that
question.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.766
It's this alternative
syntactical possibility that I

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:20.320
want to explore in this lecture.
I'll be focusing on the status

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.711
of this poem as an attempt to
exculpate not only this poet but

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.933
this poet's God,
to render God blameless for the

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.461
range of losses that this epic
so eloquently

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:37.973
enumerates.Look at the
sentence that I've written on

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:41.091
the board from Dr.
Johnson's Life of

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:44.175
Milton.
His purpose was the most

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:48.654
useful and the most arduous;
to vindicate the ways of God

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:53.790
to man [it continues,
I'll finish the sentence];

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.901
to shew the reasonableness of
religion, and the necessity of

00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.800
obedience to the Divine
Law.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.938
I'll read it one more time 
His purpose was the most

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:05.436
useful and the most arduous;
to vindicate the ways of God

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.718
to man;
to shew the reasonableness of

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:10.602
religion, and the necessity of
obedience to the Divine

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:13.533
Law.
Johnson here is clearly

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:18.849
thinking of Milton's ambition of
producing a theodicy,

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.077
an attempt to justify the ways
of God to men,

00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:26.038
and I think he's right to
identify Milton's theodicy as

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:29.560
really one of the central tasks
of the poem.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.245
Milton seems genuinely sincere
in wanting to provide a rational

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:37.569
and reasonable account of the
ways of God;

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.212
but you've probably noticed
that Johnson's gotten his

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:45.224
quotation wrong.
He may have gotten his

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:48.861
quotation wrong because he is
not thinking directly of the

00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.704
Milton,
but he's thinking of Alexander

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:56.039
Pope's earlier thinking of the
Milton from Pope's great poem

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.449
The Essay on Man.
Pope gets it wrong as well.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.940
Milton, of course,
doesn't end the opening

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.220
invocation to Book One of
Paradise Lost with the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.075
claim that he will assert
eternal providence and

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:10.870
vindicate the ways of God
to men.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.271
Milton says that he will
justify the ways of God to

00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:15.944
men.
I think it's slight but

00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:19.259
nonetheless there's a difference
between these two words,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.471
and I think there's something
instructive here about Johnson's

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.629
slip and perhaps something
instructive,

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.974
too, about Alexander Pope's
slip a few decades

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:32.729
before.Now when Milton says
that he'll justify God's ways,

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.178
I think he means simply that he
will account for the justice of

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:39.976
God's ways and he will
demonstrate their

00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:44.020
justifiability,
but to vindicate God's ways --

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.220
vindicate is a slightly
different word,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.643
although they could certainly
be seen as synonyms -- to

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.062
vindicate God's ways is,
I would imagine,

00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:57.680
to presuppose at the outset
that God is under some suspicion

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.242
of guilt,
that he's assumed to have done

00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:03.432
something wrong and that it's
our job to vindicate him or to

00:04:03.432 --> 00:04:06.774
get him off the hook.
Milton of course can't himself,

00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:09.940
and doesn't rightly,
use the word "vindicated."

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.671
It's too prejudicial.
It seems on some level to

00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:18.348
criminalize God's behavior in
advance, and this is of course

00:04:18.348 --> 00:04:21.439
exactly what he does not want to
do.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:25.088
That said, on some level it's
impossible for us to read

00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:28.939
Paradise Lost and not
assume that this God requires

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.196
vindication.
God seems in so many ways to be

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:36.127
responsible for the Fall,
and it might even be impossible

00:04:36.127 --> 00:04:40.480
to read the story of the Fall in
Genesis and not attribute some

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.622
of the guilt to the Yahweh who
placed the forbidden fruit in

00:04:44.622 --> 00:04:47.507
the garden in the first place.
Dr.

00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:53.072
Johnson inadvertently here
reveals something about Milton's

00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:59.500
poem that Milton himself perhaps
isn't willing or able to admit,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.664
and that's that God appears to
be guilty and it's up to Milton

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:07.896
to clear him of any suspicion of
guilt.Look at the headnote

00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:11.720
that Milton attaches to the
beginning of Book Three.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.750
This is page 257 in the
Hughes.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.126
And when Paradise Lost
initially appeared -- in its

00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:23.283
original appearance in 1667,
these arguments,

00:05:23.283 --> 00:05:25.579
or headnotes,
weren't there.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.291
He added them to a later
printing presumably at the

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.762
request of a printer who thought
that the readers needed a little

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:34.808
help with the poem.
You actually may want to think

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:38.286
about it, this is an interesting
phenomenon and very little

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:40.804
written about:
the general relation between

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:43.981
these summarized arguments --
they're essentially plot

00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:46.379
summaries -- to the actual
story,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.509
the actual narrative that
follows in each book.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.519
The beginning of this argument
strikes me as an especially

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.213
interesting one.
So this is Milton's argument

00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:58.425
for Book Three.
God sitting on his Throne

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.569
sees Satan flying towards this
world, then newly created;

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.709
shows him to the Son,
who sat at his right hand;

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.860
foretells the success of Satan
in perverting mankind;

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.600
clears his own Justice and
Wisdom from all imputation,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.553
having created Man free and
able enough to have withstood

00:06:17.553 --> 00:06:21.509
his Tempter…
I'm just going to focus on a

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.259
couple of those clauses:
"foretells the success of Satan

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.819
in perverting mankind…"
Then we get Milton's semicolon,

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.693
and then, "clears his own
Justice and Wisdom from all

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.622
imputation..."
You kind of get the feeling

00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:39.762
here -- at least I get the
feeling here -- that this

00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:43.456
semicolon is working as hard as
it possibly can to yoke these

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:46.350
seemingly conflicting principles
together.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.552
I'm not sure it's the case that
any semicolon is up to such an

00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:55.163
enormous theological task.
In this formulation,

00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:58.099
Milton seems to own up on some
level to Johnson's

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.770
characterization of the theodicy
of Paradise Lost as a

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.001
vindication.
God needs to clear his own

00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.971
justice.
He needs to clear his name,

00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.804
in essence because that name
has been clouded over with some

00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:18.046
kind of suspicion.Now I take
this absolutely seriously that I

00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:22.470
think it has to be seen as
authentic and sincere,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.722
Milton's desire to justify God.
He needs to imagine a God who

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:30.990
can't be held responsible for
the Fall because only a

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.886
blameless God could be worthy of
Milton's praise or even worthy

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:38.678
of Milton's interest.
Frankly, I think that Milton

00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:43.226
does a pretty decent job of
representing a God who cannot be

00:07:43.226 --> 00:07:47.466
seen as some kind of guilty
coconspirator in the Fall of

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:50.106
man.
He does a pretty decent job

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:53.277
vindicating God,
but then when we think about

00:07:53.277 --> 00:07:57.362
it,
there are few poets more adept

00:07:57.362 --> 00:08:02.720
at the art of vindication than
John Milton.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.335
Milton had been practicing the
art of vindication and the art

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.769
of defense, something like the
art of criminal defense,

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:13.489
all of his life.We looked
last time, on Monday,

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:18.026
at the lengths to which he went
in his poetry and his prose to

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:21.819
vindicate himself with regard to
his blindness;

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:25.305
but long before that,
before Milton's sight had been

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:29.201
cut off and long before his
tender orbs of vision had been

00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:31.599
quenched,
to use his poetry,

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:36.798
Milton had been exercising his
talents in the rhetorical art of

00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:39.879
self-defense.
In Sonnet Seven and actually

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:43.295
throughout the early works,
Milton was defending himself

00:08:43.295 --> 00:08:45.696
against that fear,
you remember,

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:50.506
that God would punish him for
waiting so long to begin his

00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:52.983
career,
that God was angry with Milton:

00:08:52.983 --> 00:08:56.197
Milton was already twenty-three
years old and he had so little

00:08:56.197 --> 00:08:59.151
to show for himself.
Later Milton devoted a good

00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:01.860
deal of energy to other kinds of
defense.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.566
He labored to vindicate the
radical Puritan left in England

00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:09.528
when it was held that they had
committed a crime in killing the

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:13.490
king and in raising a hand
against God's anointed monarch,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.636
when Europe was aghast at the
barbaric behavior of the English

00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:21.272
revolutionaries.
Milton wrote in Latin for the

00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:25.929
benefit of the entire European
intellectual community two

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:29.340
defenses of the crime of the
regicide.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.418
He wrote a First Defense of
the English People and then

00:09:32.418 --> 00:09:34.992
a work entitled the Second
Defense of the English

00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:36.859
People,
 and there is no

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:39.897
question that he would have been
capable, had there been time or

00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:42.831
had there been interest,
of writing a third defense and

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:45.287
a fourth defense.
The labor of defense,

00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:49.016
the work of vindication,
was something that Milton was

00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:53.026
getting very good at and it
really goes to the core of his

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.700
intellectual
temperament.Now,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.753
Milton lays the groundwork for
his sweeping vindication of God

00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:03.872
in the discussion in Book Three
between the heavenly Father and

00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:06.095
his Son.
This is essentially the same

00:10:06.095 --> 00:10:08.794
theology that Milton will
establish in the theological

00:10:08.794 --> 00:10:11.849
treatise that he's writing at
the same time that he's writing

00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:14.367
Paradise Lost,
On Christian Doctrine,

00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:17.669
parts of which were
assigned for today's class.

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:21.691
Now it's important for Milton
to establish something like --

00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:25.440
and this is what he gets to do
in the venue of the prose

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.325
treatise as opposed to the poem:
he has the opportunity to

00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:33.210
establish a theoretical basis
for a lot of his beliefs and

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.299
thus a theoretical basis for his
vindication of God.

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:39.559
He needs to prove
theologically,

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:43.275
not just poetically or
narratively, that God did not

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:47.574
place Adam and Eve in the garden
with the intent or with the

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:52.019
purpose in mind of punishing
them for eating the fruit.

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:55.056
He needs to convince himself
and he needs to convince his

00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:57.750
reader, Milton does,
that the fact of God's

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.364
foreknowledge of the Fall
doesn't in any way cause the

00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:05.120
Fall.
This is a huge worry not just

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.990
for Milton but for all
philosophically minded

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.375
Christians,
that the faculty of free will

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:17.109
is a genuine faculty -- this is
something that Milton really

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:20.020
needs to believe -- and that
it's not just some

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.994
papier-m&amp;acir
c;ché concept pasted

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:26.222
together by a cynical and
manipulative deity or by a

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:29.766
cynical and manipulative
poet.In order to assert this

00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:33.879
belief in a genuinely meaningful
faculty of free will,

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:38.902
Milton has to tackle head on
the theology of his fellow

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:44.389
Puritans, the prevailing
theology of his fellow Puritans.

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:48.761
Milton has to dismantle -- and
this is no easy task --

00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:53.710
dismantle the Calvinist doctrine
of divine predestination.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.598
Now the most prevalent belief
among Milton's contemporary

00:11:57.598 --> 00:12:01.210
Puritans was this belief in
divine predestination.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.573
Nearly all the men and women
that we can identify comfortably

00:12:05.573 --> 00:12:10.010
as Puritans embrace the faith in
God's omnipotence outlined in

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.133
the works of John Calvin,
Calvin being the

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:16.428
sixteenth-century Swiss
theologian -- actually French

00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:20.104
theologian -- living in Geneva
who insisted that everyone's

00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:23.906
salvation could be traced back
ultimately to the predestinary

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:27.751
will of God.
For Calvin, God has not only

00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:32.374
known since the beginning of
time what we will do,

00:12:32.374 --> 00:12:38.129
but God actually causes us in
some sense to do what we do.

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:43.183
There's very little space for a
meaningful range of free will in

00:12:43.183 --> 00:12:47.620
a strict Calvinist system.
It's God then who has for

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.703
Calvin elected in advance who
will be saved and who will be

00:12:52.703 --> 00:12:55.639
damned;
and Calvin was justified -- or

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:59.004
at least he felt he was
justified, and many of his

00:12:59.004 --> 00:13:03.124
followers felt he was justified
-- in this assertion of God's

00:13:03.124 --> 00:13:07.518
control when he read the passage
from Saint Paul's Epistle to the

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:10.091
Romans.
This is the passage:

00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:13.880
"For whom" -- oh,
let me read the whole thing.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.148
This is Romans 8:29.
For whom he did foreknow,

00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:22.065
he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his

00:13:22.065 --> 00:13:24.054
Son,
Moreover whom he did

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.989
predestinate,
them he also called:

00:13:25.989 --> 00:13:28.998
and whom he called,
them he also justified:

00:13:28.998 --> 00:13:32.960
and whom he justified,
them he also glorified.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.878
"For whom he did foreknow,
he also did predestinate":

00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:41.400
it's a perfectly devastating
Bible verse for anyone committed

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.600
to a strong stance as Milton was
in the Doctrine of Free Will.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.451
On some level,
at least in this passage from

00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:54.630
Saint Paul, Romans 8:29,
scripture seemed to provide

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.055
incontrovertible evidence for
the fact that God already

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:03.206
predestined the elect,
those Christians who had

00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:07.384
arbitrarily at the very
foundation of time been elected

00:14:07.384 --> 00:14:10.720
for salvation;
and that by extension God had

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.411
also -- and this is another
important component of the

00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:18.800
Calvinist theological system --
arbitrarily marked another group

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.910
of men and women for punishment
and eternal damnation.It

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.084
seems incontrovertible,
but this course is about Milton

00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:30.177
and, of course,
nothing is incontrovertible for

00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:32.698
Milton.
You see him tangle with just

00:14:32.698 --> 00:14:35.471
this passage,
this passage from the Book of

00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:39.629
Romans, for two solid pages in
On Christian Doctrine.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.118
You just have a sense that
Milton is saying,

00:14:42.118 --> 00:14:45.070
"This can't possibly mean what
it seems to mean."

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.107
There's a genuine and powerful
urgency charging Milton's --

00:14:49.107 --> 00:14:53.215
it's like a wrestling match,
almost, with a biblical passage

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:55.928
like this.
So one of the important

00:14:55.928 --> 00:15:00.387
conclusions that Milton comes to
in his wrestling match with

00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:03.259
scripture is that the term
"elect,"

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:07.277
as Saint Paul uses it in the
Bible, doesn't refer to God's

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:11.799
absolute predestination.
Actually, let me ask you to

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:16.863
turn to your Hughes.
This is page 921 of the

00:15:16.863 --> 00:15:21.353
Christian Doctrine.
Milton writes that "I

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:25.691
conclude that believers are the
same as the elect,

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:30.029
and that the terms are used
indiscriminately."

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:33.310
I'm going to read that again:
"I conclude that believers are

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.756
the same as the elect,
and the terms are used

00:15:35.756 --> 00:15:39.158
indiscriminately."
Believers are the elect and

00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:43.030
because of course,
on some level we get to choose

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.357
whether or not we believe,
we therefore get to choose,

00:15:47.357 --> 00:15:51.553
and we have some agency in,
whether or not we are going to

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:55.454
be one of God's elect.This
is one of Milton's most

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:59.576
compelling and really wonderful
perversions of mainstream

00:15:59.576 --> 00:16:03.090
Calvinist theology.
Calvin had insisted on

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.093
predestination to assert God's
absolute control over his

00:16:07.093 --> 00:16:10.731
creation and God's absolute
control over that final

00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:14.661
separation at the end of time
between the saved and the

00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:19.309
damned.
Calvin felt that his theology

00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:26.693
was the least we owed to the
grandeur and the omnipotence of

00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:28.789
God,
but for Milton to say that

00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:31.230
believers are the same as the
elect is essentially,

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.600
I think, on some level to strip
God of that control.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.648
It's as if Milton were
defending something like a

00:16:38.648 --> 00:16:43.345
usurpation of God's authority,
and it's the same strategy that

00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:47.299
you will see Milton employing
time and again.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:51.386
It's the damndest thing:
he's able to take the most

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:55.882
depressingly constrictive
biblical doctrine and he turns

00:16:55.882 --> 00:17:00.540
it into a proof for his own
faith in man's absolutely free

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.258
will.
Milton's philosophy of -- he's

00:17:03.258 --> 00:17:06.593
not the only person doing this,
but he does it with more

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:10.109
ingenuity perhaps than just
about any of his contemporaries

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:13.079
-- of free will is often called
Arminianism.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.352
Arminianism is named after the
sixteenth-century Dutch

00:17:17.352 --> 00:17:21.870
theologian James Arminius;
I can't remember the Dutch name

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.515
off the top of my head,
but Jacobus Arminius is the

00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:28.869
Latin name that he published
under.Now,

00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:32.569
I've been speaking of the
theology of free will as if it

00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:35.528
were simply a matter of
religious doctrine or

00:17:35.528 --> 00:17:38.690
exclusively a matter of
religious doctrine.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.779
Of course, probably more
importantly than any other way

00:17:41.779 --> 00:17:44.009
it is a matter of religious
doctrine,

00:17:44.009 --> 00:17:48.161
but religion -- and I think
this can be said not just for

00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:52.684
Milton, it surely can be said
for all of us -- religion serves

00:17:52.684 --> 00:17:55.650
a whole range of cultural
functions.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.321
We saw last time some of the
deeply personal uses to which

00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:01.769
Milton was able to put his
theology.

00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:05.845
Just as he needs to prove that
God's omniscience and

00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:10.880
omnipotence is not a sign of his
responsibility for the Fall,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.006
Milton needed to prove that his
blindness wasn't a sign of God's

00:18:16.006 --> 00:18:20.725
punishment of Milton.That
was a personal motivation for

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:25.119
some of the theological energies
of Milton's poem,

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:29.185
but I think more central to
Milton's theology than anything

00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:32.690
like a personal motivation is
Milton's politics,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.809
although the political sphere
is intimately intertwined with

00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:40.579
anything that we would want to
think of as personal.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:44.598
Theology and political
philosophy -- these obviously

00:18:44.598 --> 00:18:49.009
seem to us such radically
distinct spheres of thought,

00:18:49.009 --> 00:18:53.008
but they're incredibly closely
intertwined in the seventeenth

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:56.740
century, and I think there are
all sorts of political and

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.740
social motivations for Milton's
theology.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.776
There are political and social
reasons for the fact that some

00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:07.275
of the period's radical
intellectuals like Milton are

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:11.110
beginning radically to assert
the importance of man's free

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.821
will and,
beginning at the same time,

00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:17.225
to diminish the authority that
had traditionally in the

00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:19.809
Calvinist system been accorded
to God.

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:25.000
I think there's a political
significance to the period's

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.285
renewed attachment to and
investment in the philosophy or

00:19:30.285 --> 00:19:34.194
the theology of Arminius who,
as you can see,

00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:37.319
had died at the very beginning
of the seventeenth century.

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:41.225
Arminianism has a new wave,
maybe its third wave,

00:19:41.225 --> 00:19:45.700
by the later part of the
seventeenth century.Now,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.035
as we know from the treatise
Areopagitica and from

00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:52.900
Milton's regicide writings as
well,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.061
Milton was establishing himself
in the middle part of the

00:19:57.061 --> 00:19:59.960
century as one of England's
foremost,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.233
one of England's most
articulate, spokesmen for a

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:08.367
phenomenon that we can call,
although it's an anachronistic

00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:11.735
term, liberalism.
And so obviously the word

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:15.614
liberalism hasn't emerged
yet, but you have something like

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.578
a theory of liberalism,
or at least a theory of

00:20:18.578 --> 00:20:21.234
libertarianism,
beginning to assert itself in

00:20:21.234 --> 00:20:23.710
the middle of the seventeenth
century.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.963
You have a serious formulation
of liberalism later in the

00:20:27.963 --> 00:20:31.989
seventeenth century shortly
after Milton dies with the

00:20:31.989 --> 00:20:35.827
philosopher John Locke,
who was a great reader of

00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:38.081
Milton.
Traditional Renaissance

00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:42.539
political thought before Locke,
and I think you can say before

00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:45.609
Milton, was more or less
authoritarian.

00:20:45.609 --> 00:20:49.072
It placed a monarch at the top
of the society,

00:20:49.072 --> 00:20:52.485
at the top of the polity.
Traditional Renaissance

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:55.970
political thought needed to
imagine that monarch's control,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.690
his ultimate governance over
the behavior and the actions of

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.089
all of the individuals in that
society -- this political

00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:09.650
philosophy invariably asserted
the importance of a radical

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.769
image of centralization of
power.

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:15.879
It's really not until the
middle of the seventeenth

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:19.610
century that Europeans -- and
it's not just Englishmen -- are

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.906
beginning to articulate any
serious alternative to the

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:26.522
authoritarian,
centralized model of political

00:21:26.522 --> 00:21:30.059
organization.
There are people on the radical

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:34.683
left, and Milton is one of them,
who begin to posit the idea

00:21:34.683 --> 00:21:39.150
that the disbursed individuals
throughout a society can be

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.695
reasonably depended on to govern
themselves with sufficient

00:21:43.695 --> 00:21:47.962
self-control.Of course,
such a theory assumes a lot of

00:21:47.962 --> 00:21:50.163
things.
It assumes a sufficient degree

00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:53.119
of self-control that every
individual would have.

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:57.824
With this self-control,
rational individuals could

00:21:57.824 --> 00:22:03.104
organize themselves without a
king, without the top-down

00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:07.039
hierarchical structure of a
monarchy.

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:11.643
This position is most often
associated in England,

00:22:11.643 --> 00:22:17.279
at least in the middle of the
century, with the Levellers.

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:21.995
The Levellers are the
high-minded intellectual

00:22:21.995 --> 00:22:28.387
component of the army during the
English Revolution during the

00:22:28.387 --> 00:22:32.369
middle of the seventeenth
century,

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:36.951
and the leveler theory of
sovereignty is something like an

00:22:36.951 --> 00:22:40.382
elected sovereignty.
If there is a sovereign,

00:22:40.382 --> 00:22:44.259
that sovereign will be elected
or chosen by the people;

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:47.980
the sovereign's not going to be
imposed upon the people.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.379
So election in a lot of ways is
not simply a theological term,

00:22:52.379 --> 00:22:56.494
obviously to this day.
It has political resonances as

00:22:56.494 --> 00:23:00.867
well.So this brand-new
liberal -- what I'm calling a

00:23:00.867 --> 00:23:05.160
liberal-- theology is not only
political in nature.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.037
However, it's also economic.
It's precisely the same period,

00:23:11.037 --> 00:23:14.730
the mid-seventeenth century,
when something like –

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.820
again, I'll use the term
anachronistically -- when

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.668
something like a liberal market
theory of economic exchange is

00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:25.472
being theorized.
I'll give you a brief history

00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:29.680
of economic thought in the early
modern period.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.778
Up until this point,
it was assumed that the only

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:36.716
efficient way to organize the
economic life of a nation was to

00:23:36.716 --> 00:23:39.170
have the monarch -- the
sovereign,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.963
the authoritarian center of the
government -- fix prices and

00:23:43.963 --> 00:23:47.700
determine the value of currency:
in general,

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.930
to oversee the dynamics of just
about all economic exchange.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.601
But suddenly -- and this really
is happening in the 1650s and

00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.333
it's happening first in England
-- suddenly a liberal economic

00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:04.203
theory is coming into view.
It was being conjectured that

00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:08.150
individuals, meaning individual
merchants, could freely set

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.097
prices and values according to
the law of supply and demand

00:24:12.097 --> 00:24:16.453
rather than according to the law
of the authoritarian will of the

00:24:16.453 --> 00:24:19.312
king.
There's a wonderful book on

00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:23.849
this subject by Joyce Appleby if
any of you are interested.

00:24:23.849 --> 00:24:26.074
I can't remember what it's
called, but you'll figure out

00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:27.530
[laughs]
from Orbis [the Yale library

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.066
search engine]
which of Joyce Appleby's

00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:31.852
wonderful books this is.
The argument is essentially

00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:35.289
that a free-market philosophy
had simply been unthinkable.

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:38.442
Free free-market philosophy
that we just take as a given

00:24:38.442 --> 00:24:41.423
almost was unthinkable before
the middle years of the

00:24:41.423 --> 00:24:45.218
seventeenth century.So,
you have these two enormous

00:24:45.218 --> 00:24:49.479
shifts in the way that English
intellectuals were thinking

00:24:49.479 --> 00:24:54.039
about their political and also
about their economic lives.

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:57.216
It seems to me that it only
stands to reason that there's

00:24:57.216 --> 00:25:00.393
going to be a corresponding
shift or some sort of related

00:25:00.393 --> 00:25:02.890
shift on the level of religious
thought.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.106
If individuals are going to be
liberated from their earthly

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:11.104
monarch, if merchants are going
to be liberated from the

00:25:11.104 --> 00:25:14.812
centralizing power of the
sovereign in charge of the

00:25:14.812 --> 00:25:19.065
economy,
then individual souls are going

00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:24.804
to have to be liberated at least
to some extent from the

00:25:24.804 --> 00:25:31.066
predestinary stronghold of the
heavenly monarch as well -- as

00:25:31.066 --> 00:25:36.179
if intellectual life could
operate with these huge

00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:40.638
analogous forms.
I think that that's one of the

00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:44.961
functions of Milton's insistence
on his liberal theology of free

00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:48.808
will.
It's as if he needs to bring

00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:55.168
his religion in line with his
liberal politics.Now,

00:25:55.168 --> 00:25:59.880
let's look at the dialogue in
heaven.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.660
Turn to page 260 in the
Hughes.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.210
This is Book Three,
line ninety-three.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.037
It's here in the dialogue in
heaven between the Father and

00:26:14.037 --> 00:26:17.662
the Son where so many of the
tensions between Calvinist

00:26:17.662 --> 00:26:21.825
predestination and Miltonic free
will get worked out -- but let

00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:25.213
me digress for a moment.
Before we actually look at the

00:26:25.213 --> 00:26:28.097
dialogue, I think it's important
to ask why it is -- and I think

00:26:28.097 --> 00:26:30.797
people have been asking this
question ever since people have

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:33.452
been reading Paradise Lost
-- why it is that God the

00:26:33.452 --> 00:26:36.519
Father and God the Son need to
be holding a dialogue at all.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:40.539
"What is it that they need to
say to one another?"

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:44.540
I think we can reasonably
ask.For orthodox Christians

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.041
in Milton's time and I think for
a lot of orthodox Christians in

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:52.152
our time,
the Father and the Son are

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:55.509
members of what's known as the
Trinity.

00:26:55.509 --> 00:26:59.254
The Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit are paradoxically --

00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:02.744
according to most Trinitarian
thinking -- three separate

00:27:02.744 --> 00:27:05.220
entities,
but they are also most

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.099
importantly one unified entity.
Because they are all one and

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:14.173
all equally one,
it borders almost on blasphemy

00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:19.930
to imagine the Father and the
Son needing to discuss anything,

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.715
but Milton realized that -- and
this was an extraordinary and

00:27:24.715 --> 00:27:29.580
bold move on his part -- Milton
argued that there was no basis

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.009
in scripture for belief in the
Trinity;

00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:36.395
people had always known that
the word Trinity actually

00:27:36.395 --> 00:27:38.369
appears nowhere in the
scripture.

00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:41.713
You can see Milton in the
Christian Doctrine

00:27:41.713 --> 00:27:45.130
supplying mountains,
literally mountains,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:49.691
of scriptural evidence to
disprove the Christian doctrine

00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:54.333
of the Trinity.Milton took
very seriously the biblical

00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:59.445
metaphors of Father and Son.
The Father and the Son are not

00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:03.662
aspects of the same deity.
They are literally for Milton a

00:28:03.662 --> 00:28:06.130
father and a son,
and when God refers in

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.864
scripture to "my only begotten
Son" or to "my first begotten

00:28:09.864 --> 00:28:12.430
son" he really means it,
according to Milton.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:18.054
The Father generates the Son.
He gives birth to Him at a

00:28:18.054 --> 00:28:23.927
specific moment in pre-creation
history, and Milton is therefore

00:28:23.927 --> 00:28:28.029
-- he has been called a
subordinationist.

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:31.943
He subordinates the Son to the
Father because the Son will

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:35.789
never be -- or at least not
until the very end of time --

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:38.329
will never be the Father's
equal;

00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:43.984
and so the Son can in no way be
imagined identical or equal to

00:28:43.984 --> 00:28:47.015
the Father.
The Father can when he chooses

00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:50.179
-- and this happens in
Paradise Lost -- he can

00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:53.039
grant a certain measure of power
to the Son,

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:58.817
but the Son in no way possesses
any kind of power that hasn't

00:28:58.817 --> 00:29:02.670
been granted to him at God's
pleasure.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.360
The Son nothing like the
foreknowledge or omnipotence

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.411
that the Father has.Now,
we see the Son doing things,

00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:16.380
performing actions,
in Paradise Lost.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.219
For example,
he's responsible for having

00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:22.917
created or serving as the
vehicle for the creation of the

00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:26.220
entire known universe:
not negligible perhaps,

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.497
but he can only perform these
God-like feats and he can only

00:29:30.497 --> 00:29:33.164
be called God-like,
not actually God,

00:29:33.164 --> 00:29:36.599
when the Father permits him to
perform such feats.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.815
He needs his Father's
permission and,

00:29:38.815 --> 00:29:41.708
like Adam and Eve,
it's beholden upon the Son to

00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:45.931
obey the Father.
This is crucial to Milton's

00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:48.967
theology.
Look at how all these

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:54.567
essentially domestic relations
get theologized in the dialogue

00:29:54.567 --> 00:29:58.789
in heaven, line ninety-three of
Book Three.

00:29:58.789 --> 00:30:02.962
The Father of course -- and it
just drives me crazy -- the

00:30:02.962 --> 00:30:07.209
Father speaks in the future
tense of absolute foreknowledge

00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:10.454
because he can;
and you're right to think -- I

00:30:10.454 --> 00:30:13.731
hope you've thought -- that
there's something a little

00:30:13.731 --> 00:30:17.069
chilling about the Father's
discursive manner here,

00:30:17.069 --> 00:30:22.262
the way in which he can shift
so easily between the past tense

00:30:22.262 --> 00:30:25.040
and the future tense.
So, line ninety-three.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.400
This is the Father: 
For Man will heark'n to

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.200
his [Satan's]
glozing lies,And easily

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.457
transgress the sole Command,
Sole pledge of his

00:30:35.457 --> 00:30:40.769
obedience: So will fallHee
and his faithless Progeny:

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:44.280
whose fault?Whose but his
own?

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:51.079
ingrate [Ouch!
Whose fault?

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:55.796
Whose but his own?],
he had of meeAll he could

00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:57.648
have;
I made him just and

00:30:57.648 --> 00:31:00.688
right,Sufficient to have
stood, though free to

00:31:00.688 --> 00:31:04.720
fall.Such I created all th'
Etheral PowersAnd Spirits,

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.990
both them who stood and them
who fail'd;Freely they stood

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.240
who stood, and fell who
fell.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.489
Now, I'm going to set aside
here, because I can't deal with

00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:21.812
it, this little outburst that
seems so incredibly indecorous

00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:24.230
and inappropriate,
"ingrate."

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:29.376
I am going to discuss instead
the last line that I just read,

00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:32.887
which indicates,
I think, one of the central

00:31:32.887 --> 00:31:36.240
rhetorical strategies of the
Father's speech.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.630
Now look at line ninety-nine
first.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.775
There's something liberating
about the Father's credo here:

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:47.299
" sufficient to have stood,
though free to fall."

00:31:47.299 --> 00:31:50.166
This is kind of rousing and,
as rousing as this is,

00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:52.230
the Father doesn't leave it
there.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.666
He broaches the subject of the
fallen angels and he repeats the

00:31:55.666 --> 00:31:57.938
same formulation,
but he repeats it with a

00:31:57.938 --> 00:32:02.509
difference.
Look at line 101.

00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:08.297
He's just discussed both them
who stood and them who failed:

00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:13.299
"freely they stood who stood,
and fell who fell."

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:17.362
The Father recasts that
original statement within a

00:32:17.362 --> 00:32:21.168
repetitive rhetoric.
It's essentially a repetitive

00:32:21.168 --> 00:32:23.813
rhetoric of tautology,
and in so doing,

00:32:23.813 --> 00:32:28.060
I think he exposes something of
the highly schematic nature of

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.958
his sense of justice.This
last line is often cited in

00:32:31.958 --> 00:32:36.134
Milton criticism as a positive
example of Milton's commitment

00:32:36.134 --> 00:32:42.490
to the doctrine of free will,
but I don't really buy it.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.539
I'm not convinced by the
Father's statement.

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:50.109
This line may begin with that
exuberant adverb "freely," but

00:32:50.109 --> 00:32:52.432
the rest of it,
at least to me,

00:32:52.432 --> 00:32:55.840
smacks of something like
predestination.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.221
It's a little depressing.
They stood who stood and fell

00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:02.733
who fell -- is it a stretch to
extrapolate from that a

00:33:02.733 --> 00:33:05.848
paraphrase like this:
the type of person who was

00:33:05.848 --> 00:33:09.559
created to stand did stand and
the type of person who was

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.542
created to fall did fall?
There's something

00:33:12.542 --> 00:33:15.434
disconcertingly programmatic
about the Father's repetition

00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:17.703
here,
the repetitiveness of his

00:33:17.703 --> 00:33:21.131
explanation, and the
tautological force of this

00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:25.006
formulation seems to rob the
opening word of the line

00:33:25.006 --> 00:33:29.180
"freely" of some of its
liberatory energy.Okay.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.915
That was the Father's speech.
Wonderfully,

00:33:33.915 --> 00:33:37.137
the Son seems almost to recoil
from the rigidity of the

00:33:37.137 --> 00:33:40.272
Father's position.
In fact, he seems actually to

00:33:40.272 --> 00:33:44.083
soften the Father a little.
He asks the Father to show

00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:47.763
mercy toward man since man,
like the Son himself,

00:33:47.763 --> 00:33:50.772
is a son of God.
It's at this point you get the

00:33:50.772 --> 00:33:53.411
Father's -- [laughs]
and you want to throttle him --

00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:56.723
the Father's condescending claim
that of course he knew all along

00:33:56.723 --> 00:33:59.000
that the Son would be asking for
mercy.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.309
Milton is obliged to make the
Father omniscient,

00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:03.569
of course, because the Father
is omniscient,

00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:06.805
although the entire drama of
this dialogue [laughs]

00:34:06.805 --> 00:34:09.522
is structured,
as any drama or any dialogue

00:34:09.522 --> 00:34:12.759
has to be structured,
to suggest that there are two

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:15.774
individuals who are reacting
genuinely to one another's

00:34:15.774 --> 00:34:19.124
speeches because they don't know
in advance what the other is

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:22.813
going to say.
That's what a dialogue is,

00:34:22.813 --> 00:34:29.420
but there's clearly a powerful
asymmetry here in this dialogue,

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.333
and the asymmetry threatens,
I think, to cast this entire

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:39.510
scene into something like a
potentially ridiculous light;

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:44.412
but the Son does seem at least
to have made a kind of impact on

00:34:44.412 --> 00:34:47.848
the Father.
The Father seems to relent,

00:34:47.848 --> 00:34:52.932
and the Father agrees to accept
the repentance of Adam and

00:34:52.932 --> 00:34:59.159
Eve.Look at line 194.
This is at the top of page 263.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:03.169
The Father promises to show
mercy and he promises to permit

00:35:03.169 --> 00:35:07.040
Adam and Eve a safe journey back
into his good graces.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:12.021
So line 194: 
And I will place within

00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:18.000
them as a guideMy Umpire
Conscience, whom if they will

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.748
hear,
Light after light well us'd

00:35:21.748 --> 00:35:26.159
they shall attain,And to the
end persisting,

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:30.200
safe arrive.
It's as if the Father has been

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.514
cajoled by the Son,
cajoled out of his repetitive

00:35:33.514 --> 00:35:37.448
cyclicality and nudged toward
something like a more linear

00:35:37.448 --> 00:35:39.374
and,
to my taste,

00:35:39.374 --> 00:35:43.829
a more palatable form of human
progress.

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:48.425
I think we sigh with relief at
the knowledge that all will be

00:35:48.425 --> 00:35:53.267
well again after the Fall.
We have all the earmarks here

00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:56.894
of a narrative,
moving from a beginning,

00:35:56.894 --> 00:36:00.150
through a middle,
toward an end.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.899
We sigh with relief at the
knowledge that everything is

00:36:03.899 --> 00:36:07.648
going to be okay.But of
course, this relief is only

00:36:07.648 --> 00:36:10.709
momentary.
As soon as the Father has

00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:15.389
agreed to this concession,
as soon as he's promised their

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:19.050
safe journey back to God,
he adds a condition,

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.690
and this condition appears at
line 203.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.320
This is near the top of page
263.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.858
He returns to that rhetoric of
repetition and equivalence that

00:36:29.858 --> 00:36:35.757
had marked his earlier speech;
"but yet all is not

00:36:35.757 --> 00:36:39.486
done…":
[W]ell us'd they shall

00:36:39.486 --> 00:36:41.025
attain,
And to the end

00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:44.601
persisting, safe arrive.
[It did seem pretty much all

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.559
was done but there's some
backtracking here.]

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:49.969
…But yet all
is not done;

00:36:49.969 --> 00:36:52.735
Man disobeying,Disloyal
breaks his fealty,

00:36:52.735 --> 00:36:55.869
and sinsAgainst the high
Supremacy of Heav'n,

00:36:55.869 --> 00:36:59.356
Affecting God-head,
and so loosing all,To

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:02.190
expiate his Treason hath naught
left,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:08.268
But to destruction sacred
and devote,He with his whole

00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:13.250
posteritie must die,Die hee
or Justice must;

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.292
unless for himSome other
able, and as willing,

00:37:17.292 --> 00:37:21.829
payThe rigid satisfaction,
death for death.

00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:25.181
"But yet all is not done":
you can almost hear Milton in

00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:28.349
this line catching himself and
realizing that man,

00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:31.835
of course, wasn't redeemed
simply because Adam and Eve were

00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:35.079
repentant, simply because they
said they were sorry.

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:38.548
It has the same force as that
incredibly startling moment in

00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:40.900
the Nativity Ode when Milton
tells us,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:49.199
"But wisest Fate says No,
/ this must not yet be so."

00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:51.785
Although he certainly [laughs]
gives it a shot,

00:37:51.785 --> 00:37:54.875
he can't get away from the
unhappy fact that man was not

00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:58.360
redeemed simply because Adam and
Eve said they were sorry.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.904
Man was redeemed through the
much more troubling,

00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:06.409
for Milton, mechanism of the
Father's sacrifice of the Son.

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:10.707
Milton has successfully avoided
finishing his poem about the

00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:13.868
crucifixion, "The Passion,"
the poem called "The

00:38:13.868 --> 00:38:16.070
Passion," when he was a
young man.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.731
It just went unfinished.
As you read the dialogue in

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:22.060
heaven in Book Three of
Paradise Lost,

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.721
for a while at least,
it seems that Milton is going

00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:29.855
to be able to evade the entire
question of the sacrifice one

00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:33.709
more time -- but he catches
himself: "But yet all is not

00:38:33.709 --> 00:38:36.705
done."
He forces a consideration of

00:38:36.705 --> 00:38:39.328
the atonement,
of the crucifixion,

00:38:39.328 --> 00:38:43.303
and it's crucial to
understanding exactly how it is

00:38:43.303 --> 00:38:47.118
that Milton here is imagining
the dynamics of the

00:38:47.118 --> 00:38:51.410
redemption.So Milton first
of all has to reject the

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:56.179
orthodox understanding of the
Christian redemption.

00:38:56.179 --> 00:39:00.269
I'll remind you what that looks
like.

00:39:00.269 --> 00:39:03.194
In the New Testament,
and for a lot of Christian

00:39:03.194 --> 00:39:06.864
theologians, the redemption
seems to work along the lines of

00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:09.539
something like a revenge
sacrifice and,

00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:13.095
as cultural anthropologists
have taught us,

00:39:13.095 --> 00:39:16.820
there is something like a
primitive logic,

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.458
an intensely primitive logic,
at work behind the notion of

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:23.139
the Christian notion of the
crucifixion.

00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:26.311
One of the Father's sons,
Adam, has died and so the

00:39:26.311 --> 00:39:29.989
Father will avenge that death by
murdering someone else.

00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:32.920
Of course, that means murdering
another son.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.274
This model of redemption is
based on the repetition,

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:40.690
or a repetition,
of the initial crime,

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.403
and this logic of repetition,
I think, is largely responsible

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:47.497
for that rhetoric of
repetitiveness that we hear so

00:39:47.497 --> 00:39:51.362
often in the Father's speech.
According to this -- we can

00:39:51.362 --> 00:39:55.142
think of it as a sacrifice
theory of redemption or of the

00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:57.920
atonement,
God chooses to sacrifice his

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.924
son since someone is going to
have to be punished for Adam's

00:40:01.924 --> 00:40:05.651
sin.
The logic demands that.But

00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:10.419
Milton, I think,
can imagine no aspect of his

00:40:10.419 --> 00:40:14.157
religion,
no aspect of Christianity,

00:40:14.157 --> 00:40:19.877
more barbaric than the image of
the Father's willing sacrifice

00:40:19.877 --> 00:40:23.132
of his son.
This would be a God truly

00:40:23.132 --> 00:40:25.929
unworthy of Milton's
justification.

00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:28.582
Milton's struggling here,
and there are a few of his

00:40:28.582 --> 00:40:31.755
contemporaries who are doing the
same thing in the seventeenth

00:40:31.755 --> 00:40:34.158
century.
He's struggling to bring

00:40:34.158 --> 00:40:38.383
Christianity in line with
certain standards of rationality

00:40:38.383 --> 00:40:40.458
and, as Dr.
Johnson had said,

00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:44.387
in the rest of the sentence
that I wrote on the board,

00:40:44.387 --> 00:40:48.760
Milton wants to show the
reasonableness of religion;

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.314
and so Milton replaces the
sacrifice model of the

00:40:52.314 --> 00:40:56.239
redemption with something like a
satisfaction model of

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:59.184
redemption.
According to this way of

00:40:59.184 --> 00:41:02.929
thinking, in Adam's sin,
a debt has been incurred,

00:41:02.929 --> 00:41:07.362
and this debt can be satisfied
by someone else's payment so

00:41:07.362 --> 00:41:12.102
revenge is no longer the motive.
It's something like an economic

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:15.557
desire simply to balance the
books.There is something

00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:19.260
impersonal about this new way of
imagining the atonement,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.021
and it's here that Milton gives
the notion of the Christian

00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:25.809
redemption its particular
Miltonic twist.

00:41:25.809 --> 00:41:31.340
Milton's Father does not
willingly sacrifice the Son.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.932
It's magnificent:
he simply asks for a volunteer,

00:41:34.932 --> 00:41:38.300
and the Son out of his goodness
volunteers.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.300
He chooses to make himself
mortal.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.215
It's a perfect example of how
Milton has shifted the emphasis

00:41:47.215 --> 00:41:51.885
away from Christian orthodoxy
and forced the authoritarian

00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:56.637
image of God's sacrifice to
yield to Milton's liberal image

00:41:56.637 --> 00:42:00.569
of a kind of volunteerism or
libertarian image of

00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:04.555
volunteerism.
The Son chooses to humiliate

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.925
himself and subsequently God
chooses to compensate that

00:42:08.925 --> 00:42:12.889
humiliation with the Son's
supreme exaltation.

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:17.239
You see the extent of this
compensation at line 311 in Book

00:42:17.239 --> 00:42:20.690
Three, page 265 near the bottom
of the page.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.857
God says to the Son: 
Because in theeLove

00:42:24.857 --> 00:42:29.191
hath abounded more than Glory
abounds,Therefore thy

00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:34.007
Humiliation shall exaltWith
thee thy Manhood also to this

00:42:34.007 --> 00:42:37.699
Throne;Here shalt thou sit
incarnate,

00:42:37.699 --> 00:42:42.086
here shalt ReignBoth God
and Man, Son both of God and

00:42:42.086 --> 00:42:47.320
Man,Anointed universal King;
all PowerI give thee,

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.639
reign for ever,
and assumeThy Merits;

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:54.404
under thee as Head
SupremeThrones,

00:42:54.404 --> 00:42:56.646
Princedoms, Powers,
Dominions I

00:42:56.646 --> 00:43:00.750
reduce…
To reward the Son for having

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:04.877
sacrificed himself,
the Father is going to give the

00:43:04.877 --> 00:43:08.742
Son all power.
It seems like it's going to be

00:43:08.742 --> 00:43:13.420
a complete transference of
power, and it's a transfer that

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.539
will hold until at the end of
time.

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:19.457
There will no longer even be a
difference presumably between

00:43:19.457 --> 00:43:24.318
the Father and the Son because,
as the Father says at line 341,

00:43:24.318 --> 00:43:28.086
"God shall be All in All."
There will be no power

00:43:28.086 --> 00:43:30.519
differential whatsoever between
the Father and the Son,

00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:35.282
and presumably there'll be no
power differential between or

00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:39.791
among any of us.
We'll all be joined at the end

00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:45.348
of time in one massive liberal,
nonhierarchical state of

00:43:45.348 --> 00:43:48.574
harmony.
The image of the "All in All"

00:43:48.574 --> 00:43:51.855
is Milton's most exuberant
visionary endpoint,

00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:55.355
and it satisfies,
I think, a lot of Milton's most

00:43:55.355 --> 00:43:58.826
liberal impulses.
Even the authoritarian

00:43:58.826 --> 00:44:03.748
structure of heaven -- and of
course, Milton's heaven is as

00:44:03.748 --> 00:44:08.925
authoritarian as any heaven has
ever been conceived -- even it

00:44:08.925 --> 00:44:13.253
will be transformed into
something like a fantasy of

00:44:13.253 --> 00:44:18.699
egalitarianism,
a fantasy of absolute equality.

00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:22.617
This ecstatic redistribution of
power and glory at the end of

00:44:22.617 --> 00:44:26.796
time can only come about because
the Son has willingly humiliated

00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:29.669
himself.
He subjects himself to the

00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:33.849
Father's wrath.I think we
recognize this gesture,

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:38.349
this image of the noble and
voluntary self-sacrifice.

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:41.719
This is the matter:
this is the image that Milton

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:45.300
had established in his defenses
of his blindness.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.883
Milton had written in the
sonnet that we looked at on

00:44:47.883 --> 00:44:49.324
Monday to Mr.
Cyriack Skinner,

00:44:49.324 --> 00:44:52.405
and he had also written in the
Second Defense of the English

00:44:52.405 --> 00:44:54.556
People,
that he had willingly

00:44:54.556 --> 00:44:58.289
sacrificed his sight for the
good of his fellow Englishmen.

00:44:58.289 --> 00:45:02.677
He lost his eyes "overplied in
liberty's defence,

00:45:02.677 --> 00:45:07.429
my noble task," Milton had
written in that sonnet.

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:09.795
In the Second
Defense, Milton

00:45:09.795 --> 00:45:13.005
explains that he continued to
write his regicide treatises

00:45:13.005 --> 00:45:15.990
despite the advice of his
doctors who insisted that he

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.200
would go blind if he continued
-- that's how important the

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.960
project was for Milton and the
sacrifice.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.336
You begin to see a way in which
the two dominant features of

00:45:25.336 --> 00:45:28.828
Book Three, Milton's invocation
to light and the discussion of

00:45:28.828 --> 00:45:32.719
blindness therein and the dialog
between the Father and the Son,

00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:37.386
are speaking to one another and
they're functioning in a kind of

00:45:37.386 --> 00:45:41.979
parallel fashion.Just as the
Son's voluntary sacrifice will

00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:44.719
be rewarded with his
inheritance,

00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:48.727
on some level the heavenly plot
of Paradise Lost is

00:45:48.727 --> 00:45:51.469
essentially an inheritance
narrative.

00:45:51.469 --> 00:45:55.286
The Son's voluntary sacrifice
will be rewarded with his

00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.829
inheritance of all of God's
power.

00:45:57.829 --> 00:46:01.143
Presumably too,
Milton's sacrifice will also be

00:46:01.143 --> 00:46:05.685
rewarded by God.
It's as if Milton wants the

00:46:05.685 --> 00:46:12.415
same compensation of paternal
power that the Son had been

00:46:12.415 --> 00:46:19.266
granted for undergoing his
sacrifice.Let me see what I

00:46:19.266 --> 00:46:24.537
have time for.
The transfusion of divine power

00:46:24.537 --> 00:46:29.066
that Milton imagines,
the transfer of power from

00:46:29.066 --> 00:46:32.940
Father to the Son,
if extrapolated to the

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.398
situation of the poet and his
God, would guarantee the

00:46:37.398 --> 00:46:40.739
inspired success of the poem.
What would that mean?

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:45.770
It would guarantee essentially
the status of Paradise Lost

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.379
as scripture itself,
as something divinely

00:46:49.379 --> 00:46:52.510
authorized or perhaps even
divinely authored.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.434
That, at least,
is its relation to Milton's

00:46:55.434 --> 00:46:59.264
personal concern with his own
composition of Paradise

00:46:59.264 --> 00:47:02.312
Lost,
 but this image of a

00:47:02.312 --> 00:47:06.279
kind of divine transfusion of
power and an ultimate

00:47:06.279 --> 00:47:10.107
transference of power also,
I think, speaks to the

00:47:10.107 --> 00:47:12.869
political component of Milton's
theology.

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:16.916
You have in this passage an
image of a transfer of power

00:47:16.916 --> 00:47:20.890
from a centralized authority,
the creator of the entire

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:23.760
universe, to the humble
individual.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.375
The image supplies essentially
the conceptual foundation for

00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:32.522
Milton's liberalism,
that form of social

00:47:32.522 --> 00:47:35.625
organization whereby power has
been shifted away from the

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:38.026
center,
away from the monarch,

00:47:38.026 --> 00:47:41.820
and toward the subject.
You will find images of

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.621
inheritance and of transference
and of transfusion abounding in

00:47:46.621 --> 00:47:50.539
Paradise Lost;
they crop up in all sorts of

00:47:50.539 --> 00:47:54.436
venues, often having nothing
whatsoever to do with the

00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:58.849
domestic interactions of the
godhead.These images prepare

00:47:58.849 --> 00:48:03.482
us for that beautiful but truly
outrageous endpoint of Christian

00:48:03.482 --> 00:48:08.813
history that Milton foresees,
the one that God had foretold

00:48:08.813 --> 00:48:14.514
in his speech to the Son.
There will come a point in time

00:48:14.514 --> 00:48:18.340
in which God shall be "All in
All."

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:24.340
That's an idea that works on
the level of theology to satisfy

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.795
nearly every desire;
to satisfy the personal,

00:48:28.795 --> 00:48:33.869
the social, and the political
desires of what we can,

00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:40.783
I think, not entirely wrongly
think of as Milton's idea of the

00:48:40.783 --> 00:48:46.449
liberal Christian.Okay.
I'm going to end there.

00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:52.000
We will all read very closely
Book Four for Wednesday's class.

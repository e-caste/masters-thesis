00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:05.933
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, so we're
finishing up on talking about 

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:10.567
aromatic compounds, about the
chemistry of benzene. 

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:15.533
You know, this was a big deal in
the 19th century, in part

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.433
because you had reactions
that were clean.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:23.800
The compounds were often robust
and easy to purify, 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.567
crystalize, and so on. 

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:30.000
So many of the early
developments in organic 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
chemistry, especially in the
second half of the 19th 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.067
century, had to do with aromatic
chemistry. 

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.567
Nowadays that we have more
versatile techniques for 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:44.000
analyzing things like NMR and
for separating things, various 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.267
kinds of chromatography, it's
possible to work on a much 

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.133
wider variety of molecules. 

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.933
So much recent chemistry is on
other subjects, but much of 

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.433
the classical work was on
aromatic compounds, and they 

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.600
still are important. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.033
So the Friedel Crafts reaction
we were just beginning with, 

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:06.767
and we'll talk today about some
ideas about how you 

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:11.167
design syntheses, and about
benzylic stabilization, the 

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:15.267
reactivity at positions next to
an aromatic system. 

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:18.500
And about triphenylmethyl, which
was a particularly 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.867
important compound for the
development of chemistry in 

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:26.000
the U.S. So a subtext of what
we're talking about today is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.200
how chemistry developed in the
United States. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.167
Because, as we mentioned last
time, James Mason Crafts was 

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:37.867
an American, but almost all--
essentially all his important

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:40.800
work was done in France and
published in French--

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.867
almost all of it. 

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:45.500
So although he was an American,
many people thought 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.733
he was French. 

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:50.133
You remember he started working
in Wurtz's lab, 

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.533
essentially as a graduate
student-- although he wasn't 

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.500
enrolled as a student, I don't
believe. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.467
And met his seven-year-older
colleague, a student-- 

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.567
the first student of Wurtz-- in
that lab. 

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.600
And they published a number of
papers together. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.533
Then he published nothing at
Cornell and MIT-- 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.967
that was a textbook. 

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:10.533
And then he came back to Paris
and published this enormous 

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:14.733
number of papers, 100 papers in
17 years, almost all of 

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.000
them with Friedel. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.600
And in particular, that paper-or
that set of papers-- in 1877,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.533
which was the
Friedel-Crafts reaction.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:24.867
Now how did they get into that?

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.467
They got into that because they
had been students 

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:30.233
together with Wurtz. 

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.400
And when he came back to work in
Friedel's lab, it was 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.567
natural that they should follow
up on the kinds of 

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.700
things they were doing at that
time, on the kind of thing 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.433
that Wurtz was interested in. 

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:45.233
So seven years before that
timeline started, Wurtz 

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.000
published a paper on a new class
of radicals. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.900
Bear in mind this is 1855, so
this is just before Couper and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.567
Kekulé got the idea of valence.

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.400
So this was when types and
radicals were competing. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.800
So Wurtz was in France, and he
wrote this in his thing about 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.467
a special reaction of iodides
with sodium. 

00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:10.400
And if we translate that into
modern atomic weights, it's 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.000
ethyl iodide and butyl iodide
reacting with sodium to give 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.633
ethyl butyl. 

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.233
Those are his new class of
radicals. 

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.533
So hexane plus two sodium
iodide. 

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:25.167
Now, this is the infamous Wurtz
reaction. 

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:26.600
You hear about the Wurtz
reaction. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.133
The main place you hear about
Wurtz reaction is on exam 

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.033
papers of elementary organic
students, who figure you can 

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:38.867
make any carbon-carbon bond by
taking two halides and 

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:40.133
treating them with sodium. 

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.167
But this is a horrid reaction. 

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.400
It gives terrible yields. 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.800
It was possible for him to do
this, because the products 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.067
were often gaseous, 

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:53.233
but it was not at all a high
yield reaction, because you get

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.000
a lot of cross over.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.767
You can get ethyl with ethyl,
you can get butyl with butyl. 

00:03:56.767 --> 00:04:01.267
You can get radical reactions,
you can also get ionic 

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:04.067
reactions of the ethyl sodium
and butyl iodide. 

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:06.167
It's a mess. 

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:10.167
So the question that occurred to
these guys in 1877 was, 

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.633
might other metals work better?

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:16.500
In particular, how about
aluminum? 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.000
So they tried reacting alkyl
halide, alkyl chloride with 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.533
aluminum, with the idea of
getting R2 

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.500
and aluminum chloride. 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.433
That would be an analogous
reaction 

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:31.733
with a different model. 

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:33.967
The question is, does it work? 

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:35.367
And of course, they were
chemists. 

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.967
They did chemistry. 

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:39.267
And chem is try, as they said. 

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:42.333
So they tried it. 

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.567
So what they found was, it
didn't give a very good yield 

00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:47.133
of what they wanted. 

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:49.100
It gave a lot of HCl. 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.667
And notice that that's very
different, it's not the metal 

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:55.100
that's reacting with the
chloride, it's the hydrogen. 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.333
Where did the hydrogen come
from? 

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.900
And there was lots of that. 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.367
There were as many moles of HCl
as there were of the alkyl 

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.100
halide to begin with. 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.833
But very little aluminum
chloride and very 

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:13.267
little of the R2. 

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:16.133
Now when they tried to distill
this stuff so they didn't get 

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:18.833
the gas, but when they tried to
distill they found higher 

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:22.800
boiling stuff, and it was poor
in hydrogen, when 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.200
they analyzed it. 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.733
That means that it had a lot of
double bonds in it, or 

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:28.067
rings, or both. 

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:35.067
So they decided it was actually
benzene with R groups 

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:35.967
attached to it. 

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:37.633
Where did the benzene come from?

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:39.567
Where did the hydrogen come
from? 

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:41.200
From the solvent. 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.467
Benzene. 

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.700
And an interesting thing about
the aluminum: 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.300
they found that they reaction
was initially very slow. 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.767
But the rate depended on how
much aluminum 

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.000
chloride there was. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.667
As the reaction went on, you got
a little 

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.000
bit of aluminum chloride. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.100
And the more you got, the faster
it went, until indeed, 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.867
it was almost impossible to
control the reaction. 

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:04.833
Although it started very
fast[correction: slow].

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:05.967
So they began to wonder

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.567
whether aluminum had anything to
do with it, or whether it 

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:09.833
was just aluminum chloride. 

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.100
And they decided that was true,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.233
they didn't need aluminum, 

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.800
just aluminum chloride. 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.600
So this is completely different
from what they set out to 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.300
study, it's not a Wurtz type
reaction at all, it's 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.400
completely different. 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.300
You have to rearrange things. 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.967
It's an aluminum chloride
catalyzed reaction of RCl with 

00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:29.267
an aromatic compound. 

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:31.967
It's an aromatic substitution. 

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.467
A carbon radical goes on in
place of 

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:37.067
hydrogen, onto the benzene. 

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:40.600
So it's a completely different
kind of substitution from what 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.200
they had set out to study. 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.533
But notice that it's rather
analogous to the idea of 

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:49.000
chlorine reacting with catalysis
by trichloro 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.433
aluminum that we looked at last
time, where the trichloro 

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.700
aluminum helps make the Cl minus
a leaving group. 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.933
So it looks like it could be the
same deal. 

00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:59.833
Of course, this was mystery to
them. 

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.433
This is much later insight about
what the mechanism is. 

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:06.733
But it's the same idea with RCl
instead of ClCl. 

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:13.067
And it's even possible that you
can get SN1 versions of this, 

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:17.300
where the AlCl3 pulls off
chloride and you have R plus, 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.033
if the R plus is sufficiently
stable. 

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:26.167
Ok, so they published this first
paper in 1877. 

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:29.300
The title of it was "On a New
General Method for 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.100
Synthesizing Hydrocarbons,
Ketones, etc." So a new 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.467
way to form a carbon-carbon
bond. So you could have RCl 

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:41.233
and an aromatic compound react
in the catalysis by AlCl3, and 

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:44.000
get the substituted benzene and
HCl. 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.700
Now, they say it's general, so
they tried a number of 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.333
different things. 

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:52.000
They tried R radicals that had
one, two, and five carbons. 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.400
In this very first paper, just a
couple pages, they say they 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.067
took about five weeks to do all
this work that 

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:00.367
I'm telling you about. 

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:02.600
They also used bromide and
iodide, it 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.500
worked as well as chloride. 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.467
They used toluene as well as
benzene. 

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:09.167
In fact, toluene was better
because they could get if 

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:12.133
purer to begin with. 

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:15.267
So they said they could do it--
they had a system

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:16.633
where they could keep the

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:23.233
thing warm and methyl chloride
bubbling through-- 

00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:24.567
that's a gas-- 

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:25.467
night and day. 

00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:27.967
So they ran it for a long time,
for several days-- they 

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:29.667
don't say exactly how many-- 

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.600
at 80 degrees. 

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.200
And, of course, you could do a
substitution 

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.167
of methyl for hydrogen. 

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:38.933
You could do a second, a third,
a fourth, a fifth. 

00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:41.700
So from this, they got
pentachloro 

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.867
and hexachloro benzene. 

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.867
Both of these were new
compounds. 

00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:48.733
So a new synthetic method means
a brand new compound. 

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.667
So no one had ever seen these
before. 

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:52.333
How did they know what they had?

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:55.067
Well, in the case of the
hexachloro benzene, they were 

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:58.167
able to prepare several hundred
grams this way. 

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:02.967
Its melting point was 164,
nowadays we say it's 165, so 

00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:04.633
they had very good stuff. 

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:06.967
They measured the molecular
weight and they got the 

00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:09.767
correct value within 2%, by
measuring the 

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:13.067
density of the vapor. 

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:19.167
But a strongly confirmatory
observation was that they 

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:20.200
could oxidize it. 

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.700
They tried a number of methods
of oxidation, but the one that 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.233
gave a good yield was to treat
it with cold potassium 

00:09:25.233 --> 00:09:27.867
permanganate for two months. 

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.567
So that wasn't done in the five
weeks. 

00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:34.033
But they were able to get the
hexacarboxylic acid, which 

00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:38.433
remarkably enough had been known
since 1799. 

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:41.400
Of course, in 1799 they didn't
know its structure. 

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.633
They didn't know from structure

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.900
altogether until 1858. 

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.367
But Baeyer had recently shown
that this compound, 

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:50.533
which was isolated pure in 1799,

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:56.633
was hexacarboxylic acid of
benzene. 

00:09:56.633 --> 00:10:00.400
Incidentally, the source of it
in nature is a natural mineral 

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.367
called honeystone, which is this
stuff. 

00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:07.367
It comes in nature, probably
from oxidizing graphite or 

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:08.800
something like that, I don't
know where 

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.367
it comes from exactly. 

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:13.433
But once you make a known
product, then you know what 

00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:14.167
this new stuff is. 

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:15.867
But the important thing was that
they were able to make 

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:19.633
completely new compounds, and
make old compounds in new, 

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:20.900
more efficient ways. 

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:25.300
So this was alkylation. 

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.200
It's Friedel-Crafts alkylation,
putting an alkyl 

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.367
group onto benzene. 

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:33.100
So there were other alkylations.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.967
They found out they could use an
alkyl group that had a 

00:10:37.967 --> 00:10:41.700
benzene on it already, like
benzyl chloride here, could 

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.000
react with benzene to give
diphenylmethane. 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.500
That was already known that this
was a 

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.767
good way to make it. 

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:56.200
Or they could use chloroform and
put three benzenes on it, 

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.000
and get triphenylmethane. 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.633
And that was also known. 

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:03.967
But what was new, was that they
could use carbon 

00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:07.000
tetrachloride and do one
substitution, then another, 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.167
then another, then another and
get tetraphenylmethane, which 

00:11:11.167 --> 00:11:13.367
was an unknown compound. 

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:17.033
In fact, it wasn't even known
then, because it turned out 

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.833
that wasn't what they had,
although it's what 

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:20.367
they said they had. 

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:22.533
Because it's hard to know these
things. 

00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:26.100
It wasn't that, because it's too
crowded to try to get four 

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.633
phenyl groups on a single
carbon. 

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.000
So it only did three
substitutions, not four. 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And it was the triphenylmethyl
chloride, but it didn't have 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.067
chlorine anymore, because they
worked it up with water. 

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.667
And the water changed the
chloride into 

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:47.233
an OH, an SN1 reaction. 

00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:50.700
But that was a new compound for
them. 

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.033
But they found that if you used
phenyl chloride-- 

00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:55.367
chlorobenzene-- 

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:58.233
if the chlorine was on the
benzene ring, 

00:11:58.233 --> 00:11:59.900
then it didn't react. 

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.600
So it wasn't perfectly general.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.067
But it could use alkyl or
aralkyl, that 

00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:07.933
is phenyl on a carbon. 

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:11.200
So you could have benzyl, but
you couldn't 

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.367
have aryl as the group. 

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:18.467
But then notice that they also
said it could be used to make 

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.200
ketones, how to make a ketone
that way. 

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.033
So you start with a chloride
that already has a C=O in it, 

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:26.233
an acid chloride. 

00:12:26.233 --> 00:12:30.467
And when they reacted benzoyl
chloride with benzene, they 

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:34.267
got diphenyl ketone, which was a
known compound. 

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:37.500
But this was a better way to
make it. 

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.867
With acetyl chloride, they could
get a 

00:12:39.867 --> 00:12:41.600
phenylmethyl ketone. 

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.733
That was a known compound. 

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:45.267
Here was an interesting one. 

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:50.000
With a diacid chloride, the
phthaloyl chloride,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.167
they could get a compound which,

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:53.400
I think, was unknown at that
time with two 

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.633
phenyl groups put on. 

00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:55.767
So it could react twice. 

00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:59.867
Or it could react twice with the
same benzene 

00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:04.500
molecule to give that. 

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.733
And that was a compound that was
known, anthraquinone. 

00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:09.467
So they could get ketones, as
well alkyl. 

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.933
So this is a very, very general
reaction. 

00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:13.467
Very important for synthesis. 

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:16.467
So you could use acyl as well as
alkyl. 

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:20.133
So you have not only
Friedel-Crafts alkylation,

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:26.033
but Friedel-Crafts acylation to
made ketones.

00:13:26.033 --> 00:13:30.100
What is the question mark, what
compound do you need to 

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.067
do a Friedel-Crafts reaction to
get that compound? 

00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:34.400
Name the question mark. 

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.967
Liang, what would you use? 

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.200
STUDENT: Propane with a
chlorine. 

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.233
PROFESSOR: 1-chloropropane or
n-propyl chloride. 

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:58.267
That compound. 

00:13:58.267 --> 00:13:59.533
So does it work? 

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:00.700
We'll try. 

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.033
A warning. 

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:05.067
Remember that once you put one
alkyl group on-- 

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:08.367
we talked about last time-- it
becomes more reactive. 

00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:09.900
So there's going to be a
problem. 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.333
If the product is 25 times as
reactive as the starting 

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:16.367
material, then you're going to
get higher substitution 

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:20.367
instead of being able to get a
good yield of what you want. 

00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:24.467
But the good news was that if it
was done for five hours 

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:29.967
with aluminum chloride-- this
was done by Ipatieff in 1940-- 

00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:34.833
he was able to get about a 45%
yield up monosubstitution. 

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:38.067
Now when you read "yield," you
often wonder what it means. 

00:14:38.067 --> 00:14:44.733
Naïvely, you say you get 45% as
many moles of the product 

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:46.233
as you have of starting
material. 

00:14:46.233 --> 00:14:48.167
That's what you'd read that,
naïvely. 

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:50.133
But that's not what they meant.

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.733
Because if you used up half the
starting material, so at 

00:14:52.733 --> 00:14:55.867
the latter stages you have
nearly as much of this as you 

00:14:55.867 --> 00:14:57.900
do of the starting benzene, 

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.733
and this stuff is reacting 25
times faster-, 

00:15:02.733 --> 00:15:07.633
there's no way you're going to
get a 45% yield. 

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:13.667
So what they mean is 45% of the
product is mono as opposed 

00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:16.667
to di-, tri-, tetrasubstituted.

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:20.467
So in fact, probably only about
15% of 

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:22.167
the benzene was consumed. 

00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:24.867
But still, they could get half
of the product was 

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:27.300
monosubstitution at that point.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.067
OK, that's great. 

00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:33.367
But the bad news is that of the
monosubstitution, it's not 

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:36.367
just the compound that Liang
wanted to make. 

00:15:36.367 --> 00:15:41.967
It's 60% of that and 40% of the
one we wanted. 

00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:46.600
Now that was done... So that you
could have rearrangement during

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.100
the Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:54.100
Now that was done at a slightly
warm temperature. 

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.333
If they did it at -6 degrees,
then it turned around 

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.333
and you got more of the compound
you wanted. 

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.567
But still, there's rearrangement
somehow. 

00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:05.467
How does the rearrangement
occur? 

00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:08.733
Well, remember the aluminum
chloride comes up and starts 

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:12.267
pulling off the chloride and
makes a complex like this with 

00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:15.667
the incipient cation. 

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:17.600
You wouldn't expect the primary
cation to 

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.967
form easily, right? 

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:22.467
But you've the aluminum attached
there, so it's 

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:24.967
beginning to develop a charge. 

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:29.967
But that thing that you see
there, that complex, can react 

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:31.267
with the benzene. 

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:36.167
That is, benzene comes in and
displaces the AlCl4. 

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:41.067
So you get the intermediate with
both H and the n-propyl 

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:44.367
attached to the same carbon,
that cation. 

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:48.200
And then you lose the proton and
you've got the product-- 

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.233
one of the products. 

00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:52.433
But the other product comes,
because-- 

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:54.600
so that gives the n-propyl
benzene. 

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.300
But there's a hydrogen here. 

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.567
And so what else can happen when
you start pulling the 

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:02.500
chloride away? 

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.800
STUDENT: Hydride shift. 

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.333
PROFESSOR: You can get a hydride
shift. 

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:08.833
Bingo. 

00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:13.333
So the hydride goes there, the
cation moves to the middle, 

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:15.233
and now you get the other
product. 

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:17.900
But notice if you do it cold, if
you do at -6 

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.433
degrees, you get more of the
initial reaction before the 

00:17:21.433 --> 00:17:23.133
hydride shift occurs. 

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:28.400
So it's possible to get the
product you want, at least a 

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.667
substantial amount of it. 

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:32.667
But you have to be worried about
rearrangement if the 

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:36.167
cation that you're trying to put
on is one that could 

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:37.867
rearrange to a more stable
cation. 

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.933
How about if you wanted to make
acylation? 

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:50.367
There, you don't get
rearrangement. 

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:51.767
Why not? 

00:17:51.767 --> 00:17:56.333
Because when you're making this
cation, it's stabilized 

00:17:56.333 --> 00:18:00.133
by an unshared pair on the
oxygen. 

00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:01.833
So it doesn't rearrange. 

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:05.267
It's already the most stable
cation you can get from that. 

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:08.567
So with acylation, you don't get
rearrangement. 

00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:11.900
But you need one equivalent, not
just a catalytic amount, of 

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.500
aluminum trichloride, because it
gets eaten up by the 

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.633
product, by associating with the
carbonyl group-- and by 

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.833
the starting material, as well
actually. 

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.733
But it complexes that way, as
well. 

00:18:25.733 --> 00:18:28.900
But even though you've got a lot
of aluminum chloride in 

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.833
there, you can easily get rid of
it just by adding water 

00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:34.033
once you have the product. 

00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:37.367
So now you have this
unrearranged ketone. 

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.867
But suppose what you really
wanted in your heart of 

00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:42.567
hearts, Liang, was not the
ketone. 

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:45.967
You wanted propyl benzene. 

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:47.767
Ah, that's what you want. 

00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:49.333
How can you get there? 

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:52.967
By removing the O and replacing
it with H2. 

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:55.000
And there are reagents for doing
that. 

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.667
Like the Clemmensen reduction,
treat with the zinc and 

00:18:57.667 --> 00:18:59.167
hydrochloric acid. 

00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:03.500
Now that's a very strong acidic
medium, so maybe other 

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.267
things in your compound wouldn't
stand up to it. 

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:09.367
Propyl benzene is one thing, a
more complicated molecule is 

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:10.467
something else. 

00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:13.567
Maybe the thing you want won't
tolerate acid, but it will 

00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:15.033
tolerate base. 

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:18.400
Then you could use the
Wolff-Kishner reduction, with 

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.700
hydrazine and potassium
hydroxide. 

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.400
But notice it's done at 200
degrees, so that's a very 

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.833
vigorous thing. 

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:28.533
And, if neither of these work--
both of them are cheap 

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:30.100
and give good yields-- 

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.267
but if neither of them work,
there are other reagents 

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:33.600
nowadays that you could use. 

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.900
Those are the classical reagents
for changing the acyl 

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.867
to an alkyl. 

00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:40.767
But the important thing to see
here is that you've now been 

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:44.033
able to make that compound
without worrying about the 

00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:46.367
rearrangement, by going by way
of the ketone. 

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.567
So that's a synthetic strategy.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:55.067
So let's think about what things
you can get from 

00:19:55.067 --> 00:19:58.533
benzene, what groups you can put
on using aromatic 

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:02.200
substitutions that we talked
about last time, and also the 

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.900
alkyl and acyl Friedel-Crafts
reactions. 

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.400
We said you could put deuterium
on with D2SO4. 

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.300
Chlorine on with chlorine and
AlCl3, or bromine 

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.567
with bromine and FeBr3. 

00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:18.633
Or other metal salts could work
as well, these so-called 

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:20.667
Lewis acids. 

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:23.200
Or you could use the
Friedel-Crafts acylation

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.633
and make a ketone,

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:27.367
or alkylation and make
an alkyl compound-- as long as 

00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:29.800
it doesn't rearrange. 

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.867
Or you could even put CO on HCl.

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:38.200
HCl will protonate CO to make
the cation that then puts on 

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.533
HC=O as a substitution reaction.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.267
So that one would work too. 

00:20:43.267 --> 00:20:47.333
Or you could put a nitro group
on, we said, with nitric acid, 

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.333
sometimes with sulfuric acid, if
you need 

00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:50.833
it to be more reactive. 

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:57.033
Or you could put on SO3H, that
is SO3 can get protonated by 

00:20:57.033 --> 00:21:01.833
sulfuric acid and then the HSO3
can go on and give these 

00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:03.767
sulfonic acid products. 

00:21:03.767 --> 00:21:05.900
So there are lots of different
things you can put on 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.933
benzene this way. 

00:21:08.933 --> 00:21:12.933
And in fact, the sulfonic acid
can come off again, the SO3 can

00:21:12.933 --> 00:21:16.000
come off again if you treat it
very hot with steam. 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.767
And you might wonder, why would
you do that if you went 

00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:24.233
to all the work to put it on? 

00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:28.200
And you'll see shortly why that
is. 

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.867
You can also get other compounds
by changing these 

00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:32.233
groups into something else. 

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:34.000
For example, the nitro group. 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.833
You can reduce it, either
catalytically with palladium 

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:40.667
or by using a reagent and a
metal, like tin and HCl and 

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:43.500
get aniline, the aminobenzene. 

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.100
So NO2 can become NH2. 

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.100
And then you could treat NH2
with nitrous acid. 

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.200
It's sodium nitrite and HCl. 

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.567
The HCl protonates it, you get
nitrous acid. 

00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:06.867
And that changes NH2 into N2
plus, which is called 

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.567
a diazonium compound, 

00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:15.733
benzenediazonium chloride,
that's called. 

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:18.433
Now why in the world would you
make that? 

00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:21.300
Well, it has a resonance
structure here that has plus 

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.900
on the nitrogen. 

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.533
And that can be the cation that
does substitution, 

00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:30.467
electrophilic aromatic
substitution. 

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:32.733
And notice that you're making it
in the presence of 

00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:36.933
something that's a very active
receptor for that. 

00:22:36.933 --> 00:22:41.700
So you could make this compound,
which is important 

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.533
because it's yellow. 

00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:44.967
It's a yellow dye. 

00:22:44.967 --> 00:22:49.033
It's called aniline yellow, and
it was the first such dye 

00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:50.200
that was made; 

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.500
the first of hundreds of these
so-called azo dyes that 

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.867
are all different colors. 

00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:57.400
I looked it up on the web to see
if I could get a picture 

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.067
of something dyed with it, and
find that it's very popular 

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:04.733
for skateboards nowadays, to use
aniline yellow. 

00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:10.100
But hundreds of these were made.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.633
This was where activity was in
organic chemistry. 

00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:16.933
This was before synthetic drugs.

00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:19.700
This was before plastics. 

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.133
This was before the use of
petroleum the 

00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:23.467
way it's used nowadays. 

00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:26.033
So there weren't these
commercial driving forces for 

00:23:26.033 --> 00:23:28.067
developing organic chemistry. 

00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:29.967
But dyes were important. 

00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:32.667
So the last half of the 19th
century there was a lot of 

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:33.867
work on things like this. 

00:23:33.867 --> 00:23:35.433
So hundreds of these were
developed. 

00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:37.367
And they have fancy names. 

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:41.000
Like Bismarck brown, named after
the Iron 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.100
Chancellor of Germany. 

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.600
It was a brown color. 

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.000
And in fact, notice that there
were two of these reactions that

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.167
went on to give this
Bismarck brown.

00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:54.400
It made two of these azo groups
in there. 

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.633
I looked up Bismarck brown on
the web, and find out that 

00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:00.833
it's used as a histological
stain. 

00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:02.967
There it is. 

00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:04.367
So this was a big deal. 

00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:07.800
But that's not the only reason
that these diazonium chloride 

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.700
was important. 

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.867
N2 is a fabulous leaving group.

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:15.967
The N-N triple bond is the
strongest diatomic bond. 

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:18.367
So it very easily leaves as N2.

00:24:18.367 --> 00:24:20.933
And notice that that's a very
clean reaction, too. 

00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:23.933
When it leaves, what does it
leave behind if you lose N2 

00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:27.867
from benzene diazonium cation? 

00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:29.733
It's the phenyl cation. 

00:24:29.733 --> 00:24:33.133
A cation that's very hard to
make. 

00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:36.000
Because, we talked about that
before, it's a very strong bond

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.933
and not a good place to have a
vacancy, in

00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:42.400
an sp squared orbital. 

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.200
So there are lots of synthetic
uses for the diazonium 

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.567
chloride besides making dyes. 

00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:53.200
So you can treat it with HBr and
copper bromide, 

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.033
cuprous bromide, CuBr, 

00:24:54.033 --> 00:24:56.800
to put a bromine on in place of
N2. 

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.933
Or chlorine on in place, or
cyanide on in place of N2. 

00:25:00.933 --> 00:25:04.567
Now all these reactions called
Sandmeyer reactions, after the 

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:08.733
guy who developed the idea of
using the copper bromide, 

00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:13.000
probably go first by an electron
transfer. 

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.867
So you have CuBr2 minus, Which
is formed from Br minus plus 

00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:22.233
the copper bromide. 

00:25:22.233 --> 00:25:26.800
So that gives an electron to one
of the antibonding 

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.267
orbitals in nitrogen. 

00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:32.767
So you generate this radical
instead of the cation, and a 

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:35.133
radical from the copper reagent.

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.567
But that's very unstable, and it
loses 

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:40.567
nitrogen instantly, N2. 

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:42.000
So you have that radical. 

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.833
But now these radicals react
with one another to put the 

00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:45.800
bromine on. 

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.700
You have copper bromide, which
then adds bromide minus again, 

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.867
and recycles. 

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:53.700
So the copper is catalytic. 

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.633
So you could do it also with
chlorine, also with cyanide. 

00:25:57.633 --> 00:25:58.733
You could do it with iodide. 

00:25:58.733 --> 00:26:01.933
You don't even need the copper
there, because I minus itself 

00:26:01.933 --> 00:26:05.733
can give the electron to the
diazonium compound. 

00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:07.933
You could do it with BF4 minus,

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.433
which is probably different. 

00:26:09.433 --> 00:26:11.267
That's probably not donation of
electron. 

00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:15.133
That one probably does involve
losing N2 from the cation to 

00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:18.600
form the phenyl cation, which
then pulls off a 

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.533
fluoride from BF4 minus. 

00:26:21.533 --> 00:26:25.767
So that's probably an SN1
reaction, where N2 leaves. 

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:27.600
It's a great leaving group. 

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.767
And probably the same for the
reaction with 

00:26:29.767 --> 00:26:32.667
water, to put OH on. 

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:37.167
You could also react it with
NaNO2 to put NO2 on. 

00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:39.967
But what's the utility of that?

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.100
Why would you want to do that? 

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.600
Is that going to be, you think,
a way you're going to 

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.100
make your fortune? 

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.400
To sell nitrobenzene making it
this way? 

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.833
What's the problem? 

00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:54.033
Yeah? 

00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:57.300
STUDENT: The NO2 is a cation? 

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.267
PROFESSOR: No, that's not the
problem. 

00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:03.767
The NO2 here is an anion. 

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:06.033
NaNO2 is an anion. 

00:27:06.033 --> 00:27:09.867
We talked about NO2 plus before,
but this is NO2 minus. 

00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:11.667
So this would do the trick. 

00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:13.600
But commercially, this is bound
to fail. 

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.100
Matt? 

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.700
MATT: You used that to get the
diazonium. 

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.067
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Remember, where
did we get the diazonium salt? 

00:27:20.067 --> 00:27:21.267
We got it from the amine. 

00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:22.567
Where did we get the amine? 

00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:24.267
We got it from the nitro group.

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:26.900
So we could run our factory day
and night and turn 

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.467
starting material into product
at pretty good yield. 

00:27:30.467 --> 00:27:32.467
But you're not going to make a
fortune that way. 

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:36.600
But there is utility for that,
but it's not obvious at first. 

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.267
And the same thing is true here.

00:27:38.267 --> 00:27:42.767
You can react with
hypophosphorous acid, H3PO, 

00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:44.400
not phosphoric acid, 

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.800
and that puts H on, instead of
the N2. 

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.233
But that's going even further
back to benzene. 

00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:53.467
Why in the world would you want
to do that? 

00:27:53.467 --> 00:27:57.200
Well, we'll show you what's the
utility of that one? 

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.133
Now suppose you want to prepare
a certain compound, 

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:01.400
like para-nitrochlorobenzene. 

00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:05.233
How are you going to make it? 

00:28:05.233 --> 00:28:07.433
Well, you can start with
nitrobenzene. 

00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:10.100
And we know how to put a
chlorine on. 

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.533
How do you put chlorine on? 

00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:15.733
What reagent do you use to put
chlorine on? 

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:21.533
What, in general, to put any X
on in place of H, what form of 

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.600
X do you need? 

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.867
What's the thing that does the
attacking? 

00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:26.133
X what? 

00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:26.433
X radical? 

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:27.367
X minus? 

00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:28.633
X plus? 

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.633
It's electrophilic aromatic
substitution. 

00:28:34.633 --> 00:28:36.033
You need X plus. 

00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:38.967
So if we want to put chlorine
in, we need chlorine plus. 

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:41.267
Where do we get chlorine plus? 

00:28:41.267 --> 00:28:44.700
Cl2 plus AlCl3. 

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.967
AlCl3 pulls the chloride off, we
have the equivalent of Cl 

00:28:48.967 --> 00:28:52.133
plus, and that'll do the trick.

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:54.700
Except it won't do the trick. 

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.967
Why? 

00:28:58.567 --> 00:28:59.800
Why won't this work? 

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.400
We talked about it last time. 

00:29:09.867 --> 00:29:13.133
Because nitro is deactivating. 

00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:17.000
It'll make the reaction slow,
but still it'll happen. 

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.067
But not only is it deactivating,
what else is it? 

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:23.067
Metadirecting. 

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:25.033
It's not going to give this
product, it's going to give 

00:29:25.033 --> 00:29:27.700
the meta product. 

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.967
So are we out of luck? 

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:30.967
Is there a way of making the
parachloronitrobenzene? 

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.067
How would you do it? 

00:29:37.433 --> 00:29:37.500
Sebastian? 

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.267
STUDENT: Start with the Cl. 

00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:40.600
PROFESSOR: Start-- 

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.133
so that one's not going to work.

00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:45.200
But start with the-- 

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.200
because you'd get the wrong
isomer. 

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.633
But if you start with the Cl and
put the nitro on, now the 

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:54.100
reaction is more reactive. 

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.033
Nitro is a very strong reactive
reagent. 

00:29:58.033 --> 00:30:01.167
And chloro is ortho/para
directing, so you're going to 

00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:02.500
get the compound you want. 

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.400
Great. 

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.333
Now suppose what you want is
meta-chlorophenol, 

00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:10.467
hydroxybenzene? 

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:12.567
That's the one you want to make.

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:14.533
So how are we going to do that?

00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:19.433
Now because both O and Cl are
ortho/para-directing, so we 

00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:21.833
can't decide which one we're
going to put on. 

00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:25.400
Furthermore, we don't have the O
plus reagent to put O on. 

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.767
We have the Cl plus reagent, but
we don't 

00:30:27.767 --> 00:30:29.033
have the O plus reagent. 

00:30:29.033 --> 00:30:30.067
So how are we going to get these

00:30:30.067 --> 00:30:33.733
things in the meta position? 

00:30:33.733 --> 00:30:35.167
Well, we could put the chlorine
on. 

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:38.767
Remember, at least we got meta
things by that 

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:41.533
mistake we made before. 

00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:45.700
And now if we could convert
nitro to OH, then we've got the

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.433
product we want. 

00:30:47.433 --> 00:30:50.667
Any way of getting OH? 

00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:56.033
Those of you with rapid
photographic memories? 

00:30:56.033 --> 00:30:58.300
You convert nitro to amine. 

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.167
I think you can reduce it with
this reagent. 

00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:03.800
I'm not sure. 

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.100
But if not that one, there'll be
another one that allows you 

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.000
to reduce it. 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.667
Then HONO converts it to the
diazonium, and water converts 

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:16.600
that to OH. 

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.967
So we were able to do it that
way by way of the nitro group. 

00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:24.000
Converting the diazonium
compound to OH, 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.500
the diazonium salt. 

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.633
Or you could also make it a
halogen there, or a nitrile, 

00:31:29.633 --> 00:31:33.367
or NO2, or H. But of course, if
it were NO2, you could do 

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:36.300
it a different way. 

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.100
Now why would you want to do H
to make chlorobenzene? 

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.367
That seems stupid. 

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:48.400
So the key reaction here is
HONO, nitrous acid, for 

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.367
converting aniline, the amino
benzene into any of many 

00:31:53.367 --> 00:31:55.533
different things. 

00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:58.767
Here's a picture of the Yale
chemistry class, Sheffield 

00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:01.600
Scientific School in 1898. 

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.567
So a lot of distinguished
looking guys sitting here. 

00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:06.900
And they're showing the tools of
their trade, as we 

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.433
mentioned before. 

00:32:08.433 --> 00:32:11.533
But there's a little box at the
feet of the guy who's 

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:14.100
playing a flask like a banjo,
here. 

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.233
And do you see what it says on
it? 

00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:20.633
Hot or cold, OH NO! 

00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:24.200
So this is a little pun here.
It's HONO. 

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.233
Because this is the chemistry
they were doing at that time. 

00:32:27.233 --> 00:32:29.267
Making diazonium things and
converting 

00:32:29.267 --> 00:32:31.467
one thing to another. 

00:32:31.467 --> 00:32:35.433
So suppose what you want to do
is convert toluene into 

00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:40.533
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. 

00:32:40.533 --> 00:32:43.200
What's the problem? 

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.900
Just do Friedel-Crafts and put
methyl groups on, right? 

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.700
What's wrong with that? 

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.800
The alkyl groups are ortho/para
directing, you 

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.067
won't get this isomer. 

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.367
If you try that, it's going to
fail. 

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:06.733
But you could put nitro group on
in the para position. 

00:33:06.733 --> 00:33:10.000
We already talked about that
kind of thing with chlorine 

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.533
instead of methyl as an
ortho/para director. 

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:16.467
And now what are we going to do?

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:19.467
We've got not only the wrong
group, nitro instead of 

00:33:19.467 --> 00:33:21.167
methyl, but we've got it in the
wrong place. 

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.767
But this is an indirect
synthesis. 

00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:32.267
Notice what you can do is reduce
it, the nitro to amine. 

00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:34.033
And now you could react that. 

00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:39.667
Or if it's too reactive--
remember that the rocket fuel 

00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:42.700
was a nitration of something
like that-- 

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.333
you could acetylate it, if
that's necessary. 

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.400
I don't know whether it would
be. 

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.067
And now you do the
Friedel-Crafts reaction. 

00:33:51.067 --> 00:33:54.200
Now this is ortho/para
directing, methyl, so it would 

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.167
tend to put it here or here. 

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:59.600
But this is more strongly
ortho/para directing because 

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.100
of the unshared pair. 

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.900
And it would put it here or
here. 

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.333
So it's a stronger ortho/para
director than the methyl is, 

00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:09.667
that unshared pair. 

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:10.967
So it goes to there. 

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.167
So now you have that NH2 group
there. 

00:34:16.167 --> 00:34:18.567
So we've got the methyls where
we want them, but 

00:34:18.567 --> 00:34:19.800
we've got an NH2. 

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.067
What are you going to do about
that? 

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:27.167
What do we convert NH to? 

00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:30.767
What did the people in 1898S do?

00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:33.333
They treated it with HONO. 

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:41.033
Make the diazonium salt and then
react that with 

00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:46.100
hypophosphorous acid to convert
it to hydrogen. 

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.800
So the nitro, then the amino
group was put on in order to 

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.067
direct where other things are
going. 

00:34:54.067 --> 00:34:56.433
And then you have to take it off
again. 

00:34:56.433 --> 00:35:00.933
So there was a utility to
removing it with hydrogen. 

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:03.167
Now here's a problem for you to
work on. 

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:09.867
How to make para dinitrobenzene
with the 

00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:11.700
reactions that we know about
here. 

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.667
So you can work on that on your
own. 

00:35:15.667 --> 00:35:18.600
Now here's an interesting
compound. 

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.833
2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene. 

00:35:22.433 --> 00:35:25.967
And the interesting thing about
that one is it reacts 

00:35:25.967 --> 00:35:30.533
within an amine to replace
fluorine by the amine. 

00:35:30.533 --> 00:35:33.400
So this is an aromatic
substitution. 

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.267
But it's different from the ones
we've been talking about. 

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:37.733
Can you see why? 

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:40.267
Why it's not like the
electrophilic aromatic 

00:35:40.267 --> 00:35:42.867
substitutions we've been talking
about? 

00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.100
What makes the nitrogen
reactive? 

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:51.567
Arvind? What makes the nitrogen
reactive of the amine? 

00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:57.200
STUDENT: It has a partially
negative charge, right? 

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.467
PROFESSOR: Well it's a little
negatively charged, 

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:01.067
what's its high HOMO? 

00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:03.000
STUDENT: The unshared pair. 

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.200
PROFESSOR: Unshared pair. 

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.433
So that's what's going to make
it reactive. 

00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:11.767
Now we have nucleophilic
aromatic substitution. 

00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:12.733
The things we've been talking
about 

00:36:12.733 --> 00:36:14.567
before are plus reagents. 

00:36:14.567 --> 00:36:17.933
Cl plus, carbon plus, NO2 plus.

00:36:17.933 --> 00:36:21.800
This is high HOMO instead of a
low LUMO. 

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.967
Now that product actually is
important to make it yellow. 

00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:29.433
Because it was used when you do
chromatography, if you 

00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:31.667
spray it with this stuff, where
the amines 

00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:33.867
are will turn yellow. 

00:36:33.867 --> 00:36:39.300
So it's a good visualization
reagent. 

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.933
And it identifies the amino acid
at the end of a chain, 

00:36:42.933 --> 00:36:47.167
because if you put this on the
end of the chain where there's 

00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:53.533
NH2 and then cleave it apart and
see what the pieces are, 

00:36:53.533 --> 00:36:55.533
the one that's yellow was the
one that was on 

00:36:55.533 --> 00:36:58.500
the end of the chain. 

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.767
So this stuff was called
Sanger's reagent, after 

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:05.333
Frederick Sanger, who used it to
determine the amino acid 

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:06.500
sequence of insulin. 

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.767
In fact, he invented this way of
doing it, putting this 

00:37:09.767 --> 00:37:17.667
color label on and he sequenced
insulin in 1955. 

00:37:17.667 --> 00:37:21.267
And three years later, he got
the Nobel Prize for this, 

00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:23.933
Sanger did. 

00:37:23.933 --> 00:37:29.567
Incidentally, how do people know
the 

00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:31.033
sequence of proteins nowadays? 

00:37:31.033 --> 00:37:32.733
Do they do it this way? 

00:37:32.733 --> 00:37:35.333
Do you know? 

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.133
How do people know what the
sequence of a 

00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:39.033
protein is going to be? 

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:42.167
They do it by sequencing the
nucleic acid, right? 

00:37:42.167 --> 00:37:46.400
And in fact, Sanger got the 1980
Nobel Prize for 

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.800
sequencing DNA. 

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.300
So he got two Nobel Prizes for
sequencing. 

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.033
But this clever thing, that he,
as a good chemist, figured 

00:37:53.033 --> 00:37:56.733
out how to do, is nucleophilic
aromatic substitution. 

00:37:56.733 --> 00:38:00.500
Now how is it well designed,
this reagent, to do that? 

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.333
Well for one thing, it's yellow.

00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:03.800
The product is yellow. 

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.267
But another one is that this
anion that you get is very 

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:11.067
good because it's got a nitro
group where the charge is. 

00:38:11.067 --> 00:38:12.033
Or there. 

00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:14.500
So it's activated for forming
that intermediate 

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.000
by two nitro groups. 

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.900
Then you lose the proton, and
then you lose fluoride. 

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.500
The normal electrophilic
aromatic substitution, X plus 

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.100
comes on, forming an
intermediate with plus plus 

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.467
plus, and then H plus leaves. 

00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:37.700
Now something minus comes on, or
a high HOMO, the amine, 

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.267
minus minus minus, and then F
minus goes away. 

00:38:41.267 --> 00:38:43.500
Now why was F such a good thing
to choose? 

00:38:46.267 --> 00:38:49.333
Because F, generally, is not
such a great leaving group. 

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:53.133
The other halogens are better as
leaving groups. 

00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:56.900
It's good because the leaving is
not the rate determining 

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.400
step of this thing. 

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.300
The slow step is that initial
addition. 

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.400
So the more electron withdrawing
the substituent 

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.833
is, the better it will be. 

00:39:06.833 --> 00:39:09.700
So fluoride is the one to use. 

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.200
So it's activated by fluorine. 

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.267
So Sanger, a great chemist,
figured out a good reagent and 

00:39:14.267 --> 00:39:16.167
got rewarded with a Nobel Prize.

00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:19.367
In fact, two Nobel Prizes. 

00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:23.767
Now, another place this crops up
is in NAD plus, which is 

00:39:23.767 --> 00:39:24.567
this compound. 

00:39:24.567 --> 00:39:27.400
Have you heard of NAD plus and
NADH? 

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.000
Some of you? 

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.900
You will when you take
biochemistry if you haven't 

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.000
heard about it yet. 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.967
These are oxidizing reducing
agents. 

00:39:33.967 --> 00:39:38.200
So you have, say, an alcohol
with a secondary alcohol so 

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.567
you have an H there, 

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:44.533
and now you can do a
nucleophilic aromatic 

00:39:44.533 --> 00:39:45.333
substitution. 

00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:49.233
Notice what's going onto the
benzene is H with the 

00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:52.667
electrons, H minus. 

00:39:52.667 --> 00:39:54.933
It's helped out by the unshared
pair on 

00:39:54.933 --> 00:39:57.333
oxygen coming in here. 

00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.267
And this, then, is a good place
to put the electrons, on 

00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:01.167
the nitrogen. 

00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:07.733
So you get a ketone that got
oxidized, and this NADH. 

00:40:07.733 --> 00:40:10.933
Now the nice thing is that this
is reversible. 

00:40:10.933 --> 00:40:13.767
The energies of these two are
closely enough balanced that 

00:40:13.767 --> 00:40:16.033
you can run it backwards and
forwards. 

00:40:16.033 --> 00:40:21.800
That means this reagent NAD plus
can be used as an oxidizing

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.433
reagent, NADH can be used as a
reducing agent.

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:27.700
So you can make an alcohol into
a ketone or a ketone into 

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.733
an alcohol.

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:31.700
And these are key molecules in
biological 

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.267
oxidation and reduction. 

00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:37.033
And notice the way they do it is
by transferring H minus, 

00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:39.533
accepting or giving back H
minus. 

00:40:39.533 --> 00:40:44.433
So that's that nucleophilic
aromatic substitution. 

00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:50.567
So benzylic reactivity was
related to pKa. 

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:54.333
Remember, what's the pKa of
normal alkanes, roughly? 

00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:57.633
How acidic is RH? 

00:40:57.633 --> 00:41:00.700
Just a regular old alkane,
roughly? 

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.000
pKa? 

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
STUDENT: 50-something. 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.867
PROFESSOR: 50-something, 50 few.

00:41:05.867 --> 00:41:09.167
But if you have allylic H, it's
43. 

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.733
So it's something like seven
powers of 10, or nine 

00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:16.833
kilocalories better than a
normal alkyl group, because of 

00:41:16.833 --> 00:41:18.633
allylic stabilization. 

00:41:18.633 --> 00:41:21.867
If you have phenyl of
vinyl[correction: benzyl],

00:41:21.867 --> 00:41:22.867
instead of the carbon-carbon 

00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:27.233
double bond, it's even two
powers of 10 better, or 

00:41:27.233 --> 00:41:28.833
12kcal/mole. 

00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:32.700
And if you have two phenyl
groups on it, diphenylmethane, 

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.633
it's much better. 

00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:35.867
It's another 11 kilocalories
better. 

00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:41.500
Not quite as good as the first
one because there's not as 

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.633
high a HOMO any more, once one
has begun to lower it. 

00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:48.367
So there's a little bit less. 

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:51.167
Predict what it's going to be if
you put three 

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:52.400
phenyl groups on. 

00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.600
Luke, you look ready to go on
making a prediction here. 

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.733
How many kilocalories? 

00:42:01.733 --> 00:42:02.633
STUDENT: 10. 

00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:04.500
PROFESSOR: Another 10. 

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.467
It's 3. 

00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:10.933
The third one does hardly
anything. 

00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:12.400
Why? 

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.000
Because it's so crowded that the
phenyls have to twist, and 

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.633
don't overlap very well. 

00:42:18.633 --> 00:42:22.033
So steric hindrance in and
triphenylmethyl reduces the 

00:42:22.033 --> 00:42:27.067
overlap with the anion you want
to stabilize, so it reduces it

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:30.533
by 25% from diphenylmethyl.

00:42:30.533 --> 00:42:34.200
OK, so the crowding is an
important thing. 

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.767
And this brings us to Moses
Gomberg and the 

00:42:36.767 --> 00:42:40.133
triphenylmethyl radical, which
is 110 years old 

00:42:40.133 --> 00:42:41.533
this academic year. 

00:42:41.533 --> 00:42:45.933
It was announced in October,
1900. 

00:42:45.933 --> 00:42:51.067
So October we were already
underway in this class. 

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:54.367
So Moses Gomberg was a speaker
when this building was 

00:42:54.367 --> 00:42:58.000
dedicated in 1923, one of the
featured speakers. 

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.733
But he came from a very
different 

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:02.100
background from Crafts. 

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.633
Remember Crafts was the son of
an industrialist in Boston and 

00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:11.100
could afford to go 17 years to
Paris to do his research. 

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.700
But Gomberg was born in the
Ukraine. 

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.200
He was Jewish and his father got
in political trouble, and 

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:23.933
there were pogroms going on, so
he and Moses left and came 

00:43:23.933 --> 00:43:27.200
to Chicago where Moses-- 

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.633
he was born in '66, so here he's
18 years old, and he's 

00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:34.033
working in the stockyards in
Chicago for two years. 

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:37.133
But then, somehow, he gets to
the University of Michigan two 

00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:38.767
years later. 

00:43:38.767 --> 00:43:41.500
And here's his transcript from
the University of Michigan. 

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.200
He graduated in 1890. 

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.067
So let's look at what kind of
thing you would have taken if 

00:43:47.067 --> 00:43:50.600
you were getting a BS in
chemistry, as it says up here, 

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.300
at Michigan in 1890. 

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.333
There were distribution classes.

00:43:56.333 --> 00:44:01.967
So he took French, Rhetoric,
Logic, and Psychology. 

00:44:01.967 --> 00:44:07.567
And then these are science
classes, physics and math. 

00:44:07.567 --> 00:44:10.533
And here are chemistry related
classes. 

00:44:10.533 --> 00:44:13.367
There are metallurgy, scientific
freehand drawing, 

00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:16.967
geology and minerology, and
chemical literature in German 

00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:18.000
and French. 

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.833
And the big one in the middle,
not too 

00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:23.667
surprisingly, is chemistry. 

00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.433
So the distribution wasn't quite

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:27.867
what it is here nowadays. 

00:44:27.867 --> 00:44:30.867
And here he is as a student in
the analytical laboratory. 

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.467
After his freshman year, he
averaged nine and a half 

00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:40.000
chemistry labs a week. 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.933
That's labs, not hours in lab. 

00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:45.733
Nine and a half different lab
sessions a week. 

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:53.067
And two-thirds of them were
analytical chemistry. 

00:44:53.067 --> 00:44:57.733
That's what he's doing, he's
doing a titration here. 

00:44:57.733 --> 00:45:01.467
So there was no spectroscopy
then. 

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:04.533
Then after he graduated and got
his PhD-- 

00:45:04.533 --> 00:45:07.033
he was I think the second PhD in
chemistry at 

00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:08.033
the University of Michigan. 

00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:09.800
And it's interesting that he
studied chemistry. 

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.267
You might think as an immigrant
who had worked in 

00:45:12.267 --> 00:45:14.533
the stockyards, he would be
trying to do 

00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:19.233
some practical work. 

00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:21.000
So, in this three year period

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.900
when he was an
undergraduate, there were,

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:30.567
I think, something like
400 graduates in pharmacy from 

00:45:30.567 --> 00:45:33.933
Michigan and about five in
chemistry. 

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:35.367
And he took chemistry. 

00:45:35.367 --> 00:45:36.700
So that's very interesting. 

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.400
But anyhow, then he went to
learn in Germany in Munich 

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.700
with Baeyer. 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.367
So there's Baeyer, 61, the head
of the lab. 

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:48.100
And here's his assistant,
Thiele, who was 31. 

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:53.000
And here's Richard Willstatter,
who was 24 then, 

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.900
the fair-haired boy in the lab,
who got the Nobel Prize 

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.267
in 1920 as an organic chemist.
And here's Moses Gomberg. 

00:46:00.267 --> 00:46:04.033
He's 30 years old, older because
of his family history 

00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:05.000
than these other people, 

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.867
almost as old as Thiele. 

00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.900
But here's what Willstatter the
Nobel laureate, 

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.867
later said about him. 

00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:14.667
Moses Gomberg was Thiele's
coworker in the student 

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:15.600
laboratory. 

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.467
He was very reserved and modest,
kept entirely to 

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:21.533
himself, and never chatted in or
out of laboratory. 

00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:24.167
Some years later, the work he
carried out in the United 

00:46:24.167 --> 00:46:26.533
States on the triphenylmethyl
radical, 

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:30.367
"a case of trivalent carbon
became famous."

00:46:30.367 --> 00:46:33.700
And you know what I think the
key phrase is here? 

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.700
"in the United States." Because
remember, Crafts's 

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.967
work was done in France, 

00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:43.700
nothing in the United States. 

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:48.400
But here, just two decades
later, the key work is being 

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.667
done in the United States. 

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:51.933
So we're going to see how this
happened. 

00:46:51.933 --> 00:46:54.700
"This brilliant experiment, one
of the most beautiful in 

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.467
organic chemistry and one which
few people credited at 

00:46:57.467 --> 00:47:00.233
first, gave great impetus
to chemistry

00:47:00.233 --> 00:47:02.333
and would have been worthy
of any distinction."

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:05.400
So he was nominated,
Gomberg was, for

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.900
the Nobel Prize a number of
times, but he never got it. 

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.667
Now how did he get into this? 

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:15.200
Well, just before he got to
the lab, Thiele, the guy in the

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.000
front row who ultimately drank
himself to death in France,

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.167
had a student named Heuser who
made this compound called 

00:47:25.167 --> 00:47:28.767
AIBN, azoisobutyronitrile. 

00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:31.867
And from it, in 50% yield,
prepared a new 

00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:33.533
carbon-carbon bond. 

00:47:33.533 --> 00:47:37.033
And this is a different way of
making carbon-carbon bonds. 

00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:39.400
The way you do it is to lose
nitrogen. 

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.133
So N2 comes out and the two
radicals come together. 

00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:48.700
So when Gomberg came along into
the lab for just a 

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.567
semester, or maybe two semesters
it was, he said, 

00:47:53.567 --> 00:47:55.733
"Under the sponsorship of
Professor Thiele, I have 

00:47:55.733 --> 00:47:57.333
followed up on these
reactions..."

00:47:57.333 --> 00:48:00.600
So he worked on this compound,
this idea of 

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.167
knocking nitrogen out. 

00:48:02.167 --> 00:48:05.667
And then he went for the third
term to Heidelberg to work 

00:48:05.667 --> 00:48:08.333
with Victor Meyer, who had
introduced the 

00:48:08.333 --> 00:48:09.733
idea of steric hindrance. 

00:48:09.733 --> 00:48:14.367
This was a stressful time to be
in Heidelberg because Meyer 

00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:18.900
committed suicide during this
period. 

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.000
But an interesting question in
steric hindrance was this 

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.567
tetraphenylmethane. 

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.733
Remember, Friedel and Crafts
thought they had made 

00:48:25.733 --> 00:48:28.400
tetraphenylmethane, but in fact
they had made 

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.367
triphenylmethyl chloride because
it's so crowded. 

00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:34.267
So Friedel-Crafts wouldn't make
it. 

00:48:34.267 --> 00:48:38.167
They tried with phenyl anions,
phenyl metal compounds, to 

00:48:38.167 --> 00:48:41.600
make tetraphenyl methane, and
they couldn't do it. 

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.567
So this was a real challenge - a
grand challenge, was how to make

00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:46.900
tetraphenylmethane. 

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.067
Not that anybody thought it
would be good for anything, 

00:48:49.067 --> 00:48:51.967
but it was a symmetrical,
beautiful compound and how do 

00:48:51.967 --> 00:48:53.833
you make it? 

00:48:53.833 --> 00:48:55.867
And Gomberg succeeded. 

00:48:55.867 --> 00:48:58.200
"I have tried to solve this
problem in a completely 

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.300
different way. 

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.767
So the way he used was what he
had learned the previous two 

00:49:02.767 --> 00:49:05.000
terms in Munich. 

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.467
So in Heidelberg, he tried
making this compound, which 

00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:14.400
you get from benzene diazonium
salt and triphenylmethyl 

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.133
chloride, the stuff that
Friedel-Crafts could make. 

00:49:19.133 --> 00:49:22.167
So he tried it to see if it
would work, and at 110 degrees 

00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:25.567
with copper there, from eight
grams of the starting material 

00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:29.233
he got 0.3 grams of this stuff.

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:30.933
How does he know what it was? 

00:49:30.933 --> 00:49:33.800
Well he discusses the
solubility, but that's not a

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.600
very good key to what
the compound is.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.300
But he did the analysis. 

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.533
And this is what he found. 

00:49:41.533 --> 00:49:42.933
And this is the theoretical. 

00:49:42.933 --> 00:49:45.067
So it agreed very well with
that. 

00:49:45.067 --> 00:49:48.900
And what else might you be able
to do? 

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.267
The molecular weight would be
very key. 

00:49:51.267 --> 00:49:53.067
And how do you get the molecular
weight? 

00:49:53.067 --> 00:49:55.033
You can get it from the vapor
density. 

00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.900
But this has very low vapor
pressure. 

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.533
But you can get it by freezing
point lowering. 

00:50:01.533 --> 00:50:05.767
So that's what he did, he tried
freezing point lowering. 

00:50:05.767 --> 00:50:09.000
He had 300 milligrams of this
material and he used 100 

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.900
milligrams for this purpose. 

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.233
And he found that he lowered the
melting 

00:50:13.233 --> 00:50:17.133
point by 0.289 degrees. 

00:50:17.133 --> 00:50:19.167
This is real, careful work. 

00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:23.167
He's being paid off for having
spent nine and a half labs a 

00:50:23.167 --> 00:50:27.533
week for three years at
Michigan. 

00:50:27.533 --> 00:50:29.333
Oh, it's boiling point, not
freezing. 

00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:32.833
The solvent boiling point
elevation, which implied 306 

00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:35.333
for the molecular weight, and he
calculated 320. 

00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:36.600
So very good. 

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.067
So then he went back to
Michigan, to Ann Arbor. 

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:42.500
He stayed there the rest of his
life working at the 

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.867
University of Michigan. 

00:50:43.867 --> 00:50:45.833
And what did he do when he got
back? 

00:50:45.833 --> 00:50:47.100
I'll tell you next time.

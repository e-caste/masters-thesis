00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.055
Professor Shelly Kagan:
All right.

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:05.319
Last time we started asking
ourselves about what are some of

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.930
the other aspects of death that
might contribute to its badness,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.671
or at least other features of
death that are worth thinking

00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:11.875
about.
Conceivably,

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.038
some of them might reduce the
badness of death,

00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:16.909
in some way.
We talked about the

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.434
inevitability of death;
we talked about the

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:24.135
variability, that people have
different lengths of time before

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.041
they die.
And we turned to a discussion

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.934
of the unpredictability of
death, the fact that because we

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:34.145
don't know--we can't
predict--how much more time

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:36.681
we've got,
we may, as it were,

00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.858
pace ourselves incorrectly.
You may take on a long-term

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:45.260
project and then die before
you've been able to complete it;

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.130
or alternatively,
you may peak too soon and then

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.520
continue to stick around in an
anti-climactic way.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.298
These are bads of life that
could presumably be avoided if

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:05.579
only we knew how much exactly we
had--how much longer we had.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.359
On the other hand,
we have to ask ourselves--and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.783
this the question that I left us
with last time--whether it would

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:11.544
really,
all things considered,

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:14.049
be better to know how much time
you had.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.061
After all, if you knew--suppose
we had the birthmarks that told

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.684
you when you were going to
die--if you had that kind of a

00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:24.883
birthmark,
you would face your entire life

00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:28.730
with the burden of knowing,
I've got 48 years left,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.212
47 years left, 50 years left.
I should've been counting

00:01:34.212 --> 00:01:38.900
down--35,30, 25 and so forth.
Many of us would find that was,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.016
as I say, a burden--something
hanging constantly over us

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:46.459
interfering with our ability to
enjoy life.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.323
Suppose that there were some
sort of genetic marker and,

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:52.239
although we didn't have a
tattoo that you would just have

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.408
to look at,
but you could have genetic

00:01:55.408 --> 00:02:00.459
counseling--have your DNA
examined and you could tell,

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.469
if you had the DNA testing,
how much time you had left.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.919
Would you want to get that
testing done?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.391
Now, that's of course science
fiction, and I presume it's

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:15.430
going to stay science
fiction--though we're on the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.964
cusp of having something at
least approximating that as we

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:22.746
learn more and more about the
various genes that carry various

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.607
diseases,
we--more and more of us face

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:29.545
the question of whether or not
we want to get tested for those

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.400
diseases.
Suppose there was a test.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.190
Indeed, one occasionally reads
in the newspaper about this sort

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.530
of thing where you can get
tested for such and such a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.469
disease.
You might know already that

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.697
you've got a 50 percent chance
of having it,

00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:43.340
but you don't know whether you
yourself have it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.751
If you do have it,
the disease will always have

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:49.569
onset by age 40,50 or what have
you.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.720
Would you want to have that
kind of information?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.682
Closely related question.
If you did know how much time

00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:02.799
you had left,
how would you act differently

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.144
from what you're doing now?
Would it focus your attention

00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:12.870
on making sure you did the
things that were most important

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.554
to you?
And it's worth--;it's sort of a

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:19.084
useful test for asking yourself
what are the things you must

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:22.919
value in life--to ask,
what would you choose to do if

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.210
you knew you had five years,
ten years, what have you?

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.641
There's an old Saturday
Night Live routine where one

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:34.849
of the actors is in the doctor's
office,

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.944
and the doctor gives him the
very sad news that he's got two

00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:42.863
minutes left to live.
And he says,

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:47.217
"I'm going to pack a lifetime
of enjoyment into those two

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:49.008
minutes."
And then of course,

00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:51.583
the point of the skit is he
presses the down button on the

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:54.385
elevator and a minute and a half
goes by while he's waiting for

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:58.453
the elevator to come.
If you knew you had a year left

00:03:58.453 --> 00:04:02.653
or two years left,
what would you do with that

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:04.450
time?
Would you be in school?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.594
Would you travel?
Would you spend more time

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:09.638
hanging out with your friends?
A very, for me,

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:14.472
extremely striking example of
this question occurred in this

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:17.574
very class.
There was a student in this

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:20.180
class some years ago who was
dying.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.324
And he knew that he was dying.
He'd been diagnosed with,

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:26.923
if I recall correctly,
cancer as a freshmen--and his

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:30.804
doctor had told him that he
pretty much had no chance of

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:35.180
recovery and indeed had only a
couple more years to live.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.311
Faced with that question,
he had to ask himself,

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.709
"Well, what should I do with my
remaining years?"

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:44.741
It was astonishing enough that
somebody--but perhaps

00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.426
understandable--that somebody in
that situation would decide to

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:51.279
take a class on death and then
have himself,

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.431
submit himself,
to my getting up here week

00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:55.949
after week, talking about how
there's no soul,

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.337
there's no prospect for an
afterlife, it's a good thing

00:04:59.337 --> 00:05:02.577
that we're all going to die.
But faced with the question

00:05:02.577 --> 00:05:05.041
what should he do,
what did he want to do with his

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:08.823
remaining couple of years,
what he decided he wanted to do

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:12.646
was finish his Yale
degree--thought he'd set himself

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:16.319
the goal of graduating college
before he died.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.752
And he was taking this class
second semester of his senior

00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:23.833
year.
At least, he was taking it

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.251
until Spring Break.
By Spring Break he'd gotten

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.618
sufficiently sick that his
doctor basically said,

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.640
"You can't continue in school
anymore.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.286
You've got to go home."
Basically, "You've got to go

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:36.863
home to die."
And indeed, he got

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:41.889
progressively and then rapidly
deteriorated at that point.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.821
The faculty members who were
teaching his classes that

00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.919
semester then all faced the
question posed to them by the

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.415
administration,
based on the work he's done so

00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:55.327
far this semester,
has he--what kind of grade are

00:05:55.327 --> 00:05:59.312
you prepared to give him?
Because, depending on which of

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:02.489
his classes he passed and which
of his classes he failed,

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:05.609
the question was going to
be,was he going to graduate or

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:07.730
not?
In fact, of course,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.492
he did manage to graduate.
And Yale, to its,

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:15.825
I think, real glory and credit
sent a member of the

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:20.850
administration down to his
deathbed to award him his degree

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.226
before he passed away.
So, as I say,

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:27.880
it's a very striking story.
I'm not sure how many of us

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.088
would decide the last thing we
wanted to do with our remaining

00:06:31.088 --> 00:06:34.025
years is to spend it in college.
Well, what is it that

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:37.117
you'd want to do?
And again, to move back and ask

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:40.518
ourselves a larger question,
would knowing how much time you

00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:43.804
have be something that would
allow you to actually embrace

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:47.321
those choices,
or would it instead just be a

00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:49.714
burden?
That's the kind of question we

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:53.337
have to face when we think about
the fact that we don't know how

00:06:53.337 --> 00:06:56.013
much time we've got.
Is that something that

00:06:56.013 --> 00:06:59.212
increases the badness of death,
or does it reduce its

00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:02.959
significance somewhat?
Here's another feature.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.920
In addition to the
inevitability,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.923
in addition to the variability,
in addition to the

00:07:07.923 --> 00:07:11.302
unpredictability,
there's the fact that death is,

00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:14.339
as I like to think of it,
ubiquitous.

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.779
I don't just mean the fact that
people are dying all around us,

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:22.145
but I mean rather,
you yourself could die at any

00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:25.698
time.
There's never any getting away

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:29.769
from the possibility that you'll
die now.

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.792
Even if we didn't have
unpredictability,

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:34.962
I mean rather,
even if we had

00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:38.994
unpredictability,
it wouldn't necessarily follow

00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:42.040
that death was pervasive in this
way.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.368
The point I've got in mind here
is this--even when you think

00:07:45.368 --> 00:07:48.189
you're perfectly safe,
you could of course die of a

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.199
stroke.
You could die of a heart attack.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.480
Even somebody who's young could
have an aneurysm.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.461
Or one of my favorite examples,
you could be sitting in

00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:01.073
your--you read this sort of
thing in the newspaper

00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:05.349
periodically--you could be
sitting in your living room when

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.110
suddenly an airplane crashes
into your house,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.990
killing you.
These sorts of things happen.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.116
You thought you were safe.
You were watching reruns on

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:18.329
television--the next minute,
you're dead.

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:21.978
The fact that you could die and
you don't know when you're going

00:08:21.978 --> 00:08:25.337
to die doesn't yet entail that
you could die at any minute,

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.019
at any moment.
But in fact,

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:31.267
that's true of us as well.
Yet another example close to

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.527
heart.
I remember--before I taught

00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:36.525
here I used to teach at the
University of Illinois at

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.861
Chicago.
And once I was driving down the

00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:44.829
highway and a car pulled in
without looking and clipped my

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:47.168
car,
and caused my car--you know,

00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:50.254
so pulled in from the
entrance--caused my car to go

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:54.389
careening across three lanes of
traffic spinning out of control.

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:56.730
And I remember quite clearly
thinking to myself as that

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.200
happened--the whole thing lasted
only a few moments--but I

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.240
remember thinking quite clearly,
"I'm going to die."

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.950
Now, as it happens,
I didn't die.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.772
I walked away from the
accident, and the damage to my

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:10.345
car was rather minimal.
But it could've have happened

00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:13.474
like that.
Death is--the possibility of

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:16.919
death--is ubiquitous.
It's pervasive.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:21.779
We have to ask ourselves then,
does this make things worse?

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:24.810
It certainly feels,
to my mind, as though it's an

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.210
extra bad about the nature of
death.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.080
It would be nice to get a
breather.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.681
Imagine, if you will,
that there were certain

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:38.510
locations, certain vacation
spots, where as long as you were

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.335
there you couldn't die.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:45.297
to go someplace and just for a
period think to yourself,

00:09:45.297 --> 00:09:47.828
"Well, you know,
right now I don't have to worry

00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:50.058
about that.
It doesn't even have to cross

00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.483
my mind."
Maybe if there were these sort

00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:55.610
of death-free zones,
they'd get rather crowded.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.500
So perhaps we should change the
example.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.509
Instead of having death-free
zones, imagine that there were

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:05.406
death-free times.
Just suppose,

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:10.336
for whatever reason,
nobody could die between twelve

00:10:10.336 --> 00:10:13.252
and one.
You could just put it out of

00:10:13.252 --> 00:10:14.830
your mind.
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.919
All right, one o'clock,
you take the mantle back on.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:23.282
But wouldn't it be nice to just
have a certain period of time

00:10:23.282 --> 00:10:27.717
every day when you didn't have
to even have it be so much as a

00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:31.604
remote possibility?
Or suppose there were certain

00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:35.138
death-free activities.
Maybe reading philosophy would

00:10:35.138 --> 00:10:38.814
be something that as long as you
were doing it you couldn't die

00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:40.575
or,
as perhaps some religious

00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:43.781
traditions might've taught,
as long as you were engaged in

00:10:43.781 --> 00:10:46.340
prayer you couldn't die.
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.720
Or turn the entire thing the
other way around.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:57.057
Suppose that most times and
most activities were death free,

00:10:57.057 --> 00:11:03.276
but certain activities
introduce the possibility of

00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:06.674
dying.
So you couldn't die unless you

00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:09.259
were engaged in certain
activities.

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:12.907
So you would be immortal but
not in the sense of immortal

00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:15.474
against your will.
There'd be certain activities

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.523
perhaps, for example putting a
gun to your head,

00:11:17.523 --> 00:11:19.179
that would put an end to your
life.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.955
So even if immortality would be
bad, there would be certain

00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:25.559
things you could do that could
end it.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:30.626
Ask yourself,
what sorts of activities would

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:37.578
you engage in if you knew that
those activities carried with

00:11:37.578 --> 00:11:43.650
them the risk of dying?
So most of the time you

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.269
couldn't die.
What things would be so

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:52.118
important to you that you'd be
willing to suddenly risk death

00:11:52.118 --> 00:11:55.190
for the sake of doing those
things?

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.193
You like art.
Is art important enough to you

00:11:58.193 --> 00:12:01.409
that you'd be prepared to watch,
look at a masterpiece,

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:04.320
if you knew that while you were
enjoying it you could die,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.210
but that wouldn't happen
otherwise?

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:11.028
Is sex great enough that you'd
be prepared to run the risk of

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:14.080
dying while you were engaged in
sex?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.225
Again, it's a nice lens for
asking yourself,

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:21.029
what are the things that are
most valuable to you?

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:25.230
by asking, which of them are so
valuable you'd be prepared to do

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.763
them even if they would
introduce what isn't otherwise

00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:32.340
there,
namely, the risk of death?

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.700
Now, in the posing the question
that way, I've been assuming

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.004
that these are things you'd do
despite the fact that

00:12:39.004 --> 00:12:42.692
they run the risk of death.
I suppose there's a further

00:12:42.692 --> 00:12:46.538
question we have to ask,
are there things that would be

00:12:46.538 --> 00:12:50.242
worth doing precisely
because of the fact that

00:12:50.242 --> 00:12:53.019
they introduced the risk of
death?

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:56.898
Now, I've got to admit that
when I pose that question,

00:12:56.898 --> 00:13:00.396
that sounds rather bizarre.
At least, putting aside the

00:13:00.396 --> 00:13:03.557
possibility that we've now lived
our hundred thousand years and

00:13:03.557 --> 00:13:06.309
have exhausted all that life's
got to offer for us,

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:09.061
certainly to engage in
activities now,

00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:13.151
while life still has so much
more to offer--to engage in

00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:17.135
activities now where,
precisely for the chance

00:13:17.135 --> 00:13:19.740
of dying, that strikes me as
bizarre.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.588
And yet, it seems to me that
there are many activities,

00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:26.652
and if not many at least
several activities,

00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:29.860
that people do precisely for
that reason.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.295
For example,
let me tell you something I

00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:35.446
know that's going to shock you.
Did you know there are people

00:13:35.446 --> 00:13:39.745
who jump out of airplanes?
Now, admittedly they've got

00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:43.226
this little piece of cloth that
gives them a decent chance of

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:46.590
not killing themselves when they
jump out of airplanes.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.988
But these things do fail.
Every now and then you read in

00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:54.097
the newspaper about somebody
whose parachute failed to open

00:13:54.097 --> 00:13:57.809
and so they died.
And I ask myself, why?

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:01.533
What could possibly drive
somebody to jump out of an

00:14:01.533 --> 00:14:05.622
airplane with nothing but a
little piece of cloth between

00:14:05.622 --> 00:14:09.241
them and death?
And the answer that strikes me

00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:13.109
as most plausible is,
it's the very fact that there's

00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:17.646
a significant chance of death
that helps explain why people do

00:14:17.646 --> 00:14:19.725
this.
Now, I know if you talk to some

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:21.191
of these people,
they'll often say,

00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:22.009
"Oh, no, no,
no.

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.539
The views are so glorious," or
something like that.

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:28.105
But I think this is rather an
implausible suggestion because,

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:31.790
of course, you could have these
glorious views just by going up

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.058
in the airplane and looking down
from the safety of your

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:38.466
airplane.
Part of the thrill has got to

00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:43.760
be--or so it seems to me--part
of the thrill has got to be the

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.879
very fact that they now have an
increased risk of death.

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:53.510
The chance of dying is part of
what drives somebody to jump out

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.365
of an airplane.
Well, if that's right,

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:59.970
then should we say that the
pervasiveness of death,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.718
ubiquitousness of death--the
thing that I was earlier

00:15:03.718 --> 00:15:06.890
suggesting was
oppressive--wouldn't it really

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.215
be nice to have a death-free
time or a death-free location or

00:15:11.215 --> 00:15:14.874
death-free activities?
Maybe I was wrong in suggesting

00:15:14.874 --> 00:15:17.378
that.
If the chance of death would

00:15:17.378 --> 00:15:21.117
add a kind of zest,
then perhaps the ubiquity of

00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:26.289
death is actually a good
thing rather than a bad thing.

00:15:26.289 --> 00:15:30.073
Well, I'm inclined to think,
at least in my own case,

00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:34.480
that that's not right.
And perhaps the explanation has

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.457
got to be the ubiquity of death
is this kind of background,

00:15:39.457 --> 00:15:43.047
constant hum.
And the fact that we're always

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:47.113
facing some risk of death
recedes into the background in

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:51.622
the way that most of us don't
hear background noise--that what

00:15:51.622 --> 00:15:56.279
jumping out of an airplane does
for you is it spikes the risk of

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:58.882
death.
So, it's not really good enough

00:15:58.882 --> 00:16:02.113
to just have some risk of
death--it's got to be greater

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:04.521
risk than usual.
If that's right,

00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:08.902
if that's the psychology,
then even for those death

00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:11.750
thrill seekers,
the ubiquity of death won't

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.480
necessarily be a good thing
because of it being constant.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.740
It just recedes into the
background.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.601
All right.
So again, what I've been asking

00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:24.510
us to think about are various
aspects of death that might

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.837
contribute to either increase or
perhaps in certain ways reduce

00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:33.247
somewhat the badness of death.
There's one more aspect that I

00:16:33.247 --> 00:16:36.788
want to take a couple of minutes
and have us think about,

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.141
and that's this.
Previously to this most recent

00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:43.440
discussion, I talked about the
value of life.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.110
Some rival theories about what
makes life worth living.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.952
And for the last lecture or so
I've been talking about,

00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:53.110
in addition to the deprivation
account,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.525
the additional things that
contribute to the badness of

00:16:57.525 --> 00:16:59.283
death.
So you might think,

00:16:59.283 --> 00:17:02.129
well, what about the human
condition as a whole?

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:04.695
What about the fact that it's
not just that we live,

00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:07.059
or for that matter it's not
just that we die.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:11.328
What's true about humans is
that we live and then we

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.131
die.
That's the human

00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:16.109
condition--life followed by
death.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.609
You might ask,
what's the value of that entire

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.472
combination?
Now, the most natural thing to

00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:28.083
suggest would be,
well, you get clear on your

00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:33.089
favorite theory about the value
of life, whatever that is.

00:17:33.089 --> 00:17:36.289
You get clear about the kinds
of questions we've just been

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:39.319
asking about the badness of
death, whatever that is.

00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:42.799
What's the overall assessment
of the human condition?

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:45.840
You might think,
well, that's just a matter of

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.894
adding up the goodness of life
and subtracting the badness of

00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:52.799
death and summing whatever it
comes to.

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:54.815
I suppose, again,
the optimist says,

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:56.947
"Yeah, death is bad,
but life is good,

00:17:56.947 --> 00:18:00.230
sufficiently good to outweigh
the badness of the fact that

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.485
we're going to die.
On balance, it's a good thing

00:18:03.485 --> 00:18:05.799
to be born."
And pessimists might be those

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:06.730
who say, "No,
no.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.312
On balance, the negative of
death outweighs the

00:18:10.312 --> 00:18:13.669
positive-ness of life."
But I want to pause for a

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:16.884
moment and note that this
assumption that the way to think

00:18:16.884 --> 00:18:19.873
about the value of the
combination as just a matter of

00:18:19.873 --> 00:18:23.257
adding the goodness of life and
the badness of death and just

00:18:23.257 --> 00:18:26.190
summing them that way--that may
not be right.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.752
Because sometimes the value of
a combination is different than

00:18:30.752 --> 00:18:35.314
the value you would get by just
thinking about each one of the

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:38.829
parts in isolation and then
adding them up.

00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:44.649
A kind of addition approach to
values of wholes may not always

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:48.654
be correct.
Here's a nice simple example to

00:18:48.654 --> 00:18:52.892
make that point.
My two favorite foods in the

00:18:52.892 --> 00:18:58.725
world are probably pizza on the
one hand and chocolate on the

00:18:58.725 --> 00:19:00.661
other.
I know I've shared my love of

00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.249
chocolate with you before.
I don't recall having shared my

00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:06.293
love of pizza with you before,
but there it is--two favorite

00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:09.567
things I love--love pizza,
delicious, love chocolate,

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:12.234
delicious.
Take these two delicious things

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:15.260
and combine them into a
chocolate covered pizza.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.111
Oh my God!
The whole idea just sounds

00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:21.164
disgusting.
And it is, I take it,

00:19:21.164 --> 00:19:24.008
disgusting.
But you wouldn't notice the

00:19:24.008 --> 00:19:27.657
disgustingness if you just
thought about the value of pizza

00:19:27.657 --> 00:19:31.180
in isolation and the value of
chocolate in isolation.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.381
The value of chocolate-covered
pizza is not just a matter of

00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:41.230
summing up the value of the
parts taken in isolation.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:46.539
You've got to think about what
we might dub "the interaction

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.862
effects."
So let's ask ourselves,

00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:52.049
are there any interaction
effects when we talk about the

00:19:52.049 --> 00:19:55.119
human condition that it's life
followed by death?"

00:19:55.119 --> 00:19:56.960
We've thought about the value
of life in isolation;

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.780
we've been, in effect,
thinking about the value of

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.613
death in isolation.
Does the fact that death

00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:06.806
follows life--does that produce
any interaction effects between

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:09.624
the two,
which need to be added into our

00:20:09.624 --> 00:20:12.099
formula--added into the mix as
well?

00:20:12.099 --> 00:20:14.490
Well, there's obviously,
I suppose, two possibilities.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.038
Well, really three.
Possibility number one is,

00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:19.874
no it doesn't make any
difference--uninteresting

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:22.217
possibility.
More interestingly--two

00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:25.471
remaining possibilities.
Yeah, there are actually some

00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.619
ways in which the combination
ends up becoming worse.

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:31.178
The interaction effects make
things even worse,

00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:34.460
and we can't overlook those
negative interaction effects.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.409
Also, the possibility that
there might be some

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:39.900
positive interaction
effects.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.931
Let me start briefly by
mentioning a possibility for a

00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:49.901
positive interaction effect.
Because of the fact that you're

00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:51.955
going to die,
obviously enough,

00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:55.720
it's not just that you'll get
whatever life you get,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.346
but there's a finite
amount of life that you're going

00:20:59.346 --> 00:21:02.830
to get.
Life is a scarce resource.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:08.900
It's precious.
And we might be attracted to

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.950
the thought that the value of
life is increased by its very

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.711
preciousness.
There's a kind of aspect of

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:23.438
value for many of us where we
feel that something's especially

00:21:23.438 --> 00:21:27.435
valuable if it won't endure,
if it's fragile,

00:21:27.435 --> 00:21:31.203
or if it's rare.
This can enhance the value of

00:21:31.203 --> 00:21:33.756
something.
And so, arguably,

00:21:33.756 --> 00:21:39.158
the fact that life is precious,
that it won't endure,

00:21:39.158 --> 00:21:43.730
could actually increase its
value for us.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:49.040
There's a short story by the
science fiction writer Orson

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.351
Scott Card, where the basic
point of the story is that of

00:21:54.351 --> 00:21:58.049
all the life forms in the
universe,

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:02.333
we, here on Earth,
are the only ones that are

00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:06.617
mortal.
And because of this we are the

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:10.480
envy of the rest of the
universe.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.423
It's not so much that
immortality, what the rest of

00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:15.720
them have, is unattractive or
boring.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.671
It's perfectly fine,
but they envy us for our finite

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:23.932
lifespans, because what we've
got and they don't have is

00:22:23.932 --> 00:22:27.883
something that's for each
individual rare--something

00:22:27.883 --> 00:22:31.964
that's not lasting,
something that's precious in

00:22:31.964 --> 00:22:34.579
that way.
All right, it's a possibility.

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:39.687
So, it's possible that the very
fact that we're going to die

00:22:39.687 --> 00:22:44.448
causes an interaction effect
with our life so there's an

00:22:44.448 --> 00:22:48.381
upside to it.
It makes our life fragile,

00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:53.210
ephemeral, and as a result of
that, more precious.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.959
But it's also
possible--actually compatible

00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:57.000
with accepting that fact--there
are two additional

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.386
possibilities,
that there might be some

00:22:59.386 --> 00:23:01.910
negative interaction
effects.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.873
It could be that in thinking
about the nature of the

00:23:04.873 --> 00:23:07.894
combination we're led to see
that in certain ways the

00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:11.090
combination--the interaction
effects--are negative,

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.988
are bad ones.
Well, here are two

00:23:13.988 --> 00:23:19.831
possibilities for that thought.
First possibility I think of

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:24.799
under the heading "A Taste is
Just a Tease."

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:29.677
It's as though we live life for
a while, getting a feel for all

00:23:29.677 --> 00:23:33.059
the wonderful things life could
offer us,

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:38.088
and then a moment later,
as it were, it's snatched away

00:23:38.088 --> 00:23:41.377
from us.
It's sort of adding insult to

00:23:41.377 --> 00:23:44.630
injury that we're offered just a
whiff.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.738
It's as though somebody brought
in this delicious meal to a

00:23:48.738 --> 00:23:52.634
hungry--before a hungry
person--allowed them to see what

00:23:52.634 --> 00:23:55.664
it looked like,
allowed them to smell the

00:23:55.664 --> 00:23:58.562
delicious aromas,
perhaps gave them just one

00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:02.606
little tiny forkful to see just
how beautifully delicious the

00:24:02.606 --> 00:24:05.494
food was.
And then they snatched the

00:24:05.494 --> 00:24:09.126
whole thing away.
You can imagine somebody who

00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:14.108
says, "Look, it would be better
never to have had the taste at

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:19.089
all than to have the taste and
then not be allowed to have the

00:24:19.089 --> 00:24:22.382
entire meal."
That's something that you might

00:24:22.382 --> 00:24:25.791
not notice if you just focus on
the intrinsic nature of the

00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:27.789
taste.
After all, the intrinsic nature

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:30.646
of the taste was positive.
Or, if you just focused on the

00:24:30.646 --> 00:24:33.170
intrinsic character of the
not-having the meal.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.566
After all, not having the meal
is just an absence of a certain

00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:38.704
experience.
To capture what's

00:24:38.704 --> 00:24:44.027
excruciatingly undesirable about
the two, you need to think about

00:24:44.027 --> 00:24:48.960
the two in combination.
It's an interaction effect.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.658
And we might think,
look, this is one of the

00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:55.612
negative things about the human
condition that we get a taste of

00:24:55.612 --> 00:24:58.750
life--nothing more--before it's
snatched away.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.166
That's one possibility.
The second possible thought

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:04.124
that comes to mind for me,
in thinking about the negative

00:25:04.124 --> 00:25:07.752
interaction effects,
I call under the title--I think

00:25:07.752 --> 00:25:11.799
about under the title--"How the
Noble Have Fallen."

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:16.160
Right now, there's something
amazing about us.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.718
We are people.
In the universe we--Who knows

00:25:22.718 --> 00:25:26.923
what is out there in the
universe but at least on Earth

00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:30.350
we may well be the only people
there are.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.681
Now, who knows?
Maybe dolphins or certain--some

00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:36.666
of the great apes.
But at any rate,

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:40.582
it's a rather select club.
We are, as I said,

00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:43.562
early in the semester when I
said I'm a physicalist,

00:25:43.562 --> 00:25:47.186
I believe that people are just
machines, but we're not just any

00:25:47.186 --> 00:25:50.610
old machine.
We're amazing machines.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.329
We're able to love.
We're able to write poetry.

00:25:54.329 --> 00:25:58.507
We're able to think about the
farthest reaches of the universe

00:25:58.507 --> 00:26:01.520
and ask what our place is in the
universe.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:08.240
People are amazing.
And we end up rotting.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:15.134
We end up corpses.
There's something--For many of

00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:20.883
us, there's something horrifying
about the thought that something

00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:25.391
as amazing as us,
as exalted and valuable as us,

00:26:25.391 --> 00:26:30.813
could end up something as lowly
and unimportant as a piece of

00:26:30.813 --> 00:26:37.039
rotting flesh.
Again, think about it.

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:41.338
The image here that comes to
mind for me is one of these

00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:45.402
deposed kings who ends up
waiting on tables to make a

00:26:45.402 --> 00:26:48.452
living in New York.
And it's--you might think,

00:26:48.452 --> 00:26:50.606
"All right.
The life of a waiter is not the

00:26:50.606 --> 00:26:53.306
worst thing in the world."
But there's extra,

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:56.843
again, insult to injury,
when the person's got to

00:26:56.843 --> 00:27:00.602
remember that he used to be
something extraordinary,

00:27:00.602 --> 00:27:02.751
a ruler.
Again, if you just thought

00:27:02.751 --> 00:27:05.179
about life as a ruler,
well pretty good thinking about

00:27:05.179 --> 00:27:07.344
it in isolation.
Life as a waiter,

00:27:07.344 --> 00:27:10.619
not so bad thinking about it in
isolation.

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:13.955
To see the nature of the
problem you've got to think

00:27:13.955 --> 00:27:17.160
about the fact that it's a
combination package.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.070
There is something especially
insulting about having gone from

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.710
king to waiter.
How the mighty have fallen.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:29.309
And that fate is waiting for
all of us.

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:33.303
It's a fact about the human
condition that the amazing

00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:35.940
things we are don't stay
amazing.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.650
We turn into pieces of rotting
flesh, decaying.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.309
So two possible negative
effects--the taste is just a

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:49.250
tease, the how the noble have
fallen--on the one hand.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:54.519
One possible positive effect,
the extra preciousness of life.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:58.736
I'm not quite sure where,
on balance, we should say how

00:27:58.736 --> 00:28:02.575
these things play out.
Again, I suppose we could have

00:28:02.575 --> 00:28:05.177
different views.
On the one hand,

00:28:05.177 --> 00:28:09.824
the optimists might say,
"Even when we throw in the

00:28:09.824 --> 00:28:15.207
extra interaction effects,
even the negative interaction

00:28:15.207 --> 00:28:21.140
effects, the overall nature of
the human condition is positive.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.546
So that it's a good thing to be
born, even though your life is

00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:29.151
going to be followed by death."
And against that,

00:28:29.151 --> 00:28:33.173
we could have the pessimists
who say, "The negative side,

00:28:33.173 --> 00:28:37.769
especially once we throw in the
negative interaction effects,

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:43.777
the negative side is so great
that it would be better never to

00:28:43.777 --> 00:28:47.759
have been born at all."
That's the pessimist view.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:53.526
Given that we're going to die,
this fact seeps back in and

00:28:53.526 --> 00:28:59.393
poisons the nature of life or
perhaps poisons the nature of

00:28:59.393 --> 00:29:02.393
the whole,
life followed by death,

00:29:02.393 --> 00:29:05.630
so that on balance the whole
thing's negative.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.493
Better to have not had any of
it, better to have not been born

00:29:09.493 --> 00:29:13.899
at all, say the pessimists,
than to have this combination

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:17.000
package of life followed by
death.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.700
Now, for myself,
I'm sufficiently optimistic

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.589
that I'm inclined to think
life's wonderful.

00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:25.648
The negative combination
effects that I was talking about

00:29:25.648 --> 00:29:28.128
are certainly there,
but on balance I think the

00:29:28.128 --> 00:29:30.390
human condition for must of us
is a good one.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.625
It's better to have been born
than never to--even though

00:29:33.625 --> 00:29:37.390
that's followed by death--than
never to have been born at all.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.036
But I do want to emphasize the
point that even if we were to

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:44.064
accept the pessimist's
conclusion that it would be

00:29:44.064 --> 00:29:46.660
better never to have been born
at all,

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.663
it doesn't follow,
at least doesn't follow without

00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:52.544
further argument,
that the right response to the

00:29:52.544 --> 00:29:55.732
realization--if it is the
correct realization that it

00:29:55.732 --> 00:29:59.471
would be better never to have
been born at all--doesn't follow

00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.720
that the right response is to
commit suicide.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.527
It's a tempting thought right?
To go philosophically from

00:30:05.527 --> 00:30:08.759
life's so bad given the nature
of the human condition,

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:11.801
life followed by death,
that better to never have had

00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:15.135
any of it than to have just had
a taste and a tease and so

00:30:15.135 --> 00:30:16.646
forth.
But it's a tempting

00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:19.424
philosophical thought to say,
"Once I've shown it's better

00:30:19.424 --> 00:30:22.517
never to have been born,
it follows that suicide is the

00:30:22.517 --> 00:30:24.658
appropriate response."
But in fact,

00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:27.900
as a matter of logic,
that doesn't follow at all.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.682
Because if you think about it,
suicide doesn't change the

00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:37.635
fundamental nature of the human
condition, life followed by

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:40.195
death.
It's not as though if you kill

00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:43.437
yourself you somehow bring it
about that you've never been

00:30:43.437 --> 00:30:45.875
born at all.
It's still the case that if

00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:49.400
there's something horrible about
having just a taste--well,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.248
indeed, if you commit suicide
you've made it an even shorter

00:30:53.248 --> 00:30:55.844
taste.
If there's something sort of

00:30:55.844 --> 00:31:00.511
degrading or unnoble about being
a person who is going to become

00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:02.947
a corpse,
committing suicide doesn't

00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:05.089
alter that fundamental fact
either.

00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:08.680
It just makes the insult come
sooner.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.286
So, even if we were to agree
with the pessimists that it

00:31:12.286 --> 00:31:15.500
would be better never to have
been born at all,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.105
as the old joke goes,
show me one person in a

00:31:19.105 --> 00:31:21.810
thousand who's so lucky,
right?

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.618
We have all been born.
And from the fact,

00:31:25.618 --> 00:31:28.898
even if we were to agree with
it, that it would've been better

00:31:28.898 --> 00:31:32.018
if we hadn't been born--instead
of feeling sorry for unborn

00:31:32.018 --> 00:31:34.201
Larry,
perhaps we should envy

00:31:34.201 --> 00:31:36.973
unborn Larry;
that's what the pessimists

00:31:36.973 --> 00:31:41.520
say--even if that were true,
it wouldn't follow that suicide

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.710
was an appropriate response.
It doesn't mean of course that

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.349
suicide isn't ever an
appropriate response.

00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:51.417
We're coming on toward the end
of the semester,

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:55.019
and the last topic we'll be
talking about is indeed the

00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:57.756
topic of suicide.
When, if ever,

00:31:57.756 --> 00:32:03.006
is suicide an appropriate,
rational or moral response to

00:32:03.006 --> 00:32:06.622
one's situation?
Let's hold off on thinking

00:32:06.622 --> 00:32:09.049
about that question a bit
further.

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:11.875
Before we get to suicide,
you might say,

00:32:11.875 --> 00:32:16.076
the question that's going to
entertain us for the remaining

00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:19.292
few weeks is this.
How should one live,

00:32:19.292 --> 00:32:23.998
in light of the facts about
death that I've been laying out

00:32:23.998 --> 00:32:26.920
in the semester up to this
point?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.884
How should we live,
in light of the facts about

00:32:29.884 --> 00:32:31.994
death?
And one possible response,

00:32:31.994 --> 00:32:34.876
the last one we'll look at,
is, what you should,

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:37.330
at least sometimes,
is kill yourself.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:41.032
We'll come to that.
We're going to spend the next

00:32:41.032 --> 00:32:43.739
couple of weeks asking ourselves
different aspects of the

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:46.913
question,
what should our response be to

00:32:46.913 --> 00:32:52.013
the fact of our death and the
specific features of death and

00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:56.250
the nature of death that we've
been exploring?

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.968
But the very first question I
suppose we really need to ask is

00:33:00.968 --> 00:33:04.511
this.
Should we be thinking about all

00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:07.908
this at all?
Well, I realize that for you

00:33:07.908 --> 00:33:09.970
guys it's too late,
right?

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.713
It's sort of late in the day
for students who have been

00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:15.506
through the better part of a
semester thinking about the

00:33:15.506 --> 00:33:18.422
nature of death to argue,
maybe, it wasn't such a good

00:33:18.422 --> 00:33:21.099
idea for you to take this class
in the first place.

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:24.310
But as theorists,
we could be interested in the

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.637
theoretical possibility that the
right response is to not think

00:33:28.637 --> 00:33:34.794
about the facts of death at all.
Look, in principle I suppose

00:33:34.794 --> 00:33:39.609
there are three different
reactions.

00:33:39.609 --> 00:33:43.204
So, I make various claims of
the sort that I've been making

00:33:43.204 --> 00:33:46.116
about, "Well look,
you know, we're just physical

00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:48.894
objects.
When these objects break,

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:52.350
we cease to exist.
The objects don't get put back

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.579
together," and so forth and so
on.

00:33:54.579 --> 00:33:57.367
One possibility,
of course, is simply to

00:33:57.367 --> 00:33:59.869
disagree with me about the
facts.

00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:02.934
And so you--of course,
if you do disagree I think

00:34:02.934 --> 00:34:05.934
you're mistaken,
so I'll think of you as denying

00:34:05.934 --> 00:34:09.190
the facts, but all right,
that's a possibility.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.668
Another possibility,
the one I'll turn to a little

00:34:12.668 --> 00:34:16.429
bit later, is admit the facts
and live accordingly.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.980
Of course, we haven't yet asked
ourselves, how should you

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.250
live if you recognize and take
into account those facts?

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.619
That's the question we'll turn
to.

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:28.614
But there's the middle
possibility, which is not so

00:34:28.614 --> 00:34:31.650
much think about them and deny
them,

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.485
not so much think about them,
accept them and act

00:34:35.485 --> 00:34:39.400
accordingly, but simply don't
think about them.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.626
Maybe the best response to the
facts of death is just put it

00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:47.319
out of your mind.
Don't give it any thought at

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:47.500
all.

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:56.183
Now, on the one hand you might
think, that can't possibly be

00:34:56.183 --> 00:35:00.280
the right response,
the appropriate response.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.544
After all, how can it be
appropriate to disregard,

00:35:05.544 --> 00:35:09.090
to put out of your mind,
facts?

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.720
Well, that all sounds very
nice, but I think that claim has

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.036
got to just be mistaken.
There's nothing unacceptable or

00:35:15.036 --> 00:35:19.378
inappropriate or misguided about
not thinking about all sorts of

00:35:19.378 --> 00:35:23.031
facts that you might have
learned at some point or the

00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:25.931
other.
Here's my favorite example of

00:35:25.931 --> 00:35:30.287
stupid facts I was forced to
learn when I was younger--state

00:35:30.287 --> 00:35:34.075
capitals, right?
I've gotten pretty far in my

00:35:34.075 --> 00:35:38.079
life, and as far as I can tell
I've never, ever,

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:42.680
ever had to remember the
capitals of the 50 states.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.971
So, I just don't think about it.
Pretty much I think about it

00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:49.434
only once a year,
when I'm giving this very

00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:50.712
lecture.
I start asking,

00:35:50.712 --> 00:35:52.400
how many state capitals can I
remember?

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.052
And the answer is,
really not all that many of

00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:56.763
them.
Not thinking about those facts

00:35:56.763 --> 00:36:01.590
that I knew at one point--just
not all that objectionable.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.503
So, the mere fact,
if it is a fact,

00:36:03.503 --> 00:36:06.823
suppose the facts about life
and death are as I've described

00:36:06.823 --> 00:36:08.640
them.
Until we say something more,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.371
it's not clear that we
shouldn't just,

00:36:10.371 --> 00:36:12.347
all right,
note it, store it away,

00:36:12.347 --> 00:36:15.260
and forget about it,
just like the facts about the

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.050
state capitals.
That seems odd;

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.369
that seems misguided.
But why?

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:25.312
What is it about the facts
about life and death that seem

00:36:25.312 --> 00:36:29.678
to make it misguided to think we
should just put them aside and

00:36:29.678 --> 00:36:33.763
pay no attention to them?
Presumably because we're led to

00:36:33.763 --> 00:36:36.730
the thought, we're attracted to
the thought,

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:42.287
that the nature of death,
the facts about death--whatever

00:36:42.287 --> 00:36:47.150
they are--should have an impact
on how we live.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:52.556
The appropriate way to live
gets shaped, at least in part,

00:36:52.556 --> 00:36:58.151
by the fact that we're going to
die, that we won't be around

00:36:58.151 --> 00:37:00.480
forever.
If that's right,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.796
then it seems as though there'd
be something irrational and

00:37:04.796 --> 00:37:08.889
inappropriate about simply
disregarding those facts.

00:37:08.889 --> 00:37:12.363
Let me tell you two stories
that might--well,

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:17.099
look, before I tell you the
stories here's the other side.

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:21.347
Suppose somebody said,
"Yeah, it's true if I thought

00:37:21.347 --> 00:37:25.497
about the nature of death,
the fact that the 50,80,

00:37:25.497 --> 00:37:29.889
90 years I've got on this Earth
is all I'm going to have.

00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:35.420
If I thought about that fact,
it would just be overwhelming.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.367
It would be crushing.
I'd be unable to go on with my

00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:43.259
life."
People sometimes claim that

00:37:43.259 --> 00:37:46.286
that's the case and,
because of that,

00:37:46.286 --> 00:37:50.489
the right thing to do is to not
think about it.

00:37:50.489 --> 00:37:54.904
You've read at this point,
long since, Tolstoy's Death

00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:59.792
of Ivan Ilych. The people in
the Tolstoy story seem to have

00:37:59.792 --> 00:38:03.340
put facts of mortality out of
their mind.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.967
Why?
Presumably because they think

00:38:05.967 --> 00:38:09.929
that facing it is just too
crushing and overwhelming.

00:38:09.929 --> 00:38:14.377
So the way they cope with
it--they think the appropriate

00:38:14.377 --> 00:38:18.421
response is put it aside,
disregard the facts about

00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.271
death.
Well, as I say,

00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:24.090
there seems to be something
amiss about that reaction.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.451
That was certainly the point
that Tolstoy was trying to get

00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:29.010
us to see.
There's something wrong about

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.865
lives, something inauthentic
about lives that are lived

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:36.506
without facing the facts of our
mortality and living

00:38:36.506 --> 00:38:39.639
accordingly,
whatever the appropriate

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:43.565
responses might be.
Here are two stories not having

00:38:43.565 --> 00:38:47.914
to do with death per se that may
help us get a feel for the

00:38:47.914 --> 00:38:51.289
oddity of trying to disregard
these facts.

00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:55.571
Suppose that you're on a hot
date, or about to go out on a

00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:59.928
hot date, with Peggy Sue or,
depending on your preferences,

00:38:59.928 --> 00:39:04.039
Billy Bob.
And your roommate holds up an

00:39:04.039 --> 00:39:08.997
envelope and says,
"Written in this envelope are

00:39:08.997 --> 00:39:13.849
certain facts about Peggy Sue or
Billy Bob.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:16.750
I'm not going to tell you what
these facts are yet.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.869
They're in the envelope.
But I'll give you the envelope

00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:21.250
and you can open it up and read
them.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.409
But I do want to tell you this
one thing.

00:39:24.409 --> 00:39:28.417
It is indeed the case that if
you were to read these facts,

00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:31.250
if you were to think about
these facts,

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.064
if you were to know the things
written down in the envelope,

00:39:36.064 --> 00:39:39.900
you would not want to go out
with Peggy Sue."

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.559
And you say to yourself,
well, let's see.

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:44.506
Right now I want to go out with
Peggy Sue, but if I knew these

00:39:44.506 --> 00:39:47.307
true--It's not that you think,
oh your roommate has made it

00:39:47.307 --> 00:39:49.670
up, that these are lies;
these are slander.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.749
You really believe,
and it is in fact the case that

00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:55.889
the things written down in the
envelope are true.

00:39:55.889 --> 00:39:59.090
And so you know that if only
you were to read these things in

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.383
the envelope,
you would change your mind and

00:40:01.383 --> 00:40:03.409
no longer want to go out with
her.

00:40:03.409 --> 00:40:07.110
And so what you say is,
"Don't show me the envelope."

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:11.902
That seems odd.
It doesn't seem like it makes

00:40:11.902 --> 00:40:13.855
sense.
If there are things that would

00:40:13.855 --> 00:40:16.632
change your mind and you know
that they would change your mind

00:40:16.632 --> 00:40:20.283
about your behavior,
how can it be rational to

00:40:20.283 --> 00:40:24.750
disregard them?
Here's another story.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.635
You're about to drink a
milkshake, and your roommate

00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:32.750
comes rushing in and says,
"I've got the lab report.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.992
I had my suspicions about the
milkshake, and so I took a

00:40:35.992 --> 00:40:38.410
sample and I rushed it down to
the lab.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.722
I've got the lab report."
You're about to drink it,

00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:42.580
right, because you're thirsty,
it's a hot day,

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.985
you love milkshakes.
And your roommate says,

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:48.846
"Inside the envelope are facts
about this milkshake that if--I

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:52.769
promise you it is indeed the
case--if you knew these facts,

00:40:52.769 --> 00:40:55.130
you would not drink the
milkshake anymore."

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.352
And you say, "Oh, thank God.
Don't open the envelope," and

00:40:58.352 --> 00:41:01.940
you drink the milkshake,
disregarding the facts.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:09.115
That seems inappropriate.
Well, if it really was true

00:41:09.115 --> 00:41:15.617
then that if only we faced the
facts about our mortality that

00:41:15.617 --> 00:41:20.059
we would live life rather
differently,

00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:24.090
how could it be reasonable for
us to disregard those facts?

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.263
Well, that's the puzzle.
Or maybe we shouldn't call it a

00:41:31.263 --> 00:41:33.415
puzzle at all.
Maybe the answer is,

00:41:33.415 --> 00:41:37.462
that just shows the disregard
option is not really all that

00:41:37.462 --> 00:41:39.860
reputable.
What we either have to do is

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.630
deny the claims I'm made about
the nature of death,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:46.532
or else go on to ask--supposing
they are true--how should we

00:41:46.532 --> 00:41:50.537
live in light of them?
Maybe the disregard option just

00:41:50.537 --> 00:41:54.982
is one that we can't actually
take on as an intellectually

00:41:54.982 --> 00:41:59.032
acceptable alternative.
But I suspect that that's

00:41:59.032 --> 00:42:03.885
probably a little bit too quick,
because really there are two

00:42:03.885 --> 00:42:08.900
different ways in which facts
could influence our behavior.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.473
And if we're not careful we'll
disregard this distinction,

00:42:11.473 --> 00:42:13.460
even though I think it's an
important one.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.706
Here's the two ways.
On the one hand,

00:42:16.706 --> 00:42:21.793
it could be that certain facts,
if you knew them,

00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:27.199
would cause you to
behave differently without

00:42:27.199 --> 00:42:32.076
actually giving you any
reason to behave

00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:36.900
differently.
That's possibility number one.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:43.056
Possibility number two is the
facts change your behavior by

00:42:43.056 --> 00:42:48.469
giving you a reason to
behave differently.

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:51.026
Let me show you an example of
the first possibility,

00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:53.983
because that's the one I think
we may be overlooking when we

00:42:53.983 --> 00:42:56.739
assume that disregarding can't
ever make any sense.

00:42:56.739 --> 00:43:00.774
So, there you are kissing,
making out with Peggy Sue or

00:43:00.774 --> 00:43:04.957
Billy Bob--whoever it is--and
your roommate bursts in and

00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:07.759
says,
"I have in the envelope certain

00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:11.812
facts such that if you were to
think about them you would no

00:43:11.812 --> 00:43:17.260
longer want to kiss Peggy Sue,
Billy Bob."

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.489
Let me just tell you what the
facts in the envelope are.

00:43:19.489 --> 00:43:23.253
They're certain facts about the
nature of Peggy Sue's digestive

00:43:23.253 --> 00:43:25.042
system.
Now, well, you're making out

00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:27.438
after having had dinner,
and while you're sitting there

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:30.952
making out,
food is making its way down

00:43:30.952 --> 00:43:36.630
Peggy Sue's digestive tract,
being turned into shit.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.690
And eventually it's going to be
excreted.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:44.443
And if you started picturing to
yourself the feces inside Peggy

00:43:44.443 --> 00:43:48.106
Sue's digestive tract,
and the fact that she's

00:43:48.106 --> 00:43:51.789
eventually going to be wiping
the feces off of her behind,

00:43:51.789 --> 00:43:55.761
you might find it difficult to
continue to engage in making out

00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:58.289
with Peggy Sue.
It's not so--now these are just

00:43:58.289 --> 00:44:00.451
facts, right?
I didn't make any of these up,

00:44:00.451 --> 00:44:02.669
but there you are,
as I'm talking about them,

00:44:02.669 --> 00:44:05.289
you're just being grossed out
as I describe them.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:09.970
Now, do any of these facts
about the digestive system make

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.830
it inappropriate to kiss another
human being?

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.640
Well, of course not.
But for all that,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.931
thinking about those facts make
it rather difficult,

00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:25.810
while you're thinking about the
facts, to continue enjoying

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:30.106
kissing the person.
So there are certain facts

00:44:30.106 --> 00:44:35.535
about the digestive tract such
that if you think about them you

00:44:35.535 --> 00:44:38.949
can't do something,
kiss the person.

00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:41.376
But for all that,
it's not because you've got any

00:44:41.376 --> 00:44:43.599
good reason not to kiss
the person.

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:47.287
It's not that the facts about
the human digestive process give

00:44:47.287 --> 00:44:51.519
you reason not to kiss her.
They cause you to change

00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:56.559
you behavior without giving you
any reason to change your

00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:58.680
behavior.
So, when the roommate comes

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.484
running in, holding the
envelope, and says,

00:45:00.484 --> 00:45:02.804
"I have in this envelope
certain facts such that if you

00:45:02.804 --> 00:45:05.337
read these facts,
and thought about these facts,

00:45:05.337 --> 00:45:08.460
you would stop kissing this
person," the question you should

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.401
put to your roommate is,
"Are these facts that would

00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:16.960
merely cause me to change
what I'm doing,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.994
or are these facts things that
would give me some good

00:45:19.994 --> 00:45:23.042
reason to change?"
If these are facts about how

00:45:23.042 --> 00:45:26.047
Peggy Sue likes to kiss and
tell, or then goes around and

00:45:26.047 --> 00:45:29.159
talks about who's a good kisser
and who's a bad kisser,

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:32.449
maybe that gives you a reason
to not continue what you're

00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:34.426
doing.
So the facts could be things

00:45:34.426 --> 00:45:36.954
that would give you
reason to change your

00:45:36.954 --> 00:45:39.331
behavior.
But the mere fact that they

00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:42.731
would change your
behavior doesn't yet tell you

00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:45.489
whether they're
reason-generating facts.

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:49.858
If they're mere causes and not
reasons, then maybe it's

00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:52.690
perfectly okay to disregard
them.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.263
If your roommate comes in and
starts trying to tell you facts

00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:58.706
about the human digestive
system, you say,

00:45:58.706 --> 00:46:01.425
"Not now."
Disregarding is sometimes the

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.050
appropriate thing to do.

00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:08.989
Well, what about the facts
about death?

00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:15.380
Are the facts about death
things that it's appropriate to

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:20.659
disregard?
A bold claim would say, "Yes."

00:46:20.659 --> 00:46:24.917
A bold claim would say,
"The facts about death,

00:46:24.917 --> 00:46:29.730
if I thought about them,
would change my behavior,

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:33.105
but not because it would give
me a reason to change my

00:46:33.105 --> 00:46:36.418
behavior--simply because it
would influence my

00:46:36.418 --> 00:46:38.244
behavior."
And, given that,

00:46:38.244 --> 00:46:40.929
we might say,
better to not think about them.

00:46:40.929 --> 00:46:45.150
That would be the bold claim to
make at this point.

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.395
Suppose, for example,
that, the right way to live,

00:46:48.395 --> 00:46:52.105
in light of the facts about
death, is to live life to the

00:46:52.105 --> 00:46:54.699
fullest.
But suppose if you think about

00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:58.420
death you just get too depressed
and you can't live life to the

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.035
fullest.
It's not that the facts about

00:47:01.035 --> 00:47:04.610
death give you reason to stay in
your room and sulk.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:08.352
It's just that the facts about
death cause you to stay

00:47:08.352 --> 00:47:11.803
in your room and sulk.
If that was the case,

00:47:11.803 --> 00:47:15.337
then disregarding,
always disregarding,

00:47:15.337 --> 00:47:19.987
the facts about death might
well be the appropriate

00:47:19.987 --> 00:47:22.389
response.
Well, that would be a rather

00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:24.982
bold claim.
I'm not inclined to believe

00:47:24.982 --> 00:47:28.760
that the bold claim is right.
Should we conclude therefore

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.803
that, no, you should always be
thinking about the facts about

00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:34.151
death?
No, I'm inclined to think that

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.672
that other bold claim,
on the other side,

00:47:36.672 --> 00:47:39.775
is probably mistaken as well.
So there you are,

00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:41.563
one more time,
one last time,

00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:45.075
making out with Peggy Sue or
Billy Bob and your roommate

00:47:45.075 --> 00:47:48.715
comes in and starts trying to
tell you about the fact that

00:47:48.715 --> 00:47:52.610
he's taken Shelly Kagan's class
on death or he's been studying

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:57.458
in some biology class,
and he wants to tell you about

00:47:57.458 --> 00:48:02.429
how human bodies decay when they
turn into corpses.

00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:07.723
As he begins to tell you this
story, you start picturing Peggy

00:48:07.723 --> 00:48:11.339
Sue as a rotting corpse.
Suddenly, you don't really feel

00:48:11.339 --> 00:48:14.142
like kissing her anymore.
It's sort of like the digestive

00:48:14.142 --> 00:48:15.817
tract story.
It's not that,

00:48:15.817 --> 00:48:19.379
as far as I can see,
the fact that she's going to be

00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:23.289
a corpse gives you any
reason not to kiss her.

00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:27.567
It's just that thinking about
the fact that she's going to be

00:48:27.567 --> 00:48:31.132
a corpse causes you to
not want to kiss her,

00:48:31.132 --> 00:48:33.769
not be able to enjoy kissing
her.

00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:38.031
So, I'm inclined to think that
the right position here is a

00:48:38.031 --> 00:48:40.750
kind of moderate one,
a modest one.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:46.563
There are times and places for
thinking about the facts of

00:48:46.563 --> 00:48:48.961
death.
When you're kissing

00:48:48.961 --> 00:48:53.789
somebody--that is not the time
and that is not the place.

00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:58.130
The position that says,
you should always have the fact

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:03.194
of your mortality forever before
your mind's eye--I think that's

00:49:03.194 --> 00:49:05.613
misguided.
Similarly, though,

00:49:05.613 --> 00:49:08.845
anybody who says,
you should never think about

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:13.227
the facts of mortality and the
nature of death--I think that's

00:49:13.227 --> 00:49:18.610
misguided as well.
There's a time and place.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.260
But that still leaves us with
the question.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.989
All right, so suppose this is
the time and place.

00:49:23.989 --> 00:49:26.828
If ever there was a time and
place for thinking about the

00:49:26.828 --> 00:49:29.412
facts of death and how it should
influence our life,

00:49:29.412 --> 00:49:31.440
it's right now,
in a class on death.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.559
So, we still have to face the
question, how should you live?

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:42.022
What is the appropriate
response to the facts about life

00:49:42.022 --> 00:49:45.480
and death?
That's the question we have to

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.746
turn to next time.

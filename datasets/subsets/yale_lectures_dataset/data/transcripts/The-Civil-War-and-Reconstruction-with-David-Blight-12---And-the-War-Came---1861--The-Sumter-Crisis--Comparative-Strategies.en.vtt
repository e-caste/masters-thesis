00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.004
Professor David Blight:
I suppose every war,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.640
the short ones and the long
ones,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.214
the ones that get televised and
the ones that don't,

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:27.278
the ones where we get to see
the coffins and the ones where

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:33.721
we don't,
have their romance and their

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.638
reality.
It seems to be an endless--in

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:43.184
the face of whatever,
modernization of war,

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:49.051
media coverage of war,
the devastating critique of war

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:54.048
as an individual human
experience by so many great

00:00:54.048 --> 00:01:00.268
poets and writers for a century
and a half--it doesn't seem to

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:04.450
matter what changes or what
happens,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.990
but youth grow up to be excited
about war.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.823
Ambrose Bierce once wrote that
only--I quote him--"Only fools

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:23.111
forget the causes of war."
But then it's the same Ambrose

00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:25.787
Bierce, one of the
most--certainly I think,

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:29.355
the unique American writer
about the Civil War in so many

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.941
ways--a kind of bitter,
brutal realist who was wounded

00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:38.705
three times in the war,
hit in the head with a shell

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:43.171
shot from a cannon,
should've died--crushed in part

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.127
of his skull,
which may explain Ambrose

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:50.638
Bierce actually--but it's Bierce
who also wrote that lovely

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:55.614
little line where he said,
"the soil of peace is thickly

00:01:55.614 --> 00:02:02.234
sewn with the seeds of war."
Get too much peace for awhile

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:07.961
and people get anxious.
Americans, when this war broke

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:12.310
out, embraced it with a fever,
that is, an enthusiasm,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:20.872
an almost indefinable joy,
that may be a little tough to

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:27.970
understand today or appreciate.
It's only in the wake of war,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.553
or in the face of real war,
of course, that people get

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:35.130
reflective.
At the end of it all,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.020
in Lincoln's Second Inaugural,
is this famous passage;

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.904
and by the way,
there may be more book titles

00:02:44.904 --> 00:02:48.968
drawn from this one page and a
half speech than any other piece

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.590
of prose ever penned by an
American;

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.715
you can just start ticking off
the book titles that come out of

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:56.875
phrases.
The latest is Jim McPherson's

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.901
latest book of essays called
This Mighty Scourge of

00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:02.164
War.
At some point we will run out,

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:04.289
it's only a page and a half
after all.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:09.650
"On the occasion corresponding
to this four years ago"--this is

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.090
Lincoln, March,
1865, remembering March

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.289
1861--"all thoughts were
anxiously directed to an

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.960
impending civil war.
All dreaded it,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.721
all sought to avert it.
While the Inaugural Address was

00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:33.871
being delivered from this place
devoted altogether to saving the

00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:38.516
Union without war,"
--yeah--"insurgent agents were

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:43.629
in the city seeking to destroy
it, without war,

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.403
seeking to dissolve the Union
and divide effects by

00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:55.100
negotiation.
Both parties deprecated war,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:03.406
but one of them would make war,
rather than let the nation

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:07.789
survive,
and the other would accept war,

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.440
rather than let it perish.
And the war came."

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.680
Well, now that's Lincoln's
argument, isn't it?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.262
One side would make war,
the other side would accept

00:04:29.262 --> 00:04:32.890
war.
We're going to revisit that

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.917
moment in just a minute,
Lincoln's so-called April

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:43.956
Policy of April 1861,
his maneuvers against Jefferson

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:50.763
Davis's maneuvers about the
single fort in Charleston Harbor

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:55.839
where the Civil War would
actually begin.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.960
Did Lincoln maneuver the South
into the first shot?

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.779
Always been a question
unanswered.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:15.081
Quickly, let me revisit with
you----this question of

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:18.949
causation.
I left that in a bit of

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.672
abeyance.
There was a school of

00:05:21.672 --> 00:05:25.940
interpretation of this war that
it had a tiny,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.829
an interesting little revival
of late,

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:33.326
in the hands of great
historians, people I greatly

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:37.465
admire like Edward Ayers--and
you've read two of his essays

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:41.952
for this week,
"Worrying About the Civil

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:49.639
War--and my colleague here,
Skip Stout, in a different way.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.303
There's been a kind of a little
revival of this notion that the

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:58.516
Civil War might have been
preventable, that it might have

00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:01.697
been needless.
No one is arguing that as

00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:05.499
vigorously as James G.
Randall and Avery Craven and a

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.155
host of other American
historians did in the 1920s,

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:12.079
'30s and '40s,
up to World War Two.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:14.773
World War Two is going to
really reshape that

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:17.160
interpretation and put it on the
run.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.460
But I wanted to just visit it a
moment because it shows us not

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.139
only the historical
interpretations,

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.809
as will be yours,
are influenced by one's own

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.483
times, one's own experiences,
one's own assumptions,

00:06:30.483 --> 00:06:34.639
one's own sentiments,
and how the world shapes us;

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.930
sometimes it comes out of
conviction.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.037
The needless war school of
interpretation was led by James

00:06:41.037 --> 00:06:44.544
Randall and Avery Craven.
In Avery Craven's case he was a

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:47.341
Quaker.
But these were men deeply

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:51.974
influenced by the utter
disillusionment of World War

00:06:51.974 --> 00:06:55.266
One.
They came of age and cut their

00:06:55.266 --> 00:07:00.492
teeth on history at a time when
the world had collapsed into

00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:06.160
what seemed to be in the end an
inexplicable meaningless war.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.797
There's that unforgettable
scene at the very beginning of

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:12.850
The Guns of August by
Barbara Tuchman.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.052
No one reads her anymore.
She was at one point the most

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:19.742
popular historian in America.
She wrote about the Middle

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:22.893
Ages, she wrote about world
wars, she wrote about all kinds

00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:26.865
of things.
Anyway, at the very opening of

00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:33.179
The Guns of August is a
scene where a German general

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:37.338
meets a French general,
somewhere in the mid- or

00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:40.160
late-1920s, and the one general
says to the other,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:48.618
"Sir, why did it happen?"
And the other general says,

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:53.959
"I don't know,
I really don't know."

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.654
In the wake of the Bay of Pigs,
and before the Cuban Missile

00:07:57.654 --> 00:08:01.348
Crisis, President John Kennedy
gave a copy of The Guns of

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:05.042
August and ordered every
member of his National Security

00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:07.610
Council and his cabinet to read
it.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:13.971
And he quoted that passage,
and he said "never will we,

00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:21.039
never shall we be caught having
to answer that question about

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:25.529
war."
I don't know.

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:32.411
In that kind of disillusionment
an interpretation that finds

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:39.409
sheer politics and fanaticism
and aggressive emotionalism,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.094
an overblown kind of--what did
Randall call it--unctuous fury

00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:48.700
as the essential explanation of
why the war came in 1861,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.586
can make a certain sense.
There's a beguiling quality to

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:57.844
that argument,
when we look at the folly of

00:08:57.844 --> 00:09:01.490
human history and the folly of
human nature.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.156
That all changed in so many
ways in the wake of the Second

00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:08.179
World War, a war that was all
about ideology,

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:13.148
all about racism,
all about the survival of

00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:20.009
Enlightenment ideas against
fascism and so on and so on;

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:21.794
and a generation led by such
historians as Arthur Schlesinger

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.874
Jr., and many,
many, many others,

00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:27.708
came to see the American Civil
War's coming,

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:32.968
when they started writing in
the 1950s and '60s and into the

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.875
'70s,
as what they would call an

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:40.200
"irrepressible conflict."
And this array of arguments,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.996
they all get kind of lumped
under this heading,

00:09:43.996 --> 00:09:48.699
irrepressible conflict thesis,
began to flow from American

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:52.288
historians.
Don Fehrenbacher may have

00:09:52.288 --> 00:09:57.549
captured that interpretation
best in a line when he said,

00:09:57.549 --> 00:10:04.468
"The Civil War came and it was
fought to bring"--how did he put

00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:10.494
it--"to bring great national
progress at great national

00:10:10.494 --> 00:10:12.879
cost."
I've never been entirely

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.841
comfortable with that idea,
you know, "well it all had to

00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.120
happen,
it was bloody horrible and

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.228
terrible, and all those people
died, but we all got better for

00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:23.676
it."
That never, never,

00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:26.823
never sits very well with me,
especially when you study the

00:10:26.823 --> 00:10:28.940
memory of the war and the
aftermath.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.383
But what happened in post-World
War Two scholarship--and it's

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:37.826
still there, it's still at the
heart of how we try to explain

00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:42.629
this most pivotal event,
one of the most pivotal events

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:47.177
of American history--is a
certain respect for moral

00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:51.884
questions,
a certain respect for ideas,

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:59.309
and the notion that politics is
sometimes about something.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:05.128
Now that's an utterly horribly
streamlined way of saying--you

00:11:05.128 --> 00:11:09.977
don't find many historians
anymore who argue from a

00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:15.122
needless war perspective,
although what you do find is a

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:19.321
kind of rollercoaster ride
through American scholarship

00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:24.705
about the Civil War,
sometimes deeply influenced by

00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:31.416
Vietnam and sometimes deeply
influenced, even today--some

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:36.090
have argued about Skip Stout's
book;

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.207
if you know Professor Stout.
He has a remarkable new book

00:11:40.207 --> 00:11:45.110
out about whether the American
Civil War was a just war.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.617
And I will re-visit that
question at the end,

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:52.683
near the end of this course,
and use a couple of his

00:11:52.683 --> 00:11:54.970
arguments.
It's a controversial book,

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.894
it's an interesting book.
It's a question we've never

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:03.610
truly asked about this good war.
Was it just?

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.365
Does it fit?
Does it fulfill the principles

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:11.240
of just war doctrine?
Can it?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:23.317
Does it matter?
All right, but back to April,

00:12:23.317 --> 00:12:28.166
1861.
Whether it was just,

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:35.826
and just why it became so
bloody and so prolonged,

00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:42.080
we're going to take up over and
over.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.092
But it surely did happen,
and it began--I don't know if

00:12:47.092 --> 00:12:51.919
that map works terribly well,
it probably doesn't;

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:54.789
it's the best I can do this
morning.

00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:59.568
It is a map of Charleston
Harbor, which had the last

00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:06.088
remaining federal installation,
fort, around the coast of the

00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:12.944
American South still in federal
hands by March and April of

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:16.091
1861.
The seven states of the seceded

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.500
South, the Deep South,
had begun to seize coastal

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.980
forts, they'd begun to seize
federal arsenals.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.940
They seized post offices and
they seized federal courts.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.595
Now I guarantee you today if
you seized a federal court

00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:38.413
office building,
and particularly if you killed

00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:43.649
anybody in the act,
or if you took over a U.S.

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:49.961
Post Office--I know nobody
cares about post offices because

00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:55.816
you do everything online.
Those people down there on Elm

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:59.220
Street, they're such sweet
people;

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.757
the idea of somebody taking
over that post office at

00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:06.830
gunpoint is not a thought.
But if you did that today you'd

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.954
be in federal prison in no time
and you could be charged with

00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:13.776
treason.
Now, we can come back to that

00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:17.481
issue of treason when the course
ends and revisit it,

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.690
if you want,
about this war.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.716
But by and large every federal
installation in a seceded state,

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:28.186
the seven seceded states,
had been seized by those

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:33.620
states, Confederate states,
except Fort Sumter.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.059
And Fort Sumter was a brand new
fort;

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:43.081
oh God, it can't be more than
200, maybe 300 yards across in

00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:46.469
diameter.
It had just been built in the

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:49.840
late 1850s as part of the
coastal fort system.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.139
Big, huge, high stone walls,
about 20 feet high.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:00.656
It sits out at the mouth of
Charleston Harbor,

00:15:00.656 --> 00:15:04.553
here.
It is nearly a mile from Fort

00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:10.519
Sumter to the tip of the town of
Charleston, which is here;

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:13.802
from the Battery Park in
Charleston to the fort is nearly

00:15:13.802 --> 00:15:18.100
a mile.
You can almost not see it.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:25.909
There is today a monument--I
wish I had a slide of it to show

00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:27.839
you.
It's one of my favorite,

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.850
for strange reasons,
Civil War monuments;

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.470
thousands upon thousands of
Civil War monuments.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.670
Many of them are so generic you
don't even notice them.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.532
This one you notice.
It's right at the tip of

00:15:38.532 --> 00:15:42.538
Battery Park in Charleston,
where they used to hang

00:15:42.538 --> 00:15:44.742
pirates.
It looks right out at Fort

00:15:44.742 --> 00:15:47.380
Sumter.
It was put up in the early

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.651
twentieth century.
It's a Confederate monument of

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:56.582
a winged Roman soldier--I think
Roman because the helmet,

00:15:56.582 --> 00:16:01.402
I'm told, is Roman.
He's some combination of a

00:16:01.402 --> 00:16:07.093
winged creature and a soldier.
He's about four times the size

00:16:07.093 --> 00:16:10.127
of life.
He is looking out at Fort

00:16:10.127 --> 00:16:15.029
Sumter, and the inscription
around the bottom says,

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:19.617
"To the defenders of
Charleston," quote,

00:16:19.617 --> 00:16:26.440
"Count them happy who for their
faith and courage endured a

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.424
great fight."
I'm going to repeat that:

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:38.349
"Count them happy who for their
faith and courage endured a

00:16:38.349 --> 00:16:43.133
great fight."
On our monuments of this war,

00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:47.791
almost all of them,
you will find almost nothing

00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:53.737
about what caused the war or
even about what its consequences

00:16:53.737 --> 00:17:01.670
were--almost all of them.
It was just a great fight,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:08.680
and the dead are happy.
Well, what to do about Fort

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.291
Sumter?
In his First Inaugural of March

00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:16.581
4,1861, Lincoln promised,
he said--promised to,

00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:20.404
quote, "hold,
occupy and possess remaining

00:17:20.404 --> 00:17:24.049
federal property."
Now think about it.

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:27.025
If Lincoln and the Republicans
are going to make a stand

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:30.216
against secession--and once he
finally comes into office--by

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.354
the way the day he entered
office all that federal property

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:35.680
had been taken by those seven
states,

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.880
it's already done;
he inherits this situation.

00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:44.900
Now he could've backed away and
continued to try to

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.021
negotiate--and there was a
compromise negotiation under

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:50.217
John J.
Crittenden, a Kentucky Senator,

00:17:50.217 --> 00:17:52.587
in Washington,
for awhile going on in late

00:17:52.587 --> 00:17:55.884
February.
It never came up with anything

00:17:55.884 --> 00:17:57.983
new.
They were going to try again a

00:17:57.983 --> 00:18:00.839
geographic boundary out in the
West with slavery;

00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:04.930
although don't forget the Dred
Scott decision had declared that

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.503
illegal.
They were going to try to rev

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:11.066
up something again about
fugitive slaves to satisfy the

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:13.324
South.
They just couldn't come up with

00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:16.854
any new ideas.
And Lincoln could've tried to

00:18:16.854 --> 00:18:21.833
continue the whole compromise
negotiation conventions,

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:25.748
he could have.
Or he could've held firm to the

00:18:25.748 --> 00:18:29.412
Republican position that
secession was illegal and

00:18:29.412 --> 00:18:33.750
impossible and unconstitutional,
and had to be stopped.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:40.526
But if he lets Fort Sumter
go--there was a garrison there

00:18:40.526 --> 00:18:47.059
led by a colonel named
Anderson--he just lets it go,

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:50.694
in effect he's saying,
"well, maybe all that seizure

00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:53.259
of federal property is
legitimate,

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:57.369
maybe secession is possible,"
right?

00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:01.963
It was about the only place he
could've taken a stand,

00:19:01.963 --> 00:19:04.910
if he was going to take a
stand.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.671
Well, Lincoln was buying time,
and he took a whole month of

00:19:09.671 --> 00:19:13.896
time before he acted.
He was hoping for what he

00:19:13.896 --> 00:19:17.074
called privately,
quote, "voluntary

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:21.166
reconstruction."
He was hoping for saner minds

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:25.880
in the South to--a Union spirit
in the South to somehow take

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.072
hold.
And there's much been said over

00:19:28.072 --> 00:19:30.778
the years about Lincoln
over-estimating Union sentiment

00:19:30.778 --> 00:19:32.950
across the South.
He may have indeed

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.539
over-estimated Union sentiment.
But there was a good deal of it.

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:39.250
There were a lot of frightened
people.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.368
In the upstate counties of
Virginia and Western Virginia

00:19:42.368 --> 00:19:45.429
and in western North Carolina
and eastern Tennessee and

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:48.482
northern Georgia,
those unionist pockets of the

00:19:48.482 --> 00:19:51.950
South were scared about this,
because they have to make

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.102
terrible decisions now.
If this goes to war,

00:19:56.102 --> 00:19:59.710
who do they go with?
Can't stay home.

00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:10.660
Well, Major Robert Anderson had
about eighty men.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:17.153
He was from Kentucky.
There's some slaveholding in

00:20:17.153 --> 00:20:23.369
his background but he'll never
end up with the South.

00:20:23.369 --> 00:20:27.951
Commissioners from South
Carolina had come to Washington

00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:32.950
as early as January of 1861 to
negotiate that specific fort's

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.509
release;
they wanted it.

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:38.559
The federal government had
basically stonewalled it.

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.476
President Buchanan,
the lame duck president,

00:20:41.476 --> 00:20:44.190
tried actually to re-enforce
the fort;

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.274
and by re-enforce the fort I
mean send food to the garrison

00:20:48.274 --> 00:20:51.158
of troops.
Between January 5 and 9,

00:20:51.158 --> 00:20:56.085
of 1861, Buchanan--the only act
Buchanan even tried to make

00:20:56.085 --> 00:21:00.439
about secession,
he was just begging to get out

00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:06.009
of office--Buchanan sent a ship
called the Star of the West,

00:21:06.009 --> 00:21:08.809
full of supplies down the coast
of Fort Sumter to feed the men.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:13.070
Shore batteries around the
harbor actually opened up fire,

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.780
and one had a direct hit on the
ship, but nothing came of it.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.256
Note, it's January 5 to 9.
South Carolina was the only

00:21:22.256 --> 00:21:25.995
seceded state.
It wasn't until the 11^(th)

00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:31.253
that Mississippi went and then
Georgia and then about six

00:21:31.253 --> 00:21:36.844
others, in the next three weeks.
Lincoln's April Policy,

00:21:36.844 --> 00:21:41.053
if you like,
was a process of trying to buy

00:21:41.053 --> 00:21:47.467
time, and if there was to be war
or firing or shooting about Fort

00:21:47.467 --> 00:21:51.463
Sumter,
he was trying to make sure the

00:21:51.463 --> 00:21:56.139
shots were fired by the South.
Now, there were hawks in his

00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:58.568
administration,
there were hawks in the

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:01.700
Republican Party who wanted him
to act faster.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.361
One of them wrote to Lincoln
privately and said,

00:22:05.361 --> 00:22:09.023
quote, "Give up Sumter,
sir, and you are as dead

00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:12.529
politically as John Brown is
physically."

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:18.064
Newspapers across the North,
strongly Republican newspapers,

00:22:18.064 --> 00:22:22.285
started to print headlines
like: "Do We Have a

00:22:22.285 --> 00:22:27.160
Government?;"
"Wanted, a Policy;"

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.080
or, "Come to the Point Mr.
Lincoln."

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.690
And so on.
People were ready now--do

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.191
something!
Now his Secretary of State,

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.869
duly appointed in great part,
as Doris Kearns Goodwin has

00:22:41.869 --> 00:22:44.259
shown and argued in a recent
best-selling book,

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:46.466
Team of Rivals,
was William H.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:50.022
Seward, Lincoln's principle
rival for the nomination of the

00:22:50.022 --> 00:22:54.004
Republican Party.
Lincoln not only put a few of

00:22:54.004 --> 00:22:59.394
his enemies in his own cabinet
to control them and use them

00:22:59.394 --> 00:23:04.783
politically--in the end made an
absolute best friend out of

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:10.250
William Seward--but not yet.
Seward was a dove on this.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:16.053
Seward wanted to negotiate.
He urged evacuation of the fort

00:23:16.053 --> 00:23:20.959
and then he said leave the door
open to voluntary reconstruction

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:24.230
as it might take hold around the
South,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.715
as southerners might see that
this new Lincoln administration

00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:33.565
was willing to talk.
And that isn't all that Seward

00:23:33.565 --> 00:23:36.342
did.
Seward launched a crazy plan to

00:23:36.342 --> 00:23:40.682
declare war on Spain and France
to direct America's attention

00:23:40.682 --> 00:23:44.950
outward to the world and
therefore cause national unity.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.075
[Laughter]
Wag the Dog--did you see

00:23:48.075 --> 00:23:51.522
the movie?
Let's just go to war with Spain

00:23:51.522 --> 00:23:56.017
and France and all those crazy
southerners will realize,

00:23:56.017 --> 00:24:00.061
"oh, the nation is at risk!"
Lincoln immediately rejected

00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:02.705
this idea, although
unfortunately it got out there

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.458
and the foreign ministers of
Spain and France needed

00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:08.049
explanations,
thank you very much.

00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:10.545
[Laughter]
Seward also made private

00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:15.095
promises as Secretary of State
to southerners that Sumter would

00:24:15.095 --> 00:24:20.420
ultimately be evacuated;
just hang in there, just wait.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:28.109
When Lincoln found that out he
said to Seward--in effect--shut

00:24:28.109 --> 00:24:30.800
up.
Now, Lincoln tried in his

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.910
approach to Sumter to separate
reinforcement of these troops,

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.087
a military act,
from provisions,

00:24:39.087 --> 00:24:43.802
a humanitarian act,
and he wanted to stress the

00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:46.805
latter.
He notified finally southern

00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:51.160
officials--he never referred to
them as Confederate governments,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.198
he just notified South
Carolina, he said--that he was

00:24:55.198 --> 00:24:59.470
going to send food and
provisions to hungry soldiers.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.099
Now who could be against that?
He's going to feed some people.

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:06.592
He called it "a mission of
humanity, bringing food to

00:25:06.592 --> 00:25:10.606
hungry men," quote/unquote.
But the Confederate leadership

00:25:10.606 --> 00:25:15.980
took this as a direct challenge.
And Lincoln did indeed send a

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:22.288
ship down the coast about the
8^(th) or 9^(th)--no 6^(th) or

00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:27.696
7^(th) of April,
1861, and the prolonged

00:25:27.696 --> 00:25:34.714
suspense finally came to an end.
That one ship was provisioned

00:25:34.714 --> 00:25:37.017
with food.
Now, the truth is there were

00:25:37.017 --> 00:25:39.549
some arms and some weapons in
the hold as well.

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:43.460
In the end it isn't going to
matter a lot.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.046
The Confederate Cabinet met
under Jefferson Davis on the

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:53.133
9^(th) of April and they made a
decision that if Lincoln tried

00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:57.302
to sail that ship into
Charleston Harbor they would

00:25:57.302 --> 00:26:00.722
fire on it.
On the 11^(th) of April Major

00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:04.383
Anderson, in the fort,
was given a chance to surrender

00:26:04.383 --> 00:26:06.869
by the authorities in
Charleston.

00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:14.109
He refused, and at 4:30 in the
morning, in the dark of night,

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:17.892
April 12,1861,
about 100 cannon from all

00:26:17.892 --> 00:26:22.190
around Charleston Harbor--100
federal cannons originally,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:30.313
now seized by the Confederate
States of America--opened up and

00:26:30.313 --> 00:26:36.440
bombarded Fort Sumter for
thirty-five hours.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.970
Anderson's men hid underground,
in dugouts.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.119
They'd been well prepared for
this.

00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:48.435
And none of them died in the
bombardment of thousands of

00:26:48.435 --> 00:26:55.080
shells lobbed into the fort.
The relief expedition arrived

00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.378
out at the mouth of the harbor
during the firing,

00:27:00.378 --> 00:27:06.273
and it never got to the fort.
On the 14^(th) of April,

00:27:06.273 --> 00:27:11.198
after the bombardment ended,
Anderson was forced to

00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:16.025
surrender the fort,
to take down the United States

00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:19.468
flag.
A brand new Confederate States

00:27:19.468 --> 00:27:22.500
flag with stars and bars was put
up.

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:30.743
And then Anderson's men held a
gun salute, 21-gun salute,

00:27:30.743 --> 00:27:35.392
and the first casualties of the
war occurred when two of

00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:40.210
Anderson's troops were killed on
a powder keg that blew up

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.690
because it was too close to one
of the muskets.

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:59.724
Four Aprils later--620,000 dead
and 1.2 million wounded--the

00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:08.779
flag will go back up at Fort
Sumter on April 14,1862.

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:16.000
It'll be attended by William
Lloyd Garrison and 3000 freed

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.430
people.
But that's a long way away.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:24.824
The day after the firing on
Fort Sumter all across the

00:28:24.824 --> 00:28:29.992
country the headline was "War."
And Lincoln sent an Executive

00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:34.269
Order, not declaring
war--Lincoln's position on this

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:38.882
was clear, to him anyway,
that no nation can declare war

00:28:38.882 --> 00:28:42.304
on itself.
He'd never accepted secession

00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:45.440
as legally constitutional or
appropriate.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.984
But he called for 75,000
volunteers to,

00:28:47.984 --> 00:28:50.930
quote, "put down a domestic
insurrection."

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.942
And in the Constitution,
the President of the United

00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:57.545
States is given control over the
military to put down domestic

00:28:57.545 --> 00:29:02.099
insurrection.
He called it a rebellion.

00:29:02.099 --> 00:29:08.360
Now, the most important
immediate result of the firing

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.794
on Fort Sumter,
of course, was the secession of

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:19.110
the Upper South,
part of the Upper South.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.790
Where's my map?

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.410
Oh I apologize,
I should've had that map right.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.248
Well, you remember the map.
Four more southern states,

00:29:38.248 --> 00:29:40.287
slave states,
will secede in the wake of

00:29:40.287 --> 00:29:41.680
Sumter.
The most pivotal,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.206
of course, was Virginia.
But note, Virginia had held a

00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:49.622
secession convention back in
February and decisively voted

00:29:49.622 --> 00:29:52.743
against secession.
After Fort Sumter,

00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:56.726
in this state of war hysteria
and fever and fear,

00:29:56.726 --> 00:30:01.041
and under now this new argument
that what the Lincoln

00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:06.020
Administration had really done
was an act of coercion against

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.999
the South--coercion--now the
feeding of some 80 soldiers in a

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:15.480
fort was being interpreted as
coercion--okay.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.910
But Virginia quickly,
overnight, held a new secession

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:24.767
convention--actually the State
Legislature held it--and it

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:28.858
voted eighty-eight to
fifty-five--note the vote--

00:30:28.858 --> 00:30:32.949
eighty-eight to fifty-five;
lots of those "no" votes,

00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:36.070
almost all of those "no" votes
coming from the western part of

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.141
Virginia--West Virginia didn't
exist yet--the western part of

00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:41.700
Virginia where there was very
little slavery,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.700
and some of the upper counties
of Virginia.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.674
April 17^(th),
only three days after the

00:30:50.674 --> 00:30:54.487
surrender of Fort Sumter,
Virginia seceded from the

00:30:54.487 --> 00:30:58.008
Union.
By May 6^(th) Arkansas seceded

00:30:58.008 --> 00:31:03.250
by a vote of sixty-nine to one,
in secession convention.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.079
North Carolina,
on May 20^(th),

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:07.885
voted to--and look where North
Carolina is now,

00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:10.630
it's between Virginia and South
Carolina;

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.342
what are they going to do?
They voted unanimously in

00:31:15.342 --> 00:31:19.922
convention to secede.
And finally on June 8^(th),

00:31:19.922 --> 00:31:23.492
by a two to one vote of a
popular referendum--these were

00:31:23.492 --> 00:31:27.062
done in different ways in
different states--in a popular

00:31:27.062 --> 00:31:31.172
referendum Tennessee,
in a two to one vote,

00:31:31.172 --> 00:31:35.670
approximately,
seceded from the Union.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.579
The Confederacy was now eleven
states.

00:31:39.579 --> 00:31:43.680
It would never really be any
more than that.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.340
But there was great tension
about what Maryland,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.390
Delaware, Kentucky and Missouri
would actually do.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:56.312
Lincoln is reported to have
said that he hoped to have God

00:31:56.312 --> 00:32:00.890
on his side, but he was certain
he wanted Kentucky.

00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:07.767
Now, there's been a whole
flurry of emails recently on the

00:32:07.767 --> 00:32:11.525
Slavery and History Network of
historians online trying to

00:32:11.525 --> 00:32:14.438
trace that quote,
just in the past couple of

00:32:14.438 --> 00:32:16.954
weeks.
And the truth is nobody can

00:32:16.954 --> 00:32:19.698
actually find it anywhere.
It's one of those many,

00:32:19.698 --> 00:32:21.029
many, many, probably apocryphal
Lincoln quotes.

00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:24.592
He probably said something like
it, somewhere,

00:32:24.592 --> 00:32:27.600
but I just couldn't resist
using it;

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.256
I've used it for so many years.
So footnote,

00:32:32.256 --> 00:32:38.509
might be apocryphal--okay?
He did need Kentucky,

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:41.941
whatever he said.
All of those states were deeply

00:32:41.941 --> 00:32:45.009
divided about what to do,
and what they will do,

00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:48.492
and the war will prove that,
and they will be terrible,

00:32:48.492 --> 00:32:51.801
horrible places to be,
geographically,

00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:56.030
emotionally,
physically in the war.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:00.150
Maryland was horribly divided.
Note where it is,

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.710
it's right above Washington,
D.C.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.894
Approximately 50,000 white men
fought for the Union,

00:33:07.894 --> 00:33:10.519
in Maryland,
in the Civil War.

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:15.284
Approximately--I'm sorry,
about 50,000 white men in

00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:18.619
Maryland fought in the Civil
War;

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:24.029
30,000 on the Union side,
20,000 on the Confederate side;

00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:29.882
and of those 30,000 on the
Union side, 9000 of them were

00:33:29.882 --> 00:33:34.359
African-Americans.
Kentucky had about 50,000 men

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:38.654
fight for the Union and about
35,000 men fight for the

00:33:38.654 --> 00:33:41.690
Confederacy,
and per capita Kentucky

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.596
produced more African-American
soldiers for the Union Army than

00:33:46.596 --> 00:33:51.940
any other state,
24,000 total.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:57.009
Missouri, the numbers are even
greater.

00:33:57.009 --> 00:33:59.907
In Missouri,
about 80,000 men fought for the

00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:03.210
Union, about 30,000 fought for
the Confederacy,

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.433
and there were about 3,000 that
weren't on either side,

00:34:07.433 --> 00:34:12.283
they were guerillas looking for
the best payday--early versions

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.889
of Jesse James,
without ideology.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.910
Later Jesse James got real
ideology though;

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:22.915
that's another story.
And folks, especially in those

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:26.298
states, this was
immediately--you've heard all

00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:31.035
the clichés about how it
was a fratricidal conflict and a

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:35.170
brothers' war--immediately it
was a brothers' war,

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.827
and thousands of families,
in April and May and June of

00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:44.829
1861, brothers and fathers
looked each other in the eye and

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:48.019
had to decide what they would
do.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:53.517
Henry Clay had seven grandsons
in Kentucky--three fought for

00:34:53.517 --> 00:34:57.989
the Union and four fought for
the Confederacy.

00:34:57.989 --> 00:35:00.936
John J.
Crittenden of Kentucky--he's

00:35:00.936 --> 00:35:05.230
the senator of the Crittenden
Compromise efforts,

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:10.012
in the secession winter--had
one son who became a general in

00:35:10.012 --> 00:35:14.307
the Union Army and one son who
became a general in the

00:35:14.307 --> 00:35:16.885
Confederate Army.
Both survived,

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:20.199
and I've always wanted to know
about Crittenden family

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:23.769
reunions;
but I've never looked into it.

00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:27.058
Mrs.
Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln,

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:31.832
who was of course born and
raised in Kentucky,

00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:37.880
had four brothers who all
fought for the Confederacy,

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.780
and three brothers-in-law who
fought for the Confederacy.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.489
It will lead later to all kinds
of charges of--well some charges

00:35:47.489 --> 00:35:52.274
about treason against her and so
on, sympathies for the South and

00:35:52.274 --> 00:35:54.307
so on and so on.
John C.

00:35:54.307 --> 00:35:58.836
Pemberton from Pennsylvania
became a Confederate general and

00:35:58.836 --> 00:36:03.442
was ultimately the general who
surrendered Vicksburg to Grant

00:36:03.442 --> 00:36:06.650
in 1863.
George Thomas was Virginia

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:11.324
born, old slaveholding family,
but he never resigned his

00:36:11.324 --> 00:36:16.510
commission and he became known
as the Rock of Chickamauga;

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.969
the Union general who won the
Battle of Chickamauga was a

00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:24.016
Virginian.
And these stories go on and on

00:36:24.016 --> 00:36:26.775
and on.
There's the story of Clifton

00:36:26.775 --> 00:36:31.234
and William Prentice.
One of them fought in the

00:36:31.234 --> 00:36:35.590
6^(th) Maryland Infantry,
a Union regiment.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.253
The other fought in the 2^(nd)
Maryland Infantry,

00:36:38.253 --> 00:36:42.152
a Confederate regiment.
Both were wounded at Petersburg

00:36:42.152 --> 00:36:46.772
on April 2, on the same day,
1865, in the last week of the

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:49.205
war,
and they died in cots right

00:36:49.205 --> 00:36:51.970
next to each other in a field
hospital.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:03.814
And the list goes on and on.
Now, when people went to war in

00:37:03.814 --> 00:37:08.369
1861, what did they say they
were doing?

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:10.620
What did they say were their
aims?

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:16.100
What were their reasons?
We have thousands of diary

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.524
entries and letters and
editorials and all sorts of

00:37:21.524 --> 00:37:25.897
things to draw upon.
But on the northern side what

00:37:25.897 --> 00:37:29.911
you find that summer is not only
this sense that this will be a

00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:33.860
short war--and that's a preface
worth pointing out--but people

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.809
would say over and over they
were fighting for the flag,

00:37:37.809 --> 00:37:40.607
they were fighting for the
Union, they were fighting for

00:37:40.607 --> 00:37:42.998
the Constitution,
they were fighting to save the

00:37:42.998 --> 00:37:45.508
Republic,
they were fighting to,

00:37:45.508 --> 00:37:49.672
quote, "save the government."
And you keep hearing those

00:37:49.672 --> 00:37:52.704
phrases and you keep thinking,
"oh man, these are

00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:55.610
abstractions,
what were they really doing?"

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.361
You keep reading and you keep
hearing them say the same damn

00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:02.076
thing.
Well, there's a lot of good

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:06.815
scholarship on this now that
shows us that in 1860s America

00:38:06.815 --> 00:38:09.839
the U.S.
Constitution was important to

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:12.586
people.
They saw it as a kind of

00:38:12.586 --> 00:38:15.485
protection;
they saw it as a source of

00:38:15.485 --> 00:38:19.272
social order.
They saw the American nation as

00:38:19.272 --> 00:38:23.369
now something they were directly
experiencing;

00:38:23.369 --> 00:38:26.924
millions were directly
experiencing the government as

00:38:26.924 --> 00:38:30.000
never before in those debates of
the 1850s.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.724
And as I've said before now,
voter turnout just zoomed in

00:38:33.724 --> 00:38:36.716
the 1850s, to seventy-five and
eighty percent,

00:38:36.716 --> 00:38:39.510
in each general election from
1852 on.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.902
Phillip Paludan,
in a marvelous book about this,

00:38:45.902 --> 00:38:48.449
has said that the Constitution
and the government,

00:38:48.449 --> 00:38:51.660
for so many northerners,
was like a shield of

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.820
protection, and that southern
secession now was not just a

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.423
threat to this government,
it was a threat to social order

00:38:59.423 --> 00:39:01.430
itself, and it therefore had to
be stopped.

00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:09.500
A New Hampshire farmer who
became a buck private in 1861

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.921
said, quote, "The question now
is country or no country,

00:39:13.921 --> 00:39:17.031
liberty or slavery?"
There's a beautiful clarity to

00:39:17.031 --> 00:39:20.932
that isn't there?
Now I don't know what he said,

00:39:20.932 --> 00:39:26.784
after Bull Run or after
Antietam, or after Spotsylvania,

00:39:26.784 --> 00:39:30.537
if he survived.
A fifty year-old railroad

00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:34.066
contractor named Robert
McAllister threw down his

00:39:34.066 --> 00:39:36.860
lucrative job in 1861 and
enlisted,

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.030
at age fifty,
quote, "to help us put down

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.360
this wicked and unjustifiable
rebellion.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.494
Our country and property is
worth nothing if we don't,

00:39:48.494 --> 00:39:53.235
nor will life be secure."
This is all over people's

00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:56.765
letters.
They said they were fighting

00:39:56.765 --> 00:40:02.079
for liberty;
of course, so did southerners.

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:05.755
Now, another argument here,
and again Phil Paludan has made

00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:10.062
this better than anyone I think,
is he's argued that southerners

00:40:10.062 --> 00:40:13.465
and northerners have sort of
come to view the U.S.

00:40:13.465 --> 00:40:16.312
Constitution,
this document we live under,

00:40:16.312 --> 00:40:19.801
in different ways;
that northerners had come to

00:40:19.801 --> 00:40:22.707
see the Constitution as a kind
of protector,

00:40:22.707 --> 00:40:25.679
much violated now by
Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:40:25.679 --> 00:40:29.401
Dred Scott decision,
et cetera, whereas southerners

00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:32.527
had come to see that
constitution more as a

00:40:32.527 --> 00:40:36.128
destroyer,
as something to fear,

00:40:36.128 --> 00:40:41.732
that might, if the wrong people
get hold of it,

00:40:41.732 --> 00:40:46.849
begin to attack or erode their
society.

00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:49.534
There were a lot of people,
particularly in the North but

00:40:49.534 --> 00:40:51.260
then quickly in the South as
well,

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.861
who when this war broke out
began to see it in terms of

00:40:54.861 --> 00:40:57.929
cosmic dualism,
good and evil--God was entering

00:40:57.929 --> 00:41:00.803
history.
Right away, Christian America

00:41:00.803 --> 00:41:04.019
began to interpret this in
millennial terms.

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:09.010
God had a quarrel with America,
people started arguing;

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.499
and they're going to really be
arguing this after the enormous

00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:15.931
bloodshed of '62 and '63 when
they have to try to explain why

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:20.383
this is happening.
They're going to say God has an

00:41:20.383 --> 00:41:26.460
appointment with America and
he's going to decide whose sins

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.568
are worse.
Now, on the southern side,

00:41:29.568 --> 00:41:32.559
as I said, people have to make
tough choices,

00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:35.250
horrible choices.
Who do they go with?

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:42.010
They join their neighbors or
oppose their neighbors?

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.045
Mary Chesnut,
the great diarist from South

00:41:45.045 --> 00:41:49.412
Carolina who indeed kept the
most famous diary by a southern

00:41:49.412 --> 00:41:53.912
woman--there are many of them.
She remembered March and April

00:41:53.912 --> 00:41:57.613
1861 this way--and here we have
another kind of beautiful

00:41:57.613 --> 00:42:01.658
clarity.
"We separated," said Mary

00:42:01.658 --> 00:42:08.030
Chesnut, "because of
incompatibility of temper.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.283
We are divorced,
North from South,

00:42:11.283 --> 00:42:15.030
because we hate each other so
much."

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:23.619
Okay Mary, I get it--divorce
papers--you hate us.

00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:26.176
Walter Nugent,
a Mississippi lawyer,

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:29.975
who did not own slaves,
nevertheless declared in 1861

00:42:29.975 --> 00:42:33.993
that without slave labor--now
the slaveholder is arguing

00:42:33.993 --> 00:42:38.230
this--that without slave labor
the country would be,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:43.184
quote, in his words,
"a barren waste and desolate

00:42:43.184 --> 00:42:45.863
plane.
We can only live and exist by

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:49.634
this species of labor and hence
I am willing to continue the

00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:53.600
fight to the last."
Well, Nugent hadn't seen any

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.070
fight yet, but never mind.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:05.618
Well, in the end the South,
from the highest ranks of

00:43:05.618 --> 00:43:10.050
Jefferson Davis on down to buck
privates,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.280
are all going to say they were
fighting for their liberty;

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.050
everybody was fighting for
their liberty.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:19.511
And when blacks get into this
thing in '62 and '63,

00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:22.349
they're fighting for their
liberty too.

00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:27.141
"Everybody," as Lincoln later
said, "everybody declared for

00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:28.050
liberty."

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:39.493
Now make no mistake,
I love to quote my friend Uriah

00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:44.010
over there on the stone wall in
Woolsey,

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.558
and I walk--every time--every
morning on the way over here to

00:43:45.558 --> 00:43:46.900
class I go by and I rub my
finger on his name for,

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.360
I don't know,
good luck or something;

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.800
if I teach here long enough
it's probably going to wear off.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.969
But everybody in the Union Army
wasn't a Uriah Parmelee;

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:00.428
in fact, the vast majority were
not going to free the slaves

00:44:00.428 --> 00:44:03.744
just yet.
There's a story of a Yankee

00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:09.173
soldier in Virginia in 1861 who
encounters a slave woman and

00:44:09.173 --> 00:44:14.050
he's taken that woman's goods
and that woman says,

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.175
"Well wait a minute,
aren't you coming here to help

00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:21.620
us?"
And he answered her and said--.

00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:29.244
No, the woman says,
"We were told you were coming

00:44:29.244 --> 00:44:33.710
here to help us and instead you
steal from us."

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:37.530
And the soldier replied,
"You're a god-damn liar.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.489
I'm fighting for $14.00 a month
and the Union."

00:44:41.489 --> 00:44:44.309
Well there's a beautiful
clarity in that too--I ain't

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:45.340
here to free you.

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.969
Oh, I got behind on this
outline, didn't I?

00:44:50.969 --> 00:44:54.190
That's okay,
that's actually just fine.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.976
When we resume--don't leave
yet--when we resume next Tuesday

00:45:04.976 --> 00:45:09.076
I will talk a little bit about
West Point and what happened at

00:45:09.076 --> 00:45:11.900
West Point when Union and
Confederate,

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.510
or southern and northern men
begin to leave.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.147
And then we'll begin the war.
We'll talk about comparative

00:45:18.147 --> 00:45:21.538
strengths and so on.
But let me leave you for today

00:45:21.538 --> 00:45:24.382
and the weekend,
if you don't mind,

00:45:24.382 --> 00:45:29.579
with Walt Whitman again.
Whitman's opening poem of his

00:45:29.579 --> 00:45:33.938
immortal collection called
Drum Taps,

00:45:33.938 --> 00:45:39.919
in a kind of agonizing way may
have captured what was in the

00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:46.508
heads of most Americans in 1861.
"To the drum-taps prompt," he

00:45:46.508 --> 00:45:51.010
writes, "the young men falling
in and arming;

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.032
the mechanics arming,
(the trowel,

00:45:53.032 --> 00:45:55.423
the jack-plane,
the blacksmith's hammer,

00:45:55.423 --> 00:45:57.630
tost aside with
precipitation;).

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.743
The blood of the city is
up--arm'd, arm'd!,

00:46:01.743 --> 00:46:05.902
the cry everywhere;
The flags flung out from the

00:46:05.902 --> 00:46:09.207
steeples of churches,
and from all the public

00:46:09.207 --> 00:46:13.117
buildings and stores;
The tearful parting--the mother

00:46:13.117 --> 00:46:16.039
kisses her son--the son kisses
the mother;

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:18.467
(Loth is the mother to
part--yet not a word does she

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:23.680
speak to detain him;).
War, an armed race is advancing;

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.480
the welcome for battle.
No turning away now.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.311
War, be it weeks,
months or years,

00:46:31.311 --> 00:46:37.000
an armed race is advancing and
it welcomes it."

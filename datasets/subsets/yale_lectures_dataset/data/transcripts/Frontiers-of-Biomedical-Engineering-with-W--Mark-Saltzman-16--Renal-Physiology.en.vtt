00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.911
Professor Mark Saltzman:
This week we're going to

00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.314
talk about renal physiology.
Renal is kidney physiology,

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:23.980
the study of the function of
kidneys.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.650
We're going to talk mainly
about how they work when they're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.130
working correctly and what
functions they perform in the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.028
body.
You probably know that they're

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:38.530
important, but hopefully by the
end of the lecture today,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.065
you'll know exactly why they
are so important for your

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:46.172
overall state of health.
You won't live very long

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:49.830
without near normal kidney
function.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.449
The reading on this is Chapter
9 and in section we'll talk

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.473
about a biomedical engineering
innovation that over the last 50

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:04.335
or 60 years or so has really
changed the quality and duration

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.549
of life for patients that have
kidney disease,

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.840
and that's kidney dialysis or
renal dialysis.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.579
We'll talk about that on
Thursday afternoon.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.878
This is just an outline of
the things that we're going to

00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:23.459
cover during the lecture today,
and on Thursday.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.433
We're going to talk about sort
of just gross aspects of the

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.105
urinary system,
the kidney, the bladder,

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:33.120
and the tubes that connect
these things.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.739
I'll talk a little bit about
the differences between plasma;

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:39.730
plasma is the fluid that
circulates in your body.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.348
We thought about circulation of
fluids in the body the week

00:01:44.348 --> 00:01:47.832
before spring break.
We talked about the heart and

00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:51.177
the blood vessels and the blood,
and so the main fluid of

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:55.675
interest there was plasma,
this fluid that blood cells

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:59.027
circulate in.
The main fluid we'll be

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:01.939
interested in renal physiology
is urine.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.900
This is a fluid that's produced
by the kidneys,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.310
stored in the bladder,
and then excreted from the body

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.914
and it's one of the primary
mechanisms that your body has

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:15.582
for getting rid of waste and
regulating the composition of

00:02:15.582 --> 00:02:19.470
fluids like plasma.
I'll talk a little bit more

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.284
about that in just a second.
To understand how it works

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:26.757
we'll talk about the anatomy of
the kidney on the gross level

00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:29.754
and on the microscopic level.
It has an amazingly

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:33.550
sophisticated organization which
is critical for its function.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.164
So, if you understand the
anatomy of the kidney,

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:38.500
you understand a lot about how
it works.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.224
Then we'll talk about specific
about how urine is created in

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.653
the kidney process.
It turns out that all of these

00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:49.370
processes are important for
maintaining your health.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.674
As I mentioned we'll talk
lastly about dialysis which is

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:59.328
an extraordinarily effective,
but not quite perfect means for

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:05.159
keeping people that have kidney
failure in good health.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.722
I've shown you a picture
like this, maybe exactly this

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:09.520
picture or a picture like this
before,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.953
but this is sort of a block
diagram or an engineering view

00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:19.474
of the human body.
You can see the outside world

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:25.244
is the things that surround this
red and blue labeled box and the

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:30.094
inside of the body is inside.
We talked--last time we were

00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:33.952
here, we talked about the
circulatory system and so this

00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:37.810
mechanism for circulating fluids
around in the body.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.830
We talked about how that works
and why that's so important.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.331
You'll remember that when
we talked about the nervous

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.190
system which controls a lot of
body functions.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.953
We talked about,
both in the nervous system and

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:56.557
in the cardiovascular system,
how important certain ions were

00:03:56.557 --> 00:03:59.568
for the function of those cells.
In particular,

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:01.870
we talked about sodium and
potassium.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.990
Sodium and potassium,
which are present--in the case

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.110
of sodium at high concentration
outside of cells,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.870
low concentration inside,
potassium the reverse;

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.759
high concentration inside,
low concentration outside.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:18.115
In order for those cells to
function for a nerve cell to

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:22.630
send a signal down an axon or
for a cardiac muscle cell to

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.768
contract,
those concentrations of ions

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:29.910
have to be present and they have
to be the way that I've

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.598
described.
You have to have high

00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:36.177
extracellular sodium,
low intracellular--high

00:04:36.177 --> 00:04:39.920
intracellular,
potassium low extracellular.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.596
If your sodium and potassium
levels are not correct you can't

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:47.639
make an action potential in the
way that we've described before;

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.720
heart doesn't beat,
brains can't send signals.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.849
All of that physiology we
talked about in the nervous

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.199
system and the heart depends on
having ion concentrations in

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.709
your body at the correct level.
How is that maintained?

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:06.600
Well, one way you could
maintain--you could think about

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.016
it, if you have a box like this,
if this is your body,

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.995
you could think about
maintaining it by just knowing

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:15.208
exactly how much sodium and
potassium to eat everyday so

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.720
that you always keep the right
amount,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.339
and you're going to lose some,
you lose some fluids.

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.114
So, if you knew exactly how
much to eat you could regulate

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:27.894
concentration that way.
That would be--that's difficult

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.430
to do and you know we don't do
that.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.800
We eat, in general,
excess sodium and excess

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.271
potassium.
Somehow our body is keeping

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.690
these concentrations at the
right level.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.430
How does it do that?
Well, that's really the main

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.664
function of the kidney.
The main function of the

00:05:47.664 --> 00:05:51.571
kidney is to sense how much
sodium and potassium there is in

00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:55.544
your body and then to extract
the amount that's not needed in

00:05:55.544 --> 00:05:59.319
order to maintain the levels at
the constant concentration

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.892
that's needed.
The main function of the

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:06.984
urinary system,
which is shown as this part of

00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:11.349
the diagram over here,
is to detect what's in the

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.861
plasma, what's in the blood.
Think about it in terms of

00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.896
sodium and potassium
concentrations,

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:20.629
but there are many,
many other elements that are

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.255
also controlled.
It detects what's there and it

00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:28.472
removes what's not needed.
That is, it removes what is in

00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:32.440
excess of what you need to have
the proper concentration.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.990
Now, you could imagine
doing that in two ways.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.189
Let's just think about sodium
concentrations for--if your

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.759
sodium concentration is too high
so it needs to come down,

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.538
then the kidney could either
excrete more sodium or excrete

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:58.349
less water.
You know that the kidney gets

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:03.639
rid of waste by getting rid of
urine, and urine is mostly

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.883
water.
So, you can control

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:10.211
concentration in the body by
either changing how much of the

00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:14.392
molecule you keep or how much
water you retain or how much

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:18.133
water you lose.
All of these things are linked

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:21.051
together in some way.
The kidneys sit here in

00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.091
intimate contact with the
circulatory system,

00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:25.738
we'll talk about that.
In order to perform this

00:07:25.738 --> 00:07:29.026
function of regulating
concentrations of things in the

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:31.569
blood, it needs to see a lot of
blood.

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:35.048
Blood flow to the kidney is
essential and you'll see that

00:07:35.048 --> 00:07:38.588
its anatomy puts it in a good
position to see a lot of the

00:07:38.588 --> 00:07:40.576
blood flow.
Then it does some

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:43.309
transformations,
it does some functions we'll

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:46.850
talk about over the course of
the next couple of days,

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.470
it then produces a fluid called
urine.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.449
You have a reservoir for urine
in your body called the bladder.

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.947
That's basically just a storage
vessel for urine that's produced

00:07:57.947 --> 00:08:00.389
by the kidneys,
and then you excrete that.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.699
What's in the excreted fluid
urine?

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:06.500
Mainly water,
salts, and organic wastes.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.140
Now, what organic wastes
are eliminated by the kidneys?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.506
Well, think about metabolism;
you're breaking down sugars,

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.786
you're breaking down proteins,
you're using those raw

00:08:18.786 --> 00:08:22.129
materials to build other
molecules but there are waste

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:25.788
products of that process of
breaking down and building back

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:29.320
up molecules.
A waste product of sugar

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.806
metabolism is carbon dioxide,
where it is the final form of

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.590
carbon in the body is carbon
dioxide.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.259
You get rid of that not in the
kidney largely,

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:44.639
but mainly in the lung by
breathing out CO_2.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:47.714
The main product of nitrogen
metabolism--and where does

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:50.830
nitrogen come from?
It comes from proteins that we

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.513
eat.
In the Western world,

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:55.758
in developed worlds,
we eat a lot more protein than

00:08:55.758 --> 00:08:58.159
we need for building new
proteins.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:01.236
We have protein rich diets,
and so you have a lot of waste

00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:03.450
products from proteins that
accumulate.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.432
In particular,
the waste product of nitrogen,

00:09:06.432 --> 00:09:08.669
and all amino acids have
nitrogen.

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:14.163
The end product of metabolism
of amino acids or proteins is a

00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:18.592
molecule called urea.
Urea is an example of an

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:24.110
abundant organic waste that's
eliminated by the kidneys.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.665
It's not volatile,
it's not a gas like carbon

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:28.929
dioxide, so you can't breathe it
out.

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:33.022
It has to be eliminated in
water and it's concentrated in

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:36.681
the urine.
If concentrations of urea get

00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:40.710
to high in your plasma,
it becomes toxic.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.704
One of the main functions of
the kidney is to get rid of

00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:48.190
end-products of nitrogen
metabolism like urea,

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:53.099
to keep the levels low enough
that they don't cause any

00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:55.998
toxicity.
That's a couple of--as you

00:09:55.998 --> 00:09:59.100
can see very important functions
for the kidney.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.383
Getting rid of waste product of
natural metabolism that would

00:10:02.383 --> 00:10:05.287
otherwise be toxic to the body,
that's urea,

00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:09.404
and regulating the
concentrations of ions like

00:10:09.404 --> 00:10:13.051
sodium and potassium.
We could add calcium,

00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.985
and phosphate,
and magnesium,

00:10:14.985 --> 00:10:18.095
but regulating the
concentrations primarily of

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:22.309
sodium and potassium so that the
other organs in your body can

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:26.747
function in the right way.
We call that function

00:10:26.747 --> 00:10:32.088
maintaining the internal
environment, maintaining the

00:10:32.088 --> 00:10:36.171
internal milieu,
maintaining the internal fluid

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:40.293
composition at some constant
level so that the other organs

00:10:40.293 --> 00:10:42.070
can function properly.

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:48.149
Let's think about the
anatomy a little bit,

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:51.611
and it's shown on this slide.
The words on the top of the

00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:54.279
slide just tell you what I
already told you.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.909
You know probably that your
kidneys--you have two of them

00:10:57.909 --> 00:11:01.862
and--one of the left and one on
the right and they set sort of

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.519
right below your ribcage in the
back.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:09.077
They're in the back part of
your abdominal cavity,

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:14.472
a space that's called the retro
peritoneal position in your

00:11:14.472 --> 00:11:16.706
body.
If you remember from the

00:11:16.706 --> 00:11:19.207
circulatory system,
the heart is right here,

00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:22.407
the heart is in the center,
slightly to the left side of

00:11:22.407 --> 00:11:24.965
the chest.
Coming out of the heart,

00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:28.196
the cardiac output comes out
through the aorta,

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:31.988
and the aorta is initially
directed upwards and then it

00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:35.570
curves and goes down through the
abdomen here.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.212
If I trace the path of the
aorta, it starts in the thorax

00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:43.227
between the lungs,
moves down here,

00:11:43.227 --> 00:11:48.320
crosses through the diaphragm
and into the abdominal space,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.499
so this is the abdominal aorta.
You can see that the kidneys

00:11:52.499 --> 00:11:56.470
are positioned on either side of
the abdominal aorta.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.220
Now, the flow through the
abdominal aorta is quite high.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.971
This is one of the main vessels
and there are some branch points

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.679
before it gets there so there is
some blood that goes up to the

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:06.470
head and the upper parts of the
body,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:12.323
but the major portion of the
cardiac output flows down your

00:12:12.323 --> 00:12:16.498
abdominal aorta.
There are two main branches off

00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:20.909
the abdominal aorta right here
called the renal arteries.

00:12:20.909 --> 00:12:25.309
The renal arteries feed blood
to the kidneys directly.

00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:28.904
The kidney is in a great
anatomical position to receive a

00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:31.279
lot of the blood flow,
and it does.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:35.877
This might vary minute to
minute depending on your state

00:12:35.877 --> 00:12:40.391
of health and your level of
activity but it receives on

00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:44.070
average about 25% of the cardiac
output.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.710
Cardiac output was--remember
what the cardiac output number

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.757
was?
A good number to keep in your

00:12:51.757 --> 00:12:55.476
head, 5 L/min,
and so it's receiving over 1

00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:59.230
L/min of blood;
each of the kidneys are,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.084
so that's a lot.
If blood goes in,

00:13:02.084 --> 00:13:05.681
blood has to come back out.
It comes back out through two

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:09.217
renal veins, one from each
kidney which carries the blood

00:13:09.217 --> 00:13:12.690
back to the vena cava and then
back up to the heart.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.913
The kidney is in a privileged
position with respect to the

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:19.419
circulatory system so that it
can receive a lot of the flow.

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:24.014
The blood vessels aren't shown
on this diagram because I wanted

00:13:24.014 --> 00:13:28.757
to make it clear in this diagram
what are the--all the components

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:33.129
of the urinary system but you
can see the renal artery.

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:35.570
This is the blow up of the
kidney over here,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.840
a cross-section so you can see
inside.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.291
The kidney is,
not surprisingly,

00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:48.529
kidney-shaped and so it kind of
wraps around this central core.

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:51.684
In the central core here's the
renal artery which is bringing

00:13:51.684 --> 00:13:53.629
blood in, the one labeled '4'
here,

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:57.789
the renal vein which is taking
blood out is labeled number 5.

00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:02.610
Inside, that renal artery
splits into many smaller

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:08.807
arteries which spread this blood
flow throughout the bulk of the

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:12.354
kidney.
The renal vein carries blood

00:14:12.354 --> 00:14:16.929
back out and back to the vena
cava, as I mentioned.

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:22.534
Now, there's one other
vessel which emerges from this

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:27.638
section of the kidney and this
is called the ureter,

00:14:27.638 --> 00:14:33.492
labeled number 6 here.
This the vessel through which

00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:37.182
urine flows.
That urine flows out of the

00:14:37.182 --> 00:14:41.399
kidney and then down,
down--you can see this ureter,

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:45.285
one from each kidney,
flowing down into this sac

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:49.936
called the bladder.
Then, the bladder has another

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:54.718
vessel which connects to the
outside world called the

00:14:54.718 --> 00:14:57.794
urethra.
Urine is produced continuously

00:14:57.794 --> 00:15:00.891
by the kidneys,
urine is continuously flowing,

00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:03.919
although the rate might change
with time.

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:08.273
It's continually flowing into
the bladder, the bladder is an

00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:12.691
expandable reservoir.
It expands, collects urine

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:16.250
until you're ready to release
it.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.774
Then it's released through the
urethra to the external

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:24.210
environment;
so you have a picture of the

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.399
anatomy.
There are a couple of

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:29.867
functions I didn't talk about
and we won't talk about really

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:33.077
in our time on this subject.
The kidney also has a very

00:15:33.077 --> 00:15:36.492
important function in regulating
blood pressure and we won't talk

00:15:36.492 --> 00:15:40.874
about that.
It also secretes some hormones

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:45.600
that aid in red blood cell
production.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.087
There's some other functions
aside from the ones we talked

00:15:48.087 --> 00:15:50.356
about, but I'm going to talk
about the main ones I've

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:51.360
emphasized already.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:59.286
You have a picture for the
anatomy of the kidneys and where

00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:02.106
they sit.
You will remember that for each

00:16:02.106 --> 00:16:05.856
kidney, now, we'll just assume
that they're each identical for

00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:08.070
the rest of our discussion
today.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.522
For each kidney there's blood
coming in, there's blood going

00:16:12.522 --> 00:16:15.240
out, and there's urine coming
out.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.460
One way,
and we've talked about this a

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.059
little bit before,
but if you're an engineer just

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:23.908
trying to analyze this system,
our question was how does the

00:16:23.908 --> 00:16:28.045
kidney do what it does?
One way to try to understand

00:16:28.045 --> 00:16:31.669
what it does is to treat it very
simply.

00:16:31.669 --> 00:16:35.077
Let's just say it's a black
box, I don't really know

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.549
anything about what goes on
inside.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:41.082
What I know about is that there
are flows going in and out:

00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:43.580
there's the renal artery that
flows in,

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.985
there's the renal vein that
flows out, and there's the

00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:51.144
ureter which carries urine away.
Let's just look at what goes in

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:54.646
and what comes out and see what
we could learn about the

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:58.721
function of the organ or what it
must do just by looking at those

00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:01.888
inputs and outputs.
This is a common mode of

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:06.012
engineering analysis.
If we looked more carefully

00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:10.749
at what's flowing into the
kidney there's blood and flows

00:17:10.749 --> 00:17:13.296
through.
I mentioned a lot of blood goes

00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:15.435
through the kidney at an
astonishing rate,

00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:17.730
that each of your two kidneys
receives 1,

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:22.605
700 liters of blood per day
which flows continuously from

00:17:22.605 --> 00:17:25.740
the aorta into the renal
arteries.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.380
Of that, the blood is composed
of blood cells and plasma,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.214
so if we just looked at the
plasma about half of that volume

00:17:33.214 --> 00:17:36.660
slightly more than half of that
volume is plasma.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.933
What's in plasma?
Mainly water,

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:43.618
proteins like albumin and
antibodies, and salts like

00:17:43.618 --> 00:17:48.302
sodium and potassium
bicarbonate, and waste products

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.918
like urea.
If we measured what the

00:17:50.918 --> 00:17:54.096
concentration was the average
concentration of each of those

00:17:54.096 --> 00:17:58.038
things in the renal arteries,
we could calculate how much

00:17:58.038 --> 00:18:02.400
flows in everyday.
Plasma, 950 liters per day,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.728
that's almost 1,000 liters of
water per day flows through your

00:18:08.728 --> 00:18:17.660
kidneys;
133 mmoles of sodium per day.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.440
Less potassium per day because
there's less

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.221
potassium--concentration of
sodium is high,

00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:26.400
potassium is low in the
extracellular fluid;

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.028
a lot of bicarbonate,
the main pH buffer in the

00:18:30.028 --> 00:18:34.130
blood, and quite a lot of urea,
500 grams of urea.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.724
Remember this is a waste
product so your body needs to

00:18:37.724 --> 00:18:40.844
get rid of this,
so that's what's flowing in to

00:18:40.844 --> 00:18:43.781
each kidney.
What comes out we could

00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:48.240
think about analyzing by looking
at what comes out in the urine.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.592
If we collected the urine and
measured the concentrations,

00:18:53.592 --> 00:18:58.381
what comes out is about 1.5
liters per day of water,

00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.598
of fluid volume.
What comes out in terms of

00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:04.292
sodium?
About 103 mmoles per day,

00:19:04.292 --> 00:19:09.131
so of the 133,000 mmoles of
sodium that go through the

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:14.700
kidneys each day your kidney
gets rid of about 100 mmoles.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.583
So, it's looking at a lot of
sodium, figuring out how much

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:22.739
you need, and then excreting the
little bit of excess that you

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:27.099
have because of excess that
comes in in your diet generally.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.509
We eat more salt than we need
to keep alive.

00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:33.033
With potassium,
50 mmoles per day,

00:19:33.033 --> 00:19:37.240
so it's still a small fraction
of what comes through,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.523
bicarbonate,
small fraction of what comes

00:19:39.523 --> 00:19:41.750
through, and urea--now there's a
lot,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:48.618
52 compared to 475,
so a sizeable fraction of the

00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:55.588
urea gets eliminated every day.
Now, these numbers that are

00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:59.361
percentages over here,
what I did was I just took the

00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:03.422
total amount that you eliminate,
the total amount that's

00:20:03.422 --> 00:20:06.932
eliminated, so 1.5 liters per
day and figured out what

00:20:06.932 --> 00:20:10.772
percentage that was of the total
water that the kidney sees

00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:16.016
everyday;
so 1.5 liters per day is .16%

00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:23.185
of 950 liters per day.
Your kidney excretes .1%--.16%

00:20:23.185 --> 00:20:30.799
of the water that flows through
it, a pretty small fraction,

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:35.039
a similar small fraction of
sodium, more of potassium,

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:40.718
much less of bicarbonate,
and 11% of the urea that goes

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:45.440
through.
How could the kidney do this?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.420
How did the kidney do this?
You probably know something,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.176
how does the kidney work?
How does it separate the

00:20:52.176 --> 00:20:56.620
molecules that it wants to
excrete from all of the

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.519
molecules that are passing
through here?

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:05.258
What must this look like inside
in order to accomplish this

00:21:05.258 --> 00:21:07.808
task?
You can learn a lot about it

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:10.210
just by looking at these
numbers.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.410
How does it work?

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:21.103
Student:
Osmosis?Professor Mark

00:21:21.103 --> 00:21:22.720
Saltzman: Osmosis or--what's
osmosis?

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:30.295
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:33.279
Saltzman: It's--osmosis is
separation across a membrane,

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:37.250
where you have a semi-permeable
membrane and that's a good idea.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.125
There is osmosis that goes on
and we're going to talk about

00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.529
it.
Osmosis is a really critical

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:48.185
way that the kidney functions at
the microscopic level and we'll

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:51.847
talk about that.
There's another sort of more

00:21:51.847 --> 00:21:55.718
cruder level of function that
I'm thinking about,

00:21:55.718 --> 00:22:00.124
or a simpler level of function.
How do--what was your vision of

00:22:00.124 --> 00:22:02.540
how the kidney worked when you
came in here?

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.832
What does your kidney do?
Student:

00:22:06.832 --> 00:22:08.050
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Filters?

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.330
It's a filter.
How do filters work?

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.810
How does a filter work?

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.796
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:22:23.796 --> 00:22:26.164
Saltzman: A filter works
because it has some property

00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:27.940
that if you put a liquid on top
of it,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.607
some of the components of the
liquid will pass through and

00:22:30.607 --> 00:22:33.576
some of them won't.
Generally when you think about

00:22:33.576 --> 00:22:37.549
filters what physical principle
does it use to keep things on

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:40.530
one side or to decide what
passes through?

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:46.595
What property of molecules?
Size, generally filters work

00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:49.590
based on size,
they're mechanical and they

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.900
have holes in them and those
holes are of a certain size and

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.064
so only molecules that are
smaller than that size can pass

00:22:58.064 --> 00:23:00.900
through.
Now, that would make sense

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.612
for the kidney because what's in
the blood that you don't want to

00:23:04.612 --> 00:23:07.143
pass through?
You don't want blood cells to

00:23:07.143 --> 00:23:10.350
pass through and those are
large, those are 5 or 10 microns

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.790
in diameter.
You don't want those to pass

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.185
through so let's have a filter
that keeps blood cells on one

00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:19.809
side and only allows things that
are smaller than blood cells to

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:22.592
go through.
You also have proteins in your

00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:25.509
blood and those are generally
large molecules.

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:28.614
You have albumin,
you have antibodies,

00:23:28.614 --> 00:23:32.809
you have lots of lipoproteins,
you have insulin,

00:23:32.809 --> 00:23:36.042
you have lots of proteins that
are in the blood and those have

00:23:36.042 --> 00:23:38.109
important functions inside your
body.

00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:41.334
They're hard to make,
you don't want to lose them,

00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:43.835
and in general,
the filter is such that

00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:47.691
proteins don't go through.
Small molecules can go

00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:51.671
through, glucose can go through,
and it's a much smaller

00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:54.106
molecule.
Do you want glucose to go

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:57.405
through?
In fact, I haven't even listed

00:23:57.405 --> 00:24:01.690
it here, would you want glucose
to go through?

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.938
Probably not because you worked
hard to gather your food and eat

00:24:05.938 --> 00:24:09.579
it, and you want to extract the
energy from glucose,

00:24:09.579 --> 00:24:12.866
you don't want to lose a lot of
it so you'd like to keep that

00:24:12.866 --> 00:24:15.470
in.
It's a small molecule;

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.250
in fact, it's not so much
bigger than urea or sodium,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.099
or potassium,
or bicarbonate.

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:25.700
These are all fairly small
molecules.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.130
They all pass very easily
through the filter.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:37.186
If your kidney was just a
filter what would you expect to

00:24:37.186 --> 00:24:40.776
see in the urine?
In particular,

00:24:40.776 --> 00:24:44.690
what would these percentages be
if the kidney acts as a filter?

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:49.378
If I tell you that all of these
molecules are smaller--are small

00:24:49.378 --> 00:24:53.100
enough to pass freely through
the kidney filter?

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.953
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:25:00.953 --> 00:25:04.262
Saltzman: Higher
or--Student:

00:25:04.262 --> 00:25:09.185
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Well they'd all be

00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:11.029
the same,
right?

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:12.859
They'd all be the same
percentage.

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:16.145
If the kidney was just a filter
and everything passed through

00:25:16.145 --> 00:25:18.390
that was smaller than a certain
amount,

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.303
then what you should see in the
urine is just the same--exact

00:25:23.303 --> 00:25:27.480
same percentage in the urine as
is in the plasma.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.773
If your kidney was just a
filter and it just allowed urea,

00:25:31.773 --> 00:25:34.259
and bicarbonate,
and potassium,

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:37.565
and sodium, and water to pass
through then you should have the

00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:41.250
same fraction of water,
etc.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.740
These percentages wouldn't be
different;

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.730
they'd be whatever they needed
to be.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.369
Now, what's the most
important thing here?

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:49.374
Getting rid of the toxic
compound, got to get rid of the

00:25:49.374 --> 00:25:51.559
toxic compound otherwise you get
sick.

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:57.433
If the kidney was just a filter
and I needed to get rid of 11%

00:25:57.433 --> 00:26:03.500
of the urea, then I would have
to also lose 11% of the water.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.323
In a simple filter,
if I want to get rid of 11% of

00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:10.990
the urea, and the urea is
dissolved in water,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.345
they both pass through the
filter then I'd have to get rid

00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:18.965
of 11% of the water.
Let's say 11% is about 100

00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:26.895
times this, 100 x .16% so that
would mean this number has to be

00:26:26.895 --> 00:26:32.492
100 liters per day.
What's the problem with

00:26:32.492 --> 00:26:37.130
having a urine output of 100
liters per day?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.898
That's a lot.
Could you sit through a class

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:46.960
that's 50 minutes long?
Probably not;

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.049
is there a 1 liter bottle?
How big is--that's probably

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:51.640
bigger than a liter right?

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:04.656
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:05.079
Saltzman: Just about a
liter;

00:27:05.079 --> 00:27:11.213
so you would pee 100 of those
per day, so your bladder is--can

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:16.843
be a pretty good size but it's
not big enough to hold 100

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:21.849
liters,
your body is not that big.

00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:26.463
A problem, if your kidney was a
simple filter,

00:27:26.463 --> 00:27:30.666
is that you would have to be
losing water,

00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:36.216
excreting water all the time.
The flip side of that is for

00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:40.703
you not to shrink you've got to
be consuming that amount of

00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:43.327
water.
If the kidney was a simple

00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:48.072
filter and you needed to get rid
of urea, and assuming that these

00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:52.669
numbers are appropriate numbers
for--then you would have to pee

00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:57.266
out over 100 liters per day and
you have to drink 100 liters of

00:27:57.266 --> 00:28:01.269
water per day in order to
maintain your volume.

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:03.380
What happens if you lose
too much volume?

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.646
Then your ion concentrations go
out of whack as well because

00:28:07.646 --> 00:28:11.480
they're not dissolved in the
right volume of water.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.420
Your kidney must have some
other mechanism besides being a

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.400
filter.
In particular,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.829
it has to recover things that
you need.

00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:27.869
Filtration is an important part
of it, but it also has to be

00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:33.294
selective in some way,
and filtration is not selective

00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:35.853
enough.
Filtration is not selective

00:28:35.853 --> 00:28:39.039
enough because there are lots of
molecules that are about the

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:41.104
same size,
some that are toxic,

00:28:41.104 --> 00:28:45.295
and some that are essential for
health, and you can't separate

00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:48.694
them just based on size.
Just another example of

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:52.183
that if we looked--another way
to look at how the kidney works

00:28:52.183 --> 00:28:55.272
is to look at relative
concentrations in the plasma and

00:28:55.272 --> 00:28:59.321
the urine.
Ordinarily, the kidney is very,

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:04.160
very good at keeping glucose
out of the urine.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.200
Even though it's a small
molecule, it gets filtered along

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.674
with urea, the kidney saves it
somehow so that it's abnormal to

00:29:12.674 --> 00:29:16.499
have any urine in your--any
glucose in your urine even

00:29:16.499 --> 00:29:20.539
though you have high
concentrations in the plasma.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:24.526
You get rid of quite a lot of
sodium, a tremendous amount of

00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:27.967
urea as we mentioned,
and creatine is another waste

00:29:27.967 --> 00:29:31.742
product that turns out to be
important for reasons we won't

00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:36.140
really talk about very much.
How does it work if it's

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.705
not just a simple filter?
Well, filtration is an

00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:42.663
important part of it,
so filtration occurs in the

00:29:42.663 --> 00:29:45.249
kidney,
it's the initial separation

00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:49.481
that happens where molecules
that your kidney is processing

00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:52.400
gets separated from the blood
plasma.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.954
Filtration is the important
first step and I'll talk about

00:29:54.954 --> 00:29:57.950
that in a few moments.
This filtration does not

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.272
directly produce urine.
You know what the problem with

00:30:01.272 --> 00:30:03.937
that is, it's you'd have to
produce too much urine if that

00:30:03.937 --> 00:30:05.619
was the only thing that
happened.

00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:12.163
Instead, the kidney reabsorbs,
so after the filtration step it

00:30:12.163 --> 00:30:18.600
takes the fluid that's produced
by filtration and it looks at

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:24.930
that fluid and it decides what
things the body can use,

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.217
water, glucose,
sodium, potassium,

00:30:28.217 --> 00:30:32.599
and it reabsorbs them back into
the blood.

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:36.227
Filtration is the first
function, re-absorption is the

00:30:36.227 --> 00:30:39.391
second function.
If you're filtering 100 liters

00:30:39.391 --> 00:30:43.511
per day and you're only creating
1 liter of urine that means that

00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:46.279
there's a lot of re-absorption
going on.

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:50.470
Most of the water that gets
filtered through the kidney gets

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.519
reabsorbed, only that small
fraction, .1% gets excreted in

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.693
urine.
We're going to call the

00:30:57.693 --> 00:31:03.583
filtrate, or the fluid that gets
produced by filtration,

00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:07.759
that's fluid that wants to be
urine.

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:11.944
It wants to be urine someday
but it's--that's what it aspires

00:31:11.944 --> 00:31:16.059
too, it aspires to be urine but
it's not quite urine yet.

00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:20.229
The important role of the
kidney is to make that--is to

00:31:20.229 --> 00:31:25.016
extract back out the fluids that
are in this sort of want-to-be

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:29.803
urine the things that it can use
to produce a very concentrated

00:31:29.803 --> 00:31:32.685
waste stream.
The kidney also directly

00:31:32.685 --> 00:31:35.868
secretes some compounds,
so there's some compounds that

00:31:35.868 --> 00:31:39.406
aren't filtered very effectively
or as effectively as we need

00:31:39.406 --> 00:31:42.264
them to be.
The kidney has mechanisms for

00:31:42.264 --> 00:31:46.291
taking molecules directly from
the blood and pumping them into

00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:48.785
the urine.
That's a little--that's a

00:31:48.785 --> 00:31:52.711
specialized function that's a
little bit beyond where we need

00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:54.502
to go.
I wanted to show it to you

00:31:54.502 --> 00:31:57.232
for--where we have time to go I
wanted to show it to you for

00:31:57.232 --> 00:31:59.693
completion.
If you go on to study

00:31:59.693 --> 00:32:03.319
physiology you'll learn a lot
about this.

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:05.288
There's filtration,
re-absorption,

00:32:05.288 --> 00:32:08.689
this accounts for the majority
of what happens in terms of

00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:11.830
processing to form urine,
but there's also secretion,

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.808
and then finally the urine that
goes to the bladder and is

00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:15.540
eliminated.

00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:23.358
Just coming back to this
picture again,

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.879
the renal arteries,
about 180 liters of that fluid

00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:29.609
that comes in per day is
filtered.

00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:34.499
This is about 900 and some
liters of plasma that goes into

00:32:34.499 --> 00:32:37.293
the kidneys.
Of that, 180 liters are

00:32:37.293 --> 00:32:41.658
filtered, meaning that whatever
the filter portion of the kidney

00:32:41.658 --> 00:32:45.188
is 180 of those liters,
or a fairly substantial

00:32:45.188 --> 00:32:47.970
fraction, passes through the
filter.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:55.862
You only lose about 1.5 liters
per day of urine and that means

00:32:55.862 --> 00:33:02.849
that the kidney is reabsorbing
178.5 liters per day.

00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:07.234
That's an astounding amount of
work, both to filter this

00:33:07.234 --> 00:33:11.460
quantity of fluid and then
recover that fluid back,

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.036
takes a lot of energy and we'll
see that there's a lot of action

00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:20.540
that's going on inside the cells
of the kidney to allow this to

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.357
happen.
You should be very grateful

00:33:23.357 --> 00:33:27.328
because if your kidney did not
do this work for you then there

00:33:27.328 --> 00:33:31.493
are a lot of activities that you
would have trouble participating

00:33:31.493 --> 00:33:35.008
in if you had to be constantly
worried about peeing and

00:33:35.008 --> 00:33:37.675
drinking,
you couldn't wait to do it

00:33:37.675 --> 00:33:41.426
because you've got to do it all
the time in order to maintain

00:33:41.426 --> 00:33:43.989
this balance life would be very
different.

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:47.490
This is the problem when the
kidneys begin to fail.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.505
If you're not filtering,
secreting, and reabsorbing this

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:55.667
much water which the kidneys do
through very active energy

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:59.690
consuming processes,
then what happens?

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.078
Concentration of urea goes up,
concentration of sodium and

00:34:04.078 --> 00:34:08.391
potassium gets out of whack,
and your health very quickly

00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:11.636
deteriorates.
You cannot live a healthy life

00:34:11.636 --> 00:34:15.640
very long without all of these
things happening continuously.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.010
How does the kidney
accomplish these functions?

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:27.306
It accomplishes it through a
marvelously elegant machine

00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:31.255
called the nephron,
and the nephron is the

00:34:31.255 --> 00:34:36.083
functional unit of the kidney.
I'm going to show you in a

00:34:36.083 --> 00:34:39.070
diagram in a moment,
this is sort of the picture,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.616
a cartoon of the kidney if you
turned it on its side,

00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:44.260
it's sitting up this way and
its kidney bean shaped.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.459
I turned it on its side,
so this part at the capsule is

00:34:48.459 --> 00:34:52.798
pointing up and it's up here,
and the inner part or the

00:34:52.798 --> 00:34:57.272
medulla, the part where all the
vessels come in is pointing

00:34:57.272 --> 00:35:01.148
down.
Oriented within each kidney are

00:35:01.148 --> 00:35:07.138
a million, over a million of
these functional units called

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.703
nephrons.
Nephrons are just a series of

00:35:10.703 --> 00:35:15.309
tubes that are arranged in a
very specific configuration.

00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:18.785
We'll see in the next slide
that nephrons look slightly

00:35:18.785 --> 00:35:22.133
different, there are
nephrons--of these million there

00:35:22.133 --> 00:35:26.123
are different populations that
look slightly different but they

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:30.652
all have the same basic anatomy.
I'll just trace through the

00:35:30.652 --> 00:35:34.548
anatomy here starting at this
little tuft at the top of the

00:35:34.548 --> 00:35:37.369
nephron or near the top of the
nephron,

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:41.260
so near the capsule is a
structure called the glomerulus.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:47.522
The glomerulus is where the
blood-carrying tubes and the

00:35:47.522 --> 00:35:53.399
urine-carrying tubes meet.
The glomerulus is where these

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:58.343
two sets of tubules meet.
The glomerulus is the structure

00:35:58.343 --> 00:36:03.872
in which filtration takes place.
What you see here is a ball

00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:09.531
which is basically a sac.
You imagine a sac that is

00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:16.449
enclosing sort of a tuft or a
tumbleweed of blood vessels.

00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:20.026
There's blood that's coming
into this tuft of capillaries

00:36:20.026 --> 00:36:22.389
and there's blood that's going
out.

00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:24.848
You can't really see it here
but there's blood that's coming

00:36:24.848 --> 00:36:26.389
in, there's blood that's going
out.

00:36:26.389 --> 00:36:32.550
Each of these tufts is really a
branch of the renal artery.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.093
I showed you the picture,
the renal artery comes in,

00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:36.440
it branches,
it branches,

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.561
it branches,
it branches a million times and

00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:46.216
there--one of those million
branches goes to each glomerulus

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:50.530
and it forms a tuft of
capillaries there.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.343
This capillary is surrounded by
a sac, the capillary comes in,

00:36:55.343 --> 00:37:00.463
and it's surrounded by a sac.
Filtration occurs across

00:37:00.463 --> 00:37:04.590
these capillary walls.
How does filtration occur?

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:10.109
Filtration occurs by a pressure
drop, so the same physical force

00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:14.840
that's moving blood through your
circulatory system.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.244
We talked about blood pressure
generated by your heart,

00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:21.271
and within this tuft of
capillaries this blood is

00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:25.460
pressurized.
It's pressurized because it's

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.902
not that far from your heart.
There's not that much

00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:32.976
resistance between where
pressure is formed in your heart

00:37:32.976 --> 00:37:37.376
and this tuft.
In the sac outside is a low

00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:39.990
pressure.
Now, this is a different kind

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.836
of a pressure drop because we've
been thinking about a pressure

00:37:42.836 --> 00:37:45.195
drop along a tube,
high pressure here,

00:37:45.195 --> 00:37:48.722
low pressure here,
and so fluid flows through the

00:37:48.722 --> 00:37:50.926
tube.
Instead, now we have high

00:37:50.926 --> 00:37:54.548
pressure inside of a tuft of
capillaries and low pressure

00:37:54.548 --> 00:37:57.437
outside,
so the pressure drop is not

00:37:57.437 --> 00:38:01.389
along the tube it's across the
wall of the tube.

00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:06.410
If there's a pressure drop
across the wall of the tube and

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.550
the wall is leaky then water can
move across,

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.889
so it moves from inside the
tube to outside,

00:38:12.889 --> 00:38:18.019
high pressure inside the tube,
low pressure outside.

00:38:18.019 --> 00:38:20.161
This is where the
filtration function of the

00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:22.166
kidney takes place,
in the capillaries of the

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.783
glomerulus.
The capillaries of the

00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:25.691
glomerulus are leaky,
there are holes in them,

00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:27.769
and so if there's high pressure
on the inside,

00:38:27.769 --> 00:38:31.546
low pressure on the outside,
fluid can flow through and

00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:35.951
anything that's small enough to
fit through these holes can pass

00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:40.440
through with the fluid.
That 100 liters per day that's

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.293
filtered occurs in these one
million glomeruli of the one

00:38:45.293 --> 00:38:51.215
million nephron in each kidney.
The space that's in this sac

00:38:51.215 --> 00:38:56.741
here is where the first
differences between urine and

00:38:56.741 --> 00:39:01.273
plasma are created.
The fluid that accumulates in

00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:05.963
this sac outside the glomerulus
by filtration is different from

00:39:05.963 --> 00:39:08.787
plasma.
It's different from plasma in

00:39:08.787 --> 00:39:11.604
what way?
Well, it only has molecules

00:39:11.604 --> 00:39:16.047
that are small enough to pass
through the filter and so it

00:39:16.047 --> 00:39:20.099
only has molecules that are
below a certain size.

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:22.662
Plasma has blood cells,
it has red blood cells,

00:39:22.662 --> 00:39:24.780
has white blood cells,
has proteins,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.450
glucose, ions,
but the urine only has things

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.780
that are smaller than a certain
size.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.561
Imagine a cut off in molecular
weight and everything that's

00:39:36.561 --> 00:39:40.470
below that is present;
everything that's above is not

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.358
present.
How does the concentration

00:39:43.358 --> 00:39:47.821
of sodium in the glomerulus
compare to the concentration of

00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:52.130
sodium in this space--in this
want-to-be urine space?

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.891
Well, the concentration is the
same at this point because what

00:39:55.891 --> 00:39:58.050
you have here is just a
filtrate.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.886
If the molecule is very small
like water, or like sodium,

00:40:01.886 --> 00:40:05.380
then all the molecules are
going to pass through;

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.358
there won't be any difference
in concentration on either side

00:40:09.358 --> 00:40:12.541
of the filter.
What does this fluid look like

00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:16.712
at this point of the tube of the
beginning of the urine flow

00:40:16.712 --> 00:40:20.366
pathway?
It looks like what's called an

00:40:20.366 --> 00:40:24.806
ultra-filtrate of plasma.
It looks like plasma but with

00:40:24.806 --> 00:40:27.960
just the big molecules,
the big stuff removed.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.380
The concentration of everything
else would be the same.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:39.665
Does that make sense?
After filtration,

00:40:39.665 --> 00:40:44.633
this fluid passes through this
winding set of tubes,

00:40:44.633 --> 00:40:49.219
these winding set of tubules;
these are called the kidney

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:51.092
tubules.
This is not blood that's

00:40:51.092 --> 00:40:54.030
flowing through here now,
but this is the fluid that

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.310
wants to be urine.
It flows through--these tubules

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:00.050
in the kidney are divided into
segments.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:04.280
The first segment is called the
proximal convoluted tubule.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.460
It's called convoluted because
it twists around,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.654
it's proximal because proximal
means near, and this part of the

00:41:11.654 --> 00:41:15.398
tube is near the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule,

00:41:15.398 --> 00:41:19.178
the fluid flows through;
it flows down this loop and

00:41:19.178 --> 00:41:24.245
this loop extends from the top
near the cortex of the kidney

00:41:24.245 --> 00:41:28.110
down toward the medulla and then
up again.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:33.170
There's a loop and this loop is
called the Loop of Henle,

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.876
after an anatomist who
described it first,

00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:40.219
so it's called the Loop of
Henle.

00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:44.529
Then there's another region
here which is another twisting,

00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:47.798
winding tubule,
another convoluted tubule but

00:41:47.798 --> 00:41:52.233
it's far from the glomerulus,
so this is called the distal

00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:55.878
convoluted tubule.
Finally that distal convoluted

00:41:55.878 --> 00:42:00.398
tubule flows into a straight
duct that goes down through the

00:42:00.398 --> 00:42:03.309
medulla called the collecting
duct.

00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:10.216
This collecting duct dumps
directly into the ureter which

00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:15.921
carries urine to the bladder.
There's a lot of action

00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:19.149
here.
The--an ultra-filtrate of

00:42:19.149 --> 00:42:26.117
plasma is formed in this space,
this space by the way is called

00:42:26.117 --> 00:42:29.734
Bowman's space,
after another anatomist who

00:42:29.734 --> 00:42:32.687
first discovered it,
the space where the filtration

00:42:32.687 --> 00:42:35.050
occurs into is called Bowman's
space.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.924
The urine flows through the
distal convoluted tubule,

00:42:37.924 --> 00:42:40.079
through the Loop of Henle--I'm
sorry,

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:43.317
through the proximal convoluted
tubule, down the Loop of Henle,

00:42:43.317 --> 00:42:47.147
back up the Loop of Henle,
through the distal prox--distal

00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:51.499
convoluted tubule into the
collecting duct and then out to

00:42:51.499 --> 00:42:55.070
the ureter and the bladder.
Now, what's happening?

00:42:55.070 --> 00:43:00.679
Why this complicated series of
tubes arranged in this way?

00:43:00.679 --> 00:43:05.680
Actually, if we looked at the
microscopic anatomy in each of

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.070
these tubes, that's what's shown
here,

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:12.904
is what do the cells look like
that form these tubes at

00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:15.389
different regions of the
nephron?

00:43:15.389 --> 00:43:17.958
One thing that you could
notice, and that anatomists

00:43:17.958 --> 00:43:20.199
noticed when they started
studying the kidney,

00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:23.357
is that these tubes all
look--these tubes are all

00:43:23.357 --> 00:43:26.579
composed of cells that look
slightly different.

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:29.740
The reason that they look
slightly different is because

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.139
they're performing different
functions.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:35.399
The details of the functions
that they're performing are

00:43:35.399 --> 00:43:38.539
beyond the scope of what we're
going to talk about,

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:41.230
or you'll be responsible for,
I'll mention a few of them.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:46.084
One way to think about is that
different parts of the tubule

00:43:46.084 --> 00:43:50.363
have different functions in
terms of re-absorption of

00:43:50.363 --> 00:43:54.979
molecules from the urine.
The main task of the nephron,

00:43:54.979 --> 00:43:59.284
after this filtration step,
is to recover the things that

00:43:59.284 --> 00:44:02.393
the body still needs,
to recover sodium,

00:44:02.393 --> 00:44:05.199
to recover glucose,
to recover potassium,

00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:09.550
and to recover most importantly
water so that you don't have to

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.409
be drinking constantly in order
to remain healthy.

00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:17.288
Different parts of the tubule
are responsible for different

00:44:17.288 --> 00:44:20.030
elements of that re-absorption
process.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.380
It turns out it's not quite
so simple as that.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.813
You couldn't say glucose is
here, sodium's here,

00:44:25.813 --> 00:44:29.174
potassium's here,
it's not quite that separated

00:44:29.174 --> 00:44:33.119
but they function in sort of a
coordination in order to

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:37.429
accomplish this overall process
with each part of the tubule

00:44:37.429 --> 00:44:41.739
performing slightly different
functions to do that.

00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:44.059
Here's the picture that I
promised earlier,

00:44:44.059 --> 00:44:47.262
where I just wanted to show you
what I've been showing you,

00:44:47.262 --> 00:44:50.754
the kidney turned on its side.
Here you'd be laying down on

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:53.868
your side I guess and the
abdominal aorta's coming down

00:44:53.868 --> 00:44:56.463
here,
blood flowing up to this

00:44:56.463 --> 00:45:00.551
kidney, here's the capsule,
here's the medulla,

00:45:00.551 --> 00:45:05.440
and here's all the nephrons
arranged in this up and down

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.440
pattern along the breadth of the
kidney.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.375
This just shows that there are
glomeruli, these small tufts

00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:19.139
everywhere throughout this upper
region of the kidney,

00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:23.499
that there are--that all of
these glomeruli are branches of

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:27.164
a branch of the renal artery,
and that nephrons,

00:45:27.164 --> 00:45:30.574
you can see in the cartoon I
showed you before,

00:45:30.574 --> 00:45:34.240
here's one nephron shown,
here's the glomerulus,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.349
and here's the proximal
convoluted tubule.

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:40.118
You can see in this more
elaborate drawing just how

00:45:40.118 --> 00:45:42.261
convoluted it is.
There are many,

00:45:42.261 --> 00:45:46.046
many--these are quite long
tubules, so there's a long

00:45:46.046 --> 00:45:48.739
pathway for fluid to flow
through.

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:53.135
That's in order to give the
kidney cells time to perform

00:45:53.135 --> 00:45:57.850
this function on all of the
fluid that's flowing through the

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.872
kidney.
This is kind of a

00:45:59.872 --> 00:46:03.409
complicated picture and I'll let
you look at it at your leisure.

00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:05.659
These are posted on the Classes
Server.

00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:08.699
What I want to show you mainly
is this figure down here.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:13.179
This is a picture of the filter
in the kidney.

00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:15.840
Where does the filter reside in
the kidney?

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.070
It's at the--it's the
capillaries;

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.385
it's the walls of these
capillaries that form these

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:25.726
tufts in the glomerulus.
This picture is a scanning

00:46:25.726 --> 00:46:29.457
electron micrograph that was
taken by--by taking one of these

00:46:29.457 --> 00:46:31.379
capillaries,
cutting it open,

00:46:31.379 --> 00:46:34.719
and then spreading it out so
you could look down on the

00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:37.958
surface.
Here we're like looking from

00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:43.533
the--actually from the outside
of the tube in and what you see

00:46:43.533 --> 00:46:46.316
is holes.
These are physical holes that

00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:49.806
are of a size that allows small
molecules to pass through but

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:53.179
keep blood cells and large
molecules on the other side.

00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:56.874
The kidney really is a filter
in an important sense and it

00:46:56.874 --> 00:47:00.634
functions just like a coffee
filter or any of the synthetic

00:47:00.634 --> 00:47:04.957
filters you might use,
which are just mainly made of

00:47:04.957 --> 00:47:10.324
materials that have many small
holes in them and that's what

00:47:10.324 --> 00:47:14.937
this tubule looks like.
So there is a filtration

00:47:14.937 --> 00:47:17.108
function.
In order to perform this

00:47:17.108 --> 00:47:19.844
filtration function,
I already mentioned that you

00:47:19.844 --> 00:47:23.712
need to have pressure,
you got to have a pressure drop

00:47:23.712 --> 00:47:28.125
in order to filter and that
pressure drop is generated by

00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:30.908
the heart.
Here's an interesting thing,

00:47:30.908 --> 00:47:34.050
we talked about pressure drop
in the circulation.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:40.324
Remember when we talked before
spring break about where is the

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:46.291
main resistance to pressure or
to flow along the vessels of

00:47:46.291 --> 00:47:51.121
your cardiovascular system.
Pressure is generated by the

00:47:51.121 --> 00:47:54.403
heart, if we think about the
left side of the heart blood

00:47:54.403 --> 00:47:57.539
flows into the aorta,
into large arteries,

00:47:57.539 --> 00:48:01.951
arterioles, capillaries,
that's where exchange takes

00:48:01.951 --> 00:48:03.953
place,
back into venules,

00:48:03.953 --> 00:48:07.306
veins, back to the heart.
Where was the main pressure

00:48:07.306 --> 00:48:09.480
drop, the main source of
resistance?

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.492
Which one of those elements had
the largest resistance,

00:48:13.492 --> 00:48:14.830
do you remember?

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.493
Somebody--Brian did
you--Student:

00:48:21.493 --> 00:48:25.308
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Capillaries have a

00:48:25.308 --> 00:48:29.063
sizeable resistance but not the
most and it is important because

00:48:29.063 --> 00:48:32.580
it's the place where--remember
size is regulated so that you

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.679
can adjust flow rates most
sensitively here;

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:39.949
in the arterioles or the small
arteries.

00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:43.555
It turns out that the
glomerular capillaries or the

00:48:43.555 --> 00:48:47.882
capillaries of these tufts sit
in the unique position between

00:48:47.882 --> 00:48:51.946
two sets of arterioles.
Arteriole that leads into the

00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:56.469
glomerulus and an arteriole that
leads out of the glomerulus.

00:48:56.469 --> 00:49:00.192
Because of that if you have
this tuft of capillaries that's

00:49:00.192 --> 00:49:03.464
sitting on either side of an
arteriole--now what did

00:49:03.464 --> 00:49:06.291
arterioles do?
They were of the right size,

00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:09.695
the right physical dimension so
that they created a fairly

00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:12.800
substantial resistance to flow,
that's one thing.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.146
They're the right size to
create a fairly substantial

00:49:16.146 --> 00:49:19.428
resistance to flow and they can
expand and contract,

00:49:19.428 --> 00:49:22.260
and so they can adjust their
resistance.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.469
What happens when they adjust
their resistance?

00:49:24.469 --> 00:49:27.967
They change the overall
pressure drop for that segment,

00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:31.593
and by changing the pressure
drop you can change how much

00:49:31.593 --> 00:49:34.690
flow occurs.
Well, the glomerular

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:39.413
capillaries sit here between two
arterioles and they can

00:49:39.413 --> 00:49:42.590
independently regulate their
size.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:47.477
What that allows the individual
nephron to do is to adjust

00:49:47.477 --> 00:49:52.280
what's the pressure inside its
glomerular capillaries.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.331
If I want the pressure to be
lower, then I squeeze in on this

00:49:56.331 --> 00:50:00.743
one, the one that's leading in,
I get more of a pressure drop

00:50:00.743 --> 00:50:05.110
across that arteriole so the
pressure's lower coming out.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.264
If I want the higher pressure
drop on the glomerular

00:50:08.264 --> 00:50:11.542
capillaries I expand this so
that I don't have as much

00:50:11.542 --> 00:50:13.844
resistance,
I don't have as much of a

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.210
pressure drop,
I have higher pressure in the

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.713
glomerular capillaries.
Now, why would that make a

00:50:19.713 --> 00:50:22.101
difference?
Because remember these

00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:25.418
glomerular capillaries sit
inside this capsule where

00:50:25.418 --> 00:50:28.801
there's a low pressure.
If I have high pressure here,

00:50:28.801 --> 00:50:30.960
low pressure here,
I get filtration.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.874
If pressure goes up inside here
but stays the same out here I

00:50:34.874 --> 00:50:37.848
get more filtration;
if pressure goes down I get

00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:40.915
less.
Every individual nephron has a

00:50:40.915 --> 00:50:46.003
mechanism for regulating how
much fluid it filters at any

00:50:46.003 --> 00:50:50.916
particular time,
and it does that by regulating

00:50:50.916 --> 00:50:56.440
the arteries on either side of
the glomerular tuft.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.175
I'm going to stop there and
then we'll continue next time

00:51:00.175 --> 00:51:03.973
talking a little bit more detail
about how the kidneys do this

00:51:03.973 --> 00:51:06.900
task of recovering molecules
that you need.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:07.540
Questions?

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.566
Good, see you on Thursday.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.595
Prof: Today we're
enjoying the first beautiful day

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:09.420
in quite some time.
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.040
Today we're very pleased to
have William Ryerson as our

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.393
guest speaker and he is
President of the Population

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:20.310
Media Center,
which by the end of the lecture

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.370
period you will know what that
is.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.193
He graduated from Amherst
College and then he became one

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:27.750
of us.
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.866
He was a graduate student at
Yale studying entomology,

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.280
the ecology of insects.
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.697
In that field people seem to
realize that humans are pushing

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.840
even the insects out of
existence,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.314
so he then became interested in
the human aspects of ecological

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:49.140
and population kind of things.
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.657
Thirty-three years ago he
started working in the field of

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.040
reproductive health.
 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.665
Then after, I guess 15 years,
in that he started being

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:03.725
involved with a group that was
making TV programs and radio

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:09.135
dramas in developing countries
and that are on social issues of

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:14.459
things that are troubling the
societies in which they're shown

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:15.420
to.
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.721
Eventually he founded this
group, The Population Media

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:24.510
Center, and is both the founder
and the President of PMC.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.168
These soap operas are different
than the kind of soap operas

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:28.610
that we're used to in America.
 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.140
Their purpose is to explore
this social change and deal with

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.056
the issues that are of great
currency for developing

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:41.279
countries where the cultures are
changing rapidly in one

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:46.742
direction or another,
or not changing rapidly as the

00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:48.180
case may be.
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.800
One of the big foci is women's
reproductive issues,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.660
population issues,
HIV issues, child bride issues,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.623
all the kinds of--a lot of the
ones that we've been talking

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:02.060
about in the class.
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.525
What's nice about him,
and due to his Yale training of

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.788
course,
is that both in the design of

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:11.662
these programs,
he uses really good academic

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:13.716
research,
what's really known about

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.830
social change and the induction
of social change,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.068
they just don't go off and be
artsy-fartsy about anything.

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:24.370
They really study what is the
successful way of doing this.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.657
Not only that,
then there's really three

00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:28.300
stages of professionalism.
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.272
One, understanding the academic
stuff so you know what you're

00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:33.752
doing,
then getting the very best

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.348
people in whatever country
you're working in,

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.800
the real good actors,
the major producers,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.085
and groups that really know
what they're doing in terms of

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.910
entertainment and that leads to
great success,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.729
which he'll describe.
 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.373
Then further,
the third step,

00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:49.430
is once you've done it,
did it work,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.836
and that's the real serious
research, finding out if you've

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.068
done something.
 

00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:56.715
You're hoping to incorporate
some sort of social change,

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:57.628
well did it work?
 

00:02:57.628 --> 00:03:01.811
That's not easy,
but again Bill's group has used

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:07.238
the most careful and stringent
academic research to try to get

00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:08.840
at that issue.
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.763
These programs have turned out
to be very popular successes and

00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:18.527
you will hear about that and
they have indeed been successful

00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:20.990
in fostering social change.
 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.991
I put Bill into the category of
'people who have made a

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:24.770
difference.'
 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.560
This is not a huge category,
and so I'm very proud--to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.639
introduce him to you.
 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.395
William Ryerson:
 Bob, thank you very much,

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:37.389
pleasure to be with you.
 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.680
As Bob said,
I started my career here at

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.318
Yale as a graduate student in
ecology and evolution,

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:49.198
and it was just 40 years ago
last October that I sat in the

00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:53.077
audience at the Forestry School
and heard Paul Ehrlich talk

00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:56.020
about his then recently
published book,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.110
The Population Bomb.
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.177
He had been invited to give
that lecture by Charles

00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:05.188
Remington who founded this
course,

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:09.471
and who was,
along with Paul and an attorney

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:12.060
from Connecticut named--
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.860
whatever his name was,
an attorney from Connecticut,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.100
along with Paul and Charlie
Remington,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.694
founded Zero Population Growth
immediately after the lecture

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:30.019
that Paul gave.
 

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.733
I had dinner with Paul at
Remington's house that night,

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:38.000
got very interested in--Dick
Bowers was the attorney's name.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.990
I knew it would come to me
sooner or later when those

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.199
synapses connected.
 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.247
--I had dinner with Ehrlich at
Remington's house that night,

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:52.380
took a huge interest in this
issue, which of course continues

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.750
to this day.
 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.374
We're growing by the equivalent
of a new Egypt every year on a

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:03.952
global level,
about 82 million net growth and

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:09.160
the environmental impact of that
growth is immense.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.492
I began, at that point,
to think about how to address

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:16.024
population issues,
how to try to bring about a

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:19.019
slowing of population growth
rates,

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.819
and how to also ameliorate the
impact of humans on the planet.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.995
The conventional wisdom at the
time was to set up family

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.790
planning clinics,
which indeed was a good idea.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.733
A lot of that happened,
particularly in the 1970s with

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:41.232
strong financial support and
leadership from the

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.730
U.S. Government,
something that changed over the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.120
last few decades but is coming
back into popularity with the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.279
new administration.
 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.053
Indeed, what became evident,
even in the 1970s,

00:05:56.053 --> 00:06:01.451
was that the solution was not
just the medical model,

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:05.500
setting up family planning
clinics.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.410
Indeed, there was a need to get
people to use them.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.302
There was great progress made,
particularly in the 1970s in

00:06:16.302 --> 00:06:18.920
meeting the already existing
demand,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.439
so we went from 10% of the
world's couples using modern

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.776
methods of contraception in 1960
to somewhere in the 40% in the

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:37.012
late 1970s and then since then
it has crept up to 55% of adult

00:06:37.012 --> 00:06:40.589
couples using modern methods.
 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.399
The 45% non-users,
however, outnumber the 90%

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:52.870
non-users of 1960 because of
population growth.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.699
We have as big a problem ahead
of us as we did in 1960,

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.459
but we also have another
problem, which is the reasons

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.660
that they give for non-use.
 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.935
Back in the early 1960s the
primary reason was lack of

00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:09.680
access to contraceptive methods.
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.689
Now, in country after country,
it's less than 2% who give that

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.303
as their reason,
and the number one reason is

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:22.129
wanting more children;
that is, the bulk of the

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.100
non-users of contraception.
 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.028
When you take them out,
maybe 200 million couples,

00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:37.593
there is another 100 million
that are not using contraception

00:07:37.593 --> 00:07:42.190
but don't want an additional
pregnancy,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.230
at least not in the next two
years,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.497
which is the standard question
that's asked in demographic and

00:07:47.497 --> 00:07:48.410
health surveys.
 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.524
The top four reasons they give
for their non-use are fear of

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:55.964
side effects,
they've heard its dangerous,

00:07:55.964 --> 00:07:59.230
male opposition,
religious opposition,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.410
and fatalism.
 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.490
Now a couple of stories about
these;

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.952
fear of side effects is
something that indeed has been

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:11.482
intentionally planted by some
religious zealots who are

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:14.497
spreading rumors,
particularly around east

00:08:14.497 --> 00:08:17.519
Africa, that condoms contain the
AIDS virus,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:21.009
so people are actually dying
because of this misinformation.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:24.317
They're afraid of using
condoms, they have heard that

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:27.370
they contain the HIV virus,
and so they're having

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.360
unprotected sex and getting AIDS
and dying.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.360
It's really a criminal
misinformation campaign

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.025
motivated by people who just
think artificial methods of

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:40.759
contraception are not a good
idea for theological reasons

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:44.158
that most of their victims don't
understand,

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:48.809
and, for that matter,
that I don't understand but

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:50.070
I've tried.
 

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.660
Male opposition is in
part--male opposition,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.916
and it's in part lack of
communication between husbands

00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:56.759
and wives.
 

00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:59.529
So, sometimes,
in traditional societies,

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:02.210
women think their husbands are
opposed,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.886
but they've never had a
conversation about it in their

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.356
married life because this is
something that they're

00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:11.298
embarrassed to bring up.
 

00:09:11.298 --> 00:09:15.727
Fatalism is the subject of a
very interesting paper by

00:09:15.727 --> 00:09:17.649
Etienne Van Der Walt.
 

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.850
Prof: They've read it.
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.142
William Ryerson:
 Oh, you've read it.

00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:24.341
Okay so you know about fatalism
and beliefs that whatever God

00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:27.647
has decided for you must be fine
without any idea that you have

00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:30.100
the right and the ability to
determine--

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.490
your own outcomes of your
family life.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.972
Then religious opposition,
when I say this in the mass

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:40.785
media I always draw a lot of
fire, but there is no religion

00:09:40.785 --> 00:09:43.350
that is opposed to family
planning.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.658
You may have heard otherwise.
 

00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:48.913
There are religions,
like the Catholic Church and

00:09:48.913 --> 00:09:51.490
some conservative mullahs in
Islam,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.870
who are opposed to certain
methods of family planning,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.398
but there is no religion that
is preaching that everybody

00:09:56.398 --> 00:09:58.340
should have as many children as
possible.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.221
Indeed, the Catholic Church is
in favor of people limiting

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:08.960
their childbearing to those they
can afford to care for and love.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.359
The issue is what methods are
appropriate and certainly we

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:17.990
know from Catholic teachings
that methods that are considered

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.460
artificial are not approved.
 

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.164
But, indeed,
the church goes to great

00:10:22.164 --> 00:10:24.960
lengths to teach what we used to
call the rhythm method,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.942
periodic abstinence as a way of
avoiding unwanted or unplanned

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:32.120
pregnancy.
 

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.219
In the world of Islam there are
liberal thinkers who are Islamic

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.970
scholars,
like Kutbuddin Aziz of

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.908
Pakistan, who have written that
the Koran,

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:46.250
by calling on women to
breastfeed their infants for at

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.879
least two years,
is inherently endorsing family

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.690
planning.
 

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.230
The Koran doesn't mention
family planning,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.684
but by asking that women
breastfeed their infants for two

00:10:56.684 --> 00:10:59.548
years in low nutrition
societies,

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:03.158
this means the woman must avoid
pregnancy.

00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:08.399
So there are in fact official
findings at Al-Iman University

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.908
to that effect.
 

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:14.052
Some Muslim countries are
making huge strides in adopting

00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:17.443
family planning,
the leading one being Iran,

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:21.120
which is now down at
replacement level fertility.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.518
In part, driven by the
Ayatollah's in that country who

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:26.250
are promoting family use.
 

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.535
In Pakistan now,
the mosques are handing out

00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:30.759
contraception.
 

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:35.980
So there's a dramatic change
going on in the world of Islam.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.643
Having been in the population
field for a long time,

00:11:40.643 --> 00:11:46.129
I happened to go to the first
World Population Conference.

00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:49.870
By the way, I got involved with
Ehrlich and Remington and

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.408
starting a Yale Chapter of Zero
Population Growth,

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:57.186
it no longer exists,
and ended up on the National

00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:00.570
Executive Committee of that
organization.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.976
I went to work with The
Population Institute in

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.421
Washington,
an organization which I now

00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:09.289
also am President of,
as of six months ago,

00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:15.028
just to keep me from running
out of things to do.

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:18.754
At this first world conference
on population,

00:12:18.754 --> 00:12:23.073
held in Bucharest in 1974,
I took 65 students and 20

00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:26.038
faculty members from around the
U.S.

00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:30.778
to cover this event for
newspapers across the U.S.

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:33.937
Each of the students was
accredited with a particular

00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:36.610
newspaper and they all went as
reporters,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.460
and they filed daily reports,
and it literally generated

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.960
hundreds of news articles about
this conference.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.970
Margaret Mead happened to be at
this conference,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.538
as did a colleague of mine from
the institute,

00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:53.869
David Poindexter who now is the
Honorary Chair of Population

00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:54.970
Media Center.
 

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.436
The two of them looked at the
proposed plan of action that the

00:12:59.436 --> 00:12:59.729
U.N.
 

00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:04.121
had put together and found that
there was no reference to the

00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:05.658
status of women.
 

00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:09.485
So, they sat down and wrote a
paragraph about the status of

00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:13.245
women and took it to Phil
Claxton, who was the head of the

00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:13.509
U.S.
 

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:17.136
delegation, a staff member of
the State Department Under

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:21.293
Secretary General--I mean Under
Secretary of State Department on

00:13:21.293 --> 00:13:23.139
Population Affairs.
 

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:26.068
They said, 'Phil,
the plan of action says nothing

00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:29.739
about the status of women,
so we've written a paragraph,

00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:33.735
could you please introduce this
in the planning session of the

00:13:33.735 --> 00:13:35.700
intergovernmental meeting?'
 

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.198
He said, 'Well this is a
meeting about family planning,

00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:42.308
what's the status of women got
to do with it?'

00:13:42.308 --> 00:13:45.250
By 1994, the most recent
U.N. Conference,

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.144
which I also attended,
the world had come to recognize

00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:53.408
that the status of women is
central to everything having to

00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:58.259
do not only with population but
with economic development.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:02.798
If you educate daughters,
you educate the families of the

00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:05.797
future, whereas,
if you educate a man,

00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:07.580
you educate a man.
 

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.182
There is a huge need to change
the bias among many people

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:14.592
around the world that their
daughter's place is in the

00:14:14.592 --> 00:14:17.198
kitchen,
or for sale to some man in a

00:14:17.198 --> 00:14:20.880
polygamous marriage,
and their son's place is in

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.558
school.
 

00:14:21.558 --> 00:14:25.360
Indeed, promoting behavior
change in that area,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.683
and the human rights of women
to play an equal role with their

00:14:29.683 --> 00:14:33.866
husbands in making decisions
about family life is critically

00:14:33.866 --> 00:14:34.860
important.
 

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:40.950
Now the first real interest I
took in the population field,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.128
after hearing Ehrlich's talk
about the ecological impact of

00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:50.950
human encroachment on the wild
lands of the planet,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:57.128
and the threat to biodiversity,
was the impact of different age

00:14:57.128 --> 00:15:02.509
structures of human populations
on economic welfare.

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:06.716
There is a Princeton--now
deceased Princeton demographer

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:09.470
and economist named Ainsley
Cole,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.200
who did a lot of work in this
area and I wrote--

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.082
a paper at the Forestry School
about his studies of the

00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:25.620
dependency ratios that grow from
different age structures.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.077
That is to say,
the number of non-working

00:15:29.077 --> 00:15:33.408
children per working adult,
and in very large family

00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:37.172
societies,
i.e., rapid population growth

00:15:37.172 --> 00:15:40.044
countries,
which are mostly low income,

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:43.216
people spend a very high
percentage of their income on

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:46.029
immediate survival needs of
their children,

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.558
food, housing, and clothing.
 

00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:54.182
When they reduce family size,
even without any change in

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:57.870
family income,
there's money left over and

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.986
that money can be spent on
elective goods which stimulates

00:16:01.986 --> 00:16:04.009
the manufacturing sector.
 

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:07.254
It can be invested in
education, it can be invested

00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:09.914
through the government and
infrastructure,

00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:12.899
both of those build economic
productivity.

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:16.885
Most important,
it can be saved and put into

00:16:16.885 --> 00:16:21.985
investments or just savings
accounts that builds capital

00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:26.899
that allows businesses to borrow
money and grow,

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:28.370
building employment.
 

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.538
Indeed, it's the lack of
capital in many poor,

00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:35.467
rapid population growth,
countries that is keeping

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:37.620
business from expanding and
that,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.119
as a result,
is leading to economic

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:43.840
stagnation.
 

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.897
When you look at the history of
the countries that have gone

00:16:48.897 --> 00:16:53.783
from developing status to
developed status since World War

00:16:53.783 --> 00:16:55.321
II,
South Korea,

00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:57.450
Japan, Hong Kong,
Singapore,

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.390
Taiwan, The Bahamas,
and Barbados,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:05.383
each of those countries first
instituted strong voluntary

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:11.000
family planning programs and
then their economies took off.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.582
Because once the fertility rate
got down below about 2.3 money

00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:18.681
was left over,
capital was formed,

00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:22.902
businesses expanded,
and some of the Asian tigers,

00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:25.380
China being the lead among
them,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.429
now are undergoing rapid
economic growth for the same

00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:30.130
reason.
 

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.941
Obviously, economic policies
and various other factors affect

00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:41.848
this but demographics are a key
aspect of economic welfare.

00:17:41.848 --> 00:17:44.324
Infrastructure is also,
as I mentioned,

00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:46.930
a key issue for economic
productivity.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.398
If you don't have roads to get
your crops or products to

00:17:50.398 --> 00:17:53.057
market,
you don't have airports,

00:17:53.057 --> 00:17:58.163
you don't have clean water,
and a lot of other things that

00:17:58.163 --> 00:18:01.348
public infrastructure consists
of,

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:06.457
number one being education,
schools for the upcoming

00:18:06.457 --> 00:18:10.961
generations,
then your economy is going to

00:18:10.961 --> 00:18:11.788
falter.
 

00:18:11.788 --> 00:18:16.779
The average developing country
spends $13,000 for public

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:19.230
infrastructure:
schools,

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.920
roads, municipal offices,
water, sewer,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.558
etc., electricity over the
lifetime of each person,

00:18:27.558 --> 00:18:30.690
so a per capita expenditure of
$13,000.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.821
When you multiply $13,000 times
the net growth of the world's

00:18:34.821 --> 00:18:38.608
population every year of 82
million, what do you get?

00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:41.990
Have you done that in your head
already?

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.519
Its a trillion dollars a year.
 

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:49.667
The price tag just to keep per
capita infrastructure even in

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:54.904
countries around the developing
world is a trillion dollars a

00:18:54.904 --> 00:18:55.690
year.
 

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.616
They are coming nowhere near
making this expenditure,

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:01.201
they can't;
they don't have that kind of

00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:04.308
money, in part because of
economic stagnation.

00:19:04.308 --> 00:19:09.432
That is being aggravated by
rural to urban migration and so

00:19:09.432 --> 00:19:14.201
you see urban centers in
developing countries where the

00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:18.440
urban infrastructure is totally
overwhelmed.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.578
I was in Kinshasa a year and a
half ago,

00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:23.950
in Democratic Republic of the
Congo,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.702
and that's a city that has
infrastructure designed to

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:34.279
handle 600,000 people with ten
million people living there.

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:37.506
In fact, hundreds of thousands
of people are sleeping on open

00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:40.336
ground;
they just have no place to

00:19:40.336 --> 00:19:40.970
sleep.
 

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.009
The city floods every time it
rains.

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:47.140
There's inadequate sewage
protection--or sewage treatment.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.612
And the nuclear power plant
that the Belgians,

00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:53.699
in their wisdom,
put in before they left,

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:57.250
is sitting at the edge of an
erosion zone.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.714
They don't have the money to
stop it so the plant is in

00:20:00.714 --> 00:20:02.318
danger of falling over.
 

00:20:02.318 --> 00:20:08.868
The environmental advisor to
the governor of Kinshasa state,

00:20:08.868 --> 00:20:12.210
who met my plane,
said he's been trying to--

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.282
he and the governor have been
trying to get the President of

00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:18.410
the country to shut the nuclear
power plant down because,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.008
if it falls over,
it's going to make the whole

00:20:21.008 --> 00:20:22.884
area,
including Brazzaville across

00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:25.476
the river,
uninhabitable for thousands of

00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:25.940
years.
 

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.609
But, the President won't shut
it down because he wants to get

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:32.974
enough nuclear by-product to
build a bomb so he can bomb

00:20:32.974 --> 00:20:35.241
Rwanda,
because Rwanda has troops

00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:38.118
operating in eastern Congo,
which I visited.

00:20:38.118 --> 00:20:41.321
I was in Goma about a little
less than a year ago and I

00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:44.108
thought Kinshasa was bad until I
got to Goma.

00:20:44.108 --> 00:20:50.224
Goma is where the fighting has
been going on recently in North

00:20:50.224 --> 00:20:51.828
Kivu Province.
 

00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:56.542
Now when you see these extreme
examples of lack of

00:20:56.542 --> 00:21:02.219
infrastructure you realize this
analysis by Ainsley Cole was

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.240
really prophetic.
 

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.729
Now the environmental impacts
that Paul Ehrlich talked about

00:21:09.729 --> 00:21:14.567
have gone way beyond loss of
wild lands and threat to

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:16.150
biodiversity.
 

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.053
In fact, one of the biggest
environmental threats,

00:21:21.053 --> 00:21:26.757
right now, is pumping out water
from underground aquifers,

00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:30.759
80% of which is used for
irrigation.

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:34.740
In China, in India,
in the American Southwest,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:41.510
in every continent on the
planet, because of our growing

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:46.190
population and the demand for
food,

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.650
which you may have noticed went
up in price recently,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.998
the farmers of the world are
pumping out the underground

00:21:52.998 --> 00:21:56.346
aquifers at rates higher than
the rate of replacement by

00:21:56.346 --> 00:21:57.200
rainwater.
 

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.730
This is a classic example of
something that's not

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.470
sustainable.
 

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.598
It's like taking money out of
the bank to pay for your daily

00:22:04.598 --> 00:22:05.859
living expenses.
 

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.940
You can only do that so long.
 

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.450
The water table in India is
dropping by ten feet a year.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.961
A thousand farmers of India a
couple of weeks ago committed

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.130
mass suicide.
 

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.446
They are having crop failures
as they can no longer drill deep

00:22:22.446 --> 00:22:24.430
enough to reach the water.
 

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.888
India's green revolution,
which bought India maybe 30

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:31.537
years of time,
according to Norman Borlaug who

00:22:31.537 --> 00:22:36.328
won the Nobel Prize for his
research on high-yield wheat and

00:22:36.328 --> 00:22:38.454
rice,
and by the way,

00:22:38.454 --> 00:22:42.828
who is a member of our program
advisory board.

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:48.128
The green revolution crops are
dependent on high volumes of

00:22:48.128 --> 00:22:51.509
water for irrigation and cheap
oil.

00:22:51.509 --> 00:22:56.273
Not only to run the tractors
but to make pesticides and

00:22:56.273 --> 00:22:59.479
fertilizer,
to keep these crops growing,

00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:03.558
and in fact there's an article
in The New York Times

00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:07.568
within the last week about the
coming failure of the green

00:23:07.568 --> 00:23:10.696
revolution crops of India,
but every country,

00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:13.440
or at least every continent,
is facing this problem.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:27.046
The yellow river in China does
not reach the ocean two-thirds

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:32.430
of the year because it's all
being used for irrigation.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.700
What is keeping the rivers of
India and China flowing

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.382
periodically is the melting of
the Himalayan glaciers that

00:23:41.382 --> 00:23:45.160
occurrs seasonally and waters
those lands.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.969
However, with climate change,
we're losing the glaciers and

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:52.280
when they disappear,
which will be in this century

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.884
at the rate things are going and
probably in the next three

00:23:55.884 --> 00:23:59.472
decades,
that combined with inability to

00:23:59.472 --> 00:24:04.976
find any more underground water
will lead to traumatic crises

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:07.818
with regard to food in Asia.
 

00:24:07.818 --> 00:24:11.442
And, for that matter,
the same thing is happening in

00:24:11.442 --> 00:24:15.847
Africa and we're losing farmland
in the American Southwest with

00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:17.980
the same process going on.
 

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.538
This is a crisis in the making
of global proportions combined

00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:28.728
with climate change which is
causing rainfall patterns to

00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:33.048
change,
and in some places rainfall to

00:24:33.048 --> 00:24:34.118
decrease.
 

00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:41.256
Climate change is indeed the
very visible example of why our

00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:45.490
current pattern is
unsustainable.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.684
We are already above 350 ppm in
the atmosphere of carbon

00:24:50.684 --> 00:24:51.630
dioxide.
 

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.259
That means, even if we stop
driving cars and stop heating

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:59.553
with oil tomorrow,
and we burn no more fossil

00:24:59.553 --> 00:25:03.615
fuels of any kind,
we are already going to have

00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:05.420
devastating climate change.
 

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.990
The arguments going on in the
halls of Congress are,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.068
can we reduce the rate of
increase,

00:25:12.068 --> 00:25:17.443
or can we maybe become so
efficient that we level off or

00:25:17.443 --> 00:25:22.818
slightly decrease our rates of
greenhouse gas output?

00:25:22.818 --> 00:25:28.445
This is like arguing over which
deck chairs to sit in on the

00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:29.400
Titanic.
 

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.395
Unless we actually stop
producing greenhouse gases and

00:25:34.395 --> 00:25:39.864
find technology to withdraw
carbon dioxide and methane from

00:25:39.864 --> 00:25:43.414
the atmosphere,
the climate is going over a

00:25:43.414 --> 00:25:44.650
cliff this century.
 

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.618
Now, don't slit your wrists,
there are things we can do.

00:25:49.618 --> 00:25:53.922
We have the technology to solve
a lot of these problems and,

00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:57.858
indeed, the population issue is
a clear cut example.

00:25:57.858 --> 00:26:00.250
Population, by the way,
is a climate issue.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:06.667
How many children you have is a
climate related decision because

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:08.205
if,
as an American,

00:26:08.205 --> 00:26:12.220
Americans have the highest per
capita output of greenhouse gas,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.575
you have two children each of
whom consume 10% less than you

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:22.557
do,
you're still creating an impact

00:26:22.557 --> 00:26:25.420
on the environment.
 

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.769
If you have three children,
you and your partner or spouse

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:32.670
are more than replacing
yourselves,

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.682
and you're having a potentially
devastating impact on the

00:26:36.682 --> 00:26:40.480
environment if a lot people make
the same decision.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.038
Decisions on reducing family
size,

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:45.509
in developed countries in
particular,

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:49.701
are the least expensive
intervention we can make to

00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:52.298
reduce impact on the climate.
 

00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:56.396
Even in the developing world,
where population growth is

00:26:56.396 --> 00:27:00.492
occurring the fastest,
the rather optimistic median

00:27:00.492 --> 00:27:05.198
projection of the United Nations
between now and 2050 is the

00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:07.910
addition of 2.5 billion people.
 

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.549
That's eight times the U.S.
 

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:10.278
population.
 

00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:15.267
At the rates of greenhouse gas
output, on a per capita level,

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:20.255
it's the carbon equivalent of
adding two United States to the

00:27:20.255 --> 00:27:21.170
planet.
 

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.093
If we don't solve the
population problem,

00:27:23.093 --> 00:27:25.497
we're not going to solve the
climate crisis either,

00:27:25.497 --> 00:27:27.950
so there are a whole bunch of
things facing us.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.567
Now how do we address all of
these behavioral things,

00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:32.480
including the behavior of
Americans?

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.200
Well clearly the mass media is
influential.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.608
Is there anybody here who's
never watched television?

00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:42.940
No, now when I grew up we did
not have a television.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.143
They existed,
but my parents thought they

00:27:45.143 --> 00:27:47.623
were a bad idea,
and they may have been right,

00:27:47.623 --> 00:27:48.558
I don't know.
 

00:27:48.558 --> 00:27:51.940
We went over to our friend's
house and watched TV,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.284
but indeed, we listened to
radio programs and in many of

00:27:56.284 --> 00:28:00.313
the developing world countries,
people still spend their

00:28:00.313 --> 00:28:03.838
evenings listening to the radio
because they can't afford TVs.

00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:07.711
In Ethiopia only 4% of the
population can afford a

00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:11.980
television, but radio is
listened to by a vast majority

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.720
of the population.
 

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.972
In our programs we use
primarily radio,

00:28:16.972 --> 00:28:22.281
although this methodology that
I'm going to tell you about came

00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:25.278
out of the world of television.
 

00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:27.328
These are the countries in
which we have been working.

00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:30.670
We do long running serialized
dramas,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.608
sometimes referred to as soap
operas,

00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:37.261
in which characters evolve into
role models for the audience for

00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.147
elevation of women's status,
daughter education,

00:28:40.147 --> 00:28:43.960
use of family planning,
small family norms.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.127
We're looking at the idea of
applying this strategy in the

00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:52.515
United States to address climate
issues and teenage pregnancy

00:28:52.515 --> 00:28:53.319
issues.
 

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:54.759
We also do talk shows.
 

00:28:54.759 --> 00:28:59.384
We've produced print materials,
but it is the entertainment

00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:04.328
serialized dramas that are on
primetime in these countries,

00:29:04.328 --> 00:29:06.500
where we have the largest
audiences,

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.980
and therefore have the biggest
potential for impact.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.787
The creator of this methodology
is a Mexican producer named

00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:18.931
Miguel Sabido who was Vice
President of the biggest

00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:25.202
commercial network in Mexico,
Televisa, until his retirement

00:29:25.202 --> 00:29:26.240
in 1998.
 

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.105
In 1975, after looking at the
social learning theory of

00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:36.450
Stanford psychologist Albert
Bandura,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.821
who still is looking at how
role models influence behavior

00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:44.817
psychologically,
still is teaching at Stanford,

00:29:44.817 --> 00:29:49.636
and is probably the world's
best known psychologist and is

00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:54.118
the most frequently cited
psychologist in professional

00:29:54.118 --> 00:29:58.009
journal articles of those who
are living.

00:29:58.009 --> 00:30:02.570
He went up to actually
interview Bandura and went back

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:07.650
to Mexico to create a program to
promote adult education.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.260
He realized,
from his work in overseeing the

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.038
audience research division of
the network,

00:30:15.038 --> 00:30:19.440
that his programs were having a
huge impact on audience members,

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.828
so why not use them for good.
 

00:30:21.828 --> 00:30:25.588
He created a soap opera with
three subplots,

00:30:25.588 --> 00:30:30.348
one of which had illiterate
characters in it and the other

00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:35.358
two just were pure entertainment
with changes of fortune,

00:30:35.358 --> 00:30:37.670
and cliffhangers at the end of
each episode,

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.690
and all the stuff that goes
along with a soap opera.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.244
They were on at primetime,
or this program was on at

00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:48.428
primetime, it was called Ven
Conmigo, and it pulled in

00:30:48.428 --> 00:30:50.660
33% of the nation's viewers.
 

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.342
You know, melodrama is defined
as the battle of good versus

00:30:54.342 --> 00:30:56.320
evil,
so the evil characters were

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.101
telling the illiterate
characters that they were too

00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:02.316
old or too stupid to learn and
they should forget about that

00:31:02.316 --> 00:31:04.170
and stick with what they had.
 

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.749
The positive characters are
saying there's a whole

00:31:06.749 --> 00:31:08.750
infrastructure for adult
education,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.789
you ought to give it a try,
and you can master it,

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:12.598
you're not stupid.
 

00:31:12.598 --> 00:31:17.234
One by one these illiterate
characters decided to go to

00:31:17.234 --> 00:31:19.957
classes,
sign up and take the courses,

00:31:19.957 --> 00:31:23.663
and get their diplomas,
and when they did so their

00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:28.180
lives improved and this huge
audience witnessed this.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.423
Sabido then became intentional
in promoting this and he ran an

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:36.319
epilogue in which he gave
addresses of registration sites

00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:37.990
for adult education.
 

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.882
This epilogue followed the
episode in which his most

00:31:41.882 --> 00:31:45.240
popular character got his
diploma and it--

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.872
I don't speak Spanish and I
broke down in tears when I

00:31:48.872 --> 00:31:52.298
watched this episode because
it's so emotional,

00:31:52.298 --> 00:31:55.518
this man crying,
holding his diploma because

00:31:55.518 --> 00:31:59.634
finally he can read all the
letters he's gotten over the

00:31:59.634 --> 00:32:04.538
years from his granddaughter,
and then there's this epilogue.

00:32:04.538 --> 00:32:06.909
â€˜Perhaps you too would
like to do what this man has

00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:09.183
done,'
Sabido warned the Ministry of

00:32:09.183 --> 00:32:10.358
Public Education.
 

00:32:10.358 --> 00:32:13.244
He said, 'You may be aware of
the show I'm doing on Televisa,'

00:32:13.244 --> 00:32:15.584
and they said,
'yes we like it very much,

00:32:15.584 --> 00:32:18.890
and it's reinforcing our public
service announcements.'

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.675
He said, 'Well I may generate a
crowd because I'm going to run

00:32:22.675 --> 00:32:26.213
an advertisement after an
upcoming episode in which I give

00:32:26.213 --> 00:32:28.759
addresses of your registration
sites.

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.900
Can you handle a crowd?'
 

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.920
They said 'No problem.
 

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.403
Last year before your program
started we signed up 99,000

00:32:37.403 --> 00:32:42.366
people so we're set up to handle
large numbers,' so he ran that

00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:46.613
episode and the following day,
in a single day,

00:32:46.613 --> 00:32:52.025
250,000 people came in to try
to register and he continued to

00:32:52.025 --> 00:32:57.077
run epilogues for the remaining
weeks of that 260 episode

00:32:57.077 --> 00:32:58.250
program.
 

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.623
By the time it was done 840,000
people had signed up for adult

00:33:03.623 --> 00:33:04.680
education.
 

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.320
Then he did a program called
Acompá

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.090
ñame,
Come With Me,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.685
that promoted family planning,
as a solution to a problem of

00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:19.358
family harmony which is a
perfect subject for a melodrama;

00:33:19.358 --> 00:33:22.740
a couple arguing over how many
children to have and how to stay

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.904
out of poverty and so on and
they ultimately adopt a method

00:33:25.904 --> 00:33:28.960
of family planning and they live
happily ever after.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.134
similar impact on family
planning use and it was during

00:33:32.134 --> 00:33:34.368
that program that David
Poindexter,

00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:37.269
my colleague at Population
Institute,

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:42.808
discovered Sabido doing this
program in 1976.

00:33:42.808 --> 00:33:45.352
He did two things,
he convinced Emilio

00:33:45.352 --> 00:33:49.269
Azcárraga who owned
Televisa to have Sabido do four

00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:53.461
more telenovelas dealing with
teenage pregnancy prevention and

00:33:53.461 --> 00:33:58.734
family planning promotion,
and he took Sabido to meet

00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:01.509
Indira Gandhi in India.
 

00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:05.916
I had been in India in 1975
when she imposed involuntary

00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:10.403
sterilization around the country
and it caused the family

00:34:10.403 --> 00:34:13.849
planning efforts in India to
collapse,

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:17.389
and she lost the next election
as she should have.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.429
It was a total mess.
 

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:23.163
She was very concerned about
India's population problem but

00:34:23.163 --> 00:34:26.702
she didn't try the right
strategy and ultimately she got

00:34:26.702 --> 00:34:29.599
re-elected and before her
assassination,

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:31.268
Sabido was sitting in front of
her saying,

00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:33.889
you don't need to use coercion,
you can role model this,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.181
show people the benefits and
they'll decide for themselves

00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:38.280
whether to do it.
 

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.630
They ended up being sent to the
head of the Indian Television

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.500
Authority.
 

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.679
Sabido trained a writer,
Manohar Shyam Joshi who did

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:52.679
India's first home grown soap
opera which had huge impacts.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.954
it's the subject of a book
called, India's Information

00:34:55.954 --> 00:34:56.949
Revolution.
 

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:02.193
It pulled in between 65% and
90% of anybody who had access to

00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:02.630
TV.
 

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.284
It generated 400,000 letters
from viewers to the Indian

00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:09.458
Television Authority,
half of them addressed to

00:35:09.458 --> 00:35:12.766
characters by name,
with advice on who they should

00:35:12.766 --> 00:35:16.293
marry and so on,
but a lot of testimonials on

00:35:16.293 --> 00:35:20.610
how the program was impacting
the audience members.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:24.983
I got very interested in this
strategy and got involved in

00:35:24.983 --> 00:35:28.130
studying the second Indian soap
opera,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.601
which had huge effects on its
230 million viewers with regard

00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:36.775
to attitudes about age of
married women and acceptability

00:35:36.775 --> 00:35:40.280
of women in the workplace
outside the home.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.739
One of the reasons this
strategy has been so effective,

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:47.454
where it's been tried around
the world, is the long running

00:35:47.454 --> 00:35:49.119
nature of the program.
 

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:54.253
Because you can't get somebody
from say the status of a woman

00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:59.130
in Sudan to Gloria Steinem with
a 60 second public service

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.809
announcement or with a one hour
drama,

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:06.184
you really need time to bring
about meaningful change without

00:36:06.184 --> 00:36:07.309
creating backlash.
 

00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:11.750
By having gradual evolution of
the transitional characters and

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:16.045
only in response to situations
that the audience understands

00:36:16.045 --> 00:36:20.681
and themselves are experiencing,
can you bring about meaningful

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:21.199
change.
 

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:24.509
The emotional content of
melodrama is also very important

00:36:24.509 --> 00:36:28.469
for helping people remember what
they learned from the programs,

00:36:28.469 --> 00:36:32.949
as well as remembering the
program itself.

00:36:32.949 --> 00:36:37.202
Do you remember what you were
doing on the morning of

00:36:37.202 --> 00:36:38.840
September 11,2001?
 

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.041
Do you remember as clearly what
you were doing on the morning of

00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:45.280
September 10?
 

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.436
Now what psychologists tell us
is that emotional involvement

00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:49.400
enhances memory.
 

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.590
So, if you're highly involved
emotionally,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:55.012
in an emotionally based
melodrama and you learn lessons

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:57.315
from it,
you remember those for the rest

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.039
of your life.
 

00:36:58.039 --> 00:37:03.210
But if it's intellectual blah,
blah, blah it may last not much

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:08.126
longer than the final exam,
and I'm probably guilty of that

00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:09.059
myself.
 

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.907
There are several other
theories that Sabido

00:37:15.907 --> 00:37:19.159
incorporated into a theoretical
framework,

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:22.065
both psychological and
communication theories for the

00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.800
creation of this methodology.
 

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.413
I'm not going to take the time
now to talk about them but

00:37:27.413 --> 00:37:30.954
they're very interesting,
and I recommend you download

00:37:30.954 --> 00:37:34.797
this free book from our website
that has those theories spelled

00:37:34.797 --> 00:37:38.516
out as well as examples of this
strategy as it's been applied

00:37:38.516 --> 00:37:39.880
around the world.
 

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:46.960
Thato Ratsebe,
who is now working for

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:54.130
Population Media Center--she is
flying to Nairobi today.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:58.375
In Tanzania,
in 1993, I took Everett

00:37:58.375 --> 00:38:01.413
Rodgers,
who was then Associate Dean of

00:38:01.413 --> 00:38:04.536
the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University

00:38:04.536 --> 00:38:08.539
of Southern California,
and a research design scientist

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:12.684
from Minneapolis named Peter
Vaughn to help design an

00:38:12.684 --> 00:38:17.226
experimental evaluation to
measure the effects of a Sabido

00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:19.139
style radio serial.
 

00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:24.300
It was the second one done in
Africa and it was broadcast with

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.570
this pattern.
 

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.130
You can see the transmitting
towers,

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:32.840
the dots, and the shaded areas
around them are where you could

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.483
hear the signal,
but we intentionally chose

00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:40.498
early primetime when the tower
in Dodoma was broadcasting

00:38:40.498 --> 00:38:44.730
locally produced music with no
social or health content.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.190
Twice a week,
for two years,

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:51.043
a 208 episode program,
people in the shaded areas

00:38:51.043 --> 00:38:54.190
heard Twende Na Wakati,
Let's Go With The Times

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:59.206
or Let's Be Modern,
while in the control area they

00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:00.889
heard music.
 

00:39:00.889 --> 00:39:06.864
Among the characters in this
program was a negative character

00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:08.360
named Mkwaju.
 

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.226
He was an alcoholic truck
driver with a girlfriend at

00:39:12.226 --> 00:39:15.871
every truck stop and a
subservient wife named Tunu

00:39:15.871 --> 00:39:17.360
waiting at home.
 

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.610
He was, in Tanzanian society,
every man's ideal.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.110
This guy was a sexual athlete,
he was having a wonderful time,

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:31.074
he had girlfriends everywhere
draping over him at every truck

00:39:31.074 --> 00:39:33.780
stop,
and so it attracted a huge male

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.847
following,
more men than women in this

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:39.190
audience,
but overall 58% of the adult

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.389
population listening.
 

00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:45.005
Much to Mkwaju's surprise,
he found he was married to a

00:39:45.005 --> 00:39:46.679
transitional character.
 

00:39:46.679 --> 00:39:51.170
And Tunu, perhaps having read
some of the thousands of letters

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:55.585
addressed to her coming into
radio Tanzania advising her that

00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:59.623
her husband was cheating on her,
stood up to him when he was

00:39:59.623 --> 00:40:02.592
home on one of his visits and
told him she had heard about the

00:40:02.592 --> 00:40:03.420
AIDS epidemic.
 

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.806
She knew what he was up to on
the road and he was going to

00:40:06.806 --> 00:40:09.659
have to use condoms,
and she made that happen.

00:40:09.659 --> 00:40:13.516
She eventually took a job and
ultimately she founded her own

00:40:13.516 --> 00:40:17.570
business and became a role model
for female entrepreneurship in

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.420
Tanzania.
 

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:24.280
Now if you're a scriptwriter
you probably figured out Mkwaju

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.268
becomes sick,
for some time the audience

00:40:27.268 --> 00:40:29.260
doesn't know what has affected
him,

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.719
but they find out he now has
AIDS and Tunu throws him out,

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:39.541
but ultimately takes him back
and cares for him in a separate

00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:41.469
bedroom until he dies.
 

00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:47.000
The audience learned a few
lessons out of this.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.668
We did a nationwide,
random sample survey of 2,750

00:40:51.668 --> 00:40:55.393
people annually,
starting with a baseline just

00:40:55.393 --> 00:40:59.615
before going on the air and then
repeated annually for four years

00:40:59.615 --> 00:41:03.989
1993,
1994,1995, 1996 and 1997.

00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:08.170
From 1993 to 1995 this was the
pattern of broadcasting.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:12.130
From 1995 to 1997 we broadcast
the program in Dodoma,

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.882
so we were able to measure in
broadcast areas and

00:41:14.882 --> 00:41:18.092
non-broadcast areas what was
going on with regard to self

00:41:18.092 --> 00:41:21.590
reported knowledge,
attitudes and behavior.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:25.356
I also got the Ministry of
Health to ask new family

00:41:25.356 --> 00:41:29.349
planning adopters why they had
come to the clinics.

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:36.219
Now in the survey at the end of
year two,

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:38.630
58% of the adult population
listening,

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.818
82% of the listeners said the
program had caused them to

00:41:42.818 --> 00:41:46.400
change their behavior to avoid
HIV infection.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.710
We were astounded by how high
an impact it was.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.005
The most common change people
said they had made was reduction

00:41:55.005 --> 00:41:57.469
in the number of sexual
partners.

00:41:57.469 --> 00:42:02.240
We didn't have the budget to
hire enough private detectives

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.659
to verify those claims,
but we got the condom

00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:09.012
distribution data from the
National AIDS Control Program

00:42:09.012 --> 00:42:12.905
broken down by district,
and in the districts that made

00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:15.855
up the control area,
where they got all the national

00:42:15.855 --> 00:42:18.702
programs about AIDS,
except for this soap opera,

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:22.489
there was a 16% increase in
condom and distribution,

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:26.688
while in the broadcast areas
there was 153% increase in

00:42:26.688 --> 00:42:28.400
condom distribution.
 

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.393
Now when we took all of the
reported behavior changes across

00:42:32.393 --> 00:42:36.590
the country and extrapolated it
to wherever you could hear this

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.726
program,
the cost per person who changed

00:42:39.726 --> 00:42:43.150
behavior to avoid HIV infection
was $0.08 U.S.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:48.550
On family planning we saw a 10%
increase in the number of family

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:53.951
planning adopters in the initial
broadcast areas and zero change

00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:58.579
in the control area around the
Dodoma transmitter.

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:03.208
When we broadcast the program
in Dodoma, the following two

00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:07.920
years we had a 16% increase in
family planning adoption.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.132
And in both areas,
at the times the broadcasts

00:43:11.132 --> 00:43:15.320
were on the air in those areas,
41% of the new adopters named

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.929
the program as their reason for
coming in.

00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:22.090
The next most impactful
intervention was named by 11%,

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.485
so a 4:1 ratio of effects
between this soap opera and the

00:43:26.485 --> 00:43:29.389
next most impactful
intervention.

00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:32.092
Now it was right after seeing
this data that I started

00:43:32.092 --> 00:43:34.539
Population Media Center and I
took Rose Haji,

00:43:34.539 --> 00:43:37.030
who produced the Tanzanian
program,

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.824
Tom Kazungu who was the first
African trained by Sabido and

00:43:40.824 --> 00:43:43.179
the first radio person to use
it,

00:43:43.179 --> 00:43:45.670
and Sabido himself to Ethiopia.
 

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:49.539
We trained a team of writers to
produce two programs,

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:53.199
one in Amharic,
the national language which was

00:43:53.199 --> 00:43:58.369
257 episodes long and the second
one 140 episodes in Oromiffa,

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:01.525
the second most common
language, and those were on the

00:44:01.525 --> 00:44:04.860
air for two and a half years
starting in June of 2002.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.063
The Amharic program was
listened to by 47% of men,

00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.349
45% of women.
 

00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:15.478
The Oromiffa program pulled in
another 25% of the population,

00:44:15.478 --> 00:44:20.094
so we had well over 40 million
people listening to this

00:44:20.094 --> 00:44:21.119
program.
 

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:24.476
It became the subject of daily
conversations,

00:44:24.476 --> 00:44:27.070
as well as thousands of
letters;

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.565
15,000 poured into our office
in Addis Ababa during the time

00:44:30.565 --> 00:44:32.518
these programs were on the air.
 

00:44:32.518 --> 00:44:36.590
Most of them in response to the
Amharic language program which

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.260
had a better time slot.
 

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:43.344
One of those letters was from a
woman who said she was so happy

00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:48.510
we had addressed the issue of
marriage by abduction because,

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.768
you may not know this,
but in rural Ethiopia the

00:44:51.768 --> 00:44:55.514
status of women is so low that
it's considered socially

00:44:55.514 --> 00:44:59.329
acceptable for a man to grab a
girl off the street.

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.889
And I mean a school girl,
take her home and rape her,

00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:06.335
and then she's considered to be
his wife and she's stuck with

00:45:06.335 --> 00:45:09.300
her abductor for the rest of her
life.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.625
And parent's won't take the
daughters back because they're

00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:13.869
damaged goods and it would bring
shame on the family.

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:16.949
So they leave the girls with
these abductors.

00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:20.661
Now this is starting to change
and courts are starting to allow

00:45:20.661 --> 00:45:22.099
these women to escape.
 

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:25.456
We dealt with this in this very
popular program and this letter

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.994
said,
'Thank you so much for dealing

00:45:27.994 --> 00:45:32.277
with the issue of marriage by
abduction through your character

00:45:32.277 --> 00:45:32.980
Wubahn.
 

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.454
Our own daughter was abducted
on her way to school at age 14

00:45:36.454 --> 00:45:40.047
and ended up married as a result
and we've been afraid to send

00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:43.581
our 12 year old girls to school
for fear the same thing would

00:45:43.581 --> 00:45:44.820
happen to them.
 

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.920
When your program played and
dealt with this issue the entire

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.780
village which had listened to
it,

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.338
came together,
and we agreed to enforce the

00:45:52.338 --> 00:45:55.570
law against marriage by
abduction and it's now safe to

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:58.130
send our 12 year old girls to
school.'

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.106
This is the kind of qualitative
information we got from those

00:46:02.106 --> 00:46:02.768
letters.
 

00:46:02.768 --> 00:46:06.351
We also had listening groups
that filled out diaries after

00:46:06.351 --> 00:46:10.182
each episode and periodic focus
group discussions for feedback

00:46:10.182 --> 00:46:13.806
to the writers,
and monitoring through 14,400

00:46:13.806 --> 00:46:18.949
exit interviews at reproductive
health clinics to ask people why

00:46:18.949 --> 00:46:21.780
they had come,
and a baseline and

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.940
post-broadcast quantitative
survey across the country.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.630
At the 48 clinics where those
14,000 exit interviews were

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.612
carried out,
63% of the new reproductive

00:46:32.612 --> 00:46:36.820
health clients were listening to
the program or one of the

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.148
programs,
and over a fourth of the new

00:46:40.148 --> 00:46:44.123
clients cited one of the
programs as the primary

00:46:44.123 --> 00:46:47.000
motivator for seeking services.
 

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.264
Radio Ethiopia has 100% public
service broadcasting and a lot

00:46:51.264 --> 00:46:54.960
of programs dealing with AIDS
and family planning.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.731
Of all the people who named
Radio Ethiopia or other radio

00:46:58.731 --> 00:47:01.911
programs,
96% named one of our programs,

00:47:01.911 --> 00:47:06.262
4% named any of the other
programs on the radio as their

00:47:06.262 --> 00:47:08.159
source of motivation.
 

00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:13.576
This shows increase in use of
family planning from baseline to

00:47:13.576 --> 00:47:17.637
non-listeners to listeners,
the increase among the

00:47:17.637 --> 00:47:21.577
listeners was more than double
the increase among non-listeners

00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:24.119
and highly statistically
significant.

00:47:24.119 --> 00:47:27.764
Some of the non-listeners were
clearly motivated through

00:47:27.764 --> 00:47:29.820
conversations with listeners.
 

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:34.333
Now this is a decrease in not
knowing how to determine ones

00:47:34.333 --> 00:47:38.614
HIV status and this is actual
reporting of going for HIV

00:47:38.614 --> 00:47:43.438
testing: male listeners sought
HIV tests at four times the rate

00:47:43.438 --> 00:47:47.255
of non-listeners;
female listeners sought tests

00:47:47.255 --> 00:47:50.190
at three times the rate of
non-listeners.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:54.639
Now we've done similar work in
these countries.

00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.173
In Vietnam we're currently on
the air with a program dealing

00:47:58.173 --> 00:48:00.570
with HIV/Aids on The Voice of
Vietnam.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:04.659
In West Africa we did a program
dealing with child slavery.

00:48:04.659 --> 00:48:07.994
It was actually something that
was brought about through a

00:48:07.994 --> 00:48:10.862
request by Ben &amp;
Jerry's and funding from them

00:48:10.862 --> 00:48:14.550
to get started and then funding
from the U.S. Government.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:19.090
We measured a quintupling of
awareness among listeners of the

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.646
problem of child
trafficking/child slavery and a

00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:27.489
doubling of interventions by
listeners to stop the practice.

00:48:27.489 --> 00:48:31.228
We've just gone on the air in
Mali with a program promoting

00:48:31.228 --> 00:48:32.389
family planning.
 

00:48:32.389 --> 00:48:35.739
We've done two programs in
Nigeria,

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:40.927
the first one was at the
request of the Rotarian Action

00:48:40.927 --> 00:48:46.115
Group on Population and
Development that was setting up

00:48:46.115 --> 00:48:51.208
a surgery to offer repair for
women who have obstetric

00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:54.489
fistula,
something that results from the

00:48:54.489 --> 00:48:58.050
daughter's in northern Nigeria
being married off at age 9 and

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.652
getting pregnant at age 12,
and trying to deliver with an

00:49:01.652 --> 00:49:04.449
immature pelvis and having
obstructed labor,

00:49:04.449 --> 00:49:09.489
and ending up somewhat torn to
shreds and incontinent.

00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:12.605
These girls married to older
men in polygamous marriages

00:49:12.605 --> 00:49:16.400
generally then get thrown out on
the street and live as beggars,

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.422
and the Rotary Clubs of
northern Nigeria set up a

00:49:19.422 --> 00:49:22.070
surgical center to repair them
because,

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:26.409
for $300, these women can be
returned to a normal life.

00:49:26.409 --> 00:49:31.130
If they are unrepaired,
they're incontinent and they

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:34.739
live on the streets,
and they smell bad,

00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:37.610
and they're social pariahs.
 

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:42.215
In fact, there are 800,000
women in Nigeria with unrepaired

00:49:42.215 --> 00:49:43.090
fistulas.
 

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:47.690
We were able to measure,
by promoting family planning,

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.750
and delaying marriage and
childbearing to adulthood,

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:53.916
a third of the women coming to
family planning clinics named

00:49:53.916 --> 00:49:56.170
our program as their reason for
coming,

00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:00.148
and 54% of the women coming for
surgical repair named the

00:50:00.148 --> 00:50:03.559
program as the reason they were
at the clinic.

00:50:03.559 --> 00:50:07.030
The second program,
that's on the air currently,

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:11.240
is being named by 67% of family
planning adopters as their

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.900
motivation for seeking services.
 

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.472
In Rwanda, currently 57% of
family planning clients and 59%

00:50:18.472 --> 00:50:23.358
of HIV testing clients name our
program as their motivation for

00:50:23.358 --> 00:50:25.329
coming to the clinic.
 

00:50:25.329 --> 00:50:30.896
We're also using the program to
promote preservation of mountain

00:50:30.896 --> 00:50:33.989
gorilla habitat,
and more generally,

00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.730
wilderness areas in Rwanda.
 

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:42.342
In Sudan, the program addressed
the issue of female genital

00:50:42.342 --> 00:50:43.599
mutilation.
 

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:49.179
Opposition to FGM in Sudan at
the time that program was on the

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:54.030
air went from 28% to 65% by the
end of the program.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:58.266
In Niger we dealt with child
trafficking also and in Senegal

00:50:58.266 --> 00:51:02.574
we've just gone on the air with
two programs in two different

00:51:02.574 --> 00:51:03.579
languages.
 

00:51:03.579 --> 00:51:04.380
In the U.S.
 

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.659
we're working with the
Hollywood community,

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:10.460
in partnership with the Academy
of Television Arts &amp;

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.059
Sciences and the Screenwriter's
Guild of America.

00:51:13.059 --> 00:51:17.878
We've done two briefings for
members of the Screenwriter's

00:51:17.878 --> 00:51:20.507
Guild,
the most recent one on climate,

00:51:20.507 --> 00:51:23.304
population,
health and security issues,

00:51:23.304 --> 00:51:27.411
we held in Hollywood in
November and the one before that

00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:31.815
about a year and a half ago at
Emory School of Public Health

00:51:31.815 --> 00:51:35.547
looking at the role of
entertainment television and

00:51:35.547 --> 00:51:38.460
addressing public health issues.
 

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:42.000
These are countries in which we
are developing projects.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.097
I was in Papua,
New Guinea and Uganda in the

00:51:45.097 --> 00:51:48.989
development of new projects in
the last two months,

00:51:48.989 --> 00:51:53.003
but we have projects in various
stages of development in each of

00:51:53.003 --> 00:51:54.150
these countries.
 

00:51:54.150 --> 00:52:00.469
Now how are we on time?
 

00:52:00.469 --> 00:52:02.960
Why don't I take just a few
minutes and show you,

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:09.634
if I can make this work,
a clip from a documentary done

00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:14.949
by a CNN Vice President for
Environment,

00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:19.242
no longer with CNN but she was
head of Environment for CNN and

00:52:19.242 --> 00:52:20.789
Turner Broadcasting.
 

00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:28.056
A woman named Barbara Pile who
did a documentary on this idea

00:52:28.056 --> 00:52:35.204
of social content soap operas in
the Philippines where Cecil

00:52:35.204 --> 00:52:38.960
Alvarez produced a program.
 

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.297
I'm not sure if I'm going to be
able to put this on full screen

00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:43.159
but let's see.
 

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.898
This is a documentary about
this Philippine program

00:53:59.898 --> 00:54:03.610
introduced by Jane Fonda and
then the documentary is by

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:04.780
Barbara Pile.
 

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.570
The storyline is about two
sisters,

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:12.864
one of whom elopes at I think
the age of 16 and has a baby

00:54:12.864 --> 00:54:18.719
every year trying to please her
husband who wants a son and it's

00:54:18.719 --> 00:57:42.159
a tragedy
&lt;&lt;video clip

00:57:42.159 --> 01:01:49.219
54:25-1:01:50&gt;&gt;
 

01:01:49.219 --> 01:01:51.409
Well that fixed that.
 

01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:52.800
Are there lights?
 

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.119
Thank you.
 

01:01:58.119 --> 01:02:03.085
That's a half hour documentary
but you saw the part about it

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:06.960
that is on that soap opera,
and I guess with that I thank

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.710
you for your attention and I'd
be happy to take questions.

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.239
Are there any questions or
comments?

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:20.592
Prof: What happened that
there's so--in America you have

01:02:20.592 --> 01:02:22.809
a soap opera once a week for an
hour--

01:02:22.809 --> 01:02:24.239
William Ryerson:
 Well some are daily.

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:25.300
Prof: Some are daily?
 

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.969
William Ryerson:
 Daytime.

01:02:26.969 --> 01:02:28.679
Prof: You see those too,
right?

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:30.108
How is it that--is that the
standard mood in

01:02:30.108 --> 01:02:31.039
&gt;?
 

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.393
William Ryerson:
 It varies all over the

01:02:32.393 --> 01:02:32.630
place.
 

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.920
In Latin America,
its daily, daytime and

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.239
primetime.
 

01:02:38.239 --> 01:02:41.260
In many countries it's twice a
week.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.882
Some are once a week,
but once a week is really not

01:02:43.882 --> 01:02:46.976
adequate because you have to
hold the audiences interest for

01:02:46.976 --> 01:02:49.702
a whole week waiting for the
resolution of the latest

01:02:49.702 --> 01:02:51.990
cliffhanger,
so we like to do a minimum of

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:53.596
twice a week,
and some of them are three

01:02:53.596 --> 01:02:54.099
times a week.
 

01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:59.429
Yes.
 

01:02:59.429 --> 01:03:03.217
Student:  If you--if
you're like having a program for

01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:07.070
like two years how do you draw
people in and say it's halfway

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:10.728
through the show or a quarter
ways, how do you continue to

01:03:10.728 --> 01:03:12.719
inspire the new audience?
 

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:17.597
William Ryerson:  Well--
The question was how do we deal

01:03:17.597 --> 01:03:21.858
with people who are drawn into
the program halfway through a

01:03:21.858 --> 01:03:23.518
two-year soap opera?
 

01:03:23.518 --> 01:03:26.882
The answer is one of the
beauties about having several

01:03:26.882 --> 01:03:30.751
hundred episodes is you can have
a lot of discussion of what's

01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:33.480
gone on in the past by the
characters,

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.570
so people who join the audience
partway through the two or three

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:43.175
years that it might be on the
air learn a lot about it and

01:03:43.175 --> 01:03:47.456
they also may learn about it
from other members of the

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:48.750
community.
 

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:51.849
Particularly in countries where
we have very high listenership,

01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:56.820
like northern Nigeria,
our most recent measure was 82%

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.510
of the adult population is
listening every week.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.909
There it's become a cultural
event,

01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:08.601
so people who are joining it
hear both about the program from

01:04:08.601 --> 01:04:11.972
their neighbors,
as well as hearing characters

01:04:11.972 --> 01:04:16.150
talking about the past and
getting caught up that way.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:19.554
One of the questions I'm often
asked and maybe I should wait

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:22.730
until somebody asks me this
question is how do we decide

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:24.518
what it is we're promoting.
 

01:04:24.518 --> 01:04:28.070
In a sense, what gives us,
as an American organization,

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.557
the right to go into some
country and tell them how to

01:04:31.557 --> 01:04:32.150
live?
 

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:37.231
Indeed, one of the things that
we've adopted as a strategy is

01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:40.789
looking at the policies of each
country;

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:44.775
most countries are signatories
of the Cairo Program of Action

01:04:44.775 --> 01:04:48.762
on Population and Development,
and of the Beijing Platform of

01:04:48.762 --> 01:04:50.690
Action on Women's Rights.
 

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:54.637
If they're a signatory of those
documents then part of their

01:04:54.637 --> 01:04:58.586
national policy is incorporated
in those documents which are

01:04:58.586 --> 01:05:02.668
really global agreements on the
rights and status of women and

01:05:02.668 --> 01:05:04.409
reproductive health.
 

01:05:04.409 --> 01:05:07.987
So, we use that as a starting
point as the basis for the

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.980
values that will be promoted by
the program.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.480
Then the policies of the
country may add nuances to that,

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.103
so when we go into a country,
we explain to them we are there

01:05:19.103 --> 01:05:21.460
to help them promote their
policies,

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.510
we're not trying to impose
something from the outside.

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:25.750
Yes.
 

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.610
Student:  Well I was
going to actually ask how--do

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.635
you find that you have a lot of
opposition from governments or

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:30.400
other institutions?
 

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.909
William Ryerson:
 Hardly any.

01:05:32.909 --> 01:05:34.994
William Ryerson:
 The question was do we

01:05:34.994 --> 01:05:36.579
have opposition from
governments?

01:05:36.579 --> 01:05:40.981
One of the things about this
strategy is, because we're

01:05:40.981 --> 01:05:44.568
working to support the
government's policies,

01:05:44.568 --> 01:05:47.829
they are very enthusiastic
about it.

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:51.934
Second, we get very little
opposition from the public

01:05:51.934 --> 01:05:56.512
because of the very gradual
evolution of the characters and

01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:58.824
because,
by doing our homework and

01:05:58.824 --> 01:06:02.010
really understanding the culture
before we ever get started,

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:04.340
and having writers from that
culture,

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.409
all of our programs are
written, produced,

01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:08.889
and managed by country
nationals.

01:06:08.889 --> 01:06:12.639
We know what the taboos are and
we steer clear of those,

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:15.679
so we're not there to give
people shock therapy,

01:06:15.679 --> 01:06:21.025
we're there to start where they
are and move in the direction of

01:06:21.025 --> 01:06:25.099
better reproductive health and
women's rights.

01:06:25.099 --> 01:06:29.760
We don't do it in a way that
creates backlash or opposition.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.840
Yes.
 

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.559
Student:  The Twilight
books and Seventh Heaven,

01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:38.137
shows like that,
I was wondering if people say

01:06:38.137 --> 01:06:40.393
that they are--
they were made to promote

01:06:40.393 --> 01:06:42.487
things like abstinence and
Seventh Heaven was always

01:06:42.487 --> 01:06:45.010
doing 'don't drink,
don't smoke' episodes.

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:48.384
I'm wondering how you think
they relate to the programs that

01:06:48.384 --> 01:06:49.300
you guys show?
 

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.789
William Ryerson:
 The question is,

01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:55.849
with American shows like
Seventh Heaven are we--

01:06:55.849 --> 01:07:00.780
what's the comparison between
their strategy for promoting not

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.954
drinking and driving,
or abstinence with the kinds of

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.539
programs we're doing?
 

01:07:06.539 --> 01:07:09.389
The answer is,
there is some comparison.

01:07:09.389 --> 01:07:13.045
That is, producers and writers
of American Hollywood shows are

01:07:13.045 --> 01:07:16.641
members of society and they're
parents and they're very aware

01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:21.728
of some of the problems,
and sometimes they attempt to

01:07:21.728 --> 01:07:27.268
address issues in the context of
their program.

01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:32.219
We had Neil Bear as a speaker
at an event we did at Hofstra

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:36.742
University about a month ago who
produces Law &amp;

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:41.179
Order and also was a
producer of ER,

01:07:41.179 --> 01:07:45.489
and there are very intentional
efforts to use some of these

01:07:45.489 --> 01:07:48.239
programs to promote positive
goals.

01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:52.831
They tend to do so in one or a
few episodes as opposed to

01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:57.670
having a program that's designed
around a set of issues,

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:01.597
so it tends to be briefer
mentions of these issues and

01:08:01.597 --> 01:08:05.750
sometimes they're done well and
sometimes they're not.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:10.478
Indeed, there are lots of
examples of entertainment shows

01:08:10.478 --> 01:08:14.871
in Hollywood like the Bold
&amp; The Beautiful

01:08:14.871 --> 01:08:19.854
addressing HIV/AIDS through a
character named Tony who finds

01:08:19.854 --> 01:08:22.220
out he's HIV positive.
 

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.775
They got an 800 number from
Donna Shalala when she was

01:08:25.775 --> 01:08:29.466
Secretary of Health &amp;
Human Services that they could

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:34.029
run after those key episodes for
people to call for information.

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:38.229
That show generated more calls
to that 800 number than the

01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:42.721
60 Minutes' treatment of
HIV/AIDs and 60 Minutes

01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:46.985
has a much bigger audience,
but it was the emotional impact

01:08:46.985 --> 01:08:50.921
of Days of Our Lives that
generated a huge response by the

01:08:50.921 --> 01:08:51.658
audience.
 

01:08:51.658 --> 01:08:54.953
So, some of these have been
very useful interventions,

01:08:54.953 --> 01:08:58.310
but they're quite different in
terms of methodology.

01:08:58.310 --> 01:08:59.560
Yes?
 

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.507
Student:  Do you do
follow up studies and is there

01:09:02.507 --> 01:09:05.403
any evidence to show that the
contraception doesn't just

01:09:05.403 --> 01:09:07.123
like--
contraception doesn't just

01:09:07.123 --> 01:09:09.881
increase immediately after the
show but continues years after

01:09:09.881 --> 01:09:11.488
the shows have gone off the air.
 

01:09:11.488 --> 01:09:13.408
William Ryerson:
 There is some evidence.

01:09:13.408 --> 01:09:16.840
Of course you're asking a
fundraising question.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.532
It is hard to get grants for
say a ten year study,

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:24.310
but there is some evidence.
 

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:26.854
For example,
with Sabido's family planning

01:09:26.854 --> 01:09:30.215
programs,
they stopped addressing family

01:09:30.215 --> 01:09:35.783
planning issues at Televisa,
unrelated to the controversy or

01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:37.689
not of the content.
 

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:43.536
They stopped doing social
content broadcasting at Televisa

01:09:43.536 --> 01:09:49.279
in 1985, and the birthrate had
come down dramatically.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:52.068
It was the most dramatic
decline in birthrates of any

01:09:52.068 --> 01:09:55.123
developing country in the
twentieth century during the ten

01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:58.233
years Sabido's five family
planning soap operas were on the

01:09:58.233 --> 01:09:58.770
air.
 

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:02.148
When they stopped,
the birthrate plateaued,

01:10:02.148 --> 01:10:04.399
but it did not go back up.
 

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:09.431
However, our view is because
there are new generations coming

01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:13.435
along every year,
and because people continue to

01:10:13.435 --> 01:10:17.546
need information on a whole
range of health and social

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:20.413
issues,
these programs should be seen

01:10:20.413 --> 01:10:22.430
as a long-term intervention.
 

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.997
We shouldn't say do a program
for three years and then walk

01:10:25.997 --> 01:10:27.679
away,
in the same way that we

01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:30.988
wouldn't open a clinic for three
years and then close it down and

01:10:30.988 --> 01:10:33.420
hope that the birthrate wouldn't
go back up.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.550
We really see this as a long
term intervention,

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:40.198
but the evidence that we have
is probably not conclusive,

01:10:40.198 --> 01:10:45.314
but it appears that these
programs lead to permanent

01:10:45.314 --> 01:10:47.119
change in norms.
 

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:48.010
Yes?
 

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.779
Student:  Do you ever
find yourself at a competitive

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:53.213
disadvantage to the more
traditional commercial soap

01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:53.738
operas?
 

01:10:53.738 --> 01:10:56.840
William Ryerson:
 Certainly in countries

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.939
that have a mature media market
like India,

01:10:59.939 --> 01:11:03.243
like Brazil,
we are adopting more a strategy

01:11:03.243 --> 01:11:08.161
of working with the producers of
existing programs than trying to

01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:10.618
produce our own and compete.
 

01:11:10.618 --> 01:11:14.265
In Brazil, for example,
we're working in partnership

01:11:14.265 --> 01:11:18.270
with the social merchandising
department of TV Globo,

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:22.140
which controls 65% of the
Brazilian audience.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:26.067
That strategy--actually their
department emerged because of

01:11:26.067 --> 01:11:29.655
the partnership we formed
originally through a meeting

01:11:29.655 --> 01:11:33.650
David Poindexter and I had with
Roberto Murino who owned the

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:37.578
network and it was being done
through the product placement

01:11:37.578 --> 01:11:38.729
division.
 

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:42.131
But ultimately they set up a
whole division to promote social

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.936
causes through the telenovelas,
and so we helped them do that

01:11:45.936 --> 01:11:47.750
and we measure the effects.
 

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.320
For example,
36% of the women at Planned

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.634
Parenthood clinics in Brazil
were there because of one soap

01:11:56.634 --> 01:12:01.579
opera we evaluated called
Paginas Da Vida,

01:12:01.579 --> 01:12:05.750
Pages of Life.
 

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.470
It's similar to what we're
doing in Hollywood.

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:10.510
We're not--We may do a You Tube
soap opera,

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:14.288
but we're not likely to get
ourselves on the air on CBS,

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:20.247
so we're instead focusing on
working with writers of existing

01:12:20.247 --> 01:12:21.340
programs.
 

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.198
Yes?
 

01:12:23.198 --> 01:12:26.050
Student:  I'm curious
about the range of social issues

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.000
of your audiences.
 

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.654
I mean if they're writing into
the characters and addressing

01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:31.408
them by name and giving
suggestions,

01:12:31.408 --> 01:12:33.430
they may not be so savvy about
the media,

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:39.609
I'm wondering if that helps or
hinders your project or both?

01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:43.447
William Ryerson:
 It's a question that we

01:12:43.447 --> 01:12:47.529
try to understand before we ever
go on the air,

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.430
what are their attitudes,
perceptions of,

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:56.010
and consumption of
entertainment media.

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:59.060
Indeed, the audience is,
in terms of their

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.676
sophistication and their media
savvy varied dramatically from a

01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:07.100
place like Ethiopia to a place
like India.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:13.010
There's no one generalization,
but there are many stories

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:16.810
about our experiences in
Ethiopia.

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:19.302
For example,
the actress who played the

01:13:19.302 --> 01:13:23.109
positive female role model
Furkurta in that first program I

01:13:23.109 --> 01:13:26.623
was talking about,
went into a vegetable market

01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:30.420
and women recognized her voice
from the radio show,

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.520
and one of them said you're
Furkurta and she said,

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.907
well not really,
and they said no,

01:13:34.907 --> 01:13:36.832
no,
no we know you're Furkurta,

01:13:36.832 --> 01:13:39.560
we recognize you from Yeken
Kignit,

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.765
and one of them said,
I named my baby daughter after

01:13:42.765 --> 01:13:46.350
you in hopes that she would be
as wonderful as you are.

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:50.055
Clearly there--they are not
seeing the distinction between

01:13:50.055 --> 01:13:52.832
fantasy and reality,
but on the other hand,

01:13:52.832 --> 01:13:56.390
how many times have you heard
this about American audiences?

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:00.404
It's hard to know really,
but clearly,

01:14:00.404 --> 01:14:05.938
probably the lack of
sophistication leads to greater

01:14:05.938 --> 01:14:11.579
influence of the programs but
it's hard to know.

01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:13.100
One more question.
 

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.814
Student:  How do you
feel applying those models to

01:14:15.814 --> 01:14:18.529
other social issues such as
environmental degradation?

01:14:18.529 --> 01:14:21.435
Because it--I mean family
planning is really based on

01:14:21.435 --> 01:14:24.731
family relationships and how
people relate to each other and

01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:27.962
how do you see--
I guess how do you--what's your

01:14:27.962 --> 01:14:32.050
belief of what the success rate
of these programs will be--

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:35.193
if it's more on environment
issues or other type of social

01:14:35.193 --> 01:14:35.800
justices?
 

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.208
William Ryerson:
 The question is how do we

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:41.355
feel about applying the strategy
to other issues like environment

01:14:41.355 --> 01:14:44.158
as opposed to family life and
family planning issues?

01:14:44.158 --> 01:14:46.399
The answer is we feel great
about it,

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:51.109
however, you point out it might
not be the most exciting soap

01:14:51.109 --> 01:14:54.328
opera to do a soap opera on
recycling,

01:14:54.328 --> 01:14:57.786
so it doesn't have the same sex
appeal or audience appeal as a

01:14:57.786 --> 01:15:01.770
program about people's lives,
so we mix issues and we like to

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:04.500
do programs about life in the
country.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.786
In the eastern Caribbean,
the nine countries where we're

01:15:07.786 --> 01:15:11.221
broadcasting a program,
that program is addressing both

01:15:11.221 --> 01:15:14.743
family planning and preservation
of the rain forests of the

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:16.020
eastern Caribbean.
 

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:18.920
In Rwanda, similarly.
 

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.213
We're planning a program in
Papua New Guinea that will

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:26.130
address conservation of marine
resources and family planning.

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:31.908
Clearly, family life issues are
a perfect subject for melodrama.

01:15:31.908 --> 01:15:36.155
You have to be very careful how
much conservation kinds of

01:15:36.155 --> 01:15:41.453
content you put into a program,
but indeed, you can have the

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:45.010
life of a village in a soap
opera,

01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:48.105
and for example,
in Papua, New Guinea one of the

01:15:48.105 --> 01:15:51.860
fishing practices that is
clearly a short term strategy is

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.813
to use dynamite to blow up the
reef and it stuns all the fish

01:15:55.813 --> 01:15:58.908
and they can scoop them out of
the ocean.

01:15:58.908 --> 01:16:01.630
That's not a sustainable
livelihood,

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:05.728
so we can demonstrate that
through a two year soap opera in

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:10.109
a way that might take many more
years and be devastating to the

01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:15.182
marine environment if it--
if people just wait until

01:16:15.182 --> 01:16:17.310
they're starving.
 

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:21.358
The point is well taken,
it's something where we have to

01:16:21.358 --> 01:16:25.257
be careful not to overload it
with messages and boring

01:16:25.257 --> 01:16:28.548
information,
it really has to remain an

01:16:28.548 --> 01:16:32.078
exciting program or we'll lose
our audience.

01:16:32.078 --> 01:16:35.268
Well I think we better call it
quits because we're past

01:16:35.268 --> 01:16:36.390
adjournment time.
 

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.359
I thank you all very much.
 

01:16:38.359 --> 01:16:42.100

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.321
Professor John Rogers:
I'm actually going to

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.888
continue here one of the
discussions that I had begun in

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:12.348
the last lecture,
which involved the matter of

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:16.320
the relationship of this poem,
Paradise Regained,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.901
to the earlier epic,
which we have to acknowledge is

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:24.400
in so many ways the more
ambitious poem,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.355
Paradise Lost.
I want to look at the way in

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:30.510
which Milton uses this new poem,
Paradise Regained,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.841
to explore the larger
problem of identity and in a lot

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:41.735
of ways, the identity of Milton
himself: Milton's identity as an

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:48.590
obedient son of God,
Milton's identity as a poet.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.760
All of this gets worked out
over the course of the poem.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.214
Each of the characters in
Paradise Regained,

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:58.096
Satan and the Son -- each
of them is involved in an

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.782
elaborate process,
and it's really a process that

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:06.220
spans the entire poem,
of trying to figure out who the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.837
other one is.
On top of that,

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:13.606
each of them is trying to
figure out who he himself is --

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.780
or who he himself has been,
in the Son's case.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.321
I don't know what page this is
on, but it's in Book One,

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:39.469
lines 355 and 356.
This is the Son speaking to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.497
Satan, and I think it's an
extraordinary thing for the Son

00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:51.311
to say.
The Son says to Satan:

00:01:51.311 --> 00:02:01.404
"Why dost thou then suggest to
me distrust, / knowing who I am,

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:08.534
as I know who thou art?"
Of course, we are -- how can we

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:11.141
not be?
-- inclined to assume,

00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:15.721
because this is the Son of God
after all, that there's

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:21.080
something more meaningful about
this statement than actually is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.419
the case.
What does the Son know?

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:29.148
The Son does know that Satan is
his enemy and that Satan is to

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:34.690
be identified with that serpent
from the Protoevangelium,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.936
 the prophecy back in
Genesis whom it will be the

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:44.028
Son's job to destroy.
The Son knows that,

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:50.025
and Satan knows that the Son is
his enemy and that it will be

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:55.822
the Son's job as the Messiah to
destroy him.But this is

00:02:55.822 --> 00:03:00.613
still just a partial knowledge,
and it's remarkable,

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.016
the extent to which Milton
doesn't let on just how partial

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.286
this knowledge is.
We don't know until the end how

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.473
little the Son and Satan
actually understand about

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:15.033
themselves and about each other.
And so I think the Son is

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:20.512
actually wrong in some way at
this early point in the poem to

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:23.800
claim that he knows who Satan
is,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.346
because his is,
of course, just a partial

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:28.122
knowledge.
Satan doesn't know fully who

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:32.830
the Son is, and the Son doesn't
know fully who Satan is.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.697
Each of them on some level
knows who the other is,

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:41.511
but neither of them knows who
the other has been -- I'm

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:46.563
hoping that will make more sense
by the time we get to the end of

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:50.697
our period here.Okay.
So what little action,

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:54.916
what little drama this poem
affords us -- and we have to

00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:59.979
confess it is relatively little
-- involves just this struggle,

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.159
this intellectual struggle to
understand one's identity.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.730
I think that the search for
identity represented in the poem

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.030
in a lot of ways is a reflection
of,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.710
or something like a narrative
version of, Milton's own

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.529
attempts -- and we've been
tracking this for a long time

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.209
now -- Milton's own attempts to
identify himself.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.066
So one of the questions I think
at stake here is who is John

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.579
Milton?
Who is this man?

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.388
Who is this man who dared to
rewrite scripture in his

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:37.269
twelve-book epic poem
Paradise Lost?I think

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:41.589
this poem is everywhere trying
to answer that question,

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:43.940
and it begins answering it at
the very opening.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.459
Look at the beginning of
Paradise Regained.

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.319
This is page 483 of the
Hughes.

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.893
I [and obviously,
this is Milton the narrator

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:58.826
talking to us]
who erewhile the happy Garden

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:02.496
sung,
By one mans disobedience lost,

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:05.533
now sing
Recover'd Paradise to all

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:08.990
mankind,
By one mans firm obedience

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.683
fully triedâ€¦
Obviously Milton is drawing our

00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:17.208
attention to the earlier
achievement, the epic that had

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:19.820
begun with that prepositional
phrase,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.063
"of man's first disobedience."
So the poet very carefully

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:30.866
wrings a variation on that
phrase in the forced line of the

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:36.250
new poem, and the new phrase is
"by one's man firm obedience."

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.714
This little modulation
reflects, of course,

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:43.920
the change of subject
matter.But look at the way

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.787
in which Milton has -- this is
unbelievable to me -- look at

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:53.653
how he has characterized his
authorship of the earlier poem:

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:57.529
"I who erewhile the happy
Garden sung."

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.442
Now just pause for a moment and
think about what kind of way

00:06:03.442 --> 00:06:08.553
that is to refer to the
magnificent epic achievement

00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:12.873
that is Paradise Lost.
Milton's alluding -- he

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:16.067
hasn't made up this convention
-- he's alluding in these lines

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:18.653
to the opening of Virgil's epic,
The Aeneid,

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:21.613
and also to the beginning
of Spenser's romance epic,

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.043
The Faerie Queene;
Spenser, of course,

00:06:24.043 --> 00:06:27.490
was himself alluding to Virgil.
Virgil and Spenser had begun

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.202
their vast and ambitious
literary project by identifying

00:06:31.202 --> 00:06:36.209
themselves to the readers,
and so each of them in his way

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:41.089
began their huge poems like
this: "I, the poet,

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:45.052
who had sung of happy gardens,
who had been content writing

00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:49.106
pastoral poems -- diminutive,
little pastoral lyrics -- I'm

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:51.576
now embarking on an epic,
and an epic,

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:54.379
as you all know from having
read Homer,

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.350
is a poem that treats of
heroism and of war.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.560
I have graduated to epic
ambition."

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.839
That's how Spenser began The
Faerie Queene and that's how

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.129
Virgil before him had begun
The Aeneid.

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.877
By the time we get to the
Renaissance, this is really the

00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:15.250
standard way of introducing your
epic poem.Okay.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.092
That's fine.
But what sense is there to

00:07:19.092 --> 00:07:24.540
Milton's beginning Paradise
Regained this way?

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.129
[laughs]
He should have done this before

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:30.993
in Paradise Lost.
What sense does it make for

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:35.567
Milton to begin this poem
with that conventional epic

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:39.845
opening?
Milton had already written his

00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:41.586
epic.
Not only had Milton already

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.112
written his epic,
but he had written his

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:45.706
diminutive,
little pastoral lyrics long

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:49.573
before that -- I'd say maybe
thirty years before the

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:52.529
publication of Paradise
Regained.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:55.115
"Lycidas," Comus,
"L'Allegro," and "Il

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:58.240
Penseroso" -- those were
Milton's pastoral poems.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.620
Those were the poems in which
he sang the happy garden,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.163
but to identify Paradise
Lost as a simple pastoral

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.463
about a happy garden is
obviously on some level to get

00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:15.544
it wrong.
I think there's everything

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:22.265
riding on the fact that Milton
has misidentified the nature of

00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:27.009
his Paradise Lost.
This is going to be the

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:30.586
working assumption of the rest
of this lecture:

00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:34.474
that Milton on some level --
and I know this sounds

00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:38.984
far-fetched -- but Milton has
repressed the epic content of

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:43.018
his epic poem.Now,
you'll remember that last time

00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:46.634
we saw how Satan in Paradise
Regained had repressed the

00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:49.079
fact that it was,
in fact, the Son of God who had

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:51.353
brought him to the brink of
destruction during the war in

00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:53.763
heaven.
He had repressed a crucial fact

00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:56.606
about that war,
perhaps the most crucial fact

00:08:56.606 --> 00:09:00.345
about that war.
Well, on some level the speaker

00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:05.163
of the poem, Milton's narrator
-- we can call him Milton --

00:09:05.163 --> 00:09:08.570
joins Satan in this act of
repression,

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.398
and the speaker of this poem
has repressed the fact of the

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.519
war in heaven as well.
It's as if he had forgotten

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:19.097
that Paradise Lost was an
epic, something more than a poem

00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:24.348
merely about a happy garden,
because an epic necessarily

00:09:24.348 --> 00:09:28.779
features the epic subject of
war.

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:32.259
Paradise Lost can't be
identified merely with Book

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:35.179
Four, our introduction to the
Garden of Eden,

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:40.368
needless to say.It's not
just that Paradise Lost

00:09:40.368 --> 00:09:44.377
featured that lush,
extraordinarily beautiful style

00:09:44.377 --> 00:09:47.385
of poetry that Milton feels in
some way he has to resist in

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:50.824
Paradise Regained.
It's not just the lure of

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:54.909
the rich, classical style that
was so tempting there.

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:57.607
It's also the fact that
Paradise Lost

00:09:57.607 --> 00:10:00.097
represented,
gave us an image of,

00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:02.864
heroic actions,
the heroic actions of its

00:10:02.864 --> 00:10:05.520
characters.
Its characters actually did

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.590
something, a fact that we didn't
know we were supposed to

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.990
appreciate so much when we were
actually reading the thing;

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.208
but now that we're reading
Paradise Regained,

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:17.479
the fact that the characters
[laughs]

00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:20.824
actually act and do in
Paradise Lost takes on a

00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:23.633
new meaning.
The very fact of all of that

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:27.160
action that had been represented
in Paradise Lost has

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.865
become something of a problem by
the time we get to Paradise

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:34.584
Regained.Now,
we remember that when Milton in

00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:37.934
those early poems was
considering his problems of

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:42.402
career and of vocation,
he was consistently imagining a

00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:46.679
tension between those two
parables in the Gospel of

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.530
Matthew that posed the question
of action,

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.753
the question of work.
The parable of the talents

00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:59.021
-- this lecture in some
way will be something like a

00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:03.142
review session for the whole
semester up to this point --

00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:07.115
suggested that hard work and
initiative were absolutely

00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:10.279
essential for the Father's
approval,

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:13.321
while the parable of the
workers in the vineyard gave us

00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:16.775
a different understanding.
It suggested in some way that

00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:20.587
the Father approves of the
individual who is willing merely

00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:23.651
to wait to be called to work.
The conflicting,

00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:26.774
or what seemed to be the
conflicting, implications of

00:11:26.774 --> 00:11:30.438
those two parables were worked
over in dozens of earlier poems

00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:34.138
and in prose treatises,
and they're reworked here in

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:38.679
Paradise Regained again,
much later in Milton's career.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:43.177
They're reworked in the three
temptations that the Son of God

00:11:43.177 --> 00:11:46.475
undergoes at the hand of Satan
in Paradise

00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:51.048
Regained.So this for me
is one of the most amazing and

00:11:51.048 --> 00:11:55.396
most surprising aspects of
Satan's temptation of the Son of

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:59.361
God in this poem.
In Paradise Lost,

00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:04.240
Satan had tempted Eve to be
disobedient, and it was clear to

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.500
everyone that this was a kind of
temptation to evil.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.620
But the situation in
Paradise Regained -- this

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.540
is a much more complicated poem.
It's infinitely more complex,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.679
the nature of these
temptations.

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:22.923
Satan in this poem is tempting
the Son not to act disobediently

00:12:22.923 --> 00:12:26.750
but, on some level,
actually to act virtuously or

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.779
to exhibit what strikes us as
virtuous behavior.Now,

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:34.838
the cardinal virtues,
you'll remember from an earlier

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.274
discussion of Comus,
are faith,

00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:42.276
hope, and charity.
In Milton's account -- and it's

00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:45.609
ingenious -- Satan tempts the
Son with those virtues,

00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:48.750
but he does it in precisely the
reverse order.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.860
He tempts the Son to an act of
charity and then to an act of

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.680
hope and then an act of faith.
Now, just think of what Milton

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.789
does to the original story in
Luke.

00:13:00.789 --> 00:13:05.415
Okay: so the Son is hungry
after forty days of fasting in

00:13:05.415 --> 00:13:08.928
the wilderness.
Now in the account from the

00:13:08.928 --> 00:13:12.207
Gospel of Luke,
Satan responds to the Son's

00:13:12.207 --> 00:13:16.580
hunger by tempting him to turn
this stone into bread.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.645
He's tempting him to provide
himself with something to

00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:25.850
eat.Well,
Milton goes way beyond that,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.838
and in Paradise Regained
Satan doesn't merely tempt

00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:31.039
the Son of God to eat something
himself.

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.840
That would be far too easy for
the Son to resist.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.483
He asks the Son to turn the
stone into bread so he can

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.957
perform the virtuous,
the charitable,

00:13:39.957 --> 00:13:43.669
act of feeding the hungry and
of feeding the poor.

00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:48.010
"We are starving here," a
disguised Satan tells the Son,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.271
and, in a magnificent line that
strikes me as perfectly

00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:57.480
prophetic of the vegan movement
of the late twentieth century,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.372
Satan says sublimely,
"We here / live on tough Roots

00:14:04.372 --> 00:14:07.545
and Stubs."
This is the kind of -- I don't

00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:10.235
know if you get those emails
that I get from a woman named

00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:13.019
Anastasia Curley from the Yale
Sustainable Food Project,

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:17.324
but I think of her [laughter]
with those updates from what's

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:20.679
happening at the farm when I
read this line,

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:24.441
"We here live on tough roots
and stubs, and we're asking for

00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:27.021
your help."
That's what Satan says,

00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:30.905
and it's this temptation,
the temptation to virtuous

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:33.799
action, that the Son has to
resist.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:37.346
It's not a simple temptation to
gluttony in any way as it seems

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:41.096
to be in the Gospel original.
Satan is tempting the Son --

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:43.528
what?
-- to exhibit a little

00:14:43.528 --> 00:14:48.185
humanity, to do the right
thing.Milton's father,

00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:51.655
John Milton,
Sr., had pressed the young

00:14:51.655 --> 00:14:57.590
Milton to stop reading at home
and to begin doing something.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.711
His father was pressuring
Milton to perform the virtuous

00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:05.062
action of a clergyman,
and it was just this form of

00:15:05.062 --> 00:15:08.168
virtuous action that Milton,
of course -- and we remember

00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:10.220
this -- was continually
resisting.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.790
He insisted repeatedly that he
wasn't ready yet,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.649
he wasn't ready to start
acting.

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:18.420
"It's too soon," we found him
continually protesting.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.194
"I'm not ripe yet."
He was constantly explaining to

00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:28.751
that paternal authority that he
had in some way internalized the

00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:32.279
fact of his unripeness.Of
course,

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:36.444
it seems to be something just
like the voice of Milton's

00:15:36.444 --> 00:15:41.139
father, which is nothing other
than Milton's own conscience,

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:44.509
that constitutes the essence of
the next temptation.

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:49.051
That's the temptation to accept
the worldly kingdoms from Satan

00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:51.762
as Satan's gift.
It's the second temptation

00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:54.120
which really takes up the bulk
of the poem.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.609
Milton takes this verse from
the Gospel of Luke and explodes

00:15:58.609 --> 00:16:01.730
it into hundreds and hundreds of
lines.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.729
It stretches from the middle of
Book Two to the middle of Book

00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:09.795
Four, and it's here that Milton
really most powerfully distorts

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:13.035
his scriptural source.
He takes what you could think

00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:15.736
of as a kind of brief,
throwaway temptation from the

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:19.607
Gospel of Luke,
and he expands it into a set of

00:16:19.607 --> 00:16:23.680
several sub temptations.
They're genuine temptations,

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.630
and in a lot of ways,
he's imported the notion of

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.132
these temptations from his
favorite canto of The Faerie

00:16:30.132 --> 00:16:32.915
Queene,
 the cave of Mammon canto

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:36.936
from Book Two.So Milton
takes his cue from Spenser and

00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:40.746
transforms this second
temptation into a catalog of all

00:16:40.746 --> 00:16:45.591
of those activities,
all of those seemingly virtuous

00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:50.860
activities, that he had himself
devoted his life to.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.974
This massive and seemingly
endlessly elaborated second

00:16:56.974 --> 00:17:03.549
temptation reads something like
Milton's autobiography.

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:06.699
He explores,
with what I take to be an

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:11.041
almost painful precision,
the central drives and the

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:16.656
impulses of his very being.
Satan tempts the Son of God

00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:19.784
with wealth.
He tempts the Son of God with

00:17:19.784 --> 00:17:22.881
revolutionary political
commitment with the promise of

00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.645
military success.
He offers Jesus the entire

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:28.960
Parthian army to help him regain
the throne of David,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.978
because of course everybody
knows Jesus will eventually

00:17:31.978 --> 00:17:35.960
regain the throne of David.
He tempts the Son with empire.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.756
He offers to give him the
empire of Rome since the current

00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:45.326
emperor, Tiberius,
is so old and corrupt anyway,

00:17:45.326 --> 00:17:51.498
and he tempts him finally with
all of the beauty and all of the

00:17:51.498 --> 00:17:56.575
wisdom and all of the fame
associated with classical

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:01.402
Athens.
In short, Satan tempts the Son

00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:08.789
with just about everything that
was ever important to our John

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:11.878
Milton.
It's almost as if Milton had

00:18:11.878 --> 00:18:15.701
deliberately structured the
second temptation as something

00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:18.720
like a review session for the
Milton exam.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.487
You have an entire career
narrated here.So in the

00:18:22.487 --> 00:18:26.978
temptation to wealth -- and I've
given you a sense of the dates

00:18:26.978 --> 00:18:31.542
but it's also on your handout --
in the temptation to wealth you

00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:35.309
have the protestations of action
and of merit,

00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:39.676
that guilty defensiveness that
you saw in the lyrics of the

00:18:39.676 --> 00:18:43.525
1630s and in that Latin poem,
"Ad Patrem," that Milton had

00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:46.792
written to his father.
In the temptation to political

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.500
commitment or the temptation to
intervene politically,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.453
you have Milton's new
commitment, the commitment of in

00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:56.797
the 1640s -- the decade of his
prose -- to apply his literary

00:18:56.797 --> 00:18:59.640
energies to the goal of the
Puritan Revolution,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.539
the desire to reform the
corruption of church and state.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:08.131
In the temptation to Parthian
military glory,

00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:11.968
you can hear Milton's
conviction in the regicide

00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:15.069
treatises of 1649 and
thereabouts,

00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:20.218
his conviction in the
importance of destroying with

00:19:20.218 --> 00:19:26.163
force, by actual military power,
the unlawful tyranny of Charles

00:19:26.163 --> 00:19:28.890
the First.
In the temptation of the Roman

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.735
empire, you have reflected the
faith that Milton seemed to hold

00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:35.681
in the early 1650s,
at least, in the almost

00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:39.531
unlimited, utopian potential of
the Puritan commonwealth:

00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:43.381
the hope -- and it turned out
to be a crazy and perfectly

00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.713
irrational hope -that an empire
governed by the virtuous Puritan

00:19:47.713 --> 00:19:52.319
saints might actually be able to
precipitate the millennium,

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:56.019
or the apocalypse,
at the end of time.

00:19:56.019 --> 00:20:00.989
In the last part of Satan's
second temptation,

00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:06.620
you have Satan's absolutely
delicious and completely

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:13.466
irresistible offer of literary
fame and classical wisdom in the

00:20:13.466 --> 00:20:19.569
form of classical Athens.
Clearly, this last addition to

00:20:19.569 --> 00:20:24.480
the second temptation -- that is
the thing that persists

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.332
throughout Milton's career.
It obviously spans his entire

00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:33.752
life.So Milton alludes to
and recycles in the elaborated

00:20:33.752 --> 00:20:38.173
second temptation all of the
virtuous commitments and all of

00:20:38.173 --> 00:20:42.743
the disciplined decisions that
he had been making himself over

00:20:42.743 --> 00:20:45.890
the course of the last forty
years.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:50.237
He presents them -- and this is
what's so brilliant -- he

00:20:50.237 --> 00:20:54.430
presents them in a form that the
hero has to resist.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.440
They're temptations that the
hero has to resist.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.156
The voices in his head that had
come to him through the

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:06.348
mechanism of conscience -- or
God or John Milton,

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:09.374
Sr.
or someone authoritative -- all

00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:13.659
of those authoritative voices
are now crystalized in the

00:21:13.659 --> 00:21:17.652
person and the shape of Satan.
Satan is tempting the Son of

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.295
God with a version of
essentially all of the virtuous

00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:22.785
behavior that Milton's father
had pressured Milton

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.631
with.Now,
it's usually clear that the

00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:29.995
Satanic version -- and this is
almost always clear -- that the

00:21:29.995 --> 00:21:33.430
Satanic version of the
temptation is an evil,

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.498
or at least a questionable,
rendition of the virtuous

00:21:36.498 --> 00:21:40.038
action that Milton himself had
over the course of those years

00:21:40.038 --> 00:21:44.120
felt obliged to perform,
but it's not always perfectly

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.316
clear to me as a reader why it
is that all of Satan's arguments

00:21:49.316 --> 00:21:53.078
are faulty,
or why it is we have to dismiss

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:58.196
them necessarily as evil.
It often seems that the Son of

00:21:58.196 --> 00:22:04.482
God is rejecting modes of action
and types of virtuous commitment

00:22:04.482 --> 00:22:10.277
that Milton himself actively
embraced -- which is just a way

00:22:10.277 --> 00:22:15.581
of saying there's nothing that
Milton is not willing to

00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:20.766
question in this poem.
He's struggling to reinterpret,

00:22:20.766 --> 00:22:23.026
in some way,
his entire career,

00:22:23.026 --> 00:22:27.849
as if to purify it of anything
like a self-interested motive.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:32.231
It's as if he's systematically
reviewing and scrutinizing every

00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:36.613
move, every type of action that
he had been engaged in over the

00:22:36.613 --> 00:22:39.520
years,
in order to purify his own past

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.710
by differentiating it in some
way from its Satanic double,

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.950
from a dark version of his own
virtue.Okay.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.700
Let's turn to page 510 in the
Hughes.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.559
This is Book Three,
line 224.

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:02.326
This is a good example of the
way in which Milton will cast as

00:23:02.326 --> 00:23:06.092
a Satanic temptation the voice
of virtuous conscience that had

00:23:06.092 --> 00:23:08.942
plagued him as a younger man.
So Satan asks,

00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:12.484
"If you have such hopes to be
the savior of your nation -- and

00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:15.620
of course you do -- why don't
you hurry up and act?

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.240
Come on.
Do something."

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:24.719
Look at line 224: 
Why move thy feet so slow

00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:27.321
to what is best?
[Now I'll skip a couple of

00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:28.089
lines here.]
â€¦..

00:23:28.089 --> 00:23:32.099
Perhaps thou linger'st in deep
thoughts detain'd

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:34.800
Of the enterprise so hazardous
and high;

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.650
No wonder;
for though in thee be united

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.150
What of perfection can in man
be found,

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.029
Or human nature can receive,
consider

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:48.689
Thy life hath yet been private
[This is quite a jab:

00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:52.984
You're not really fit for
public action at all],

00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:56.930
most part spent
At home, scarce view'd the

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.366
Galilean Towns,
And once a year

00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:04.341
Jerusalemâ€¦
Satan's saying,

00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:06.079
"Oh, I know why you're hesitant
to act.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:09.890
You're too busy lingering in
all of your deep thoughts.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.984
You've spent all of your life
at home and you've never

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:15.884
ventured out.
You've never sallied forth to

00:24:15.884 --> 00:24:20.130
do something in the world."
Milton has incorporated into

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:25.039
Satan's temptation a piercing
critique of his own tendency,

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:29.072
that early tendency,
to wait -- to anticipate rather

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:32.573
than to act.
Satan tempts the Son with the

00:24:32.573 --> 00:24:36.948
wisdom of John Milton,
Sr.: "You've spent most of your

00:24:36.948 --> 00:24:39.920
life in private at home,
reading.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.721
Why in God's name don't you
do something?"Now,

00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:50.210
let's jump ahead to the final
moment of the second temptation,

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.738
which is another of Milton's
additions to the story that has

00:24:54.738 --> 00:24:58.269
absolutely no basis in scripture
whatsoever.

00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:01.563
Of course, its absence from
Milton's biblical source should

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:04.799
only draw our attention all the
more to its importance.

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:09.214
This is the temptation to the
intellectual fame represented by

00:25:09.214 --> 00:25:19.779
classical Athens in Book Four.
Turn to Book Four, line 240.

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:24.594
Satan displays before the Son
all of the cultural wealth of

00:25:24.594 --> 00:25:27.997
ancient Athens,
and at line 240 he invokes

00:25:27.997 --> 00:25:30.802
Athens,
"the eye of Greece,

00:25:30.802 --> 00:25:34.089
Mother of Arts / and
Eloquence."

00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:37.338
This Athens,
the "Mother of Arts," seems to

00:25:37.338 --> 00:25:41.825
possess within it all of the
classical learning that Milton

00:25:41.825 --> 00:25:46.466
himself had been addicted to as
a young man as he spent those

00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:50.875
years after college in studious
retirement at his family's

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:56.597
house.Look down at line 281.
Satan urges the Son to read all

00:25:56.597 --> 00:26:01.675
of these great classical texts.
This is just getting so close

00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:05.065
to home.
Satan says to the Son:

00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:09.771
"These here revolve,
or, as thou lik'st,

00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:12.349
at home."
This is amazing.

00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:15.367
It's as if Satan were imagining
something like a lending

00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:18.440
library, and nothing could be
more tempting to Milton.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.323
The Son could actually think
about, read, and ponder these

00:26:22.323 --> 00:26:24.980
works in the privacy of his own
home.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.629
This line here [laughs]
convinces me that Milton

00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:31.890
himself had an enormous book
collection.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.603
The books were his -- he read
them at home after he was in

00:26:36.603 --> 00:26:40.476
college.
He wasn't merely reading them

00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:46.569
in a nobleman's house or a
friend's copy or in some version

00:26:46.569 --> 00:26:50.815
of a library.
Milton must have read at home,

00:26:50.815 --> 00:26:52.814
until:
These here revolve,

00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:54.339
or, as thou lik'st,
at home,

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:57.190
Till time mature thee to a
Kingdom's weight;

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.910
These rules will render thee a
King complete

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.573
Within thyself,
much more with Empire

00:27:03.573 --> 00:27:07.231
join'd.
This temptation to immerse

00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:11.001
himself in pagan literature at
home, of course,

00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:15.018
is the temptation in
Paradise Regained that

00:27:15.018 --> 00:27:20.099
has to be most difficult for
Milton to imagine resisting.

00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:25.090
Of course, I think it's the
most difficult temptation for us

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.333
as readers to encounter.
It's impossible,

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:31.984
in fact, to read the Son's
response to Satan's temptation

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:35.699
here without wincing,
without wincing at the pain

00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:39.920
that had to have accompanied
Milton's writing of it.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.363
This is the Son who becomes
unbelievably puritanical at this

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:50.991
point in a stereotypical sense
-- this is the top of page 523,

00:27:50.991 --> 00:27:54.970
line 322 of Book Four.
The Son says to Satan: 

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.705
[W]ho reads
Incessantly,

00:27:56.705 --> 00:28:02.012
and to his reading brings not
A spirit and judgment equal or

00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:04.796
superior
(And what he brings,

00:28:04.796 --> 00:28:09.394
what needs he elsewhere seek)
Uncertain and unsettl'd still

00:28:09.394 --> 00:28:12.756
remains,
Deep verst in books and shallow

00:28:12.756 --> 00:28:15.877
in himself,
Crude or intoxicate,

00:28:15.877 --> 00:28:23.647
collecting toys,
And trifles for choice matters,

00:28:23.647 --> 00:28:31.450
worth a sponge [a sponge is an
eraser];

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:36.589
As Children gathering pebbles
on the shore.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:41.675
The Son dismisses literature --
he dismisses all of secular

00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:45.269
learning as mere toys fit for
children.

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:48.787
You can hear something like the
voice of Milton's father here

00:28:48.787 --> 00:28:52.073
accusing Milton of childishness.
You can also see hear the

00:28:52.073 --> 00:28:54.762
important association of
literature with the domestic

00:28:54.762 --> 00:28:57.140
sphere,
the space of the home -- the

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.728
sphere of experience that's
governed not by the child's

00:29:00.728 --> 00:29:03.119
father but by the child's
mother.

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:06.392
It's important,
I think, that Athens is very

00:29:06.392 --> 00:29:10.349
carefully figured by Milton as
the mother of arts,

00:29:10.349 --> 00:29:13.732
because this kind of learning
is presented and represented in

00:29:13.732 --> 00:29:16.099
Milton's poem as a maternal
inheritance.

00:29:16.099 --> 00:29:19.262
It's just this maternal
inheritance that the Son has to

00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:22.599
resist -- because what's his
purpose here in this poem?

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:27.430
It's perfect sole obedience to
the Father.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.791
The Son's rejection of
classical learning really

00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:36.710
parallels Milton's own as he
writes this very poem.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.359
On some level he's describing
for us what he himself is doing.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.420
He's obviously resisting
classical literature,

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.412
or at least allusion to
classical literature,

00:29:46.412 --> 00:29:48.859
throughout Paradise
Regained.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:53.978
This poem is almost -- and
of course, I can only say

00:29:53.978 --> 00:29:59.376
"almost" -- it's almost scoured
of any classical references

00:29:59.376 --> 00:30:04.075
whatsoever.Well,
the exquisitely abstemious Son

00:30:04.075 --> 00:30:08.595
of God resists this most
tempting of temptations just as

00:30:08.595 --> 00:30:14.264
he has resisted all the others.
This is the big gun that Satan

00:30:14.264 --> 00:30:18.766
has just pulled out,
and Satan understandably is

00:30:18.766 --> 00:30:24.306
beside himself with frustration.
Look at line 366,

00:30:24.306 --> 00:30:29.708
top of page 524:
Satan is "quite at a loss,

00:30:29.708 --> 00:30:34.210
for all his darts were
spent..."

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:41.699
Satan has nothing else to ask
but this astonishing question at

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:46.575
line 372.
Look at Satan's question at

00:30:46.575 --> 00:30:52.059
line 372: "What dost thou in
this World?"

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:54.409
In other words,
"You have rejected every form

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:57.665
of action, and I can't imagine
that you're actually willing to

00:30:57.665 --> 00:30:59.300
do anything.
This is ridiculous.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.055
Can you do anything but say no?"
Satan asks the Son.What,

00:31:03.055 --> 00:31:06.425
of course, Satan doesn't
understand yet is that this poem

00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:09.045
isn't about action.
It's not about doing,

00:31:09.045 --> 00:31:12.130
but on some important level
it's about knowledge.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.556
Particularly,
it's about self-knowledge and

00:31:15.556 --> 00:31:20.534
it's the problem of knowledge
that really comes to the fore at

00:31:20.534 --> 00:31:24.983
the third and final temptation,
which goes like this:

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:26.880
"If you are,
as you claim,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.840
the real Son of God,
then prove it,"

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.407
Satan challenges the Son.
So the third temptation is

00:31:34.407 --> 00:31:39.644
essentially a paternity test.
It's a test in his faith in who

00:31:39.644 --> 00:31:42.685
his father is.
Satan's coming to the point

00:31:42.685 --> 00:31:46.940
where he has to learn once and
for all exactly who this Son is,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.671
and it's here that Satan takes
the Son to the top of the

00:31:49.671 --> 00:31:54.645
pinnacle -- the Father's house,
the top of the temple -- to

00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:59.710
prove that he is,
in fact, a Son of God.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.593
Satan is going back,
he's returning once again to

00:32:02.593 --> 00:32:06.017
that proclamation that the
Father had made at the baptism,

00:32:06.017 --> 00:32:11.582
"This is my beloved Son."
He has to figure out once and

00:32:11.582 --> 00:32:18.039
for all what that meant.So
look at page 527.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:22.890
This is Book Four,
line 515, Satan to the Son:

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:27.506
[I want to] learn
In what degree or meaning thou

00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:29.772
art call'd
The Son of God,

00:32:29.772 --> 00:32:36.549
which bears no single sense;
The Son of God I also am,

00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:42.240
or was,
And, if I was, I am;

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:53.327
relation standsâ€¦
The relation of past and

00:32:53.327 --> 00:32:57.003
present, the relation of who I
was to who I am,

00:32:57.003 --> 00:33:00.200
is finally presented here
explicitly.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.538
This is the big question,
and it's here that the extent

00:33:04.538 --> 00:33:09.038
of what we can think of Satan's
repression becomes almost

00:33:09.038 --> 00:33:13.816
unbearable for me to witness.
Satan insists that the Son of

00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:18.363
God is a term that can be used
indiscriminately to describe all

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:22.470
of God's human and angelic
creatures, and he's right.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.996
It was used pretty much
indiscriminately throughout a

00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:31.748
lot of Paradise Lost.
Satan is incapable here of

00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:36.559
acknowledging to himself the
identity of this Son of God,

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:39.807
this opponent,
with that Son of God -- the Son

00:33:39.807 --> 00:33:42.549
of God, the so-called only
begotten,

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:45.242
the first begotten,
in heaven way back when:

00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:49.000
that Son of God whose favor in
the eyes of the Father had,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.186
of course, motivated Satan's
fall from heaven in the first

00:33:52.186 --> 00:33:55.373
place and had motivated the
rebellion.Satan brings the

00:33:55.373 --> 00:33:58.895
Son to the top of the temple and
he asks the Son to cast himself

00:33:58.895 --> 00:34:01.835
down.
It's incredible the degree to

00:34:01.835 --> 00:34:06.806
which this climactic moment in
this poem reworks that climactic

00:34:06.806 --> 00:34:11.938
moment in the other poem -- from
the war in heaven in Paradise

00:34:11.938 --> 00:34:15.814
Lost.
It's as if unconsciously,

00:34:15.814 --> 00:34:22.070
Satan is trying to re-stage
that fall from heaven perhaps,

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.065
in some sort of fantasy way,
to have it have a different

00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:29.770
outcome -- that terrible moment
at which the Son had

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.128
successfully maneuvered Satan
and the other rebel angels into

00:34:34.128 --> 00:34:37.179
casting themselves down from
heaven.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:42.900
It's as if this were a
desperate attempt to redo a

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.570
traumatic moment in the familial
past.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.419
Satan tempts the Son to call
upon the Father to lift him up,

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:54.877
since it is written in
scripture that angels will rush

00:34:54.877 --> 00:34:59.156
to the aid of the Son of God.
In essence, if you are in fact

00:34:59.156 --> 00:35:01.000
the Son of God,
prove it!

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.089
Call upon the Father to help
you.It's at this point in

00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:09.035
Milton's text that absolutely
everything that we've been

00:35:09.035 --> 00:35:12.920
discussing comes to a head.
It's a remarkable convergence.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:23.599
Look at line 560 on page 528:
"To whom thus Jesus.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:28.750
Also it is written,
/ Tempt not the Lord thy God;

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:33.484
he said, and stood.
/ But Satan,

00:35:33.484 --> 00:35:39.539
smitten with amazement
fellâ€¦"

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:43.360
The Son of God performs no
action here other than quoting a

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.389
verse, a verse from the Book of
Deuteronomy,

00:35:46.389 --> 00:35:49.957
and then stands,
or maybe actually just remains

00:35:49.957 --> 00:35:52.739
standing.
He refuses to honor Satan's

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:56.956
request, and he exhibits his
complete and total obedience to

00:35:56.956 --> 00:36:00.030
the Father by quoting the
Father's word,

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.986
by quoting scripture:
"Tempt not the Lord thy

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:06.548
God."It's at this point,
and it is not before this

00:36:06.548 --> 00:36:10.022
point,
that the truth of the Son's

00:36:10.022 --> 00:36:14.590
identity becomes evident to
Satan, I think.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.216
I think this is also the moment
at which the truth of the Son's

00:36:19.216 --> 00:36:22.500
identity becomes apparent also
to the Son.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:29.247
On one level Jesus merely
means, don't tempt the Lord thy

00:36:29.247 --> 00:36:31.268
God;
don't tempt the Lord to help

00:36:31.268 --> 00:36:34.145
you if you don't really need his
help, if you can do it on your

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:36.430
own.
But at the very moment that the

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.909
Son quotes the Father's
scripture, it's almost as if the

00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:44.019
meaning of this scriptural verse
changes before our very eyes.

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:48.721
"Tempt not the Lord thy God"
comes also to mean -- maybe by

00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:53.909
the time he's gotten to the God
part -- it comes also to mean,

00:36:53.909 --> 00:36:58.926
perhaps, "Don't tempt me
because I am in some way the

00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:02.599
Lord thy God."
At this very moment of absolute

00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:06.653
obedience, the Son is rewarded
with the knowledge that he is

00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:10.225
not only the Savior or the
Messiah -- he's known that

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:13.605
â€“
but he's rewarded with the

00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:19.206
knowledge that in some sense he
is God himself.It's an

00:37:19.206 --> 00:37:24.086
incredible moment,
and it's at this moment that

00:37:24.086 --> 00:37:29.619
it's as if this poem's
repression of Paradise Lost,

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:32.019
the earlier poem,
has been lifted.

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:35.466
The repression that has
obscured the identity of this

00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:39.474
Son of God with that Son of God,
the Son of God who was actually

00:37:39.474 --> 00:37:42.699
responsible for driving out
Satan from heaven in the first

00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:44.849
place -- the repression
evaporates.

00:37:44.849 --> 00:37:48.967
As soon as the reality of the
situation asserts itself once

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:52.304
again, it's amazing:
Satan falls headlong to his

00:37:52.304 --> 00:37:55.586
destruction.
It's as if all of these pieces

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:58.663
of the puzzle are suddenly
fitting together,

00:37:58.663 --> 00:38:02.885
and finally the identity of
this Son of God with that Son of

00:38:02.885 --> 00:38:06.320
God in Paradise Lost is
established.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.682
It seems to me that everybody
in the poem is surprised,

00:38:10.682 --> 00:38:14.479
even the heavenly
angels.Look at line 605 of

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:17.096
Book Four.
This is where the angels are

00:38:17.096 --> 00:38:21.854
singing in praise of the Son.
I'm convinced that it's only

00:38:21.854 --> 00:38:28.862
now that they realize who this
guy is, which means who this guy

00:38:28.862 --> 00:38:33.181
had been.
So the angels tell the Son in

00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:36.776
this heavenly hymn,
and they're speaking of Satan

00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:39.239
here:
[H]im long of old

00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:43.636
Thou didst debel [debel means
to conquer in war],

00:38:43.636 --> 00:38:47.820
and down from Heav'n cast
With all his Army;

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.605
now thou hast aveng'd
Supplanted Adam,

00:38:50.605 --> 00:38:55.018
and by vanquishing
Temptation, hast regain'd lost

00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:59.966
Paradiseâ€¦
This is the first moment that

00:38:59.966 --> 00:39:05.580
this poem has acknowledged the
Son's agency in the war that was

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.833
represented in the earlier poem.
Finally, the connection between

00:39:10.833 --> 00:39:14.261
Paradise Lost and
Paradise Regained is

00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:17.958
established.Look at that
last line that I just read,

00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:20.562
line 608.
You have something like the

00:39:20.562 --> 00:39:23.949
visual indication of the
conjunction of the two poems.

00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:27.389
Their titles are compressed
into three words.

00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:32.369
Both titles are compressed into
three words: "regain'd lost

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.145
Paradise."
I think it's one of the

00:39:35.145 --> 00:39:38.940
greatest, most exciting
revelation scenes in all of

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.001
Western literature.
The entire phenomenon of

00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:44.320
recovered memory -- the
recovered memory,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.080
for example,
of years later of past

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.235
traumatic abuse -- is obviously
one that only really began to

00:39:52.235 --> 00:39:56.360
assert itself later in the
twentieth century,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.912
or in the early '90s with Oprah
and Roseanne,

00:39:58.912 --> 00:40:02.161
although you probably don't
remember Roseanne's recovered

00:40:02.161 --> 00:40:04.730
memory.
But Milton was representing

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.162
just this phenomenon,
the phenomenon of recovered

00:40:08.162 --> 00:40:11.236
memory, in 1671,
and he represented it on an

00:40:11.236 --> 00:40:15.186
unbelievably huge scale.
It's not just the revelation of

00:40:15.186 --> 00:40:19.139
a character's identity.
It's the identity of an entire

00:40:19.139 --> 00:40:20.760
text.
What is that text?

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.853
The text is only the greatest
poem ever written in English

00:40:24.853 --> 00:40:27.869
that is brought to light at this
moment.

00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:32.696
The Son by resisting the
Satan's temptation has regained

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:37.347
lost paradise but Milton has
regained Paradise Lost

00:40:37.347 --> 00:40:40.769
and allowed us to regain
Paradise

00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:45.771
Lost.Remember at the
beginning that it seemed that

00:40:45.771 --> 00:40:50.861
Milton had actually forgotten
the epic content of his poem:

00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:53.438
"Oh,
I was just writing some

00:40:53.438 --> 00:40:56.723
pastoral and I called it
Paradise Lost, but

00:40:56.723 --> 00:41:00.938
now -- eureka!
" It's like an enormous bolt of

00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:04.780
lightning hits him and he
remembers.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.505
He remembers that Paradise
Lost was,

00:41:07.505 --> 00:41:11.399
in fact, an epic and according
to Milton it's this revelation

00:41:11.399 --> 00:41:14.579
which is the moment at which man
is redeemed.

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:18.230
This is the moment at which
paradise is regained,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.945
and the Son proves his identity
through the simple quotation of

00:41:22.945 --> 00:41:25.760
scripture -- nothing
imaginative,

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.161
nothing fancy.
He's quoting the Bible:

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:32.610
"Tempt not the Lord thy God."
Milton proves his own obedience

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:37.511
to God by his composition of a
biblical epic that is virtually

00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:42.252
untainted by the ornaments of
classical literature.So it

00:41:42.252 --> 00:41:46.510
is at this moment [laughs]
of proof that everything in

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.929
Paradise Regained is
permitted to change.

00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:53.393
As soon as Milton describes
Satan's fall,

00:41:53.393 --> 00:41:57.150
he allows himself to embrace --
and we're so happy for this --

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:00.783
to embrace a poetic mode that
had been completely suppressed

00:42:00.783 --> 00:42:04.545
up to this point,
and this is the sublime mode of

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:07.425
epic grandeur.
All of a sudden we have not one

00:42:07.425 --> 00:42:10.748
epic simile, but we have two,
and it's as if we're breathing

00:42:10.748 --> 00:42:14.199
oxygen again.
Milton compares the Son's

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:19.400
victory over Satan to Hercules'
defeat of Antaeus,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.627
Antaeus being the figure who
gained his strength from his

00:42:22.627 --> 00:42:25.923
mother, the earth,
every time he touched the

00:42:25.923 --> 00:42:27.929
ground.
Milton, of course,

00:42:27.929 --> 00:42:32.400
is also figuring the victory of
Christianity over the maternal

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.250
arts of Greece.Finally,
at line 572,

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:42.300
Milton compares Satan to the
Theban sphinx.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.118
Look at line 572: 
And as that Theban

00:42:46.118 --> 00:42:51.125
monster that propos'dHer
riddle, and him who solv'd it

00:42:51.125 --> 00:42:54.015
not,
devour'd,That once found

00:42:54.015 --> 00:42:57.428
out and solv'd,
for grief and spiteCast

00:42:57.428 --> 00:43:02.059
herself headlong from th'
Ismenian steepâ€¦

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:06.182
Now, Milton doesn't mention
here who it was who found out

00:43:06.182 --> 00:43:08.980
and solved the riddle of the
sphinx.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.143
He doesn't mention who it was
who impelled the sphinx to cast

00:43:12.143 --> 00:43:14.409
herself headlong from the
Ismenian steep.

00:43:14.409 --> 00:43:19.232
Like Satan who has repressed up
to this point the name of who it

00:43:19.232 --> 00:43:23.289
was who had caused him to hurl
himself from heaven,

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:27.069
Milton -- in a kind of
interesting and really related

00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:31.285
way -- Milton is repressing the
name of that classical hero

00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:34.110
here;
but of course we know.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:38.078
We know who solved the riddle
of the sphinx and we know that

00:43:38.078 --> 00:43:41.441
the Son of God is implicitly
being compared to him:

00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:44.758
it was Oedipus.
It was Oedipus who was able to

00:43:44.758 --> 00:43:48.970
answer the riddle posed by the
sphinx, and it was Oedipus whose

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.638
answer pressed the sphinx to
cast herself off that high

00:43:52.638 --> 00:43:55.900
precipice.What was the
sphinx's riddle?

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.115
Some of you will remember.
The riddle was,

00:43:58.115 --> 00:44:01.875
what creature goes first on
four legs, then on two legs,

00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:06.796
and then finally on three legs?
And Oedipus' ingenious answer

00:44:06.796 --> 00:44:11.630
was "man": because man is born
to crawl on all fours,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.475
initially, then grows up to
walk on two legs,

00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:17.450
and ends his life as an old man
with a cane,

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:21.430
or what amounts to three legs.
Before this simile,

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.343
Satan had asked the Son a
riddle, essentially,

00:44:24.343 --> 00:44:26.610
and the riddle was:
who are you?

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.232
The Son's answer to that riddle
was -- it was kind of,

00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:34.216
"I am the Lord thy God."
Oedipus' answer to the riddle

00:44:34.216 --> 00:44:38.400
of the sphinx was "man," and
it's been one conjecture,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.753
and I think it's a very strong
one, that the truth of the Son's

00:44:41.753 --> 00:44:44.349
identity in Paradise Regained
involves,

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:46.788
in some way,
a combination of those two

00:44:46.788 --> 00:44:49.386
answers.
The Son of God is both God and

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:53.300
man, and you could see Milton
using these classical illusions

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.822
in some way to encode the
mysterious truth of the Son's

00:44:56.822 --> 00:44:59.431
identity and to encode the
mystery of the

00:44:59.431 --> 00:45:03.645
incarnation.Now there is,
of course, much more to the

00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:07.789
story of Oedipus than Milton is
alluding to in this simile.

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:12.023
Oedipus is most famous for
having killed his father and

00:45:12.023 --> 00:45:16.266
then having married his mother.
Since Paradise Regained

00:45:16.266 --> 00:45:20.090
is a poem that is everywhere
concerned with repression,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.762
with all of those things that
it refuses to acknowledge,

00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:27.568
it's surely not too far-fetched
to imagine the relation of

00:45:27.568 --> 00:45:31.374
Milton's poem to that most
obvious aspect of the classical

00:45:31.374 --> 00:45:34.585
story of Oedipus.
This is, after all,

00:45:34.585 --> 00:45:39.875
the classical myth that became
for Freud the dominant myth of

00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:43.606
repression.
Milton, by the way -- this is a

00:45:43.606 --> 00:45:48.278
conjecture from a brilliant
Freudian reading of Milton by a

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:52.869
critic named William Kerrigan --
Milton was one of Freud's

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:56.025
favorite poets,
and it's been argued that

00:45:56.025 --> 00:45:59.115
Milton in a lot of ways in
Paradise Lost and

00:45:59.115 --> 00:46:02.267
Paradise Regained
provides Freud with some of

00:46:02.267 --> 00:46:05.914
the intellectual tools by which
he developed the complicated

00:46:05.914 --> 00:46:09.190
notion of the Oedipus
complex.In any case,

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:13.340
I think you have in Paradise
Regained as powerful a

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.855
representation of repression as
anything that you could find in

00:46:17.855 --> 00:46:21.027
the pages of Freud.
So in Sophocles' famous

00:46:21.027 --> 00:46:24.413
tragedy, Oedipus Rex,
Oedipus kills his father

00:46:24.413 --> 00:46:28.449
and moves in with his mother,
Jocasta, the Queen of Thebes.

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:31.274
I don't want to suggest -- this
is what I'm willing to repress

00:46:31.274 --> 00:46:34.052
here -- that Milton's interested
in the sexual element of the

00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:37.072
Son's relation to his mother,
although of course we know that

00:46:37.072 --> 00:46:39.769
Milton does have an interest in
incest: think of Satan,

00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:43.380
Sin, and Death in Paradise
Lost.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.286
But Milton's very much
interested, I think,

00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:49.400
in the fact that Oedipus killed
his father.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.461
There's a very real sense in
which the Son's defeat of Satan

00:46:53.461 --> 00:46:57.386
in Paradise Regained is a
literary rewriting of the

00:46:57.386 --> 00:46:59.722
hostility,
the simmering resentment,

00:46:59.722 --> 00:47:00.820
of John Milton,
Jr.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.429
to John Milton, Sr.
Above all things,

00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:07.699
the Son resents the temptation
to act in a way that the public

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:11.417
world values as important.
Milton's laying to rest once

00:47:11.417 --> 00:47:15.034
and for all -- his father is
already dead -- but once and for

00:47:15.034 --> 00:47:18.654
all the censorious,
judgmental voice of his

00:47:18.654 --> 00:47:24.641
father.We might even be able
to say that he has hereby in

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:29.530
some figurative way killed his
earthly father.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.093
His patricide is closely
related to what is happening at

00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:37.175
the actual narrative of the poem
when the Son of God realizes at

00:47:37.175 --> 00:47:40.610
that extraordinary moment that
he himself is God.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:44.503
The Son of God identifies with
God, with the Father,

00:47:44.503 --> 00:47:48.015
and by means of that
identification in some way

00:47:48.015 --> 00:47:52.672
displaces or renders unnecessary
-- we could say even kills --

00:47:52.672 --> 00:47:55.508
the father.
When the Son internalizes the

00:47:55.508 --> 00:47:58.532
authority of the Father and
actually becomes on some level

00:47:58.532 --> 00:48:01.587
the Father himself,
it's as if the Father as a

00:48:01.587 --> 00:48:04.999
meaningful, external reality
were dead.Well,

00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:08.846
critics have always been
puzzled and astounded by this

00:48:08.846 --> 00:48:11.750
ending of Paradise
Regained.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:16.688
After the moment of the Son's
victory over Satan on the

00:48:16.688 --> 00:48:21.170
pinnacle, the entire poem seems
to shift gears.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.965
All of a sudden,
this is the Milton we recognize

00:48:23.965 --> 00:48:26.554
and love.
All of a sudden the quality of

00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:29.393
the verse begins to revert back
to that rich,

00:48:29.393 --> 00:48:32.360
densely textured style of
Paradise Lost.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.085
The Son himself,
on the level of plot,

00:48:35.085 --> 00:48:39.008
is rewarded for his victory
with the beautiful assistance of

00:48:39.008 --> 00:48:42.199
angels who come to feed him and
Milton, too.

00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:45.650
On the poetic level,
as a poet, Milton is rewarded.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.902
He's successfully resisted the
poetic lushness of Paradise

00:48:48.902 --> 00:48:52.489
Lost up to this point,
and he's permitted for his

00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:56.630
pains to return to that lush and
extravagant style.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.727
He's acutely aware of the new
direction, I think,

00:49:00.727 --> 00:49:06.020
that the poem is taking at this
point.Look at the last line

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:10.801
of the poem: "hee unobserv'd /
Home to his Mother's house

00:49:10.801 --> 00:49:15.763
private return'd."
The Son is rewarded for his

00:49:15.763 --> 00:49:20.080
efforts in good,
Oedipal fashion with the

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.659
mother.
The Son has proven himself

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:25.197
victorious in the Father's
house, the temple,

00:49:25.197 --> 00:49:28.428
and it's only after that
victory that he can reassume the

00:49:28.428 --> 00:49:30.620
pleasures of the domestic
sphere,

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:35.117
the space of the mother.
I think that Milton's ending is

00:49:35.117 --> 00:49:38.274
also Milton's best description
of what it is that actually

00:49:38.274 --> 00:49:41.266
happens in the remarkable
conclusion to this remarkable

00:49:41.266 --> 00:49:44.482
poem.
He has renounced so much in his

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:47.659
composition of Paradise
Regained.

00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:50.989
He has forsaken his love of
wandering verse.

00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:54.736
He's forsaken all of that
learned allusiveness for a

00:49:54.736 --> 00:49:56.940
highly disciplined,
austere,

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.104
and severely repressive style
and, just as the Son in the poem

00:50:01.104 --> 00:50:05.269
is rewarded for his obedience to
the Father with the return to

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:09.960
his mother's house,
Milton is rewarded for his own

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:15.681
literary submission to the
austere style of the Father's

00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:20.405
gospel.It's almost as if,
retrospectively,

00:50:20.405 --> 00:50:25.815
Milton can now be said to have
earned the right to have written

00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:29.469
Paradise Lost.
He can identify himself now

00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:33.289
as someone who was entitled to
have written Paradise Lost.

00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:35.589
Milton was rewarded at the
end of the poem with the

00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:37.079
triumphant return to the
imagery,

00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:41.344
the wisdom, and the beauty of
his beloved classics,

00:50:41.344 --> 00:50:46.548
and he justifies to himself and
to his reader how it is he can

00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:51.325
be a dutiful Christian poet who
can also at the same time

00:50:51.325 --> 00:50:55.590
indulge at will in the great
pagan classics.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.847
He's proven himself to the
heavenly father and he can now

00:50:58.847 --> 00:51:02.395
-- it's as if he can read and
write as freely as anything that

00:51:02.395 --> 00:51:06.059
he was able to imagine way back
in 1644 in Areopagitica.

00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:08.604
The ending,
the last line of this poem,

00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:11.210
is so incredibly beautiful --
this quiet,

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:15.510
exquisite ending -- and when we
read that the Son of God returns

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.775
home to his mother's house,
we have an image,

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:22.860
I think, of a similar return on
the part of the poet.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:29.818
Milton is returning -- almost
but not entirely unobserved --

00:51:29.818 --> 00:51:35.007
to the paradise of Greece,
mother of arts and

00:51:35.007 --> 00:51:41.060
eloquence.Okay.
We are in for the home stretch.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:49.150
We have four more things to do.
Friday we will all be meeting

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:54.489
in LC 102 -- is that right?
Yes, in LC 102.

00:51:54.489 --> 00:52:00.765
Instead of sections,
we will be meeting as a group

00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:07.937
-- this is the size of the
section actually -- as a group

00:52:07.937 --> 00:52:11.343
in LC 102.
You have to begin to prepare

00:52:11.343 --> 00:52:14.340
yourselves for the final poem,
Samson Agonistes.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.699
Make sure that you all have
read it all.

00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:19.588
It's not very long,
but it's pretty friggin'

00:52:19.588 --> 00:52:24.160
intense.
Read it all by Monday's class.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.160
Okay.

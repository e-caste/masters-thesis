00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.141
Professor Amy
Hungerford: It is the

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:06.135
seventh week of term,
and in this class,

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:08.589
if you have kept up,
you have read nine novels in

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.640
seven weeks.
So, if you kept up,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.470
I want you, right now,
to pat yourself on the back.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.480
Oh, I don't see a lot of
patting.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.930
Okay: if you just missed one
novel.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.511
Okay.
I don't want to look.

00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:34.383
Do your patting later.
Let me say that you have broken

00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:38.618
the back of the course,
not to use too violent a

00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:41.580
metaphor.
It's the seventh week.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.371
We have six weeks left.
In those six weeks we have

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:51.310
five--count them--five novels.
That's it, and one of them you

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.621
get to choose.
So, instead of doing two novels

00:00:55.621 --> 00:01:00.050
in a week, you'll have a week
and a half for one novel.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.130
This is a much more humane pace.
Why are you laughing?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.449
It's not funny.
You also, of course,

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:15.163
have Spring Break.
If you use Spring Break wisely,

00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:19.900
read, in a somewhat leisurely
way, in Myrtle Beach,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.434
as you're relaxing on the
beach, Blood

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:29.090
Meridian--excellent beach
novel--you'll be in great shape.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.734
You'll be riding high through
the rest of the term,

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:37.556
easy-peasy, okay.
Why did I do that to you these

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.950
last three weeks?
Why did I do that?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.065
Well, one reason,
as I said at the beginning of

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:48.264
class, at the beginning of the
term, is that I did not want you

00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:50.769
to be crushed after Spring
Break.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:55.280
I wanted you to be crushed now,
so it'll be better later.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.298
But there's another reason.
So, why didn't I just drop

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:03.286
one of those novels?
Well, my lecture today is,

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:06.710
in part, an answer to that
question.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:16.888
A syllabus is not a parade.
It's not a succession of novels

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:19.656
that passes by,
and we wave,

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:25.500
and we catch whatever candy or
beads they throw at us,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.377
and then we go home at the end
of the day with sore feet from

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:33.509
standing too long.
It's not like that.

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:38.165
A syllabus, at least in this
kind of class and with me

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:44.191
teaching it, is an argument.
It's an argument about a whole

00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:49.528
historical period.
It's an argument about a chunk

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:55.273
of literary-historical history.
It's an argument about the

00:02:55.273 --> 00:03:00.409
evolution of an art form in a
particular place and time.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.140
In order to preserve that
quality of a syllabus,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.326
you have to read quite a bit.
Reading quite a bit means that

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:19.571
you can begin to see the
lineaments of larger trends and

00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:24.000
movements in that historical
period.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.526
It allows you to amass enough
evidence to build an

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:32.060
intellectual understanding of
what's going on in this period.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.380
If I had dropped a novel,
there are certain kinds of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.440
arguments I would not have been
able to make,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.305
and the argument that I'm going
to make for you today would not

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:48.090
be as compelling as I hope it
will be.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.091
So, as in the Franny and
Zooey lecture,

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:57.154
I tried to demonstrate for you
in a very self-conscious way how

00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:02.053
literary scholars make local
arguments that take into account

00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:05.835
an entire novel,
its major features,

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:12.208
and use the evidence of detail
at the level of text to support

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:17.127
those kinds of claims.
Today I'm going to make a much

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:21.743
broader argument of the kind
that literary scholars are often

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:26.547
interested in making.
I'm going to make an argument

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:32.258
about a major trend in this
period, and to do that I will

00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:36.198
use evidence,
and I'm going to call on you to

00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:40.368
help me put together the
evidence for broader claims that

00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:41.560
cross novels.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.400
An argument of this kind has a
different quality from those

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.791
more local arguments about
individual novels that I've made

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.094
each week.
It's different in the sense

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:59.144
that I want, and most literary
scholars want,

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:04.206
such arguments not to be
totally counterintuitive in the

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:09.912
way that you can sometimes take
pleasure in making a reading of

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:15.416
a local novel counterintuitive.
For the big arguments,

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:20.797
you want to be able to account
for what is obvious about the

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:24.500
period,
but perhaps has not been

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.149
justified as an analysis of the
period.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:31.921
So, you want a sense of
inevitability,

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:35.891
that this argument you're
making explains all kinds of

00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:40.459
things that people have always
noticed about that period.

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.814
In the same way that,
when I lectured on Franny

00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:47.854
and Zooey, I asked you what
was obvious to you about the

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:52.030
novel and then my argument went
around and spoke back to those

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.112
things at different points.
So this general argument aims

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:59.253
to speak to those obvious parts,
but it speaks more

00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:02.269
strongly to those obvious
perceptions,

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:07.399
and so I'm launching into a
different kind of argument.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:11.686
What I want to talk to you
about today is a particular

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:16.273
narrative form and convention,
and I'm calling it the Identity

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.843
Plot.
Certainly, I am not the first

00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:22.827
scholar to think about identity
as a form of narrative in this

00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:25.806
period,
and it's precisely because I am

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:29.709
not the first that I can give it
this sort of name.

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:34.240
There is so much work that's
been done excavating how

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.467
identity works in the novel in
this period that it has become

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:45.045
something we know a lot about.
What hasn't been said before is

00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:49.432
that it has this particular
name, and I use this name

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:52.573
because,
for me, the Identity Plot,

00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:57.682
which I will explain in a few
moments, fulfills much the same

00:06:57.682 --> 00:07:02.620
function in fiction of this
period as the Marriage Plot did

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.109
for the Victorian novel.
So, any of you who have taken

00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:10.939
the Victorian novel class,
Professor Yeazell's course,

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:16.189
or have studied or just read a
lot of Jane Austen novels,

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:22.106
Dickens novels and so on,
you will know what the Marriage

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:25.319
Plot is.
The Marriage Plot is that

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:30.580
engine of storytelling that
makes novels hang on a structure

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.019
of a couple and the question of
whether they will get together

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:39.163
or not.
Now, there are all kinds of

00:07:39.163 --> 00:07:43.001
stages in that development,
the development of that

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:46.380
narrative.
Are the couples from the same

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.901
social class?
Are they from geographically

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.190
contiguous places?

00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.640
Do they have personalities that
match?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.163
Do their parents agree?
Are they related to each other

00:08:03.163 --> 00:08:07.836
secretly (always a problem)?
There are all kinds of things

00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:10.769
that can go wrong for a couple
trying to get together,

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:14.639
and the Victorian novel was
very good at generating

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.509
narrative from all those kinds
of complications.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:22.781
Then, there are different kinds
of outcomes that you can have in

00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:25.630
the novel governed by the
Marriage Plot.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.428
One is the comedy.
That's when you get married at

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:34.090
the end, the couple gets
married.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.493
Then there's the tragedy:
They don't, and they should

00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:42.057
have, and we all know it.
So, Pride and Prejudice

00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:44.220
would be an example of the
former kind;

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.817
Anna Karenina perhaps an
example of the latter kind,

00:08:47.817 --> 00:08:50.980
even though that's a novel
really about adultery.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.628
It totally depends on the
conventions of the Marriage

00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:57.341
Plot.
The Identity Plot works in much

00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:00.779
the same way.So,
what is the Identity Plot?

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:04.989
I am going to give you an
unusual sight in my class now,

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.980
and that is Power Point.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.123
I think I'm sort of surprised
and delighted by this myself,

00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:19.153
so we'll see how it works.
So, if you're taking notes,

00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:23.004
which I encourage you to do,
you will find there are bolded

00:09:23.004 --> 00:09:26.386
words that you can copy down.
The Identity Plot:

00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:28.970
Narrative Form in Post-1945
Fiction.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.480
Isn't that snazzy?
Okay.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.243
(Oops.
I've already made my first

00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:35.848
technological mistake.
There we go.) Six elements of

00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:39.674
the Identity Plot.
Make sure you capitalize

00:09:39.674 --> 00:09:44.936
"Identity" and "Plot," please,
and also give me credit in the

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:48.620
footnote of your notes for that
phrase.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.869
The narrative of the Identity
Plot novel revolves around the

00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:58.584
question of how to define and
understand a character's

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:03.017
identity (big surprise there).
And, number 2:

00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:08.850
the character needs to be a
member of the minority within a

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.660
larger society.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.569
I am not going to ask you to
volunteer examples of these,

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:25.198
because it's just too obvious
that our last three or four

00:10:25.198 --> 00:10:29.580
novels each feature one of these
characteristics,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.050
or all of them.

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:39.043
The third one is absolutely
crucial to the development of

00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:44.043
the Identity Plot,
and that is that the character

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:49.386
is also at odds with the
minority group of which he or

00:10:49.386 --> 00:10:53.352
she is a part.
This is important,

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:59.358
because without it,
the Identity Plot gets really

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:02.845
boring.
It doesn't have a lot of

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:06.969
complication.
If all you have to do is

00:11:06.969 --> 00:11:12.373
realize, as you're going about
your life, "wow,

00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:19.080
I am a member of X or Y group.
Great.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.919
I know who I am now.
Done."

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:28.269
that is a really short story,
actually, and it's not a good

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:31.467
short story, either.
There is just not enough

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:35.805
resistance to the evolution of
the plot, so it's really

00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:38.726
important.
The drama of the Identity

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:40.280
Plot depends upon this.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.435
Furthermore,
the character in question needs

00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:54.018
to be conflicted about his or
her difference from the majority

00:11:54.018 --> 00:11:59.051
and about his or her
difference from the minority

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.280
group.
Can anyone think of an example

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:01.620
of this?

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.339
Can anyone think of an example?
Yes, Eli.Student:

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:22.736
Woman
Warrior.Professor Amy

00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:27.970
Hungerford: Absolutely,
yeah.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.472
So in case you didn't hear Eli,
Woman Warrior is a great

00:12:32.472 --> 00:12:35.814
example of this.
Maxine (that's what I'll call

00:12:35.814 --> 00:12:39.883
her when I'm talking about the
character Maxine Hong

00:12:39.883 --> 00:12:44.302
Kingston) Maxine feels alienated
from Chinese culture because of

00:12:44.302 --> 00:12:47.669
the misogyny she perceives in
that culture,

00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:52.365
but she also turns to Chinese
culture as a way to identify

00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:56.320
herself and to give her a
positive self-image,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.547
as in that story of the woman
warrior (which I actually didn't

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:02.138
ask you to read,
but there are other examples in

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:05.416
the stories that I did ask you
to read, chapters that I did ask

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:09.210
you to read,
to give her that sense of

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.540
grounding as a person).
Other examples.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.399
How about in The Bluest Eye?
Yes.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:24.479
Student:
Franny and

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:33.049
Zooey.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:35.660
I think Franny and Zooey
really does fit this model.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.893
Yes.
There are lots of different

00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:41.337
ways of conceiving what it means
to have a minority group at work

00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:44.273
in these novels,
and I think Franny and Zooey

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:47.482
definitely imagines a
minority group as the Glass

00:13:47.482 --> 00:13:49.478
family.
They're big enough to be a

00:13:49.478 --> 00:13:51.103
group.
There are lots of children,

00:13:51.103 --> 00:13:53.100
so you get that sense that
they're a clan;

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.350
they're sort of a tribe of
themselves.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.801
They have this peculiar
quality, their intellectual sort

00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:03.363
of complexity,
and also their artistic gifts,

00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:06.519
especially their gifts in
language.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:10.267
And there is a conflict between
Franny and Zooey,

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:14.718
and Zooey is really held out as
the custodian of the Glass

00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:18.801
family identity,
so it's he who instructs Franny

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:22.379
and brings her finally back in
to the fold,

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:26.679
and that's an example of the
comic ending.

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:28.450
Other examples from other
novels.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.760
Can anyone do this for
Bluest Eye?

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:46.429
How might Pecola be an
example of this?

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:48.633
Okay.
Let me do it.

00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:56.102
Pecola goes up to the whores'
apartment and finds there a kind

00:14:56.102 --> 00:15:03.204
of love and acceptance from
those women that does not judge

00:15:03.204 --> 00:15:09.502
her for her ugliness,
that surrounds her with a rich

00:15:09.502 --> 00:15:14.490
verbal culture as well as a
culture of affection.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:21.049
It is a group that has seceded
from the black community itself

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:24.919
but still maintains a certain
tie.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:28.738
Remember the prostitutes'
admiration for the good

00:15:28.738 --> 00:15:32.276
Christian woman.
That ties them to the

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:36.389
prevailing norms of the black
community.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:42.562
So, Pecola finds an ideal black
community within that small

00:15:42.562 --> 00:15:48.415
apartment, but she is alienated
from that positive black

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:54.268
self-image that she sees in
those women by her desire to

00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:59.619
identify with white beauty,
to have blue eyes,

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:03.809
and so that's how she would
embody this.

00:16:03.809 --> 00:16:09.950
Frieda is also an example of
this, Frieda and Claudia.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.840
So, actually,
if we take the example of

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.099
Claudia, Claudia wants to be
like, remember the girl they

00:16:17.099 --> 00:16:20.750
called Meringue Pie,
the light-skinned girl?

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.368
She wants to be like her,
but at the same time she

00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:30.269
recognizes a certain insipid
quality to this girl.

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:34.376
She doesn't have the kind of
strength that Claudia and

00:16:34.376 --> 00:16:37.320
Frieda, with the addition of
Pecola,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.207
have as a little group that
doesn't pass judgment on their

00:16:43.207 --> 00:16:45.917
own blackness.
So that, again,

00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:48.878
between Claudia,
Frieda and Pecola there is

00:16:48.878 --> 00:16:51.909
another small idealized black
community,

00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:55.304
but Claudia is somewhat
conflicted, both about her

00:16:55.304 --> 00:16:59.902
membership in that little group,
and her difference from the

00:16:59.902 --> 00:17:04.969
influx of white blood into that
community, and white aesthetic

00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:07.677
into that community.
So, she echoes,

00:17:07.677 --> 00:17:10.337
in a less dramatic way,
the same kinds of conflicts

00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:11.720
that you see in Pecola.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.425
The fourth quality of the
Identity Plot is that

00:17:18.425 --> 00:17:21.820
authenticity and origin are
always at stake in the

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.869
character's quest for personal
identity,

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.470
even when those things are
absent.

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.528
So, in the Woman
Warrior, we have an

00:17:33.528 --> 00:17:38.926
excellent example of this,
in the beginning of the last

00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:45.756
chapter that I asked you to
read, after she tells the whole

00:17:45.756 --> 00:17:52.231
story of Moon Orchid and Brave
Orchid going to find Moon

00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:58.472
Orchid's Chinese husband and
confronting him with Moon

00:17:58.472 --> 00:18:03.299
Orchid's status as the first
wife.

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:09.164
After you get this whole richly
imagined story full of dialog,

00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:13.772
the next chapter begins:
What my brother actually

00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:17.662
said was "I drove Mom and second
Aunt to Los Angeles to see

00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:20.480
Aunt's husband who got the other
wife."

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.060
"Did she hit him?
What did she say?

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.030
What did he say?"
"Nothing much.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.190
Mom did all the talking."
"What did she say?"

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.090
"She said he'd better take them
to lunch at least."

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.110
"Which wife did he sit next to?
What did they eat?"

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.080
"I didn't go.
The other wife didn't either.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.119
He motioned not to tell."
"I would have told.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.089
If I was his wife I would have
told.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:44.660
I would have gone to lunch and
kept my ears open."

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.840
"Oh, you know they don't talk
when they eat."

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.589
"What else did Mom say?"
"I don't remember.

00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:54.640
I pretended a pedestrian broke
her leg so he would come."

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.801
"There must have been more.
Didn't Aunt get in one nasty

00:18:57.801 --> 00:18:59.890
word?
She must have said something."

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.250
"No.
I don't think she said anything.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.369
I don't remember her saying one
thing."

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:11.074
In fact, it wasn't me my
brother told about going to Los

00:19:11.074 --> 00:19:14.884
Angeles.
One of my sisters told me what

00:19:14.884 --> 00:19:21.104
he had told her.
The layers of inauthenticity in

00:19:21.104 --> 00:19:25.569
the origin of this story are
deep.

00:19:25.569 --> 00:19:30.481
There is no sense that the
story we have just been told in

00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:33.670
great detail has any basis in
fact,

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:41.170
and yet this is a book that is
patently autobiographical.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.550
It plays up the inauthenticity
and the unreliability of this

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.111
voice.
We know that we cannot trust

00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:56.380
the details of what is given to
us, and yet the narrative tries

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.462
to seduce us with them,
tries to persuade us by their

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:04.760
very dramatic quality,
and their detail,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.326
and by the way these stories
embody the voices of their

00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:14.160
characters,
that these are real stories.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.107
So, the voice in Kingston that
purports to be a source of

00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:28.798
identity formation--she's going
to write herself into being--is

00:20:28.798 --> 00:20:33.901
an inauthentic voice.
Now there was a controversy

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:37.043
about Maxine Hong Kingston.
Actually, it's been going on

00:20:37.043 --> 00:20:40.240
for many decades.
It goes on today.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.454
There is a scholar of Chinese
American literature named Frank

00:20:43.454 --> 00:20:47.089
Chin.
He's also a novelist himself.

00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:51.833
He has accused Kingston and a
few other writers,

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:56.778
in the starkest terms,
of being fakes and of being

00:20:56.778 --> 00:21:03.440
against Chinese culture and of
being puppets of white culture.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.346
Kingston's use of Chinese
literature has come under

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:12.342
particular attack from Chin,
and this happened in one of its

00:21:12.342 --> 00:21:17.218
incarnations or one of its
iterations of this feud between

00:21:17.218 --> 00:21:19.592
the two.
It actually happened at a

00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:22.743
conference, face to face,
and I know you must think that

00:21:22.743 --> 00:21:25.779
academic conferences are always
a thrill a minute.

00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:31.723
It's not really usual that they
are, but I guess in this case it

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:33.063
was.
So, Frank Chin,

00:21:33.063 --> 00:21:34.920
I guess, shouted her off the
stage.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.193
I don't know all the details,
but it was very exciting,

00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:40.372
I'm sure.
Nevertheless,

00:21:40.372 --> 00:21:46.177
the argument is serious.
It's an argument about

00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:51.840
authenticity,
the authenticity of Kingston's

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.913
use of Chinese literature.
So, imagine someone saying to

00:21:57.913 --> 00:22:02.957
John Barth, "Wait a minute.
You changed the story of The

00:22:02.957 --> 00:22:06.950
Odyssey.
You're a fake."

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.765
That's essentially what Frank
Chin says to Maxine Hong

00:22:09.765 --> 00:22:13.720
Kingston.
It has a kind of traction to a

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.113
certain audience,
because the purity of an origin

00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:24.769
of that kind matters,
if you think that that's where

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:28.420
authenticity of an identity
resides.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.271
So, if it's a cultural
identity at stake,

00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.769
the authenticity seems to
matter in a different way.

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:39.141
Now, Barth can give us a
different kind of example of

00:22:39.141 --> 00:22:41.001
this.
Authenticity:

00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:46.769
Is Menelaus' voice in The
Menelaiad really his own?

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:53.120
Is there some being left over
that's apart from that voice?

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.250
He says, "My voice diddles on."
Well, who's the "my"?

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.630
Is he just reducible to that
voice?

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:07.150
Is he Proteus?
Is Proteus him?

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:14.151
Has his identity been lost in
his wrestling with that changing

00:23:14.151 --> 00:23:17.079
god?
The question of authenticity

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:22.039
haunts Menelaus.
It haunts Ambrose when he is in

00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:28.890
the throes of passion and he
feels alienated from himself.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:34.660
"This is passion.
I am experiencing it."

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.159
That's a kind of inauthenticity.
He can't be grounded in the

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:45.440
origin of identity that we think
of as the body.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:53.349
So, a lot of these novels make
a problem out of authenticity.

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:57.774
When it doesn't seem like a
problem, a novel is making a

00:23:57.774 --> 00:24:02.359
certain kind of claim about
identity right off the bat,

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:05.769
and that's that authenticity
doesn't matter.

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:10.278
But in the context of the
Identity Plot you know that it's

00:24:10.278 --> 00:24:15.025
on the radar screen even if it
isn't something that is in the

00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:21.359
novel itself;
it's there by its negative.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:23.696
Finally,
there are comic versions and

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:27.258
tragic versions of the Identity
Plot, just as there are of the

00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:30.228
Marriage Plot.
So, the comic version gives us

00:24:30.228 --> 00:24:33.490
characters that come to peace
with their identity.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.779
My favorite example of this is
actually a novel we're not

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:37.986
reading in this course,
although I could have added it,

00:24:37.986 --> 00:24:40.029
couldn't I?
I could have done ten novels in

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:43.170
the first seven weeks.
I won't ask you to read it.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.329
It's Barbara Kingsolver's
Pigs in Heaven.

00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:51.512
In this novel,
this is the most extreme

00:24:51.512 --> 00:24:55.146
example I know.
I can't remember the full

00:24:55.146 --> 00:24:58.993
details, now,
but in that novel there is a

00:24:58.993 --> 00:25:03.356
native American woman.
There is a native American

00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:06.847
child who's adopted,
forcibly, in the forcible

00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:11.152
adoptions, by a white family.
I think this is how the story

00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:13.006
goes.
And, eventually,

00:25:13.006 --> 00:25:17.806
after the Indian family tries
to get that child back,

00:25:17.806 --> 00:25:22.329
it is discovered that the
adoptive mother was,

00:25:22.329 --> 00:25:30.670
in fact, a member of that tribe
by a very diluted blood line.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:36.317
And the adoptive mother marries
the child's full-blood

00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:41.432
grandfather: perfect,
perfect comic ending for an

00:25:41.432 --> 00:25:43.990
Identity Plot novel.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:53.457
I would say that The Bluest
Eye is our tragic version of

00:25:53.457 --> 00:25:57.210
this, where Pecola will never be
at peace.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:03.955
She is in fact deranged by her
conflicted relationship to

00:26:03.955 --> 00:26:07.605
identity.
Now, here is where we need

00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:12.099
a distinction between literary
fiction and genre fiction.

00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:14.890
Now, I could get in to lots of
trouble for these claims.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.067
They're fairly broad,
and ideally I would want to

00:26:18.067 --> 00:26:21.245
give them more nuance,
but I think it's useful to

00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:25.895
think about this distinction.
Incarnations of these kinds of

00:26:25.895 --> 00:26:30.743
narrative conventions that we
think of as literary use those

00:26:30.743 --> 00:26:35.098
structures of narrative as
something to play off of or

00:26:35.098 --> 00:26:39.699
something to inhabit while they
do a whole bunch of other

00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:44.216
things.
Think of the ways that Humbert

00:26:44.216 --> 00:26:51.172
and Nabokov use the conventions
of Romantic language to make us

00:26:51.172 --> 00:26:56.109
believe that Humbert really
loves Lolita.

00:26:56.109 --> 00:27:00.442
There is something operatic
about the extremity of the

00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:04.448
situation we're given,
the extremity of the use of

00:27:04.448 --> 00:27:10.410
those conventions in Lolita.
Well, in this case some of

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:16.612
our Identity Plot novels use
that plot to say something about

00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:22.089
language, about literary
history, about tradition.

00:27:22.089 --> 00:27:26.607
Some of them simply give us
aesthetic pleasure,

00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:32.106
like the pleasure that we can
get from watching Barth use

00:27:32.106 --> 00:27:36.819
words, make them funny,
be clever with them.

00:27:36.819 --> 00:27:39.989
So, they may deliver an
artistic satisfaction that has

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:42.740
nothing to do with the Identity
Plot itself.

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:50.901
Then there are incarnations
of it that don't reflect on any

00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:56.395
of those aesthetic issues,
don't reflect on the history of

00:27:56.395 --> 00:28:01.636
the literary tradition,
don't engage questions about

00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:04.615
language,
that deliver instead

00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:08.192
conventional,
predictable satisfactions of

00:28:08.192 --> 00:28:12.730
the genre, and these we would
call genre fiction.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.261
And, if you recall,
Nabokov talks a little bit

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:20.420
about pornography as genre
fiction that gives you that

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.422
predictable mechanical
frisson of pleasure at

00:28:24.422 --> 00:28:28.995
the predictable place,
and he describes Lolita

00:28:28.995 --> 00:28:33.380
as rejecting the convention
of pornography.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.432
You can think about his
description as applying also to

00:28:37.432 --> 00:28:41.109
the Identity Plot,
that sometimes it functions,

00:28:41.109 --> 00:28:45.379
and I think the Kingsolver
novel really is a good example

00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:49.344
of this, where there are
predictable pleasures of the

00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:53.385
child being enveloped by a
loving family after all the

00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:58.733
complications of her identity,
finally it can all be resolved,

00:28:58.733 --> 00:29:03.605
or there's a kind of pleasure
in that feeling that it could

00:29:03.605 --> 00:29:07.480
never be resolved,
that tragic feeling.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.190
So, there's genre fiction that
can end that way too.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.188
So, other examples of genre
fiction: of course,

00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:18.142
the detective novel is another.
My argument today is not to say

00:29:18.142 --> 00:29:23.476
that this is the only convention
that our novels are working

00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:27.000
with.
The detective genre is present

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.127
in Crying of Lot 49.
That's something that you

00:29:31.127 --> 00:29:34.837
can think about productively
when you think about Oedipa's

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:38.993
search for knowledge and clues.
There is a way that Pynchon is

00:29:38.993 --> 00:29:41.390
playing off that convention as
well.

00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:50.108
To make the distinction is not
to reject one for the other,

00:29:50.108 --> 00:29:54.206
so literary fiction and genre
fiction are both part of what

00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:58.021
literary scholars use to make
especially these kinds of

00:29:58.021 --> 00:30:02.721
broad-scale arguments.
So, it's not really enough,

00:30:02.721 --> 00:30:07.287
if you want to argue about a
whole period of literary

00:30:07.287 --> 00:30:12.380
history, to only skim off the
very most literary works.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.237
Your argument doesn't have a
lot of historical purchase if

00:30:17.237 --> 00:30:20.898
you do that.
If your ambition is to talk

00:30:20.898 --> 00:30:25.470
about more narrowly the
evolution of an art form,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:30.592
that's a very legitimate move
to make, to skim off just those

00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:34.261
literary examples,
but if your ambition is to say

00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:37.660
something through your
discussion of literature about

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.428
culture,
about politics,

00:30:39.428 --> 00:30:42.502
about any other set of issues,
philosophical,

00:30:42.502 --> 00:30:45.896
historical questions,
you want to be able to

00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:49.955
demonstrate that the things
you're seeing in literary

00:30:49.955 --> 00:30:54.403
fiction have a wider purchase
and have grabbed hold of the

00:30:54.403 --> 00:30:59.164
imagination of a larger set of
people than the people who read

00:30:59.164 --> 00:31:02.960
high literary novels.
So, you can make different

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.615
kinds of claims depending on
what combination of these kinds

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.040
of examples you use.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.160
The Identity Plot obviously
has infinite variations.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.740
I mentioned just a few to get
you thinking about them.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.900
The character seems to be a
member of the majority group.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.003
This is actually,
in one sense,

00:31:29.003 --> 00:31:32.579
Franny and Zooey's case,
as you mentioned.

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:36.780
It seems like they are much
more in a majority.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.735
They're white;
they are from an upper-class

00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:45.818
section of New York;
they're distinguished by their

00:31:45.818 --> 00:31:50.966
family's intellectualism.
Similarly, Ambrose could be

00:31:50.966 --> 00:31:54.984
said to be in the majority
group, and certainly by the

00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:58.849
definition of someone like
Morrison or Kingston,

00:31:58.849 --> 00:32:04.820
that fiction--they're members
of a white Anglo-Saxon

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.972
Protestant heritage,
the members of Ambrose's

00:32:09.972 --> 00:32:13.012
family.
But, if you recall,

00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:17.809
in Ambrose His Mark the
family is eccentric.

00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:24.377
They, too, are marked by their
difference from the churches in

00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:30.945
town, the independence of their
thinking, the skill with which

00:32:30.945 --> 00:32:36.279
they carve;
they have artistic skills.

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:39.050
The character does not seem to
be conflicted about his

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.880
membership in the minority
group.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.569
This can happen.
Where do you get the drama,

00:32:44.569 --> 00:32:47.908
then?
Well, sometimes you get the

00:32:47.908 --> 00:32:53.837
drama from the efforts of the
majority group against that

00:32:53.837 --> 00:32:59.477
piece.
Will that person betray their

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:03.991
group or not?
So, that's where the narrative

00:33:03.991 --> 00:33:07.369
tension can come,
if you see this variation.

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:12.281
The character resists the whole
idea of having an identity

00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:16.075
that's stable.
You might think of Kingston as

00:33:16.075 --> 00:33:20.021
an example of this,
although I think you can argue

00:33:20.021 --> 00:33:23.823
it both ways.
Certainly, she's not going to

00:33:23.823 --> 00:33:28.069
think you can have an identity
that stays still.

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:31.760
All those self-revisions,
even just from that little

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.740
passage that I read about where
her story comes from,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.122
that's a suggestion that she's
committed to an identity that's

00:33:41.122 --> 00:33:44.121
changeable.
As this period moves on

00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:48.441
towards the end of the twentieth
century, that variation is much

00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:51.859
more common;
it gets more and more common.

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:55.997
The critique of identity in
theory, in the world of literary

00:33:55.997 --> 00:34:00.204
theory--think of the work of
Judith Butler for example in the

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:04.481
late '80s and stretching into
the present--very influential on

00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:08.688
undermining the idea that you
could have a stable identity at

00:34:08.688 --> 00:34:10.870
all.
And that's where that term

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.778
"essentialism," identity
essentialism,

00:34:12.778 --> 00:34:16.272
comes from.
That's a very negative idea by

00:34:16.272 --> 00:34:19.600
now, by this point,
but in the 1970s,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.760
and I would argue that in
Morrison's work,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.972
you see still a commitment to
the idea that you can really be

00:34:30.972 --> 00:34:35.420
in a peaceful way African
American,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.815
and that that's a stable,
grounded identity,

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:42.290
or even that you can be white
as a stable,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:47.303
grounded identity.
So, I think some writers

00:34:47.303 --> 00:34:53.140
earlier in the period persist in
that idea, even while most have

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.679
gone to the sense that identity
is not stable.

00:34:57.679 --> 00:35:01.578
There may be multiple
characters whose identities are

00:35:01.578 --> 00:35:05.476
at stake in the novel,
and some subplots might end up

00:35:05.476 --> 00:35:07.949
as tragedies,
some as comedy.

00:35:07.949 --> 00:35:10.489
You can have a variation with
fiction based on fact.

00:35:10.489 --> 00:35:17.510
We've seen that both in Richard
Wright, and now in Kingston.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.923
It raises the stakes of the
fiction, and it suggests its

00:35:22.923 --> 00:35:28.238
purchase on the real to write a
fiction that is sort of

00:35:28.238 --> 00:35:32.333
autobiography,
based partly in fact or mostly

00:35:32.333 --> 00:35:35.122
in fact.
It suggests that what's going

00:35:35.122 --> 00:35:39.162
on in the fiction is actually
very close to what we live,

00:35:39.162 --> 00:35:43.420
and that's a kind of claim for
fiction in and of itself.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.832
And this is an example,
this last one:

00:35:49.832 --> 00:35:53.159
Identity is not based on race
or ethnicity.

00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:57.303
When we think about identity,
we usually think of race or

00:35:57.303 --> 00:36:02.039
ethnicity but sometimes minority
status is going to be claimed or

00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:06.478
identity is going to be claimed
on religious or philosophical

00:36:06.478 --> 00:36:11.140
grounds or just on the grounds
of personality difference,

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.042
someone who's strange.
Salinger is sort of fond of

00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:18.079
this.
Catcher in the Rye is an

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:21.904
example, I think,
of this, where Holden Caulfield

00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:26.047
is at odds with his world
because he just sees things

00:36:26.047 --> 00:36:27.960
really differently.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.771
One of the kinds of claims that
you have to be prepared to make,

00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:40.719
if you're making these broad
period-based claims,

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:46.570
is that your claim is specific
to your particular time period.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.309
Now, you have to define your
time period.

00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:54.906
I am dealing with post World
War II American literature,

00:36:54.906 --> 00:36:58.750
somewhat arbitrary cutoff for
some scholars.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.639
I think there are reasons to
think that it is a real cutoff,

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:06.595
having to do mostly with the
changes in the American cultural

00:37:06.595 --> 00:37:09.760
mass market in the years after
World War II.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.537
There are Identity Plots all
over in the history of

00:37:12.537 --> 00:37:15.169
literature.
So, the plot of mistaken

00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:18.670
identity is a staple of
Renaissance comedy.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.230
Think of Midsummer Night's
Dream, for example.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:26.650
Secret identity is a staple of
Gothic fiction.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:31.771
This happens a lot in Dickens,
other kinds of Victorian

00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:35.139
fiction.
Artistic identity.

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:39.416
Think of Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man,

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:44.739
Joyce's novel about the
artistic formation of a person.

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:46.760
That's especially important to
Modernism.

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:54.434
And you could also say that
Woman Warrior is an

00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:58.550
example of that version of
artistic self-creation.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.270
Racial identity.
There is a wonderful book

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.260
called Our America by
Walter Benn Michaels.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.792
He argues very persuasively
that there are whole ranges of

00:38:08.792 --> 00:38:13.484
genre fiction in the 1920s that
are working out the logic of

00:38:13.484 --> 00:38:16.537
race,
of a nativist logic of race in

00:38:16.537 --> 00:38:21.055
the early twentieth century,
that these novels are governed

00:38:21.055 --> 00:38:24.553
by that logic.
So, you have to be prepared to

00:38:24.553 --> 00:38:27.959
explain how your feature is
different from other

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:31.220
incarnations in the history of
literature.

00:38:35.019 --> 00:38:37.729
My contention is that the
Identity Plot,

00:38:37.729 --> 00:38:41.411
as I am describing it,
becomes a preoccupation of both

00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:45.510
literary and genre varieties of
writing in this period,

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.477
so that suggests its scope,
that it's not just the concern

00:38:49.477 --> 00:38:54.144
of a few writers;
it's the concern of lots of

00:38:54.144 --> 00:38:56.410
writers.
It's different in the degree of

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.994
its presence.
So, while Walter Benn Michaels

00:38:59.994 --> 00:39:05.614
argues very persuasively for the
racial logic of popular

00:39:05.614 --> 00:39:07.974
Westerns,
for example,

00:39:07.974 --> 00:39:12.039
or for its relevance to Willa
Cather's work,

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:17.996
it doesn't sit at the center of
the plots of those novels in the

00:39:17.996 --> 00:39:22.185
same way.
He can tease out the logic,

00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:28.766
but it's not because that logic
is what the whole novel's drama

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:31.000
hangs on.
Some of the drama hangs on

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.179
that, but in the novels I am
talking about in this period,

00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:36.797
it has risen to the level of
formula such that you can hang

00:39:36.797 --> 00:39:38.980
the whole plot on that
structure,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.110
and it's recognizable,
immediately recognizable.

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:48.244
So, that's what I mean when
I say in the next bullet point

00:39:48.244 --> 00:39:52.370
that it achieves a kind of
solidity of formulaic structure.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:03.070
And finally I want to argue,
as I have been doing in passing

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:08.443
in the last few lectures,
that these novels are working

00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:12.712
very closely with things that
are happening in the culture in

00:40:12.712 --> 00:40:17.097
general: so,
that tension between activism

00:40:17.097 --> 00:40:23.960
and personal growth in the 1960s
as modes of social action,

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.987
the question about whether you
can intervene in politics

00:40:31.987 --> 00:40:35.739
through culture,
is everywhere in the 1960s.

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:39.877
And you can see it come to a
head in the 1990s with the

00:40:39.877 --> 00:40:42.558
culture wars,
when both liberals and

00:40:42.558 --> 00:40:45.469
conservatives begin to fight
over,

00:40:45.469 --> 00:40:50.389
especially over,
the syllabi of courses like

00:40:50.389 --> 00:40:53.937
this.
So, if you think that it's

00:40:53.937 --> 00:41:00.382
worth fighting a political fight
over the syllabus that we all

00:41:00.382 --> 00:41:06.510
read, you are already committed
to a cultural politics.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:11.862
So, the end point of this
is a very widespread argument in

00:41:11.862 --> 00:41:15.460
the 1990s about where politics
happens,

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:21.469
and that argument revolves
around novels that feature the

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:28.016
Identity Plot 'cause those are
the kinds of novels that people

00:41:28.016 --> 00:41:34.455
thought of as either advancing
or resisting the hegemony of a

00:41:34.455 --> 00:41:41.860
white Western tradition that was
oppressive to minority people.

00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:49.492
By the way, this final
incarnation of the Identity Plot

00:41:49.492 --> 00:41:52.961
is going to be very important to
us when we read The Human

00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:55.171
Stain.
That novel is deeply

00:41:55.171 --> 00:41:57.889
embedded in that final iteration
of it.

00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:00.500
How else do you know it's a
dominant convention?

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.522
Well, it has an end.
This is another way you can

00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:07.260
locate its historical
specificity.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.176
So, it has its limits,
and you can see it coming to

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:17.289
its end when you see more
elaborate embellishment and

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:21.894
variation on that formula,
that writers of ambition have

00:42:21.894 --> 00:42:25.913
to push it further and further.
Even writers of the genre

00:42:25.913 --> 00:42:31.091
fiction versions have to address
an audience looking for the

00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:34.425
familiar pleasure,
but with just enough

00:42:34.425 --> 00:42:38.063
difference.
You can think of those

00:42:38.063 --> 00:42:42.276
Hollywood chase scenes.
They all look so much alike,

00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:46.146
but the new ones always have to
have just that little bit more

00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:52.045
interesting special effect,
or that much more dramatic car

00:42:52.045 --> 00:42:58.672
flying off some high parapet.
Same thing with any narrative

00:42:58.672 --> 00:42:59.490
formula.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:07.173
And there comes a time when
writers of ambition simply

00:43:07.173 --> 00:43:11.301
change the subject.
And I'm going to argue that

00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:15.949
even though Roth is still
thinking in these terms,

00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:21.515
the other novelists that we're
reading--starting next week and

00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:25.621
into the end of the
semester--are beginning to

00:43:25.621 --> 00:43:29.467
change the subject.
So one subject that comes up

00:43:29.467 --> 00:43:33.150
very powerfully in those novels
is the subject of history.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:39.510
It's not unrelated to identity,
but it is distinctly different.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:45.323
And so, in Cormac McCarthy for
example, there is a palpable

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:49.214
engagement with history.
And in Edward P.

00:43:49.214 --> 00:43:53.951
Jones, in a novel that really
seems like a classic outgrowth

00:43:53.951 --> 00:43:58.756
of the Identity Plot novels,
especially of Toni Morrison,

00:43:58.756 --> 00:44:03.472
is really much more about the
terror of history than it is

00:44:03.472 --> 00:44:07.920
about the dramas of identity.
So, we will see how that

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.570
subject gets changed.

00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:18.902
When we read the Woman
Warrior we might feel that

00:44:18.902 --> 00:44:24.327
it is very, very conventional
because it does so much of what

00:44:24.327 --> 00:44:29.210
I have just described that the
Identity Plot does.

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:35.789
I think, in a way,
that would be shortchanging it.

00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:42.400
Some novels look dated or look
formulaic because they have been

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.909
incredibly successful,
and I think The Bluest Eye

00:44:46.909 --> 00:44:50.807
and Woman Warrior are
examples of those kinds of

00:44:50.807 --> 00:44:53.135
novels.
Woman Warrior,

00:44:53.135 --> 00:44:57.233
and this is one of Frank
Chin's quarrels with it,

00:44:57.233 --> 00:45:00.898
is widely, widely taught.
I always think hard about

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:04.425
including it on my syllabus.
Sometimes that's a reason to

00:45:04.425 --> 00:45:07.768
include it on a syllabus,
as evidence in an ongoing,

00:45:07.768 --> 00:45:10.550
unfolding argument;
sometimes it isn't.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:14.489
In this case I have decided
pretty securely that it is;

00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:18.537
it belongs here as a piece of
evidence in this unfolding

00:45:18.537 --> 00:45:22.880
argument about what's happening
in the historical period.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.679
Woman Warrior is widely
taught.

00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:31.437
It is one of the foremost
examples of this kind of

00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:36.281
identity writing.
It has some literary

00:45:36.281 --> 00:45:40.080
satisfactions.
Some of those stories are

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.719
really compelling.
She's very good at limning a

00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:46.778
character.
She's wonderful at reproducing

00:45:46.778 --> 00:45:51.296
the dialog.
She reflects on the quality of

00:45:51.296 --> 00:45:54.880
writing.
She is self-conscious about the

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.589
construction of her narrative.
And so, we can see an artist

00:45:59.589 --> 00:46:04.265
telling the story of her own
coming to being as an artist in

00:46:04.265 --> 00:46:08.567
the way she tells these stories.
There's all kinds of things you

00:46:08.567 --> 00:46:12.410
can close read in here.
I'm going to run out of time.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:19.690
Let me just show you one thing.
This is at the very end at 207.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.364
This is when she is told the
story about her grandmother

00:46:23.364 --> 00:46:27.885
taking the family to the opera,
and how bandits tend to rob the

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:32.739
houses that have been abandoned
while families are at the opera.

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:38.668
Instead, in this case,
the bandits attack the

00:46:38.668 --> 00:46:42.869
audience.
In the experience the family's

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:46.537
all broken up in the attack:
By daybreak,

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:49.168
when my grandmother and mother
made their way home,

00:46:49.168 --> 00:46:51.010
the entire family was home
safe,

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.191
proved to my grandmother that
our family was immune to harm as

00:46:55.191 --> 00:46:58.990
long as they went to plays.
They went to many plays after

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.029
that.
The grandmother's logic is

00:47:01.029 --> 00:47:03.260
completely twisted here.
It's turned upside down.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:08.022
It doesn't make any sense.
They got attacked when they

00:47:08.022 --> 00:47:11.956
went to the play,
so they go to plays in order to

00:47:11.956 --> 00:47:16.710
stay safe because they happened
to survive that attack.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.774
The reason why we're given that
logic is that this book is full

00:47:20.774 --> 00:47:22.610
of stories about insanity.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.184
And remember,
from the story about Moon

00:47:29.184 --> 00:47:34.247
Orchid, insanity in this story
is defined as telling one story

00:47:34.247 --> 00:47:38.190
over and over again,
insisting on the same story.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.249
She becomes paranoid,
essentially a paranoid

00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:47.203
schizophrenic.
That means that sanity,

00:47:47.203 --> 00:47:52.743
healthiness,
is found in multiplicity,

00:47:52.743 --> 00:47:56.360
illogic.
It's a kind of contradictory

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.949
claim about the status of sanity
and storytelling.

00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:05.359
So, the illogic of this little
moment at the very end of the

00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:10.769
book reaches back to all those
other examples of illogic and

00:48:10.769 --> 00:48:16.453
insanity that we see throughout:
classic new critical technique

00:48:16.453 --> 00:48:21.313
for building the meaning of a
certain trope across the

00:48:21.313 --> 00:48:23.877
writing.
The other thing,

00:48:23.877 --> 00:48:25.577
also, of course,
to think about,

00:48:25.577 --> 00:48:28.320
is the fact that this takes
place around plays,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.269
that it's art that's held out
as being the lucky thing.

00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:37.877
It's art that's at the center,
and this of course,

00:48:37.877 --> 00:48:41.117
especially the play,
reaches back to Maxine's

00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:45.535
descriptions of her childhood
drawings where she painted page

00:48:45.535 --> 00:48:50.052
after page after page of black,
worrying her teachers,

00:48:50.052 --> 00:48:54.941
but for the young Maxine what
she saw in a black page was the

00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:58.120
curtains of a theater ready to
open,

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:04.313
endless possibility.
So, it's that very appreciation

00:49:04.313 --> 00:49:09.010
of the play, of the dramatic,
shared by the grandmother,

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:13.904
repeated even in this
inarticulate artistic creation

00:49:13.904 --> 00:49:19.662
of the child that builds the
sense of artistic identity as an

00:49:19.662 --> 00:49:21.390
inherited one.

00:49:25.019 --> 00:49:29.381
So, I'm not going to go on with
this, but I just show you that

00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:33.743
little passage and suggest some
of the ways that it's built up

00:49:33.743 --> 00:49:38.033
over the course of the book to
show you that Kingston's novel

00:49:38.033 --> 00:49:42.180
or autobiography--even though it
fulfills the convention so

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.470
completely that it looks like
genre fiction--if you locate it

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:49.760
in 1976 when it was first
published,

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.710
it's not at the end of a long
line of these;

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:55.390
it's at the beginning.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:03.295
So, it is one of the first
popular books to bring together

00:50:03.295 --> 00:50:07.838
Barth's insights with those of
the identity politics beginning

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:11.349
in the '60s.
So, Morrison and Kingston,

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:14.750
both, are some of the first to
take modernist

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.079
self-consciousness about writing
and combine it with this

00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:22.743
interest in identity.
So, that's why I think it sort

00:50:22.743 --> 00:50:25.829
of doesn't do her justice to see
this as genre fiction,

00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:30.471
as too predictable,
because it was one of the early

00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:33.893
versions of it.
So, next week we're going to

00:50:33.893 --> 00:50:36.724
start reading
Housekeeping--just hold

00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:39.884
on one sec--and I want you to
think about whether

00:50:39.884 --> 00:50:43.440
Housekeeping fits the
Identity Plot model,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.378
and, if it does,
how it does,

00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:47.869
and if it doesn't,
how it doesn't.

00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:51.255
That Identity Plot model was
very influential in its early

00:50:51.255 --> 00:50:54.700
reception, so I want you to
think about how that worked.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.700
Thank you.

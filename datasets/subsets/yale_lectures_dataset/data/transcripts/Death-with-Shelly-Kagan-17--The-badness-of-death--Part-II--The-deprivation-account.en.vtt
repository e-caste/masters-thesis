00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.009
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time we made the turn from

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.975
metaphysics to value theory.
We started asking about what it

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.690
is about death that makes it
bad.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.945
The first aspect of the badness
of death that we talked about

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:19.413
was the fact that when somebody
dies, that's hard on the rest of

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:22.520
us.
We're left behind having to

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.160
cope with the loss of this
person that we love.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.587
Nonetheless,
it seems likely that if we want

00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:32.409
to get clear about the central
badness of death,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.601
it can't be a matter of the
loss for those who remain

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.526
behind, but rather the loss,
the badness of death,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:43.140
for the person who dies.
That, at any rate,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.190
is what I want to focus on from
here on out.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.192
What exactly is it about my
death, or the fact that I'm

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:52.380
going to die,
that makes that bad for me?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.169
Now, I want to get clear about
precisely what it is we want to

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:59.380
focus in on here.
Now, one thing that could be

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.570
bad, obviously,
is the process of dying could

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.046
be a painful one.
It might be,

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:08.640
for example,
that I get ripped to pieces by

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.593
Bengali tigers.
And if so, then the actual

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:13.550
process of dying would be
horrible.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.637
It would be painful.
And clearly it makes sense to

00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:20.002
talk about the process of dying
as something that could

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.127
potentially be bad for me.
Although similarly,

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:26.732
I might die in my sleep,
in which case the process of

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:29.769
dying would not be bad for me.
At any rate,

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.079
I take it that most of us,
although we might have some

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.576
passing concern about the
possibility that our process of

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:39.843
dying might be a painful one,
that's not, again,

00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:43.337
the central thing we're
concerned about when we face the

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:46.318
fact that we're going to die.
It's also true,

00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:49.417
of course, that many of us
find--;here, right now,

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:52.769
while we're not actually
dying--the prospect of

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:56.342
dying to be unpleasant.
So, one of the things that's

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:59.947
bad about my death for me is
that right now I've got some

00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:04.260
unhappy thoughts as I anticipate
the fact that I'm going to die.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.557
But again, that can't be the
central thing that's bad about

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:12.855
death, because the prospect of
my death--it makes sense for

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:16.560
that to be a painful one or an
unpleasant one,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.610
only given the further claim
that death itself is bad for me.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.305
Having fear or anxiety or
concern or regret or anguish or

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:30.198
whatever it is that maybe I have
now about the fact that I'm

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:33.425
going to die,
piggybacks on the logically

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:37.090
prior thought that death itself
is bad for me.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.137
If it didn't piggyback in that
way, it wouldn't make any sense

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:45.117
to have fear or anxiety or dread
or anguish or whatever it is

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:49.070
that I may have now.
I mean, suppose I said to you,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.871
"Tomorrow something's going to
happen to you and that thing is

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:58.062
going to be simply fantastic,
absolutely incredible,

00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:00.561
absolutely wonderful."
And you said,

00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:03.971
"Well, I believe you and I have
to tell you, I'm just filled

00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.919
with dread and foreboding in
thinking about it."

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.849
That wouldn't make any sense at
all.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.567
It makes sense to be filled
with dread or foreboding or what

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.843
have you only if the thing
you're looking forward to,

00:03:15.843 --> 00:03:17.860
anticipating,
is itself bad.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.089
Maybe, for example,
it makes sense to dread going

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.981
to the dentist,
if you believe that being at

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.479
the dentist is a painful,
unpleasant experience.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.856
But if being at the dentist
isn't itself unpleasant,

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:34.300
it doesn't make sense to dread
it in anticipation.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.409
So again, if we're thinking
about the central badness of

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.117
death, it seems to me that we've
got to focus on my being

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:46.086
dead.
What is it about my

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:50.560
being dead that's bad for
me?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.382
Now, if we pose that question,
it seems as though the answer

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:58.570
should be simple and
straightforward.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.757
When I'm dead, I won't exist.
Now previously,

00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:05.990
in the first part of the class,
we spent some time saying that,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.676
look, on certain views,
there'll be a period of time in

00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:11.506
which you might be dead,
but your body might still be

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:13.376
alive.
Or you might be dead,

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:17.197
but even though your body still
exists, it's not alive,

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:20.439
but you exist as a corpse.
Put all that aside.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.184
Go to the period beyond any of
that murky stuff in the

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:26.870
short-term and just,
for simplicity,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.880
let's suppose with the
physicalists that once I die,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.720
I cease to exist.
All right.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.207
So, don't we have the answer to
what's bad about death right

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:42.430
there?
When I'm dead, I won't exist.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.684
Isn't that the straightforward
explanation about why death is

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.311
bad?
Now, what I want to say,

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:52.673
in effect, is this.
I do think the fact that I

00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:58.500
won't exist does provide the key
to getting clear about how and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.489
why death is bad.
But I don't think it's quite

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:05.610
straightforward.
I think, as we'll see,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.460
it actually takes some work to
spell out exactly how death,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.889
how nonexistence,
could be bad for me.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.490
And even having done that,
there'll be some puzzles that

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.949
remain that we'll be turning to
in a little while.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.230
So, the basic idea seems to be
straightforward enough.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.754
When I'm dead, I won't exist.
Isn't it clear that

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:30.106
nonexistence is bad for me?
Well, immediately you get an

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:32.852
objection.
You say, how could

00:05:32.852 --> 00:05:37.603
nonexistence be bad for me?
After all, the whole point of

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:43.227
nonexistence is you don't exist.
How could anything be bad for

00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:48.526
you when you don't exist?
Isn't there a kind of logical

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:52.791
requirement that for something
to be bad for you,

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:57.500
you've got to be around to
receive that bad thing?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.550
A headache, for example,
can be bad for you.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.480
But of course,
you exist during the headache.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.680
Headaches couldn't be bad for
people who don't exist.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.170
They can't experience or have
or receive headaches.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.881
How could anything be
bad for you when you don't

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.640
exist?
And in particular,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.999
then, how could nonexistence be
bad for you when you don't

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.466
exist?
So it's not,

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:27.370
as I say, altogether
straightforward to see how the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.703
answer "Death is bad for me,
because when I'm dead I don't

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:35.463
exist," how that answers
the problem, as opposed to

00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:38.629
simply focusing our attention on
the problem.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.160
How can nonexistence be bad for
me?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.233
The answer to this objection,
I think, is to be found in

00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:51.380
drawing a distinction between
two different ways in which

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.882
something can be bad for me.
On the one hand,

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.785
something can be bad for me,
we might say,

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:00.829
in an absolute,
robust, intrinsic sense.

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.691
Take a headache,
again, or some other kind of

00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:07.334
pain--stubbing your toe or
getting stabbed or whatever it

00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:11.562
is, being tortured.
Pain is intrinsically

00:07:11.562 --> 00:07:15.019
bad.
It's bad in its own right.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.089
It's something we want to avoid
for its own sake.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:24.160
And those--;Normally,
things that are bad for you are

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.040
bad intrinsically.
They're bad by virtue of their

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.245
very nature.
There's something about the way

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:35.928
they are that you don't want
those that are bad in their own

00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:37.796
right.
But there's another way of

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:40.610
something being bad for you that
it's easy to overlook.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.959
Something can be bad
comparatively.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:49.269
Something could be bad because
of what you're not getting while

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.377
you get this bad thing.
It could be what the economists

00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:56.360
call bad by virtue of "the
opportunity costs."

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.470
It's not that it's
intrinsically bad;

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.000
it's bad because while you're
doing this, you're not getting

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.590
something better.
How could that be?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:11.032
Let's have a simple example.
Suppose that I stay home and

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:15.870
watch something on TV--Deal
or No Deal.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.020
I watch this on TV and I have a
good enough time.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.989
How could that be bad for me?
Well, in terms of the first

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:24.233
notion of bad,
something being intrinsically

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:27.719
bad, it's not bad.
It's a pleasant enough way to

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:32.169
spend a half an hour,
or however long the show is on.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.704
On the other hand,
suppose what I could be doing

00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:42.590
instead of watching a half an
hour of television is being at a

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.090
really great party.
Then we might say,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.215
the fact that I'm stuck home
watching television is bad for

00:08:50.215 --> 00:08:52.990
me in this comparative
sense.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.394
It's not that it's,
in itself, an unpleasant way to

00:08:56.394 --> 00:09:00.018
spend some time;
it's just that there's a better

00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:04.970
way to spend time that I could
be doing, in principle at least.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.399
If only I'd gone.
If only I'd been invited.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:10.480
If only I remembered,
what have you.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.794
And because I'm foregoing that
better good, there's something

00:09:14.794 --> 00:09:18.894
bad, comparatively speaking,
about the fact that I'm stuck

00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:23.905
at home watching TV.
There's a lack of the better

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:25.764
good.
A lack is not

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:30.735
intrinsically bad,
but it's still a kind of bad in

00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:34.912
this second sense.
To be lacking a good is,

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:39.889
itself, bad for me.
Similarly, suppose I hold out

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:43.779
two envelopes and I say,
"Pick one."

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:46.007
And you open up the first one,
you pick the first one,

00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:48.320
and you open it up and you say,
"Hey look, ten bucks!

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.480
Isn't that good for me?"
Well, of course,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.789
ten bucks is intrinsically
good.

00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:54.115
Anyway, well,
it's not intrinsically good,

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:55.570
it's only good as a means to
buy something.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.665
But it's sort of good.
It's worth having for its own

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:01.389
right, because of what it can
get you.

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:05.056
But if unbeknownst to you,
the other envelope had $1,000

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:08.456
in it, then we can say,
"Look, it's bad for you that

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:12.220
you picked the first envelope."
Bad in what sense?

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.293
Because you would have been
better off, had you picked the

00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:19.566
second envelope.
You would have been having more

00:10:19.566 --> 00:10:21.810
good, or a greater amount of
good.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.759
Well, nonexistence can't be bad
for me in our first sense.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:35.867
It can't be that nonexistence
is intrinsically bad,

00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:38.659
worth avoiding for its own
sake.

00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:42.222
That would only make sense if
nonexistence was somehow,

00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:43.740
for example,
painful.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.053
But when you don't exist,
you have no painful

00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:48.907
experiences.
There's nothing about

00:10:48.907 --> 00:10:55.159
nonexistence in and of itself
that makes us want to avoid it.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:59.546
Nonexistence is only bad for me
in this comparative sense,

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:03.184
because of the lack.
When I don't exist,

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:06.419
I'm lacking stuff.
What am I lacking?

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:09.679
Well, of course,
what I'm lacking is life

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:13.493
and more particularly still,
the good things that

00:11:13.493 --> 00:11:17.671
life can give me.
So, nonexistence is bad by

00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:23.009
virtue of the opportunity costs
that are involved.

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:26.628
Famously, W.C.
Fields on his tombstone says,

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:30.500
"Personally,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia."

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.183
What's bad about being dead is
you don't get to experience and

00:11:36.183 --> 00:11:41.308
enjoy any longer the various
good things that life would

00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:45.526
offer us.
So nonexistence does point to

00:11:45.526 --> 00:11:49.399
the key aspect about death.
Why is death bad?

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:51.120
Because when I'm dead I don't
exist.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.116
But if we ask,
why is and how can it be the

00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:57.745
case that nonexistence is bad?
the answer is,

00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:02.360
because of the lack of the good
things in life.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.534
Because when I don't exist,
I am not getting the things

00:12:06.534 --> 00:12:10.786
that I could have otherwise
gotten, if only I were still

00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:14.013
alive.
Death is bad because it

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:18.279
deprives me of the good things
in life.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.495
This account is nowadays known
as the deprivation

00:12:22.495 --> 00:12:27.093
account of the evil or badness
of death, for obvious reasons,

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:29.272
right?
The key thought is,

00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:32.766
the central bad about death,
about nonexistence,

00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:37.227
is that it deprives you
of the goods of life you might

00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:40.850
otherwise be getting.
That's the deprivation account.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.700
And it seems to me that the
deprivation account basically

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.460
has it right.
Eventually, I'll go on to argue

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.301
that there are other aspects of
death that may also contribute

00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:57.219
to its badness,
aspects above and beyond the

00:12:57.219 --> 00:13:00.039
one that gets focused on by the
deprivation account.

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:04.659
But still, it seems to me the
deprivation account points us

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:09.120
correctly to the central thing
about death that's bad.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.208
What's most importantly bad
about the fact that I'll be dead

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.245
is the fact that when I'm dead,
I won't be getting the good

00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:17.600
things in life.
I'll be deprived of them.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.118
That's the badness of death
according to the deprivation

00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:24.552
account.
Now, if we accept the

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:27.854
deprivation account,
if we try to accept the

00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:30.926
deprivation account,
we face some further

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:34.614
philosophical puzzles.
Puzzles that many people have

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.230
thought are sufficiently
overwhelming that we,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.161
despite the initial
plausibility of the deprivation

00:13:41.161 --> 00:13:47.940
account, have to give it up.
First objection is this.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.534
Look, if something is true--a
quite general point,

00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:55.128
it seems, about metaphysics--if
something is true,

00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:58.870
there's got to be a time
when it's true.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.223
If I make some claim about a
fact, there's got to be a time

00:14:03.223 --> 00:14:06.000
when that fact is true.
Here's a fact.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.710
Shelly's lecturing to you now
about the badness of death.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.810
When is that fact true?
When was that fact true?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.679
Well, right now.
Here's another fact.

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:20.004
Shelly once lectured to you
about the nature of personal

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:22.429
identity.
When was that fact true?

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:26.758
Well, we can point to a period
of perhaps a week or two last

00:14:26.758 --> 00:14:31.159
month when I was lecturing to
you about personal identity.

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:34.580
Things that are facts can be
dated.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.000
All right.
That seems right.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.441
But if it is right,
then immediately we've got a

00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:43.440
puzzle.
How could death be bad for me?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.600
If death was bad for me,
that would be a fact.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.039
If my death is bad for me,
that would be a fact and we'd

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:51.289
ask, well, when is that fact
true?

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:54.180
We might say,
well, it's not true now.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.139
Death isn't bad for me now.
I'm not dead now.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:03.070
Maybe death is bad for me when
I'm dead?

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.240
But that seems very hard to
believe.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.228
I mean, when I'm dead,
I don't exist,

00:15:07.228 --> 00:15:10.279
right?
How could anything be bad for

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:13.389
me then?
Surely you've got to exist.

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:17.980
So, there's a puzzle about
dating the badness of death.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:24.628
Now, it may be that this puzzle
about time and the date of the

00:15:24.628 --> 00:15:29.860
badness of death is what
Epicurus had in mind.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.799
There's a passage that I'm
going to read to you in a moment

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.196
from Epicurus.
This passage has puzzled

00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:38.370
people, it has puzzled
philosophers ever since.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.072
Epicurus seems to be putting
his finger on something puzzling

00:15:42.072 --> 00:15:45.342
about death, though it's
difficult to pin down exactly

00:15:45.342 --> 00:15:49.176
what it is that's bugging him.
So we're going to try an

00:15:49.176 --> 00:15:53.693
interpretation or two.
But first, here's the passage

00:15:53.693 --> 00:15:57.949
from Epicurus.
"So death, the most terrifying

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:02.766
of ills, is nothing to us,
since so long as we exist,

00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:06.616
death is not with us;
but when death comes,

00:16:06.616 --> 00:16:10.511
then we do not exist.
It does not then concern either

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:14.328
the living or the dead,
since for the former it is not,

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:18.335
and the latter are no more."
You see, it's not altogether

00:16:18.335 --> 00:16:22.031
clear what Epicurus is bothered
by there, but one possible

00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:25.922
interpretation is this puzzle
about the timing of the badness

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:29.021
of death.
Death can't be bad for me now,

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:32.554
because I'm alive.
Death can't be bad for me when

00:16:32.554 --> 00:16:34.399
I'm dead.
I am no more;

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.470
then how can things be bad for
me then?

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.290
But if death has no time at
which it's bad for me,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:46.029
and if anything that's true,
any fact has to have a time

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:49.851
when it's true,
then the purported fact that

00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:53.940
death is bad for me can't really
be a fact.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.717
All right.
How could we respond to this

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:00.423
objection?
Well, one way of course is to

00:17:00.423 --> 00:17:02.680
accept the objection and say,
"You're right.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.788
Death isn't really bad for me."
And some philosophers have

00:17:05.788 --> 00:17:09.670
indeed accepted that very
conclusion, maybe Epicurus.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.859
Most of us want to say, "No, no.
Death is bad for me."

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.160
So we need a better answer to
the, "Oh yeah?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.780
When is it bad for you?"
objection.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.130
Two possible responses.
One possible response would be

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.770
to grab the bull by the horns
and say, "Death is bad for me.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.158
Facts do have to be dated.
Let me tell you when it's bad

00:17:31.158 --> 00:17:33.469
for me."
The other possible response is

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.719
to grab, as it were,
the other horn and say,

00:17:35.719 --> 00:17:38.632
"You know,
death is bad for me and I agree

00:17:38.632 --> 00:17:42.375
that I can't date it,
but you're wrong to assume that

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:48.746
all facts have to be datable.
There are some things that are

00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:53.490
true that we can't put a date
on."

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.277
Let's start with the second.
Could there be some things that

00:17:57.277 --> 00:17:59.690
are true that we can't put a
date on?

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:06.703
Well, here's one I think, maybe.
Suppose that on Monday I shoot

00:18:06.703 --> 00:18:09.409
John.
I wound him with the bullet

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:13.371
that comes out of my gun.
But it's not a wound directly

00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:17.110
into his heart.
He simply starts bleeding.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:22.509
And he bleeds slowly.
So he doesn't die on Monday.

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:27.049
He's wounded and he's dying,
but he doesn't die on Monday.

00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:33.200
On Tuesday, let's suppose that
I have a heart attack and I die.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.029
John's still around--bleeding,
but still around.

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:40.880
On Wednesday,
the loss of blood finally

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.670
overtakes him and John dies.
All right?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.034
So, I shoot him on Monday,
I die on Tuesday,

00:18:47.034 --> 00:18:51.869
John dies on Wednesday.
Now, I killed John.

00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:54.079
I take it we're all in
agreement about that.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:55.720
If I hadn't shot him,
he wouldn't be dead.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:02.190
I killed him.
When did I kill him?

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.510
Did I kill him on Monday,
the day I shot him?

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.130
That doesn't seem right.
He's not dead on Monday.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.100
How could I kill him on Monday?
Oh, he died on Wednesday.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.330
Did I kill him on Wednesday?
Well, how could that be?

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.390
I don't even exist on Wednesday.
I died myself on Tuesday.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.049
How can I kill him after I'm
dead?

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:26.106
So I didn't kill him on Monday,
didn't kill him--rather on

00:19:26.106 --> 00:19:28.323
Wednesday.
I didn't kill him on Monday,

00:19:28.323 --> 00:19:30.740
didn't kill him on Wednesday
when he dies.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.618
When did I kill him?
Well, maybe the answer is

00:19:33.618 --> 00:19:36.880
there's no particular time at
all when I killed him.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.259
But for all that,
it's true that I killed him.

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:40.990
What makes it true that I
killed him?

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.791
What makes it true that I
killed him is that on Monday I

00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:46.440
shot him and on Wednesday,
he died from the wound.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.310
That's what makes it true.
But when did I kill him?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.520
Maybe we can't date that.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.061
Suppose we can't.
If we can't,

00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:01.442
then there are facts that you
can't date, like the fact that I

00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:03.878
killed John.
If there are facts that you

00:20:03.878 --> 00:20:05.790
can't date, maybe here's another
one.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.259
My death is bad for me.
When is that true?

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:11.063
Can't date it,
but for all that,

00:20:11.063 --> 00:20:15.069
maybe it's true.
So maybe we shouldn't accept

00:20:15.069 --> 00:20:21.410
the assumption of the argument
that all facts can be dated.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.118
Of course, the thought that all
facts can be dated is a very

00:20:24.118 --> 00:20:25.450
powerful one,
and no doubt,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.154
many of you are going to go
home and start trying to come up

00:20:28.154 --> 00:20:30.079
with an adequate answer to the
question,

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:32.519
when exactly did Shelly kill
John?

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:35.248
And come up with an answer,
maybe, that you can even

00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:36.642
accept.
At any rate,

00:20:36.642 --> 00:20:40.825
maybe we should accept the
thought that all facts can be

00:20:40.825 --> 00:20:42.442
dated.
In which case,

00:20:42.442 --> 00:20:46.170
if we're going to want to
insist that my death is bad for

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.500
me, we'd better be able to come
up with a date.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:55.239
Well, maybe we can.
When would it be plausible to

00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:59.789
claim my death is bad for me?
Well, not now.

00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:01.410
My death can't be bad for me
now.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.472
I'm not dead.
But it's not 100% clear that

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.420
the other alternative isn't
acceptable.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.858
Why not say,
"My death is bad for me when

00:21:13.858 --> 00:21:18.114
I'm dead"?
After all, when is a headache

00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:21.450
bad for me?
When the headache is occurring.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.474
Now, according to the
deprivation account,

00:21:24.474 --> 00:21:28.679
the badness of death consists
in the fact that when you're

00:21:28.679 --> 00:21:32.220
dead, you are deprived of the
goods of life.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:38.217
So when is death bad for you?
During the time perhaps you're

00:21:38.217 --> 00:21:41.839
being deprived of the goods of
life.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:46.000
Well, when are you deprived of
the goods of life?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.305
When you're dead.
When does the deprivation

00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:52.019
actually occur?
When you're dead.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.944
So perhaps we should just say,
"Well, you were right,

00:21:54.944 --> 00:21:57.420
Epicurus," if this was
Epicurus' argument.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.421
"You were right, Epicurus.
All facts have to be dated,

00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:05.440
but we can date the
badness of death.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.349
My death is bad for me during
the time I'm dead.

00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:15.335
Because during that time,
I'm deprived of,

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:19.806
I'm not getting,
the good things in life that I

00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:24.569
would be getting if only I were
still alive."

00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:30.480
Well, that's a possible
response to the objection.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.304
But of course,
it just immediately raises a

00:22:33.304 --> 00:22:38.373
further objection.
How could it be that

00:22:38.373 --> 00:22:46.068
death is bad for me then?
How could it be that death is

00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:54.099
bad for me when I don't exist?
Surely, I have to exist in

00:22:54.099 --> 00:22:59.420
order for something to be bad
for me.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.618
Or, for that matter,
for something to be good for

00:23:04.618 --> 00:23:07.866
me.
Don't you need to exist in

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:12.759
order for something to be good
or bad for you?

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:16.142
Well, this points our way to a
different possible

00:23:16.142 --> 00:23:18.890
interpretation of Epicurus'
argument.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.706
The argument would be (A)
something could be bad,

00:23:22.706 --> 00:23:26.920
or for that matter,
good for you only if you exist;

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.609
(B) when you're dead you don't
exist;

00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:32.980
so (C) death can't be bad for
you.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.360
Put that up on the board.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:58.079
(A) Something can be bad for
you only if you exist.

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:06.540
(B) When you're dead you don't
exist.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:20.960
So, conclusion,
(C) death can't be bad for you.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.630
Maybe that's the argument that
Epicurus had in mind.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.440
Let's hear Epicurus'--the quote
from Epicurus again.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.664
"So death, the most terrifying
of ills, is nothing to us,

00:24:42.664 --> 00:24:47.329
since so long as we exist,
death is not with us;

00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:50.529
but when death comes,
then we do not exist.

00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:53.481
It does not then concern either
the living or the dead,

00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.869
since for the former it is not,
and the latter are no more."

00:24:56.869 --> 00:25:00.170
Again, the passage from
Epicurus isn't altogether clear,

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.650
but maybe he's got in mind
something like this argument.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.520
Maybe Epicurus thinks look,
(A) something can be bad for

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.291
you only if you exist;
(B) when you're dead you don't

00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:15.287
exist;
so (C) death can't be bad for

00:25:15.287 --> 00:25:15.680
you.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.093
Well, what should we say?
It's pretty clear that (B) is

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:30.692
true.
When you're dead you don't

00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:32.590
exist.
And so the conclusion,

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.793
(C) death can't be bad for you,
looks like it's going to

00:25:35.793 --> 00:25:39.400
follow, once we accept (A).
Call (A) the existence

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.956
requirement.
Something can be bad or,

00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:43.715
for that matter,
good for you,

00:25:43.715 --> 00:25:46.732
only if you exist.
That's the existence

00:25:46.732 --> 00:25:51.348
requirement for bads and goods.
If we accept the existence

00:25:51.348 --> 00:25:55.006
requirement, it looks as though
we have to accept the

00:25:55.006 --> 00:25:57.960
conclusion, death can't be bad
for you.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.707
What should we say?
Maybe what we should say is,

00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:06.079
reject the existence
requirement.

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:10.338
In the ordinary case,
pains, being blind,

00:26:10.338 --> 00:26:13.426
being crippled,
what have you,

00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:17.365
losing your job--in the
ordinary case,

00:26:17.365 --> 00:26:22.049
things are bad for you when you
exist.

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:25.540
In the ordinary case,
in order to receive bads,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.492
you've got to exist.
But perhaps that's only the

00:26:29.492 --> 00:26:32.869
ordinary case;
it's not all cases.

00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:37.314
Perhaps we should say,
look, for certain kinds of bads

00:26:37.314 --> 00:26:41.758
you don't need to even
exist in order for those

00:26:41.758 --> 00:26:45.915
things to be bad for you.
What kind of bads could be like

00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:48.109
that?
Well, of course,

00:26:48.109 --> 00:26:53.339
deprivation bads would be
exactly like that.

00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:56.960
To lack something,
you don't need to exist.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:02.522
Indeed, the very fact that you
don't exist might provide the

00:27:02.522 --> 00:27:07.519
very explanation as to why
you've got the deprivation,

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:11.334
why you've got the lack.
Not all lacks might be like

00:27:11.334 --> 00:27:13.359
that, right?
Remember the television case.

00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:17.521
You existed while you were
being deprived of the great

00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:19.650
party.
You existed while you were

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.190
getting the mere $10 instead of
the $1,000.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.029
So, sometimes deprivations
coincide with existence.

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:31.665
But the crucial point about
deprivations is you don't even

00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:35.731
need to so much as exist in
order to be deprived of

00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:39.103
something.
Nonexistence guarantees

00:27:39.103 --> 00:27:41.710
that you're deprived of
something.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.096
So perhaps we should just
reject the existence

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:48.119
requirement.
Perhaps we should say,

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:53.044
when we're talking about lacks,
when we're talking about

00:27:53.044 --> 00:27:55.730
deprivations,
(A) is wrong.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.359
We should reject the existence
requirement.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:05.990
Something can be bad for you
even if you don't exist.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.410
The existence requirement is
false.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:14.194
Well, that would be a possible
way to respond to this second

00:28:14.194 --> 00:28:18.900
possible interpretation of
Epicurus' argument.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.703
It would be a way to retain the
thought that I take it we want

00:28:22.703 --> 00:28:26.569
to have, that most of us share,
at least, that death is bad.

00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:29.806
We'd be able to retain that
thought by rejecting the

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:31.330
existence requirement.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.014
Well, easy to say that,
but there are some implications

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:46.778
of rejecting the existence
requirement that may be rather

00:28:46.778 --> 00:28:49.569
hard to swallow.
Think about exactly what it's

00:28:49.569 --> 00:28:51.369
saying.
It's saying something,

00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:53.482
for example death,
nonexistence,

00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:57.299
can be bad for somebody even
though they don't exist.

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:59.233
That's why my death can be bad
for me even though I won't

00:28:59.233 --> 00:28:59.510
exist.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.200
But if death can be bad for
somebody even though they don't

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.160
exist, then death could be bad
for somebody,

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.697
that is to say,
nonexistence could be bad for

00:29:14.697 --> 00:29:18.410
somebody, who never
exists.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:24.781
Take somebody who is a
possible person,

00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:30.035
but never actually gets born.
It's sort of hard to think

00:29:30.035 --> 00:29:32.678
about somebody like that.
So let's try to get at least a

00:29:32.678 --> 00:29:35.880
little bit more concrete.
I need two volunteers.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.890
I need a male volunteer from
the audience.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.732
Good.
Okay, you'll be the male

00:29:40.732 --> 00:29:43.431
volunteer.
And I need a female volunteer

00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:45.720
from the audience.
Come on, it won't hurt.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.880
I need a female volunteer.
Okay.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.193
What I'd like you to do after
class is go have sex and have a

00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.890
baby.
Okay.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:03.030
Now, let me just suppose that
this isn't actually going to

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.240
happen.
Sorry.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.461
Or sorry, I don't know.
Let's consider,

00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:16.434
though, the possibility never
to be actualized,

00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:22.920
the possibility that they would
have sex and have a baby.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.410
His sperm joined with her egg,
form a fertilized egg.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.910
The fertilized egg develops
into a fetus.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:37.581
The fetus is eventually born.
It's the fetus that we got by

00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:42.859
mixing egg 37 with sperm
4,000,309.

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:45.920
There's a person that
could have been born.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.710
But let's suppose,
never does get born.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:53.623
That particular person who
could have been born,

00:30:53.623 --> 00:30:56.230
let's call Larry.
Okay.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:02.293
Larry is a possible person.
It could happen,

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:08.650
but won't happen.
It could exist, but won't exist.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:16.890
Now, how many of us feel sorry
for Larry?

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:22.273
Probably nobody.
After all, Larry never even

00:31:22.273 --> 00:31:27.890
exists.
How can we feel sorry for Larry?

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.400
Now, that made perfect sense
when we accepted the existence

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.899
requirement, (A),
something can be bad for you

00:31:35.899 --> 00:31:41.050
only if you exist.
Since Larry never exists,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:46.997
nothing can be bad for Larry.
But once we give up on the

00:31:46.997 --> 00:31:50.493
existence requirement,
once we say something can be

00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:53.220
bad for you even if you never
exist,

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.290
then we no longer have any
grounds for withholding our

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.289
sympathy from Larry.
We can say, "Oh my gosh!

00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:06.795
Think of all the goods in life
that Larry would have had,

00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:12.631
if only he'd been born.
But he never is born,

00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:16.609
so he's deprived of all those
goods."

00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:20.422
And if death is bad for me,
by virtue of being deprived of

00:32:20.422 --> 00:32:24.430
the goods of life,
then nonexistence is bad for

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:29.866
Larry, by virtue of his being
deprived of all the goods of

00:32:29.866 --> 00:32:32.040
life.
I've got it bad.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.150
I'm going to die.
Larry's got it worse.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.500
We should really feel much
sorrier for Larry.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.437
But I bet none of you feels
sorry for Larry,

00:32:44.437 --> 00:32:48.799
this never-to-be-born-at-all
person.

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:52.229
Now, it's important in thinking
about this, that we not slip

00:32:52.229 --> 00:32:54.670
back into some version of the
soul view,

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.554
especially some version of the
soul view where the souls are

00:32:58.554 --> 00:33:02.262
prior existents.
You might imagine--there's a

00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:06.045
scene in Homer,
I think, where some sort of

00:33:06.045 --> 00:33:11.990
sacrifice is being made and all
the dead souls go hover around,

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:17.999
longing to be alive again,
to savor the food and taste and

00:33:17.999 --> 00:33:20.529
smells of life,
right?

00:33:20.529 --> 00:33:23.768
If you've got this picture of
the nonexistent,

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:28.230
merely potentially possible but
never-to-be born individuals as

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.980
somehow really already existing
in a kind of ghost-like state,

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.051
wishing they were born,
maybe you should feel sorry for

00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:38.517
them.
But that's not what the story

00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:42.509
is at all on the physicalist
picture that I'm assuming.

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:46.047
Nonexistent people don't have a
kind of spooky,

00:33:46.047 --> 00:33:49.200
wish-I-were-alive ghost-like
existence.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.560
They just don't exist,
full stop.

00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:59.086
So once we keep that in mind
about Larry, it's very hard to

00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:01.333
feel sorry for him.
Of course, look,

00:34:01.333 --> 00:34:04.535
since I've been going on about
how he's deprived of all the

00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:07.240
good things in life,
maybe some of you are feeling

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.283
sorry for Larry.
So it's worth getting clear

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:18.012
about just what it would mean to
take seriously the thought that

00:34:18.012 --> 00:34:24.099
it's bad for merely potential
people never to be born.

00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:30.789
How many merely potential
people are there?

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:35.050
I want you to get a sense of
just how many there are.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.957
Not just Larry,
the unborn person that would

00:34:37.957 --> 00:34:40.864
exist if we mixed whatever it
was, you know,

00:34:40.864 --> 00:34:44.650
egg 37 and sperm 4,000,029,
whatever the number was.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.725
Not just Larry,
who's a potential person who

00:34:46.725 --> 00:34:48.994
never gets born,
that would have to be an object

00:34:48.994 --> 00:34:54.205
of our sympathy,
there's a lot of merely

00:34:54.205 --> 00:34:59.300
potential, never-to-be-born
people.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.150
How many?
A lot.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:07.179
How many?
Well, I once tried to calculate.

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:10.964
Well, as you'll see,
the calculation is utterly off

00:35:10.964 --> 00:35:14.975
the back of the envelope,
sort of rough and completely

00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:18.230
inadequate in ways that I'll
point out.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:23.392
But at least it'll give you a
sense of just how many potential

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:27.547
people there are.
Let's start modestly and ask:

00:35:27.547 --> 00:35:32.553
How many possible people could
we, the current generation,

00:35:32.553 --> 00:35:34.493
produce?
Now as I say,

00:35:34.493 --> 00:35:37.489
I made this calculation some
years ago.

00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:40.469
It doesn't really matter how
inaccurate it's going to be.

00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:45.050
As we'll see,
it's very rough,

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:51.500
but it makes the point.
How many people are there?

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.019
How many possible people,
rather, could there be?

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:57.420
Well, suppose there were 5
billion people.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.420
Roughly half of them are men,
half of them are women.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.249
What we want to know then is,
how many possible people could

00:36:05.249 --> 00:36:09.751
the 2.5 billion men make
altogether with the 2.5 billion

00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:12.706
women?
The crucial point in thinking

00:36:12.706 --> 00:36:16.612
about this is to realize that
every time you combine a

00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:19.559
different egg with a different
sperm,

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:22.659
you end up with a different
person, right?

00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:24.679
If you combine an egg with a
different sperm,

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:27.066
you get a different genetic
code that develops into a

00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:30.466
different person.
You combine that sperm with a

00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:34.079
different egg,
you get a different person.

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:38.023
You know, if my parents had had
sex five minutes earlier or five

00:36:38.023 --> 00:36:40.589
minutes later,
presumably some other sperm

00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:44.290
would have joined with the egg.
That would have been not

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.310
me being born,
but some sibling being born

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.213
instead of me.
Change the egg,

00:36:49.213 --> 00:36:51.769
change the sperm,
you get a different person.

00:36:51.769 --> 00:36:55.670
So what we really want to know
is, how many sperm-egg

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:00.019
combinations are there with
roughly 5 billion people in the

00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:03.809
world?
Well, let's see.

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:13.840
There's 2.5 billion women,
billion women.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.608
How many eggs can a woman have?
Well, fertile periods,

00:37:18.608 --> 00:37:21.938
round numbers,
it's not really going to

00:37:21.938 --> 00:37:25.006
matter, precision,
roughly 30 years,

00:37:25.006 --> 00:37:31.030
roughly 12 eggs a year.
So that's how many eggs.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.353
Actually, I discovered some
time after having done this

00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:38.170
calculation that the number of
possible eggs is far greater.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.104
A woman actually ovulates and
gives off this many eggs roughly

00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:44.722
during her fertile period.
But there's many,

00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:46.730
many other cells,
I gather, that could have

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.760
developed into eggs.
So that's a much,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.840
much larger number of potential
eggs.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.420
But this will do.
30 years, 12 eggs a year.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.260
How many men?
Roughly 2.5 billion men.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:09.513
Each man has a much longer
period in which he's able to

00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:14.407
produce sperm.
Let's just be round numbers

00:38:14.407 --> 00:38:18.876
here, 50 years.
How many times a day can the

00:38:18.876 --> 00:38:22.156
man have sex?
Well, certainly more than once,

00:38:22.156 --> 00:38:25.489
but let's be modest here and
just say once a day.

00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:29.340
So that's 365 times a day--a
year.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.723
365 days a year.
365 days, I guess that should

00:38:33.723 --> 00:38:33.890
be.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.530
I wrote it too big.
I don't have space left for the

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.204
last number.
Each time the man ejaculates,

00:38:50.204 --> 00:38:55.040
he gives off a lot of sperm.
How much sperm?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.324
A lot.
As it happens,

00:38:58.324 --> 00:39:01.579
I looked this up once.
Round numbers,

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:06.579
40 million sperm each time the
man ejaculates.

00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:19.670
So this last number has got to
be times 40 million sperm.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:24.581
Okay, so we took all the men
that exist now and all the women

00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:28.429
that exist now and ask:
How many merely possible

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:30.230
people?
You know, most of these people

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.400
are never going to be born,
of course.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.289
But we're talking about
possible people.

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:36.610
How many possible people are
there?

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:42.062
There's 2.5 billion times 30
times 12 times 2.5 billion times

00:39:42.062 --> 00:39:49.494
50 times 365 times 40 million.
That equals--I'm going to round

00:39:49.494 --> 00:39:58.754
here.
That equals approximately 1.5

00:39:58.754 --> 00:40:10.320
million billion billion billion
people.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.170
That's 1.5 x 10^(33).

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:26.036
That's how many possible people
we could have,

00:40:26.036 --> 00:40:29.900
roughly speaking,
in the next generation,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:36.179
of which obviously a miniscule
fraction are going to be born.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:40.673
There's--If you're going to
feel sorry for Larry,

00:40:40.673 --> 00:40:46.289
you've got to feel sorry for
every merely possible person.

00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:49.988
Every person who could
have been born that never

00:40:49.988 --> 00:40:54.779
gets born.
And there's 1.5 million billion

00:40:54.779 --> 00:41:00.519
billion billion such people,
such possible people.

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:03.882
And of course,
the truth of the matter is,

00:41:03.882 --> 00:41:07.079
we barely scratched the surface
here.

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:13.365
Because now think of all those
people and think about all the

00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:17.869
possible children they
could have.

00:41:17.869 --> 00:41:22.610
We got this number starting
with a mere 5 billion people.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.161
Imagine the number we would get
if we then calculated how many

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:31.710
possible grandchildren we could
have.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.677
I don't mean that we could
actually have all of those

00:41:34.677 --> 00:41:37.588
people at the same time,
but for each one there is a

00:41:37.588 --> 00:41:40.099
possible person that could have
existed.

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:47.684
You quickly end up with more
possible people than there are

00:41:47.684 --> 00:41:53.528
particles in the known universe.
And that was just two

00:41:53.528 --> 00:41:55.463
generations, right?
Three generations,

00:41:55.463 --> 00:41:56.968
you're going to have more.
Four generations,

00:41:56.968 --> 00:42:01.311
you're going to have more.
If we think about the number of

00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:06.234
possible people,
people who could have existed

00:42:06.234 --> 00:42:11.485
but will never exist,
the number just boggles the

00:42:11.485 --> 00:42:14.631
mind.
And then, if we say we've

00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:19.471
gotten rid of the existence
requirement and so things can be

00:42:19.471 --> 00:42:23.409
bad for you even if you never
actually exist,

00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:28.423
then we have to say of each and
every single one of those

00:42:28.423 --> 00:42:33.257
billions upon billions upon
billions upon billions upon

00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:38.807
billions of possible people that
it's a tragedy that they never

00:42:38.807 --> 00:42:42.542
get born,
because they're deprived of the

00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:45.771
goods of life.
If we do away with the

00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:50.668
existence requirement,
then the tragedy of the unborn

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:55.754
possible people is a moral
tragedy that mere--that just

00:42:55.754 --> 00:43:00.645
staggers the mind.
The worst possible moral

00:43:00.645 --> 00:43:07.232
horrors of human history don't
begin to even be in the same

00:43:07.232 --> 00:43:12.230
ballpark as the moral horror of
the loss,

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:17.699
the deprivation for all of
these unborn possible people.

00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:24.033
Now, I don't know about you,
when I think about it,

00:43:24.033 --> 00:43:29.922
all I can say is it doesn't
strike me as being a moral

00:43:29.922 --> 00:43:34.171
catastrophe.
I don't feel anguish and sorrow

00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:36.961
and dismay at the loss,
at the lack,

00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:40.229
at the deprivation for the
untold billion,

00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:42.780
billion, billion,
billions.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:54.052
But if we give up the existence
requirement and explain the

00:43:54.052 --> 00:43:59.340
badness of my death via the
deprivation account,

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.651
we do have to say this is a
moral tragedy,

00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:09.750
the fact that the billions upon
billions are never born.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:15.098
Well, if we're not prepared to
say that's a moral tragedy,

00:44:15.098 --> 00:44:20.258
well, we could avoid that by
going back to the existence

00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:22.982
requirement.
But of course,

00:44:22.982 --> 00:44:26.913
if we do go back to the
existence requirement,

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:30.670
then we're back with Epicurus'
argument.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.750
Something can be bad for you
only if you exist.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.960
When you're dead,
you don't exist.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:41.679
So, (C), death can't be bad for
you.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:45.261
And now we've really got
ourselves in a philosophical

00:44:45.261 --> 00:44:48.599
pickle, don't we?
If I accept the existence

00:44:48.599 --> 00:44:53.063
requirement, we've got an
argument that says death isn't

00:44:53.063 --> 00:44:57.039
bad for me, which is really
rather surprising.

00:44:57.039 --> 00:45:01.144
I can keep the claim that death
is bad for me by giving up the

00:45:01.144 --> 00:45:04.399
existence requirement.
But if I give up the existence

00:45:04.399 --> 00:45:07.513
requirement, I've got to say
it's a tragedy that Larry and

00:45:07.513 --> 00:45:09.942
the untold billions,
billions, billions,

00:45:09.942 --> 00:45:13.396
billions--it's a tragedy that
they're deprived of life as

00:45:13.396 --> 00:45:18.370
well.
And that seems unacceptable.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:23.369
What should we do?
What should we say?

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:27.444
The suggestion is that the key
here is to think about the claim

00:45:27.444 --> 00:45:30.730
that I'm using deprived in two
different senses.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.715
That when we worry about my
death, I'm losing

00:45:34.715 --> 00:45:38.429
something--namely,
life--that I've had.

00:45:38.429 --> 00:45:43.298
But in the case of Larry and
the untold billions,

00:45:43.298 --> 00:45:48.637
they never had life.
And so they're not deprived of

00:45:48.637 --> 00:45:52.774
it in that same sense.
I think it's a very promising

00:45:52.774 --> 00:45:55.111
suggestion.
And indeed, I'm not 100% sure

00:45:55.111 --> 00:45:58.280
I've got exactly where you want
to go with this in mind,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.165
but I think there's a way of
taking that thought and sort of

00:46:04.165 --> 00:46:08.499
carving a middle path.
The problem effectively was

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.775
this.
If we don't throw in any

00:46:10.775 --> 00:46:14.695
existence requirement,
we have to feel sorry for the

00:46:14.695 --> 00:46:17.540
unborn billion,
billion, billions.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.645
That doesn't seem acceptable.
If we throw in the existence

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:24.771
requirement, (A),
something can be bad for you

00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:28.273
only if you exist,
we end up saying death isn't

00:46:28.273 --> 00:46:32.070
bad for me, because I'm not
existing when I'm dead.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:38.113
But maybe there's a more modest
way of understanding the

00:46:38.113 --> 00:46:42.723
existence requirement.
Or to put the point in slightly

00:46:42.723 --> 00:46:45.269
different terms,
maybe we can distinguish

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:49.280
between two different versions
of the existence requirement,

00:46:53.699 --> 00:46:59.510
a bolder and a more modest
version.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.800
Let's see.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:41.263
Here's the modest version.
Something can be bad for you

00:47:41.263 --> 00:47:51.200
only if you exist at some time
or the other.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.470
Bolder claim.

00:48:16.539 --> 00:48:26.982
Something can be bad for you
only if you exist at the same

00:48:26.982 --> 00:48:30.830
time as that thing.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.465
All right.
These are two different ways of

00:48:42.465 --> 00:48:47.710
understanding what the existence
requirement requires.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:53.429
The modest version is called
modest because it's asking less.

00:48:53.429 --> 00:48:57.806
It says something can be bad
for you only if you exist at

00:48:57.806 --> 00:49:01.987
some time or the other.
The bold existence requirement

00:49:01.987 --> 00:49:05.826
adds a stronger requirement.
It says something can be bad

00:49:05.826 --> 00:49:09.381
for you only if you exist at the
very same time as the thing

00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:11.610
that's supposed to be bad for
you.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.590
There's got to be a kind of
simultaneity.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.167
If something's bad for you,
you had better exist at the

00:49:18.167 --> 00:49:21.480
very same time that that bad
thing is happening.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.599
That's bolder than the modest
requirement.

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:26.876
The modest requirement doesn't
require that you exist that the

00:49:26.876 --> 00:49:28.809
same time as the bad
thing.

00:49:28.809 --> 00:49:33.413
It only requires that you exist
at some time or the

00:49:33.413 --> 00:49:34.060
other.

00:49:41.989 --> 00:49:44.670
One more minute,
we'll finish up.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:51.030
Suppose we accept the bold
claim.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:54.551
For something to be bad for
you, you have to exist at the

00:49:54.551 --> 00:49:58.313
very same time as the bad thing.
Then death can't be bad for

00:49:58.313 --> 00:50:01.380
you, because you don't exist at
the time of death.

00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:09.070
Suppose, however,
that we accept the modest

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.766
requirement.
For something to be bad for

00:50:11.766 --> 00:50:14.500
you, you have to exist at some
time or the other.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.925
Well, since I do exist at some
time or the other--after all,

00:50:18.925 --> 00:50:22.300
I exist right now--death can be
bad for me.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.510
Admittedly, I won't exist when
I'm dead.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.891
But that's okay.
The modest existence

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:31.769
requirement doesn't require that
I exist at the very same time as

00:50:31.769 --> 00:50:34.284
the bad thing.
The bold one did,

00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:38.699
but the modest one doesn't.
So the modest one allows us to

00:50:38.699 --> 00:50:43.338
say that death is bad for me.
But notice, and this is the

00:50:43.338 --> 00:50:46.699
crucial point,
it does not say that

00:50:46.699 --> 00:50:52.530
nonexistence is bad for Larry,
because Larry never exists at

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.415
all.
And so he doesn't even satisfy

00:50:56.415 --> 00:50:59.809
the modest existence
requirement.

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:04.111
In short, with no existence
requirement, we have to say the

00:51:04.111 --> 00:51:07.820
unexistence of the billions and
billions is bad.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.824
That seems unacceptable.
With the bold existence

00:51:11.824 --> 00:51:15.750
requirement, we have to say
death isn't even bad for me.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.293
That seems unacceptable.
But if, instead,

00:51:19.293 --> 00:51:23.639
we accept the modest existence
requirement, we're able to say,

00:51:23.639 --> 00:51:28.555
nonexistence is not bad
for Larry, but death is

00:51:28.555 --> 00:51:31.634
bad for me.
And so that's the view that it

00:51:31.634 --> 00:51:34.120
seems to me we should be looking
at.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.120
Okay.

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.933
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK,
welcome back.

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.133
I hope you had a good break. 

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.900
Can you remember back to when
we, before break, what we were 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.800
talking about? 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.967
The last thing we did was this
gyroscope bicycle-wheel 

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:19.267
precession to show what would
happen to a nucleus that was 

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:23.200
spinning in a magnetic field, or
an 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.833
electron for that matter. 

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.667
Just to rehearse it a little
bit, remember the idea of a 

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:31.800
pulse, a 90 degree pulse, that
if you have a big magnetic 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.867
field-- the blue one there,
really enormous-- 

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:40.933
and then the little magnet of
the nucleus precesses at 100 

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.933
MHz, for example, in a certain
field. 

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.267
And that gives rise to a
constant vertical field, but a 

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:51.400
rotating horizontal field from
that one. 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.233
So the question is whether that
rotating horizontal 

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.833
field, which as you see it will
be going back and forth 

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.133
and back and forth, will act as
an antenna 

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.567
and give you a signal. 

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.300
You should be able to pick up a
radio 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.067
signal at 100 MHz. 

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:06.867
Indeed, you should be able to,
except that there's not just 

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.100
one proton. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.067
There are lots of protons, and
they're in different phases of 

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:13.000
precession. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.933
So although they all add
vertically, and you have a 

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:20.067
substantial vertical magnetism
from those, their horizontal 

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:23.500
components cancel, so you don't
see anything. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.233
In fact, the energy is so small,
of the interaction of 

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.000
each of these magnets with the
field, that there are ones 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.500
pointing the opposite direction,
with higher energy, 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.333
almost exactly the same
population. 

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.300
Just a tiny, tiny difference. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.367
But we'll look just at the
excess. 

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:44.067
Obviously, ones down will cancel
ones up. 

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.733
But if we look just at the net
ones up, even they cancel, 

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.033
because they're at different
phases of rotation or 

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.200
precession about that axis. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.667
But you can do a trick. 

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:03.067
We could consider that we're
rotating with them, so that they

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.233
look like they're
standing still.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.867
And then in our frame we'll put
on a little bit of a 

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:14.033
magnetic field that's
horizontal, a very weak field. 

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.067
And now, as far as we can see,
we don't care about the big 

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:21.267
field anymore, because we've
compensated for it by orbiting 

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.867
around this thing as we're
looking at it. 

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.433
But what we see is that these
will begin to process in our 

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.133
frame around that horizontal
field, so they'll do a slow 

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.700
precession, all of them, in that
direction. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.133
So they'll be going like this. 

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:37.967
They'll start here, they'll go
there, then they'll go down, 

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.500
then they'll go back, and then
back up again. 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.567
But we're going to put on a
pulse only long enough, of 

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.367
this field, so that they go down
to here. 

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.333
That's called a 90 degree pulse,
and they'll 

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.333
rotate down like that. 

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:55.100
And now forget the rotating
frame. 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.467
They'll look like they're just
pointing out toward us in the 

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:58.833
rotating frame. 

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:03.100
But if we go back to the real
frame, the laboratory frame, 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.867
what we see is this whole bunch

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:07.900
precessing around the field. 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.800
And now as they precess around
the field in the laboratory 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.200
frame, there will be a net
horizontal field that they're 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.033
generating, a magnetic field. 

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.967
And that will be the antenna
that broadcasts a signal that 

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.833
we can hear. 

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.667
And what will determine the
frequency of that signal 

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.367
that's going to be coming out
from going back and forth, and 

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.500
back and forth or around? 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.300
What will its frequency be? 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.067
How rapidly are they precessing?

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:40.100
It says 100 MHz. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.667
And what determined the 100 MHz?

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.900
The strength of this big
magnetic field. 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.833
Remember, the more you twist on
something, 

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.033
the faster it precesses. 

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.833
So we could make it 100 MHz. 

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:53.533
If we had half as big a big
field, it'd be 50 MHz. 

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:58.300
Or twice the field, it would be
200 MHz, and so on. 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.100
So we get a signal that's 100
MHz radio frequency in 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.133
the laboratory frame, that we
could detect with an antenna. 

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:08.233
But in time it will relax. 

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.800
This is a non-equilibrium
situation when we put the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.500
energy in to make it go down. 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.067
And in time it'll come back to
equilibrium. 

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:18.000
And that process is called
relaxation. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.867
And there are various things
that control 

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.900
how fast that happens. 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.100
But it will reestablish
equilibrium, and it will be 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.867
very important later in the
lecture about this relaxation, 

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:32.900
and you'll see why. 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.400
So a 90 degree pulse makes the
spinning nuclei, protons, or 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.500
C-13s broadcast a frequency that
tells what their local 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.333
magnetic field is. 

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.967
The higher the field, the faster
they precess, the 

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:47.533
higher the frequency. 

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:51.400
Now let's first look at this as
it arises in magnetic 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.433
resonance imaging, where the
purpose is to locate protons 

00:04:55.433 --> 00:05:00.633
within the body using a
non-uniform magnetic field. 

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:04.167
Now, the idea of tomography is
important here. 

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:09.200
I've taken this from a Colorado
Physics 2000-page. 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.133
So this is a slice through
somebody's body, show their 

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.700
rib cage, spine, and so on, and
they're wearing some sort 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.067
of jacket that's opaque to
X-rays. 

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.100
And we're interested in finding
what it looks like 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.767
inside, where these things are.

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:26.833
So what we do is we take X-rays,
and send an X-ray beam 

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:29.800
straight through and see how
much gets through. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.100
And we scan the X-ray from top
to bottom, and see how much 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.700
gets through at every different
x-coordinate. 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.700
So we do a scan, and it starts
at the top, but oops, there's 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.200
something there. 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.267
And there's even more there. 

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:42.167
And lots, then a little bit
more. 

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.167
And for when we hit the spine
there's going to be quite a 

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.567
bit, and so on. 

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:49.133
But that's just a
one-dimensional 

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:51.833
picture of the density. 

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:53.700
Now what we're going to do is
take that same picture and 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.267
just smear it out to the right.

00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:02.867
So that's the profile, top to
bottom, or stomach to back, of 

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:06.700
this particular slice through
the body of bones 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.500
or whatever it is. 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.533
Now the neat trick is that you
rotate that, 

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:14.000
rotate it by 15 degrees. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.167
And now do the same thing again,
and superimpose the new 

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:20.500
one on the old one. 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.133
And now rotate another 15
degrees and do the same trick, 

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.867
scan top to bottom and add it
up. 

00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:31.200
And do it again, and again, and
again, and again, and 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.367
again, again, again, and again.

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:37.967
And see what you got now? 

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:40.500
When you superimpose all those,
you get what it looked 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.033
like, the two-dimensional slice
through the thing. 

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:45.567
So that's called tomography. 

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:49.200
If you can get a one-dimensional
projection, 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.033
and do it in lots of different
directions and add them 

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:54.867
together, you can get the
two-dimensional, or in fact, a 

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:58.633
three-dimensional picture of
what's going on inside. 

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:01.167
So that's the trick that's used,
except you want to do it 

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.633
for protons, not for bone. 

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.000
So we want to find protons in
the body. 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
For example, let's find where
there's fluid 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
water in the body. 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.700
So there's a body, and we put it
inside this cylinder and 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.767
wrap the cylinder with special
wire, that if we cool it to 

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:23.667
liquid helium temperature is
superconducting. 

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:28.200
So essentially, we've made a big
solenoid magnet that goes 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.600
along the body's axis. 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.800
Now, what will happen? 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.567
Well, suppose that field is 1.5
Tesla, which 

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:39.800
means 15,000 Gauss. 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.267
A Gauss, you remember, is about
the size of the earth's 

00:07:42.267 --> 00:07:46.833
magnetic field more or less, so
15,000 times as strong as 

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.900
the earth's magnetic field. 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.167
So what will happen to the
protons in there? 

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:55.933
Well, they're going to precess.

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:59.967
And in that field, at 15,000
Gauss or 1.5 Tesla, they'll 

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:03.467
precess at 63 MHz. 

00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:06.800
So if we put an antenna in there
and give a 90 degree 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.700
pulse, we're going to hear a
signal at 63 MHz. 

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.833
Our radio will pick that up. 

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:17.033
So we know there are protons in
the body. 

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:18.500
Surprised? 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.667
No. 

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.667
The question is, where are the
protons in the body? 

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:28.133
Now here's an analogy to figure
this out. 

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.900
Suppose we had a cricket in this
room, and 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.033
wondered where it was. 

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:35.067
But I'm blind. 

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:39.167
I can hear, but with only one
ear, so I can't hear it. 

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:42.000
I don't have spatial resolution
with my ear. 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.600
How can I find out where the
cricket is in this room? 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.833
Anybody got an idea? 

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:52.967
Well, I have one bit of control
over the room. 

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:56.033
I can make a temperature
gradient in the room, make it 

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:59.467
cold in front and warm behind. 

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:00.767
Suppose I can do that. 

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.800
Now how can I find the cricket?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.933
What? 

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:05.333
Derek? 

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:07.000
STUDENT: Crickets chirp at
different speeds at different

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.167
temperatures. and
different intervals.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:08.667
PROFESSOR: You hear it chirping.

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:15.100
You count how many there are in
13 seconds and add 40. 

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.000
You establish a temperature
gradient and you 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.433
listen with a stopwatch. 

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.333
And if you go to Snopes, you can
see that this is not an 

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.533
urban legend or a rural legend.

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:25.467
It's true that you can do that.

00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:30.433
And they actually show this
picture of Doctor LeMone from 

00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:33.400
Boulder, Colorado, who actually
did this with 

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.833
crickets, and showed that it
gives a very good measure of 

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:38.000
the temperature. 

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.667
So if I could establish a
temperature gradient from 

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:43.700
front to back, and count for 13
seconds and add 40, and 

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.200
knew what the temperature was,
I'd know how far 

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.000
from front to back. 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.200
What would I do next if I want
to find the cricket? 

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.733
I'd fiddle with the air
conditioning controls and make 

00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:57.267
a temperature gradient from left
to right. 

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:59.967
I could even make one from top
to bottom, and then I'd 

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:04.400
know what its x-, and its y-,
and its z-coordinates are. 

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.833
So I could find the cricket that
way. 

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.967
So we're going to do the same
thing with the protons in the 

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:10.300
water in the body. 

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.033
So back to the body here. 

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:16.767
What I need is not a uniform
field where all the protons 

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:18.733
are going at 63 MHz. 

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:22.100
I want to make them faster in
some regions than others. 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.900
So what I do is I put two coils
around this solenoid. 

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.767
And in the one near the head, I
make the current go that 

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:31.067
way, which reinforces the field.

00:10:31.067 --> 00:10:33.500
And in the one near the feet I
make it go that way, which 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.533
subtracts from the field. 

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:39.033
So now I've generated a gradient
along the body. 

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:41.967
And it turns out to be that
what's actually used is about 

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:45.300
40 microtesla per millimeter. 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.733
So if I went, like, 25
millimeters, about an inch, 

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:57.433
that would be 1000 microtesla,
that is a millitesla. 

00:10:57.433 --> 00:11:01.200
So it'd be about one part in
15,000. 

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.133
Or, pardon me, one part-- 

00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:08.233
it's a millitesla out of a 1.5
tesla, so about a part per 

00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:11.600
1000 difference. 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:20.633
So that means if I slice the
body there or there, on the 

00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:21.900
first slice-- 

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.467
remember, there's is a gradient
from foot to head-- 

00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:26.833
so there we have the average. 

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:30.100
63 MHz is going to be a signal
coming out from protons 

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.067
that are in that first slice. 

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.900
But in the second slice they're
going to be at 63.05, 

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.067
about a part per 1000, because
there's a higher 

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:40.767
field near the head. 

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:44.000
And if I did another slice
another inch or so along, it'd 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.367
be 63.1 MHz. 

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.900
So if I had an antenna and could
hear all these different 

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.933
frequencies and how strong the
signal was, I'd get a profile 

00:11:52.933 --> 00:11:56.500
of the proton distribution from
foot to head. 

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
So just like we did with the
X-rays scanning down. 

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.733
I now know how much water there
is at different places 

00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:06.300
along the height of the body, or
the length of the body. 

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.633
What did we want to do next? 

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:15.667
Matt? 

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:17.633
STUDENT: You do it in a
different direction-- 

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:19.267
PROFESSOR: So we want to make a
gradient 

00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:21.500
in a different direction, so I
stop the current in those 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.000
green coils and put on yellow
coils with current going that 

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.433
way, which adds to the big field
on the right. 

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:32.467
And then I put other coils over
here, which the current 

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:36.567
goes that way and subtracts from
the current from the 

00:12:36.567 --> 00:12:38.600
field on the left. 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.967
And when I do that, I get a
gradient from right to left. 

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:46.233
So then I can do a slice and
find out how water is 

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.200
oriented that way. 

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.100
And then I can put coils on the
top and bottom, analogous 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.433
to these, and get a vertical
gradient, and get it that way. 

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:56.000
And in fact, by putting a
certain amount of current in 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.700
all these coils at the same
time, different amounts in 

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.200
different coils, I can make a
slice that goes in any 

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.300
direction I want to, and find
out how much is there. 

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.533
So now in three dimensions I can
do one of these 

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:11.500
tomographic reconstructions, and
get where the 

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.467
water is in the body. 

00:13:14.467 --> 00:13:16.967
Now, much more interesting than
that, which is itself 

00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:21.733
very powerful, is functional
NMR, or MRI, magnetic 

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:23.000
resonance imaging. 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.300
Where you locate protons whose
signal strength is being 

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.000
fiddled with. 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.100
So for example, we talked about
relaxation, how fast the 

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.167
signal goes away. 

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:38.133
If you measured this for the
different signals you were 

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:41.067
getting, how fast they went
away, then you'd know 

00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:43.567
something about a difference
from one part of the body to 

00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:46.467
the other, that the protons in
this part, their signal is 

00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:49.767
going away rapidly, whereas here
they're not. 

00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:52.233
So you could get something about
how the protons are 

00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:56.067
behaving, not just what their
local field is. 

00:13:56.067 --> 00:14:01.500
So for example, blood oxygen
level dependent or B-O-L-D, 

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.333
BOLD imaging, you can do this. 

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.967
And you get a spatial resolution
of about one 

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:11.667
millimeter, and a temporal
resolution 

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.500
of about two seconds. 

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.900
So every two seconds, you can
get where oxygen is in the 

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.400
body, unusual amounts of oxygen,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.033
Now, how is that relevant? 

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:25.133
Because if you have cell
activity, it increases the 

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:30.200
blood oxygen supply, and that
speeds the relaxation, how 

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.100
fast the signal goes away. 

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.000
So now, these are very weak
signals. 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.567
So the way you tell something
about them, is to take a 

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.100
difference. 

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.167
Where did we see a difference
map before? 

00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:44.500
Do you remember? 

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.100
Remember when we look for 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.500
bonds in X-ray, we look at the
observed electron density 

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.067
minus what you'd have for the
atoms. That different signal, 

00:14:58.067 --> 00:15:00.400
tells you how it shifted for
bonds. 

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.133
Well, you do a similar kind of
thing here. 

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:03.633
You get a difference map. 

00:15:03.633 --> 00:15:04.700
Now, this is a bunch of
different 

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.200
slices through the brain. 

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.400
And what's lit up is where
there's relaxation. 

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.467
That is, where there's oxygen,
where the brain cells are 

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:19.800
active under one circumstance,
minus how active they are 

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.000
under some other circumstance. 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.800
It's a difference. 

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.300
So the brain is working harder
when it's in one 

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.267
state than the other. 

00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:30.800
Now, what are the two states? 

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:37.967
It's the subject being shown
donuts minus the signal when 

00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:41.233
the subject is being shown car
keys. 

00:15:41.233 --> 00:15:44.100
So these are places where the
brain lights up when it sees 

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.400
donuts, but doesn't light up
when it sees car keys. 

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.167
Now, this particular subject had
recently been fed. 

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:56.933
And they did it also for someone
who had not been fed, 

00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:58.533
who was fasting. 

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:00.600
And their brain really lit up
when they saw 

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.633
donuts versus car keys. 

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:06.400
So you can imagine that this is
very, very popular with 

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.033
psychologists and so on, people
interested in brain and 

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:12.067
all sorts of things, where you
can use this trick of 

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:14.633
differences to see where
something's happening in one 

00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:16.100
case versus another. 

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.667
So that's MRI, and, of course,
it's not fundamentally our 

00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:22.167
business here to talk about MRI.

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:26.467
Except, we want to see things
happening in molecules. 

00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:29.600
Now, why can't we do exactly the
same trick with molecules 

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.767
to find out where protons are in
a molecule? 

00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:36.867
How do we know that something is
here, rather than here, 

00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:39.433
rather than here in the brain? 

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.067
We establish a magnetic gradient
so that you get a 

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.233
different field here and here,
and you get different 

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:44.900
frequencies. 

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.733
And you can distinguish where it
is in the brain. 

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:50.033
What's the problem with doing
that for a molecule, and 

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:51.700
looking at different protons in
molecules? 

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:59.967
What's the difference between my
brain and a molecule? 

00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:02.767
There are lots of differences, 

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.600
but one of them is, that I hope
my brain is an awful lot 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.467
bigger than a molecule. 

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:12.933
So you can't establish a
gradient big enough across the 

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:16.100
small dimensions of a molecule,
so that protons in 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.567
different regions will have
different frequencies. 

00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:22.400
Within any one molecule it
should all be the same field 

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.367
for practical purposes. 

00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:28.900
So we can't do this trick, or
can we? 

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.200
So we want to locate protons
within molecules. 

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.833
And now we want to have, not a
gradient, we want to have a 

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:38.633
uniform field. 

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:41.267
If we could make the gradient
big enough, maybe that would 

00:17:41.267 --> 00:17:43.100
be useful, but we can't make it
big enough. 

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.833
So let's go the other direction
and make it 

00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:47.667
absolutely the same everywhere,
a uniform field. 

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:54.700
Now, and then what we're going
to do is listen until we hear--

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.433
and put up one of these pulses
in-- and hear the frequency 

00:17:58.433 --> 00:17:59.933
with which these protons-- 

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:02.567
if there are protons there in
the sample, we'll hear them. 

00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:04.767
Of course, most organic
substances 

00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:06.133
have protons in them. 

00:18:06.133 --> 00:18:09.267
So it doesn't surprise you that
as I scan 

00:18:09.267 --> 00:18:11.867
the magnetic field-- 

00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:14.967
increasing the magnetic field,
which changes the precession 

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:15.733
frequency-- 

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:19.000
while listening with a radio
that's tuned to just one 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.067
frequency, as I go along, at
someplace I'm going to have 

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.400
the right frequency. 

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.367
And the protons are going to
give me a signal. 

00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:29.267
Of course, if I had different
nuclei in there that were 

00:18:29.267 --> 00:18:31.867
different magnetic strengths,
then I'd get signals at 

00:18:31.867 --> 00:18:33.633
different places. 

00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:34.967
But I'm going to only look at--

00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:37.500
only listen for protons. 

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.667
OK, so there it is. 

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:39.033
Bingo! 

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:40.100
Protons. 

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.767
Whoop! 

00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:42.733
Protons again. 

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:44.233
Protons again. 

00:18:44.233 --> 00:18:46.633
There are different signals for
protons. 

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:50.233
Not all protons are equivalent.

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:53.433
Now, the difference here,
between this signal and this 

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.933
signal, and how big the magnetic
field is, is very, 

00:18:56.933 --> 00:18:57.833
very small. 

00:18:57.833 --> 00:19:00.400
It differs by only that
fraction, 

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.567
2.48 parts in a million. 

00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:07.100
They're almost exactly the same.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.300
But they're a little bit
different, just parts per 

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.300
million different. 

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.200
Now, when this was discovered it
was an annoyance for the 

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.433
physicists who were mostly
interested in things like 

00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:22.400
measuring how strong the
magnetic moment was, how fast 

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.467
the precession was for protons.

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:27.767
But they put something in there
that has protons and 

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.567
they find out there are
different protons. 

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:32.567
Which one is the real proton? 

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:36.533
So they called this the chemical
shift, because these 

00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:38.700
differences had something to do
with a chemical 

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.467
environment. 

00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:45.100
But this was a gold mine for
chemists, because since the 

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.700
beginning people have been-- 

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.167
since 1850, at least-- people
have been interested in 

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:51.500
chemical structure. 

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.533
But the only way they could do
it was convert one molecule to 

00:19:54.533 --> 00:19:55.933
another, count isomers-- 

00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:59.100
as we discussed last semester
with Koerner, and so on-- 

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.200
and try to use logic to figure
out what structure would be 

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.733
consistent for these various
transformations, chemical 

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:09.433
transformations. 

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:12.267
And, of course, then there was
X-ray, which really did show 

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:13.667
where atoms were. 

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:17.000
But here's something that could
work in liquids. 

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.467
Not everything can be a crystal.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.700
So this looked really, really
promising. 

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.900
Now, this sample was ethanol. 

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.567
Now, what do you think the three
different 

00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:27.667
signals are in ethanol? 

00:20:27.667 --> 00:20:30.733
Well, one must be the OH. 

00:20:30.733 --> 00:20:33.933
One must be the H's of the CH2,
and one must be the H's 

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.200
of the CH3. 

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:43.533
Now, doing such an experiment
requires that the field be 

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:47.900
very, very uniform, because if,
as you go from one part of 

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.133
your sample to another, the
field changes by a couple 

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:54.667
ppm, then the methyl protons in
this part of 

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:58.200
the sample will appear the same
place that the CH2 

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.600
protons appear in this part of
the sample, or the OH does in 

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.233
this part of the sample, even if
the gradient across the 

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:09.833
sample is only a part per
million or so, a couple parts 

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:11.100
per million. 

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.800
And that's one of the reasons
these peaks are not 

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.767
infinitely sharp. 

00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:17.133
One of the reasons they're broad
is that the field isn't 

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:18.633
perfectly uniform. 

00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:19.400
But it's very good. 

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.300
It's within a fraction of a part
per million. 

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.833
Now, in the late 1950s, as it
says here, chemistry 

00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:31.267
departments began buying
commercial NMR spectrometers. 

00:21:31.267 --> 00:21:34.000
This one was called the Varian
A-60, and it's the one I 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.233
learned to operate. 

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.133
And they had to have fields that
were homogeneous enough to 

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.700
determine molecular structure. 

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.100
So they had to have fields that
were different, that 

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.167
didn't vary by more than a small
part of a part per 

00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:52.400
million, so that you could tell
things about chemical 

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.533
shifts and spin-spin splittings,
which we're going 

00:21:54.533 --> 00:21:57.033
to be talking about in the rest
of this lecture. 

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:59.367
But, of course, these things
were expensive and many 

00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:03.000
different people were using
them, so it was a challenge to 

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.833
keep the field homogeneous to
obtain sharp lines. 

00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:08.533
Now, there were knobs in there
that you could turn the 

00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:12.267
current to coils, to cancel a
gradient in one direction or 

00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:14.500
another, or another, or another.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.467
And most of them were hidden
behind that door, and the door 

00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:21.433
said on it, Do Not Open. 

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:24.733
Because someone who knew what he
was doing came in at the 

00:22:24.733 --> 00:22:27.100
beginning of the day and turned
all those knobs just 

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.300
right, so the field was very
uniform. 

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.933
And if anybody else came in and
twiddled them, then the 

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:35.400
next guy to come in was really
up a creek. 

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.700
So do not touch these gradient
knobs. 

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.500
In fact, there was one there,
the y gradient, which would 

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.133
have its own special sign, Do
not touch this. 

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:51.833
Now, this was fine, but across
New Haven... or across the Long 

00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:55.100
Island Sound here, you see the
smokestacks of Port Jefferson 

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.433
and the medical building at
State University in New York 

00:22:58.433 --> 00:22:59.567
at Stony Brook. 

00:22:59.567 --> 00:23:02.400
And there was a physical chemist
at Stony Brook who 

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.533
fiddled with them. 

00:23:03.533 --> 00:23:05.667
His name was Paul Lauterbur. 

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:10.400
And in 1972 he would take over
this machine every night, and 

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.433
he'd just wreck the field
homogeneity. 

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:15.900
And, of course, late at night
before he left, or early 

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.567
morning, he would turn all the
knobs back, because he was 

00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:23.300
really an expert at NMR. But the
reason he did this was to 

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.300
establish gradients in different
directions so that 

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.833
he could locate-- 

00:23:27.833 --> 00:23:30.133
he had a sample tube, and he
filled it 

00:23:30.133 --> 00:23:32.767
with D20, not protons. 

00:23:32.767 --> 00:23:37.733
And in it he put two capillary
tubes that had water in them. 

00:23:37.733 --> 00:23:39.967
So he did exactly the kind of
experiment we 

00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:41.233
were talking about. 

00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:45.867
And in Nature in 1973, he
published this, where he 

00:23:45.867 --> 00:23:49.700
scanned vertically and got this,
scanned horizontally and 

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.600
got this, scanned at 45 degrees
or -45 degrees and got those,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.533
and could find out where these
water samples were inside D2O. 

00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:04.367
And he called that
zeugmatography, but the name 

00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:06.300
didn't catch on. 

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.333
But the good news was that 30
years later he got the Nobel 

00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:12.700
Prize in Physiology or Medicine,
for inventing MRI. 

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.800
And that's what he worked on the
rest of his life. 

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800
So it was a chemist who invented
MRI. 

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:27.767
So there are lots and lots of
magnetic resonance 

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:28.933
spectrometers. 

00:24:28.933 --> 00:24:32.500
And I already showed you some
X-ray diffractomers around, 

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.333
which have put classical
structure proof by chemical 

00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:38.000
transformation, the kind of
thing that we talked about 

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Koerner doing, 

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.733
and even IR, mostly out of
business, although there are 

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:45.733
still things for which IR is as
good or even better than 

00:24:45.733 --> 00:24:49.367
NMR. And, in fact, there was a
Yale-- 

00:24:49.367 --> 00:24:52.667
before I came here, there was a
organic chemistry professor 

00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:55.400
who was in the field called
natural products, where the 

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.833
job was to take something that
came from nature and figure 

00:24:57.833 --> 00:24:59.400
out what its structure was. 

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.867
And the way to do it, in those
days, was to do these chemical 

00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:05.800
transformations and try to make
it from something or make 

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.200
it into something whose
structure you knew. 

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.900
So these were great puzzles, and
it was 

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.400
really a big operation. 

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.567
But when NMR came along, he
abandoned organic chemistry 

00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:22.433
and took up fundamental research
on quantum theory. 

00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:25.267
And in fact, later he became a
professional studio 

00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:26.867
photographer. 

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:30.867
He was just wiped out by NMR
coming along, which is the way 

00:25:30.867 --> 00:25:32.633
people know structures now. 

00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:35.433
We haven't really talked about
that much, about how people 

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:37.500
knew-- we've talked about
different structures, but not 

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.133
really how people figured them
out, except 

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:41.867
when they used X-ray. 

00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:44.333
But this is an even more common
way of determining 

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:46.767
structures routinely, is
spectroscopy. 

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.167
And in particular, nowadays,
magnetic resonance 

00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:50.233
spectroscopy. 

00:25:50.233 --> 00:25:52.800
So a couple of years ago I took
a tour through the 

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.033
department and took photographs
of magnetic 

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:57.500
resonance spectrometers to show
you here. 

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.067
So across from your lab you may
have noticed this door 

00:26:00.067 --> 00:26:02.900
which says Chemical
Instrumentation Center, and it 

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.133
says warning over here, about
magnetic fields, so if you 

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.500
have a pacemaker, be careful. 

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.233
And you go inside there, and
some of these have now been 

00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:13.200
moved since I took the pictures,
but you see these 

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.800
things sticking up like here,
and here. 

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.533
And if you go around, you see
these big cans, WARNING: 

00:26:21.533 --> 00:26:22.833
strong magnetic field. 

00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:23.867
Here's another one. 

00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:24.667
Here's another one. 

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:27.000
That's a 500 MHz spectrometer. 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.833
Here's a 500 MHz spectrometer. 

00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:31.200
Here's a 600 MHz spectrometer. 

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.767
Here's another 600 MHz
spectrometer. 

00:26:33.767 --> 00:26:36.833
And out in the courtyard, behind
your lab, there's this 

00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:41.767
special little building that was
constructed specially for 

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:43.200
a big magnet. 

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.600
And it has this one, which is an
800 MHz spectrometer, 

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.700
which turns out to be 8 to the
third power. 

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.633
That is 512 times as sensitive
as a 100 MHz 

00:26:54.633 --> 00:26:58.033
spectrometer, not to mention
other advantages that we're 

00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.900
going to talk about below. 

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.933
Now, why is it 8 cubed? 

00:27:02.933 --> 00:27:05.067
It's because of the Boltzmann
factor. 

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:07.500
Remember, this signal comes
because there are more that 

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500
point with the field than
against the field. 

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.533
We only see the difference
between those two. 

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:14.700
And if you have a bigger energy
difference, you'll get 

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.233
a bigger population difference.

00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:18.800
So you get an eightfold factor
from that. 

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.600
But the energy quantum that
you're dealing with, in going 

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.533
from one level to another,
becomes eight times as big. 

00:27:24.533 --> 00:27:28.100
That's an advantage in your
signal. 

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.533
And the sensitivity of the
electronics, when it's eight 

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:32.967
times bigger, is also better. 

00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:36.167
So all these things go together
to make it 500 times 

00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:40.133
better, and even more than 500
times better when you consider 

00:27:40.133 --> 00:27:42.733
what we'll talk about soon, the
chemical shift advantage. 

00:27:42.733 --> 00:27:45.467
So that's why one pays the big
bucks to have a 

00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:46.933
machine like that. 

00:27:46.933 --> 00:27:49.433
Here are just some others that I
took around. 

00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:54.267
And now by the cross hall there,
next to your lab when you 

00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:57.667
walk down there on this side of
it, there's a room that has 

00:27:57.667 --> 00:28:00.700
electron paramagnetic resonance
spectrometers. 

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.467
So this is a much smaller
magnet, not one of these big 

00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:05.267
liquid helium cooled things. 

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:09.900
And the reason is that this is
to study free radicals, which 

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.233
have magnetic electrons. 

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:17.500
Mostly electrons come in pairs
and their magnetisms cancel. 

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.200
But in certain molecules, free
radicals, there's an odd 

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.233
electron, whose magnetism is
detectable. 

00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:26.267
So this is to study free
radicals. 

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:30.133
And the electron magnet is 660
times 

00:28:30.133 --> 00:28:32.300
stronger than the proton. 

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.567
So you don't need such a big
field to make it precess. 

00:28:36.567 --> 00:28:42.667
So you can use just 0.3 Tesla
instead of several Tesla for 

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:44.467
electron paramagnetic resonance.

00:28:44.467 --> 00:28:46.400
So there are two of those
spectrometers. 

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.867
And in fact, we don't have one
of these, but there's now 

00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:52.600
commercially available a 1000
MHz spectrometer, which 

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.733
is 23.5 Tesla. 

00:28:56.733 --> 00:29:01.833
And at the Florida State
University National High Field 

00:29:01.833 --> 00:29:04.333
Magnet Lab, there's a field
that's pulsed 

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:06.500
that goes to 45 Tesla. 

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.300
And it's a national lab. 

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.400
You don't pay to use it. 

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.833
But you have to have a great
experiment to be assigned time 

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.867
to do things there. 

00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:16.233
So there are lots of these
things around. 

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:18.900
Now let's go back and see why
it's so good. 

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.500
OK, we have these three signals,
and as we said, we're 

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.033
interested in which peak is
which set of protons. 

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:27.300
Now, how do we know which is
which? 

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.667
Can anybody see a way of
figuring out which is the CH3, 

00:29:30.667 --> 00:29:32.467
which is the CH2, and which is
the OH? 

00:29:36.433 --> 00:29:37.600
Any guesses? 

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:37.800
Yeah. 

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.633
STUDENT: The size of the peaks.

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:41.033
PROFESSOR: Ah! 

00:29:41.033 --> 00:29:44.367
If you have twice as many
protons, there should be twice 

00:29:44.367 --> 00:29:46.267
as strong a signal. 

00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:49.500
You measure the strength of the
signal by how much area is 

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.200
under it, by integrating it. 

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.133
So if we measure the integrals,
we see they're in 

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:59.467
the ratio of 1:2:3, so it's
clear that that's the 1, 

00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:02.000
that's the 2, and that's the 3.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.467
Now, we couldn't do this in IR,
because we had these 

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:07.733
normal modes, 

00:30:07.733 --> 00:30:10.133
an had for example, C=O. 

00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:12.567
And remember, as the C=O
vibrated, something else 

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:15.133
vibrated at the same time, and
other things, and they could 

00:30:15.133 --> 00:30:17.000
cancel or reinforce. 

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.300
So the signal intensities were
very, very different for 

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.200
different groups. 

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.000
But here the protons are all
essentially exactly the same. 

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.033
They differ only by a part per
million, or a few parts per 

00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:33.900
million, so the intensities are
proportional to the number 

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.233
of protons, because the
difference is so subtle. 

00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:43.967
So you can count protons by the
area under these peaks. 

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:44.767
That's what it says here. 

00:30:44.767 --> 00:30:47.400
The number is proportional to
the number protons because 

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.767
they're so similar, not like IR
peaks. 

00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.000
Now, how can you use this? 

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.300
Here was one of the very first
uses of a subtle organic 

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.533
chemistry question. 

00:30:57.533 --> 00:31:00.667
This was an advertisement by the
Varian Corporation in 

00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:04.333
1955, who were trying to sell
those machines I showed you, 

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.667
that the guy over at-- 

00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:09.133
Paul Lauterbur messed up the
field on every night. 

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:12.433
So this was 20, the use of
integrated 

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:14.767
intensities in structural
analysis. 

00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:19.167
So there's a question of the
structure of C7H8, whether 

00:31:19.167 --> 00:31:20.633
it's this or this. 

00:31:20.633 --> 00:31:23.367
And notice that those two are
related to one another, 

00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:26.200
because if we shifted the
electrons like that, one would 

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.467
go to the other. 

00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:30.567
So you could imagine them going
back and forth by an 

00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:31.700
electrocyclic reaction. 

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.533
And the question is, which is it
really? 

00:31:34.533 --> 00:31:36.967
Well, you could try to figure
out by chemical 

00:31:36.967 --> 00:31:40.200
transformation, and people did
that. 

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.667
So which is it? 

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:44.867
Well, let's try ozonolysis. 

00:31:44.867 --> 00:31:47.267
Now, do you remember what
happens with ozonolysis and 

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:49.067
then oxidation? 

00:31:49.067 --> 00:31:52.967
You cleave C=C double bonds and
make carbonyl groups there, an 

00:31:52.967 --> 00:31:59.200
acid, make a carboxylic acid
group when you add the H2O2. 

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.933
So these would give different
products. 

00:32:01.933 --> 00:32:05.567
Notice that on the left, you
would cleave three bonds, on 

00:32:05.567 --> 00:32:08.667
the right, you'd cleave only two
double bonds. 

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:13.300
So on the left, you would get
that diacid. On the right, 

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.833
you'd get the diacid that has
two more carbons. 

00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:20.567
Now, in fact, that acid on the
right was known. 

00:32:20.567 --> 00:32:24.500
It's called cis-caronic acid,
and that's what you got. 

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.600
So what's the conclusion? 

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.600
The conclusion is that the
structure must be B, not A. So 

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.367
that's a classical structure
proof by chemical 

00:32:33.367 --> 00:32:34.600
transformation. 

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:38.800
But here's a completely
different way 

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.700
of going about it. 

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.500
Take the NMR spectrum and count
the protons. 

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.500
So the group on the left there
are protons that are attached 

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.833
to double bonded carbons, and on
the right, to 

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:53.933
single bonded carbons. 

00:32:53.933 --> 00:32:57.600
And now, notice that the
compound B has 

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.267
four of each kind. 

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:05.300
But compound A has six of one
kind and two of the other. 

00:33:07.933 --> 00:33:10.600
And if you integrate, you find
that those 

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.667
ratios are 2.9:1, 3:1. 

00:33:14.667 --> 00:33:17.267
So which is it? 

00:33:17.267 --> 00:33:20.400
It must be A that you're taking
the spectrum of. 

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.967
That's the one that's 3:1. 

00:33:27.967 --> 00:33:31.900
So it must be that that's the
structure, but then how do you 

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.433
explain this misleading chemical
transformation? 

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:40.000
It must be that there's an
equilibrium between these two 

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.367
things that lies to the left, so
when you take the spectrum 

00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:47.500
that's the stuff you see, that's
most of the material. 

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.000
But it's not as reactive with
ozone as the 

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.167
stuff on the right. 

00:33:52.167 --> 00:33:54.733
So that little bit of stuff on
the right is what reacts with 

00:33:54.733 --> 00:33:56.467
ozone and gives the product. 

00:33:56.467 --> 00:34:00.567
So the chemical transformation
was misleading. 

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:04.667
And this is the kind of thing
that made this Yale natural 

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:07.433
products organic chemistry
professor pull out his hair 

00:34:07.433 --> 00:34:09.633
and become a quantum chemist,
and then a studio 

00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:11.867
photographer, that you couldn't
do what he was 

00:34:11.867 --> 00:34:15.000
trained to do anymore. 

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.967
So spectroscopy took over in
determining structure, and 

00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:21.833
we're going to talk a little bit
about how you do this. 

00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:27.933
Now, Chemistry 220 website has a
bunch of NMR problems. 

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:34.067
There are 40 problems there, and
I took this from one of 

00:34:34.067 --> 00:34:36.167
them and fiddled with it a
little bit. 

00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:40.933
And in fact, let me just see, I
think I left an extra-- 

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.633
well, I'll go through here and--

00:34:42.633 --> 00:34:45.000
there's going to be an extra
slide in here. 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.033
So we can integrate. 

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:49.533
And see that there are 2 and 3,
and 3. 

00:34:49.533 --> 00:34:55.033
So we know that the 2 must be
that CH2, but there are two 

00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:59.200
CH3 groups, one is one and one
is the other. 

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.500
That's at low resolution, where
the 

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.300
field isn't so uniform. 

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.100
But if you make the field
really, really uniform, if you 

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.333
tweak those knobs just right, so
that the peaks don't get 

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:12.100
broadened by having different
fields in different parts of 

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:17.567
the sample, and in fact, spin
the sample, so that a given 

00:35:17.567 --> 00:35:20.833
molecule actually is going
around and sampling different 

00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:25.300
parts to average the field, to
make it even more uniform, 

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.433
then you see this thing with
sharp peaks. 

00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:31.500
So it's the same 3, 3, 2, but
they look a 

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.733
little different here. 

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.567
So the peak width is about three
parts per billion, and 

00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:44.767
that's just, as you see, a
single peak there. 

00:35:44.767 --> 00:35:47.967
But this next one is a little
different. 

00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:49.800
That's a triplet, 1:2:1. 

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.833
So that's one of those CH3
groups, but which CH3 group? 

00:35:57.833 --> 00:35:59.967
Oh, pardon me, I got it
backwards. 

00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:04.533
This was a CH3 group, and it
turns out to be this one. 

00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:07.867
This CH3 group is split into
three, and it's that one. 

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:10.067
Now, why is it not a single
peak? 

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:13.233
What's different? 

00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:18.100
OK, well, that splitting is
0.029 parts per million. 

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.600
I obviously blew it up in order
to be able to see it 

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.700
clearly here. 

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.667
And this is a 250 MHz spectrum.

00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:27.533
So it means that splitting, the
difference in frequency, 

00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:32.967
of protons in one environment or
the other, is 7.3 Hz. 

00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:38.167
And it's exactly the same there,
7.3 Hz. 

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:42.833
Now, if you look here, that's a
quartet. 

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:45.433
And those are 7.3 Hz as well. 

00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:51.633
Now, what's that last signal,
this little 

00:36:51.633 --> 00:36:53.300
tiny one down here? 

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.533
Well, notice that the solvent is
CDCl3. 

00:36:57.533 --> 00:37:00.600
Now, why would they pay the
bucks, the big bucks, to get 

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.533
deuterium rather than just using
normal chloroform, 

00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:05.233
CHCl3, for a solvent. 

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.433
What would it look like if the
solvent were CHCl3? 

00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:16.233
You'd have an enormous peak from
the solvent, that 

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:18.200
hydrogen of the solvent. 

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.233
It would wash out the other
things. 

00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:22.233
So you make it deuterium. 

00:37:22.233 --> 00:37:24.233
But it's not 100% deuterium. 

00:37:24.233 --> 00:37:27.500
There's a tiny, tiny amount of
protium in there. 

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.633
So that tiny signal comes from a
little bit 

00:37:29.633 --> 00:37:33.533
of CH3 [correction:CHCI3] in the
solvent. 

00:37:33.533 --> 00:37:37.967
So the 90 degree pulse makes the
spinning nuclei broadcast 

00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:42.000
a frequency that tells their
local magnetic field, in a 

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.900
uniform field. 

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.533
Now, there's the big uniform
field. 

00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:51.067
But what the nucleus sees is an
effective local magnetic 

00:37:51.067 --> 00:37:53.933
field, which is, of course, the
big field-- that's mostly 

00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:57.433
it-- but little, little tiny
differences due to the 

00:37:57.433 --> 00:37:58.733
chemical environment. 

00:37:58.733 --> 00:38:01.433
And let's see how we do it. 

00:38:01.433 --> 00:38:05.800
OK, just to back up at first,
you could make the applied 

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.800
field inhomogeneous, as an MRI.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:15.200
And then the field can be, for
example, 2 Tesla, 30,000 

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.667
Gauss, with a gradient of 4
Gauss per 

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:19.367
centimeter for human samples. 

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:20.767
And if you have a tiny thing,
you could 

00:38:20.767 --> 00:38:21.733
make a bigger gradient. 

00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:25.000
So for small animals you can get
50 Gauss per centimeter 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.700
and do the imaging that we
talked about. 

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.533
But in chemistry it's different.

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:31.700
In chemistry, you make it really
homogeneous, so the 

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.000
only differences come not from
where the proton is in the 

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.167
sample, but from where it is in
a molecule. 

00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:43.267
And now we're interested in a
molecular field that's added 

00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:46.633
to or subtracted from the big
field. 

00:38:46.633 --> 00:38:49.733
And mostly it's subtracted from,
as you'll see. 

00:38:49.733 --> 00:38:53.033
So these molecular fields then
tell you about the molecular 

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:56.033
environment, these tiny shifts.

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:59.467
So there are two sources of
these local magnetic fields, 

00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:02.733
besides the enormous big field
that you put on. 

00:39:02.733 --> 00:39:06.167
One is electrons orbiting. 

00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:09.400
Now, the electrons come in pairs
that tend to orbit in 

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.200
opposite directions, so they
tend to cancel. 

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.133
But there's a little bit of
excess, for reasons we don't 

00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:19.367
need to go on to, of one
orbiting over the other. 

00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:22.500
So you get effects from electron
orbiting. 

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.867
And the magnitude of this shift
is about 12 parts per 

00:39:27.867 --> 00:39:33.400
million for protons, or 200 ppm
for carbon, 

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.433
the range of values you can get
from that. 

00:39:37.433 --> 00:39:39.433
Which is-- so this is grossly
exaggerated. 

00:39:39.433 --> 00:39:42.800
It should be only parts per
million of this, not, you 

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.833
know, like a 20th or something
like that, or a 10th. 

00:39:47.833 --> 00:39:50.367
OK, so one thing about the
environment is how many 

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:53.733
electrons are around doing this
orbiting? 

00:39:53.733 --> 00:39:57.800
The other thing is there are
other magnetic nuclei nearby 

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.467
who have fields, too. 

00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:02.733
So if you're this proton, or
listening for this proton, its 

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:06.000
field is not only going to be
the big field, not only what's 

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.833
coming from the electrons
orbiting, but also what's 

00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:12.233
coming from other nuclei that
are in the vicinity, being 

00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:15.100
oriented either this way or this
way. 

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.567
OK, and those we measure in Hz,
and you'll see why we 

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:22.500
measure one in ppm, and the
other in 

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.500
Hz very soon. 

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.833
So anyhow, when you add all
those things together, you get 

00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:29.367
an effective field. 

00:40:29.367 --> 00:40:31.833
And that's what determines the
frequency of the signal you're 

00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:34.467
going to hear. 

00:40:34.467 --> 00:40:36.900
So first we're going to talk
about the chemical shift, what 

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.033
happens from orbiting. 

00:40:40.033 --> 00:40:44.767
So electron orbiting gives this
little red B, but the 

00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:49.667
reason the electrons orbit is
because of the applied field. 

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:52.000
And the bigger the applied
field, 

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.033
the bigger the orbiting. 

00:40:55.033 --> 00:40:56.833
So that says the red field is 

00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:58.667
proportional to the blue field.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:02.400
If you spent the money to get a
bigger magnet, you'd get 

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.433
twice as much orbiting, so the
red would be twice as big. 

00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:11.033
So that says that what you
measure then is a fractional 

00:41:11.033 --> 00:41:13.200
thing, because it's not a
standard difference. 

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.400
It depends on how big your
magnet is. 

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.200
If you make your magnet twice as
big, the shift is twice as 

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.400
big, the red field is twice as
big. 

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.567
So it's a fraction of the big
one. 

00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:28.533
So you measure it in parts per
million, in a fractional unit 

00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:31.633
rather than in an absolute unit,
like an energy unit, 

00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:33.367
like Hz. 

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:35.833
OK, so here's a scale of parts
per million. 

00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:39.267
Let's see what different values
we have. Now, the 

00:41:39.267 --> 00:41:44.767
standard that's used it's called
TMS, tetramethylsilane. 

00:41:44.767 --> 00:41:48.200
Now, why use such a weird
molecule as your standard? 

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.667
Well, it's a small molecule and
it's volatile. 

00:41:52.667 --> 00:41:57.000
So you can add a drop to your
sample, but you can easily get 

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.433
it out again if you want to
recover your sample, because 

00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:02.900
it evaporates easily. 

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.767
Now, it has four CH3 groups, but
they're all identically 

00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:11.933
situated, so it will just give
one peak rather than a more 

00:42:11.933 --> 00:42:14.200
complicated molecule, so that's
good. 

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.967
But the thing that's really
special is that the silicon 

00:42:17.967 --> 00:42:21.967
is, being a metal, is partially
plus, and the methyl 

00:42:21.967 --> 00:42:25.533
is largely minus, which means
there are more electrons 

00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:28.300
around the protons, which means

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.967
there's a bigger shielding. 

00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:32.433
This B is bigger than it would
be if there were fewer 

00:42:32.433 --> 00:42:33.633
electrons around. 

00:42:33.633 --> 00:42:36.567
So it shifted all the way to one
end of the spectrum, so it 

00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:38.733
doesn't overlap other things
that you might 

00:42:38.733 --> 00:42:40.267
have in your sample. 

00:42:40.267 --> 00:42:45.000
So you have a standard, then,
that you can use with high 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.800
electron density around the
protons, which defines 0. 

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.067
And now, you get another peak
from your sample, and see 

00:42:53.067 --> 00:42:55.100
where it is compared to this. 

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.133
For example, if you have a
carboxylic acid, the H on a 

00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:03.967
carboxylic acid is way what's
called downfield. 

00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:04.433
Why? 

00:43:04.433 --> 00:43:08.967
Why is it very different from
the hydrogen in TMS? 

00:43:08.967 --> 00:43:13.600
Anybody see why the COOH
hydrogen might be different? 

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.867
The environment of it? 

00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:21.100
The OH is electron withdrawing,
especially with the carbonyl 

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.133
group on it. 

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:26.333
So the electrons get sucked away
from the hydrogen. 

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:31.733
You don't have as much of that
red shielding effect, so it's 

00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:33.700
shifted way down to the
other end.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.700
So on the right, it's said to
be shielded.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.433
That is, the electrons around
the proton cancel the big 

00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:45.733
field, but only a teeny bit of
it, only a 

00:43:45.733 --> 00:43:47.000
few parts per million. 

00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:54.433
And it's called upfield, and
it's also a place where 

00:43:54.433 --> 00:43:56.833
there's high electron density. 

00:43:56.833 --> 00:43:59.667
And it's called a low chemical
shift. 

00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:03.300
This scale is the chemical shift
numbers, and that's 

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.933
defined as zero, so it's a very
low number. 

00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:11.400
And it's also low frequency,
because we have lots of 

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.900
electrons relatively big value
here. 

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.000
There is very small, relatively
small, magnet 

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.400
effective field, relatively
small. 

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.700
So a low precession frequency,
not such a big field. 

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.600
By contrast, the OH is called
deshielded, downfield, low 

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.300
electron density, high chemical

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.967
shift, and high frequency. 

00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:37.600
Now, if you have a proton that's
attached to a normal 

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.300
carbon, not one that's attached
to silicon, which is 

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.533
giving electrons away, then it
comes around 1, or 

00:44:44.533 --> 00:44:46.800
between 1/2 and 2. 

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.533
And these were found just by
putting different known 

00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:53.800
samples in and seeing where the
peaks came. 

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.533
But if you have oxygen, halogen,
or nitrogen attached 

00:44:57.533 --> 00:45:02.000
to the carbon, in the same way
that silicon donated electrons 

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.767
to carbon, these electronegative
atoms take 

00:45:04.767 --> 00:45:07.667
electrons from the carbon, which
take electrons from the 

00:45:07.667 --> 00:45:10.967
hydrogen, which make B smaller,

00:45:10.967 --> 00:45:12.400
which shift it downfield. 

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.767
So in that region, between 2.5
and 4.5. 

00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:22.400
If the carbon, to which the
hydrogen is attached, is 

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.100
itself attached to a carbon, not
to one of these 

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.300
electronegative elements, but
that carbon has oxygen on it, 

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.367
then the oxygen is sucking
electrons from carbon, from 

00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:35.900
carbon, from hydrogen, so it's
shifted down a little bit. 

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.367
So a hydrogen on a carbon
attached to a carbonyl is in 

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:42.067
between there. 

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:44.833
If you have a carbon attached to
a double bond, it's shifted 

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:46.133
down still further. 

00:45:46.133 --> 00:45:50.433
Now, why should a hydrogen
attached to a double bond be 

00:45:50.433 --> 00:45:54.133
different from a carbon with a
double bond, be different from 

00:45:54.133 --> 00:45:58.767
a hydrogen attached to a carbon
with only single bonds? 

00:45:58.767 --> 00:46:00.167
What difference? Mimi? 

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.233
STUDENT: The pi bond? 

00:46:02.233 --> 00:46:03.000
PROFESSOR: It's not the-- 

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.200
well, actually, to tell you the
truth, it probably is the 

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.300
pi bond, but that's not the
explanation that people 

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300
usually give. 

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.100
What other difference? 

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.067
What difference is there in the
sigma system? 

00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:14.567
Lauren? 

00:46:14.567 --> 00:46:16.067
STUDENT: Hybridization? 

00:46:16.067 --> 00:46:16.933
PROFESSOR: Pardon me. 

00:46:16.933 --> 00:46:17.367
STUDENT: Hybridization. 

00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:18.833
PROFESSOR: The hybridization,
right? 

00:46:18.833 --> 00:46:23.967
This is an sp squared, more s,
more electron withdrawing. 

00:46:23.967 --> 00:46:27.700
Whereas these carbons are
sp cubed, so as you pull

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.200
electrons to the carbon, away
from the 

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.833
hydrogen, you shift down. 

00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:32.100
That makes sense. 

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.200
In fact, this, you might expect,
would be the same. 

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.600
It's shifted even a little
further down. 

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.467
All these things were discovered
empirically, just 

00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:42.300
by putting known samples in and
finding 

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.967
out where they come. 

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:46.867
And then an aldehyde is, you
won't be surprised to hear, is 

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:49.233
still further down, because it
has the oxygen-- it's not only

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:51.467
double bonded, it has an
oxygen pulling away.

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:54.833
So all these things more or less
make sense, in terms of 

00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:58.300
electron withdrawal, or donation
to the hydrogen. 

00:47:01.267 --> 00:47:03.500
But in fact, it's a little more
subtle than that. 

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:09.300
Now ROH is funny, because it can
come at lots of different 

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.533
positions, depending on
concentration, and depending 

00:47:13.533 --> 00:47:14.733
on temperature. 

00:47:14.733 --> 00:47:17.267
Why would concentration have
anything to do with it? 

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:19.100
Why would it have come at a
different place if 

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.433
you had more ROH? 

00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:21.733
Lauren? 

00:47:21.733 --> 00:47:25.900
STUDENT: The hydrogen bonding
between molecules. 

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.567
PROFESSOR: If you have hydrogen
bonding 

00:47:27.567 --> 00:47:29.433
and that affects the chemical
shift, the higher 

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.700
concentration, more hydrogen
bonding, higher temperature, 

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.533
less hydrogen bonding. 

00:47:35.533 --> 00:47:39.200
So OH comes at lots of different
positions depending 

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.300
on those factors. 

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.700
But you can already see from
this, that if you take a 

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.100
spectrum and see peaks in
different positions, you can 

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.367
try to say, aha! 

00:47:48.367 --> 00:47:51.700
This looks like it has hydrogens
that are just 

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.567
attached to carbons that are all
single bonded. 

00:47:53.567 --> 00:47:56.733
It has hydrogens on double
bonded carbons, blah, blah. 

00:47:56.733 --> 00:47:59.300
You measure the integral and see
how many of each kind 

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:04.600
there are, and you can then do
puzzles, like the ones in that 

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.333
web page that I mentioned, to
try to figure out what 

00:48:08.333 --> 00:48:09.833
structures are. 

00:48:09.833 --> 00:48:12.733
Now, let's see if you've learned
from this. 

00:48:12.733 --> 00:48:15.567
Where should you expect the
hydrogen that is attached to 

00:48:15.567 --> 00:48:17.600
the carbon of an acetylene? 

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.967
Where would you expect it to
come? 

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.200
What's special? 

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.967
Noelle, you got any idea on
this? 

00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:27.900
What's special about it? 

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.767
STUDENT: The triple bond. 

00:48:28.767 --> 00:48:29.000
PROFESSOR: Can't hear. 

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.467
STUDENT: The triple bond. 

00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:31.133
PROFESSOR: The triple bond. 

00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:33.700
So now, how is the triple bond
going to affect things? 

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.533
STUDENT: Hybridization. 

00:48:36.533 --> 00:48:37.467
PROFESSOR: It will affect the 

00:48:37.467 --> 00:48:39.300
hybridization, in what way? 

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.600
STUDENT: Will it be deshielding?

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.633
PROFESSOR: It'll be sp. 

00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:47.500
It'll be an sp hybrid, which is
more electron withdrawing, 

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.367
than sp squared, than
sp cubed.

00:48:50.367 --> 00:48:54.633
So it should be pulling
electrons away, deshielding, 

00:48:54.633 --> 00:48:57.567
as you say, because the
electrons are shielding, so it 

00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:00.600
should shift to the left,
compared to the double bond 

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.900
ones, right? 

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.567
Wrong. 

00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:07.967
It actually comes up there. 

00:49:07.967 --> 00:49:10.633
So there's more to it than what
we're saying. 

00:49:10.633 --> 00:49:13.467
Now, what is this more to it? 

00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:16.867
Unfortunately, the clock has
run, so you're going to have 

00:49:16.867 --> 00:49:19.567
to wait for tomorrow to find
that out.

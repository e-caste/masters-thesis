00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.813
Prof: Well today we're
going to talk about evolutionary

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:05.400
medicine.
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.573
And there are some resources
that you can use,

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:10.830
if you get interested in this.
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.180
There's a book,
got twenty-three chapters in

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.570
it.
 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.072
There is a website called
Evo-Med Symposia,

00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:22.076
that you can go to,
and you can have talks on the

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:25.328
evolution of HIV,
antibiotic resistance,

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:30.226
etcetera;
and that's in Streaming Digital

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:31.050
video.
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.890
So each one of those talks
lasts about an hour.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.206
So if you get interested in any
of that, you can actually

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:39.275
see--and by the way,
it's not just the PowerPoints,

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:40.930
you see the people giving the
talks.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.625
So if you want to actually more
or less meet these people and

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:47.828
see what they're like,
that's a place that you can do

00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:48.260
it.
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.787
Now the range of issues in
evolutionary medicine is really

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:53.900
quite large.
 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.044
And I often get asked--you
know, people haven't heard the

00:00:57.044 --> 00:01:00.469
term before, they don't know
what evolutionary medicine is.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.390
So here is a description.
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.369
Okay?
 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.528
Part of it is that we contain
traces of our evolutionary

00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:11.837
history and they bias our
responses in significant medical

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:12.670
issues.
 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.721
So there's the hygiene
hypothesis about autoimmune

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:17.549
disease.
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.590
There is our genetic variation
for resistance and drug

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.430
response.
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.110
There are traces of the
selection that illnesses,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.400
that diseases,
have written on our genome.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.190
Then there are issues in
reproductive medicine.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.000
And the human life history is
really quite special.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.290
If you contrast us to
chimpanzees or bonobos,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.821
human females are capable of
pumping out children about twice

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:51.068
as fast as a female chimpanzee,
and the only way they can do it

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:52.709
is by having help.
 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.795
So it indicates that we have
been highly social for a long

00:01:56.795 --> 00:02:00.450
time, and our life history has
responded to that.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.462
You know something about
genetic conflicts,

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:05.194
imprinting and mental disease,
because I talked about that

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:05.769
earlier.
 

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:09.715
Then there are the issues of
ovacytic atresia and selective

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:13.456
abortions and mate choice,
which are an interesting part

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:15.430
of reproductive medicine.
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.121
A big part of evolutionary
medicine has to do with the

00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:21.560
evolution and ecology of
disease.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.330
And diseases have adaptive
strategies.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.370
They have their own agendas.
 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.811
They have, many of them,
have developed ways of avoiding

00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:34.690
our immune responses,
of manipulating hosts.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.799
Some of them manipulate us;
that's what coughing and

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.240
sneezing is about.
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.918
That's also what making us
extremely tired and lying down

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:45.840
is about, in malaria.
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.139
Their virulence evolves,
they evolve drug resistance

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.830
rapidly, and those are very
significant medical issues.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.194
Then there's all the
information that's coming in now

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:59.949
from evolutionary genetics and
genomics about where viruses

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:00.919
originated.
 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.667
So, for example,
the detective work necessary to

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.812
determine that the sooty
mangabey was the ancestor of

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:12.639
HIV-2 is done with molecular
phylogenetics,

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.470
and that the chimpanzee is the
ancestor of HIV-1;

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.752
that the SIV living in the
chimpanzee is the ancestor of

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:22.699
HIV-1 is done that way.
 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.550
Then there are very significant
differences between different

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.927
kinds of bacteria,
in terms of their genetics and

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:31.512
their population biology,
particularly in how readily

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:34.810
they can do horizontal gene
transfer.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.139
So that if a bacterium in one
species evolves resistance to a

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.304
certain drug,
how likely is it that that

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:43.080
resistance gene will get into
another species?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.372
Okay?
 

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:46.772
That's obviously a critical
question, and it depends on the

00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:50.232
particular kind of evolutionary
genetics that that bacterium

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:52.530
has;
and they vary in this respect.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.449
Okay?
 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.166
And then there are all of the
issues about under what

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:59.740
conditions do new diseases
emerge?

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.408
And that itself is quite a
growing field.

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:08.530
Then there's all about the
degenerative diseases.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.878
Okay? How did aging evolve?
 

00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:13.882
And given that we have an
evolutionary theory of aging,

00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:16.997
what can we expect to be the
characteristics of the aging

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:17.720
organism?
 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.480
Are they going to be simple or
complex;

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750
and if we fix one thing,
will another thing break?

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.319
That kind of issue.
 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.600
We can view cancer as an
evolutionary process.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.180
Every cancer is its own little
microevolutionary process.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.312
A population of cancer cells is
a genetically heterogeneous ball

00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:38.940
of growing cells;
that has important implications.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.863
And then there are links here
in degenerative disease--in

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:45.877
heart disease,
obesity and diabetes--back to

00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:48.610
traces of our evolutionary
history.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.250
So that's the scale of the
issues.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.654
If we think about the--oh let
me just run through that

00:04:55.654 --> 00:05:00.031
quickly--
if we think about traces of our

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.670
history,
we usually think about

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.889
hunter-gatherers and the kinds
of groups that they lived in.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.038
If we think about the
evolutionary biology of

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:14.689
diseases, we think about things
like Ebola and HIV and malaria.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.940
And if we think about
degenerative diseases,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.209
we think about this process.
 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:22.939
So that's what evolutionary
medicine is about;

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.939
it's about a lot of different
stuff.

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:25.790
Okay?
 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.079
So I can't talk about all of
that.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.884
I've just described the course
that I gave last fall in

00:05:31.884 --> 00:05:32.560
Copenhagen.
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.990
Okay?
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.129
It took two months.
 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.470
&gt;
 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.959
So I could give you some
important classical themes.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.120
I could give you some
surprising new insights.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.076
I could give you some
overarching general messages,

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.267
such as our bodies are
compromises that impose indirect

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:51.660
costs;
or that evolution takes time;

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.360
or pathogens have their own
agendas.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.079
I could present research,
stuff I've worked on myself.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.684
I've done a fair amount on the
evolution of aging,

00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:02.447
and I'm currently working on
how natural selection is

00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:05.000
operating in contemporary human
populations.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.052
Or I could give you messages
primarily aimed right at

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:13.033
practicing doctors;
so practical applications in

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:15.209
clinic and public health.
 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.603
And this is what I chose:
I chose Mismatches to

00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:19.490
Modernity.
 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.322
So I'm going to talk a little
about thrifty phenotypes,

00:06:22.322 --> 00:06:24.370
and parasites and autoimmune
disease;

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.547
and then I'm going to talk
about how pathogens have their

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.420
own agendas and evolve rapidly.
 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.620
Okay?
 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.790
So I hope you've got the
picture.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.853
This is a small portion of the
subject matter of evolutionary

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:36.600
medicine.
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.389
But these are arguably
important themes.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.759
So the point about thrifty
phenotypes is this:

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.519
Early life events are failing
to predict late life

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.170
environments.
 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.319
Perhaps they used to be good
predictors,

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.341
or perhaps those early life
events were correlated well with

00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:58.290
the environment in the
Pleistocene,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.189
for ten or fifteen years,
something like that.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:07.166
What we do know is this:
if you nutritionally stress a

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:10.750
mother and infant,
the fetuses and infants will

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.011
have increased risk of obesity,
diabetes and cardiovascular

00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:18.160
disease fifty or sixty years
later.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.324
And the initial data that
demonstrated this came from the

00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:23.959
Dutch Hungry Winter.
 

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:27.384
The idea is that stress early
in life is switching the

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:30.742
individual into a physiology
that's very effective at

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.754
conserving energy,
but it is inappropriate if

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.279
there's an adequate diet.
 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:38.360
So the muscle cells become
insulin resistant,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.509
fat becomes concentrated in
special depots.

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:45.829
And we now have a lot of data
indicating that this is the case

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:46.680
in humans.
 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.004
So they come from the Dutch
Hungry Winter of '44/'45,

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:53.202
when the Nazis basically cut
off the food supply to

00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:56.209
Amsterdam, and actually to much
of Holland.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.976
But you can also see this when
there have been historical

00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:01.660
famines in Scandinavia.
 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.838
In the late nineteenth century
there was a famine in Finland;

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:08.733
and more recently,
in the U.K.

00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:10.170
and the Philippines.
 

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.079
And you can reproduce this in
rats and sheep.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.194
By the way, the fact that you
can reproduce it in a model

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:18.737
system is quite important,
because it means that for

00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:20.879
whatever reason that thing
evolved,

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.966
that kind of reason must also
have been there for something as

00:08:23.966 --> 00:08:25.129
short-lived as a rat.
 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.937
Now if we look around the
world, about 20% of American

00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:36.980
adults are obese.
 

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.101
Interestingly,
in rural Mexico,

00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:42.389
60 to 70% are obese.
 

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.279
That's not something you'd
necessarily expect;

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:48.256
go into rural Mexico,
you don't necessarily think

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:53.063
that those people have a lot of
money to eat a lot of food,

00:08:53.063 --> 00:08:54.970
but they are obese.
 

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.840
The incidence of diabetes is
exploding;

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.720
so late-onset diabetes is
exploding.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.878
As you might expect,
most of them are in India and

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.301
China, simply because the
populations of India and China

00:09:07.301 --> 00:09:08.048
are so large.
 

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:12.066
And this is becoming a really
significant portion of the world

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:13.120
health budget.
 

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.720
So these are significant issues.
 

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.727
And if you look at percent
obese across many countries,

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:24.958
the least obese nation is
Japan, and a lot of the European

00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.778
countries kind of have low
levels.

00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:31.879
But the ones that have very
high levels of obesity are the

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:34.538
U.S., U.K., and Germany,
Australia.

00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:38.292
These are not necessarily the
ones in which this kind of

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:42.250
nutritional stress early in life
would be very frequent.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.428
It is much more likely that as
countries like India and China,

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:50.139
and countries in Africa and
Mexico,

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.210
go through the demographic
transition,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.453
and go through the economic
transition into developing

00:09:55.453 --> 00:09:57.884
countries,
so that they have a parental

00:09:57.884 --> 00:10:00.278
generation that was more food
stressed,

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:03.038
and an offspring generation
which is more well fed,

00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:07.807
and more exposed to junk food,
that you will get this kind of

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:08.840
a response.
 

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.025
So when we look at this kind of
data, there's a lot of this that

00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:17.278
probably really isn't due to the
thrifty phenotype hypothesis.

00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:20.899
I would guess that of the total
amount of obesity that you see

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:23.836
in the world,
the part which is really due to

00:10:23.836 --> 00:10:27.168
a developmental switch being
thrown early in life,

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:31.038
and then setting that phenotype
up to respond inappropriately to

00:10:31.038 --> 00:10:34.182
a rich diet late in life,
thereby developing heart

00:10:34.182 --> 00:10:36.259
disease and obesity and so
forth,

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:38.590
at about the age of fifty or
sixty,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.149
is probably somewhere down
around 5%.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.566
So not all of it,
but probably a significant

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:46.519
component.
 

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:49.577
And the argument is that that
was something that was adaptive

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:53.211
in the Pleistocene environment,
because if you could switch the

00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:55.480
offspring into a thrifty
phenotype,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.751
it would have a higher
probability of surviving the

00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:02.614
dangerous childhood years and
making it perhaps to its first

00:11:02.614 --> 00:11:04.120
reproductive event.
 

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.628
And, in that environment,
what was going on at age fifty

00:11:07.628 --> 00:11:11.582
or sixty was probably irrelevant
because most of the population

00:11:11.582 --> 00:11:13.370
was dead by then anyway.
 

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.211
So that's the kind of
evolutionary argument that gets

00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:16.649
at it.
 

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:20.658
I don't think we actually know
what's selected for this.

00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:24.197
I think that we have a
plausible evolutionary story to

00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:27.067
tell about it,
but the fact on the ground is

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:28.870
that it really happens.
 

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.557
So it's important to know
about, and it might be for the

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:36.850
evolutionary reasons that I just
mentioned, but we don't know.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.620
Okay, now here's one where we
are a little bit more certain.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.259
And again, this is a hypothesis
that is in the category of

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:48.330
things where humans are
mismatched to modernity.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.806
So they are experiencing a
disease which is caused,

00:11:53.806 --> 00:12:00.158
in part, by our historical
shift into a civilized state.

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:03.474
It runs like this:
our immune system coevolved

00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:05.389
with worms and bacteria.
 

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:09.543
So it more or less evolved on
the assumption that we would

00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:12.970
always have worms and bacteria
in our bodies.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.441
And when modern hygiene--so
basically good clean water

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:20.323
systems--
and antibiotics take out the

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:23.519
worms and bacteria,
our immune systems respond

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.649
inappropriately.
 

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.620
We can see that autoimmune
diseases are actually exploding.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.840
So asthma, allergy,
Type-1 diabetes,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.250
multiple sclerosis,
other auto--Crohn's

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.610
disease--other autoimmune
diseases are increasing very

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.500
rapidly.
 

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.125
And as the infectious diseases
have gone down,

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.399
the autoimmune diseases have
gone up.

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:44.230
So there are some spatial
correlations that are

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.029
suggestive.
 

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:48.038
I'll show you some data that
are tighter than this.

00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:52.561
But if you look across the
planet, you can see that where

00:12:52.561 --> 00:12:55.629
diabetes, Type-1 diabetes is
common.

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:58.690
Type-1 is an autoimmune
disease, okay?

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.528
You see Type-1 diabetes being
common basically in Europe and

00:13:03.528 --> 00:13:07.054
in Australia,
and it's also fairly common in

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:08.450
Saudi Arabia.
 

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.840
And if you look at where worms
and leprosy are common,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.373
where countries that have a
fairly high incidence of these

00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:22.523
different worm infections,
those are pretty much across

00:13:22.523 --> 00:13:23.379
the Tropics.
 

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:26.522
The countries where there's no
data basically,

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:27.570
are in white.
 

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.038
So this is a partial plot.
 

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:33.000
And if you look at Type-1
diabetes against tuberculosis,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.532
you see where there's a lot of
Type-1 diabetes there's not very

00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:37.745
much tuberculosis,
and where there's a lot of

00:13:37.745 --> 00:13:40.460
tuberculosis there's not very
much Type-1 diabetes.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.173
Okay?
 

00:13:41.173 --> 00:13:47.179
So that's a negative spatial
correlation.

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:49.379
There's more data than that.
 

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:51.946
In Germany, and in other
European countries,

00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:55.288
farm children have fewer
allergies than city children.

00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:59.966
If you go to Gabon and you go
around testing by just nicking

00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:03.928
people on their arms--which is a
very easy test;

00:14:03.928 --> 00:14:08.091
you just apply a little bit of
dust mite egg to somebody's arm

00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:10.820
and see whether they have a
reaction--

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.480
the kids with schistosomiasis
don't have so many allergies,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.700
and they don't have a reaction
to dust mites.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.625
And if you look in these
countries, adults with less

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:27.940
asthma are more likely to be
infected with nematodes.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.979
And just let me comment before
I take that one off,

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:35.774
that if you are a doctor
working in the Tropics,

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:39.330
you almost never see autoimmune
disease.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.912
So if you go into
Médecins Sans

00:14:40.912 --> 00:14:43.106
Frontières,
and you go to Gabon,

00:14:43.106 --> 00:14:46.080
or you go to the Congo,
you'll see a lot of infectious

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.798
disease,
and you will see a lot of

00:14:47.798 --> 00:14:50.740
worms, but you will not see very
much autoimmune disease.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.789
That's the take-home message
from this summary.

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:57.408
Now how might this work?
 

00:14:57.408 --> 00:15:00.975
Well worms are big,
multicellular parasites,

00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:05.870
and they have to live in our
bodies a long time to reproduce

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.278
successfully.
 

00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:10.168
When they send their eggs out,
to get into another host,

00:15:10.168 --> 00:15:12.629
those eggs are going into an
extremely risky environment,

00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:15.928
and it's not very likely that
any single individual egg is

00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:17.028
going to make it.
 

00:15:17.028 --> 00:15:20.808
So the worms have evolved ways
of living in our bodies,

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:23.889
for a long time,
without being knocked out by

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.500
our immune systems.
 

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.360
This has been going on for
hundreds of millions of years.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.668
They're very good at it.
 

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:34.440
They are interfering with
signaling pathways that also

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.629
happen to be the pathways that
elicit allergies and asthma.

00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:46.000
Now think about it from our
point of view.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.337
We got these worms in our
system, and they got to be

00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:50.860
really good at living in our
bodies for a long time,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.823
but we have an immune system
that wants to react to them with

00:15:55.823 --> 00:15:59.787
a big inflammatory response,
but it's not going to be able

00:15:59.787 --> 00:16:02.297
to get rid of them,
because the worms have

00:16:02.297 --> 00:16:03.250
out-foxed us.
 

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.580
So we have to make the best of
a bad deal.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.511
What we have to do is we have
to down-regulate our

00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.325
inflammatory response,
in the presence of worms,

00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:13.600
so that we don't damage
ourselves;

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.407
because inflammatory responses
turn out to be one of the most

00:16:17.407 --> 00:16:20.009
damaging parts of degenerative
disease.

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:23.320
That's what's going on in
arteriosclerosis.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.190
That's what's going on in
rheumatoid arthritis;

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.499
you know, there's just a lot of
inflammatory response,

00:16:29.499 --> 00:16:31.558
damage can happen to your body.
 

00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:35.558
So our immune system basically
down-regulated,

00:16:35.558 --> 00:16:37.960
in the presence of worms.
 

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:44.368
Now that means both sides of
this co-evolutionary interaction

00:16:44.368 --> 00:16:45.970
have evolved.
 

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.558
So the causes really are rather
complex.

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:54.493
The parasites have been
removed, that actively

00:16:54.493 --> 00:16:57.639
down-regulate the immune
response.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:02.101
That leaves inappropriate
responses of our anti-worm

00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:05.211
machinery,
and that anti-worm machinery

00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:09.509
lacks proper targets and is
fooled by inappropriate targets.

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:12.352
There is ongoing research right
now to see whether or not this

00:17:12.352 --> 00:17:14.308
is in part the basis for nut
allergies,

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:15.859
which--things like peanut
allergies--

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.098
which have really exploded.
 

00:17:18.098 --> 00:17:22.547
It appears to be possibly part
of it, but probably not the

00:17:22.547 --> 00:17:23.640
whole story.
 

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.560
And then, of course,
we have changed our

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.358
inflammatory response.
 

00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:33.567
And another interesting part of
this--and again this is open

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:38.243
research--imagine your body
having come to evolutional

00:17:38.243 --> 00:17:41.509
equilibrium with worm
infections.

00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:44.544
So the worms are
down-regulating your immune

00:17:44.544 --> 00:17:46.286
system,
and your immune system is

00:17:46.286 --> 00:17:48.525
just--it has a lot of other
things to deal with besides

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.297
worms,
so it's cranking along,

00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:53.720
it's producing a range of cells
that can react to different

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.960
kinds of invaders.
 

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.588
And it has a screening
apparatus, which is in your

00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:02.990
spleen and in your thymus
glands,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.755
to screen out any molecule or
any population of cells that is

00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:12.519
recruited by your immune system
to attack your own tissue.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:15.519
And it's screening along at
that level.

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:18.470
Then you pull the worms out.
 

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.615
The immune system is no longer
down-regulating because of the

00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:23.539
presence of worms;
the immune system cranks up,

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:28.118
and it throws a lot of stuff at
that screening apparatus.

00:18:28.118 --> 00:18:30.815
But the screening apparatus
didn't evolve to deal with that

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:31.420
much stuff.
 

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.308
So it's kind of leaky.
 

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:38.585
So it is letting through more
cells that might react with your

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:39.710
own tissue.
 

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.809
Okay?
 

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:44.279
That's a hypothesis;
that's not a demonstrated fact.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:49.453
But what I'm trying to do is
I'm trying to indicate to you

00:18:49.453 --> 00:18:54.808
that this issue of autoimmune
diseases arises logically,

00:18:54.808 --> 00:18:59.224
either at the points where the
worms had been manipulating

00:18:59.224 --> 00:19:03.221
signaling in the immune system,
and then that has been

00:19:03.221 --> 00:19:06.997
withdrawn, or it is operating on
the screening mechanisms that

00:19:06.997 --> 00:19:09.349
are built in for the immune
system;

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:12.509
both could be going on.
 

00:19:12.509 --> 00:19:14.630
Now, what kind of data have we
got?

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.211
Well here--this is kind of
small, but basically what you've

00:19:19.211 --> 00:19:24.109
got here is a knockout mouse
that simulates Type-1 diabetes.

00:19:24.109 --> 00:19:27.125
Okay? So it's a model mouse;
people have genetically

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.239
constructed a model mouse,
to make it like Type-1 diabetes

00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:30.950
in humans.
 

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:36.573
And then they have infected it
with various kinds of worms to

00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:41.539
see whether or not it is
changing the T-cell bias in a

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:46.507
way that would be plausible to
basically down-regulate

00:19:46.507 --> 00:19:48.848
autoimmune disease.
 

00:19:48.848 --> 00:19:53.797
And these are things that
prevent Type-1 diabetes in

00:19:53.797 --> 00:19:55.348
knockout mice.
 

00:19:55.348 --> 00:19:59.425
So Schistosoma will do it,
Heligmosomoides will do it,

00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:01.348
Trichinella will do it.
 

00:20:01.348 --> 00:20:06.130
Mycobacterium--that's TB and
TB's relatives--will do.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.009
Salmonella will do it.
 

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:13.530
Basically infectious agents are
antagonists of Type-1 diabetes

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.980
in model mice.
 

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.596
And if you ask a little bit
more widely, if you have an

00:20:18.596 --> 00:20:22.817
animal model for another kind of
a disease, what can we treat it

00:20:22.817 --> 00:20:23.420
with?
 

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.717
Well we've got Schistosoma,
we've got Trichinella,

00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:29.910
Trichuris and so forth.
 

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.460
These things will prevent
colitis, inflammatory bowel

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.446
disease, collagen-inducted
arthritis, Graves' thyroiditis,

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:42.509
and so forth,
in model systems.

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:46.876
So there's some evidence in
animal model systems that this

00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:47.490
works.
 

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:53.970
So if you decided that you
wanted to do therapy on humans,

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:59.994
using these nasty worms,
which have a big yuck factor,

00:20:59.994 --> 00:21:03.519
which one would you choose?
 

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:08.211
Well you would want to have a
worm that doesn't really cause

00:21:08.211 --> 00:21:11.710
much pathogenic problem itself
in a human.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.410
You wouldn't want it to
multiply in the human.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.180
You'd want to be able to
regulate the dose.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.453
You wouldn't want the infection
to get away from you,

00:21:18.453 --> 00:21:19.838
in treating a human.
 

00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:22.808
You wouldn't want it to be
spread.

00:21:22.808 --> 00:21:26.490
You wouldn't want it to alter
the behavior in patients that

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.140
have depressed immunity.
 

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.234
You wouldn't want to be
affected by common medications

00:21:31.234 --> 00:21:33.279
like aspirin and stuff like
that.

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:35.170
Okay?
 

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.940
Well, which one will do that?
 

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.880
It turns out this pig whipworm
has these characteristics.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.259
And what you can do is you can
breed these things in the

00:21:45.259 --> 00:21:47.554
lab--I've seen them in Rick
Maizels' lab in Edinburgh,

00:21:47.554 --> 00:21:50.114
growing in a little vial;
they're whipping around in the

00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:54.221
little vial;
they look like little pieces of

00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:59.019
thread--and basically you use
their eggs.

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:04.278
Now here's some data.
 

00:22:04.278 --> 00:22:09.371
Patients with Crohn's disease
and ulcerative colitis improved

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.848
after ingesting 2500 pig
whipworm eggs.

00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:15.532
I mean, you guys all have
issues with what they're serving

00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:16.710
you in the dining hall.
 

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.210
&gt;
 

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.380
How about a little pig whipworm
egg?

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.491
People with Crohn's disease who
got a fairly prolonged treatment

00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:30.170
with this stuff responded well.
 

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.950
Patients with ulcerative
colitis, in a double-blind,

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.828
placebo controlled trial--which
is another step up in rigor--

00:22:38.828 --> 00:22:42.588
did better on worm eggs than
they did on placebos.

00:22:42.588 --> 00:22:45.681
But this is the one that really
gets me, and it's about multiple

00:22:45.681 --> 00:22:46.269
sclerosis.
 

00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.636
Okay?
 

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:49.358
This is a very,
very nasty disease,

00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:53.801
and multiple sclerosis is an
autoimmune disease that attacks

00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:57.038
the sheaths on the axons in your
brains,

00:22:57.038 --> 00:22:59.142
and it does so in a slightly
different way in each

00:22:59.142 --> 00:22:59.700
individual.
 

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.182
So the symptoms start
developing in different ways,

00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:04.962
but basically what's happening
is that you're losing your

00:23:04.962 --> 00:23:05.460
brain.
 

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.230
And these are some of the
symptoms: numbness,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.630
tingling, pins and needles,
weakness,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.286
spasm, spasticity,
cramps, pain,

00:23:14.286 --> 00:23:16.308
blindness,
blurred vision,

00:23:16.308 --> 00:23:18.250
incontinence,
urinary urgency,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.220
constipation,
slurred speech,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.026
loss of sex function,
loss of balance,

00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:26.816
nausea, disabling fatigue,
depression, short-term memory

00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:27.450
problems.
 

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.801
People with multiple sclerosis
often go to Switzerland to

00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:34.083
commit suicide;
I think about 60 of them have,

00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:37.931
because they're faced with
something which is a very

00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:40.269
painful way for life to end.
 

00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:43.785
Well there was a case control
study done recently in Argentina

00:23:43.785 --> 00:23:47.185
that showed that the progress of
multiple sclerosis is a lot

00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:50.990
slower in the patients that are
infected with parasitic worms.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.585
And that was convincing
enough--this was a case control

00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:56.172
study;
so for clinical medicine that's

00:23:56.172 --> 00:23:58.088
sort of the gold standard.
 

00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:00.996
You take a bunch of people and
you match them with cases and

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:04.000
controls, and then you see what
happens differently in the two

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.788
populations.
 

00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:08.363
So the data there was
convincing enough to persuade

00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:12.078
the NIH to begin a clinical
trial in Iowa in which MS

00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:16.509
patients are being treated with
the eggs of pig whipworms.

00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:21.598
Now this is the data from
Argentina,

00:24:21.598 --> 00:24:24.375
and the X--by the way,
the four panels are four

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:28.358
different ways of measuring the
progress of multiple sclerosis,

00:24:28.358 --> 00:24:32.872
and all four panels have a
five-year time axis on the

00:24:32.872 --> 00:24:35.372
X-axis,
and then they have some measure

00:24:35.372 --> 00:24:37.318
of multiple sclerosis on the
Y-axis.

00:24:37.318 --> 00:24:40.930
And in all four panels the
uninfected patients--

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.176
they were matched at the start,
infected and uninfected by

00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:46.210
worms,
and at the same stage of

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.881
multiple sclerosis--
the uninfected patients got

00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:54.390
worse, and the infected patients
did not get worse.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.640
Very clear.
 

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.515
When I first got in contact
with evolutionary medicine,

00:25:00.515 --> 00:25:02.805
this hypothesis wasn't really
out there yet,

00:25:02.805 --> 00:25:04.348
or wasn't very prominent.
 

00:25:04.348 --> 00:25:07.690
It came to my attention ten
years ago.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.682
I didn't believe it at the
time, and I'm actually rather

00:25:11.682 --> 00:25:16.329
astonished that this is the part
of evolutionary medicine that is

00:25:16.329 --> 00:25:20.250
actually resulting in an
important clinical result that

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.099
could change treatment and save
a lot of agony.

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:27.048
I hadn't expected that.
 

00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:31.492
So humans evolve more slowly
than their cultures,

00:25:31.492 --> 00:25:36.029
and therefore we are mismatched
to modern life.

00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:41.307
This is important in both our
diet and in our cleanliness and

00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:42.538
our hygiene.
 

00:25:42.538 --> 00:25:45.380
And it appears,
certainly for the hygiene,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.483
and quite possibly for
certainly people who are born

00:25:49.483 --> 00:25:53.588
very food stressed and then
encounter junk food,

00:25:53.588 --> 00:25:56.980
that that causes serious
medical problems.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.965
So one of the visions of
evolutionary medicine is that we

00:26:00.965 --> 00:26:05.380
evolved to a diet and an ecology
and a social life and a degree

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.224
of cleanliness that was
characteristic of a Pleistocene

00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:13.146
hunter-gatherer group,
and that that's now changed

00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:15.900
radically and we haven't caught
up yet;

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.640
our bodies have not yet
adjusted.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.517
The other thing that I want to
tell you about basically is

00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:26.490
about how pathogens evolve.
 

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.617
And they evolve very rapidly in
response to things that we do to

00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:35.200
them, both to antibiotics and to
vaccines.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.354
So the antibiotic resistance
story is in large part a story

00:26:40.354 --> 00:26:43.998
about hospitals,
because that's where most

00:26:43.998 --> 00:26:47.019
intense use of antibiotics is.
 

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.882
Virulence also evolves,
and there are lots of

00:26:52.882 --> 00:26:55.588
interesting stories about how
virulence evolved.

00:26:55.588 --> 00:26:57.734
For example,
plague in Europe,

00:26:57.734 --> 00:27:01.064
from 1348 to 1350,
getting less virulent as it

00:27:01.064 --> 00:27:04.228
goes northward;
or a new strain of syphilis

00:27:04.228 --> 00:27:08.329
coming into Europe from the New
World and getting into Naples in

00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:12.041
about 1500 and preventing the
French army from taking over

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:15.635
Italy at that time,
and then decreasing rapidly in

00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:17.210
virulence as it spread.
 

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.298
There are lots of stories like
that in history,

00:27:19.298 --> 00:27:20.480
and they're interesting.
 

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.958
But the issue that confronts us
today actually I think is most

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:29.910
tightly focused on what vaccines
will do,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.076
because we are now
contemplating vaccines for a new

00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:34.279
kind of disease,
not a childhood disease.

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.867
We're not looking at vaccines
that basically sterilize a

00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:37.480
population.
 

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.855
We're looking at imperfect
vaccines, and the issue is will

00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:42.930
they cause virulence to
increase?

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.730
So let's look at these.
 

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.089
So a little bit about
antibiotics first.

00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:51.390
Okay?
 

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:57.500
Almost all of the bacterial
genes that allow them to process

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.414
the drugs that we use,
and deal with those drugs,

00:28:01.414 --> 00:28:03.250
that provide them with
resistance,

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.950
evolved before the human drug
industry existed.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.672
And that's because bacteria
have been engaged in warfare,

00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:13.863
chemical warfare,
with each other and with fungi,

00:28:13.863 --> 00:28:16.390
for hundreds of millions of
years.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.460
And they are biochemical
maestros.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.736
They have developed a large
spectrum of synthetic capacity,

00:28:23.736 --> 00:28:26.759
and it's out there naturally in
nature.

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:31.180
There's about a ton of bacteria
per acre in a cropland;

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.430
that's about 10^(17th )bacteria.
 

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.230
That's an enormous number.
 

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.819
There's a lot of info that can
be stored in 10^(17th) bacteria.

00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:43.640
Here's a little bit of data.
 

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.759
Drug resistance evolves in the
soil and in wild animals.

00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:55.624
So if you go out and just take
out samples of spore-forming

00:28:55.624 --> 00:29:01.068
bacteria from soil,
that's not near a hospital,

00:29:01.068 --> 00:29:06.057
that's out there,
every single one of 480 strains

00:29:06.057 --> 00:29:08.670
of bacteria was multiply
resistant,

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.800
and there was no existing class
of drug that was effective

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.009
against all strains.
 

00:29:13.009 --> 00:29:15.410
That's just natural variation
that's out there.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.788
Okay?
 

00:29:17.788 --> 00:29:22.578
That is the downside of
biodiversity.

00:29:22.578 --> 00:29:27.230
There's a lot of evolutionary
potential in natural bacteria.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.900
If you go around the outback,
in Australia,

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.460
and you sample enteric
bacteria, that is gut bacteria,

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.330
from various Australian
mammals--you do this essentially

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.478
by collecting feces--
what you find is that they have

00:29:41.478 --> 00:29:44.740
multiply resistant strains of
bacteria;

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.424
and they have never been close
to a city, or to human beings

00:29:48.424 --> 00:29:50.299
that are taking antibiotics.
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.573
So that's on the one hand;
that's what's out there

00:29:55.573 --> 00:29:56.029
naturally.
 

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:57.430
Now what are we doing to it?
 

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.798
Well the agricultural use of
antibiotics is quite important.

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:03.618
I'm going to talk a bit about
hospitals in a minute.

00:30:03.618 --> 00:30:09.236
But the reason that farmers use
antibiotics is that by reducing

00:30:09.236 --> 00:30:12.858
the amount of energy that their
pigs,

00:30:12.858 --> 00:30:16.028
cattle and chickens have to put
into resisting disease,

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:18.490
their pigs, cattle and chickens
grow more rapidly.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.710
So it pays them.
 

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.210
If they use antibiotics,
they increase their production.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.280
So one antibiotic that's
actually quite critical is

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.338
vancomycin.
 

00:30:28.338 --> 00:30:31.816
Vancomycin has been the last
line of defense against multiply

00:30:31.816 --> 00:30:35.118
resistant staphylococcus aureus
for about twenty years.

00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:38.640
You don't want resistance to
evolve to vancomycin.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.868
If it does evolve to
vancomycin, it becomes very hard

00:30:41.868 --> 00:30:43.670
to do surgery in hospitals.
 

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.519
Well Danish farmers were using
vancomycin, and the Danish

00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:50.269
government noticed that and
banned it.

00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:55.474
So we have a before/after
comparison of how frequently do

00:30:55.474 --> 00:31:00.586
you pick up vancomycin resistant
enterococci bacteria in

00:31:00.586 --> 00:31:03.190
Copenhagen, in the city?
 

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.538
Well it dropped from 12% to 3%.
 

00:31:05.538 --> 00:31:09.306
There was a 9% rate drop in the
rate at which doctors picked up

00:31:09.306 --> 00:31:12.038
vancomycin resistant bacteria in
the city,

00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:15.720
when they stopped using it out
there on the farms.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.510
That is a measure of how dirty
the meat processing plants are,

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.630
on the one hand.
 

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.269
Okay?
 

00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:28.190
There's crap getting into the
meat.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.858
There's a movie about that,
by the way, about McDonald's;

00:31:30.858 --> 00:31:33.798
it will really turn your
stomach.

00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:38.056
But it also indicates just how
important the widespread

00:31:38.056 --> 00:31:39.788
agricultural use is.
 

00:31:39.788 --> 00:31:43.417
Now the other place where
there's really a lot of

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:46.140
antibiotic use is in the
hospital.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.413
Okay?
 

00:31:46.413 --> 00:31:48.940
So the Center for Disease
Control estimated--

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.714
I think this is in 2003--that
there were 90,000 residents of

00:31:52.714 --> 00:31:56.490
the United States that went into
the hospital for some other

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.439
reason,
picked up a resistant

00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:01.413
bacterium, and died of a
bacterial infection that they

00:32:01.413 --> 00:32:04.108
didn't have when they went into
the hospital.

00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:07.396
And when the cynical
researchers checked the claims

00:32:07.396 --> 00:32:09.828
to the health insurance
companies,

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:12.859
they discovered that the actual
number was probably ten times

00:32:12.859 --> 00:32:13.819
higher than that.
 

00:32:16.859 --> 00:32:18.700
So this is just for comparison.
 

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.972
AIDS was killing 17,000 a year
in the U.S.

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:23.680
at the time;
flu about 37,000;

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.380
breast cancer about 40,000.
 

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.057
So there are actually more
people who were dying of

00:32:28.057 --> 00:32:31.219
bacterial infections that they
acquired in hospitals than of

00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:33.470
all of these leading killers
combined.

00:32:38.118 --> 00:32:42.373
Now the bacteria that live in
hospitals are almost all either

00:32:42.373 --> 00:32:46.626
resistant or multiply resistant,
because that's where so many

00:32:46.626 --> 00:32:48.400
antibiotics are used.
 

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:55.150
And it's a good thing to use
antibiotics in hospitals.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.259
Okay?
 

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:58.098
When you bring somebody into
the Emergency Room,

00:32:58.098 --> 00:33:02.238
or if they're in Intensive
Care, and they are possibly just

00:33:02.238 --> 00:33:06.019
a few hours away from having to
have an operation,

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:08.650
you don't want them to be in a
susceptible state.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.508
You want them to be clean,
when they go into that

00:33:11.508 --> 00:33:12.700
operating theater.
 

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.786
So you're going to use
antibiotics on them to increase

00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:19.163
their probability of survival,
if they have to have a major

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:19.980
operation.
 

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.857
But the consequence of that,
which is of benefit for the

00:33:23.857 --> 00:33:26.890
individual, is a cost for the
population.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:32.430
And resistant strains are much
more expensive to cure.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:37.430
The cost of curing one case of
TB, if it's not resistant,

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.984
is about 15 to $20,000.00,
and the cost of curing one case

00:33:41.984 --> 00:33:46.141
of multiply resistant
tuberculosis is about a quarter

00:33:46.141 --> 00:33:48.140
of a million dollars.
 

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.578
So it's about ten times higher.
 

00:33:50.578 --> 00:33:53.251
So the economic burden for the
U.S.

00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:56.789
was about 80 billion annually,
for resistance,

00:33:56.789 --> 00:34:01.269
and the economic burden for the
planet is probably about a

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:02.450
trillion.
 

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.700
It's a big problem.
 

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.018
So basically I'm going to just
put--I'm not going to read all

00:34:09.018 --> 00:34:10.289
the way through this.
 

00:34:10.289 --> 00:34:10.634
Okay?
 

00:34:10.634 --> 00:34:14.288
Basically what this says is
people move back and forth

00:34:14.288 --> 00:34:18.079
between hospitals and nursing
homes, and when they move,

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:20.699
they move the bacteria with
them.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.460
And so however you're managing
it in the hospital,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.278
you have to deal with a
situation where it could be

00:34:26.278 --> 00:34:27.349
coming back in.
 

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:30.179
And I can tell you that if you
operate a nursing home,

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.822
you're just deathly afraid that
one of your patients in the

00:34:32.822 --> 00:34:35.739
nursing home is going to come up
with a multiply resistant strain

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.106
of bacterium,
because in old people that can

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:39.909
go through and just wipe them
out.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.739
You'll get incurable pneumonia
very quickly occurring.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:53.059
This idea--well let me just go
back here.

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:58.610
In this context of the ecology
of hospitals and nursing homes,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.918
there's been some fairly
sophisticated thought given to

00:35:02.918 --> 00:35:06.590
how should we manage the use of
antibiotics.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.815
The kind of simple-minded way,
which has often been used,

00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:12.579
is that well we'll just cycle
the antibiotics.

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:15.052
We'll use Antibiotic A for
three weeks in the hospital,

00:35:15.052 --> 00:35:17.159
and then we'll replace it with
Antibiotic B;

00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:20.570
and that way every time they
start to evolve resistance to

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.202
Antibiotic A,
they get hit with Antibiotic B,

00:35:23.202 --> 00:35:24.219
and so forth.
 

00:35:24.219 --> 00:35:27.141
It turns out that produces a
selection regime which is

00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:30.503
extremely effective at causing
the rapid evolution of multiple

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:33.036
resistance;
happens again and again and

00:35:33.036 --> 00:35:33.480
again.
 

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.360
Turns out the best way to
really screw up the bacteria is

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.760
to assign antibiotics at random,
to individual patients within

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.579
the hospital,
and change them about every two

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:45.989
days.
 

00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:48.440
Well that would drive the
nursing staff crazy;

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.130
I mean, that's just hard to
manage.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:50.960
Right?
 

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.929
But that's the most effective
method.

00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:55.849
Well if we apply that to
chemotherapy,

00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:59.443
what we notice when we look at
the community of oncologists is

00:35:59.443 --> 00:36:02.980
that many of them aren't aware
that a cancer is a genetically

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.219
heterogeneous population of
cells.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:08.112
I mean, the whole thing that
gets a cancer going is an

00:36:08.112 --> 00:36:10.789
optimum mutation rate,
and those cells continue to

00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:12.534
mutate;
so they become quite

00:36:12.534 --> 00:36:14.079
genetically heterogeneous.
 

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:17.434
It takes seven to nine
mutations to turn a stably

00:36:17.434 --> 00:36:21.070
differentiated cell into a
cancer cell, one after the

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.768
other.
 

00:36:21.768 --> 00:36:27.041
And those cells then--and by
the way, the mutations that do

00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:31.860
it are often mutations to the
DNA repair apparatus.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.351
So cancer cells tend to have a
pretty elevated mutation rate,

00:36:35.351 --> 00:36:38.202
and they become- a cancer
becomes very genetically

00:36:38.202 --> 00:36:39.250
heterogeneous.
 

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:44.400
So if you start prescribing one
chemotherapy,

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.619
and wait until it fails,
and then start another one,

00:36:48.619 --> 00:36:53.646
you are applying a selection
pressure that very effectively

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:57.199
selects for resistance to
chemotherapy.

00:36:57.199 --> 00:37:01.532
So if a more sophisticated
strategy were used,

00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:06.925
it's been calculated that the
lifespan of cancer patients

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:11.260
might be prolonged by well
several times;

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.789
it all depends on the cancer.
 

00:37:12.789 --> 00:37:16.280
But say take something like
breast cancer,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.684
instead of perhaps having a ten
or twenty year potential

00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:21.344
survival,
you might be able to manipulate

00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:25.202
the chemotherapy to have a
thirty to forty year potential

00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:28.164
survival;
which for many women would get

00:37:28.164 --> 00:37:30.230
it to their normal lifespan.
 

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:35.661
So this is a place where
evolutionary models can actually

00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:40.900
really help to better manage the
use of antibiotics.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.170
Okay, virulence.
 

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.820
Now I've used Ebola,
HIV and malaria to symbolize

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:54.632
the three different stages in
the evolution of virulence when

00:37:54.632 --> 00:38:00.349
a disease emerges and moves into
the human population,

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.750
and then starts to become
adapted to it.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.144
So the first phase,
which would be Ebola,

00:38:06.144 --> 00:38:08.521
Lyme disease,
bird flu, SARS,

00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:12.699
rabies, it's accidental;
it's an accidental infection.

00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:15.929
It's coming in from another
species, it's not adapted to us

00:38:15.929 --> 00:38:19.440
yet, and sometimes these things
are just incredibly virulent.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.760
By the way, they aren't always.
 

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.969
We probably don't even notice
the thousands that come into us

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.268
and never take root and die off
quickly,

00:38:27.268 --> 00:38:31.516
because they simply pass
without having caused any major

00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:32.289
disease.
 

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:35.239
But the point,
the reason that some of them,

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:38.532
some perhaps small proportion,
are highly virulent is that

00:38:38.532 --> 00:38:41.246
they've never had any
evolutionary experience in

00:38:41.246 --> 00:38:43.693
humans,
and they're not adapted to the

00:38:43.693 --> 00:38:46.090
level of virulence that's best
for them.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.032
They kill us too quick;
they kill us so quickly they

00:38:50.032 --> 00:38:51.099
can't get out.
 

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:56.289
Ebola is essentially a
self-snuffing disease.

00:38:56.289 --> 00:39:00.885
It won't spread out of one
village, because everybody's

00:39:00.885 --> 00:39:04.119
dead too quickly for it to
transmit.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:07.514
Phase Two would be one in which
the parasite's been established,

00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:10.369
but it's still far away from
its optimal virulence.

00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:10.681
Okay?
 

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:13.110
So this is probably the case
with HIV.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.869
The virulence of HIV is
probably still evolving.

00:39:16.869 --> 00:39:19.431
It's been in humans,
we think, about seventy,

00:39:19.431 --> 00:39:21.530
eighty years,
something like that.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.780
And the Myxoma virus that was
used on rabbits in Australia.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.132
So it evolved its virulence
downward in Australia,

00:39:30.132 --> 00:39:34.719
because it was killing rabbits
too fast.

00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:37.300
Then in Phase Three you're
dealing with a parasite that's

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.373
well established,
it's been in that host for a

00:39:39.373 --> 00:39:40.250
very long time.
 

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.619
It's probably at its optimal
level of virulence.

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:44.009
Okay?
 

00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:48.445
So yes, it will kill some
people, but it doesn't kill them

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:49.380
too fast.
 

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.023
It kills them at a rate where
most of it can still get out and

00:39:53.023 --> 00:39:56.489
get into another individual,
before the first host dies.

00:39:56.489 --> 00:40:01.500
And that's probably the case
with malaria and tuberculosis.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.440
So let's take something which
is in Phase Two,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.280
and put it to work.
 

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.353
So here's where virulence
evolution actually becomes part

00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:14.710
of a medical technology.
 

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.927
Microbiologists have been using
serial passage to produce

00:40:17.927 --> 00:40:20.110
attenuated vaccines for a long
time.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:25.184
And what an attenuated vaccine
is, is a pathogen that would

00:40:25.184 --> 00:40:29.733
cause a serious disease,
but it's been evolutionarily

00:40:29.733 --> 00:40:32.969
changed, so that it's
attenuated.

00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:36.590
It will infect you but it won't
make you sick,

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:41.050
and it will therefore elicit a
very strong immune response,

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.130
which is also effective against
the unattenuated relatives.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.809
And that's been used to produce
the Sabin oral polio vaccine;

00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:51.146
the measles,
mumps, rubella,

00:40:51.146 --> 00:40:53.079
yellow fever and chickenpox
vaccines;

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:57.396
one flu vaccine;
and a TB vaccine and a typhoid

00:40:57.396 --> 00:40:58.199
vaccine.
 

00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:02.431
So this is actually showing you
that rapid evolution of

00:41:02.431 --> 00:41:06.664
virulence is a medical
technology, and has been now for

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:07.920
fifty years.
 

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.880
The reason it works is that
pathogens evolve rapidly.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.998
And the results demonstrate
that there really are widespread

00:41:16.998 --> 00:41:20.210
tradeoffs in performance on
different hosts.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.539
This tradeoff right here,
that you do well on one host

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:29.438
and poorly on another--that a
jack-off-all trades is a master

00:41:29.438 --> 00:41:32.259
of none;
the master of one doesn't do

00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:35.675
well on another--limits host
range and constrains the

00:41:35.675 --> 00:41:37.579
emergence of new diseases.
 

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:40.867
So these kinds of data,
which basically were directly

00:41:40.867 --> 00:41:44.219
technically related to the
production of vaccines,

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:48.793
are indirectly telling us a lot
about pathogen evolution and

00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:49.570
ecology.
 

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.030
Here's the way it works.
 

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.309
What you do is you get a nice
genetically homogenous mouse,

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:57.588
which is not going to be any
kind of a genetic challenge to

00:41:57.588 --> 00:41:58.550
the parasite.
 

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.164
So you give it a sitting
duck--except it's a sitting

00:42:02.164 --> 00:42:05.070
mouse--and you inject it with
parasite;

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.030
parasite grows exponentially,
and while it's still in

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.989
exponential growth phase,
you take some of it out.

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:14.340
You remove its transmission
costs.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.409
You take away any tradeoff it
might have had with

00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:18.369
transmission.
 

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:18.715
Okay?
 

00:42:18.715 --> 00:42:22.173
So it's going to become really
bad at transmission,

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:25.840
but boy does it get good at
growing in this thing.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.681
You extract it,
you re-inject it,

00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:30.963
and you let it go through
exponential phase--you just keep

00:42:30.963 --> 00:42:33.440
it in exponential phase the
whole time.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.260
You're killing mice like crazy.
 

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.099
This is what happens.
 

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:40.039
This is a passage through mice.
 

00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:42.139
This is the percentage of dead
mice.

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:43.599
This is salmonella.
 

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:46.983
So you start it in a new host,
and it gets more and more

00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:48.460
virulent in that host.
 

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.465
As it specializes on its new
host, it gets really good at

00:42:52.465 --> 00:42:54.110
growing in that host.
 

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.780
This is what happens through
passages in cell culture.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.092
And this is the number of
monkeys being killed for polio

00:43:01.092 --> 00:43:01.429
virus.
 

00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:04.139
And this is actually Sabin's
original data.

00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:04.583
Okay?
 

00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:08.670
So he's passaging polio through
cell culture.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.750
So it's really good at living
in cell culture.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.340
It's getting really lousy at
living in monkeys,

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.300
and the longer it lives in cell
culture,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.496
the fewer monkeys it kills,
until after 50 passages in cell

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:22.179
culture it isn't deadly at all,
in monkeys;

00:43:22.179 --> 00:43:25.614
and at that point they began a
clinical trial and put it into

00:43:25.614 --> 00:43:26.130
humans.
 

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.871
Okay, so the point of that--I
mean, there are a number of

00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:40.349
points in that whole story about
manipulating virulence.

00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:43.889
One is, virulence can evolve
really quick.

00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:47.193
Virulence has been manipulated
by medical technology,

00:43:47.193 --> 00:43:50.496
for the last fifty years,
to produce some of the most

00:43:50.496 --> 00:43:52.909
successful vaccines on the
planet.

00:43:52.909 --> 00:43:59.659
That itself is an impressive
confirmation of this hypothesis,

00:43:59.659 --> 00:44:03.762
that I've just put up there,
which is that in order to do

00:44:03.762 --> 00:44:07.637
really well on one host,
you have to give up the ability

00:44:07.637 --> 00:44:08.739
to infect others.
 

00:44:08.739 --> 00:44:11.710
So if you want to produce a
vaccine that's a live,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.780
attenuated vaccine,
that infects a human,

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.650
you take it out of the human,
you put it into something else;

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.760
you make it really good at
killing that other thing;

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.005
it becomes lousy at killing
humans, and when it gets lousy

00:44:23.005 --> 00:44:26.655
enough at killing humans,
you can use it as a live

00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:27.550
vaccine.
 

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.007
Now there's one more thing I
want to tell you about

00:44:30.007 --> 00:44:32.271
evolutionary medicine,
and that's about whether

00:44:32.271 --> 00:44:34.730
virulence will evolve in
response to vaccines.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.268
So I've already introduced you
to the virulence transmission

00:44:38.268 --> 00:44:38.929
tradeoff.
 

00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:40.969
If you're too virulent,
you won't transmit,

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:43.690
because you will have killed
your host before you can get

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:44.079
out.
 

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:44.525
Okay?
 

00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:49.780
This is supposed to be the most
fundamental tradeoff shaping

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.829
virulence evolution.
 

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:56.333
It's thought to be widespread,
and it really is thought to

00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:59.730
drive virulence to an
intermediate level.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.105
There's quite a bit of evidence
indicating that this is,

00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:04.639
broadly speaking,
true.

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:05.869
Okay?
 

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:10.110
Now what happens when you make
an imperfect vaccine?

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.115
It does pretty well,
but it doesn't kill all of the

00:45:14.115 --> 00:45:16.679
pathogens in all of the hosts.
 

00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:17.018
Okay?
 

00:45:17.018 --> 00:45:19.260
That's why we call it
imperfect.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.280
Well that imperfect vaccine
will reduce the cost of

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.965
virulence by making likely that
some hosts will survive in the

00:45:25.965 --> 00:45:27.960
presence of virulent strains.
 

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.780
So you're getting a partial
immune response.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.699
The pathogen can persist in the
body, a longer period of time;

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:37.730
because, after all,
the vaccine is working a bit.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.159
But then if the virulent
strains are the more competitive

00:45:41.159 --> 00:45:43.119
ones,
and you've got multiple

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:46.760
infection, then the virulent
strains are the ones that are

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.338
going to be surviving the
longest in the bodies of people

00:45:50.338 --> 00:45:53.659
that have an imperfect response
to the vaccine.

00:45:53.659 --> 00:45:54.880
Okay?
 

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.605
So it turns out that this
actually happens in mice with

00:45:57.605 --> 00:46:00.007
malaria;
you can demonstrate with mouse

00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:01.969
malaria that this is the case.
 

00:46:01.969 --> 00:46:06.253
And the Gates Foundation and
WHO would like to vaccinate 500

00:46:06.253 --> 00:46:08.650
million humans against malaria.
 

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:11.440
All of the malaria vaccines are
imperfect;

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.764
as a matter of fact,
there isn't one that's really

00:46:13.764 --> 00:46:15.947
very good at all yet,
but it looks like all the

00:46:15.947 --> 00:46:17.800
malaria vaccines will be
imperfect.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.322
And that really creates an
ethical or public health

00:46:21.322 --> 00:46:25.550
dilemma, which is rather similar
to antibiotic resistance.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.403
It's going to be really good
for the individual human being

00:46:29.403 --> 00:46:31.730
to be vaccinated against
malaria.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.940
Hundreds of millions of lives
would probably be saved.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.699
But, as an unfortunate
byproduct of this wonderful

00:46:38.699 --> 00:46:41.172
thing,
we are probably going to have a

00:46:41.172 --> 00:46:44.909
situation in which the surviving
disease becomes more virulent,

00:46:44.909 --> 00:46:49.507
and a few people are then hit
by a really nasty strain of

00:46:49.507 --> 00:46:50.329
malaria.
 

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:53.322
So, as with antibiotic
resistance, it's probably a good

00:46:53.322 --> 00:46:55.373
thing to know,
that this might happen,

00:46:55.373 --> 00:46:57.980
so that you can start getting
ready for it.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.210
It's not a recommendation that
you don't vaccinate,

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:04.418
it's a recommendation that you
understand the consequences of

00:47:04.418 --> 00:47:07.170
vaccination,
which are evolutionary,

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.139
and be prepared to deal with
them.

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:13.994
So if you're interested in this
particular thing,

00:47:13.994 --> 00:47:17.610
I've listed authors that you
can search on.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:21.193
So the take-home on
evolutionary medicine basically

00:47:21.193 --> 00:47:24.849
is that evolutionary thinking
actually provides some

00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:28.862
interesting new illuminations of
problems in both medical

00:47:28.862 --> 00:47:30.869
research and practice.
 

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:33.059
But it certainly doesn't
eliminate,

00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:36.798
or replace, all of that other
important insight that we've

00:47:36.798 --> 00:47:40.250
gotten from molecular medicine,
and basically from

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.760
evidence-based scientific
medicine,

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.550
up to this point.
 

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.545
There's just a tremendous
amount in physiology and

00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:50.579
genetics and biochemistry which
is absolutely essential to know.

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:53.898
This, however,
also is something that is

00:47:53.898 --> 00:47:55.599
important to know.
 

00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:57.182
Okay, see you tonight,
if you're coming.

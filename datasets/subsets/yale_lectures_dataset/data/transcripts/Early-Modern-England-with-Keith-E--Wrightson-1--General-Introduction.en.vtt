00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.200
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.614
So this is History 251,
and this morning I want simply

00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:14.642
to introduce the class and to
explain what it might offer to

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:15.460
you.
 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.335
First of all,
it's obviously an outline

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:17.780
course.
 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.442
It deals with a large period of
history, 200-250 years,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:28.140
covering what I describe in the
title as 'Early Modern England'.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.595
Well, that's a label that may
or may not mean very much to

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:34.170
you.
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.208
I could have called the course
'Tudor and Stuart England' and

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:42.820
indeed that term is used in the
subtitle.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.889
It is about England in the
reigns of the Tudor and Stuart

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:54.850
monarchs running roughly from
the 1480s to the 1710s.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.807
But to call it that might
suggest that the course is

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:03.540
structured around the rulers and
that like so much history the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.180
focus is very much on the top.
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.120
Well, in part it certainly is.
 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.239
In introducing the political
narrative,

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.230
which will form part of the
core of the course,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.793
I'll certainly be looking at
the lives and the times of the

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:23.650
great figures who gave their
names to the age,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.470
the faces on the coins you
might say.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.406
The notorious Henry VIII and
his six unfortunate wives who

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:37.170
are always difficult to remember
in the right order--

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.086
and Lucy, you have a helpful
phrase for this,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:40.550
yeah?
 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.447
Student: Divorced,
beheaded, died,

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:43.920
divorced, beheaded,
survived.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.513
Prof: Okay.
 

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.524
Divorced, beheaded,
died, divorced,

00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:51.800
beheaded, survived--the lucky
one.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.840
Henry VIII.
 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.400
The stunning and rather
perplexing Queen Elizabeth

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.959
I--Gloriana, Good Queen Bess,
the Virgin Queen.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.995
Whether you imagine her as Cate
Blanchett or as Judi Dench

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:07.379
&gt;
 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.872
she still has the glamour,
a woman who announced to her

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:17.032
people early in her reign that
she would "not make windows

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.280
into men's souls."
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.729
She would "not make
windows into men's souls."

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.593
And she's continued to resist
the efforts of most historians

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.479
to try to make windows into
hers.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.139
And then there's the four
Stuart kings.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.145
James I described at the time
as "the Wisest Fool in

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:40.578
Christendom,"
a man who after an adventurous

00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:45.084
youth as King of Scotland became
King of England and it was said

00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:49.590
treated every day thereafter as
if it were Christmas day.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.508
Charles I, his son,
whose policies precipitated

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:58.788
Civil War in the mid-seventeenth
century and who was eventually

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:03.560
put on trial and executed by his
own people in 1649.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.769
His son, Charles II,
restored to the throne after

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.310
ten years of republican
government,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.669
Charles known as the Merry
Monarch,

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.680
the man who was energetic
principally in his pleasures,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.502
famous for having innumerable
mistresses and fourteen

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:24.596
illegitimate children,
never--though no legitimate

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:27.774
children at all--
never happier than when

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.229
swanning around St.
 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:34.460
James Park with one of his
mistresses and his spaniels.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.412
The--you know the King Charles
spaniel--a nice,

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:39.530
little black and white spaniel?
 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.788
Yeah, named after him of course.
 

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.822
And the King looked rather like
a King Charles spaniel

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:44.818
&gt;
 

00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:46.649
, you know when he had his wig
on--the nice,

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.990
curly ears as it were and he
had nice brown eyes too.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.300
&gt;
 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.830
And then his brother,
James II, former Duke of York,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.877
came to the throne and after
three years was driven from it

00:04:01.877 --> 00:04:05.188
in the second English revolution
of the seventeenth century,

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:08.473
driven in to exile,
later known as the King Over

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:11.758
the Water by those who remained
loyal to him.

00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:16.298
Well, it's been said that two
of the Stuart kings were

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:21.523
politically astute but morally
defective and two were virtuous

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:26.319
men whose political ineptitude
cost them the throne.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:31.108
To paraphrase Oscar Wilde,
we could say of this remarkable

00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:35.896
dynasty that to lose the throne
once could be considered a

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:40.851
misfortune but to lose it twice
suggests a certain amount of

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:43.120
political ineptitude.
 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.697
Well, you will hear and read
about all of these people and

00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:53.980
the many others who shaped
England's public destiny and

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.699
political destiny in this
period,

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.170
and others too--and today is
September 3rd,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.278
which reminds me of Oliver
Cromwell.

00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:07.016
He was born and died on
September 3rd and also fought

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:09.961
his two greatest battles on
September 3rd,

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.620
which is probably no
coincidence.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.439
It was his lucky day.
 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.262
The great puritan general,
the Lord Protector of the

00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:21.410
English republic between 1653
and 1658,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.980
a man described as a man of
'agonies and exultations,' a

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.389
quite extraordinary figure.
 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.649
An idealist in some ways,
ahead of his time on religious

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.327
toleration for example,
in other ways tainted by the

00:05:35.327 --> 00:05:39.697
bigotry of his age,
and historically perhaps more

00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:45.329
loved and more hated than almost
any other figure in British

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:46.379
history.
 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.517
So there are the great ones,
but there's also much more to

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:55.019
it than can be approached by
focusing on such figures alone.

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:59.668
And if about a third of the
lecture course is devoted to the

00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:04.550
political narratives and the--
and understanding how they

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.406
unfolded--
the rest is devoted to other

00:06:07.406 --> 00:06:10.923
aspects of the period,
to its religious history,

00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:14.906
to its social history,
aspects of its economy,

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:18.250
aspects of the culture of the
time.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.336
These are matters which might
sometimes have been vitally

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.329
influenced by the decisions of
rulers,

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:29.848
but they also developed in
their own independent ways and

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:34.529
they obviously involved a far
larger cast of characters.

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.252
So this course is very much
about the common people too and

00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:44.057
their experience of the age as
well as about those who ruled

00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:44.790
them.
 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.911
So like one of the great
Hollywood epics we have a cast

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.500
of millions.
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.940
That's why I'm using the more
capacious,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.297
if vaguer, label "Early
Modern England,"

00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:02.202
by which I mean simply the
broad period between the end of

00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:06.519
the fifteenth and the middle of
the eighteenth century which saw

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:10.014
the laying down of what were to
become the essential

00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:13.920
characteristics of modern
Britain in government,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.939
in religion,
in economy, in social

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:23.879
structure,
in culture, in political values.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.105
So I'm inviting you,
then, to take a journey of the

00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:32.079
imagination through two and a
half centuries.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:36.569
But you might say that was an
awfully long time ago.

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:40.223
This is the kind of history
that's long dead,

00:07:40.223 --> 00:07:42.300
that's drowned in time.
 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.406
Why should you concern
yourselves with the distant

00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:51.100
past, so remote from your own
contemporary experience?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.910
Why bother with England or
Britain?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.160
Why does it matter?
 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.384
Well, I'd say there are at
least three good reasons for

00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:08.480
exploring deep history and in a
way that takes us way beyond the

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.319
immediacy of a more familiar
historical world.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:16.334
First of all,
because to do so is

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:21.613
imaginatively enriching--it
involves rediscovering a lost

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:25.100
world and that takes
imagination.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.759
Secondly, because it's also
intellectually demanding.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.562
All history,
of course, involves us in a

00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:37.658
fairly rigorous intellectual
discipline.

00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:40.830
We have to develop arguments
about causation,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.720
about why things happened the
way they did,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.854
and we do that by establishing
a dialog between the questions

00:08:49.854 --> 00:08:54.904
that we want to ask and the
evidence which the past has left

00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:55.759
to us.
 

00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:00.614
Well, my point is simply that
that can be a peculiarly

00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:06.201
enthralling exercise for periods
of the distant past for which

00:09:06.201 --> 00:09:11.788
the evidence is often ambiguous
or difficult or partial,

00:09:11.788 --> 00:09:15.340
in which it's produced by
unfamiliar institutions,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.168
in which people are thinking
with unfamiliar casts of mind,

00:09:21.168 --> 00:09:25.613
and we have to try to think
ourselves into those minds to

00:09:25.613 --> 00:09:29.740
understand what was happening in
their own terms,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.830
informing our causal arguments.
 

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.049
That can stretch you
imaginatively and

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:36.529
intellectually.
 

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:40.946
And thirdly,
and perhaps most importantly,

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:44.070
because it creates meaning.
 

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:49.472
It helps us to understand
ourselves in time in a deeper

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:55.476
way by exposing twenty-first
century attitudes and values and

00:09:55.476 --> 00:10:00.778
experiences to a much deeper
comparative context.

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:05.562
Looking at the distant past can
alert us to the sheer otherness

00:10:05.562 --> 00:10:09.071
of the past,
to the reality of deep and

00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:14.857
fundamental change in the course
of four or five centuries and to

00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:20.374
the provisional and contingent
and temporary nature of so much

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:25.125
that we take for granted today,
as well as the family

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.740
resemblances which can still be
found.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:33.034
That's an exercise which can be
enormously provocative and

00:10:33.034 --> 00:10:38.515
stimulating, a challenge that
helps us understand better our

00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:40.558
own place in time.
 

00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:41.057
Right.
 

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:46.111
Well, the story of early modern
England has got a good deal to

00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.928
offer in all of these respects.
 

00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:52.460
It can certainly capture the
imagination.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.948
This was a time of great
events: the Reformation,

00:10:55.948 --> 00:10:58.929
the civil wars of the
seventeenth century,

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:02.418
the foundations of the first
British empire.

00:11:02.418 --> 00:11:05.216
It was a time of great
personalities:

00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:08.480
the rulers that I've already
mentioned,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.788
but also it was the age of
Shakespeare,

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:15.840
of Milton, the time of the
diarist Samuel Pepys,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.975
the proto-democrat John
Lilburne, the early feminist

00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:24.340
writer Mary Astell,
and so one could go on.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.206
It was a time of great
processes as well as events:

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:33.731
longer-term processes,
great changes in the structures

00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:36.657
of society,
in economic development,

00:11:36.657 --> 00:11:41.546
in political culture,
in the growth of literacy and

00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:43.058
print culture.
 

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:47.421
And it's also the period when,
almost for the first time in

00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:50.750
British history,
we have the evidence surviving

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.679
that enables us to get to grips
with the mass of the population

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:58.230
and to explore the everyday
dynamics of their lives,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.389
their relationships,
their emotional palettes you

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.428
might say.
 

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:07.302
It's only from about the early
sixteenth century that the

00:12:07.302 --> 00:12:10.485
sources survive in large
quantities that enable

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:14.427
imaginative historians to
approach questions like how long

00:12:14.427 --> 00:12:15.879
do people live?
 

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:20.710
How subject were they to early
death from diseases like the

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.460
plague?
 

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.240
What age did they get married?
 

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.668
Who chose their marriage
partners?

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:27.519
What was the quality of their
family relationships?

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:31.158
How many people could read and
what did they read if they could

00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:31.570
read?
 

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.678
How did people make their
livings and how did the economy

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:36.340
change?
 

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.976
What were the levels of crime
and violence and how well were

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:43.599
they controlled?--
and a host of other questions

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:48.211
which are not previously
accessible because we don't have

00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:49.860
adequate sources.
 

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.870
So one can begin to get a sense
of the rest of the population,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.620
and to give you just one
particular example,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.900
around about 1900 a box of
papers were found in the cellars

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.576
of Worcester College,
Oxford, and they turned out to

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:06.745
be the papers of the secretary
of the council of Oliver

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:10.259
Cromwell's army,
and they included a verbatim

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:14.479
shorthand account of debates
which had taken place in 1647 at

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:18.698
the end of the Civil War when
the council of the army debated

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:23.129
the settlement of the kingdom in
the aftermath of the war.

00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:26.937
One of the extraordinary things
about this verbatim account is

00:13:26.937 --> 00:13:30.058
that you hear the voices of the
common soldiers.

00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:33.134
One of them who is representing
a cavalry regiment keeps

00:13:33.134 --> 00:13:34.590
interrupting the debate.
 

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.365
He keeps saying,
"What has the soldier

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:37.759
fought for all this time?"
 

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:40.495
He uses the phrase again and
again: "What has the

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:41.889
soldier fought for?"
 

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:46.193
And it's thrilling because you
hear for the first time the

00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:50.346
voice of the common people
erupting into the councils of

00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.480
the nation.
 

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.326
Well, that symbolizes in a
sense what the available

00:13:56.326 --> 00:14:01.655
documents enable people to do
from the sixteenth century

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:02.820
onwards.
 

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.735
Secondly, looking at early
modern England can engage the

00:14:06.735 --> 00:14:07.590
intellect.
 

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.070
The historical literature is
exceptionally rich.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.780
It's very large,
created by generations of

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.418
historians from all over the
English-speaking world,

00:14:17.418 --> 00:14:22.019
and quite a few of them or
significant of them were Yale

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:22.940
scholars.
 

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.692
This literature has produced
many of the classic works of

00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:32.359
historical writing in the
English language and it's also

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:36.261
proved to be restless and
innovative and rather

00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:37.960
argumentative.
 

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.658
All of the recent movements in
historical research and writing

00:14:43.658 --> 00:14:47.769
are represented amongst its
practitioners;

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:50.658
mainstream political and
constitutional history,

00:14:50.658 --> 00:14:53.889
gender history,
the 'new social history,' the

00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:58.000
'new cultural history'
influenced by critical theory,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.524
what people now describe as the
'new political history' which

00:15:02.524 --> 00:15:06.750
tries to reintegrate social and
political development.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.450
All of this is represented and
much more.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.196
Since the 1960s in particular
it's been one of the most

00:15:14.196 --> 00:15:17.360
vigorous of historical
traditions.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.590
There's plenty there to engage
the intellect,

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.850
whatever it is that you happen
to be most interested in.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.664
And thirdly,
it helps to understand

00:15:28.664 --> 00:15:30.908
ourselves in time.
 

00:15:30.908 --> 00:15:34.587
Of course, all periods of
history do that,

00:15:34.587 --> 00:15:39.613
but the events of the early
modern period have a peculiar

00:15:39.613 --> 00:15:40.870
resonance.
 

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:45.991
The events and processes of
these centuries are of more than

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:48.509
merely historical interest.
 

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:53.115
If you're concerned with the
institutions of representative

00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:57.960
government and how they came
into being for the first time;

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.940
if you're concerned with the
notion of the rule of law;

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.745
if you're concerned with the
structures and dynamics of a

00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:09.451
capitalist market economy;
if you're interested in

00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:14.389
concepts of individual liberty
and collective responsibility,

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:19.168
or with the excesses of
religious fanaticism,

00:16:19.168 --> 00:16:23.807
or with innumerable social and
cultural attitudes which

00:16:23.807 --> 00:16:28.530
continue to echo in our own
relationships and in our own

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.884
time,
if we only know how to

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:33.948
recognize them,
and if you're concerned with

00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:38.001
the language itself,
then early modern England has

00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:40.820
got a great deal to say to you.
 

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.125
It's because these issues are
so alive in the literature of

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.690
the period that the literature
is so rich,

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.154
and it's for that reason also
that it's very much an

00:16:50.154 --> 00:16:51.990
international literature.
 

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.796
These issues concern scholars
from all over the world and

00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:58.720
there's a further dimension to
that too,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.464
which is that a great deal of
what happened in sixteenth- and

00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:08.128
seventeenth-century England
later impacted upon a much wider

00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:08.920
world.
 

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.288
The history of early modern
England is,

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:14.574
by extension,
very much a part not only of

00:17:14.574 --> 00:17:18.818
British history but also of
American and Canadian,

00:17:18.818 --> 00:17:21.160
Australian, and New Zealand
history.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.962
It's got things to say about
the history of India and of

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:26.750
Africa.
 

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.315
Some of the things that
happened in this period left

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:34.578
their fingerprints all over the
world in all kinds of ways.

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:38.769
They--it certainly left its
fingerprints on New Haven to

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:40.368
come close to home.
 

00:17:40.368 --> 00:17:44.905
If you look around the town and
you look at the churches:

00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:47.178
Episcopal,
Presbyterian,

00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:49.710
Congregational,
Baptists,

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.348
Quakers, all of these religious
traditions have their origins in

00:17:53.348 --> 00:17:55.950
sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century England.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.519
Or if you look at the street
names.

00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:00.818
Running out of Broadway we have
Goffe,

00:18:00.818 --> 00:18:05.902
Whalley, and Dixwell streets,
all three of them named after

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:11.334
three of the men who signed the
death warrant of King Charles I

00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:15.190
in 1649 and later hid out in New
Haven,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.750
which was a radically puritan
colony which gave them asylum

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.190
after the return of the king.
 

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.838
Our suburb of Hamden is named
after John Hampden who,

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:31.963
in 1637, stood up against the
policies of King Charles I and

00:18:31.963 --> 00:18:36.740
tried to fight him in a landmark
legal case.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.549
And if you start turning to
other place names in Connecticut

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:42.230
it just gets ridiculous.
 

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.990
We have New London,
okay, as old London.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.904
We have Norwich,
or 'Norrich' as it's pronounced

00:18:48.904 --> 00:18:50.640
in England, it's up there.
 

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.640
New Haven itself is down here.
 

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.480
We have Litchfield,
that's over there.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.220
And we have Durham--is up there.
 

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.936
And we have Stamford,
which is there,

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:04.660
yeah.
 

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.778
We have Greenwich,
which is over here.

00:19:07.778 --> 00:19:11.684
Same place names,
they're just in a different

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:16.300
configuration and,
in a sense, that's symbolic of

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.068
the relationship between British
and early modern--

00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:26.690
early American history:
same names,

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.759
different configuration,
slightly different meanings.

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:34.705
So in a sense a good deal of
this is American history by

00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:39.084
extension and of consequence to
everyone who's become involved

00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:43.390
in America's story over the last
two and half centuries.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:50.288
To explore it is to explore
part of your own identity.

00:19:50.288 --> 00:19:50.654
Right.
 

00:19:50.654 --> 00:19:54.178
Well, this course is intended
to provide an introduction to

00:19:54.178 --> 00:19:55.089
all of this.
 

00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:57.400
It's up to date.
 

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.798
It's also intended to be very
inclusive in its range and

00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:03.880
contents.
 

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.126
We'll run through from the late
fifteenth century to the early

00:20:08.126 --> 00:20:09.588
eighteenth century.
 

00:20:09.588 --> 00:20:13.372
We'll look at the momentous
changes and innovations which

00:20:13.372 --> 00:20:14.250
took place.
 

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.359
In 1500, England was very much
a personal monarchy.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:20.660
The king really ruled.
 

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.667
By 1700, it's a constitutional
monarchy in which the center of

00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:28.742
political life was a permanently
sitting elected parliament and

00:20:28.742 --> 00:20:32.161
it's become not simply the
Kingdom of England but the

00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:38.838
United Kingdom of England,
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:43.106
In 1500, England was part of
Catholic Christendom,

00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:47.895
practicing a very lively and
vital form of late medieval

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:49.288
Catholicism.
 

00:20:49.288 --> 00:20:53.315
By 1700, the country was
aggressively Protestant with an

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:57.559
established Church of England
which could no longer contain

00:20:57.559 --> 00:21:02.608
all the varieties of Protestant
denominations which had emerged,

00:21:02.608 --> 00:21:06.657
leading to the granting finally
of religious toleration in the

00:21:06.657 --> 00:21:08.450
late seventeenth century.
 

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.840
In 1500, it was largely a
localized economy of peasant

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.410
families and urban craftsmen.
 

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.880
By 1700, it was a highly
commercialized market economy,

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.204
capitalistic in structure and
engaged in trade with a much

00:21:25.204 --> 00:21:29.237
larger world,
especially with the East and

00:21:29.237 --> 00:21:30.960
with the Atlantic.
 

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.558
In 1500, it's a world of rural
communities and small towns with

00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:38.230
only one significant city,
London.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.916
By 1700, it was the most
rapidly urbanizing country in

00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:45.883
Europe, London had become the
biggest city in Europe and a

00:21:45.883 --> 00:21:48.180
kind of prototype metropolis.
 

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.255
In 1700, London was regarded as
a kind of a shock city the way

00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:56.328
people thought about New York in
the mid-twentieth century.

00:21:56.328 --> 00:21:59.538
In 1500, most people were
illiterate.

00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:02.000
By 1700, literacy was
widespread.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.701
There was a vigorous print
culture including the first

00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:06.230
English language newspapers.
 

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.699
And so one could go on and on,
pointing the contrast between

00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:12.170
the beginning and the end of the
period.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.941
The story of these and other
massive transformations used to

00:22:16.941 --> 00:22:20.578
be told as a kind of a
triumphalist story,

00:22:20.578 --> 00:22:24.198
an unfolding of British
destiny, what people refer to as

00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:26.828
'the Whig interpretation of
history',

00:22:26.828 --> 00:22:30.480
a very nationalistic take on
the history of this period.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.171
It traced the growth from the
sixteenth century of political

00:22:34.171 --> 00:22:36.470
liberty,
religious freedom,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.256
economic opulence,
and world power as a kind of

00:22:41.256 --> 00:22:43.608
steady upward ascent.
 

00:22:43.608 --> 00:22:47.140
Sometimes it had to be hard
fought against the forces of

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.900
tyranny or superstition or
backwardness,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.868
but in a sense it was portrayed
as being almost preordained,

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:58.288
a kind of English version of
manifest destiny.

00:22:58.288 --> 00:23:02.385
Well, since the 1950s,
the perspective has changed

00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:03.390
massively.
 

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.470
Britain's place in the world
has changed.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.019
People think about its history
differently.

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:10.868
New forms of history have been
pioneered.

00:23:10.868 --> 00:23:15.760
Other voices are now heard,
especially the voices of the

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.053
losers in these processes,
all the people who only had a

00:23:21.053 --> 00:23:24.890
subordinate place in these
achievements.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.980
As a result,
we've now got a less one-sided

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.848
and, in many ways,
a more mature historiography.

00:23:33.848 --> 00:23:37.597
We've got over the old tendency
to strut and swagger about

00:23:37.597 --> 00:23:39.440
Britain's historical role.
 

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.718
The changes of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries now

00:23:43.718 --> 00:23:46.568
seem very far from preordained
and,

00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:49.767
as I say, the less one-sided
perspective reveals the losses

00:23:49.767 --> 00:23:53.275
as well as the gains,
the failures and the crimes as

00:23:53.275 --> 00:23:55.170
well as the achievements.
 

00:23:55.170 --> 00:24:01.903
The point is it's all part of
the story and it's all available

00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:03.670
to be studied.
 

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:09.390
Well, let's look briefly at the
syllabus.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.848
It's roughly chronological.
 

00:24:10.848 --> 00:24:15.000
There's a timeline running
through the whole thing,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.318
but as it develops there are
overlaps.

00:24:18.318 --> 00:24:23.214
I planned it as a kind of
building up of layers of

00:24:23.214 --> 00:24:29.210
knowledge, each one acting as a
kind of stepping stone to the

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.108
next.
 

00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:32.230
In the earliest lectures,
lectures two to six,

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.442
I'll concentrate on trying to
establish some of the contexts

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:41.182
of society,
economy and government as they

00:24:41.182 --> 00:24:44.269
were in the early sixteenth
century.

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:47.170
I'll be looking at the
household, at local communities,

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.818
at people's social and economic
roles and relationships,

00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:56.189
at the structures of power and
authority as they were at the

00:24:56.189 --> 00:24:59.298
time of kings Henry VII and
Henry VIII,

00:24:59.298 --> 00:25:04.140
roughly between the 1480s and
the 1540s.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.978
That's to establish the context
because, as has been said,

00:25:07.978 --> 00:25:11.681
the discipline of history is
essentially a discipline of

00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:12.490
context.
 

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.425
Facts acquire their meaning
only when one understands the

00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:19.799
context which helps us to grasp
their meaning.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:21.430
So we'll set up the context.
 

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:27.690
Then from lecture seven we move
into the tracing of change.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.557
Lectures seven and eight will
look at the impact of the

00:25:31.557 --> 00:25:35.854
Reformation and the opening up
of religious divisions between

00:25:35.854 --> 00:25:37.858
the 1530s and the 1550s.
 

00:25:37.858 --> 00:25:40.902
In lecture nine,
we'll pause to look at some of

00:25:40.902 --> 00:25:45.134
the problems which were produced
by the massive population growth

00:25:45.134 --> 00:25:48.575
which began in the sixteenth
century and the economic

00:25:48.575 --> 00:25:50.890
stirring which that produced.
 

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.130
In lectures ten and eleven,
I'll look at the England of

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.590
Elizabeth I,
focusing on the problems in

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.808
religion and in government
policy faced by the Queen,

00:26:02.808 --> 00:26:06.996
the struggle for stability in
the immensely insecure

00:26:06.996 --> 00:26:11.759
environment which she inherited,
and then in lectures twelve and

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:15.421
thirteen I'll go on to look at
some of the principal features

00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:19.019
of social change under Elizabeth
and the early Stuarts,

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:22.759
looking at roughly the 1580s
through to the 1630s,

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:29.650
a period of major transition in
society and economy.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.796
Lectures fourteen through
seventeen will look at various

00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:36.230
aspects of social and cultural
change in the same period,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.960
the late Elizabethan,
early Stuart period.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.368
I'll look at the witch craze of
that time.

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:49.252
I'll look at crime and
disorder, at popular protest and

00:26:49.252 --> 00:26:53.828
rebellion and at literacy and
education.

00:26:53.828 --> 00:26:56.210
Then lectures eighteen to
nineteen,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:01.445
we'll come to the religious and
political tensions of the early

00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:06.259
seventeenth century which
eventually exploded in 1642 into

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:09.982
the civil wars--
which I'll look at in lectures

00:27:09.982 --> 00:27:14.300
twenty and twenty-one--
and the establishment after the

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.336
execution of King Charles the
First of the English Republic

00:27:19.336 --> 00:27:21.680
which lasted until 1660.
 

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.406
Lecture twenty-two will look at
the restored monarchy after

00:27:26.406 --> 00:27:30.318
1660, tracing it up to the
revolution of 1688.

00:27:30.318 --> 00:27:33.544
Lecture twenty-three will look
at the rapid economic

00:27:33.544 --> 00:27:36.577
development of the late
seventeenth century which

00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:40.498
provided the resources to back
the matter I'll treat in lecture

00:27:40.498 --> 00:27:44.285
twenty-four,
which was the creation of a new

00:27:44.285 --> 00:27:48.288
state structure and the
emergence of Britain as a

00:27:48.288 --> 00:27:50.539
significant world power.
 

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:52.490
So that's the rough timeline.
 

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.838
Those are the issues which will
be covered.

00:27:55.838 --> 00:28:00.679
Obviously, the course has an
essentially narrative structure

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:04.778
but it's also very much an
analytical narrative.

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:08.741
It's about trying to understand
how all of these changes

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:12.921
intersected with each other,
how they influenced each other

00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:13.930
over time.
 

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.980
And I suppose that's what
really interests me,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.730
trying to grasp the wholeness
of the process of historical

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.192
change,
how it all fits together,

00:28:23.192 --> 00:28:27.592
and that's the best reason for
doing an outline course of this

00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:28.170
kind.
 

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.259
It enables you to see these
developments in the round;

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:37.828
all the different aspects;
how they intersect.

00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:42.656
Now the readings which are
suggested on the syllabus will

00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:46.019
help you hopefully to do all of
that.

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:48.640
They've been chosen quite
carefully.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.121
The three textbooks are
available from the Yale

00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:53.029
bookstore.
 

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:58.058
The course packet of additional
selections from various books

00:28:58.058 --> 00:29:03.088
and articles is available from
Docuprint down on Whitney,

00:29:03.088 --> 00:29:07.250
the address is given on the
syllabus and the phone number,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.250
and all of these works are also
on reserve in the library,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.130
in Sterling.
 

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:19.450
The reading runs at about 100
to 150 pages a week.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.356
Now some of the readings you'll
find are quite demanding,

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:25.798
but I make no apologies for
that.

00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:29.455
You can say it's a mark of
respect for the capabilities of

00:29:29.455 --> 00:29:33.367
the students that I'm setting
some pretty challenging stuff at

00:29:33.367 --> 00:29:34.009
times.
 

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:38.069
But if you follow the readings
as we go through you should

00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:42.415
build up a coherent grasp of the
whole period in its different

00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:46.404
aspects and be introduced to the
work of some of the best

00:29:46.404 --> 00:29:49.538
historians currently writing
about it.

00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:57.546
In a sense it's a course in
good, lucid, robust historical

00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:58.670
prose.
 

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.820
The readings and the lectures
together will provide the basis

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.765
for the section discussions
which will tend to develop and

00:30:06.765 --> 00:30:11.470
add to the lecture themes rather
than simply repeating to them--

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.931
repeating them--and two of the
sections will be visits to the

00:30:15.931 --> 00:30:20.096
British Art Center to look at
some of the visual evidence

00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:20.838
there.
 

00:30:20.838 --> 00:30:25.248
Those visits have to be on a
Friday morning and they are

00:30:25.248 --> 00:30:27.402
optional;
they're not part of the

00:30:27.402 --> 00:30:30.611
examinable nature of the course
but they're there if you're

00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:32.880
interested and would like to go
along.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.868
Okay.
 

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:37.848
Within the sense of the whole
period,

00:30:37.848 --> 00:30:41.335
which I hope you'll develop,
you'll be asked to do two

00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:46.391
pieces of more detailed work,
a shorter paper of about five

00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:50.868
pages and a longer one of about
ten pages,

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:55.721
the first due in week seven,
the second due in week

00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:56.788
fourteen.
 

00:30:56.788 --> 00:31:00.568
This should give you an
opportunity to develop personal

00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:01.410
interests.
 

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:06.598
You can have a completely free
choice of topic.

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:11.354
You can write your papers about
any aspect of the period that

00:31:11.354 --> 00:31:15.950
you find interesting and you
want to pursue more deeply.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.269
I'll give out,
in a couple of weeks' time,

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:24.338
a list of topics that might
interest you,

00:31:24.338 --> 00:31:30.220
but feel free to bring forward
suggestions of your own that

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.664
you'd like to investigate,
or things you might pick up

00:31:34.664 --> 00:31:37.900
from lectures that you want to
take further and so forth.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.750
I'll also issue a longer
bibliography which will help to

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.318
prepare for those papers and
which will also include

00:31:45.318 --> 00:31:46.230
material.
 

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:50.825
If you'd like to look at the
history of Scotland or Ireland

00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:54.707
or Wales, then there'll be
material there on their

00:31:54.707 --> 00:31:56.450
developments also.
 

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:02.656
All you need to do about the
papers is to consult with me or

00:32:02.656 --> 00:32:09.180
with the teaching fellows to get
advice on the best reading for

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:15.176
researching the papers and
subject to that you have a free

00:32:15.176 --> 00:32:18.034
hand,
whether that's some of the

00:32:18.034 --> 00:32:21.592
classical issues of the period
or whether it's other things

00:32:21.592 --> 00:32:25.380
that you simply have to--
happen to have an interest in.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.173
Last year someone was
interested in public health and

00:32:28.173 --> 00:32:31.182
ended up doing work on the
plague and early public health

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:32.578
measures, for example.
 

00:32:32.578 --> 00:32:35.733
We had a person also who was
interested in pregnancy and

00:32:35.733 --> 00:32:36.480
childbirth.
 

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.180
Well, you can do that.
 

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.343
There's a literature on it and
so forth, whatever it happens to

00:32:43.343 --> 00:32:43.759
be.
 

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:50.223
The overall assessment will be
15% for participation and

00:32:50.223 --> 00:32:54.779
discussion,
20% for the short paper,

00:32:54.779 --> 00:33:00.750
40% for the long paper,
and 25% for the final exam,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:07.392
which will be an exam in which
you'll be required to write two

00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:14.252
essays from quite a large choice
of about twenty topics covering

00:33:14.252 --> 00:33:16.538
the whole range.
 

00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:17.074
Okay.
 

00:33:17.074 --> 00:33:22.210
Finally, let me introduce the
teaching fellows.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:31.356
We have Courtney Thomas and
Lucy Kaufman and Justin

00:33:31.356 --> 00:33:33.368
DuRivage.
 

00:33:33.368 --> 00:33:37.394
All of us will be available to
assist you in section

00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:39.288
discussions of course.
 

00:33:39.288 --> 00:33:43.455
We've scheduled seven sections
with quite a wide spread of

00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:48.279
times which hopefully will cater
for everyone who's interested,

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:50.619
and we will be available,
of course,

00:33:50.619 --> 00:33:52.440
in office hours.
 

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.290
The teaching fellows will
explain their office hours when

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.868
sections begin in third week.
 

00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:02.117
I'll be available usually on
Tuesdays between five and seven

00:34:02.117 --> 00:34:06.210
and on Thursdays between two and
four - p.m.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.550
in both cases.
 

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:13.414
Right, other times by
appointment and of course we're

00:34:13.414 --> 00:34:17.250
all available by e-mail when
necessary.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:21.579
Throughout, the basic teaching
philosophy for this course is

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:22.679
quite simple.
 

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.771
First of all,
history should be challenging

00:34:25.771 --> 00:34:30.041
but it can also be fun and,
secondly, if students are going

00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:32.840
to do well they deserve
attention;

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.510
so if you want it you can have
it.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.260
Okay.
 

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.789
So this is a terrific period to
study.

00:34:41.789 --> 00:34:45.000
It has a terrific literature to
work on.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.764
Yale has a long and
distinguished tradition in this

00:34:47.764 --> 00:34:51.360
field and fabulous resources for
studying it in the libraries,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.250
in the British Art Center,
in the special collections.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.431
My objective is simply to
encourage you to engage with

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:03.849
this field and to use these
resources and to do well,

00:35:03.849 --> 00:35:08.039
to achieve your potential and
to enjoy it.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:11.532
I've been teaching and
researching and writing about

00:35:11.532 --> 00:35:14.000
this period for about forty
years.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.206
Courtney and Lucy and Justin
have been at it less long but

00:35:20.206 --> 00:35:22.820
they know their stuff.
 

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.480
We have three teaching fellows
who really know their stuff.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.994
They have their own special
interests but they're very

00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:31.250
familiar with the whole picture.
 

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.411
We are in a position to guide
you and help you get the most

00:35:35.411 --> 00:35:38.521
out of this course,
and no doubt in engaging in

00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:41.811
discussion with you and in
discussing your paper topics and

00:35:41.811 --> 00:35:44.079
so forth we will also learn from
you.

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:47.664
People new to the subject
always see things that one's

00:35:47.664 --> 00:35:51.250
missed no matter how long one's
been working on it.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.719
So we'll be happy to do all of
that.

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:58.255
So if the course attracts you,
take it and use it and use us

00:35:58.255 --> 00:36:01.639
to develop your knowledge and
your skills.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:04.952
That's what we're here for,
and if anyone wants to ask any

00:36:04.952 --> 00:36:07.860
particular questions just come
on up at the end.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.590
Okay?
 

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:14.000

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.092
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so today I want to do

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:07.770
something a little bit more
mundane than we did on Monday.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.800
I want to go back and talk
about quantity competition.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.721
So in the first half of the
course we talked about price

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.621
competition.
We talked about quantity

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:19.147
competition.
We talked about competition

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:22.078
with differentiated products.
I want to go back and revisit

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:25.791
essentially the Cournot Model.
So this was the Cournot Model:

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.992
two firms are producing,
are choosing their quantities

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:33.248
simultaneously.
Firm 1 is choosing Q1 and Firm

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:36.868
2 is choosing Q2.
And all of this is just review

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:39.790
so this is all stuff that's in
your notes already.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.700
This is the demand curve.
It tells us that prices depend

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.740
on the total quantity being
produced.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.749
So this is Q1 + Q2 and this is
prices, then the demand curve is

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.820
a straight line of slope b.
That's what this tells us.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.370
Here's our slope –b.
And we know that payoffs are

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.450
just profits,
which are price times quantity,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.839
revenues,
minus cost times quantity,

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:12.640
costs, we're assuming constant
marginal costs.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.051
We did this model out in full
in maybe the third week of class

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.629
and we figured out what the best
response diagram looked like.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:24.346
And if you remember correctly,
this was the best response for

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:27.569
Firm 1 taking Firm 2's output as
given,

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.890
and this is the best response
for Firm 2 taking Firm 1's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.189
output as given,
and there were a few other

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.149
details in here.
This was the monopoly quantity,

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.076
this was the competitive
quantity and so on,

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:42.974
but this is enough for today.
Actually, we had done a bit

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.253
more than that,
we'd actually worked out in

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:48.400
class what the equations were
for these best responses.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Here they are.
I'm not going to re-derive

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.150
these today, but they're
somewhere in your notes.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.123
We kind of crunched through
some calculus and figured out

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.883
what Firm 1's best response
looks like algebraically,

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.798
here it is.
So this is the equation of this

00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:08.035
line, and similarly for Firm 2,
so this is the equation of this

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.352
line.
Finally, we figured out what

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:13.162
the Nash Equilibrium was,
and there's no prizes here:

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:16.457
the Nash Equilibrium in Cournot
was where these best responses

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:19.136
crossed,
and this is the equation for

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:24.970
the Nash Equilibrium.
Have I made a mistake?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.056
The best response, oh thank you.
The best response for Firm 1 is

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:32.370
a function of Q2,
exactly.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.308
Thanks Jake.
So this is all stuff we did

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:39.516
before, I want to go back to
this model now to revisit it in

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:42.669
the context of thinking about
sequential dynamic games.

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.816
So what we're going to do
is--we're going to do is,

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:47.263
we're going to imagine that
rather than having these firms

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:49.110
choose their quantities
simultaneously,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.879
one firm gets to move first and
the other firm moves after.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.086
Let's be clear,
we're going to assume that Firm

00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:58.771
1s moving first and the other
firm--we'll assume Firm 1's

00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:00.689
going to move first--the other
firm,

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.842
Firm 2, is going to get observe
what Firm 1 has chosen and then

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:09.453
get to make her choice.
So we're going to see what

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:12.991
difference it makes when we go
from this classic simultaneous

00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.409
move game into a sequential move
game.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.020
This model is fairly famous and
I'm almost certainly spelling

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.330
this wrong, but it's due to a
guy called Stackelberg.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.800
So what we're looking at now is
the Stackelberg Model.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.099
So how do we want to think
about this?

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.589
A natural question to bear in
mind is, assuming we're in this

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.389
world of quantity competition,
is it an advantage to get to

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.229
move first, to set one's
quantity first?

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.107
Or is it an advantage to be
able to wait,

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:46.919
see what the other firm has
done, and then respond?

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.755
Is there an advantage in going
first or is there an advantage

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:54.527
in knowing a bit more about the
other firm and being able to

00:03:54.527 --> 00:03:57.939
move second?
That's going to be the question

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.330
at the back of our minds for
most of today.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.870
So how are we going to think of
this?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.729
How are we going to figure this
out?

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.340
There shouldn't be a silence in
the room.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.930
There should be an instance
answer.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.819
How are we going to figure this
out?

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.830
We're going to use backward
induction right.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.300
This is going to be an exercise
in backward induction.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.724
We won't be able to draw a tree
here because the game's too

00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:21.939
complicated because there's a
continuum of actions,

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.379
but nevertheless,
we are going to use backward

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.565
induction.
So what does using backward

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:29.547
induction mean here?
Using backward induction means

00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:31.990
starting at the end and the end
is what?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.477
The end here is Firm 2.
Firm 1 is going to move first,

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:39.529
Firm 2's going to observe that
choice and then move.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.370
So the end of the game is Firm
2.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.560
So we're going to solve out
Firm 2's problem first.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.810
We're actually going to do this
entire analysis twice.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.426
We're first of all going to do
this analysis a bit intuitively

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.391
looking at pictures,
and then I want to go back and

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:57.544
crunch it out in the math.
I want to get used to seeing

00:04:57.544 --> 00:04:59.410
that we can actually do it
crunchily.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.592
This board is just review,
so I'm going to get rid of it I

00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:08.548
think.
I didn't manage to get rid of

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:11.022
it, never mind.
We're not going to be using

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:14.205
this board.
This is just what we did do in

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:19.189
the simultaneous move game,
so we'll get rid of it.

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.761
So in the sequential move game
we're going to start by

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:26.371
analyzing the move of Firm 2.
So imagine yourself as the

00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:29.005
manager of Firm 2,
you're coming along to make

00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:33.854
your output decision.
The output of Firm 1 is already

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:41.779
set.
So analyze Firm 2 first,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:54.370
Firm 2 sees Q1 and now I must
choose Q2.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.310
So what is Firm 2 going to do?
So I claim we already know this.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.460
We've already solved this
problem.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.005
When did we solve this problem?
Anyone know when we solved this

00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:09.632
problem?
The problem of what Firm 2's

00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:12.328
going to do.
Well we already solved it about

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:15.449
a month ago when we looked at
the simultaneous move game,

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.167
because what we worked out then
was what is Firm 2's best

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:24.800
response for any particular
choice that Firm 1 makes?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.560
We already solved out that
problem.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.560
It took us a while to solve
out, but basically it was to

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.269
maximize Firm 2's payoff,
taking as given Firm 1.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.750
We already know what the
equation looks like and let's

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.090
just remind ourselves what the
picture looked like,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.290
just a repeat of the picture we
had before.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.553
We said for any particular
choice of Firm 1,

00:06:45.553 --> 00:06:50.808
Firm 2's best response can be
drawn on a best response

00:06:50.808 --> 00:06:56.378
diagram, and looked like this.
It's exactly the picture we

00:06:56.378 --> 00:07:00.949
have up there.
So this is the best response

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:06.810
for Firm 2 taking as given the
choice of Firm 1.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.783
We even know the equation of
it--I won't bother rewriting

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:11.860
that.
We already know the equation.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.309
So in some sense Firm 2's
problem is a problem we've

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.585
already seen.
We already worked out months

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:19.584
ago what Firm 2 should do,
taking if Firm 1's output is

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:23.139
given and that's exactly the
problem Firm 2 finds herself in.

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.784
She wakes up one morning,
Q1 has been set already,

00:07:25.784 --> 00:07:28.483
and now she must choose Q2 to
maximize her profits,

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:31.019
so she's going to choose her
best response.

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.101
Just to remind you how we read
this picture,

00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:38.401
for any particular choice of Q1
we go up to the line and look

00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:41.769
across, this tells us what Q2
will respond.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:47.529
So if Q1 chooses this amount
then Q2 will choose this amount.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:52.850
If Q1 chooses this amount then
Q2 will choose this amount and

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.250
so on.
So there's no mystery here.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.420
We already know what Firm 2's
going to do.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:12.602
So by definition,
the best response of 2 to Q1

00:08:12.602 --> 00:08:31.198
tells us the profit maximizing
output of Firm 2 taking Q1 as

00:08:31.198 --> 00:08:35.630
given.
All right, so we've done the

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.283
second step for this already,
we already know what Firm 2's

00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:40.700
going to do.
Of course, the additional step

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.220
here now is that Firm 1 knows
that Firms 2's going to do it.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.335
Firm 1's going to move first
and Firm 1 knows that after she

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:53.383
sets her quantity Q1,
Firm 2 will respond by choosing

00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:57.092
her corresponding quantity,
which is the best response to

00:08:57.092 --> 00:08:59.692
it.
So if Firm 1 knows that if Firm

00:08:59.692 --> 00:09:03.812
1 were to choose this quantity,
then Firm 2 will respond by

00:09:03.812 --> 00:09:07.639
choosing this quantity,
and Firm 1 knows that if she

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:11.527
chose this smaller quantity,
then Firm 2 will respond by

00:09:11.527 --> 00:09:15.490
choosing this larger quantity.
Is that right?

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.899
So Firm 1 can anticipate how
Firm 2 is going respond to each

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:23.090
of these choices.
So let's just make that clear.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.157
So in particular,
if Firm 1 was to choose Q^1,

00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:30.412
I'm not suggesting it should,
but if Firm 1 was to choose

00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:34.857
this Q^1, then Firm 1 knows that
Firm 2 will produce this

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:39.052
quantity,
which is the best response to

00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:45.201
Q^1, and if Firm 1 were to
choose Q^^1, then Firm 2 will

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:50.679
respond by choosing the best
response to Q^^1.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:52.980
So this is pretty
straightforward so far,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.431
but what we're able to see now,
is the problem facing Firm 1,

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.559
which is the interesting
problem.

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:02.929
The problem facing Firm 1 is,
what quantity should Firm 1

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:07.690
choose knowing that this is how
Firm 2 is going to respond?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.613
Before we solve this out
mathematically,

00:10:09.613 --> 00:10:12.080
I just want us to think it
through a little bit.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.507
So the first way I want to
think this through is,

00:10:14.507 --> 00:10:16.480
is to make the following
observation.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.674
From Firm 1's point of view,
Firm 1 knows that any Q1 she

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:26.590
chooses leads to a response on
this line by Firm 2.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.896
That's what Firm 1 knows.
So Firm 1 is effectively

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:38.389
choosing points on this line.
Let me say it again,

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:42.356
so what's actually happening is
Firm 1 is choosing Q1 and Firm 2

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:46.259
is responding by choosing a Q2
that puts them on this line.

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:51.639
But in effect that means Firm 1
is choosing points on this line.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:57.508
So you could think of Firm 1's
problem as, choose the joint

00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:03.580
output level on this line that
maximizes Firm 1's profits.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.783
Think of Firm 1's problem as
choose the combination of

00:11:06.783 --> 00:11:10.350
outputs on this line by choosing
Q1 and then Q2 responds,

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.282
choose the combination on this
line that maximizes profits for

00:11:15.282 --> 00:11:17.381
Firm 1.
So I'm belaboring this a little

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:19.860
bit because it's a more general
mathematical idea here.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.460
How many of you are in Econ 150
right now?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.838
So for those of you in Econ
150, this should be a very

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:27.948
familiar kind of thing.
This is a constrained

00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.491
optimization problem and you've
been having constrained

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:33.223
optimization problems rammed
into you for the last month or

00:11:33.223 --> 00:11:34.587
so,
so this is an example of a

00:11:34.587 --> 00:11:35.879
constrained optimization
problem.

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:40.551
You have to choose a point but
you can't choose a point freely:

00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:43.639
you have to choose a point on
the line.

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:47.519
Okay, so let's talk about it a
bit more before we do the math.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.633
Let's actually redraw it again
since I made a mess of this

00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:51.180
picture.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.539
So one thing you might want to
ask is, in making this choice

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:06.855
for Firm 1, should Firm 1 choose
more or less or the same as it

00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:11.399
used to choose when the problem
was simultaneous?

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:14.506
So let's put in again what it
used to choose when the problem

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:19.980
was simultaneous.
I'll put it in just faintly.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.983
So here's our old Cournot
picture--looked like this--and

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:32.423
this was the quantity that Firm
1 chose in the Cournot game,

00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:37.916
so let me call that Q1C.
So certainly one possibility is

00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:41.610
that Firm 1 could choose her
Cournot quantity,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.731
she can certainly do that,
and she knows that if she does

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.926
that, Firm 2 will respond by
choosing the best response of

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:53.680
Firm 2 to Firm 1 choosing the
Cournot quantity,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.225
but we know what that is.
What's Firm 2's best response

00:12:57.225 --> 00:13:01.362
to Firm 1's Cournot quantity?
It's Firm 2's Cournot quantity,

00:13:01.362 --> 00:13:03.340
right?
So if Firm 2 does that,

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.619
if Firm 1 chooses the Cournot
quantity, then Firm 2 will also

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:12.510
choose the Cournot quantity.
So one thing that Firm 1 could

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.620
do is effectively choose the old
equilibrium.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.809
That's certainly something
that's available to Firm 1.

00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:21.720
But Firm 1 could also do other
things.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:28.033
Firm 1 could produce less than
that or Firm 1 could do more

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:31.401
than that.
So who thinks Firm 1 should

00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:35.220
play--should choose the old
equilibrium quantity?

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.919
Who thinks Firm 1 should choose
more than that?

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:41.179
Who thinks Firm 1 should choose
less than that?

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:44.129
Let's just try it with the
camera on you.

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:46.678
So once again,
how many people think that Firm

00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:49.340
1 should choose the old
equilibrium quantity?

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.649
A dribbling of hands,
and how about less than that?

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:57.333
A few hands and then they went
down again, and how about more

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.459
than that?
There's a majority for

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:03.360
more--turns out more is correct,
so that's good news.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.209
Why?
Why do we think Firm 1 should

00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:13.530
produce more than it used to
produce before?

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.190
Any takers on this?
Well let's think about it.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:20.360
As Firm 1 produces more,
or if Firm 1 were to produce

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.525
more, then Firm 2--my voice is
going--then Firm 2 would produce

00:14:26.525 --> 00:14:28.549
what?
Less.

00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:32.854
As Firm 1 produces more than
her Cournot quantity,

00:14:32.854 --> 00:14:36.279
Firm 2's response is to produce
less.

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.629
Does anyone remember the jargon
for this?

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:42.515
What do we call games where the
more I do of my strategy the

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:45.730
less you do of yours?
"Strategic substitutes," good.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:54.289
This is a game of strategic
substitutes.

00:14:54.289 --> 00:15:01.946
What that means is that as Q1
goes up, Q2, the best response

00:15:01.946 --> 00:15:07.299
of Firm 2 to Q1 goes down.
So what?

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:09.759
We can look at that just by
looking at the picture.

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:14.600
Well the "so what" is,
now we're in a sequential game.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.385
If Firm 1 produces more than
her Cournot quantity she induces

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:22.151
Firm 2 to produce less.
That's what we just said and

00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:26.360
that's what?
That's good for Firm 1.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.379
My producing more inducing you
to produce less is good for me.

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:33.780
It's going to keep prices
higher in the market.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.958
Is that right?
So let's just think it through

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.541
again.
In the Cournot equilibrium,

00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:42.945
the choice of Firm 1 was the
best choice for Firm 1,

00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:46.399
taking the choice of Firm 2 as
given.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.570
That was the old Cournot
quantity.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.656
But now in the Stackelberg
setting, the sequential setting,

00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:55.010
there's an additional feature.
Firm 1 doesn't have to take

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.006
Firm 2's output as given.
There's an additional reason

00:15:58.006 --> 00:16:00.820
for producing at the margin,
which is, at the margin if I

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.730
produced some more units of
output,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.330
that leads you to produce less
which is good for me.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.880
So that suggests that I'm going
to produce than I used to

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.100
produce under the old
assumption.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:29.997
So this suggests that Firm 1
should set Q1 bigger than Q1^(C)

00:16:29.997 --> 00:16:40.700
to induce Q2 to be less than
Q2^(C).

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.553
So the first thing we've
learned--we'll see this in the

00:16:43.553 --> 00:16:46.776
math later--is that Firm 1 will
in fact produce more than they

00:16:46.776 --> 00:16:50.778
used to under Cournot,
and that will result in Firm 2

00:16:50.778 --> 00:16:54.901
producing less than Cournot.
Now we've already got a lot on

00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:56.956
the board now,
we can actually solve out

00:16:56.956 --> 00:17:00.084
intuitively the problem.
Do we think that Firm 1's

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:04.039
profits, by this procedure,
are the same as they were under

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:06.348
Cournot?
Are they less than they were

00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:08.853
under Cournot,
or are they more than they were

00:17:08.853 --> 00:17:10.700
under Cournot?
So just let me say it again.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.475
Firm 1 is going first now.
We've argued that Firm 1's

00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:16.955
going to produce more.
Do we think that Firm 1's

00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:19.994
profits at the end of the day
are going to be the same as they

00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:22.385
were under Cournot,
higher than they were under

00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:24.690
Cournot, or lower than they were
under Cournot?

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.377
So let's have a poll again,
let me get the camera on you

00:17:27.377 --> 00:17:29.328
guys.
So who thinks their profits are

00:17:29.328 --> 00:17:31.869
going to be the same as they
were under Cournot?

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:34.440
Who thinks the profits have
gone up?

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.900
Who thinks the profits have
gone down?

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.675
We're in good shape here
because indeed the profits have

00:17:39.675 --> 00:17:41.225
gone up.
There's a very simple argument

00:17:41.225 --> 00:17:42.549
why the profits have to have
gone up.

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:44.950
How do we know the profits must
have gone up?

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.728
Let me actually--it's simple
enough--let me grab a mike on

00:17:47.728 --> 00:17:49.731
this.
How do we know the profits just

00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:51.556
must have gone up?
There was a hand in the back,

00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:53.829
was there a hand in the back?
Yes, way at the back.

00:17:53.829 --> 00:17:56.100
How do we know profits must
have gone up here?

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.568
Way at the back.
Student: If Firm 1 was

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:02.669
going to lower their profits
they wouldn't have chosen to

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:04.420
produce more.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.690
right, good exactly.
The fact that Firm 1 has

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.113
changed their output,
and in particular,

00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:12.444
are producing more,
tells you they must be able to

00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:15.130
increase their profits by this
maneuver.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.219
Let's just think that through.
One option that was available

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:23.680
to Firm 1 before was to set
output at the Cournot level.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.359
If Firm 1 had set output at the
Cournot level,

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:30.170
that would have led Firm 2 to
set output at the Cournot level,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.369
and in that case,
profits would have been exactly

00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:36.655
the same as before.
The fact that Firm 1 has moved

00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:40.490
away from that must mean there
are higher profits available.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.351
Say it another way,
Firm 1 could have had exactly

00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:46.332
what it had before,
so it must be doing at least as

00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:49.648
well as it was doing before,
and the fact it has changed

00:18:49.648 --> 00:18:52.569
means it must be doing better
than it was doing before.

00:18:52.569 --> 00:19:01.920
So indeed, Firm 1's profits
have gone up.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.236
We don't even need any math to
prove that: it just must be the

00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:09.588
case logically.
What must have happened to Firm

00:19:09.588 --> 00:19:12.507
2's profits?
What do you think has happened

00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:15.456
to Firm 2's profits?
That's not so immediately

00:19:15.456 --> 00:19:16.617
obvious.
It's obvious,

00:19:16.617 --> 00:19:19.515
I think, that Firm 1's profits
have gone up here because Firm 1

00:19:19.515 --> 00:19:22.272
could have had the same old
profits and has chosen something

00:19:22.272 --> 00:19:24.010
else.
But it's not immediately

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.079
obvious what happened to Firm
2's profits, is that right?

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:29.478
Before we get to what's
happened to Firm 2's profits

00:19:29.478 --> 00:19:31.359
let's go through an intermediate
step.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:36.649
Let's try and ask what must
have happened to total output in

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:41.849
the market in this example--in
this nice simple example.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.490
That's not immediately obvious
either.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.615
Why?
We've argued that Firm 1's

00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:55.585
output went up but Firm 2's
output went down relative to

00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:59.667
Cournot.
So it's not immediately obvious

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:04.349
whether the sum of those two Q1
+ Q2 went up or down.

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:10.198
We'd like to know what happened
to Q1 + Q2, total output,

00:20:10.198 --> 00:20:13.645
in the market.
By the way, one particular

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:17.675
reason we might care about this
is of course consumers would

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.849
like it to have gone up.
Because if their total output

00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:23.324
has gone up, prices have gone
down, and that's good for

00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:25.257
consumers.
So if you're the regulator,

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.982
if you're designing this
industry--if you're working for

00:20:27.982 --> 00:20:30.573
the Justice Department,
or if you're working for

00:20:30.573 --> 00:20:33.777
European Commission--you're
going to want to know the answer

00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:36.329
when we switch from a
simultaneous setting to an

00:20:36.329 --> 00:20:39.588
asymmetric setting where there's
a leader firm and a follower

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:42.064
firm,
is that going to be good for

00:20:42.064 --> 00:20:45.960
consumers or bad for consumers?
Well let's have a look.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.145
Well we know that Firm 1's
output went up and we know that

00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:52.217
Firm 2's output went down,
but can anyone tell me what

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.340
happened to the total output and
why?

00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:00.224
Let's have a poll again.
Who thinks total output went

00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:03.562
down?
Who thinks total output stayed

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.960
the same?
Who thinks total output went up?

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.215
There's lots of abstentions.
Let's try that again because

00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:13.457
too many abstentions.
Who thinks total output went

00:21:13.457 --> 00:21:16.477
down?
Who thinks total output stayed

00:21:16.477 --> 00:21:20.100
the same?
Who thinks total output went up?

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.685
That's pretty split.
So I think total output--I know

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:29.737
actually--that total output went
up, and I claim I can see it on

00:21:29.737 --> 00:21:33.075
the picture.
I claim if you stare at that

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:37.652
picture you can actually see
that total output must have gone

00:21:37.652 --> 00:21:39.135
up.
Who's good at looking at a

00:21:39.135 --> 00:21:42.160
picture?
Let me get the mike in here.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.420
The picture's there.
Let me try this person.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.779
Your name is?
Student: Andy.

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:50.779
Professor Ben Polak:
Andy go ahead.

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:53.195
Student: Judging by the
slope of the line you know that

00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:55.651
as it moves the amount that Q1
changes will be greater than the

00:21:55.651 --> 00:21:58.614
amount that Q2 goes down.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:21:58.614 --> 00:22:02.175
Good, so what Andy said,
what Andy's saying is look at

00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:05.200
the slope of the line along
which we slid.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.835
When we went from Cournot to
the Stackelberg equilibrium,

00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:14.801
we started here and we slid in
this direction down this line:

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:20.242
Q1 went up and Q2 went down.
And what Andy's pointing out is

00:22:20.242 --> 00:22:25.466
we can see from the slope of
this line that Q1 goes up more

00:22:25.466 --> 00:22:30.059
than one unit for every unit of
reduction of Q2.

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:33.587
Let me say it again,
for every unit of increase of

00:22:33.587 --> 00:22:36.466
Q1 there's less than a
proportion--sorry,

00:22:36.466 --> 00:22:39.746
say it again.
For every unit of increase of

00:22:39.746 --> 00:22:43.079
Q1 there's less than a unit of
decrease of Q2.

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:47.589
Another way of saying it is the
slope of this line is less than

00:22:47.589 --> 00:22:49.869
1.
Everyone see that?

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:54.654
So we know by the slope of the
line--we know that Q1 had to go

00:22:54.654 --> 00:22:59.415
up more than Q2 went down,
which means total output went

00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:04.636
up, which means that prices
went--what happened to prices as

00:23:04.636 --> 00:23:07.712
total output went up?
That shouldn't be hard,

00:23:07.712 --> 00:23:09.119
everyone's taken 115 here,
right?

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:13.043
So when total output went up,
prices went down,

00:23:13.043 --> 00:23:14.947
good.
Demand curves sloping down is

00:23:14.947 --> 00:23:17.563
not as important as backward
induction but it's still quite

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.440
important.
So prices went down.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.643
So therefore,
we now are ready to say what

00:23:21.643 --> 00:23:25.645
happened to Firm 2's profits.
Firm 2 is producing less than

00:23:25.645 --> 00:23:28.376
before.
Firm 2's costs are the same,

00:23:28.376 --> 00:23:32.550
and prices have gone down,
so what's happened to Firm 2's

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.068
profits?
They must have gone down as

00:23:37.068 --> 00:23:40.786
well.
So Firm 2's profit has gone

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:47.330
down, and we know that consumer
surplus, CS, consumer surplus,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.332
has gone up.
For those people who remember

00:23:50.332 --> 00:23:53.069
their 115, prices have gone
down, quantities have gone up,

00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:54.990
so consumer surplus here has
gone up.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.524
So we've analyzed everything
qualitatively I can think of in

00:23:58.524 --> 00:24:01.460
this game without reference to
any math at all.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.208
Is that right?
We really haven't done any math

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.049
there.
We talked about slope of the

00:24:04.049 --> 00:24:05.811
line.
I guess that's math in junior

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.528
high or something,
but we haven't really done any

00:24:08.528 --> 00:24:11.400
math here, right?
Is that fair?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.742
We already have a pretty good
intuition for what's going to go

00:24:13.742 --> 00:24:16.630
on in this market.
We think Q1's going to go up.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.688
We think Q2's going to go down,
we think that Firm 1's profits

00:24:19.688 --> 00:24:21.394
are going up.
We think Firm 2's profits are

00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:24.021
going down.
We think total quantity is

00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:26.410
going up.
Now let's see if we're right.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.045
Let's go back and do the math.
So I want to spend a bit of

00:24:30.045 --> 00:24:31.180
time grinding this out.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.329
So I don't claim that doing the
math is fun, but I want to prove

00:24:41.329 --> 00:24:43.742
that we can do it,
because otherwise everyone's

00:24:43.742 --> 00:24:46.720
going to either think that this
was all kind of just blah,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:54.292
blah, blah, and/or people are
going to be scared to do the

00:24:54.292 --> 00:25:00.670
math when it arrives on a
homework assignment.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.944
So for now we're going to--more
or less for the next few

00:25:02.944 --> 00:25:05.508
minutes--we're going to forget
we're economists and we're going

00:25:05.508 --> 00:25:08.336
to turn into nerds.
That isn't a huge transition,

00:25:08.336 --> 00:25:11.785
but we'll do it anyway.
I've got the demand curve up

00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:15.778
there, so the demand the curve
is still there it's P = A - B

00:25:15.778 --> 00:25:18.485
[Q1 + Q2]
and I've got profits written up

00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:20.904
there,
but let's put them somewhere

00:25:20.904 --> 00:25:27.634
more convenient anyway.
So P = A - B [Q1 + Q2]

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:42.075
and profit is equal to--profit
for Firm i is equal to P Qi--C

00:25:42.075 --> 00:25:45.259
Qi.
And what we're told to do in

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:47.974
backward induction is what?
First of all,

00:25:47.974 --> 00:25:51.724
solve things out for Firm 2
taking Firm 1 as given,

00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:54.799
and then go back and solve for
Firm 1.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:57.865
So exactly the discussion we've
just had informally,

00:25:57.865 --> 00:26:00.150
we're now going to do more
formally.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:13.203
So backward induction tells us,
solve for Firm 2 first,

00:26:13.203 --> 00:26:18.920
taking Q1 as given.
What is that problem?

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:26.708
It's this sort of boring math
problem, it says maximize by

00:26:26.708 --> 00:26:35.043
choosing Q2 the profits of Firm
1, so that's going to be A - B

00:26:35.043 --> 00:26:42.407
Q1--B Q2.
That's the price times the

00:26:42.407 --> 00:26:56.509
quantity Q2, - C Q2.
So this bit here is the price.

00:26:56.509 --> 00:27:00.394
These two terms together are
revenues, and this term is

00:27:00.394 --> 00:27:01.951
costs.
Now I could do that,

00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:04.748
I could grind that bit out,
but we already ground out that

00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.759
bit out three or four weeks ago
right,

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:08.706
so I'm not going to grind it
out again, we know how to do

00:27:08.706 --> 00:27:09.563
that.
But by the way,

00:27:09.563 --> 00:27:11.240
let's just remind ourselves
what we did.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.210
We differentiated with respect
to Q2.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.867
We set the thing we found,
the derivative,

00:27:16.867 --> 00:27:18.738
equal to 0.
That was our first order

00:27:18.738 --> 00:27:21.370
condition.
And then we solved for Q2.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.938
Is that right?
So when we did that,

00:27:24.938 --> 00:27:30.098
we went through the first order
condition and then we solved it,

00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:36.980
we know what we actually got.
So what we actually got was

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:46.288
that Q2*, if you like--or Q2
let's just call it--is equal to

00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:49.759
[A - C]
/ 2B - Q/2.

00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:52.395
In fact, I've already given it
to you up there,

00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:55.632
it's up on that top board.
It's the best response for Firm

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:56.779
2.
So again, I could do this

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.232
again, but since we did it a few
weeks ago I don't want to redo

00:27:59.232 --> 00:27:59.470
it.

00:28:06.369 --> 00:28:10.153
Now the more interesting part,
not thrilling,

00:28:10.153 --> 00:28:13.250
but a little bit more
interesting.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:23.089
Now let's solve for Firm 1.
So what is Firm 1 doing?

00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:26.559
Firm 1 is also trying to
maximize profits.

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:32.081
Firm 1 is choosing Q1 and Firm
1--at least initially it looks

00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:39.274
like the same problem.
It's A -B Q1--B Q2 Q1--C Q1,

00:28:39.274 --> 00:28:49.421
this is the same line we had
before but now whereas Firm 2

00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:57.291
was taking Q1 as given,
Firm 1 knows that Q2 is given

00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:02.858
by this formula here.
So what we're going to do is

00:29:02.858 --> 00:29:07.299
we're going to plug this Q2 into
there.

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:10.075
Now again, for those of you in
115, this isn't the only way to

00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:12.851
do it--I'm sorry 150--this isn't
the only way that we could do

00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:13.924
it,
we could also set up a

00:29:13.924 --> 00:29:15.639
Lagrangian equation,
but for those people who don't

00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:18.643
know what that is,
don't worry we're going to plug

00:29:18.643 --> 00:29:21.176
in today.
So we're going to plug this in,

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:24.074
and when we plug it in,
we get a right old mess but

00:29:24.074 --> 00:29:39.233
let's do it anyway.
So we're going to get max Q1,

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:54.073
[A - B Q1--B [[A - C]/2B -
Q1/2]

00:29:54.073 --> 00:29:59.340
- C]
Q1.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.122
Everyone okay with that?
I'm doing algebra on the board

00:30:03.122 --> 00:30:07.259
which is not fun but it's useful
to do occasionally.

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:08.509
So eventually what are we going
to do?

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:11.140
Eventually we're going to
differentiate this thing,

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.297
set it equal to 0,
look at our first order

00:30:13.297 --> 00:30:15.980
condition and so on,
just as we normally would.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.948
So eventually we're going to
use basically 112 level calculus

00:30:20.948 --> 00:30:25.186
to solve this thing.
Everyone remember how to solve

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:28.089
a maximization problem?
Yeah?

00:30:28.089 --> 00:30:32.190
But before we do that let's
tidy up the algebra a bit.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.680
So this thing is--let's just
tidy it up.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:42.153
So this is equal to max with
respect to Q1--and notice I've

00:30:42.153 --> 00:30:49.756
got an A - C here and once I
take this B inside the brackets

00:30:49.756 --> 00:30:53.880
I've got a--[[A -C]/2]
here.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.241
So I've got an [A - C]--[[A -
C]/2]

00:30:56.241 --> 00:31:00.409
so that's going to give me an
[A - C]/2--and I'm really going

00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:04.299
to pray that the T.A.'s are
watching me carefully and are

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:08.411
going to catch my errors here.
Okay, so I think I'm okay so

00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:10.900
far but please catch me.
What else have I got?

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:20.102
I've got a -B Q1 here and from
in this bracket I've got a - -

00:31:20.102 --> 00:31:28.634
that's a + B Q1/2.
So I have a –B Q1 + B

00:31:28.634 --> 00:31:38.543
Q1/2 so that's a –B Q1/2.
So far so good and that whole

00:31:38.543 --> 00:31:42.599
thing is multiplied by Q1.
Okay so far?

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:45.404
Let's multiply out the bracket
because otherwise I'll make a

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:52.656
mistake.
So this is the same as saying

00:31:52.656 --> 00:32:01.970
[A - C]/2 Q1--B Q1²/2.
So far so good?

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.430
Now we're at the level where
even my very rusty memory of

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.829
calculus will get us through,
so let's try and do it.

00:32:08.829 --> 00:32:13.430
So what we're going to do is
we're going to differentiate

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:20.213
this thing with respect to Q1.
So differentiating with respect

00:32:20.213 --> 00:32:28.253
to Q1--let's do it up here --,
we get [A -C]/2 from this term

00:32:28.253 --> 00:32:36.426
and from the –B Q1²/2
we're going to get--the two's

00:32:36.426 --> 00:32:43.796
are going to cancel rather
pleasantly--so we're going to

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:50.829
get B Q1 from that term.
Everyone with me so far?

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:53.074
I'm going through this in sort
of slow steps,

00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:56.287
I agree it's not exciting but I
want to make sure I don't make a

00:32:56.287 --> 00:32:58.151
mistake.
So to turn this into a first

00:32:58.151 --> 00:33:00.700
order condition what must be
true about this derivative?

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.963
At the maximum,
what must be true about this

00:33:03.963 --> 00:33:06.839
derivative?
Should be equal to 0,

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:12.150
good, and we should just check
the second order condition.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.829
How do I check the second order
condition?

00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:17.692
I differentiate again and check
it's negative,

00:33:17.692 --> 00:33:20.009
but if I differentiate again
I'm just going to get -B.

00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:23.263
So -B is certainly negative all
right, so second order condition

00:33:23.263 --> 00:33:25.380
is okay.
So let's solve it out.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:37.119
Solving this for Q1,
I get Q1 = [A - C]/2B.

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:41.845
So we're leading in sheer
boredom, it has to be done

00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:44.810
occasionally,
Q1 = [A - C]/2B.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.817
We're not done yet.
Now we want to go back and

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:51.750
solve out algebraically for Q2.
I know what Q1 is now,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.700
Q1 is [A - C]/2B.
How do I find Q2?

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.990
Somebody?
Shout it out, how do I find Q2?

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.498
I've got to plug it in.
I'm going to go back and plug

00:34:04.498 --> 00:34:09.096
this Q1 back into this
expression here,

00:34:09.096 --> 00:34:24.851
so I plug it back in,
I'll get Q2 = [A - C]/2B - 1/2

00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:41.130
[A - C]/2B for a total of [A -
C]/4B.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.490
Is that right?
That's what I have in my notes.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.230
This looks good.
So I'm now done.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.295
I've now found the equilibrium.
I've found that in this

00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:52.125
leader-follower game,
this Stackelberg version of

00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:58.438
quantity competition,
Q1 is given by [A - C]/2B and

00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:05.012
Q2 is given by [A - C]/4B.
Let's see how it matches up

00:35:05.012 --> 00:35:09.633
with the intuition we developed
before without using any boring

00:35:09.633 --> 00:35:12.449
math.
So first of all we're comparing

00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:16.889
Q1 and Q2 with what they used to
produce, and what they used to

00:35:16.889 --> 00:35:21.694
produce is on the top board.
What they used to produce--I

00:35:21.694 --> 00:35:27.047
can use this to guide the camera
as well--what they used to

00:35:27.047 --> 00:35:30.739
produce is [A - C]/3B,
is that right?

00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:36.136
So our claim was that we think
the new Q1 is bigger than the

00:35:36.136 --> 00:35:40.966
old Cournot quantity.
So now Firm 1 is producing [A -

00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:44.924
C]/2B, previously it was
producing [A - C]/3B,

00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:48.969
so that is indeed bigger,
that's good news.

00:35:48.969 --> 00:35:54.820
So this is indeed bigger than Q
Cournot.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.951
And our claim was that Firm 2
will produce less than the old

00:35:57.951 --> 00:36:02.181
Cournot quantity.
So Firm 2 used to produce [A -

00:36:02.181 --> 00:36:08.946
C]/3B and now it's producing [A
- C]/4B, and that is indeed less

00:36:08.946 --> 00:36:13.720
than the old Cournot quantity.
So far so good.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.170
What about total output?
How do I solve for total output?

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.980
Add the two outputs together,
that's not too hard.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:35.188
So Q1 + Q2 = [A - C]/2B + [A -
C]/4B which is in fact

00:36:35.188 --> 00:36:39.500
3[A--C]/4B.
Is that right?

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:47.794
So it's going to be 3[A--C]/4B.
So I've just--actually,

00:36:47.794 --> 00:36:49.572
for the first time today,
I skipped a step,

00:36:49.572 --> 00:36:52.327
but is that okay?
A half plus a quarter is

00:36:52.327 --> 00:36:59.070
three-quarters.
So total output is 3[A - C]/4B.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:07.446
What was total output before?
It used to be the Cournot total

00:37:07.446 --> 00:37:16.063
output, let's put it here
somewhere, this is bigger than

00:37:16.063 --> 00:37:25.150
2[A - C]/3B which is equal to
the Cournot quantity Q1^(C) +

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:28.583
Q2^(C).
So everything we've predicted,

00:37:28.583 --> 00:37:31.327
just by looking at the picture,
and thinking about the

00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:33.679
economics works out in the math.
That's a good thing.

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:35.170
We should feel a little bit
relieved.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.050
I'm feeling a little bit
relieved.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.695
Everything we thought out
intuitively, just using the

00:37:41.695 --> 00:37:43.730
economics, the logic of the
situation,

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:48.254
when we grind out the algebra
we get the right answers:

00:37:48.254 --> 00:37:51.269
we get confirming answers.
Everyone okay?

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:54.065
That isn't a particularly fun
exercise per se,

00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:57.606
but I want to do it just to
show that you can use backward

00:37:57.606 --> 00:38:00.340
induction to solve out problems
exactly.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.497
Backward induction and a little
bit of what you learned in high

00:38:05.497 --> 00:38:10.239
school and/or freshman calculus
can get you the answer.

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:13.140
So now I want to leave aside
the math and go back to the

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.765
economics again.
So we started off with a

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:19.255
question, who would you rather
be Firm 1 or Firm 2,

00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:23.281
and we know the answer now.
Who would you rather be Firm 1

00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:26.020
or Firm 2?
Firm 1 because Firm 1's profits

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.639
went up and Firm 2's profits
went down.

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:32.043
Let's just talk about this a
little bit--about what's going

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:35.227
on here.
So previously Firm 1 and 2 were

00:38:35.227 --> 00:38:38.579
just setting quantities
simultaneously.

00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:42.559
We know now there's an
advantage in going first.

00:38:42.559 --> 00:38:46.527
So suppose we change the game
from the simultaneous move game,

00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:50.559
to a game in which Firm 1 and
Firm 2 can make announcements.

00:38:50.559 --> 00:38:52.739
They can announce how much
they're going to produce.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:57.304
So Firm 1 comes in one day and
says, I'm going to produce this

00:38:57.304 --> 00:39:01.869
much and Firm 2 comes in and can
see Firm 1's announcement.

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:03.745
So I've changed it into a
sequential game,

00:39:03.745 --> 00:39:06.077
Firm 1 has announced how much
it's going to produce,

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.769
Firm 2 is going to go
afterwards.

00:39:07.769 --> 00:39:09.670
Is that really a sequential
game?

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.519
Is that going to make a
difference?

00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:14.353
Why is that,
I claim that's not really

00:39:14.353 --> 00:39:15.980
enough.
Let me say it again.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.130
We start from the simultaneous
move again.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.684
If we just change it by simply
allowing Firm 1 to announce what

00:39:20.684 --> 00:39:23.114
they're going to produce--don't
actually produce it but just

00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:25.010
announce what they're going to
produce --,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.799
you might think that's a
sequential move game and you

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:30.320
might think that Firm 1 now has
an advantage.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.383
But I'm claiming that's not
enough really to give Firm 1 an

00:39:32.383 --> 00:39:33.930
advantage.
Why?

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:39.445
Why is that not enough?
Let's try and get some ideas

00:39:39.445 --> 00:39:43.570
here.
Let me come around to this side.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.730
So Patrick why is that not
enough?

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.686
Student: There's no
credible commitment that you're

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:51.906
going to produce at that level.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:51.906 --> 00:39:56.465
Good, so imagine these two firms
are, let's say that they're

00:39:56.465 --> 00:40:00.870
newspaper producing firms and
one is owned by NBC's parent

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.579
company and one is owned by
Rupert Murdoch.

00:40:04.579 --> 00:40:09.139
And they're moving into this
new market and the market is a

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:11.286
town.
Both of them are going to issue

00:40:11.286 --> 00:40:14.169
newspapers in this market that
currently doesn't have any

00:40:14.169 --> 00:40:16.682
newspapers,
and Murdoch simply says I'm

00:40:16.682 --> 00:40:19.139
going to produce lots of
newspapers.

00:40:19.139 --> 00:40:22.190
There's no reason for NBC to
believe that.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.567
So moving first here,
it isn't enough to say you're

00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:28.945
going to move first,
it isn't enough even to make a

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:32.818
decision that's reversible.
Even if Q1 moved but that

00:40:32.818 --> 00:40:35.949
decision could be undone that
isn't enough.

00:40:35.949 --> 00:40:38.365
What we need,
and Patrick gave us the key

00:40:38.365 --> 00:40:41.504
word, what we need is
commitment: a word that came up

00:40:41.504 --> 00:40:45.672
last week.
So for moving first to help you

00:40:45.672 --> 00:40:49.960
here there really has to be
commitment.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.530
Let's just get some of this
down.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.570
There really needs to be
commitment for this to work.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.757
So going back to the example of
Murdoch and his competitor,

00:41:14.757 --> 00:41:17.789
Murdoch actually has to build
the plant.

00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:20.949
There actually has to be a
factory that he's built in,

00:41:20.949 --> 00:41:23.809
and that factory can't just be
sold for scrap.

00:41:23.809 --> 00:41:26.817
So what creates the commitment,
in the case when you've built

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:29.659
the plant is what?
Because having built it,

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:31.960
it's a sunk cost,
it's there.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:43.376
So sunk costs can help here.
It can help making you

00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:45.214
committed.
Once that money's gone,

00:41:45.214 --> 00:41:47.972
you can't get it back,
so you're really committed to

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.703
that scale.
Does everyone know what I mean

00:41:50.703 --> 00:41:52.480
by sunk costs,
by the way?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.929
So here's a case where a
strategic move,

00:41:55.929 --> 00:42:01.414
entering first and sinking some
investments can help you in the

00:42:01.414 --> 00:42:05.060
marketplace.
Let's also look at this another

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.146
way.
Let's again go back to the

00:42:07.146 --> 00:42:11.064
simultaneous move game that we
had before, where Murdoch and

00:42:11.064 --> 00:42:14.315
his competitor,
the NBC parent corporation,

00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:17.590
are in fact,
going to move simultaneously.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.733
Both of them are in the
business of discussing how big a

00:42:20.733 --> 00:42:23.991
newspaper plant to put in this
new town which hasn't got a

00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:27.495
newspaper yet,
somewhere in Alabama or

00:42:27.495 --> 00:42:30.958
something.
Suppose that there are two

00:42:30.958 --> 00:42:36.040
boardrooms, both of which are
avidly just trying to discuss

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.369
how big a newspaper plant to
build.

00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:44.762
So suppose that one of the
boardrooms, these four people in

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:50.433
this row, this is the NBC parent
company boardroom and they're

00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:54.710
trying to decide how big a plant
to build.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.802
And over on the other side of
the room is our Murdoch group

00:42:58.802 --> 00:43:03.317
which is in fact--let's take the
row parallel--so these guys over

00:43:03.317 --> 00:43:08.530
there are Murdoch,
are News International Group.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.991
And it is a simultaneous move
game, so basically we're in

00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:14.202
Cournot.
Now suppose that Murdoch,

00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:18.023
just to pick a name out of a
hat, might not be the most moral

00:43:18.023 --> 00:43:20.380
gentleman in the world--who
knows?

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.006
--and suppose that he in fact
has hired one of the people in

00:43:25.006 --> 00:43:27.751
the NBC boardroom,
in fact this guy,

00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.989
what's his name?
Student: Ryan.

00:43:29.989 --> 00:43:33.599
Professor Ben Polak:
He's hired Ryan to be a spy.

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:38.050
So Murdoch has a spy in the NBC
boardroom.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.863
So Murdoch has a little
advantage here,

00:43:39.863 --> 00:43:41.460
information wise.
Why?

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.449
Because the NBC boardroom
doesn't know what's going on in

00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:49.588
the Murdoch boardroom,
but the Murdoch boardroom is

00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:54.099
going to know what's going on in
the NBC boardroom.

00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:58.587
But to make the problem more
interesting, suppose that

00:43:58.587 --> 00:44:02.652
somebody tells NBCs parent
company, that in fact,

00:44:02.652 --> 00:44:05.869
there is a spy in their
boardroom.

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.789
So these guys know they have a
spy, they don't know who it is.

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:13.001
If they knew who it was they'd
beat him up or fire him or

00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:17.739
something --or maybe not--but
they know that someone's there.

00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:23.976
Maybe they even suspect it's
Ryan, so what should NBC do

00:44:23.976 --> 00:44:26.840
here?
What decision should NBC make?

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.482
One thing they could do
is--they don't know it's Ryan

00:44:29.482 --> 00:44:31.820
but Ryan has this sort of
Murdoch like face,

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:36.954
so they might just fire him
because he might be a spy--or

00:44:36.954 --> 00:44:41.619
what should they do here?
Any takers?

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:43.920
You're in the Murdoch,
you're in the NBC boardroom.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.980
You know that Murdoch has some
spy in the camp.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.965
What should you do?
Student: You can come up

00:44:51.965 --> 00:44:54.539
with a fake plan and see if it
goes back to Murdoch.

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:58.084
Professor Ben Polak: So
Chris is suggesting come up with

00:44:58.084 --> 00:45:01.285
a fake plan to feed it back to
Murdoch, so Chris has been

00:45:01.285 --> 00:45:03.248
reading spy novels.
So if this was a John Le

00:45:03.248 --> 00:45:04.597
Carré novel,
that's certainly what you would

00:45:04.597 --> 00:45:06.379
do.
You would create a whole bunch

00:45:06.379 --> 00:45:08.970
of fake information to feed back
to the Russians,

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.670
through this spy who in fact
you've discovered.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.001
That isn't a bad idea:
that might be a good thing to

00:45:14.001 --> 00:45:15.306
do.
It's pretty hard to do,

00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:18.254
right, because ultimately these
actual decisions have to be made

00:45:18.254 --> 00:45:20.619
in the boardroom,
contracts have to be signed and

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:23.110
so on, but I think Chris is onto
the right idea here.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:26.985
So Chris' idea is create a fake
plan to feed back to Murdoch,

00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:29.440
to give Murdoch some
misinformation.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.175
But there's another thing you
could do, let me get someone who

00:45:32.175 --> 00:45:33.880
hasn't contributed yet,
anyone else?

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.070
Yeah, what's your name?
Student: Usman.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.139
Professor Ben Polak: So
Usman what would you do?

00:45:38.139 --> 00:45:40.831
Student: These guys get
the first move now effectively

00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:42.670
because they can just decide
they know.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.636
Professor Ben Polak: Say
what you just said but shout it

00:45:44.636 --> 00:45:46.831
out so everyone can hear you.
Student: NBC now gets

00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:49.469
the first move because they can
decide and they know the other

00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:51.070
people are going to respond to
it.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.819
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so what Usman is

00:45:54.819 --> 00:45:58.951
suggesting is maybe you don't
feed Murdoch a fake plan,

00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:02.443
you feed Murdoch the true plan.
Effectively,

00:46:02.443 --> 00:46:06.510
what's going to happen now is
if NBC decided to build a large

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.834
plant,
this information will be fed

00:46:08.834 --> 00:46:11.343
back to Murdoch,
and Murdoch is now in the

00:46:11.343 --> 00:46:13.670
position of being the second
mover.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.659
When Murdoch moves,
he or she knows what NBC is

00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:22.255
doing, and NBC knows that
Murdoch is going to choose a

00:46:22.255 --> 00:46:27.123
best response to that.
So it's as if NBC has been put

00:46:27.123 --> 00:46:32.003
in the position of Firm 1 and
Murdoch has been put in the

00:46:32.003 --> 00:46:35.697
position of Firm 2.
Even with the correct plan--so

00:46:35.697 --> 00:46:39.074
the correct thing to do here for
NBC is not necessarily to

00:46:39.074 --> 00:46:41.741
mislead Murdoch,
but just go ahead and build a

00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:44.321
big plant.
Have that information be fed to

00:46:44.321 --> 00:46:46.449
Murdoch and let Murdoch respond
to it.

00:46:46.449 --> 00:46:50.280
So notice here's a slightly
paradoxical thing.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.565
You might think that having a
spy in the camp of the other

00:46:56.565 --> 00:47:02.300
team, you might think having a
spy would help you.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:13.601
But here having a spy--or
having more information if you

00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:21.820
like--can actually end up
hurting you.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.916
Everyone see that?
Paradoxically,

00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:28.387
Murdoch ends up losing by the
fact that he was able to predict

00:47:28.387 --> 00:47:31.427
what NBC was going to do.
Now there's a key to this of

00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:34.139
course.
It was crucial to the argument.

00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:35.070
What was crucial to the
argument?

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:40.923
It was crucial to the argument
that NBC knew that Murdoch had a

00:47:40.923 --> 00:47:48.112
spy.
The key here is that the other

00:47:48.112 --> 00:47:59.811
side, the other players,
knew you had or were going to

00:47:59.811 --> 00:48:06.590
have more information.
So what's the bigger idea here?

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:10.663
There are two bigger ideas.
Bigger idea number one is,

00:48:10.663 --> 00:48:15.843
games being simultaneous or
sequential is not really about

00:48:15.843 --> 00:48:19.570
timing per se,
it's about information.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.474
It's about who knows what,
and who knows that who's going

00:48:23.474 --> 00:48:26.622
to know what.
In a situation where Firm 1,

00:48:26.622 --> 00:48:30.676
our boardroom over here,
knows that Murdoch is going to

00:48:30.676 --> 00:48:34.130
have this information before
Murdoch moves,

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:37.929
that's actually a sequential
game.

00:48:37.929 --> 00:48:40.300
The timing is somewhat
irrelevant.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.380
So that's the first
observation, and the second

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.099
observation is already on the
board.

00:48:44.099 --> 00:48:48.017
What we have learned is
sometimes in strategic

00:48:48.017 --> 00:48:52.458
settings--sometimes not
always--more information can

00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:55.315
hurt you.
Sometimes more information can

00:48:55.315 --> 00:48:57.096
hurt.
We have to be careful here

00:48:57.096 --> 00:49:00.190
because that's not always true
but sometimes it's true.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:10.382
And the reason that's true
is--the reason is it can lead

00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:18.351
other players to take actions,
in this case,

00:49:18.351 --> 00:49:26.320
to create a large plant,
that hurt you.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.513
Now, if you put Monday's
lecture together with today's

00:49:29.513 --> 00:49:32.285
lecture, we've seen
something--two very similar

00:49:32.285 --> 00:49:35.443
things arose.
On Monday's lecture having

00:49:35.443 --> 00:49:38.151
fewer options,
burning your boats,

00:49:38.151 --> 00:49:42.583
ended up helping you or having
lower payoffs by putting

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:46.030
collateral down ended up helping
you.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.585
And that might seem like a
paradox but it isn't really a

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:51.186
paradox because what happened
was provided the other side

00:49:51.186 --> 00:49:54.024
knows you have fewer options,
they know you've burnt your

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:56.633
boats, or they know you'll
suffer if you default on the

00:49:56.633 --> 00:49:58.172
loan,
they know you've posted

00:49:58.172 --> 00:50:01.329
collateral, it will lead them to
take behavior that helps you.

00:50:01.329 --> 00:50:04.172
In the case of the loan,
it led to the lender giving you

00:50:04.172 --> 00:50:06.851
a bigger loan.
In the case of the Saxon Army,

00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:10.739
you at least hope at least that
the Saxon Army's running away.

00:50:10.739 --> 00:50:13.380
Today, we see that more
information can hurt you,

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.635
and once again,
it isn't really a paradox,

00:50:15.635 --> 00:50:19.481
it's the same kind of argument.
The fact that the other side

00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:22.774
know you're going to have this
extra information,

00:50:22.774 --> 00:50:26.480
leads them to take actions that
end up hurting you.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.722
So in games,
unlike in standard single

00:50:29.722 --> 00:50:34.453
person decision problems,
more information can hurt and

00:50:34.453 --> 00:50:38.659
more options can hurt and here's
the reason.

00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:42.138
Now, one other thing to say
about this, the game we just

00:50:42.138 --> 00:50:46.059
looked at, the Stackelberg game
we just looked at is an example

00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:53.193
of something pretty famous.
It's an example of first-mover

00:50:53.193 --> 00:51:00.631
advantage.
It's an example of a game with

00:51:00.631 --> 00:51:06.641
a first-mover advantage.
Now how many of you have

00:51:06.641 --> 00:51:10.062
heard--how many of you in the
room have heard the term first

00:51:10.062 --> 00:51:12.679
mover advantage before?
As few as that, seriously?

00:51:12.679 --> 00:51:15.580
The rest of you,
how many of you have not heard

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.860
the term first mover advantage
before, one or two?

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.000
So I'm always a bit weary of
first mover advantage as a term.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.591
If you ask the students in the
business school how many of them

00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:26.429
have heard the term,
they've all heard it.

00:51:26.429 --> 00:51:29.119
It's a very popular business
school term.

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:33.219
It's a very popular term that
you see in bad books.

00:51:33.219 --> 00:51:36.059
So let me just warn you a
little bit about this.

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:39.419
So if you go to the airport,
let's say the Hartford Airport,

00:51:39.419 --> 00:51:42.950
and the flight you want to get
on is late (which is usually the

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.021
case),
and hence you end up in the

00:51:46.021 --> 00:51:48.365
bookstore.
And you find yourself on the

00:51:48.365 --> 00:51:51.561
economics and business shelves.
You start looking at strategy

00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:55.214
books and typically the kind of
book you find at the airports on

00:51:55.214 --> 00:51:56.775
business,
or strategy,

00:51:56.775 --> 00:51:59.300
or economics is a pretty bad
book.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:05.651
So it has some embossed cover
on it and says 'Strategy for

00:52:05.651 --> 00:52:11.000
Dummies', or 'My Boring Life' by
a famous CEO.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.414
I worry about these books
because you end up buying these

00:52:13.414 --> 00:52:15.989
books.
You've got time on your hands,

00:52:15.989 --> 00:52:19.407
and you read them,
and they give you absolutely

00:52:19.407 --> 00:52:21.687
terrible advice.
So not always,

00:52:21.687 --> 00:52:24.663
but almost always,
and the kind of things they'll

00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:28.506
say is: "it's always a good idea
to move first because that way

00:52:28.506 --> 00:52:31.110
you'll have a first mover
advantage."

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.533
This sounds right and I'm
always worried about things that

00:52:35.533 --> 00:52:38.082
sound right.
It may mean they're right,

00:52:38.082 --> 00:52:40.332
but the problem is that if
they're wrong,

00:52:40.332 --> 00:52:42.920
they're tempting,
they sort of lure you in.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.036
So it's good to move first
because that way you have a

00:52:46.036 --> 00:52:49.329
first mover advantage sounds
right, but it's nonsense.

00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:53.290
There are situations of which
this is one--there are

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:56.630
situations where it's good to
move first.

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:59.163
In quantity competition it's
good to set your quantity,

00:52:59.163 --> 00:53:02.024
to be committed and that will
lead the other side to producing

00:53:02.024 --> 00:53:03.760
smaller quantity which helps
you.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.333
So sure, there are situations,
there are games in which you

00:53:08.333 --> 00:53:11.960
want to move first,
but there are also games in

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:17.340
which you'd rather move second.
Let me give you an example.

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.024
This is an example we've seen
in this class before- rock,

00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:25.104
paper, scissors.
If anybody is going to read

00:53:25.104 --> 00:53:28.427
those books and believe them,
so if anyone's going to read

00:53:28.427 --> 00:53:31.983
'How to Discover Your Inner Bill
Gates' and base their life on

00:53:31.983 --> 00:53:32.971
it,
and therefore,

00:53:32.971 --> 00:53:35.094
think there's a first move
advantage, I want to play rock,

00:53:35.094 --> 00:53:37.909
paper,
scissors with that person.

00:53:37.909 --> 00:53:40.034
Everyone happy that you'd
rather go second in rock,

00:53:40.034 --> 00:53:41.852
paper, scissors?
Do I need to prove that or is

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:44.539
that obvious?
Okay good.

00:53:44.539 --> 00:53:48.037
Let me just expand a little bit
more, into a more real world

00:53:48.037 --> 00:53:50.218
setting.
There are plenty of settings in

00:53:50.218 --> 00:53:53.088
the real world where the
advantage of moving second isn't

00:53:53.088 --> 00:53:54.618
because as in,
rock, paper,

00:53:54.618 --> 00:53:57.034
scissors you just get to crush
the other guy,

00:53:57.034 --> 00:53:59.780
it's simply that you learn from
their mistakes.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.384
So, for example,
in the game of buying new

00:54:02.384 --> 00:54:06.260
equipment for the office or home
it's great to move second.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.618
The other guy goes out and
samples some new piece of

00:54:09.618 --> 00:54:13.437
equipment, I wait to see if it
works, and then buy it if it

00:54:13.437 --> 00:54:15.728
does.
Or if I'm setting up a Firm in

00:54:15.728 --> 00:54:18.728
a new expanding market,
let's say in a new part of the

00:54:18.728 --> 00:54:21.172
former Soviet Union,
I'm quite happy to let some

00:54:21.172 --> 00:54:23.754
other firms go in there first
and then watch what they did and

00:54:23.754 --> 00:54:25.320
try and learn from their
mistakes.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.871
If I'm setting a new curriculum
for a university,

00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.210
I'm quite happy to let other
universities,

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:33.723
Duke and Cornell and so on,
move first and then I can go in

00:54:33.723 --> 00:54:37.095
as Yale, see what they did,
and for sure they'll have made

00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:38.980
mistakes and I'll learn from
them.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:43.057
So there's plenty of obvious
situations where moving second

00:54:43.057 --> 00:54:47.135
helps you, for the obvious
reason that information is often

00:54:47.135 --> 00:54:49.245
very useful.
We argued here,

00:54:49.245 --> 00:54:52.663
information can hurt you,
but there's plenty of other

00:54:52.663 --> 00:54:56.344
perfectly natural situations
where information is to your

00:54:56.344 --> 00:54:58.685
advantage.
So there are games with first

00:54:58.685 --> 00:55:00.648
mover advantages,
but there also games with

00:55:00.648 --> 00:55:03.395
second mover advantages.
And let me give you one example

00:55:03.395 --> 00:55:05.983
of a game that neither has a
first mover advantage or a

00:55:05.983 --> 00:55:08.660
second mover advantage,
just to convince you that can

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.661
happen as well.
So when you were a child you

00:55:11.661 --> 00:55:16.241
probably occasionally had to
divide a cake and/or candy bar

00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:19.010
with your sibling.
Anyone been in this situation?

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:21.947
There was some candy bar or
cake and you had to divide this

00:55:21.947 --> 00:55:24.378
thing between you and your
brother and/or sister,

00:55:24.378 --> 00:55:26.357
is that right?
There's a way in which,

00:55:26.357 --> 00:55:29.188
there's a typical way in which
we divide things among siblings

00:55:29.188 --> 00:55:31.396
in that setting.
There's a game we play to

00:55:31.396 --> 00:55:35.250
divide it.
What's the game we play anyone?

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.596
I'll cut and you choose,
or vice versa,

00:55:37.596 --> 00:55:39.641
right.
So I'll cut and you choose

00:55:39.641 --> 00:55:42.744
neither has first a mover
advantage or a second mover

00:55:42.744 --> 00:55:45.489
advantage--assuming you can cut
accurately,

00:55:45.489 --> 00:55:48.971
neither has a first mover
advantage or a second mover

00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:52.854
advantage, which is precisely
why it's a good way to divide

00:55:52.854 --> 00:55:55.685
the candy bar.
Now, to drive this point home

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:58.487
and because we've had a very dry
lecture up to now,

00:55:58.487 --> 00:56:01.290
let's play a game,
so everyone can wake up now.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:06.397
Math is over.
I want to play a game and the

00:56:06.397 --> 00:56:11.739
game I want to play for the rest
of today is called NIM.

00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:14.403
It's not going to surprise you
that one of the things we're

00:56:14.403 --> 00:56:17.020
going to learn in this game is
that sometimes games have a

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.499
first mover advantage and
sometimes games have a second

00:56:19.499 --> 00:56:25.401
mover advantage,
so I'm giving away the punch

00:56:25.401 --> 00:56:28.500
line.
How many of you have played NIM

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.989
before?
If you've played it before you

00:56:30.989 --> 00:56:33.340
can't play now,
so don't shout out.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.055
So this is the game.
There are two players and there

00:56:37.055 --> 00:56:41.254
are two piles of stones.
We'll make the piles of stones

00:56:41.254 --> 00:56:43.840
into just chalk lines on the
board.

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.519
The players are going to move
sequentially.

00:56:46.519 --> 00:56:49.393
In each turn,
the player whose turn it is to

00:56:49.393 --> 00:56:53.603
move, picks one of the two piles
and removes some of the stones,

00:56:53.603 --> 00:56:56.409
which will just be lines on the
board.

00:56:56.409 --> 00:57:00.989
So they decide how many of
those lines to delete.

00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:03.138
Each time it's your turn you
get to move again,

00:57:03.138 --> 00:57:05.099
you can choose the other pile
this time.

00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:08.974
You move sequentially,
and the only other rule that

00:57:08.974 --> 00:57:13.159
matters is, the person who gets
the last stone wins.

00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:16.274
So, for example,
here's a case where there's

00:57:16.274 --> 00:57:18.809
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:57:18.809 --> 00:57:22.934
seven stones on this pile and
one, two, three,

00:57:22.934 --> 00:57:26.495
four stones on this pile.
So I'm going to get some

00:57:26.495 --> 00:57:29.208
volunteers to come on the stage
and do this, but I was told I

00:57:29.208 --> 00:57:34.050
should choose a volunteer.
So is Lee-Shing Chang here?

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:38.820
So Lee-Shing Chang is going to
volunteer for this.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:45.480
I'm volunteering Lee-Shing
Chang because it's his birthday,

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.303
so a round of applause for
Lee-Shing Chang,

00:57:50.303 --> 00:57:54.788
come on the stage.
Who wants to play against

00:57:54.788 --> 00:57:56.890
Lee-Shing Chang?
Anyone else want to play?

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.695
Who hasn't played a game yet?
How about the guy with the Yale

00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:03.230
hat on back there,
the white Yale hat.

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.510
I'm staring right at the guy,
yeah you, do you want to come

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.140
up?
All right?

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.960
What's your name?
Student: Evan.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.079
Professor Ben Polak:
Evan, so we've got Evan and

00:58:13.079 --> 00:58:17.796
Leesing, is it Lee-Shing?
Lee-Shing and Evan,

00:58:17.796 --> 00:58:26.263
come up on the stage,
there's a step up here,

00:58:26.263 --> 00:58:30.092
come on.
So we'll let Lee-Shing go first

00:58:30.092 --> 00:58:32.621
and we'll let Evan go second.
Have you played this game

00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:33.362
before?
Student: I didn't hear

00:58:33.362 --> 00:58:34.363
what the game is.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:58:34.363 --> 00:58:35.895
Okay, he didn't hear what the
game is, so we'll explain the

00:58:35.895 --> 00:58:37.190
rules again for those people who
are sleeping.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.809
If you were sleeping the game
is backward induction.

00:58:39.809 --> 00:58:43.320
All right so the rules of the
game are this.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.487
They're going to take turns.
In each turn,

00:58:45.487 --> 00:58:48.059
they're going to pick one of
these two piles.

00:58:48.059 --> 00:58:51.260
This is Pile A and this is Pile
B.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:58.884
And they're going to tell me
how many of these chalk lines to

00:58:58.884 --> 00:59:04.730
delete, and I'm going to delete
those lines.

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:08.445
We're going to go on playing
until somebody gets the last

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:12.334
line.
The person who gets the last

00:59:12.334 --> 00:59:14.696
line wins.
You can get the last line,

00:59:14.696 --> 00:59:16.183
ten at a go,
it doesn't have to be that

00:59:16.183 --> 00:59:18.530
there's only one on the board
when you get the last line,

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:21.300
but the person who gets the
last line wins.

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:24.717
So you have to pick a pile each
go, and tell me how many lines

00:59:24.717 --> 00:59:26.766
to remove.
So Lee-Shing why don't you go

00:59:26.766 --> 00:59:29.518
first, you can choose Pile A or
Pile B and tell me how many

00:59:29.518 --> 00:59:33.550
lines to remove.
Any advice from the audience?

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:38.710
No advice: you're on your own
here.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:41.400
Student: Can you remove
three from Pile A?

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.125
Professor Ben Polak:
Three from Pile A,

00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:52.990
so three from Pile A.
Evan your turn.

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.450
Stand nearer to the board.

00:59:59.219 --> 01:00:00.730
Student: Can you remove
two from Pile A.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:03.514
Professor Ben Polak: Two
from Pile A--okay so Pile A is

01:00:03.514 --> 01:00:04.610
the popular pile here.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:24.068
Student: Two from Pile B.
Professor Ben Polak: Two

01:00:24.068 --> 01:00:27.950
from Pile B, suspense is
building here.

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:43.586
Student: One from Pile B.
Professor Ben Polak: One

01:00:43.586 --> 01:00:46.911
from Pile B, all right.
It should go fast at this

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.210
stage, go on.
Student: Two from Pile A.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.351
Professor Ben Polak:
Last stone wins,

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:52.369
last stone wins.
Student: Oh wait.

01:00:52.369 --> 01:00:55.471
Professor Ben Polak:
Last stone wins,

01:00:55.471 --> 01:01:01.110
be careful here.
It's his birthday come on.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:03.079
Last stone wins.
Student: As in who?

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:05.876
Professor Ben Polak:
Person who gets the last stone

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:07.586
wins.
Student: Oh okay,

01:01:07.586 --> 01:01:11.621
so one from A.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:15.110
right, one from A,
can't abstain.

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.194
Student: One from B.
Professor Ben Polak: One

01:01:17.194 --> 01:01:19.050
from B, Lee-Shing is the winner
here.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:26.280
Very good, let's get two more
volunteers.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.690
Everyone understand the game
now?

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:32.190
Thank you very much gentlemen.
Two more volunteers.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:36.139
Have you played before?
Come on up.

01:01:36.139 --> 01:01:37.610
I want to get some female
volunteers.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.150
It can't be a male only class.
There we go thank you.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.480
This may not be as important
economics as doing the

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.600
Stackelberg model but it's
probably a little bit more fun.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.520
Your names are?
Student: John.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.351
Student: Christine.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:01.469
John and Christine,
okay.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:04.268
So let's make it a bit more
complicated this time,

01:02:04.268 --> 01:02:05.809
so one, two,
three, four,

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.803
five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

01:02:08.803 --> 01:02:12.621
ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen and one,

01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:16.219
two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:18.493
So we'll pick two prime
numbers, and see if that's

01:02:18.493 --> 01:02:21.530
important.
Let's see what happens.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:26.160
Why don't we say ladies first,
so Christine your choice.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.133
Student: That one has?
Professor Ben Polak:

01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:32.496
This one started off at 13 I
believe and this one started off

01:02:32.496 --> 01:02:34.850
at seven, assuming I counted
correctly.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:40.869
Let me get out of the way.
Student: Six from Pile A.

01:02:40.869 --> 01:02:45.427
Professor Ben Polak: Six
from Pile A, one,

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:49.700
two, three, four,
five, six, is that right?

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.965
Okay.
Student: Three from Pile

01:02:51.965 --> 01:02:54.881
B.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:02:54.881 --> 01:02:57.935
Three from Pile B.
Student: Three from Pile

01:02:57.935 --> 01:03:00.986
A.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:04.110
Three from Pile A.
Student: One from Pile B.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:07.220
Professor Ben Polak: One
from Pile B.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.572
Student: One from Pile A.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:03:09.572 --> 01:03:13.890
right, so we're onto this.
Student: One from Pile B.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.260
Student: One from Pile A.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.550
right.
Student: One from Pile B.

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.440
Professor Ben Polak: All
right.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.946
Student: One from Pile A.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:24.079
right.
Student: One from Pile A.

01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:25.270
Professor Ben Polak:
Switch it.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:27.128
Student: One from Pile B.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:03:27.128 --> 01:03:28.659
right, so Christine is the
winner, okay.

01:03:28.659 --> 01:03:34.449
So a round of applause for
these two.

01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:36.699
So I think everyone's figured
out now how to play this game,

01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:40.409
is that right?
Has everyone figured it out?

01:03:40.409 --> 01:03:43.818
Let me take one of these mikes
and go down and just to make

01:03:43.818 --> 01:03:45.438
sure.
Lot's of people have figured

01:03:45.438 --> 01:03:48.596
this out.
So what is the rule for how to

01:03:48.596 --> 01:03:52.057
play this game?
What's the rule for how to play

01:03:52.057 --> 01:03:53.975
this game?
People haven't figured it out,

01:03:53.975 --> 01:03:57.210
we should play again.
So let's try over here,

01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:02.730
someone has an answer,
how should you play this game?

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.231
Student: It depends on
whether the piles have the same

01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:07.452
number in them.
If they have the same number

01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:10.423
you want to be second player,
and if they have different

01:04:10.423 --> 01:04:12.530
numbers you want to be first
player.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.440
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, what should you do?

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.785
Student: You want to --
Professor Ben Polak:

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:16.800
Let's assume they have different
numbers.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.570
Student: If they have
different numbers you want to

01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:20.104
make them equal.
Professor Ben Polak: You

01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:22.806
want to make them equal.
So the trick to playing this

01:04:22.806 --> 01:04:25.887
game is--thank you,
very good--so the trick to

01:04:25.887 --> 01:04:29.789
playing this game is if the
piles are uneven then you want

01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:33.350
to make them even--you want to
make them equal.

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:37.377
Everyone see that?
So if you start off with the

01:04:37.377 --> 01:04:43.557
piles being unequal as we did
both times, for example 3 and 2,

01:04:43.557 --> 01:04:49.624
then you want to be Player 1.
There's a first mover advantage

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:54.090
and the correct tactic is to
equalize the piles.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:58.139
What you'll notice now is that
player 2 can't do anything.

01:04:58.139 --> 01:05:00.758
If they take two from here,
you'll win by taking both of

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:03.141
those two.
If they take one from here

01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:07.948
you'll equalize the piles again.
And if they take then one from

01:05:07.948 --> 01:05:11.878
here you've won.
So the way to play this game is

01:05:11.878 --> 01:05:15.039
to equalize the piles.
What does that mean?

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:19.763
It means if the initial
position has unequal piles,

01:05:19.763 --> 01:05:23.920
uneven piles,
then you would rather be Player

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.510
1: it has a first mover
advantage.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:33.630
But if the initial position has
even numbers in the piles then

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:37.840
you'd rather be Player 2.
Is that right?

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.791
Because if you start off with
an even [correction:

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:44.130
equal]
number in each pile,

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.618
the person moving first is
going to make them unequal,

01:05:47.618 --> 01:05:51.369
and thereafter the next
person's in a winning position.

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:53.320
So I want us to notice two
things from this game.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:58.367
First notice in this game that
from any initial position we can

01:05:58.367 --> 01:06:03.660
very quickly tell who is going
to win and who is going to lose,

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:08.690
assuming they play well.
Three things actually.

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:12.096
Second, we didn't actually use
backward induction here,

01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:15.882
but it's pretty obvious you do
want to use backward induction

01:06:15.882 --> 01:06:18.294
here.
You want to figure out what the

01:06:18.294 --> 01:06:21.090
end game is going to look like,
is that right?

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:25.340
It's very easy to see this game
if you look at the end game.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.943
The third lesson is what we
just said, in this game,

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:33.252
sometimes there's a first mover
advantage, sometimes there's a

01:06:33.252 --> 01:06:36.713
second mover advantage.
So sometimes there's a first

01:06:36.713 --> 01:06:39.764
mover advantage in this game,
sometimes there's a second

01:06:39.764 --> 01:06:42.780
mover advantage in this game.
So I'm just illustrating the

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.395
point we made earlier that it's
not always the case that you

01:06:45.395 --> 01:06:47.241
want to move first.
Sometimes you want to move

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.463
second.
Now today I set up the piles

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:53.510
with unequal piles so there' was
a first mover advantage,

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.090
but that was just to give an
advantage to the guy whose

01:06:56.090 --> 01:07:00.067
birthday it was.
I could have set things up with

01:07:00.067 --> 01:07:05.094
equal lines in each pile,
and made the other guy go

01:07:05.094 --> 01:07:06.094
first.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:09.471
Professor Robert Shiller:
Today's lecture is about

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:17.925
behavioral finance and this is a
term that emerged into public

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:23.330
consciousness around the
mid-1990s;

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.797
before that it was unknown.
The term "efficient markets" is

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:30.778
much older;
I mentioned the idea goes back

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:35.080
to the nineteenth century and
the term goes back to the 1960s.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.897
But behavioral finance is a
newer revolution in finance and

00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:44.300
it's something that I have been
very involved with.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.587
I have been organizing
workshops in behavioral finance

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:52.308
ever since 1991,
working with Professor Richard

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:56.799
Thaler at University of Chicago.
We've been doing that for

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.338
eighteen years;
amazing, that's a long time for

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:03.398
you, right?
When we started we were total

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:08.159
outcasts, we thought;
nobody appreciated us.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.719
I had tenure so I could do it
but the problem is,

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.019
you don't want to do things
that are too out of fashion.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.491
Fortunately,
we have a system that allows it

00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:21.019
to happen and I'm very happy to
have that.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:26.779
What behavioral finance is a
reaction against extreme--some

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:32.339
extremes--that we see in
efficient markets theory or also

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:37.154
in mathematical finance.
Mathematical finance is a

00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:42.119
beautiful structure and I admire
what the people have done and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.269
I've worked in it myself,
but it has its limits.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.210
Eventually--you know the way a
paradigm develops--it goes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.970
through a certain phase.
When mathematical finance was

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.364
new, say in the 1960s,
it was the exciting thing and

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.159
nobody wanted to work on
anything else;

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.189
you wanted to be doing the
exciting thing.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.892
As the '70s and '80s wore on,
it got to be a little bit

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:09.383
overdone;
people run with it too far,

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:12.563
they think that's all we want
to do, and we don't want to

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.424
think about anything else.
Then they start to get

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:20.057
sometimes a little crazy.
Than we had to reflect that,

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:26.526
well, things aren't perfect.
The world isn't perfect and we

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:32.732
have real people in the world,
so that led to the behavioral

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:35.885
finance.
Behavioral finance really

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.860
means--what does it mean?
It's not like behavioral

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.132
psychology.
It doesn't mean behavioral

00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:45.117
psychology applied to finance.
It really means something much

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:47.916
more broad than that.
It means all of the other

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.460
social sciences applied to
finance.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.424
The economics department is
just one of many departments in

00:02:57.424 --> 00:03:04.149
the university that teaches us
something about how people

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.616
behave,
so if we want to understand how

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:11.909
people behave we can't rely only
on the economics department.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.878
I think that it's coming around
to a unifying of our

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:17.754
understanding.
Since then--since the

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:21.921
beginnings in the '90s,
our behavioral finance

00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:25.439
workshops have grown and grown
and,

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.020
of course, so many people are
involved in it now;

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.907
it's now very well-established.
Before I get into that,

00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:36.879
I want to give some additional
reflections on the last lecture.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.948
I have this chart,
which you saw last

00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:47.615
time--actually it's an Excel
spreadsheet that--I also put it

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:54.960
up already on the classes V2
website so you can play with it.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.430
I just want to reflect again--I
know I'm repeating myself a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.360
little bit, but it's very
important.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.857
What we have in this chart is
the blue line,

00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:14.633
which is the Standard &amp;
Poor Composite Stock Price

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:20.769
Index going back to 1871--from
1871 to 2008,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.330
right now--so that's like 130
years of data.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.388
That's the blue line.
You can see the--do you know

00:04:29.388 --> 00:04:34.110
what that is there?
That's 1929 and that is the

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.331
Crash of 1929.
Well, actually it extended to

00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:41.769
1932 and you can see other
historic movements.

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:47.636
There's the bull market of the
1990s--a very big upswing--and

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:51.839
then there's the crash from 2000
to 2003.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.799
I don't know if you remember
these things,

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:58.480
they were big news,
not as big as the 1929 crash,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.811
but the upswing was just as big
as the 1920s upswing,

00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:03.416
wasn't it?
Here's the 1920s upswing and

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:07.550
here's the 1990s upswing--huge
upswing in stock prices.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.405
This is in logs,
by the way, so that means that

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:18.315
everything--the same vertical
distance refers to the same

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:24.894
percentage change in the price.
Then I had, as I said last

00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:31.329
period, I have a random walk
shown--that's the pink line.

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:36.430
The random walk is generated by
the random number generator.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.004
I fixed the random number
generator, so I made it truly

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:42.819
normal this time.
It slows it down a little bit,

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.280
but if you press F9 we get
another random walk,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.160
but it's always the same stock
price.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.748
This is a random walk with a
trend that matches the uptrend

00:05:55.748 --> 00:06:01.678
of the stock price.
I can press--it kind of looks

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:06.793
similar, doesn't it?
It kind of shows that in some

00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:11.190
basic sense the stock market and
the random walk are the same.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.252
Here we have the crash of--here
we have the market peak of 1929

00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:23.360
except it turned out in this
simulation to have occurred in

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.579
1910 or thereabout.
Then we have the--that's The

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:29.360
Depression of the '30s except
it's not the '30s.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.340
I can just push a button and we
get something else.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.829
I find this amusing.
I don't know.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:40.204
Unfortunately,
we live through only one of

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:45.576
these in our lifetime.
There's a TV show about

00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:48.190
parallel universes,
right?

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.840
What's the name of that show?
I can't remember it.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.579
Don't you know this show?
Where they go in some kind of

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:57.999
time machine and they emerge in
another parallel universe where

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.556
history took another course.
Well anyway,

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:03.519
these are parallel universes
that we see.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:07.917
In some of these universes,
Jeremy Siegel would write his

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:10.980
book, Stocks for the Long
Run,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.256
and in some of them he would
not because–well,

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:17.982
this one he might not because
in this case the stock market

00:07:17.982 --> 00:07:21.579
was just declining for the
better part of a century.

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:26.338
The thing I don't see in these
charts and I think we haven't

00:07:26.338 --> 00:07:31.177
captured it perfectly with just
the standard random walk is I

00:07:31.177 --> 00:07:35.130
don't see any crash as big as
the 1929 crash.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.900
It's hard to get them.
I keep pushing F9--this just

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.389
seems to dominate,
right?

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.437
There's nothing as big
here--press F9 again--you can

00:07:45.437 --> 00:07:49.446
keep pushing and pushing,
maybe you'll get one but you

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:53.044
have--you get the idea that
there's something anomalous

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:56.710
about that crash from the
standpoint of this random walk

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.410
theory.
I'm not getting one, right?

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.819
That's something that we'll
talk about.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.699
I would--I'm not--I can push
for a long time and I don't

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:11.310
see--well there's a pretty big
one.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:16.956
Isn't that just about as--not
quite as sharp as the 1929

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:20.550
crash, but it's hard to get
them.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.663
I think that one
thing–there are a couple

00:08:23.663 --> 00:08:26.100
of things that we'll come back
to.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.480
One is--I think I've already
mentioned it--fat tales.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.731
Stock price movements have a
tendency to show some extreme

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:36.162
outliers that are not
represented by the normal

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:39.976
distribution.
But also, there are variations

00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:43.322
in the variance.
So, in this period here--in the

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.882
'20s and '30s--the stock market
was extremely variable on a

00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:49.762
day-to-day basis;
it was way beyond anything

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:53.257
we've observed since.
So, that's why it seems to be

00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:57.234
more volatile in that period
because the accumulation of

00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:02.149
bigger random shocks.
Anyway, we can play this game

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:08.837
for a while but now I want to go
and talk about--remember that

00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:15.635
the random walk that we see in
stock prices is not the behavior

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:18.937
of a drunk,
even though you can describe a

00:09:18.937 --> 00:09:23.272
random walk as drunken behavior.
The idea in the theory is that

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:28.361
these movements only appear
random because they're news and

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:33.085
news is always unpredictable.
If the market is doing the best

00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:36.052
job--this is efficient
markets--in predicting the

00:09:36.052 --> 00:09:39.301
future,
that means then that any time

00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:44.291
the stock market moves it's
because something surprising

00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:46.802
happened.
Like there might be a new

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.046
breakthrough in science or there
could be war or something

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.892
outside--this is the
story--outside of the economic

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:56.314
system that disrupts things.
The next question

00:09:56.314 --> 00:10:00.311
then–now,
I've added something--it's on

00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:05.853
this little tab here--I've added
something, which is a plot of

00:10:05.853 --> 00:10:10.070
present values.
This is something that I

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.175
published in 1981.
That's a long time ago,

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:17.509
isn't it?
It was my first big success.

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:20.696
Not everyone liked this
article, but what I had--I got

00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:24.600
into a lot of trouble for it.
I learned some people react

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.679
with hostility when you offend
their cherished beliefs,

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:32.759
so I was on the outs for a
while with this article.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:36.424
I said, it's kind of
interesting to think that all

00:10:36.424 --> 00:10:40.387
these apparently random
movements are really resulting

00:10:40.387 --> 00:10:44.425
in news about something that is
fundamental--that's the

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:48.411
efficient markets.
Every time the stock market

00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:52.550
moves it's because there was
some news about what?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.976
Well, it's about present value.
The efficient markets theory,

00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:58.948
in its simplest incarnation,
says that the price is the

00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:01.480
expected present value of future
dividends.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.518
What I did, in a paper that I
published in 1981,

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:08.461
is I said, well let's just plot
the present value of dividends

00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.648
through time.
That's how I constructed this

00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:15.409
long time series back to 1871;
nobody else was looking at it.

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:20.278
Typically, researchers want the
best data, the high quality

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:24.139
data, and so they would look at
recent data,

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:28.207
which was the best data,
and they would think going back

00:11:28.207 --> 00:11:31.610
to 1871 is crazy because that's
so long ago.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.500
We have daily or
minute-by-minute data by now,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.389
but we can't get it for that
remote period.

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:39.344
On the one hand,
as I argued,

00:11:39.344 --> 00:11:43.113
the stock market is pricing
things that occur over long

00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:46.580
periods of time.
The present value formula is

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.277
pricing dividends into the
future, decades into the

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.483
future--well,
actually to the infinite

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:55.000
future, but most of the weight
is on the next few decades.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.892
So, we can't evaluate the
theory by just looking at ten

00:11:57.892 --> 00:12:00.409
years of data we've got to get a
lot of data.

00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:04.320
What I did then in that paper
was I computed the actual

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.519
present value of subsequent
dividends for each year--that's

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:12.430
on this tab--and compared it
with the stock price;

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.889
so that's what I did.
This is an update of a plot

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:24.009
that I showed in my 1981
American Economic Review paper.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:27.430
The blue line--because when I
published it I was right here.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.710
It's amazing how time goes by;
it was 1979, I was right here.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:38.712
We had just come off from the
big stock market drop of the--it

00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:45.370
was the '73-'75 drop and it was
a couple of years later,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.419
so we were kind of bumbling
around down here.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:51.139
We didn't have any idea whether
this was coming at the time.

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:53.615
What I did was I just,
for each year,

00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:56.710
computed the present value of
the dividend.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.440
I have a dividend series for
every year.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.750
In fact, it's right over here.
I have to--this is the data,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:14.269
so I have the--this is the
S&amp;P Price Index monthly,

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:18.500
back to 1871,
and here are the dividends they

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.250
paid per share every year since
1871.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.533
I just, for each year,
I took all subsequent dividends

00:13:27.533 --> 00:13:33.514
and I priced them out at the
present value formula and I used

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:37.899
the constant discount rate of 6%
a year.

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:43.269
So, you see how we get what the
present value was.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:47.143
Of course, there's a problem
because we don't know dividends

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:51.279
after 2007 because we don't have
data on dividends past then.

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:54.425
But, I just made some
assumptions, so the value at the

00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:56.679
end is maybe a little bit
arbitrary.

00:13:56.679 --> 00:13:59.003
It could be dragged up or down
if I made a different assumption

00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:00.923
about dividends at the end.
More or less,

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.323
this is going to be what
actually the present value of

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:06.889
dividends was over this whole
period.

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:11.282
Here's the dilemma--this is
what I said in my 1981

00:14:11.282 --> 00:14:16.929
article--this is the thing that
is supposed to be forecasted.

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:21.195
That's the present value and
the blue line is the forecast of

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.211
that thing.
Then you ask,

00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:26.320
does this look like a good
forecast?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.820
Were people doing a good job of
forecasting the red line with

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.662
the blue line?
Now, that may be a loaded

00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:36.322
question;
but, I think that you get the

00:14:36.322 --> 00:14:39.911
impression that there's
something possibly wrong here

00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.985
with efficient markets because
the red line is just a smooth

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:48.265
growth path like nothing happens
to it and yet the stock market

00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:51.509
is going up and down all over
the place.

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:56.739
It's a little bit like if you
had a weather forecaster and

00:14:56.739 --> 00:15:01.379
this morning he says,
I predict today that the low

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:05.897
today will be -100º
and then two days later he

00:15:05.897 --> 00:15:08.720
says,
I predict that the low today

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.620
will be +150º.
You would eventually start

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.582
concluding that this weather
forecaster can't be trusted

00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:17.059
because we never get to those
temperatures.

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.940
That's sort of what the stock
market is doing;

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.860
it's fluctuating much more than
the thing that's forecasted.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.870
You've got to be careful;
I ended up with so many critics.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.356
There are lots of issues here
that--some people said,

00:15:30.356 --> 00:15:34.379
well people don't know where
the red line was last period.

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:38.701
And other people said,
well you just are showing one

00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:41.582
reality for the
realization--you're

00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:47.259
showing--they kind of get back
to this parallel universe story.

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:50.432
There must be another universe
where there's another Earth and

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:53.501
where everything looks the same
except that the red line did

00:15:53.501 --> 00:15:56.940
something very different;
that could be.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.028
So, people are saying,
you never know,

00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.075
there could have been a
communist revolution in America

00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:05.462
in the 1930s and they could have
nationalized the whole stock

00:16:05.462 --> 00:16:08.566
market and then the red line
would be down at zero--they

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:10.879
would have taken the whole
thing.

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:14.083
Or there could have been some
good news, some great

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:17.735
breakthrough that we haven't
discovered yet but in another

00:16:17.735 --> 00:16:21.147
reality they could have.
So, all this noise in the stock

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.172
market could have somehow been
new information about things

00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:28.579
that didn't happen.
I think we're getting kind of

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:32.399
philosophical when we go to
that.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:36.241
The point is that we've never
seen any movement in the present

00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:39.580
value of dividends that would
justify the movement.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.287
If we knew the future with
certainty, according to this

00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:45.246
model, then the stock market
would behave like the red line,

00:16:45.246 --> 00:16:46.600
not like the blue line.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.868
Well, anyway.
For example,

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:57.758
let's look at the Great
Depression of the 1930s,

00:16:57.758 --> 00:17:00.956
at the very least I think this
chart will reveal some

00:17:00.956 --> 00:17:03.539
misconceptions that some people
have.

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:07.055
The Great Depression of the
1930s was awful,

00:17:07.055 --> 00:17:09.010
right?
I mean you hear these stories;

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.221
I assume you hear these stories.
We had 25% unemployment at the

00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:17.335
peak--it sounds really bad.
We had people selling apples on

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:19.237
the street;
you must know these images,

00:17:19.237 --> 00:17:20.502
right?
It sounds awful,

00:17:20.502 --> 00:17:23.181
but look what happened to
p* in the Great

00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:26.009
Depression.
I can hardly see anything.

00:17:26.009 --> 00:17:29.506
Well, what actually happened
was businesses continued paying

00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:33.121
their dividends right through
the whole Depression and some of

00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:37.819
them cut their dividends,
but it was only for a few years.

00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:42.579
The present value of--the value
of stock depends on what it pays

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:45.450
out over decades not just next
year.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.036
The stock market--if people
knew the--even if they knew the

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:52.236
depression was coming,
they shouldn't have marked down

00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:54.950
the stock market so much,
according to this simple

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.608
efficient markets
story--according to the present

00:17:57.608 --> 00:18:00.287
value story.
At the very least,

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:06.370
I think that this diagram helps
you to see what is wrong or what

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.690
simple theories are wrong.
So, it must be that if the

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.963
stock market is reacting to new
information over all this

00:18:13.963 --> 00:18:16.356
century of history,
it must have been new

00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:18.990
information about things that
just didn't happen.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.834
It could be that an asteroid
almost struck the Earth and then

00:18:23.834 --> 00:18:27.789
it just missed and so the stock
market crashed.

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:30.125
Then when it missed it came
back up again,

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:32.859
so we don't see any
interruption in dividends.

00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:34.690
But it has to be something like
that.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.830
The problem is,
I can't think of anything like

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.500
that.
I don't think that any asteroid

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.759
came close to the Earth--not
close enough to be worried

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:49.199
about--and I can't think the
communist revolution had much

00:18:49.199 --> 00:18:52.518
chance of taking place in the
United States--but you can

00:18:52.518 --> 00:18:56.066
imagine--so we don't know.
Behavioral finance kind of

00:18:56.066 --> 00:18:59.597
tends to reach the opposite
conclusion: that this volatility

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.769
in the stock market is the sign
of something else;

00:19:02.769 --> 00:19:06.232
it's some social force,
some speculative bubbles,

00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:10.559
some activity that is not
related to anything fundamental.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:14.379
The reason I got so much
hostility when I wrote these

00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:16.950
papers is I was striking a
nerve,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.189
I guess, because many people
have developed these beautiful

00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:23.541
mathematical theories that said
that the stock market was the

00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:27.060
optimal predictor of everything
and I was saying the emperor has

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.380
no clothes;
so there were others like that.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.324
What is happening?
What I'm coming around to

00:19:34.324 --> 00:19:37.359
think--maybe it's my cynical
view, I've always been a cynic.

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:40.436
I don't know if you are cynics
or not, but I think people

00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:43.652
convinced themselves of things.
They--people think they

00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:46.029
understand things better than
they do.

00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:48.961
You spend your whole life
looking at this one picture of

00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:52.212
the stock market and you think
you have an explanation for all

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:55.463
of it--all rational good--but
it's just over-confidence that's

00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:57.390
doing that;
it's an illusion.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.555
I want to talk about
over-confidence and I thought

00:20:01.555 --> 00:20:04.870
I'd try–there's also no
eraser.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:23.588
Can you find another eraser?
There's probably one in this

00:20:23.588 --> 00:20:23.840
closet.

00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:35.786
I wanted to try an experiment
of asking you a series of a few

00:20:35.786 --> 00:20:39.170
short questions.
It's a game we'll play,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.630
which I'll need your
cooperation with.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.750
So, these are questions about
over-confidence.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:52.376
Actually, I just want you to
try to give me 90% confidence

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:57.839
intervals for the answers to
these questions.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.200
Do you know what a 90%
confidence interval is?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.965
It's, for example,
if I were to ask you what--how

00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:13.180
many people are there in New
Haven?

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.630
I want you to not just give me
a number, I want you to give me

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.569
a range such that you're 90%
sure that you're right.

00:21:21.569 --> 00:21:25.462
I could say,
well, it's between 90,000 and

00:21:25.462 --> 00:21:29.640
100,000 people and I'm 90% sure
I'm right.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.600
If you give me a true 90%
confidence interval,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.890
then you should be right 90% of
the time, right?

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.698
What I'm going to do is give
you a few questions and ask you

00:21:40.698 --> 00:21:45.344
for a 90--ask you to write
down--you have a piece of paper

00:21:45.344 --> 00:21:48.360
there--a 90% confidence
interval.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.920
I have five questions;
this is just an experiment.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.040
The first one is about the
Statue of Liberty.

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:07.370
What does it weigh in
pounds--in tons?

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:14.310
Good, thank you.
So, weight.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.503
Incidentally,
just to remind you,

00:22:21.503 --> 00:22:24.361
a U.S.
ton is 2,000 pounds--not a

00:22:24.361 --> 00:22:28.064
British pound,
which is 2,240 pounds--and a

00:22:28.064 --> 00:22:33.320
ton is 907 kilograms.
Can you write down on your

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.670
paper your 90% confidence
interval?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.190
For example,
I won't use realistic numbers.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.833
If you thought it was--you
might write down,

00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:47.398
it's between one pound and
three pounds and that you're 90%

00:22:47.398 --> 00:22:53.329
sure it falls in that interval.
I didn't say--its tons, tons.

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:56.548
I'm asking--it's more than a
pound--I'll give you a hint,

00:22:56.548 --> 00:22:58.558
it's in tons.
Let me also say,

00:22:58.558 --> 00:23:04.063
we're not weighing the base.
The Statue of Liberty stands on

00:23:04.063 --> 00:23:07.245
a tall edifice;
we're not counting that but

00:23:07.245 --> 00:23:10.338
we're counting also the steel
reinforcing that they put in a

00:23:10.338 --> 00:23:12.693
few years ago.
Remember, the Statue of Liberty

00:23:12.693 --> 00:23:15.431
was getting weak and they were
worried that something might

00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:17.804
topple down,
so they reinforced it and we're

00:23:17.804 --> 00:23:21.070
counting that.
So, it's a copper structure

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:26.039
with steel reinforcement.
Can you write down on your

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:31.740
notes a range within which
you're 90% sure that the statue

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.640
weighs, in tons?

00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:41.038
If you could do that--I'm going
to come back--what I'm going to

00:23:41.038 --> 00:23:43.338
do is come back and see how
often you are right so we'll go

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:45.586
back through these.
Have you all written down a

00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:47.320
weight for the Statute of
Liberty?

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:55.970
Population of the country,
Turkey.

00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:08.662
Since I don't have the current
population, I want it in the

00:24:08.662 --> 00:24:11.367
year 2000.
I didn't get the latest

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:15.131
estimate;
so, how many people were there

00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:19.707
in Turkey in 2000?
And again, put down a range,

00:24:19.707 --> 00:24:22.980
a low and a high,
that's 90% sure.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.670
Third, the Sahara Desert.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:42.640
How many square miles in the
Sahara Desert?

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.759
Remember that a square mile is
2.6 square kilometers;

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:49.436
just in case you think in terms
of kilometers,

00:24:49.436 --> 00:24:53.004
you can devise your answer in
kilometers and then multiply by

00:24:53.004 --> 00:24:57.540
2.6.
Again, write down a range.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.200
Enrollment at Yale.

00:25:07.329 --> 00:25:09.466
By the way, I should have
asked, you have to be honest

00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:12.034
with it.
You could game me by writing

00:25:12.034 --> 00:25:16.516
really wide intervals for nine
of ten questions and then an

00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:19.839
extremely narrow interval for
the tenth.

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:23.554
I'm expecting some sincere
cooperation here--then you would

00:25:23.554 --> 00:25:26.949
guarantee that you were right
exactly 90% of the time,

00:25:26.949 --> 00:25:29.241
right?
I mean, you could say the

00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:32.610
Statute of Liberty weighs
between zero and a hundred

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.650
quintillion tons and you know
you're right.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.771
Then you could deliberately say
the population of Turkey is

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:42.000
between one and two people and
then you know you're wrong.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.690
You could do--you're not
supposed to do that.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:50.127
I want the enrollment in Yale;
I don't have the latest

00:25:50.127 --> 00:25:53.478
number--2005.
That's the total number of

00:25:53.478 --> 00:25:58.218
students at Yale University in
2005, including Yale College and

00:25:58.218 --> 00:26:06.329
all the graduate schools.
The fifth question is about the

00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:09.410
Pulitzer Prize.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.636
Do you know this prize?
It's a prize that journalists

00:26:17.636 --> 00:26:21.009
win for writing great articles
or books.

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:23.919
I want to know,
what is--how much do you get in

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.260
cash if you win the Pulitzer
Prize?

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:33.267
I have it for last year, 2007;
it might be different in 2008,

00:26:33.267 --> 00:26:36.210
so I'm asking for the 2007,
in dollars.

00:26:42.509 --> 00:26:45.610
I hope you were honest in
putting confidence intervals.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.131
Have you gotten them?
Now, what I'm going to do,

00:26:49.131 --> 00:26:53.673
if you've answered all five
questions, I'm going to tell you

00:26:53.673 --> 00:26:57.907
the answers--the correct
answer--and then ask for a show

00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:03.220
of hands of how many--please be
honest and don't be embarrassed.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:09.769
Raise your hand if you were
right, meaning that if my answer

00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:15.319
falls within your 90% confidence
interval, okay?

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.880
Let's go to the Statue of
Liberty.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:24.450
The Statue of Liberty weighs
252 tons.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.432
So, can I have a show of
hands--how many people here have

00:27:29.432 --> 00:27:33.039
252 in the interval?
You're doing fairly well;

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:38.767
what fraction–keep your
hands up--looks like it's about,

00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:41.490
what would you say,
20-25%?

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.160
Thank you for being honest and
not gaming me.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.269
It should have been 90% who
were right.

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:54.769
What is the 2000 population of
Turkey?

00:27:54.769 --> 00:28:06.368
I'll give you the exact number
that I got from their statistic:

00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:11.427
65,666,677.
That's a little over sixty-five

00:28:11.427 --> 00:28:14.652
million.
How many people have that in

00:28:14.652 --> 00:28:17.550
their interval?
That's better;

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:23.835
that's like 40%--40% or 50%.
You're doing better but it's

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:26.885
still not 90%.
How many square miles in the

00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:29.410
Sahara Desert?
3.5 million.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:34.450
Can I get a show of hands--how
many were right on that?

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.970
Well, this one really got you,
that was like 5%.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.710
Was anyone right on all of them
so far?

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:48.550
Nobody.
Enrollment in Yale, Fall 2005?

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.700
11,483 students.
How many were right?

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.119
Okay, that's about 40%--right
close to 40%,

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:01.363
I'd say.
Finally, how much do you win

00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:05.480
if--how much do you receive if
you win the Pulitzer Prize?

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.579
$10,000.
Can I have a show of hands?

00:29:08.579 --> 00:29:12.769
That was really low,
that's like 5%.

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:14.804
I knew that was a trick because
you've heard about the Nobel

00:29:14.804 --> 00:29:16.835
Prize.
Those are both prestigious,

00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:19.038
right?
Nobel Prize gives you something

00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:22.311
on the order of $1,000,000 and
the Pulitzer Prize gives you

00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:24.850
something like--it only gives
you $10,000.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.839
So how can that be?
I sort of picked something that

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:31.176
I thought you might be wrong on.
That reveals something about

00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:35.029
human behavior.
It's a choice in life.

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:36.680
You go into different walks of
life.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.924
This is something that's
fundamental to economics:

00:29:38.924 --> 00:29:41.260
there are just different
expectations about how much

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.314
money you're going to make.
If you go into the news

00:29:44.314 --> 00:29:48.221
media--and I think that's a
wonderful career--you're not

00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.849
going to make much money
probably.

00:29:50.849 --> 00:29:54.774
The whole thing is just scaled
down and I think there's

00:29:54.774 --> 00:29:59.135
something revealing about this
that we just have social norms

00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:01.970
for how much someone is to be
paid.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.103
If you were to give Stephen
Schwartzman a $10,000 prize,

00:30:06.103 --> 00:30:09.710
it would be more like an insult
than anything.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.874
But if you are working for The
New Haven Register and you get

00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:16.720
this prize, it's a life-changing
event,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.834
not because of the $10,000
maybe--even they get more money

00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:22.887
than that.
Anyway, the point was that

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:26.927
people tend to be overconfident.
Incidentally,

00:30:26.927 --> 00:30:30.505
it's not just males;
females are well-known to be

00:30:30.505 --> 00:30:33.873
overconfident too.
There is a thing about macho

00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:37.723
males--"know it all"--but
experiments prove that women

00:30:37.723 --> 00:30:41.586
have the same problem.
That's why I think that when we

00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:45.281
look at charts of the stock
market, we see things that we

00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:48.450
think we understand,
especially young people.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.375
They get deluded into thinking
they understand more than they

00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:56.458
really do.
I wanted to talk about some

00:30:56.458 --> 00:31:02.690
authors that I admire who have
written about this.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:10.324
These are books that I don't
have on the reading list,

00:31:10.324 --> 00:31:16.413
but they're fun to read.
There's a professor at The

00:31:16.413 --> 00:31:20.109
Harvard Business School,
Rakesh Khurana;

00:31:20.109 --> 00:31:26.310
he has a book on the search for
charismatic CEOs.

00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:36.660
It's not just overconfidence in
yourself;

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.740
we tend also to put
overconfidence in leaders.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:45.157
We have a sense that some
people are just natural geniuses

00:31:45.157 --> 00:31:50.223
and know everything,
so we think that they can

00:31:50.223 --> 00:31:54.839
transform our lives or our
companies.

00:31:54.839 --> 00:31:58.816
So, boards of directors are
constantly looking for a CEO who

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:02.859
is a genius and they keep
getting fooled and disappointed.

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:06.358
They bring someone in and this
person often messes things up

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:09.797
more than helps because this
person realizes that he or she

00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:12.110
has to live up to this genius
role,

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.775
so they better do something.
So, they do something in a

00:32:14.775 --> 00:32:16.952
flailing way,
not understanding what they're

00:32:16.952 --> 00:32:19.230
doing, and they mess up the
whole company.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.517
Really, a lot of what
happens--good things that happen

00:32:22.517 --> 00:32:26.302
in human society--are the result
of lots of people doing their

00:32:26.302 --> 00:32:29.279
own special things and all
working together.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:34.838
There's no great genius but
there's this idea in our mind

00:32:34.838 --> 00:32:38.710
that we are going to be such a
thing.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:44.678
Related to that--and I wanted
to mention, it's on the reading

00:32:44.678 --> 00:32:49.851
list--an article by one of my
students in this class,

00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:55.618
who's now at MIT.
He took this class about ten

00:32:55.618 --> 00:33:02.712
years ago, Fadi Kanaan and
co-authored with another MIT

00:33:02.712 --> 00:33:06.202
professor,
Dirk Jenter,

00:33:06.202 --> 00:33:13.630
again looking at overconfidence
in our judgments.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:18.218
Again, they looked at CEOs,
chief executive officers of

00:33:18.218 --> 00:33:23.146
companies, and they found that
companies in industries that

00:33:23.146 --> 00:33:27.570
fail tend to fire their CEOs.
This is unjust;

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.164
this is an overreaction.
You bring in this CEO who's

00:33:31.164 --> 00:33:34.621
supposed to be brilliant and
then the business fails,

00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:37.279
so you fire the guy right after
that.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:40.920
We're kind of manic-depressive
about these guys.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.723
When the business fails,
we think we were such a

00:33:43.723 --> 00:33:45.754
mistake.
This guy had such promise and

00:33:45.754 --> 00:33:47.980
he just didn't live up so we get
rid of him;

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.991
but in fact,
they found that the CEO gets

00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:54.380
fired even if the whole industry
went down.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.483
So, you can't blame the CEO for
the fact--if you're one company

00:33:58.483 --> 00:34:02.057
in an industry and the whole
industry goes down--or the

00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:05.763
remaining industry even not
including that firm--it's not

00:34:05.763 --> 00:34:09.078
the CEO's fault.
We tend to be kind of wild and

00:34:09.078 --> 00:34:12.258
extreme in our judgments.
You've seen that a lot--a lot

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:15.340
of CEOs lost their jobs recently
in the subprime crisis.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.301
Was it their fault?
Probably not,

00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:22.001
but they get fired anyway.
We go through this

00:34:22.001 --> 00:34:25.733
manic-depressive--we try to hire
charismatic CEOs,

00:34:25.733 --> 00:34:30.074
then we get disappointed and we
keep going through musical

00:34:30.074 --> 00:34:34.033
chairs one after another.
Nassim Taleb,

00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:40.341
who lives here in Connecticut
and I know him well,

00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:46.650
has a book called Fooled by
Randomness,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:52.710
which was a best-seller and
it's very fun to read.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:58.004
It's a story--he's a Wall
Street--he had an investment

00:34:58.004 --> 00:35:03.000
management firm and he observed
a lot of people.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.859
It's a book about how people
over interpret--they tend to

00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:10.993
blame themselves for failures
and congratulate themselves for

00:35:10.993 --> 00:35:14.784
successes too much and they
don't realize that it's just

00:35:14.784 --> 00:35:17.080
random.
Some guy who's in a

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.177
business--business is
succeeding--why is it

00:35:20.177 --> 00:35:22.978
succeeding?
Because the guy came in,

00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:27.472
dumb luck at the right time and
everything is supporting that,

00:35:27.472 --> 00:35:33.995
concludes that he's a genius.
Then Taleb observes them later,

00:35:33.995 --> 00:35:42.460
after things don't go so well,
and suddenly they're depressed.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.276
– I talked to
stockbrokers before and after

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:48.738
the '87 stock market crash and
one of them told me--or maybe

00:35:48.738 --> 00:35:52.493
more than one of them told me--I
can tell that the crash occurred

00:35:52.493 --> 00:35:55.838
from the tone of voice of the
people when they call up the

00:35:55.838 --> 00:35:58.230
phone.
When the market was soaring

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.428
just before the '87 peak,
he said they would call up and

00:36:01.428 --> 00:36:04.510
they were brash and rude to me
and they would say,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.197
let's trade this,
get this done--kind of just

00:36:08.197 --> 00:36:11.550
disparaging subtlety,
the stockbroker.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.886
Then after the crash,
when these people were sort

00:36:13.886 --> 00:36:16.612
of--many of them--wiped out,
they'd answer the phone in a

00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:18.533
sheepish way.
You could just tell in the tone

00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:19.910
of their voice that they were
crushed.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:26.182
So, that's what happens.
I also have down on this part

00:36:26.182 --> 00:36:32.559
of the reading list Irving
Fisher, who was a professor at

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:36.124
Yale,
who was a very prominent

00:36:36.124 --> 00:36:40.989
economist in the first half of
the century.

00:36:40.989 --> 00:36:44.875
He's another Yale graduate,
Yale Class of 1895,

00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:47.335
I think.
I'm sure he lectured on this

00:36:47.335 --> 00:36:50.452
stage because this building
was--his office was in this

00:36:50.452 --> 00:36:53.836
building, I believe.
He died around the mid-1940s

00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:56.480
but he's famous for
overconfidence.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.798
In 1929, he was interviewed
just before--two weeks

00:37:00.798 --> 00:37:06.349
before--the 1929 peak and--do
you know what I'm referring to?

00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:11.264
He said he thought the stock
market was on a permanently high

00:37:11.264 --> 00:37:16.097
plateau and he wrote a book in
1929--actually it came out in

00:37:16.097 --> 00:37:20.275
1930--with this extremely
optimistic outlook for the

00:37:20.275 --> 00:37:24.929
market.
He had a beautiful mansion;

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:27.857
he was a wealthy man for a
while, but he lost everything in

00:37:27.857 --> 00:37:30.902
the stock market crash.
In fact he had to--he had

00:37:30.902 --> 00:37:34.255
borrowed against his home and he
lost his house,

00:37:34.255 --> 00:37:38.534
so Yale University bought his
house for him and rented it out

00:37:38.534 --> 00:37:40.816
to him;
otherwise, he would be on the

00:37:40.816 --> 00:37:43.830
street.
I have an article written by

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.135
him in 1930--I think it's 1930
or at the end of

00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:52.160
1929--discussing the stock
market crash.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.404
He still is unrepentant.
This was our most brilliant

00:37:56.404 --> 00:37:59.245
professor here at Yale,
but he just totally misjudged

00:37:59.245 --> 00:38:00.994
the market,
He's just totally

00:38:00.994 --> 00:38:03.659
unrepentant--he just went back
over his book.

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:06.629
There are so many good
reasons--the 20s were a

00:38:06.629 --> 00:38:10.456
spectacular era--so many good
reasons the stock market will

00:38:10.456 --> 00:38:13.690
keep going up and he just
wouldn't back down.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.608
In fact, what he actually did
was he started borrowing from

00:38:16.608 --> 00:38:19.527
his relatives--he had wealthy
relatives--and he lost all of

00:38:19.527 --> 00:38:21.674
it.
He just couldn't have imagined

00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:25.262
that the stock market would go
down--there was just no reason

00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:28.432
that he could think of--and
that's what he says in the

00:38:28.432 --> 00:38:32.693
article.
Anyway, I want to talk more

00:38:32.693 --> 00:38:37.210
precisely about how people
behave;

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.959
this is all general about
overconfidence,

00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:46.489
but there's some other factors
that I want to start with.

00:38:46.489 --> 00:38:53.702
The most important theory in
behavioral finance is the

00:38:53.702 --> 00:38:59.010
Kahneman and Tversky Prospect
Theory.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.078
Danny Kahneman,
who is now a professor of

00:39:06.078 --> 00:39:10.510
psychology at Princeton,
and Amos Tversky,

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:16.824
who died a few years ago--they
wrote, I think,

00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:23.840
the most famous article on
behavioral economics;

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.860
it goes beyond just finance.
The title of the article was

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:38.630
Prospect Theory and that
was 1979.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.671
This is, I think,
the–actually,

00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:44.017
I think there was a ranking of
economics articles--scholarly

00:39:44.017 --> 00:39:47.023
articles--by numbers of
quotations and this was number

00:39:47.023 --> 00:39:50.539
two out of all articles written
in the last fifty years.

00:39:50.539 --> 00:39:54.270
Number one, it was quoted for
some other reason--I'm not

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:58.340
sure--it was some statistical
method that everyone quoted.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.696
In terms of an intellectual
contribution,

00:40:00.696 --> 00:40:03.937
this is the most important
economics article in the last

00:40:03.937 --> 00:40:06.505
fifty years,
at least judged by how many

00:40:06.505 --> 00:40:09.547
times it's cited.
Kahneman and Tversky are not

00:40:09.547 --> 00:40:12.974
really talking about
overconfidence but something,

00:40:12.974 --> 00:40:16.820
well, perhaps related to
it--something more general.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.074
It's how people make choices
and there are two elements to

00:40:21.074 --> 00:40:28.643
this theory.
It replaces expected utility

00:40:28.643 --> 00:40:39.826
and it has--what it does,
it replaces the utility

00:40:39.826 --> 00:40:49.378
function with a value
function--with value

00:40:49.378 --> 00:41:01.260
function--and replaces the
probabilities with,

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.678
what they call, weights.
I'm going to explain what that

00:41:06.678 --> 00:41:11.496
is and we'll move on.
Let me give a little story that

00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:15.998
leads up to it and it's a story
that Paul Samuelson,

00:41:15.998 --> 00:41:19.000
who's a professor at MIT,
told.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.402
Paul Samuelson was a highly
esteemed--he is--I think he's

00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:30.287
ninety-two or about ninety-two
years old now and still writing

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:34.761
and still working.
He was a--he is a mathematical

00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:38.445
economist, retired now,
but he told a story that

00:41:38.445 --> 00:41:43.070
illustrates some of the
beginnings of Prospect--in fact,

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.769
he kind of anticipated Prospect
Theory.

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:49.889
This goes back to an article
that he wrote in 1963.

00:41:49.889 --> 00:41:56.313
In 1963, he was having lunch
with one of his colleagues,

00:41:56.313 --> 00:42:00.098
another economist;
he doesn't name this other

00:42:00.098 --> 00:42:02.270
person because it would be
embarrassing,

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.780
but everyone knows it was E.
Cary Brown, a professor at MIT.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.224
Samuelson, in a playful
mood--he was always sort of a

00:42:10.224 --> 00:42:13.727
playful person--he said at
lunch--he said,

00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:18.103
hey let's toss a coin.
Let's make a bet just for the

00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:22.113
fun of it and if it comes up
heads, I'll give you $200,

00:42:22.113 --> 00:42:25.530
but if it comes up tails,
you give me $100.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.901
He said, let's do it I'm ready.
This kind of took E.

00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:33.981
Cary Brown by surprise.
That sounds like a lot of

00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:38.193
money, especially in 1963;
prices were much lower--that's

00:42:38.193 --> 00:42:41.639
like $1,000 or $2000.
It was big money.

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:43.422
But of course,
these professors could afford

00:42:43.422 --> 00:42:46.179
it;
it's not that much money.

00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:48.869
So, let's just say it's $100
and $200.

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:51.887
Do you feel like--if I were to
offer that to you right

00:42:51.887 --> 00:42:55.190
now--let's do it because you
don't have cash on you now,

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.880
but you'd have to promise to
pay me if you came out wrong.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.055
Do you feel like doing that?
No, someone is answering me

00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:05.820
honestly.
Introspect and think about it

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.139
while this is suddenly thrust on
you.

00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:09.579
E.
Cary Brown said,

00:43:09.579 --> 00:43:13.659
come on I don't want to do
this--Samuelson was being

00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:17.563
annoying by doing this.
Then Samuelson thought--had

00:43:17.563 --> 00:43:20.728
another idea-he said,
what if I offered--he didn't

00:43:20.728 --> 00:43:24.539
actually offer this--what if I
offered to--let's do this 100

00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:27.539
times.
We'll toss a coin 100 times and

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:31.895
each time it comes up heads I
give you $200 and each time it

00:43:31.895 --> 00:43:34.933
comes up tails you give me $100.
Well, E.

00:43:34.933 --> 00:43:38.276
Cary Brown, knowing mathematics
of statistics and the law of

00:43:38.276 --> 00:43:39.750
probabilities,
he said,

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.768
well, if we do it 100 times,
by the binomial theorem,

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:46.933
I'm sure to win.
I couldn't possibly--this is

00:43:46.933 --> 00:43:49.530
elementary--100 times is a lot
of times.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.659
In fact, I'll make thousands of
dollars.

00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:53.118
So, E.
Cary Brown said,

00:43:53.118 --> 00:43:54.905
I'll do it.
I would do it,

00:43:54.905 --> 00:43:59.119
but he didn't actually do it.
Samuelson then said--he went

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:03.579
back to his office and he wrote
a paper--that's this 1963

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:07.719
paper--proving that E.
Cary Brown was irrational.

00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:10.900
You cannot possibly say,
I will take 100 of them but I

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.030
won't take one of them.
That's not rational.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:18.289
That was one of the motivating
things in Kahneman and Tversky.

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:22.490
What Kahneman and Tversky said
is that people behave--if you

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.620
can introspect and imagine why
some of you didn't feel like

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.963
taking this bet--people behave
as if they have a kink in their

00:44:30.963 --> 00:44:34.558
utility.
This may sound an abstract way

00:44:34.558 --> 00:44:37.503
of putting it,
but expected utility

00:44:37.503 --> 00:44:42.267
theory--the traditional theory
says that everybody has a

00:44:42.267 --> 00:44:46.771
utility function that they
consistently refer to when

00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:51.362
making calculations.
I'm going to put Kahneman and

00:44:51.362 --> 00:44:56.100
Tversky over here and I'm going
to put Expected Utility Theory

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.110
over here.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:07.870
Expected Utility Theory says
that I want wealth--and I'll

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:12.698
call w wealth--and I get
utility from wealth--that's

00:45:12.698 --> 00:45:16.062
U.
My utility curve--it has maybe

00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:19.789
any number of shapes,
but its concave downward and

00:45:19.789 --> 00:45:23.821
smooth, so you have what's
called diminishing marginal

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.810
utility;

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.952
that's Expected Utility Theory.
What Expected Utility Theory

00:45:37.952 --> 00:45:41.019
means--the slope is always
decreasing.

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:43.949
Every extra dollar of wealth
gives me less happiness but it

00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:46.880
always give me a little bit
more, so I always want more.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.669
Expected Utility Theory would
say that that's a two-for-one

00:45:50.669 --> 00:45:54.523
bet that Samuelson is offering
and it's small compared to my

00:45:54.523 --> 00:45:58.495
lifetime wealth.
My utility is essentially

00:45:58.495 --> 00:46:04.359
linear over the relevant range,
plus $200 or minus $100,

00:46:04.359 --> 00:46:09.369
so I don't really concern
myself about risk.

00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:12.110
I should just take every bet
like that all the time.

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.822
You should always be
looking--if you are behaving

00:46:14.822 --> 00:46:17.139
this way--you should always be
looking.

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:19.476
Anyone who wants to make a bet
with me anytime,

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:22.574
I'll always take it if it's in
my advantage--even a little bit

00:46:22.574 --> 00:46:25.793
in my advantage.
People seem to like to gamble

00:46:25.793 --> 00:46:29.059
but they don't like to do it
consistently.

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:32.655
They like to go to--they end up
going to gambling casinos where

00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:35.387
it's stacked against them,
not for them,

00:46:35.387 --> 00:46:39.389
but it's somehow arranged as an
entertainment.

00:46:39.389 --> 00:46:45.236
Well, Kahneman and Tversky said
that people don't behave this

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:51.180
way and it's as if they have a
value function as a function of

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.148
their money.
Let's put in the middle of the

00:46:55.148 --> 00:46:58.119
value function,
the reference point.

00:46:58.119 --> 00:47:04.062
Reference point means where you
are today and your value--that's

00:47:04.062 --> 00:47:08.532
V, which is like utility,
but now we're talking in

00:47:08.532 --> 00:47:11.320
psychological terms,
so we give it a different name.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:17.674
The value function has a kink;
it's something like that at the

00:47:17.674 --> 00:47:21.478
reference point.
I'm trying to draw it--it's not

00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:26.139
necessarily--it looks here like
two straight lines and that's

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:30.169
not quite the way to do it.
Let me try and do this

00:47:30.169 --> 00:47:34.805
again--it's curved downward a
little bit, but it becomes much

00:47:34.805 --> 00:47:38.823
less--I don't--I'm having
trouble drawing this on the

00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:41.757
board well.
I don't want to ever--kind of

00:47:41.757 --> 00:47:44.537
going down.
There's a kink here,

00:47:44.537 --> 00:47:49.940
where the slope--I think I've
got it sort of there.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.433
It's concave down everywhere,
just like the utility function

00:47:53.433 --> 00:47:56.630
is, but there's a discontinuity
of slope right here.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.659
Where is that?
That's where I am now.

00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:06.098
What it means is that I value
losses much more than I value

00:48:06.098 --> 00:48:10.295
gains from wherever I am.
There's a big difference

00:48:10.295 --> 00:48:14.183
between losing and winning,
so when I reflect on this bet

00:48:14.183 --> 00:48:18.139
I'm thinking of--I could lose
$100 and that scares me.

00:48:18.139 --> 00:48:21.329
It feels bad--the idea that--I
would just feel bad.

00:48:21.329 --> 00:48:26.499
So gaining $200 is positive for
me but it doesn't offset the

00:48:26.499 --> 00:48:30.102
loss that I might make.
So, if I have equal

00:48:30.102 --> 00:48:33.297
probabilities,
what you want to do is weight

00:48:33.297 --> 00:48:37.460
the gains and losses and the
losses tend to dominate,

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.260
so you don't want to take the
bet.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.438
The weighting function
incorporates Samuelson's lunch

00:48:43.438 --> 00:48:47.456
colleague's problem:
that people don't want to take

00:48:47.456 --> 00:48:50.429
bets that are to their
advantage.

00:48:50.429 --> 00:48:53.500
It goes back to a kink in the
utility function.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.013
Now, incidentally,
this is fundamentally different

00:48:56.013 --> 00:48:58.372
from--in economic theory,
economists would say,

00:48:58.372 --> 00:49:01.039
well you can put a kink in the
utility function.

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:03.780
There could be some wealth
level that's special to you.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.192
But a theory economist--that
kink has to stay at a certain

00:49:07.192 --> 00:49:10.027
wealth level.
With Kahneman and Tversky,

00:49:10.027 --> 00:49:13.677
this kink moves around with
you, so whatever--it's

00:49:13.677 --> 00:49:18.519
whatever--you're always at the
kink because it's not rational;

00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:20.789
this is not rational Expected
Utility Theory.

00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:24.844
This is--I'm always looking at
where I am now and exaggerating

00:49:24.844 --> 00:49:28.300
in my mind the importance of
deviations from that.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.199
People are very concerned with
small losses;

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:36.710
that's what th kink in the
value function is.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:40.627
Now, I want to talk about
another Kahneman and Tversky

00:49:40.627 --> 00:49:43.510
thing, called the weighting
function.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:51.230
The weighting function refers
to the fact that people distort

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:55.090
probabilities in their mind.

00:50:06.699 --> 00:50:12.866
It's not that they don't know
probabilities but they distort

00:50:12.866 --> 00:50:17.249
them in their thinking.
I'll give an example that

00:50:17.249 --> 00:50:21.637
illustrates the Kahneman-Tversky
weighting function and it goes

00:50:21.637 --> 00:50:24.610
back years before Kahneman and
Tversky.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:29.895
It's a famous example from a
French economist,

00:50:29.895 --> 00:50:34.710
Maurice Allais,
and it's called the Allais

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:40.021
Paradox.
It illustrates thinking that

00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:44.760
violates Expected Utility
Theory.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.917
I'm going to give you a choice
between two "prospects," as

00:50:48.917 --> 00:50:51.469
Kahneman and Tversky called
them.

00:50:51.469 --> 00:51:08.251
Suppose I offered you a 25%
chance to win $3,000 or,

00:51:08.251 --> 00:51:22.730
alternatively,
a 20% chance to win $4,000.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.713
Maybe I can get a show of hands.
This is like Samuelson's lunch

00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:37.000
colleague again,
but a little different.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.459
Suppose I'm offering--I'm not
offering this,

00:51:39.459 --> 00:51:42.947
but suppose I offered this--you
have a choice between Prospect

00:51:42.947 --> 00:51:46.703
One or Prospect Two.
Prospect One--I'm going to toss

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:51.085
a four-sided coin and if it
comes up with a probability of

00:51:51.085 --> 00:51:55.159
one-fourth, in a certain way,
you will win $3,000.

00:51:55.159 --> 00:52:00.193
In Prospect Two,
I'm going to give you a chance

00:52:00.193 --> 00:52:04.441
of 20% to win $4,000.
Can you tell me which of these

00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:07.270
you'd pick if you had to pick
only one of these?

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:13.390
Do you understand the question?
How many would pick number One?

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:20.139
It seems like it's about 20%.
How many would pick number Two?

00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:21.969
So, most of you would pick
number Two.

00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:26.829
Now, let's do a variation on
this question here--a very

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:31.559
simple variation.
Which would you prefer?

00:52:31.559 --> 00:52:36.309
This is the one that you
picked--most people picked.

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:48.682
Another prospect--100% chance
of winning $3,000--or Two,

00:52:48.682 --> 00:52:59.480
that would be an 80% chance of
winning $4,000.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.230
Do you see the--if you pick
Prospect One,

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.789
you're going to just get $3,000
for sure.

00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:13.318
If you pick Prospect Two,
you'll probably get $4,000 but

00:53:13.318 --> 00:53:16.659
an 80% chance of it.
How many would pick One?

00:53:16.659 --> 00:53:20.040
That looks like the--how many
would pick Two?

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.093
Very few of you would pick Two.
Have to reflect--so we picked

00:53:25.093 --> 00:53:27.946
One this time.
Now, you might want to reflect

00:53:27.946 --> 00:53:29.494
on that.
Why was it such a

00:53:29.494 --> 00:53:33.432
different--why did you pick One
in this case and pick Two in

00:53:33.432 --> 00:53:36.161
this case?
The thing I want to point out

00:53:36.161 --> 00:53:39.949
is that the number--the cash
amounts are the same in the two

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:43.929
examples but the probabilities
are just multiplied by four.

00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:50.294
So the expected utility of the
two is just four times as great,

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:55.696
no matter what.
They're the same--the utilities

00:53:55.696 --> 00:54:00.059
are the same,
with the same numbers.

00:54:00.059 --> 00:54:04.353
All I've done is multiply your
expected utility by four in this

00:54:04.353 --> 00:54:07.469
case, so you can't make a
different choice.

00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:11.477
If you picked Two over here
when comparing these two

00:54:11.477 --> 00:54:16.034
prospects you should also have
picked Two when you compared

00:54:16.034 --> 00:54:19.390
these two prospects.
Why didn't you?

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:24.090
Most of you switched.
Can you tell me why?

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:28.604
Yes.
Student: I would prefer

00:54:28.604 --> 00:54:31.298
not to gamble,
so if I had the chance a--in

00:54:31.298 --> 00:54:34.570
the first situation,
I would take the chance to make

00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:36.132
$4,000.
Professor Robert

00:54:36.132 --> 00:54:38.010
Shiller: You would choose
not to gamble.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.689
Does this mean it's like a
moral judgment or--

00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:43.130
Student: No,
I prefer certainty.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:44.137
Professor Robert
Shiller: Okay,

00:54:44.137 --> 00:54:45.896
you got it exactly.
That's yeah--you got--you

00:54:45.896 --> 00:54:50.121
prefer certainty.
There's some anxiety about

00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:57.556
maybe--you got it exactly right.
I think people like certainty

00:54:57.556 --> 00:55:03.000
and ambiguity is difficult for
them to adjust to.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.009
Kahneman and Tversky put it in
this following way:

00:55:07.009 --> 00:55:10.199
it's a little bit like we're
cavemen.

00:55:10.199 --> 00:55:13.309
It turns out,
we were all taught to count and

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:17.621
to do arithmetic but primitive
people actually have difficulty

00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:20.426
counting.
There's an old story that

00:55:20.426 --> 00:55:24.349
cavemen had only three numbers:
one, two, and many.

00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:27.591
I used to disbelieve this story
but I'm not--actually it was a

00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:29.769
psychologist at Princeton told
me that,

00:55:29.769 --> 00:55:33.004
as a matter of fact,
it's proven that there are some

00:55:33.004 --> 00:55:35.922
people whose languages have only
those numbers:

00:55:35.922 --> 00:55:38.280
one,
two, and many.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.183
For example,
they're called--in Laos in

00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:45.309
Thailand, there's a very
primitive group of people with

00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:48.670
primitive technology.
I don't mean that they're

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.223
primitive people but they only
have one, two,

00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:53.049
and many;
and there are others that have

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:56.719
been discovered.
Emotionally we're like that.

00:55:56.719 --> 00:55:59.643
I used to wonder how could they
have only those numbers:

00:55:59.643 --> 00:56:01.829
one, two, and many.
You ask a mother,

00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:05.119
how many children do you have?
She couldn't answer;

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:08.920
she didn't have the word three,
but as a matter of fact they

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.284
didn't.
So I guess, if you asked the

00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.981
mother, how many children you
have, she would probably just

00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:16.574
name them.
She couldn't say,

00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:19.680
I have three children.
But anyway, we're all kind of

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.750
like that when we think about
probability;

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:26.039
that's Kahneman and Tversky.
Kahneman and Tversky say what

00:56:26.039 --> 00:56:30.157
we do is that in our minds we
weight the probabilities in a

00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:33.849
distorted way and this is the
weighting function.

00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:38.170
So, we have the weight--that's
weight not wealth here--against

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:42.349
the probability and I'm going to
exaggerate a little bit.

00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:47.685
This is zero and this is one
because probabilities range from

00:56:47.685 --> 00:56:51.058
zero to one.
The weighting function looks

00:56:51.058 --> 00:56:55.163
like this--I'm exaggerating a
little bit so you can see

00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:59.040
but--and then it jumps up or it
jumps down here;

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.455
this is the idea.
What Kahneman and Tversky said

00:57:03.455 --> 00:57:07.774
in their original 1979 article
is, we act as--there's a wide

00:57:07.774 --> 00:57:12.385
range of probabilities here that
are all kind of blurred and put

00:57:12.385 --> 00:57:14.117
together.
We minimize

00:57:14.117 --> 00:57:16.946
and–emotionally,
the difference between

00:57:16.946 --> 00:57:20.289
probabilities--they're all kind
of in the middle.

00:57:20.289 --> 00:57:23.218
So, when I said twenty or
twenty-five, in your mind you

00:57:23.218 --> 00:57:26.419
said, here's twenty and here's
twenty-five but I don't think

00:57:26.419 --> 00:57:28.860
they're much different to me
emotionally.

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.449
The money sounds different but
the probability sounds the same.

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:35.470
It's like I have only three
probabilities:

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.386
can't happen,
might happen,

00:57:37.386 --> 00:57:41.544
and it's certain to happen.
You tend to be totally in to

00:57:41.544 --> 00:57:44.490
the certainty story,
so you give it much more

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:49.264
weight.
The way--what people do then,

00:57:49.264 --> 00:57:57.047
summing up--in expected utility
theory, you maximize the

00:57:57.047 --> 00:58:02.850
probability-weighted sum of
utilities.

00:58:10.969 --> 00:58:15.257
You maximize the summation of
the probability of the

00:58:15.257 --> 00:58:19.881
i^(th) outcome times
utility in the i^(th)

00:58:19.881 --> 00:58:25.262
outcome.
But in Prospect Theory,

00:58:25.262 --> 00:58:34.767
you maximize the sum of the
weights times the value

00:58:34.767 --> 00:58:42.347
function--the values.
This is the Kahneman and

00:58:42.347 --> 00:58:48.130
Tversky variation on Expected
Utility Theory.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:53.448
There's something related to it
that psychologists talk about,

00:58:53.448 --> 00:58:58.533
it's called Regret Theory.
It's a little bit different but

00:58:58.533 --> 00:59:01.859
it's essentially the same
as–well,

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:05.269
it's consistent with Prospect
Theory.

00:59:05.269 --> 00:59:09.452
That is, people experience pain
of regret and they do a lot of

00:59:09.452 --> 00:59:12.469
things to try to avoid the pain
of regret.

00:59:12.469 --> 00:59:15.535
For example,
when the stock market goes up

00:59:15.535 --> 00:59:19.722
they try to sell it and lock in
the gain because they are

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:23.759
worried that if it goes down
again they will regret not

00:59:23.759 --> 00:59:26.676
having sold it;
that's not a rational

00:59:26.676 --> 00:59:29.342
calculation.
If you come to something,

00:59:29.342 --> 00:59:33.519
you just have it and then it
escapes you, you feel pain.

00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:37.206
I guess that's what happened at
the Super Bowl last night when

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:40.832
the New England Patriots had a
winning streak and they messed

00:59:40.832 --> 00:59:44.337
up at the very end--that's
exceptionally painful and that's

00:59:44.337 --> 00:59:47.655
part of Regret Theory.
I don't know how pained any of

00:59:47.655 --> 00:59:50.579
you are but it must have been
painful to them anyway.

00:59:50.579 --> 00:59:58.783
I just mentioned some other
things that are related to

00:59:58.783 --> 01:00:06.081
Prospect Theory.
There's something called

01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:16.796
"mental compartments" that
people--Expected Utility Theory

01:00:16.796 --> 01:00:20.248
says,
your utility depends on your

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:23.380
whole lifetime wealth,
so you should be always

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.557
thinking that everything that
happens today is just part of a

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:31.013
bigger story;
I'm always thinking about my

01:00:31.013 --> 01:00:33.617
lifetime.
I had you do an exercise at the

01:00:33.617 --> 01:00:37.075
beginning where I asked you to
estimate the present value of

01:00:37.075 --> 01:00:40.299
your lifetime income and it
probably came out to several

01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:43.103
million dollars.
So, if you were behaving

01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:47.170
rationally you would always be
weighing things against that big

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:51.026
sum of several million dollars.
That's why plus $100,

01:00:51.026 --> 01:00:53.349
minus $200--who cares,
right?

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:57.021
That's the way you should be
thinking but you don't think

01:00:57.021 --> 01:01:00.937
that way because you're human.
People put things in mental

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:03.764
compartments,
all different compartments in

01:01:03.764 --> 01:01:06.149
your mind,
and you have separate values

01:01:06.149 --> 01:01:09.059
for things depending on which
compartment they're in.

01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:11.598
For example,
when you go to the gambling

01:01:11.598 --> 01:01:15.440
casino, the winnings and losses
are completely different.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.951
You just put them in a game
compartment and you think,

01:01:17.951 --> 01:01:19.989
I can accept these and it
doesn't matter.

01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:23.545
Investors are that way too,
they'll sometimes put part of

01:01:23.545 --> 01:01:27.292
their portfolio in "I can play
with this" mental compartment

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:30.150
and others in another mental
compartment.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:37.515
Anyway, I just want to come
back--I have maybe a little bit

01:01:37.515 --> 01:01:42.344
more to say about this,
but let me come back and talk

01:01:42.344 --> 01:01:45.539
just about the problem set we
talked about last period.

01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:50.431
Problem Set #3--you've got your
second problem set here--Problem

01:01:50.431 --> 01:01:54.469
Set #3 is a stock market
forecasting exercise and the

01:01:54.469 --> 01:01:58.973
spreadsheet that I have up here
is one spreadsheet that you

01:01:58.973 --> 01:02:02.544
could use to do that.
It's illustrated--I clarified

01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:04.630
it a little bit in the version I
put up.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.949
So, you run a regression like
that to predict the stock

01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:11.438
market.
This is actually a hands-on

01:02:11.438 --> 01:02:14.844
experience that's supposed to
help you eliminate your

01:02:14.844 --> 01:02:18.119
overconfidence by trying to
predict the market.

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:25.408
This is the example where I
tried to use time as a predictor

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:32.820
of the stock market and failed
pretty decisively to do so.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.831
What I want to say is that I
have this spreadsheet up here

01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:42.578
that has some data--it has
monthly--this is my 130-year

01:02:42.578 --> 01:02:47.617
long stock price series,
but you could add other data

01:02:47.617 --> 01:02:53.047
and whatever--if you can find
data series somewhere it would

01:02:53.047 --> 01:02:57.650
be more fun to try to predict
using other data.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:00.739
This is just for you to really
try to do it.

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:04.535
Some people do sports things,
so if somebody wins the Super

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:08.396
Bowl--I don't know what the
story is--this is a famous story

01:03:08.396 --> 01:03:12.650
actually--the stock market goes
up or goes--do you know that.

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:15.922
I don't know this exact
repeated story--so you could

01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:19.452
create other variables like a
dummy variable for winning

01:03:19.452 --> 01:03:23.110
the--somebody winning the Super
Bowl and put that in.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:27.068
There's a famous story--it goes
back to the 1930s--about skirt

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:30.139
lengths and the stock market.
Do you know this story?

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.603
In the 1920s,
an unprecedented thing happened

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:37.382
in women's fashion,
never been seen before in the

01:03:37.382 --> 01:03:41.233
United States,
maybe in--women started wearing

01:03:41.233 --> 01:03:44.059
short skirts and it was
scandalous.

01:03:44.059 --> 01:03:47.119
They weren't quite mini skirts,
but they were scandalous.

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:51.813
The women's hemlines rose and
peaked in 1929 and then the

01:03:51.813 --> 01:03:57.010
skirt lengths came down in the
1930s, right with the market;

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:00.316
so that was noticed.
Some people thought there was

01:04:00.316 --> 01:04:04.487
some euphoria that was driving
women crazy or something about

01:04:04.487 --> 01:04:07.130
the 1920s--the optimism,
the sense;

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:10.440
it sort of happened again in
the '70s.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.842
Remember, the mini skirts came
in the 1970s,

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:14.822
right?
Then the 1970s--'74 crash

01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:18.010
didn't exactly--I don't know if
hemlines came down.

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.977
But anyway, I had one student
who thought, well maybe there

01:04:21.977 --> 01:04:26.082
are other fashion things that
explain the market and she went

01:04:26.082 --> 01:04:30.460
back to microfilm newspapers and
measured the width of men's ties

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.464
in fashion advertisements.
She thought,

01:04:33.464 --> 01:04:37.401
wide ties are a sign of--it's
like a short skirt I guess--a

01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:41.677
sign of optimism and excitement,
so she collected data on widths

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:44.391
of ties.
She had a time series--this is

01:04:44.391 --> 01:04:47.626
a very good answer to a very
good problem set--and she

01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:51.227
collected fifty years of data on
the width of men's ties and

01:04:51.227 --> 01:04:54.340
correlated--to see if it
predicted the market.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.889
Unfortunately it did not,
but it was a wonderful choice.

01:04:58.889 --> 01:05:02.417
I'm hoping that some of you can
think of interesting things to

01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:04.730
do to try to predict the stock
market.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:09.000
Alright, I'll see you again in
two days.

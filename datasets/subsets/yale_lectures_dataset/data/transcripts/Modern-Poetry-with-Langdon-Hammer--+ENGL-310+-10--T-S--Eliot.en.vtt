00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.097
In talking about Pound and
The Cantos last week,

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:18.970
I was talking about translation
a lot.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.686
In the case of Eliot I'll be
talking about quotation,

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:30.732
a related but different
practice, and one that we'll see

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:33.810
again in Marianne Moore.
 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:42.571
In Pound's case there is a wish
in poetry for immediacy,

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:49.900
for some kind of seemingly
natural language.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.480
Pound doesn't want,
and doesn't use,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.367
quotation marks,
just as he doesn't use

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:02.497
footnotes.
If you look at Pound in any of

00:01:02.497 --> 00:01:08.290
the editions of his work,
from The Cantos

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.000
backward,
you will find that the poems

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.210
are presented without notes,
without any kind of apparatus,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.830
without any kind of help.
 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.286
That's because,
I think, Pound wants to,

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:36.185
in some sense,
give you a--he doesn't want to

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.110
get in your way in any sense.
 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.532
He wants you to have a kind of
immediate experience of the

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:48.110
writing that he's presenting,
even when it comes in the form

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.735
of quotation.
But as I suggested,

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:58.045
for Pound, a sort of central
practice is translation,

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:04.719
which he also describes as
transmitting the impulse.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:13.142
And I spoke last time as if the
impulse meant the motive or the

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:17.490
emotion in a piece of writing.
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.706
I think that Pound also had a
kind of scientific or technical

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:25.360
sense of that process of
transmitting the impulse,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.389
and that what he wants to do is
carry;

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.720
he wants writing to carry
energy.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.704
He wants it to carry a kind of
pulse, and he wants to give you

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:43.039
a kind of direct access to this.
 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:48.240
The contrast with Eliot is
striking, I think.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.076
Instead of translation,
you find in Eliot more often

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:57.762
quotation;
quotation which implies a

00:02:57.762 --> 00:03:03.590
certain relation to the literary
past, just as Pound's practices

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.030
of translation imply a relation
to tradition.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.250
Think about the difference
between these forms,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.819
translation and quotation.
 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.806
It's a way to understand the
differences between Eliot and

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:25.055
Pound, and through them to think
about at least two of modern

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:30.479
poetry's possible relations to
the literature of the past.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.610
Remember, too,
that modern poetry – and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.701
that's a word or a phrase that
Eliot and Pound both used –

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:45.451
that modern poetry is a
specifically historical

00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:49.631
category.
It's a historical way of naming

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:55.661
what it is.
You could contrast this with

00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:01.389
Romantic poetry,
say, or Imagism,

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:12.307
which are names or labels that
identify something more like an

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:18.930
aesthetic project or a tendency.
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.207
Here, to call modern poetry
"modern" is to choose as its

00:04:26.207 --> 00:04:34.412
defining quality its position in
history, its place in literary

00:04:34.412 --> 00:04:40.633
history.
And it does place modern poetry

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:44.220
in history ambiguously.
 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.554
Is modern poetry--is its
modernness an index of the way

00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:57.530
it extends the past,
or is it rather "modern"

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.420
because it breaks with the past?
 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.744
Does "modern" mean some kind of
renewal and continuity,

00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:11.790
or does it mean rupture?
 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.665
Translation and quotation
suggest, as I say,

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:20.519
different relations to the
past.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:25.509
Pound aims to "make it new"
itself, I suggested,

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.500
a translated phrase from the
ancient Chinese.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.803
Pound, in doing this,
aims to carry culture forward,

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:42.459
to hand it over to us as a kind
of living and immediate thing.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:48.750
The past is renewable in
translation, it is communicable.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.329
That's part of the premise of
translation.

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:56.133
For Pound, the past is
something that can be

00:05:56.133 --> 00:06:00.556
re-embodied continually and
needs to be re-embodied

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:04.980
continually, over and over again
in new forms.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.730
In this sense,
translation envisions a past

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.819
that is metamorphic and mobile
and durable.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.300
It's something that is always
essentially itself.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.230
It's something that is capable
of being carried forward.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.842
And you think about Pound's
voyagers, his seafarers –

00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:34.350
Odysseus or the "Seafarer" poet
– as being agents or

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.819
representatives of acts of
translation.

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:45.673
They embody the action of
carrying something across,

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.992
journeying.
In quotation,

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:54.558
however, the past is something
to be preserved,

00:06:54.558 --> 00:07:01.104
which is different;
preserved or maybe mocked,

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:10.069
in the sense of--mocked in the
sense of copied or parodied.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:15.539
Quotation seems to imply two
possible relations to the past,

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.802
when you think about it:
deference to the past,

00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:23.140
deference to what has been
said;

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.769
or some kind of violation of it.
 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:31.730
When you quote someone,
especially maybe your parents

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.069
or a teacher,
what are you doing?

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:43.596
Probably you mean either to
honor them or to mock them,

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:47.020
right?
To, in a sense,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.213
defer to their authority or to
take it away,

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:58.779
to empty it out.
Both of these are possible:

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:04.438
empty it out by parroting it,
treating it as if it were

00:08:04.438 --> 00:08:11.250
merely iterable and formulaic
and therefore without substance.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.909
Eliot's quotations teeter
ambiguously between these two

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:20.913
options and sometimes you may
feel he's doing the one thing

00:08:20.913 --> 00:08:25.399
and sometimes you may feel he's
doing the other;

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:30.077
that he's somehow deferring to
the past and honoring it,

00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:35.350
or he's doing something quite
subversive, something parodic.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.687
And in Pound I don't think
there's any of that ambiguity,

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:42.929
ever.
It's a very striking contrast.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:51.932
If you listen to Pound online,
you hear a voice that is fierce

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:56.950
and melodramatic and in earnest.
 

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.848
You listen to Eliot,
you hear another voice

00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:04.448
entirely;
one dry, diffident,

00:09:04.448 --> 00:09:07.570
hard to place tonally.
 

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:13.824
This is all worked into the
poetry and our encounters with

00:09:13.824 --> 00:09:19.526
it on the page.
Again, you might contrast the

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:27.730
heroic figures that you meet in
Pound, whether they're Odysseus

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:35.933
or a troubadour poet or one of
the political leaders that Pound

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:40.576
fastens on.
These are men of will and

00:09:40.576 --> 00:09:42.799
willpower and action.
 

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:46.889
These are the people that
attract Pound's admiration and

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:51.279
imagination.
Whom do you meet in Eliot?

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.814
J.
Alfred Prufrock,

00:09:53.814 --> 00:10:02.262
this figure of extraordinary
indecisiveness and indeterminate

00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:07.049
will, someone who's diffident.
 

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:13.543
Well, Prufrock is surely a
version of Eliot and we

00:10:13.543 --> 00:10:20.566
encounter in Eliot generally
some of the problems that

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:28.384
Prufrock raises for us through
his meandering mode of speech

00:10:28.384 --> 00:10:32.889
and difficult-to-place tone.
 

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:38.667
Let's look at some pictures of
Eliot, maybe my favorite one,

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:44.543
especially since we're going to
be thinking about and talking

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:49.440
about Eliot's age and how he
projects himself.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.070
This is Tom at eight.
 

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.296
He was born in St.
 

00:10:55.296 --> 00:11:00.863
Louis, the only major British
poet born in St.

00:11:00.863 --> 00:11:05.169
Louis, in 1888.
He went to Harvard.

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:14.841
This was not a surprise and,
in a sense, it was a family

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.404
mission.
He spent his summers,

00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:21.755
importantly,
in Massachusetts and on the

00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:26.309
coast of Massachusetts,
the North Shore of Boston.

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:31.860
And these places return and
recur in his poetry.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:40.843
As a graduate student at
Harvard in 1910 he expatriated

00:11:40.843 --> 00:11:42.840
to Europe.
 

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.330
 
 

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.809
This is Eliot in 1910,1911.
 

00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:59.627
He had studied philosophy at
Harvard and he went on to study

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:04.360
philosophy at Cambridge with
Bertrand Russell.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.077
He wrote his Master's thesis on
F.H.

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:11.198
Bradley.
That's an association I'll say

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:14.559
more about when we get to The
Waste Land.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:22.144
In 1915 he met and married
Vivienne Haigh-Wood,

00:12:22.144 --> 00:12:29.070
a charismatic and volatile
Englishwoman.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:35.587
This romance produced for Eliot
a kind of dramatic conflict with

00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:41.483
his family over his wish to
marry her, his wish to take up

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:45.796
residence in England;
and behind all this,

00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:49.248
and with all this,
his sense of vocation,

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:53.877
his desire to become,
to establish himself as a poet

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:56.691
and man of letters rather than
the

00:12:56.691 --> 00:13:01.295
more-easily-to-be-approved-of
career of a professor and

00:13:01.295 --> 00:13:05.899
scholar that he had seemed to
have been made for.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:13.708
Pound was Eliot's older friend
and mentor, very quickly upon

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:20.185
their meeting in Europe;
and Pound, always putting his

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:25.419
fingers in everything,
wrote quite an extraordinary

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:28.350
letter to Eliot's father.
 

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.698
And I've got that on your
handout, on the top page,

00:13:31.698 --> 00:13:33.640
a little quotation from it.
 

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.501
It says a lot about Pound;
it says something about Eliot,

00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.647
too.
This is a letter in which Pound

00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:44.716
felt the need to,
probably with some

00:13:44.716 --> 00:13:49.450
encouragement but probably also
some embarrassment,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:57.283
from Eliot, felt the need to
defend Eliot's expatriation to

00:13:57.283 --> 00:14:00.390
the family patriarch.
 

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.841
And Pound says:
As to his [Eliot's]

00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:07.898
coming to London,
well anything else is a waste

00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:09.360
of time and energy.
 

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.100
No one in London cares a hang
what is written in America.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.460
After getting an American
audience a man has to begin all

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.700
over again if he plans for an
international hearing.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.447
[And who wouldn't plan for an
international hearing?]

00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:25.970
He even begins at a
disadvantage.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.029
London likes discovering her
own gods.

00:14:29.029 --> 00:14:33.651
Again, in a literary career,
mediocrity is worse than

00:14:33.651 --> 00:14:37.590
useless.
Either a man goes in to go the

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:43.284
whole hog or he had better take
to selling soap and gents

00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:47.297
furnishings.
[Is this the right way to write

00:14:47.297 --> 00:14:48.180
Mr.
Eliot?

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.650
I don't know.
He must have felt so.]

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.686
The situation has been very
well summed up in the sentence,

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:59.070
"Henry James stayed in Paris
and read Turgenev and Flaubert.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.531
Mr.
Howles returned to America and

00:15:02.531 --> 00:15:04.629
read Henry James."
 

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:08.597
[And then he says in another
important sentence:]

00:15:08.597 --> 00:15:13.392
A literary man's income depends
very much on how rigidly he

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:18.600
insists on doing exactly what he
himself wants to do.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.562
Interesting.
The idea is that by

00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:29.767
establishing some kind of
independence from tastes in a

00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:34.415
literary market,
Eliot will in fact come to

00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:38.778
establish his position in that
literary market,

00:15:38.778 --> 00:15:42.940
and his ability,
in fact, to create taste.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.250
And so in fact he did.
 

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.218
At this early point in Eliot's
career there is a kind of

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:57.426
important conflict between
conformity and revolt:

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:01.550
conformity to his parents'
wishes,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.620
social expectations;
or revolt from them,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.989
which is also,
I think, another way to

00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:13.634
describe the tension between two
different senses or aspects of

00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:17.673
quotation.
Pound wants Eliot's father to

00:16:17.673 --> 00:16:21.544
see that his son's revolt is
okay, because,

00:16:21.544 --> 00:16:25.139
in fact, he's also going to
conform.

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:28.817
He's going to conform to a
certain ideal of tradition,

00:16:28.817 --> 00:16:30.759
to professional standards.
 

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:38.828
He's not just going to have a
wild time, he's going to work

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:44.950
hard and do what a literary man
should do.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.572
Eliot, you'll see,
takes up these themes in

00:16:48.572 --> 00:16:54.093
different terms but related ways
in "Tradition and the Individual

00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:57.629
Talent," which I'll talk about
later.

00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:01.428
Like Pound, Eliot,
we'll see, wants to ally

00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:05.860
himself with tradition,
wants to ally himself with

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.930
tradition over against vers
libre,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:16.434
Amy Lowell and "Amygism," and
at the same time his relation to

00:17:16.434 --> 00:17:20.380
tradition, even from very early
on,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:27.936
was potentially subversive,
and his poetry was very new and

00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:32.531
disturbing.
Now, there are all sorts of

00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:38.549
interesting things in the
Beinecke, including – here he

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:44.138
is again, the author of
"Prufrock" – including T.S.

00:17:44.138 --> 00:17:48.768
Eliot's waistcoat;
H.D.'s death mask I showed you

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:52.789
last time;
here's Eliot's waistcoat.

00:17:52.789 --> 00:18:00.663
I like this as an object,
as part of the literary archive

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:07.570
we have.
Also, it's interesting isn't it?

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.220
It's a piece of Eliot's costume.
 

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.749
Costume was very important for
T.S.

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:18.024
Eliot.
I think it's also potentially a

00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:22.579
kind of emblem of quotation in
his work.

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:30.509
Is Eliot taking on the past and
the aura of propriety in order

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:34.930
to parody it or empower himself?
 

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.599
These are questions we might
ask even about the waistcoat.

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:49.158
Is it some kind of disguise,
is it a costume through which

00:18:49.158 --> 00:18:55.764
he conforms to social forms and
expectations,

00:18:55.764 --> 00:19:01.769
or is it again something he
puts on?

00:19:01.769 --> 00:19:06.910
All of these questions are at,
for me, the center of Eliot's

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:11.268
interest and power,
and also, I think,

00:19:11.268 --> 00:19:19.414
some of the lasting power that
he exerts in schools and for

00:19:19.414 --> 00:19:23.186
students.
I will confess that my high

00:19:23.186 --> 00:19:26.586
school yearbook carries a
quotation from T.S.

00:19:26.586 --> 00:19:29.677
Eliot, in fact,
from "The Love Song of J.

00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:33.849
Alfred Prufrock," which I won't
identify for you.

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:39.352
And as I think about that,
why I cared about Eliot when I

00:19:39.352 --> 00:19:43.970
was seventeen or so – not that
I don't now,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:51.457
too – when I think about
that, it seems to me that his

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:59.490
special combination of ambition
and aggression expressed,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.815
as it is very often by young
people through parody or satire

00:20:04.815 --> 00:20:08.564
or diffidence,
was powerful for me,

00:20:08.564 --> 00:20:11.329
too, as a young person.
 

00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:17.612
All of this is on display in
Eliot's great poem,

00:20:17.612 --> 00:20:20.286
"The Love Song of J.
 

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:28.440
Alfred Prufrock," which is what
I'll concentrate on today.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:37.013
"Prufrock" is a poem composed
initially at Harvard and

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:46.720
something Eliot carried along
with him in the years after;

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.282
a poem created out of pages and
pages of drafts,

00:20:51.282 --> 00:20:57.301
which Eliot kept adding to and
going back over and re-combining

00:20:57.301 --> 00:21:02.111
and re-composing,
somewhat like his repetitive

00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:04.190
and wayward speaker.
 

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:10.888
You can find early versions of
the poem in a book of Eliot's

00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:17.472
early and otherwise uncollected
work that Christopher Ricks

00:21:17.472 --> 00:21:23.717
edited a few years ago called
Inventions of the March

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:27.824
Hare.
It's a very interesting book,

00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:32.715
and you can see Eliot exploring
different ways to write this

00:21:32.715 --> 00:21:36.279
poem, which hung around for a
long time.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:42.660
It was eventually published in
1915 in Poetry magazine.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.377
And in this way,
just like "Mowing," just like

00:21:46.377 --> 00:21:51.170
Yeats's "The Fisherman," which
also appeared there then;

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.991
also, a poem we'll get to in a
couple of weeks,

00:21:54.991 --> 00:21:59.538
Marianne Moore's "A Grave";
and some of the Imagist poems

00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:02.857
we discussed last week – all
these appeared,

00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:06.250
thanks to Pound,
in Poetry magazine.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.640
The poem became the title of
Eliot's first volume.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:17.844
Interestingly – this is the
cover of the book – it leaves

00:22:17.844 --> 00:22:23.728
off the full title which was
Prufrock and Other

00:22:23.728 --> 00:22:30.789
Observations,
which is an interesting title.

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:34.339
First of all,
is "Prufrock" an observation?

00:22:34.339 --> 00:22:38.641
Eliot was treating this
character as if he were an

00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:41.423
observation.
You can think about what that

00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:43.880
might imply.
And then think about that word

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.569
"observations."
It suggests something seen,

00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:49.680
of course, as well as some kind
of speculation.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:56.680
It's also a way of defining and
presenting Eliot's poems.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.318
He doesn't say Prufrock and
Other Poems,

00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:02.130
he says Prufrock and Other
Observations.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.887
And Observations is,
in fact, a word that Marianne

00:23:06.887 --> 00:23:11.900
Moore would use to title her
first book of poems a few years

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.972
later.
On that cover we see Eliot's

00:23:15.972 --> 00:23:21.727
name and Prufrock's,
in some kind of alteration –

00:23:21.727 --> 00:23:28.748
alternation, rather--"Prufrock"
being a little bit bigger than

00:23:28.748 --> 00:23:32.316
"T.S.
Eliot," but raising for us

00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:38.762
graphically the simple question:
what is the relationship

00:23:38.762 --> 00:23:41.869
between these two?
 

00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:49.610
Yes, the one man created the
other thing, "Prufrock."

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.860
Are they the same thing?
 

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.950
How different are they?
 

00:23:53.950 --> 00:24:00.990
Here's the interior of the book.
 

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.734
You can see--although,
well, you can't see,

00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:07.655
but if you get a better look at
this online you will see that

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:11.750
this book,
which is in the Beinecke,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.931
has a signature on it,
"W.

00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:19.130
Stevens, NY,
October 17,1917."

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:24.320
So, this was Stevens's copy,
which he, as a young man

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:30.609
wandering around the streets of
New York, picked up and kept.

00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:39.169
It was, like Frost's early
work, published in London in

00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:46.619
1917, now in Bloomsbury,
by the Egoist Press.

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:51.989
And there's the table of
contents, the first and long

00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:57.461
poem included in the volume
being "The Love Song of J.

00:24:57.461 --> 00:24:59.630
Alfred Prufrock."
 

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:05.577
Well, what do we expect from a
poem that calls itself that,

00:25:05.577 --> 00:25:07.628
"The Love Song of J.
 

00:25:07.628 --> 00:25:09.680
Alfred Prufrock"?
 

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.222
First of all,
what do we expect from this

00:25:12.222 --> 00:25:14.510
genre, the love song,
a love song?

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.790
What is a love song?
 

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.150
What is a love song like?
 

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.131
Presumably, it would be a
romantic poem,

00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:24.990
even a poem about romance.
 

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:32.388
What we get is perhaps
something more like a parody of

00:25:32.388 --> 00:25:38.809
a romantic poem and something
much stranger.

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:43.450
This is going to be familiar to
very many of you:

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.326
Let us go then, you and I
When the evening is spread out

00:25:48.326 --> 00:25:52.727
against the sky
Like a patient etherised upon a

00:25:52.727 --> 00:25:55.741
table;
Let us go, through certain

00:25:55.741 --> 00:25:59.730
half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.599
Of restless nights in one-night
cheap hotels

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:06.250
And sawdust restaurants with
oyster-shells:

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.280
Streets that follow like a
tedious argument

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.058
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming

00:26:14.058 --> 00:26:18.750
question…
Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.619
Let us go and make our visit.
 

00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:25.810
In the room the women come and
go

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.590
Talking of Michelangelo.
 

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.250
 
 

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.783
Meter?
It's a topic we've raised

00:26:37.783 --> 00:26:43.849
before.
It isn't iambic pentameter.

00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:46.911
It's notably,
importantly,

00:26:46.911 --> 00:26:49.849
not iambic pentameter.
 

00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:54.927
Instead, you are introduced to
another kind of rhythm of

00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:58.619
speech, which you can work at to
scan,

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:02.254
but without even going into any
detail about it,

00:27:02.254 --> 00:27:06.119
I think, we can describe that
rhythm as languid,

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:16.647
as open to variation,
as including hesitancy and

00:27:16.647 --> 00:27:21.799
sometimes abruptness.
 

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:28.250
It is a way of speaking that is
interrupted, often;

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:38.369
is alternately voluble and
nervous.

00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:46.237
The poem's initial
discontinuities of rhythm and

00:27:46.237 --> 00:27:55.108
pattern and image introduce us
to really a new kind of

00:27:55.108 --> 00:28:03.980
structure in poetry that would
include a kind of,

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:09.289
almost a principle that any
time you establish a pattern you

00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:11.450
must quickly break it.
 

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.698
"Let us go then,
you and I, / when the evening

00:28:14.698 --> 00:28:20.379
is spread out against the sky";
it sounds like this character's

00:28:20.379 --> 00:28:23.359
going to speak in couplets.
 

00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:27.340
"Like a patient etherised upon
a table";

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.829
where did that come from?
 

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:37.109
We could supply another third
line that would be very

00:28:37.109 --> 00:28:40.049
different, I think.
 

00:28:40.049 --> 00:28:44.888
Immediately,
we are invited to

00:28:44.888 --> 00:28:55.400
surrealistically conjure a prone
patient, someone sick and being

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:02.545
attended to and "etherised,"
unconscious,

00:29:02.545 --> 00:29:07.059
and objectified upon a table.
 

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:12.838
If we felt as though we were
going to be in a romantic,

00:29:12.838 --> 00:29:18.616
crepuscular atmosphere,
we are suddenly confronted with

00:29:18.616 --> 00:29:22.790
an image quite disturbing and
ugly.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.039
And note that it doesn't rhyme.
 

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:32.143
I suppose you could connect
"table" to "hotels" and

00:29:32.143 --> 00:29:36.659
"shelves" below,
but it's not a strong

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:44.349
connection and there has been no
preparation for it before.

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:48.123
So, immediately,
we are given an image and a

00:29:48.123 --> 00:29:50.493
rhyme decision,
if you like,

00:29:50.493 --> 00:29:55.583
that complicates any kind of
sense of pattern that we might

00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:59.619
have predicted from the first
two lines.

00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:06.034
That rhythm,
well, the contrast to an iambic

00:30:06.034 --> 00:30:12.299
poem is strong and should be
emphasized.

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:17.020
And I want to draw your
attention to an example that

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.462
would have been in the ears of
Eliot's listeners,

00:30:21.462 --> 00:30:24.980
and that is – Eliot's
listeners;

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:31.206
Eliot's readers – that is the
end of Tennyson's "Ulysses," a

00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:35.800
poem well known in the
nineteenth century:

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.660
The long day wanes;
the slow moon climbs;

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.210
the deep
Moans round with many voices.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.660
[I quote it,
too, because Eliot loved this

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.851
passage and it returns in his
late poetry in interesting

00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:51.550
echoes.]
Come my

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.336
friends.
'Tis not too late to seek a

00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:55.700
newer world.
…

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.609
It may be that the gulfs will
wash us down;

00:30:57.609 --> 00:31:00.309
It may be we shall touch the
Happy Isles,

00:31:00.309 --> 00:31:03.170
And see the great Achilles,
whom we knew.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.970
Tho' much is taken, much abides;
and tho'

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.089
We are not now that strength
which in old days

00:31:09.089 --> 00:31:12.111
Moved earth and heaven,
[we're older]

00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:14.630
that which we are,
we are,--

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.690
One equal temper of heroic
hearts,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.190
Made weak by time and fate,
but strong in will

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.098
To strive, to seek,
to find, and not to

00:31:24.098 --> 00:31:27.247
yield.
Echoing, I think,

00:31:27.247 --> 00:31:32.015
Milton's Satan,
the blank verse suddenly

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:37.759
becomes a kind of heroic medium
of the will.

00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:42.973
Well, the contrast is important
with the poetry that Eliot is

00:31:42.973 --> 00:31:48.012
presenting to us because here
the question of the speaker's

00:31:48.012 --> 00:31:53.573
will is so much at issue and his
manner of speech is so different

00:31:53.573 --> 00:31:57.569
from the example that Tennyson
gives us.

00:31:57.569 --> 00:32:02.080
Tennyson specifically,
in this dramatic monologue,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.774
as in others of his
oeurve or other important

00:32:06.774 --> 00:32:12.777
nineteenth-century examples,
introduces us to a dramatic

00:32:12.777 --> 00:32:18.778
speaker who has a kind of
coherent character and whose

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:22.497
unity of character,
if you like,

00:32:22.497 --> 00:32:27.509
is allied to the unity of the
verse form itself.

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:31.299
Eliot gives us something very
different.

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:37.559
He creates, in "Prufrock," I
would say, not a character.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:42.480
Rather, he creates something
more like a consciousness.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:51.797
He creates a fragmentary
consciousness that rises and

00:32:51.797 --> 00:32:59.859
falls, takes shape and disperses
before us.

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:06.354
John Stuart Mill said in a
memorable passage that poetry

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:13.321
– lyric poetry is what he was
thinking of – is overheard

00:33:13.321 --> 00:33:18.099
speech.
Overheard speech.

00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:23.437
And you can think,
if you have some sense of the

00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:30.251
Romantic poetry of Wordsworth or
Coleridge as examples before

00:33:30.251 --> 00:33:34.061
you,
of what Mill had in mind,

00:33:34.061 --> 00:33:41.024
the way in which in those poems
we listen in on a soliquizing

00:33:41.024 --> 00:33:46.889
poet's thoughts.
Listening to "Prufrock" is much

00:33:46.889 --> 00:33:53.854
less like listening to someone
speak on the street or on the

00:33:53.854 --> 00:34:00.819
stage than it is like closing
your eyes and remembering,

00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:05.980
or inventing voices in your
mind.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.929
Eliot is creating a kind of
overheard inner speech.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:22.244
He's letting us listen in on a
mind that we don't see whole,

00:34:22.244 --> 00:34:26.090
we don't feel whole.
 

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.900
We only get parts of it.
 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:37.084
Fluctuation:
this is the medium and the

00:34:37.084 --> 00:34:44.570
rhythm that we enter when we
enter the poem.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:50.768
There is, as I was already
suggesting, no overarching

00:34:50.768 --> 00:34:55.059
pattern for the poem's verse
form.

00:34:55.059 --> 00:35:00.592
I think this is probably true
for other dimensions of

00:35:00.592 --> 00:35:03.039
organization as well.
 

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:06.732
There are rather,
in this poem,

00:35:06.732 --> 00:35:14.117
what I would call a kind of set
of unfolding local systems of

00:35:14.117 --> 00:35:18.960
organization.
There are couplets.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.647
We see couplets in that first
paragraph, but then they're not

00:35:23.647 --> 00:35:25.599
systematically pursued.
 

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:32.310
Instead, what you get in the
poem are a lot of loose ends,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.233
pauses;
bits and pieces of language,

00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:41.449
language that is almost always
full of quotations.

00:35:41.449 --> 00:35:47.030
Your editor will give you the
source for some of them.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:52.681
What we have then in the poem
as you move through it is a lot

00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:55.789
of shifting, improvised orders.
 

00:35:55.789 --> 00:36:01.282
This formal instability in the
poem is related to,

00:36:01.282 --> 00:36:06.550
and it constructs,
a special sort of speaker,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:12.235
one who is performing for us
his thoughts,

00:36:12.235 --> 00:36:20.001
his thoughts experienced as a
set of routines or riffs or

00:36:20.001 --> 00:36:24.022
acts,
and they come and go without

00:36:24.022 --> 00:36:27.290
very definite aim or conclusion.
 

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:31.309
 
 

00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:34.730
Looking at the cover of
Prufrock,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.903
I asked you to think about the
relationship between Prufrock

00:36:39.903 --> 00:36:41.570
and T.S.
Eliot.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:47.839
You can think about "Prufrock,"
the name itself:

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:52.374
"J.
Alfred Prufrock," almost a kind

00:36:52.374 --> 00:36:54.642
of parody of T.S.
 

00:36:54.642 --> 00:36:59.150
Eliot.
The name suggests a kind of

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.880
upper-class English or
Anglophile person.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:10.340
Those formal initials are
pretentious in a way.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:16.625
I think it's proper to think of
Prufrock as in some sense a kind

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:20.815
of comic figure,
almost like a cartoon or a

00:37:20.815 --> 00:37:23.309
caricature or device.
 

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:32.540
On one level he is a kind of
parody of a Romantic singer.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.579
He is bourgeois;
he is intellectualizing;

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:42.141
he's incapable of grasping and
expressing what we expect from a

00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:45.460
love song, that is,
strong emotion.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.324
The poem can be seen,
too, as a kind of critique of

00:37:51.324 --> 00:37:57.070
Romantic egotism and of the
Wordsworthian ideal of

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:02.094
expression.
This is something that Eliot

00:38:02.094 --> 00:38:08.274
theorizes polemically in his
essay, "Tradition and the

00:38:08.274 --> 00:38:10.840
Individual Talent."
 

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.208
And in fact,
why don't we look there for a

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:20.429
few minutes to get more sense of
Eliot's ideas.

00:38:20.429 --> 00:38:26.633
On page 946,
the back of your book there,

00:38:26.633 --> 00:38:35.473
he says, quoting Wordsworth in
the "Preface" to Lyrical

00:38:35.473 --> 00:38:40.325
Ballads:
…We must believe that

00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:44.069
"emotion recollected in
tranquility" is an inexact

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:47.069
formula,
for it is neither emotion,

00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:50.556
nor recollection,
nor without distortion of

00:38:50.556 --> 00:38:52.550
meaning, tranquility.
 

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.576
[That you get in an Eliot poem,
at least.]

00:38:55.576 --> 00:38:59.415
It is a concentration,
and a new thing resulting from

00:38:59.415 --> 00:39:02.348
the concentration,
of a very great number of

00:39:02.348 --> 00:39:05.018
experiences which to the
practical and active person

00:39:05.018 --> 00:39:07.269
would not seem to be experiences
at all;

00:39:07.269 --> 00:39:11.138
it is a concentration which
does not happen consciously or

00:39:11.138 --> 00:39:14.443
of deliberation.
These experiences are not

00:39:14.443 --> 00:39:19.611
"recollected," and they finally
unite in an atmosphere which is

00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:24.362
"tranquil" only in that it is a
passive attending upon the

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:28.017
event.
Eliot is trying to describe

00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:32.327
poetry here as having a kind
of--generating a kind of

00:39:32.327 --> 00:39:37.299
experience in and of itself that
is distinct from any kind of

00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:42.895
recollected experience,
and it is curiously impersonal

00:39:42.895 --> 00:39:44.970
as he imagines it.
 

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.794
And he continues:
There is a great deal,

00:39:47.794 --> 00:39:50.012
in the writing of poetry,
which must be conscious and

00:39:50.012 --> 00:39:52.266
deliberate.
In fact, the bad poet is

00:39:52.266 --> 00:39:55.718
usually unconscious where he
ought to be conscious,

00:39:55.718 --> 00:39:59.170
and conscious where he ought to
be unconscious.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.577
[We know what he means.]
Both errors tend to make him

00:40:03.577 --> 00:40:05.834
"personal."
[And now T.S.

00:40:05.834 --> 00:40:09.830
Eliot will say:]
Poetry is not a turning loose

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.559
of emotion, but an escape from
emotion;

00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:18.240
it is not the expression of
personality, but an escape from

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.467
personality.
But, of course,

00:40:20.467 --> 00:40:25.006
only those who have personality
and emotions know what it means

00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:28.300
to want to escape from these
things.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:34.625
Which is an extraordinary kind
of coda to this polemical

00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:39.697
passage, and revealing,
of course, the way in which

00:40:39.697 --> 00:40:44.744
Eliot, even as he's polemicizing
against a romantic poetry that

00:40:44.744 --> 00:40:49.421
would be too personal,
is deeply invested in the

00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:54.809
personal and personality,
and conflicted about it.

00:40:54.809 --> 00:41:03.539
I've been talking about
ambiguity in Eliot.

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:06.769
Well, we can speak of
"ambivalence."

00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:11.153
This essay retains,
even while it is critiquing,

00:41:11.153 --> 00:41:14.789
a certain romantic story of
creation.

00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:19.719
And we could say something
similar about Eliot's love song.

00:41:19.719 --> 00:41:25.768
"Prufrock" is a kind of
pre-text or a device through

00:41:25.768 --> 00:41:29.920
which Eliot can speak of
himself.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.794
"Prufrock" becomes a way of
writing about the self when to

00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:41.051
Eliot it no longer seems
plausible to write as one's

00:41:41.051 --> 00:41:45.380
self, as Wordsworth had felt it
to be.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.348
You can think of "Prufrock" as
a kind of mask behind which you

00:41:50.348 --> 00:41:54.828
hear a young poet asking
questions about himself and his

00:41:54.828 --> 00:41:58.980
art.
List the poem's questions.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.110
Prufrock asks questions
throughout.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.640
Do you recall them?
 

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.190
They are: "Do I dare?"
 

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.500
"Do I dare disturb the
universe?"

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.580
"So how should I presume?"
 

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.480
And, "How should I begin?"
 

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.126
"Shall I say?"
He says that pretty often:

00:42:21.126 --> 00:42:22.786
"Shall I say this?
 

00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:24.630
Shall I say that?"
 

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:29.304
Daring, presuming,
beginning, "what shall I

00:42:29.304 --> 00:42:32.643
say?"--these are,
are they not,

00:42:32.643 --> 00:42:38.543
an ambitious young poet's
questions about how to write

00:42:38.543 --> 00:42:41.820
poetry.
The question is,

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:47.881
why should beginning be
something that you really have

00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:52.620
to dare?
What does that imply?

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.700
Why should it be frightening?
 

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.070
Why should it give you pause?
 

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:05.273
Why, if these are a young man's
questions, as I'm suggesting,

00:43:05.273 --> 00:43:09.719
does Prufrock seem as old,
as old and weary,

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:12.961
as he does?
In fact, how old do you think

00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:13.370
he is?
 

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:19.140
 
 

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.110
I don't know.
Ask yourselves that question;

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.610
ask yourselves what evidence
you would have for one answer or

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.630
another.
It's hard to pinpoint his age.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:35.996
Prufrock is,
isn't he, a kind of old-young

00:43:35.996 --> 00:43:39.400
man, or a young-old man?
 

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:46.515
He is cautious and aggressive
at the same time:

00:43:46.515 --> 00:43:50.093
old and young.
These paradoxes,

00:43:50.093 --> 00:43:53.127
I think, point to Eliot's sense
of his place,

00:43:53.127 --> 00:43:55.746
his own place,
in literary history,

00:43:55.746 --> 00:43:59.940
and some sense of what it meant
to be "modern" for Eliot.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.679
Prufrock is burdened by the
question of how to begin.

00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:08.600
Indeed, he begins exactly by
deferring beginning;

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.010
by failing to come to the point;
by putting it off;

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.960
by delaying because by
implication, beginning is indeed

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.909
something threatening,
something that must be dared.

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:25.127
But this only makes sense if
Prufrock really does want to

00:44:25.127 --> 00:44:29.414
disturb the universe,
or at least the system of

00:44:29.414 --> 00:44:31.929
culture as he found it.
 

00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:37.073
It only makes sense if
beginning really does require

00:44:37.073 --> 00:44:39.090
disturbing things.
 

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:45.585
The implication is that the
universe is already complete

00:44:45.585 --> 00:44:49.009
without Prufrock,
without T.S.

00:44:49.009 --> 00:44:54.559
Eliot and anything that he
might do or say.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:58.376
You can extend this to Eliot's
idea of culture and,

00:44:58.376 --> 00:45:01.582
in particular,
to his sense of the literary

00:45:01.582 --> 00:45:04.204
past.
You see the idea in "Tradition

00:45:04.204 --> 00:45:06.010
and the Individual Talent."
 

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:11.875
On pages 942 to 943,
he speaks of – towards the

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:18.839
bottom of the page on 942 –
tradition as a kind of ideal

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:21.650
order of monuments.
 

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:26.780
Tradition is in some sense,
well, it's monumental and it's

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.199
already complete,
as he imagines it.

00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:34.145
To add to it,
to enter it would be to change

00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:35.980
it, to disturb it.
 

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:43.559
In fact, Eliot evolves here a
quite ingenious and complicated

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:50.508
argument for how the new could
indeed be introduced to a

00:45:50.508 --> 00:45:57.329
tradition conceived in the terms
I just described.

00:45:57.329 --> 00:46:06.000
Eliot says, on the bottom of
the page, about any new poet:

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.991
The necessity that he
shall conform [and there's that

00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:13.268
word, "conform";
think of the waistcoat],

00:46:13.268 --> 00:46:17.174
that he shall cohere [and
remain put together],

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:22.440
is not one-sided [this was
quite an extraordinary argument;

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:28.420
he's saying it's not only
necessary for a new poet to

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:33.101
conform to tradition];
what happens when a new work of

00:46:33.101 --> 00:46:36.884
art is created is something that
happens simultaneously to all

00:46:36.884 --> 00:46:39.239
the works of art which preceded
it.

00:46:39.239 --> 00:46:42.030
[Something which happens
simultaneously to all the works

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.400
of art which preceded it.
 

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.617
This is quite a claim.]
The existing monuments form an

00:46:46.617 --> 00:46:50.058
ideal order among themselves,
which is modified by the

00:46:50.058 --> 00:46:53.760
introduction of the new (the
really new) work of art among

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.410
them.
The existing order is complete

00:46:56.410 --> 00:47:01.224
before the new work arrives;
for order to persist after the

00:47:01.224 --> 00:47:06.274
supervention of novelty [novelty
comes as something that

00:47:06.274 --> 00:47:08.723
supervenes;
it has force,

00:47:08.723 --> 00:47:14.181
it's a leopard in the temple],
the whole existing order

00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:17.849
must be, if ever so slightly,
altered;

00:47:17.849 --> 00:47:19.840
and so the relations,
proportions,

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.519
values of each work of art
toward the whole are readjusted,

00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:28.269
and this is conformity between
the old and the new.

00:47:28.269 --> 00:47:34.321
Here, Eliot is struggling with
an idea of tradition as

00:47:34.321 --> 00:47:41.400
something that is static and
fully present in and of itself,

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.184
a sense of the new as something
that is revolutionary and that

00:47:45.184 --> 00:47:48.800
threatens tradition,
or is threatened by it.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.630
How can he bring them into
alignment?

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:55.347
Well, through this very
complicated process that he

00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:58.650
describes which gives the
modern,

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:04.923
gives the new,
an extraordinary power to make

00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:12.052
us see and, in fact,
to realign the relations among

00:48:12.052 --> 00:48:16.329
all the works of the past.
 

00:48:16.329 --> 00:48:21.719
This is, as I say,
quite an extraordinary power.

00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:25.496
The implication is the new poet
must in some sense wrest

00:48:25.496 --> 00:48:29.547
authority from all those who
have come before through a kind

00:48:29.547 --> 00:48:32.500
of imaginative and rhetorical
violence,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:38.420
a kind of insurrection in the
temple of culture.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.983
Prufrock's sense of age
expresses for him a feeling of

00:48:42.983 --> 00:48:48.150
belatedness, an anxiety that
he's already run out of time.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.566
His very youth,
the fact that he's only just

00:48:51.566 --> 00:48:53.949
now starting,
makes him old.

00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:59.003
To presume would be to reverse
this order, to dare to come

00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:03.260
before and to claim priority for
his own work.

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:10.400
As I say these sentences,
I sound a whole lot like Harold

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:18.050
Bloom as he describes the
mission of any poet in his work,

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.359
The Anxiety of
Influence,

00:49:20.359 --> 00:49:24.084
and that is because Bloom's
work is deeply indebted

00:49:24.084 --> 00:49:28.107
precisely to Eliot and to
"Tradition and the Individual

00:49:28.107 --> 00:49:32.627
Talent."
These are questions I'll say a

00:49:32.627 --> 00:49:39.929
little bit more about next time,
as we finish discussing Eliot's

00:49:39.929 --> 00:49:47.000
"Love Song" and begin to talk
about The Waste Land.

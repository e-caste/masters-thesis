00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.850
Prof: Okay,
so let's begin.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.511
I asked you to bear two
questions in mind in reading the

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:17.070
Eichmann, and I'm going to get
to those in a minute.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.010
But before we get to that,
who was Adolf Eichmann?

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.150
 
 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:40.770
Who was Adolf Eichmann?
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.900
Student:  He was the
expert on Jewish immigration and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.810
relocation.
 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.000
Prof: But what was his
job?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.880
What was he there to do?
 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.190
Student:  Well,
in the beginning he was sent to

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.124
talk to the Jewish elder council
and try to negotiate the moving

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.621
of thousands of Jewish people as
quickly as possible from

00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:05.120
different areas throughout
Europe.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.250
Prof: Correct.
 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.709
What else was he supposed to do?
 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.010
Why don't you give somebody
else a chance?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.989
That was certainly part of what
he was doing.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:13.790
What else was he supposed to do?
 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.836
Was he somebody who was
involved in designing the final

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:27.099
solution, as it was called in
the Third Reich?

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:31.060
Was he a policy maker?
 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.090
People are shaking their heads.
 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.030
No he wasn't.
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.890
He was basically an
implementer, right?

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.949
He was obeying orders and his
job was to make the trains run

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:47.745
on time, literally speaking;
the trains that were going to

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:50.930
take Jews to concentration
camps.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.590
It was a complicated logistical
feat and he was in charge of it.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.299
His job was to make sure that
it was an efficiently run

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.569
operation.
 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.700
As I said, at the end of the
war he was actually captured by

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.060
the allied forces,
but they didn't realize what a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.158
significant figure he was.
 

00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:16.552
He was subsequently released,
inadvertently made his way to

00:02:16.552 --> 00:02:20.718
Latin America where he lived
undercover until the Mossad

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:25.966
found out where he was,
and in 1960 they kidnapped him,

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:32.117
brought him to Israel where he
was tried in the trial that you

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:35.848
read about in this book for
today.

00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:39.959
Found guilty of crimes against
the Jewish people and crimes

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.509
against humanity and put to
death.

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.560
 
 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.759
Okay, what kind of a person was
he?

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.318
What do you think motivated him?
 

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:58.516
When you read this what kind of
a person, what stood out about

00:02:58.516 --> 00:02:58.930
him?
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.615
Anybody? 
Student:  It seems

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:10.399
throughout the text that he was
driven by this idea of

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.288
self-advancement,
the need for...

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:15.090
Prof: He wanted to get
ahead.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.818
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:17.931
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 He wanted to impress his

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.430
superiors.
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.556
Student:  Yeah,
first and foremost,

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:21.229
I believe.
 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.519
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 He wanted to get an A,

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.500
right, pretty much?
 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.080
That's one thing that strikes
you about him,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.500
yeah.
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.050
What else struck you about him?
 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.165
Student:  The
thoughtlessness that he

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:34.229
demonstrated throughout the
campaign.

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.745
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 The what?

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:34.860
Sorry.
 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.669
Student:  The
thoughtlessness.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:36.139
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Thoughtlessness.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.247
Student:  Just kind of the
blind obedience to the Fuhrer's

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:38.490
word.
 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.640
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 He was not a reflective

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.900
man.
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.538
Student:  Not at all.
 

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:44.512
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 He's not somebody who

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:45.910
would question authority,
right?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.960
Did you get the impression he
hated Jews?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.819
Student:  No.
 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.879
Professor Ian Shapiro:  No.
 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.919
What makes you say that?
 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.009
Student:  I mean,
well first during his testimony

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.000
he claimed that he didn't hate
Jews.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.457
He actually was a supporter of
the Zionist movement through

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:04.449
some of the readings that he did
before 1939.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.838
And throughout even the years
between 1939 and 1945 when he

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:13.229
was carrying out all these
actions that were detrimental to

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:18.360
the Jewish people,
he found himself having Jewish

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.605
friends,
working with the Jewish people

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:23.579
trying to find solutions,
but as long as that didn't

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.610
contradict the orders of his
superiors.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.110
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 I think you've got him

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.600
exactly right.
 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.579
He was not somebody motivated
by a visceral anti-Semitism.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.406
Indeed, you get the impression
reading this book that if his

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:42.855
superiors had said to him,
"Instead of shipping

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:47.670
people to concentration camps we
want you to ship munitions

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.738
around the Third Reich to
resupply the army,"

00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:55.391
or "We want you to ship
car parts,"

00:04:55.391 --> 00:05:00.456
he would have done it with the
same zeal and desire to improve

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:03.860
his standing with his superiors.
 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.199
He wouldn't have been any
different about it.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.072
He didn't seem to be like
somebody who saw this as a great

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:16.519
opportunity to do something he
really believed in.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:20.939
He was simply trying to get an
A, trying to get ahead,

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.586
trying to impress his
superiors, do a good and

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:29.370
efficient job at whatever it was
that he was asked to do.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.449
 
 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.040
If that's an accurate
description about him it's quite

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.600
chilling, right?
 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.389
And I think this brings us to
the first question.

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.980
What is it that makes you
uncomfortable about this man?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.487
One of the things I asked you
to think about,

00:05:55.487 --> 00:06:02.290
what makes you uncomfortable
about Eichmann?

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.300
Yeah?
 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.497
Student:  The fact that he
was just basically not thinking

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:11.064
about what he was doing,
so someone else had total

00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:13.110
control of what he was going to
do.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.906
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 So his un-reflectiveness

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:17.769
is what makes you uncomfortable.
 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:19.107
Student:  Right,
because that means really

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:19.879
anyone can be like that.
 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.860
It kind of makes you reflect on
yourself and just on human

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.490
nature.
 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.423
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Okay, so you feel he

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:31.416
should have been questioning the
authorities that were giving him

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.040
the orders to do this?
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.350
Student:  Yeah,
that'd be nice.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.497
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Okay, that's definitely

00:06:35.497 --> 00:06:36.509
one thing that makes people
uncomfortable.

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.759
What else?
 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.110
Anybody else?
 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:50.199
Yeah?
 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.946
Student:  It was just that
his un-reflectiveness

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:57.625
transferred to the fact that--
well, he wanted to do his job

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.276
well,
but the fact was that he wasn't

00:07:00.276 --> 00:07:02.088
just transporting munitions.
 

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:06.153
These were people's lives,
supposedly people he easily

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:08.528
could have been friends with.
 

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.850
Prof: Right,
he wasn't thinking about the

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.689
larger purpose.
 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.730
So it's connected to the
un-reflectiveness,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.067
although we'll see that one of
the themes in this course that

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:24.478
political theorists write about
is the whole idea of detaching

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:28.021
means from ends of thinking
about how to do things

00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:33.009
efficiently without reference to
what it is that we are doing,

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.389
but it makes us uncomfortable.
 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:37.949
What else makes you
uncomfortable about this man?

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:47.550
What makes your skin crawl when
you think about him?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.129
Anything else?
 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:50.959
Yeah?
 

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:55.060
Get the microphone.
 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.709
Student:  He was gloating.
 

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.531
Like when he was in Argentina
and he was doing his interviews

00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:02.165
he was gloating about the
million of people that had died

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:04.000
because of him because of his
work.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.463
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 He was pleased that he had

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:05.959
done a good job.
 

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:06.540
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.675
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 It wasn't as if he was

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:10.810
doing this with any sense of
reluctance, right?

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.394
Even though you don't get the
sense that this man had a

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:18.444
visceral anti-Semitism about him
he certainly was pleased with

00:08:18.444 --> 00:08:22.230
the fact that his superiors
liked what he was doing,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.970
and that he was being commended
for it,

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:34.210
and he was getting ahead.
 

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.090
Anything else that makes you
uncomfortable about him?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.750
 
 

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.710
Yeah?
 

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.774
Student:  He brings up the
term idealist and he sort of

00:08:51.774 --> 00:08:54.946
attaches a sense of honor and
loyalty to the Third Reich that

00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:58.538
we find uncomfortable because of
what it's trying to accomplish.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.570
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Loyalty to his superiors.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.470
Student:  Right.
 

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.688
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 That he thought it was

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:04.230
important to obey his superiors.
 

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:10.529
Okay, somebody over there was
going to say something.

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:13.850
Yeah, over there.
 

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.375
Student:  Well,
it's not something specific

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.351
about his actions,
but I'm uncomfortable with the

00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:19.908
fact that when he is considered
normal by all the tests,

00:09:19.908 --> 00:09:22.303
and too, when he was wasn't
thinking at all he actually

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:24.831
thought he was thinking and he
fooled a lot of people into

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.740
thinking that he's smart and
competent.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.883
So it makes me wonder if that
stupidity is just something

00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:30.950
within all of us.
 

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.312
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Yeah, I think that's right

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:33.759
as well.
 

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:38.078
So here you have a man who is
completely unreflective about

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.419
what he's doing.
 

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:42.580
He's obeying orders from above.
 

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.600
He's not breaking the law,
right, at all.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.630
He's implementing the law as
it's enacted in the Third Reich

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.577
and he's going about something
that is absolutely monstrous

00:09:56.577 --> 00:09:59.990
with calm efficiency and good
humor.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.945
You could imagine this guy
going home at the end of the

00:10:04.945 --> 00:10:07.142
week,
playing with children,

00:10:07.142 --> 00:10:09.470
being friends with the
neighbors,

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.159
going to a barbecue,
and going back to work the next

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:13.370
day,
right?

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.667
One of Arendt's phrases to
capture this is that--one of the

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:21.668
things that seems so chilling
about this guy is that he

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:24.039
doesn't seem like a monster.
 

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:27.028
He seems like the man next door.
 

00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:30.105
And the phrase she uses is,
"The banality of

00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:30.940
evil."
 

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:41.269
He doesn't seem like somebody
who's got some unusual traits.

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:46.187
So I think to turn the screw a
little bit further one of the

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.606
things that makes people
uncomfortable with a man like

00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:55.024
this is it sort of makes you
wonder how would you have

00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:57.610
behaved in his situation.
 

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.441
You hope you would have not
behaved as he did,

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:06.200
but he doesn't seem that
unusual.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.788
He seems completely
unremarkable man,

00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:13.830
fairly typical guy doing what
he's,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.510
you know, putting one foot in
front of the other in the

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.466
situation in which he finds
himself and getting on with his

00:11:21.466 --> 00:11:22.080
life.
 

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.105
And that, I think,
is captured by her phrase,

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:29.308
"The banality of
evil."

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:34.150
Okay, let's now just put
Eichmann to one side for a

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:39.573
minute and think about the
second question I asked you to

00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:43.058
reflect upon while reading this.
 

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:48.913
What two things make you most
uncomfortable about the events

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:52.388
surrounding Eichmann's
apprehension,

00:11:52.388 --> 00:11:54.769
trial and execution?
 

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:57.639
First of all,
why did Israel do what it did?

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:02.730
Why do you think they went and
kidnapped him?

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:08.760
I mean, the normal process if
you're trying to get hold of a

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.025
criminal in other countries,
you go and you apply for

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.835
extradition,
and you make the case,

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:20.761
and you go to court,
and the person is arrested,

00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:24.320
and eventually they're brought
to trial.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.860
So why didn't they do that?
 

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.548
Why did they do what they did?
 

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:32.700
Anybody even know or what to
take a guess?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.620
Why did they do that?
 

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.669
 
 

00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.970
Does anyone want to try that?
 

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.048
Yeah?
 

00:12:44.048 --> 00:12:46.684
Student: Well,
it seems to imply that they

00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:49.924
might have been concerned or
might have suspected that other

00:12:49.924 --> 00:12:52.836
countries wouldn't be
sympathetic to their wish to try

00:12:52.836 --> 00:12:53.658
Eichmann.
 

00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:57.298
They might have worried that
he'd garnered a certain amount

00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:00.811
of international support or
defense in the country he was

00:13:00.811 --> 00:13:01.690
living in.
 

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.100
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 I think that's right.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.490
If they had tried to extradite
him it wouldn't have worked.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.538
As soon as he knew that there
were many other former Nazis in

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.509
Argentina and elsewhere in Latin
America,

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:16.245
the minute he realized that
they knew where he was and who

00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:19.720
he was he would have gone
underground and vanished.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.190
And there would have been so
much sand in the wheels of the

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.889
extradition system that they
made a judgment,

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:31.375
which is probably a valid
judgment that if they were going

00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:33.735
to get him at all,
this was the way they were

00:13:33.735 --> 00:13:34.480
going to get him.
 

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.029
So that's why they did it.
 

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:40.168
Pretty much that's why they did
it.

00:13:40.168 --> 00:13:46.322
Okay, so given that that's why
they did it, what if anything

00:13:46.322 --> 00:13:51.120
makes you uncomfortable about
what they did?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.649
 
 

00:13:54.649 --> 00:14:01.230
Over here we need a mic, yeah.
 

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.769
Student:  In one of the
last two chapters,

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.181
I believe, they're discussing
the reasons for judgment against

00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:09.264
him on all the counts,
and one of them she's

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:13.833
discussing the four main points
that they attempt to prove

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.000
through the prosecution.
 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.466
And in some of them they
discuss the term in dubio

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:20.081
contra reum,
which is, I guess,

00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:22.168
when in doubt act against the
defendant.

00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:26.043
And that was kind of just when
we don't have necessarily all

00:14:26.043 --> 00:14:29.129
the evidence because a lot of it
is speculative,

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:31.558
we will act in a way that
will...

00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:34.509
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, so there was not a lot of

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.570
attention to the rules of
evidence.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.649
Student: Yeah.
 

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:38.875
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Right?

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.100
Okay, so that's one thing.
 

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.148
There were a lot of what we
would think of as procedural

00:14:44.148 --> 00:14:46.429
irregularities in this trial.
 

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:50.370
Yeah?
 

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.090
Student: I was uncomfortable
with the speed of the execution.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.455
It happened extremely soon
after his appeal and plea for

00:14:57.455 --> 00:14:59.730
mercy;
within a couple of hours.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.110
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Right, it was the way

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.267
executions are done in China
today, not the way executions

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:07.870
are done in the United States
today, right?

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.778
It was very rapid.
 

00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:12.980
And why were you uncomfortable
with that?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.057
Student: I think there's no
doubt that what he did was

00:15:17.057 --> 00:15:19.679
wrong,
but you at least have to go

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:24.043
through the procedures just to
ensure that justice is actually

00:15:24.043 --> 00:15:27.006
served,
so that even if it was correct

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:29.620
that he deserved the death
penalty.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.504
I think the actual protocol
should have been followed and

00:15:33.504 --> 00:15:37.460
that he should have gotten his
time to make the appeal.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.547
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, anything else make

00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:43.500
anybody uncomfortable about what
was done?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.629
Over here, yeah?
 

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:50.869
Student: It mentioned in the
beginning how showy the trial

00:15:50.869 --> 00:15:53.195
was,
and one part that I thought

00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:56.807
really stuck with me was when
the author mentioned that

00:15:56.807 --> 00:15:59.750
Israel's laws itself prohibited
Jewish...

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.778
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Israel what,

00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:01.019
sorry?
 

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:06.009
Student: Israeli law prohibited
Jewish and non-Jewish marriage,

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:07.917
so how the two societies,
although one is certainly worse

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:09.750
than the other,
I think, on a moral level

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.460
there's still no perfect
society,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.308
and that really was kind of
disturbing, I think.

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:16.427
Professor Ian Shapiro:
So it was something of a show

00:16:16.427 --> 00:16:16.759
trial.
 

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:17.428
Student: Yeah.
 

00:16:17.428 --> 00:16:20.893
Professor Ian Shapiro:
There was more than one agenda

00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:21.360
here.
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.889
One agenda was justice,
bringing him to justice,

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:28.970
but clearly there was an agenda
of revenge,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:34.823
and there was an agenda of
catharsis for many of the people

00:16:34.823 --> 00:16:38.509
who testified,
who came there.

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:42.499
It was very important for them
personally to get up and speak

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:45.956
about what had happened to them
for which he was held

00:16:45.956 --> 00:16:47.019
responsible.
 

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:49.731
So there were multiple agendas
going on here,

00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:53.184
only one of which was what we
normally think of as what's

00:16:53.184 --> 00:16:55.590
going on in a criminal
prosecution.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.610
Anything else make anybody
uncomfortable?

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.879
Yeah, over here.
 

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:05.631
Student: The author mentioned
that Israel wouldn't have gone

00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:08.616
to the trouble of kidnapping him
if he wasn't automatically going

00:17:08.616 --> 00:17:09.690
to be found guilty.
 

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.837
It was just a foregone
conclusion from the beginning

00:17:12.837 --> 00:17:16.604
and that's just really setting
such a bad precedent for trials

00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:17.528
in general.
 

00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:20.980
So even though it wasn't clear
he was guilty the fact that it

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.798
was just--
they wouldn't have even

00:17:22.798 --> 00:17:25.451
troubled going through it if
they thought there was any

00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:28.250
possibility of him being found
innocent or not guilty.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.420
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, so the outcome was never

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:30.880
in doubt.
 

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.858
Student: Uh-huh.
 

00:17:31.858 --> 00:17:33.901
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, and that makes you

00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:34.700
nervous because?
 

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.588
Hang on.
 

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.911
Student:  Because,
well, his case is pretty black

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:43.297
and white, but that's just
setting a precedent for the

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:44.000
future.
 

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.703
And if in a case where he's so
clearly guilty you can't use

00:17:47.703 --> 00:17:50.228
real evidence,
and you can't actually go

00:17:50.228 --> 00:17:52.618
through the steps,
the meaningful steps of a trial

00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:55.226
to find him guilty,
then it seems like in the

00:17:55.226 --> 00:17:59.394
future other trials where it's
not so black and white may be

00:17:59.394 --> 00:18:02.078
made more into show trials as
well.

00:18:02.078 --> 00:18:06.164
Like he could clearly have been
found guilty in a meaningful way

00:18:06.164 --> 00:18:10.380
with real evidence and they just
kind of didn't try to do that.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.155
Prof: Okay,
anything else make anyone

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:14.190
uncomfortable?
 

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.230
Yeah, over here.
 

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.644
Student:  Also the lack of
evidence that was eligible for

00:18:21.644 --> 00:18:25.116
procurement on the side of the
defense and the lack of defense

00:18:25.116 --> 00:18:27.108
support really stuck out to me.
 

00:18:27.108 --> 00:18:29.285
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 They didn't have what we

00:18:29.285 --> 00:18:30.009
call discovery.
 

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:33.250
There was a lot of procedural
irregularities here.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.150
They didn't have access to the
evidence.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.650
There were a lot of what,
you know,

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.361
when you all go off to the law
school and you learn criminal

00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:47.015
procedure a few years from now,
there was a lot of what would

00:18:47.015 --> 00:18:49.210
be called reversible error in
this trial;

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.286
that is on appeal would have
run into trouble,

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:53.788
procedural problems.
 

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:57.048
So there were procedural
problems in the trial,

00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:57.900
what else?
 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.490
Over there, yeah?
 

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.123
Student:  It makes me
uncomfortable that Israel was

00:19:06.123 --> 00:19:09.884
even claiming jurisdiction in
the case considering the crime

00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:13.709
did not happen on Israeli soil
and that they literally had to

00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:17.151
send their secret service to
kidnap him to bring him to

00:19:17.151 --> 00:19:18.490
Israeli soil.
 

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.190
Prof: Okay,
so you are troubled that they

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.890
thought they had jurisdiction in
this matter.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.019
Student:  Right.
 

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:28.367
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Because the crime didn't

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.009
happen on Israeli soil.
 

00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:33.813
Any other reason why one might
be troubled that they claimed

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:34.779
jurisdiction?
 

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:39.048
Student:  It felt like it
was the country kind of speaking

00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:43.180
for a people or speaking for
humanity in a way that was just

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.650
unsettling to me.
 

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.490
Professor Ian Shapiro:
 Okay, that they arrogated

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.441
to themselves the right to
prosecute in the name of the

00:19:50.441 --> 00:19:53.009
Jewish people and in the name of
humanity,

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:56.769
crimes against humanity they
convicted him of,

00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:58.119
you might say.
 

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:00.730
Who appointed them to do that?
 

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.327
I think there's a lot of truth
to what you say there,

00:20:05.327 --> 00:20:10.278
but there are a number of other
aspects to it as well.

00:20:10.278 --> 00:20:13.932
Why else might we be troubled
that they thought they had

00:20:13.932 --> 00:20:15.660
jurisdiction to do this?
 

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.230
What does jurisdiction mean
anyway?

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.680
What is jurisdiction?
 

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.730
Yeah?
 

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.981
Student:  I think it's
equally troubling that they

00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:32.390
thought that they had to do
this.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.317
I mean, they talked a lot about
the way that former Nazis are

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:38.440
being tried in Germany and how
lenient their punishments were.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.054
I think that that is kind of
the need of the German people to

00:20:43.054 --> 00:20:44.711
kind of,
I don't know,

00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:47.271
kind of like,
twist history in that way to

00:20:47.271 --> 00:20:51.018
kind of take blame away from
these people who obviously did a

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:52.578
lot of things wrong.
 

00:20:52.578 --> 00:20:56.186
In a way force Israel to have
to kind of take this very like

00:20:56.186 --> 00:20:58.450
drastic sort of extra legal
action.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.928
Prof: Okay,
but so I think you all make a

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:04.967
number of valid points,
but somebody would say,

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:07.857
a devil's advocate would say,
"Well, look,

00:21:07.857 --> 00:21:11.176
nobody's seriously alleging
that he was incorrectly

00:21:11.176 --> 00:21:12.038
convicted.
 

00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:15.108
Nobody's seriously alleging
that he didn't do this."

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:19.395
We've already said by
assumption that they were

00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:24.800
working on the premise that if
they didn't prosecute him it

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.970
wasn't going to happen at all.
 

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.950
So what's there to be that
troubled about?

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:41.750
 
 

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:47.980
Is there a counter argument to
that?

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.088
Yeah, over there.
 

00:21:53.088 --> 00:21:55.538
Student:  Next time it
might not be so clear.

00:21:55.538 --> 00:21:58.368
Another country might use this
as a precedent for themselves.

00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:01.001
Prof: Okay,
so there's a precedent issue,

00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:03.858
and what are the precedent's
we're worried about?

00:22:03.858 --> 00:22:08.023
Student:  The precedent
of claiming jurisdiction over

00:22:08.023 --> 00:22:11.200
any number of crimes that occur
elsewhere,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.576
the precedent of basically
kidnapping in order to have a

00:22:16.576 --> 00:22:20.396
legal system,
the precedent of show trials

00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:22.009
for serious crimes.
 

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:25.028
Prof: And it's
potentially a huge issue.

00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:29.986
I don't know if you noticed
Israeli politician Livni

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:35.233
canceled a trip to Britain a few
weeks ago because they

00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:41.355
discovered that some prosecutor
in Britain was going to have her

00:22:41.355 --> 00:22:45.048
arrested for war crimes in Gaza.
 

00:22:45.048 --> 00:22:50.468
She had been foreign minister
during the Gaza invasion a year

00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:51.009
ago.
 

00:22:51.009 --> 00:22:54.165
And the British government was
very embarrassed and they were

00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:57.058
trying to fix it so that that
couldn't be done again.

00:22:57.058 --> 00:23:01.544
But Pinochet couldn't travel to
many places because he was

00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:04.220
eventually going to be arrested.
 

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.453
There are some countries in
which there are conversations

00:23:09.453 --> 00:23:15.061
about whether they might try and
arrest Donald Rumsfeld if he

00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:19.828
travels to them for what went on
at Abu Ghraib.

00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:25.387
So if countries start setting
themselves up and saying we have

00:23:25.387 --> 00:23:30.673
the right to prosecute war
criminals, how is it going to be

00:23:30.673 --> 00:23:31.950
regulated?
 

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.009
Who are they going to be
answerable to?

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:40.907
It might look okay in this case
because nobody seriously

00:23:40.907 --> 00:23:47.556
contends that Eichmann didn't do
these things or that they were

00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:52.432
justifiable,
but there's this precedent

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:57.599
setting issue that you have to
worry about.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:58.538
Anything else?
 

00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:03.828
Anything I haven't mentioned
that you might find troubling?

00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:06.009
I mean, might somebody not say,
"Look,

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:13.650
it's not just that it wasn't on
Israeli soil,

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.980
this guy's being prosecuted by
a legal system which didn't even

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.250
exist when he committed his
crimes,

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.134
and furthermore he was obeying
a legal system that did

00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:29.068
exist," right?
 

00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:35.190
He was in Germany in the 1940s
obeying the laws of the Third

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.019
Reich.
 

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:40.144
He wasn't breaking any laws
then, and now he's being tried

00:24:40.144 --> 00:24:44.559
in a legal system in a country
that didn't even exist then for

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.368
violating other laws.
 

00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:50.839
Isn't this just victor's
justice?

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:57.089
 
 

00:24:57.089 --> 00:24:58.410
So what do we say about that?
 

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.039
Did they do the wrong thing?
 

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:06.960
 
 

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.090
A lot of people,
I think, would grant much of

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.432
what's been said here and still
be troubled by the notion that

00:25:14.432 --> 00:25:18.630
they shouldn't have done it
because he would never have been

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.410
brought to justice.
 

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:27.252
Okay, now let's take a step
back from this conversation and

00:25:27.252 --> 00:25:33.269
bring in what we were doing in
the first half of our

00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:35.038
discussion.
 

00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:38.981
Don't you think there's a
tension now between the two

00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:41.029
halves of our discussion?
 

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:45.071
Because when we were talking
about what made us uncomfortable

00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:48.104
about Eichmann it was his
abdicating his moral

00:25:48.104 --> 00:25:51.538
responsibility to question the
prevailing law,

00:25:51.538 --> 00:25:59.000
to question the legitimacy of
what he was being asked to do,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.295
his un-reflectiveness,
his lack of interest in the

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:08.028
overall goals of the enterprise
that he was part of.

00:26:08.028 --> 00:26:11.647
This completely unreflective
person doing what he was told to

00:26:11.647 --> 00:26:12.547
do,
obeying orders,

00:26:12.547 --> 00:26:14.230
trying to please his superiors
and get ahead,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.068
that's what made us
uncomfortable.

00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:21.659
But now when we talk about what
Israel did in 1960 it seems like

00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:26.894
what makes you uncomfortable
there is the fact that they did

00:26:26.894 --> 00:26:29.288
do all of those things.
 

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:31.981
They sat down and they said,
"Well, yeah,

00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:34.973
there's international law,
and there's extradition,

00:26:34.973 --> 00:26:36.589
but hey, you know what?
 

00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:37.900
It's not going to happen.
 

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:43.238
And if we want to get the
morally correct outcome here we

00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:49.148
have to take it upon ourselves
not to accept the existing rules

00:26:49.148 --> 00:26:52.895
of the game,
not to accept the existing

00:26:52.895 --> 00:26:56.740
order, but to stand up for
what's right."

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.154
So how is it that we on the one
hand are uncomfortable with

00:27:01.154 --> 00:27:07.051
Eichmann for failing to do that,
but here we're uncomfortable

00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:14.210
when these Israeli commandos and
prosecutors do exactly that?

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.829
Is that a real contradiction or
am I missing something?

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:23.410
Anybody want to pick up that?
 

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.759
 
 

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:32.368
What do you think?
 

00:27:32.368 --> 00:27:34.714
Student: So I do think it's a
contradiction and very worth

00:27:34.714 --> 00:27:37.183
examining,
but one sort of interesting

00:27:37.183 --> 00:27:41.340
aspect of it is just that I
think part of what we object to

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.996
about the trial is that it
claimed to be following a

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:50.096
certain legal order,
and that it sort of associated

00:27:50.096 --> 00:27:55.170
this working outside the system
with a system.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.308
Professor Ian Shapiro:
So what is that legal order?

00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:59.797
Student: With the Israeli legal
system, I mean,

00:27:59.797 --> 00:28:04.118
with the judicial court system
of the nation of Israel.

00:28:04.118 --> 00:28:06.821
Professor Ian Shapiro:
I take your point,

00:28:06.821 --> 00:28:08.848
but it's not very plausible.
 

00:28:08.848 --> 00:28:11.078
It's not the best defense
because after all,

00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:14.308
as has come up in this
conversation,

00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:19.182
even by the standards of
existing Israeli law was not a

00:28:19.182 --> 00:28:21.348
great conducted trial.
 

00:28:21.348 --> 00:28:22.557
Student: Right,
but what I'm saying is that

00:28:22.557 --> 00:28:25.028
this trial,
which clearly broke a lot of

00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:29.311
what we would consider the good
standards for trial sort of

00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:33.670
tainted somehow the idea of the
Israeli judicial system.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.759
I'm not saying this would have
been better,

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:41.358
but some of our objections
wouldn't necessarily apply if it

00:28:41.358 --> 00:28:45.781
had been really obviously,
just like a political

00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:48.803
assassination,
because they didn't know what

00:28:48.803 --> 00:28:49.818
else to do with him.
 

00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:53.960
I mean, not that that would be
acceptable either necessarily,

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.825
but just the relation of this
to the courts gets in there

00:28:57.825 --> 00:28:58.930
somehow too.
 

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.686
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, so that might speak to

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:03.442
part of it,
but anything else about this

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:08.128
tension between on the one hand
we're worried that Eichmann

00:29:08.128 --> 00:29:12.250
abdicated his moral autonomy and
responsibility.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.763
On the other hand we're
uncomfortable that they asserted

00:29:15.763 --> 00:29:16.339
theirs.
 

00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:18.000
Yeah?
 

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.344
Student: Well,
I'm not really quite sure the

00:29:20.344 --> 00:29:23.560
tension completely exists if
we're to assume that one system

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.960
of government or one system of
laws is,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.259
like, legitimate and valid like
the Israeli trial system.

00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:34.230
Like having a system that lets
you have appeals,

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.685
that doesn't kidnap people
illegally versus a system that

00:29:39.685 --> 00:29:45.337
kills millions of people who are
innocent of doing anything

00:29:45.337 --> 00:29:48.416
wrong,
and kills them simply for who

00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:49.108
they are.
 

00:29:49.108 --> 00:29:53.372
So in Eichmann's case it seems
to me that it is legitimate to

00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:56.141
challenge him,
to challenge the system,

00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:59.522
and to be shocked or
disappointed when he doesn't and

00:29:59.522 --> 00:30:01.278
just goes along with it.
 

00:30:01.278 --> 00:30:03.972
On the other hand,
to bring someone like that to

00:30:03.972 --> 00:30:07.470
justice it is a bit troubling
that when you have a system that

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:11.182
does work,
or that we widely believe to be

00:30:11.182 --> 00:30:16.890
a judicial system that does work
and is sort of widely accepted

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.500
to be a good system,
setting a precedent there could

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.670
be potentially a bad thing.
 

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.308
I'm not quite sure there's a
tension if in one case,

00:30:26.308 --> 00:30:29.309
challenging the system is good,
and in the other maybe

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:32.650
challenging the system has more
of a gray area of issues.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.150
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Well, I think you've hit the

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.720
nail on the head.
 

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.009
I think that the tension goes
away if we say,

00:30:39.009 --> 00:30:44.429
"Well, the reason we are
troubled by Eichmann's failure

00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:50.123
to ask any questions about what
he was being asked to do within

00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:54.807
the legal order of the Third
Reich is that it was an

00:30:54.807 --> 00:30:58.390
illegitimate illegal
order."

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:03.131
It was as Arendt says somewhere
in there, it was a criminal

00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:08.117
regime, and it was his failure
to recognize that that makes us

00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:09.588
uncomfortable.
 

00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:12.375
On the other hand,
when we start talking about the

00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:15.939
system of international law,
it has its imperfections,

00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:20.258
but we're much more ambivalent
about saying people can ignore

00:31:20.258 --> 00:31:23.920
it with impunity,
because we don't see it as an

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.480
illegitimate order in the same
way that we did.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.507
So I think you're exactly right
when you point out that this is

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:34.210
not a real tension.
 

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.643
It's an apparent tension,
appearing to be a tension on

00:31:38.643 --> 00:31:43.411
the fact that most of us don't
have any qualms in thinking

00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:48.011
about the Third Reich as an
illegitimate regime and that

00:31:48.011 --> 00:31:52.529
that's why we're uncomfortable
with his actions.

00:31:52.529 --> 00:31:57.058
Whereas, when you do have at
least a fledgling legitimate

00:31:57.058 --> 00:32:01.913
international legal order we
become uncomfortable with people

00:32:01.913 --> 00:32:03.450
who flout that.
 

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.838
So I think that's right,
but it places the central

00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:12.497
question of this course into
sharp relief because our

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:14.673
question is,
"Well, what is it that

00:32:14.673 --> 00:32:15.858
makes a regime legitimate or
illegitimate?"

00:32:15.858 --> 00:32:19.578
If we say you have an
obligation to resist an

00:32:19.578 --> 00:32:23.635
illegitimate regime and to obey
a legitimate one,

00:32:23.635 --> 00:32:28.368
that just pushes the question
one step further back.

00:32:28.368 --> 00:32:31.450
What is it that makes a regime
legitimate?

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.950
And that is the question that
we're going to organize our

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.960
discussion around in the coming
weeks and months.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.875
We're basically going to
explore five answers to that

00:32:45.875 --> 00:32:48.526
question,
or five types of answers,

00:32:48.526 --> 00:32:51.740
or five classes of answers to
that question,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.568
and they represent the main
ways in which political

00:32:55.568 --> 00:32:59.935
legitimacy has been thought
about in the western tradition

00:32:59.935 --> 00:33:03.000
over the past several hundred
years.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.747
The first one that we're going
to look at is the utilitarian

00:33:06.747 --> 00:33:07.509
tradition.
 

00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:12.493
And the utilitarian tradition,
which we're going to trace back

00:33:12.493 --> 00:33:16.749
to Jeremy Bentham,
who we'll start talking about

00:33:16.749 --> 00:33:19.602
on Friday,
says that a regime is

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:25.095
legitimate to the extent that it
maximizes the greatest happiness

00:33:25.095 --> 00:33:28.700
of the greatest number of its
citizens.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.702
Now, there are huge arguments
within the utilitarian tradition

00:33:34.702 --> 00:33:39.606
as to what counts as happiness,
how you measure it,

00:33:39.606 --> 00:33:44.364
what you do if promoting the
happiness of some comes at the

00:33:44.364 --> 00:33:47.480
expense of the happiness of
others.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.086
All of those things get argued
about endlessly in the

00:33:52.086 --> 00:33:56.428
utilitarian tradition,
and we will explore some of

00:33:56.428 --> 00:33:59.529
those arguments as we go along.
 

00:33:59.529 --> 00:34:04.792
But the basic idea is that good
regimes, legitimate regimes

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:09.693
maximize the utility or the
happiness of people who are

00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:11.510
subject to them.
 

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:20.010
And then the second set of
answers,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.306
the second tradition we're
going to look at is the Marxist

00:34:23.306 --> 00:34:27.010
tradition which comes into its
own in the nineteenth century,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.291
and that basically identifies
the legitimacy of the state with

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:34.239
the presence or absence of
exploitation.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:38.380
Legitimate governments are
those that try to prevent

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.708
exploitation,
and illegitimate governments

00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:45.199
are those that facilitate
exploitation.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:48.865
Again, just as in the
utilitarian tradition there are

00:34:48.865 --> 00:34:53.590
huge disagreements about how to
identify utility and measure it,

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:58.000
in the Marxian tradition,
from the beginning,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.126
there have been huge
disagreements about what

00:35:00.126 --> 00:35:02.780
constitutes exploitation,
how you would know it when you

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.704
see it,
what would be involved in

00:35:04.704 --> 00:35:08.293
eradicating it,
and how governments might or

00:35:08.293 --> 00:35:11.018
might not be able to do that.
 

00:35:11.018 --> 00:35:16.585
But at the end of the day it is
the presence of exploitation

00:35:16.585 --> 00:35:21.018
that is the marker of an
illegitimate order,

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:24.021
and it's the possibility of
escaping exploitation that

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.739
creates the possibility of a
legitimate order.

00:35:26.739 --> 00:35:32.393
And so the Marxian answer to
the question of legitimacy

00:35:32.393 --> 00:35:37.000
revolves around this idea of
exploitation.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.623
The third tradition we're going
to look at is what's commonly

00:35:40.623 --> 00:35:43.159
known as the social contract
tradition,

00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:48.103
and the social contract
tradition founds the legitimacy

00:35:48.103 --> 00:35:52.590
of a political order in the
notion of consent,

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.929
agreement.
 

00:35:54.929 --> 00:35:59.820
Again, you'll find just as with
all these other traditions a lot

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:03.547
of disagreement about what
constitutes agreement,

00:36:03.547 --> 00:36:05.800
what constitutes consent.
 

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.681
Is it some people who actually
agreed at some point in the past

00:36:11.681 --> 00:36:13.768
that should bind us?
 

00:36:13.768 --> 00:36:17.237
The American founders agreed on
certain things and therefore we

00:36:17.237 --> 00:36:19.699
should be bound by what they
agreed upon,

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:24.840
or is it what any rational
person would agree to?

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.030
Is it a hypothetical idea of
consent?

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.659
Does the consent have to be
active?

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:35.340
Do people actually have to
engage in consent or can it be

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.010
tacit?
 

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.590
Can you demonstrate your
consent simply by not leaving?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.268
All of these issues will get a
lot of attention when we look at

00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:47.847
the social contract tradition,
but for all of their internal

00:36:47.847 --> 00:36:54.025
differences and disagreements
the social contract tradition

00:36:54.025 --> 00:37:00.521
comes down to the proposition
that the legitimacy of the state

00:37:00.521 --> 00:37:05.420
is rooted in the consent of the
governed.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.487
The fourth tradition we're
going to consider is what I call

00:37:10.487 --> 00:37:15.030
in the syllabus the
anti-Enlightenment tradition,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.840
reacting against those first
three Enlightenment traditions,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.320
and the anti-Enlightenment
tradition appeals to tradition.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.429
It's the tradition.
 

00:37:25.429 --> 00:37:32.514
The legitimacy of the state
resides in, is discovered in the

00:37:32.514 --> 00:37:37.918
inherited norms,
practices and traditions of a

00:37:37.918 --> 00:37:39.360
society.
 

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.289
Again, we will find people
struggling with and arguing over

00:37:44.289 --> 00:37:47.889
what constitutes a tradition,
how you will know a tradition

00:37:47.889 --> 00:37:50.907
when you trip over it,
what happens when people

00:37:50.907 --> 00:37:55.010
disagree about what the
tradition implies.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:38:00.324
All those questions are on the
table once we start appealing to

00:38:00.324 --> 00:38:04.358
tradition,
but at the end of the day it is

00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:09.539
the appeal to tradition itself
that becomes important;

00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:15.128
that when you criticize a
government you have to appeal to

00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:21.210
something that is imminent in
and accepted in the tradition.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:26.831
The rights of Englishmen,
let's say, as it was appealed

00:38:26.831 --> 00:38:30.059
to in the eighteenth century.
 

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:33.054
And then there's a tradition
about what the rights of

00:38:33.054 --> 00:38:36.507
Englishmen are thought to have
been going all the way back to

00:38:36.507 --> 00:38:37.429
Magna Carta.
 

00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:41.425
That becomes the basis for
arguing about the legitimacy of

00:38:41.425 --> 00:38:44.230
the present actions of the
government.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.900
The fifth tradition we're going
to look at is the democratic

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.105
tradition,
and the democratic tradition

00:38:51.105 --> 00:38:56.494
says that the legitimacy of the
state depends upon the extent to

00:38:56.494 --> 00:39:01.371
which it obeys something which
we'll call the principle of

00:39:01.371 --> 00:39:03.340
affected interest.
 

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.556
That is whether those people
whose interests are affected by

00:39:07.556 --> 00:39:10.559
its actions get to control what
it does.

00:39:10.559 --> 00:39:14.429
Close cousin of consent you
might say,

00:39:14.429 --> 00:39:17.791
and indeed the democratic
tradition is a close cousin of

00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:21.956
the social contract tradition,
but at the end of the day it's

00:39:21.956 --> 00:39:25.389
a different tradition and often
works through,

00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:29.949
but not always,
the idea of majority rule.

00:39:29.949 --> 00:39:33.409
And so, again,
in the democratic tradition

00:39:33.409 --> 00:39:38.387
there are huge controversies
about how we operationalize and

00:39:38.387 --> 00:39:42.690
apply this idea of affected
interest as the basis of

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.719
politics,
but the underlying notion is

00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:48.059
that if you can resolve those
issues,

00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:56.693
trying to make the government
the agent of people who are

00:39:56.693 --> 00:40:02.831
affected by what it does,
is the name of the game in

00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:06.688
promoting legitimacy and
undermining illegitimacy of the

00:40:06.688 --> 00:40:07.320
state.
 

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.974
So those are the five
traditions we're going to

00:40:10.974 --> 00:40:11.768
explore.
 

00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:13.639
We're going to come back again
and again,

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:19.260
not only to the Eichmann
problem, but to other practical

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.679
examples that throw this
question of the legitimacy of

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:27.949
the state into sharp relief.
 

00:40:27.949 --> 00:40:33.039
But at the end of the day we're
always trying to understand what

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:37.000
the basis for political
legitimacy actually is.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.454
We have a couple of minutes for
questions if anyone would like

00:40:42.454 --> 00:40:43.079
to...
 

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:47.409
 
 

00:40:47.409 --> 00:40:49.820
Yeah, mic over here.
 

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:55.340
 
 

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.235
Student:  What about the
notion that might makes right

00:40:58.235 --> 00:41:00.889
and that the most powerful stays
the most legitimate?

00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:03.501
Prof: Okay,
he says, "What about the

00:41:03.501 --> 00:41:06.557
notion that might makes right
and it's the most powerful

00:41:06.557 --> 00:41:09.670
states that get to dictate what
legitimacy is?"

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.070
I mean, you could say that.
 

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.177
After all, if you think about
the example we've been

00:41:15.177 --> 00:41:16.789
considering today.
 

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:21.440
At the end of the Second World
War we had the Nuremberg Trials

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.719
run by an American Supreme Court
justice.

00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:26.230
They went to Germany.
 

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.820
They did a lot of what Israel
did in 1960, actually.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.793
They tried these Germans by
laws that hadn't existed at the

00:41:33.793 --> 00:41:37.699
time for obeying the laws that
had existed at the time.

00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:38.940
Many of them were executed.
 

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.750
Many of them were in prison.
 

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:45.820
You could say this is just
might makes right.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.708
If somebody else had won the
war there would have been a

00:41:48.708 --> 00:41:49.760
different outcome.
 

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.179
So this is a doctrine which we
will consider in the course of

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.570
our discussion,
actually, on utilitarianism.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.775
It is, for those of you who
want the jargon,

00:42:01.775 --> 00:42:05.199
the doctrine of legal
positivism.

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:10.769
Anyone want to take a crack at
what legal positivism means?

00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:12.230
Anybody know?
 

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.519
No reason you should know.
 

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:16.760
 
 

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.922
Legal positivism was the
doctrine that said exactly what

00:42:21.922 --> 00:42:25.489
this gentleman here has been
saying;

00:42:25.489 --> 00:42:31.900
that what makes something law
is the ability to get people to

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.969
obey it.
 

00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:40.211
If you go back into Medieval
Europe we'll find a distinction

00:42:40.211 --> 00:42:45.000
between natural law and positive
law.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.739
Natural law is sometimes
identified with the will of God,

00:42:46.739 --> 00:42:50.268
sometimes with timeless
universal moral principles,

00:42:50.268 --> 00:42:56.789
some higher law by reference to
which we judge what actual legal

00:42:56.789 --> 00:42:58.860
systems are doing.
 

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.690
So when we say the Third Reich
was a criminal regime,

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.210
an illegitimate regime,
we're ultimately appealing to

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.815
some kind of higher law,
some natural law idea as to

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:12.130
what constitutes a legitimate
regime,

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.579
right?
 

00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:17.329
And we're going to talk a lot
more about natural law later.

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:21.539
Well, legal positivism was the
doctrine that there's no such

00:43:21.539 --> 00:43:23.179
thing as natural law.
 

00:43:23.179 --> 00:43:25.182
Jeremy Bentham,
who we're going to start

00:43:25.182 --> 00:43:28.523
talking about on Friday,
says, "Natural law,

00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:31.860
natural rights it's dangerous
nonsense,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.960
nonsense on stilts.
 

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.110
There's no such thing as
natural law."

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:43.340
And he is considered as one of
the intellectual sources for

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.213
this doctrine of legal
positivism, which comes into its

00:43:48.213 --> 00:43:51.280
own in the nineteenth century.
 

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.862
If you say, well,
there is no higher law then the

00:43:55.862 --> 00:44:00.349
question is, well,
then what is law based on?

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:02.070
One answer is power.
 

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.510
Bentham wanted to say it should
be based on science.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.277
As I mentioned to you last
time, the Enlightenment is all

00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:10.960
about faith in science.
 

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:16.822
So we will consider a version
of that argument when we come to

00:44:16.822 --> 00:44:22.449
talk about utilitarianism,
but it's a good point to make

00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:27.639
particularly in the context of
the Eichmann problem.

00:44:27.639 --> 00:44:32.355
Now, what we're going to do,
I realize now I misspoke when I

00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:36.351
said we were going to talk about
Bentham on Friday,

00:44:36.351 --> 00:44:37.389
didn't I?
 

00:44:37.389 --> 00:44:41.045
Why didn't some astute person
say, "No,

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:42.659
you're not."
 

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:45.579
We're actually going to talk
about Locke.

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:47.436
Now, you might say,
"Well, why are you going

00:44:47.436 --> 00:44:48.518
to talk about Locke?"
 

00:44:48.518 --> 00:44:53.710
And the answer is that Locke
actually performs two different

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:57.670
functions in this course that
you will see.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:02.010
They come together later on.
 

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.510
You'll see how they come
together later in the course.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:10.592
But Locke, on the one hand,
we're using as somebody to

00:45:10.592 --> 00:45:15.865
provide us with a way of
understanding the Enlightenment

00:45:15.865 --> 00:45:17.880
move in politics.
 

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.865
And as I said to you,
the Enlightenment move involves

00:45:22.865 --> 00:45:28.333
a twin commitment to the ideas
of science as the basis for

00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:33.800
social organization and freedom
as the highest good,

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.760
and that that Enlightenment
pair of assumptions is going to

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.766
inform the first three
traditions we look at,

00:45:40.766 --> 00:45:41.449
right?
 

00:45:41.449 --> 00:45:45.902
The utilitarian tradition,
the Marxian tradition and the

00:45:45.902 --> 00:45:48.170
social contract tradition.
 

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:52.097
Locke will also be looked at
later as a representative of the

00:45:52.097 --> 00:45:53.929
social contract tradition.
 

00:45:53.929 --> 00:45:57.708
But what we're going to do in
Friday's lecture is think about

00:45:57.708 --> 00:46:00.289
the broad themes of the
Enlightenment,

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:05.864
for which the Locke reading is
there and it's going to provide

00:46:05.864 --> 00:46:10.353
the background,
and we will not actually get to

00:46:10.353 --> 00:46:13.750
utilitarianism until next
Wednesday.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:19.795
One thing I would say to you
about the Locke going in--on the

00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:24.130
one hand it's a tremendously
famous book.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:28.090
It's been in print continuously
for more than 300 years.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.623
It's been translated into all
the world's languages--all of

00:46:31.623 --> 00:46:35.036
the world's major languages and
many of the world's minor

00:46:35.036 --> 00:46:35.889
languages.
 

00:46:35.889 --> 00:46:40.579
Locke's most important
political writing for sure.

00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:44.429
It's not a fast read.
 

00:46:44.429 --> 00:46:48.710
It's a political pamphlet.
 

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.557
It was written for a very
particular political purpose

00:46:51.557 --> 00:46:53.599
that I'll tell you something
about,

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:57.402
but it's not a fast read in the
sense that what you read for

00:46:57.402 --> 00:47:00.987
today is a fast read,
and some of it's going to go

00:47:00.987 --> 00:47:03.170
right by you and that's okay.
 

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:07.570
Because you might think,
"Well, not only is it not

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.869
a fast read, but he's going to
do a lot of this in one lecture.

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:15.536
It seems like a lot to do in
fifty minutes,"

00:47:15.536 --> 00:47:18.817
but the truth is we're going to
come back to Locke again and

00:47:18.817 --> 00:47:22.512
again through this course,
and what you're going to

00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:27.447
discover is that the ghost of
Locke is hovering behind us all

00:47:27.447 --> 00:47:29.010
the way through.
 

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:34.018
In many ways modern democratic
theory is a footnote to Locke,

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.688
and so you'll see we'll
consider Locke as a father of

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:40.701
the Enlightenment,
as a representative of the

00:47:40.701 --> 00:47:44.594
social contract tradition,
and then Lockean considerations

00:47:44.594 --> 00:47:47.489
will come in to the Marxist
tradition,

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:51.931
to the democratic tradition,
to the social contract

00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:53.710
tradition as well.
 

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:59.070
So some of what you read for
Friday will go by you.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:03.193
Don't worry about it because
we're going to revisit Locke

00:48:03.193 --> 00:48:06.579
again, and again,
and again as we go though the

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:07.389
course.
 

00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:11.110
Okay, so we will see you on
Friday and then that's when

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.800
we'll begin talking about John
Locke.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.000

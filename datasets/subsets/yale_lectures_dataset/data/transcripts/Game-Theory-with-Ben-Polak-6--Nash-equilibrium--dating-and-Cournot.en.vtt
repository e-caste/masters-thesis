00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.318
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so last time we were

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:09.007
talking about The Investor Game
and this was a coordination

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:10.630
game,
and we learned some things.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.918
I just want to recall some of
the things we learned so I can

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:16.213
highlight them a bit.
One thing we learned was that

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:20.110
communication can help in a
coordination game.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.794
So I forget who it was,
but someone down here who has

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.619
disappeared, was our Jimmy
Stewart character and helped

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.728
coordinate you on a better
equilibrium simply by suggesting

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:36.440
what you should do.
There are two lessons here.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:48.060
One is this is very different
from the Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.864
So we learned the very first
time that in the Prisoner's

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.770
Dilemma communication per se
won't help,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.308
but in the coordination
problem, which could be just as

00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.330
serious socially as a Prisoner's
Dilemma,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.380
in a coordination problem it
may well help.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.707
The reason it helps is you're
trying to coordinate onto a Nash

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:10.685
Equilibrium.
One way to think about Nash

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.260
Equilibria is that they are
self-enforcing agreements,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.543
so provided that everyone
believes that everyone is going

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:21.280
to go along with this agreement,
then everyone in fact will.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.236
I want to make another,
slightly more philosophical

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:27.664
remark associated with this and
it's to do with the idea of

00:01:27.664 --> 00:01:30.180
"leadership."
So leadership is kind of a big

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050
word that you see written
probably too often these days,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.316
in too many newspaper articles,
and it probably comes up in too

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.995
many Yale classes,
and I don't claim to know

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:41.819
anything about leadership.
And I don't think Game Theory

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.883
is going to contribute to
anything to understanding about

00:01:43.883 --> 00:01:47.319
leadership.
But one thing we can do is tell

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.667
you where leadership may help.
In the coordination game,

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.921
where the idea is to try and
get people to coordinate on a

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.290
particular equilibria rather
than on another equilibria,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.799
or worse still,
to be uncoordinated entirely.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.541
In those kind of games,
leadership can help

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.989
tremendously.
A little bit of leadership can

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.752
help tremendously.
So these games,

00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:15.983
these coordination games,
are games where there is a

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:20.522
"scope for leadership."
Just to see that in a very

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:22.672
simple example,
again, we don't use such a

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.659
complicated example as the one
we looked at last time,

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.016
you could imagine a game,
a really trivial coordination

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:38.490
game, which looked like this
(1,1) (0,0) (0,0) (1,1).

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.139
And clearly in this game what
matters is coordinating.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.566
You either want to coordinate
on up left or you want to

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:51.414
coordinate on down right.
You don't want to end up

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:56.640
uncoordinated on down left or up
right.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.753
Everyone see that?
So in this game if you just

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:01.131
played it, it's quite likely
you're going to end up

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.641
uncoordinated,
but if you have a little bit of

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.661
leadership can say okay let's
make sure this is where we

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:09.089
coordinate,
or let's make sure this is

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.539
where we coordinate.
So this matters a lot.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.306
And I don't want to overplay
the social importance of this,

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:19.007
but go back a couple of years
to what was happening in the

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:22.968
aftermath of Katrina and realize
how important--how bad things

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:25.889
get when things fail to be
coordinated.

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.763
One other remark before we
leave this, in the game we

00:03:28.763 --> 00:03:31.139
played last time,
in the investment game,

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.912
one feature of that game was
that the more you thought other

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:39.220
people were going to invest,
the more you wanted to invest.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.337
The more you thought other
people were going to invest,

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:43.220
the more likely that you were
going to invest.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.746
If you go back to the time
before that, we talked about

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:48.205
this partnership game.
In the partnership game you

00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:50.430
were contributing effort to a
joint project.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.840
It could have been a law firm;
it could have been working in

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.710
the study group on a homework
assignment.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.871
In that game,
if you remember what the best

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:01.560
responses looked like,
they looked like this where

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.080
this was the effort of Player 1;
this was the effort of Player 2.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.778
This was the best response of
Player 1 and this was the best

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:12.910
response of Player 2.
This game also has the feature

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.066
that the more effort the other
person--the more the other

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.319
person does--the more you want
to do.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.720
The more effort your partner
provides into this project the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.790
more effort you want to provide
in this project.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.839
I just want to introduce a bit
of jargon here.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.941
These games in which the more
the other person does the more I

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:33.110
want to do, these are called
games of strategic complements.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:44.149
These are games of strategic
complements.

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.780
So both the investment game and
the game with--the partnership

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.500
firm game are games with
strategic complements.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500
We could call the strategies
strategic complements.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.540
We'll come back to this later
on today.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.396
So before we leave coordination
games, I want to look at another

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:06.211
one, a little bit more
complicated one perhaps,

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.660
that we mentioned briefly last
time.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.493
So we'll look at and play
another game,

00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:22.170
and we'll call this game,
"Going to the Movies."

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.155
So I always regard one purpose
of this class to help hapless

00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:29.060
Yale students in their dating
strategies.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.830
That seems like a good thing to
do.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.568
How many of you are Econ majors?
There's a lot of people who

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:41.550
probably need a lot of help with
their dating strategies,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.835
right?
Okay, so the idea of this game

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.230
is a couple is going to meet up
at the movies.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.561
And let's have a look at the
movies concerned here and we'll

00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:59.639
draw--there's three possible
movies.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.809
The movies we're going to look
at are The Bourne

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:12.832
Ultimatum,
and the movie called Good

00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:17.861
Shepherd,
and a movie called Snow

00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:24.240
White and I'll explain the
game in more detail in a second.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.027
Now, it used to be in the old
days before I had kids,

00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:30.082
I could list off 15 current
movies and help you a bit more

00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:32.869
with your dating strategy by
giving you instant movie

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:34.757
reviews,
but now I have kids,

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:37.033
I get to see precisely two
movies a year,

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:40.390
and the two movies I got to see
this year were The Bourne

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.689
Ultimatum and the Good
Shepherd. And now I think

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.590
about it,
both of those have Matt Damon

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.009
in it.
My wife chose both so maybe I

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.135
need to work out some more.
So just to give you some idea

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:54.881
about these movies,
how many of you saw Bourne

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.259
Ultimatum?
Quite a lot of you;

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.779
this is a movie,
it has pretty good action,

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.666
virtually no plot.
Basic lesson of this movie

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:05.104
is--if you take home a
lesson--it's that all spies are

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:08.541
psychos or something like that.
Then how many of you saw

00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.470
Good Shepherd?
A lot of you saw that as well.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.008
It's actually pretty good.
It has a lot of plot and no

00:07:13.008 --> 00:07:15.230
action, so it's the other way
around.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.816
The basic lesson of this movie
is--and you probably knew this

00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:26.589
already--everyone at Yale is a
spy â€¦ and by the way also

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.783
a psycho.
The third movie is Snow

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:34.514
White, which I haven't gone
out to see but my four-year old

00:07:34.514 --> 00:07:38.940
daughter has seen on 24 of the
last 27 nights on video.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.204
And this movie,
I don't know if I would

00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:44.183
recommend it that much,
it's--perhaps I'm being too

00:07:44.183 --> 00:07:47.519
PC--but I'm not convinced that
for the modern woman,

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:51.902
hanging around waiting for your
prince to come is really a good

00:07:51.902 --> 00:07:53.743
strategy.
By the way, for those of

00:07:53.743 --> 00:07:56.269
you--those of you who are,
if you are doing that strategy,

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:58.602
got me in trouble.
Never mind, if you are doing

00:07:58.602 --> 00:08:00.305
that strategy,
take it from a Brit,

00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.310
most princes are as dumb as
toast, not worth waiting for.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.699
So let's put the payoffs in
here.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.866
So the idea here is that these
people are going to meet at the

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:10.149
movie, they're going to go out
to a movie.

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.647
And they've decided to go to
the Criterion [New Haven movie

00:08:12.647 --> 00:08:14.240
theatre], or the local movie
house,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.276
and there were these three
movies showing,

00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:19.306
and they're all excited about
going to this movie except being

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:21.740
Economics majors and not very
good at dating,

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.771
they have forgotten to tell
each other which movie they're

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:29.943
actually going to go to.
They're going to meet in there

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:34.843
on the--in the back row probably
and--but they're not telling us

00:08:34.843 --> 00:08:37.778
which movie.
So that's a problem and let's

00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:40.645
put in the payoffs,
and we'll put in the payoffs

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.000
that roughly I think would
correspond--so my preferences

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.416
and we'll talk about it--what
these preferences mean in a

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:52.306
second.
So here we go so â€¦

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:57.149
-1,( -1,0), (-1,0),
(-2, -2).

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:00.813
So here are the preferences for
these movies of Player 1 and

00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:03.980
Player 2, and you can see from
these preferences,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.580
from these payoffs,
that the best thing for Player

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.328
1 is for both players,
both people to meet and go to

00:09:11.328 --> 00:09:15.870
the Bourne Ultimatum;
this is the action movie.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.075
So it's not to be
sexist--assume this is the she

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:22.485
and this is the he,
so she would like to go and see

00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:26.100
Matt Damon beat people up and
coordinate on that,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.237
her favorite thing.
And she gets nothing if they

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.950
fail to coordinate and so on and
so forth.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.532
Her second choice is to manage
to coordinate at Matt Damon

00:09:38.532 --> 00:09:41.412
being a Yale spy,
and then she really doesn't

00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:44.218
want to go and see Snow
White, and the worst thing

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:45.767
of all,
actually this is for both

00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:48.281
players, the worst thing of all
is to coordinate with Snow

00:09:48.281 --> 00:09:50.795
White because then you've
got to talk about it afterwards

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:52.429
at Koffee [New Haven
café].

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:53.629
Same thing with the other
person.

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:57.734
Same thing exactly,
except that he would rather

00:09:57.734 --> 00:10:02.196
meet at the Good
Shepherd. Since he's a Yale

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:03.964
guy,
he probably thinks of himself

00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:05.710
as the Matt Damon character
though perhaps not,

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.362
and failing that,
he'd like to coordinate at the

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.613
Bourne Ultimatum.
But again, the disaster is to

00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:14.750
fail to coordinate and go to see
different movies.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.669
So these are the preferences.
What can we tell immediately,

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:19.779
if you're stuck in this
situation?

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:22.120
What can you tell immediately
about this game?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.907
What's an easy first step?
Let's get the guy in the red

00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:28.525
here.
Student: Snow

00:10:28.525 --> 00:10:30.169
White is dominated by both
players.

00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:32.835
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so for both players

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:35.090
Snow White is a dominated
strategy.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.531
So both players having taken
this class--I told you it would

00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:40.227
help you with your dating.
So both players will realize

00:10:40.227 --> 00:10:43.136
that they should at least not go
to Snow White,

00:10:43.136 --> 00:10:47.053
is that right?
Great animation but not perhaps

00:10:47.053 --> 00:10:50.230
a good date movie,
so it's gone.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.662
Everyone see that?
So that leaves us just with

00:10:53.662 --> 00:10:56.111
these two options,
the two Matt Damon movies,

00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:59.284
Bourne Ultimatum and
Good Shepherd. And here

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.758
are the remaining payoffs,
and let's see how we play this

00:11:02.758 --> 00:11:05.230
out.
So let's pick on some people.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:11.030
Ale you want to pick on
somebody?

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:17.362
I've got Kai here as well.
Okay, so you've picked on

00:11:17.362 --> 00:11:21.429
somebody there.
The person Ale picked on,

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:25.610
you want to stand up?
Okay, your name is?

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.019
Student: Nina.
Professor Ben Polak: Say

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.200
again loudly.
Student: Nina.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.850
Professor Ben Polak: Ana?
Shout it out so everyone hears.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.659
Student: Nina.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:39.559
Nina, okay Nina I'm sorry.
Nina and Kai get your guy to

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:41.910
stand up there.
And your name is?

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.712
Student: David.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:45.000
David so--do you know each
other?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.342
Student: No.
Professor Ben Polak: No

00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.529
you're--so you're about to go on
a date.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.220
So Nina's preferences are
Player 1's preferences here.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.209
So she--her best thing now is
to successfully meet David at

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:04.404
The Bourne Ultimatum and
David's preferences are Player

00:12:04.404 --> 00:12:07.097
2's preferences,
so his favorite thing is to

00:12:07.097 --> 00:12:09.440
successfully mette at The
Good Shepherd.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.985
Why don't you write down a
second on the corner of your

00:12:13.985 --> 00:12:19.120
notepad what it is you're going
to choose to do with my T.A.'s

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.590
watching so we can't cheat.
Both have it written down?

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.019
Should we have a good look at
them?

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.870
Should we just embarrass them a
bit?

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.110
We looked at them already I
guess.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.689
So Nina, shout out to the crowd
what it is you've--where it is

00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:34.511
you've chosen to go.
Student: Bourne

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:35.255
Ultimatum.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.745
Bourne Ultimatum;
and David where do you choose

00:12:36.745 --> 00:12:37.890
to go?
Student: I also put down

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.178
Bourne Ultimatum.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:47.799
They're going to coordinate;
that's very good.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:50.600
I don't know what this tells us
about David and Nina,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.970
but don't let them off the hook
quite yet.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.509
So now, that was good,
we managed to coordinate.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:59.950
I think we can all see that we
might not have done.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.159
Let's try some communication in
this game.

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:07.789
We said that coordination games
are helped by communication.

00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:09.349
So let's imagine we're playing
the game again,

00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:10.769
once again, you're going to the
movies,

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:13.227
once again the first one didn't
happen so you didn't--for some

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:15.603
reason it was cancelled that
night because someone had a bad

00:13:15.603 --> 00:13:18.069
cold or something.
You are about to go off on

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:21.227
Friday night to see these movies
and let's allow some

00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:25.576
communication ahead of time.
So David, you're about to go,

00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:29.830
you realize you've got this
coordination problem,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.145
so you phone Nina up and you
can say whatever you like,

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:36.527
so what would you say to Nina?
Student: Looks like you

00:13:36.527 --> 00:13:38.370
want to go to Bourne
Ultimatum.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.176
I'd rather go and--if you're
going to be stubborn I'd rather

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:48.063
go see Bourne Ultimatum
with you than not go on a date

00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:49.754
at all.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:53.041
here's another clue.
Stubborn is not a good first

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.897
date word, but okay.
So Nina what would you say in

00:13:56.897 --> 00:13:58.856
response to that?
Student: I'll go to

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:01.192
Bourne Ultimatum.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:14:01.192 --> 00:14:03.960
right, so write down what you're
going to do this time.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.407
Nina what did you do?
Student: Bourne

00:14:13.407 --> 00:14:14.262
Ultimatum.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:14.932
David?
Student: Bourne

00:14:14.932 --> 00:14:17.273
Ultimatum.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.612
they're still managing to
coordinate but you--okay,

00:14:20.612 --> 00:14:24.285
so thank you for this couple,
let's give them a round of

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:26.519
applause.
We may come back and pick on

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.120
you later on in the course,
but we'll leave it for now.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.552
So in this case,
the communication worked but am

00:14:32.552 --> 00:14:36.568
I right in thinking that the
communication isn't such an

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:40.950
instant solution as it was in
the game we saw last time?

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.020
This game's a little bit harder
to get communication to work.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.680
Why?
Is that right first of all?

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.350
So what's the problem here?
Why is this a slightly more

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.821
difficult game?
Let's keep the mikes handy a

00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:56.548
second.
Why is this a more difficult

00:14:56.548 --> 00:15:01.738
game to attain coordination in?
Student: Can I say the

00:15:01.738 --> 00:15:03.740
best response is the Nash
Equilibrium?

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.720
Professor Ben Polak:
Well no, hang on a second.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.380
Just slow down a second,
that's a good one.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.364
Let's start with that.
What are the Nash Equilibria in

00:15:10.364 --> 00:15:13.181
this game?
Somebody, let's just pick on

00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:16.100
somebody.
Just pick on anybody okay.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.659
Yeah, what are the Nash
Equilibria in this game?

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:20.630
Student: Both players
doing Bourne Ultimatum

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.220
and both players doing Good
Shepherd.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.245
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so in fact,

00:15:24.245 --> 00:15:26.269
if we checked the Nash
Equilibria in this game,

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:28.947
the Nash Equilibria,
and you can check that they are

00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:32.546
in fact best responses,
are both people doing The

00:15:32.546 --> 00:15:36.793
Bourne Ultimatum or both
people doing The Good

00:15:36.793 --> 00:15:39.128
Shepherd.
And the reason for that is if

00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:41.186
the other person's going to go
to Bourne Ultimatum I

00:15:41.186 --> 00:15:43.043
want to do that,
and if the other person's going

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:44.799
to go Good Shepherd I
want to do that.

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.340
So these are both Nash
Equilibria.;

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.230
That isn't so much the problem.
That was true last time as well.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.894
There were two well coordinated
Nash Equilibria although one was

00:15:52.894 --> 00:15:55.590
better than the other.
What's the tricky thing here?

00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:06.880
What's the extra trick here?
Is there a mike on this side?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.830
There was a hand up there, yeah.
Stand up.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.994
Great.
Student: Each player

00:16:15.994 --> 00:16:17.549
prefers a different Nash
Equilibrium.

00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:21.189
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so unlike the other game,

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.135
the two examples of
coordination games we saw so far

00:16:24.135 --> 00:16:26.620
were really pure coordination
problems.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.078
Is that right?
They were pure coordination

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:30.710
problems.
There was no conflict at all.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.247
In the case of the Investor
Game last week,

00:16:33.247 --> 00:16:36.509
every player preferred one
equilibrium to the other.

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:39.367
The game I just put up,
that's a trivial example,

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:42.879
it didn't really matter which
equilibrium we played here,

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:46.929
we just wanted to play an
equilibrium, is that right?

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:52.379
But here, there's a potential
source of conflict here.

00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:55.545
Both people would rather be at
an equilibrium than to be

00:16:55.545 --> 00:16:57.559
mal-coordinated or
uncoordinated,

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.051
but Player 1 wants to go to
Bourne Ultimatum and

00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.220
Player 2 wants to go to Good
Shepherd,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.630
and actually I thought Nina's
strategy there was pretty good.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.280
Nina's version of communication
was, "I'm going to Bourne

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.740
Ultimatum."
That basically fixed things.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.851
But you could imagine that
communication could break down

00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:18.251
here.
There could be a negotiation

00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:20.733
going on.
So think about--I don't want to

00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:24.032
push this too hard but think
about other games where people

00:17:24.032 --> 00:17:27.730
are communicating to fail--to
avoid a failure of coordination.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.670
There's a strike negotiation
going on as we speak.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.496
In fact, there was a critical
moment this morning up in

00:17:33.496 --> 00:17:36.742
Detroit between General Motors
and the united autoworkers and I

00:17:36.742 --> 00:17:40.250
don't want to say that strikes
are only about mis-coordination,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.091
but clearly,
everyone's better off if they

00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:46.140
come to some agreement rather
than strike.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.526
There's at least some agreement
that's going to be better for

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.752
everybody than a strike,
and yet, because they're

00:17:50.752 --> 00:17:53.237
conflicting interests there,
basically in that case

00:17:53.237 --> 00:17:56.119
conflicting interest about
health and pension payments,

00:17:56.119 --> 00:18:02.390
it could well be that you end
failing to coordinate.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.974
So this game has a name,
and actually somebody mentioned

00:18:04.974 --> 00:18:06.628
it last time.
Who was the person who

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:08.470
mentioned this last time?
Somebody mentioned this.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.690
What was this game called?
Shout it out!

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.500
Battle of the Sexes.
That's good.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:19.902
So this game's called The
Battle of the Sexes and we'll

00:18:19.902 --> 00:18:26.779
see it in various forms over the
course of the semester.

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.170
It's actually a very
interesting game.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.019
Games like it,
they are coordination games but

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:37.579
different people disagree about
where you'd like to coordinate.

00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:41.853
So much for talking about
coordination games and helping

00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:46.275
you with your dating strategy.
This being a Game Theory class,

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:49.898
there's at least one game we
have to discuss and we've come

00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:53.127
to it now.
So we're going to spend most of

00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:56.950
the rest of today talking about
Cournot Duopoly.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.380
Before I do that,
let me just check.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.990
How many of you have seen
Cournot Duopoly before?

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.579
Just raise your hands just for
me.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:05.779
All right, so maybe about half
of you.

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:07.386
So those of you who have,
don't worry,

00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:09.732
I mean this will be a bit
review, but we'll see it more

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.730
through the eyes of Game Theory
this time,

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.828
and for those of you who
haven't, don't worry we're going

00:19:14.828 --> 00:19:18.709
to go through it.
So this is a classic game,

00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:23.172
perhaps it's one of the most
famous games,

00:19:23.172 --> 00:19:28.069
and therefore worth studying in
the class.

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:34.829
Now, as a purely Game Theory
exercise, one reason for

00:19:34.829 --> 00:19:40.188
studying Cournot Duopoly,
is that so far we've discussed

00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:43.700
how to find Nash Equilibrium
when there are few players,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.746
each of whom has few
strategies, and we've discussed

00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:50.329
how to find Nash Equilibrium
where there are many players,

00:19:50.329 --> 00:19:53.230
each of whom has few
strategies, and this is a game

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.183
where there are few players,
maybe two, but they have many

00:19:57.183 --> 00:19:59.920
strategies.
They actually have a continuum

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.248
of strategies.
For those people who aren't

00:20:02.248 --> 00:20:05.189
familiar with this and are
worried about the economics of

00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:12.499
it in particular,
it's gone over in considerable

00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:20.220
detail in chapter 6 of the
textbook.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.094
So just to motivate this a
little bit, so there's two

00:20:23.094 --> 00:20:25.250
reasons why this game is
interesting.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.057
This is a game in which there
are two firms who are competing

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:31.850
in the same market,
and we'll give a bit more

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.508
detail in a second.
One reason this game is

00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:36.956
interesting from the point of
view of economics,

00:20:36.956 --> 00:20:40.134
is this game lies between the
two extreme cases that you learn

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:42.269
about in your Intro Economics
class.

00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:46.291
One extreme case is perfect
competition and the other

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.613
extreme case is monopoly.
So this is really the first

00:20:49.613 --> 00:20:52.036
attempt, way back in the
nineteenth century to study a

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:53.910
market that's somewhere in the
middle,

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.970
where it happens most markets
are--there are two firms.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.420
We're interested in two things
here.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.869
We're interested in what's
going to happen in these

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:05.289
markets.
And then from a welfare point

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:09.215
of view, from a policy point of
view, we're interested about

00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:12.875
whether this is good for
consumers or good for producers

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:16.359
or what.
How this relates to profits and

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.697
consumer surplus.
So with that in mind,

00:21:19.697 --> 00:21:25.057
let's just set the game up.
So the players in this game are

00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:30.648
two firms and the strategies in
this game for the firms--and

00:21:30.648 --> 00:21:36.334
this is going to turn out to be
important--the strategies are

00:21:36.334 --> 00:21:42.210
the quantities that they produce
of an identical product.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:51.798
So they are the quantities they
produce, each of them produces,

00:21:51.798 --> 00:21:57.680
of an identical product.
So as far as the consumers are

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.089
concerned, these two products
are perfect substitutes.

00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:03.753
You could think of these as two
companies producing bottled

00:22:03.753 --> 00:22:06.463
water--and now we're going to
get hundreds of letters saying

00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:08.299
not all bottled waters are the
same,

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:10.890
especially from Italians and
the French, but never mind.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.410
Let's just pretend that they
are.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.114
So just to emphasize that the
strategies are quantities,

00:22:17.114 --> 00:22:21.289
rather than using S let me use
q today to be the strategies.

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:28.583
So qi and q-i or q_1
and q_2 will be the

00:22:28.583 --> 00:22:31.339
strategies.
We need to give a little bit

00:22:31.339 --> 00:22:33.720
more structure on the payoff
before I get to the payoffs.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.224
So in particular,
I need to tell you what is the

00:22:37.224 --> 00:22:42.046
cost of production.
And the cost of production in

00:22:42.046 --> 00:22:46.089
this game is simply going to be
cq.

00:22:46.089 --> 00:22:49.289
So if I produce one unit it
costs me c;

00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:52.210
if I produce two units it costs
me 2c;

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:57.457
if I produce 100 units,
it'll cost me 100c and if I

00:22:57.457 --> 00:23:01.759
produce .735 units that costs me
.735c.

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.537
So for those people who took
Intro Economics,

00:23:05.537 --> 00:23:09.916
which is most of you,
this is a game--this a setting

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:13.780
in which we have constant
marginal costs.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:21.379
The constant marginal cost is c.
I'll need to tell you about how

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:24.859
prices are determined in this
market.

00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:30.204
So prices are determined as
follows: prices depend on some

00:23:30.204 --> 00:23:34.329
parameters I'm just going to
call a and b,

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:37.388
and let me write the equation
and then we'll see what it looks

00:23:37.388 --> 00:23:39.754
like.
So basically the idea is that

00:23:39.754 --> 00:23:43.852
the more these firms produce,
so the more the total quantity

00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:46.769
produced q_1 +
q_2,

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:51.569
the lower is the price in the
marketplace for this product.

00:23:51.569 --> 00:23:53.369
Let's just draw a picture of
that;

00:23:53.369 --> 00:23:57.329
we'll come back to this in a
minute.

00:23:57.329 --> 00:24:01.920
Let's draw a picture which we
can keep for later.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.940
Actually, let's save myself
some time and bring this down.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:14.071
So this equation I've just
written, if you can imagine

00:24:14.071 --> 00:24:19.005
q_1 + q_2,
total quantity on the

00:24:19.005 --> 00:24:23.024
horizontal axis,
and you could imagine price on

00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:28.628
the vertical axis,
and basically what we're saying

00:24:28.628 --> 00:24:34.950
is that prices depend on total
quantities as follows:

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.569
where the slope of this line is
-b.

00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:43.810
Now, for those of you who took
Economics 115 or equivalent,

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.319
what is the name of this line
I've just drawn?

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:50.080
That was way fewer responses
than I wanted.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.994
Let's try again;
what's the name of this

00:24:51.994 --> 00:24:54.830
downward sloping (hint-hint)
line that I've just drawn?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.580
It's a demand curve.
Thank you;

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.849
it's a demand curve.
That was the demand.

00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:07.314
It tells me--the other way
around--to look at how prices

00:25:07.314 --> 00:25:11.292
correspond to quantities,
it tells me the quantity

00:25:11.292 --> 00:25:16.262
demanded at any given price.
We'll come back to that in a

00:25:16.262 --> 00:25:19.326
second.
Meanwhile, let's just finish up

00:25:19.326 --> 00:25:22.559
what we're doing here and put in
payoffs.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:28.878
So payoffs for these firms are
going to depend on profits,

00:25:28.878 --> 00:25:35.887
the payoffs.
The firms' aim to maximize

00:25:35.887 --> 00:25:49.322
profit and profit is going to be
given by P times q minus--sorry,

00:25:49.322 --> 00:25:56.720
let's do this for Firm 1.
Let's be careful here;

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.109
let's do this for Firm 1 and
we'll do Firm 2 in a second.

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:02.606
So the payoff for Firm 1,
as it depends on the quantity

00:26:02.606 --> 00:26:06.038
that she produces and the
quantity that the other firm

00:26:06.038 --> 00:26:11.127
produces,
is going to be prices times the

00:26:11.127 --> 00:26:19.212
quantity that Firm 1 produces
minus costs times the quantity

00:26:19.212 --> 00:26:27.794
that she produces.
So this is--this term here is

00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:36.450
revenues and this term here is
total costs.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.601
Revenues minus costs makes
profits, and again,

00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:41.279
for those of you who are less
familiar with economics,

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:45.470
I'm hoping this is not really
too hard but you can read up on

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.134
it.
What I'm going to do here is

00:26:49.134 --> 00:26:53.750
I'm going to substitute in for
prices.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:59.822
So I've got this expression for
prices here, here it is,

00:26:59.822 --> 00:27:04.460
and I want to plug it into that
P there.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:11.200
And I'm going to rewrite it now
with that P expanded out.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:19.375
So I'm going to get--I'm going
to multiply it out at the same

00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:25.098
time, so I'm going to have
aq_1 -

00:27:25.098 --> 00:27:32.048
bq_1²
- bq_1q_2 -

00:27:32.048 --> 00:27:36.267
cq_1.
All I'm doing here,

00:27:36.267 --> 00:27:40.125
nothing particularly exciting,
I'm simply plugging this

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:44.412
expression in for P and then I
multiplied the whole thing out

00:27:44.412 --> 00:27:47.269
because it was all multiplied by
q.

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:50.408
I should warn you again that
I'm very likely to make mistakes

00:27:50.408 --> 00:27:53.599
when I'm doing this kind of
thing, so please catch me I do.

00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:58.245
So here I have a new expression
for Firm 1's profit and I could

00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:02.141
do the same for Firm 2,
but I'm not going too because

00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:08.640
it's--I'm getting bored.
So this is just Firm 1's profit.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.944
Now, with this in hand,
what I want to do is,

00:28:10.944 --> 00:28:13.250
and in Firm 2 I have a similar
expression,

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:18.652
what I want to do is,
I want to figure out the Nash

00:28:18.652 --> 00:28:24.209
Equilibrium of this game.
Now, I will need the other

00:28:24.209 --> 00:28:27.651
board;
I want to figure out the Nash

00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:31.440
Equilibrium on this game.
Both firms are producing

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.792
quantities;
both firms are trying to

00:28:33.792 --> 00:28:37.088
maximize profit,
and I want to find out the Nash

00:28:37.088 --> 00:28:40.119
Equilibrium.
How do I go about that exercise?

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:42.857
What's the--what do I need to
do find each firm's Nash

00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:45.754
Equilibrium?
How do we always find Nash

00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:48.850
Equilibrium when we're not
guessing?

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.250
What do we do?
Anybody?

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.384
Somebody way over there who's
going to be way off camera but

00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:55.759
we can actually get a mike in
there.

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:58.849
Can we get a--he's way in the
corner there.

00:28:58.849 --> 00:29:03.387
Come this way,
a little closer to the aisle,

00:29:03.387 --> 00:29:06.173
there you go.
Student: Well,

00:29:06.173 --> 00:29:09.154
we would just delete the--we
would iteratively delete

00:29:09.154 --> 00:29:11.175
dominated strategies.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:29:11.175 --> 00:29:12.410
Okay, we could do that.
We could do that;

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.709
we could try iteratively
deleting dominated strategies

00:29:15.709 --> 00:29:17.950
and see if that process
converged.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.025
I had something else in mind
here, something else more

00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:21.470
straightforward.
What else?

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.582
The guy in red.
Student: Identify the

00:29:25.582 --> 00:29:27.774
best responses of each player as
a function of the others and

00:29:27.774 --> 00:29:29.650
find out where they intersect.
Professor Ben Polak: Say

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.795
that loud--more--that was
correct, say it more loudly,

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:32.140
shout.
Student: Identify the

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.604
best responses of each player as
a function of the others and

00:29:34.604 --> 00:29:36.343
find out where they intersect.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:29:36.343 --> 00:29:38.287
Okay good.
So what we're going to do is

00:29:38.287 --> 00:29:42.181
we're going to figure out Player
1's best response quantity to

00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:44.480
each possible choice of Player
2,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.660
and then we're going to flip it
around and figure out Player 2's

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.740
best response quantity to each
possible choice of Player 1,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.284
and then we're going to see
where they--where those

00:29:53.284 --> 00:29:56.622
coincide, where they cross.
So, just like we've done

00:29:56.622 --> 00:30:00.815
several times before.
So what I need to do then is I

00:30:00.815 --> 00:30:05.288
need to figure out what is
Player 1's best response for

00:30:05.288 --> 00:30:09.430
each possible choice
q_2 of Player 2.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.775
So how do I do that?
I want to find the best

00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:18.039
response.
How do I do that?

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:22.450
Everyone is looking like this
is--I bet you all know really.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.680
Anybody?
Cold call somebody?

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:36.310
Athletic day for you.
Somebody way at the back there;

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:40.203
stand up and shout.
Student: Find the best

00:30:40.203 --> 00:30:42.045
response function by
differentiating this and

00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:44.180
maximizing the function for
every q_2,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.725
so we could just-- Professor
Ben Polak: Good,

00:30:45.725 --> 00:30:47.150
so what we're going to do
is--all right good,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.554
we're going to--we're trying to
maximize--the best response is

00:30:51.554 --> 00:30:55.044
going to maximize these profits.
So, in particular,

00:30:55.044 --> 00:30:58.549
what we're going to do to find
out what quantity q_1

00:30:58.549 --> 00:31:01.940
maximizes this profits for each
choice of q_2.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.924
We're going to differentiate
this with respect to

00:31:04.924 --> 00:31:08.950
q_1 and then what?
And then set it equal to 0.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.390
So again, let me just take a
look out there.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.728
How many of you remember this?
We did this once before in this

00:31:13.728 --> 00:31:16.056
class.
How many of you remember this

00:31:16.056 --> 00:31:20.220
from when you were--high school
calculus days or from 112?

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.826
Quite a number of you actually.
Okay, good, so what we're going

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:28.396
to do is we're going to
differentiate this thing to find

00:31:28.396 --> 00:31:32.562
a first order condition.
We're going to differentiate

00:31:32.562 --> 00:31:36.476
with respect to q_1,
the thing we're trying--our

00:31:36.476 --> 00:31:39.464
control variable,
the thing we're trying to

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:43.210
maximize the thing with respect
to and set it equal to 0.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.383
So what are we going to get?
So this term here

00:31:46.383 --> 00:31:53.410
aq_1 is going to
become an a and this term here

00:31:53.410 --> 00:32:00.815
-bq² is going to become a
2bq_1 and this term

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:04.946
here,
-b q_1q_2

00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:08.518
is going to become a
-bq_2,

00:32:08.518 --> 00:32:12.883
and the last term
-cq_1 is going to

00:32:12.883 --> 00:32:15.349
become a -c.
Everyone happy with that?

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:19.623
What I did was I differentiated
this fairly simple function with

00:32:19.623 --> 00:32:23.829
respect to q_1 and
since I want to find a maximum,

00:32:23.829 --> 00:32:27.847
what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set this thing equal to

00:32:27.847 --> 00:32:28.880
0.
At my maximum,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.869
I'll put a hat over it to
indicate this is the argmax;

00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:35.289
at my maximum I'm going to set
this thing equal to 0.

00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:39.083
Now, since we're being nerdy in
this class, despite our attempts

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:40.950
to go dating,
we're being nerdy,

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:43.539
let's actually be a little bit
careful.

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:45.672
This was a first order
condition or a first order

00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:47.802
necessary condition.
I actually need to check the

00:32:47.802 --> 00:32:51.272
second order condition.
So how do I check the second

00:32:51.272 --> 00:32:54.119
order condition?
I differentiate again, right?

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:56.571
I differentiate a second time
and check the sign,

00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:59.687
so the second order condition,
I differentiate this expression

00:32:59.687 --> 00:33:01.730
again with respect to
q_1.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.324
The only place q_1
appears here is here,

00:33:05.324 --> 00:33:09.579
so when I differentiate again
I'm going to get -2b and sure

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:13.027
enough that's negative,
which is what I wanted to know,

00:33:13.027 --> 00:33:15.299
just to check that when I'm
finding this thing,

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:18.529
I'm finding a maximum and not a
minimum.

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:24.112
Good, so this is our key
expression and I'm going to use

00:33:24.112 --> 00:33:27.296
this expression;
I'm going to solve it for

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:30.854
q_1.
So the best response for Player

00:33:30.854 --> 00:33:35.990
1, as a function of what Player
2 chooses, q_2,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.504
is just equal to the
q_1 hat in this

00:33:38.504 --> 00:33:41.130
expression and if I solve that
out carefully,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.680
I will no doubt make a mistake,
but let's try it.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:58.859
I got to have a - c over 2b -
q_2 over 2.

00:33:58.859 --> 00:34:00.940
So try that at home,
I think I did that right.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:08.813
So I took this to the other
side and I divided through by 2b

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:13.466
and the b here cancels.
Everyone just stare at that a

00:34:13.466 --> 00:34:15.010
second, make sure I got it
right.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.190
I'm very capable of getting
these things wrong.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:25.579
Good, so what I have here is an
equation that tells me Player

00:34:25.579 --> 00:34:31.650
1's best response for each
possible choice of Player 2.

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.753
I could do the same thing for
Player 2 to find Player 2's best

00:34:35.753 --> 00:34:39.050
response for every possible
choice of Player 1.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.199
On the other hand,
we know it's--the math is going

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.320
to be the same,
so let's cheat.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.680
I know that Player 2's best
response for every possible

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.555
choice of Player 1,
which if we had done it would

00:34:52.555 --> 00:34:57.400
be q_2 hat is going to
a - c over 2b--q_1

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.769
over 2,
right?

00:34:58.769 --> 00:35:04.889
I'm just flipping around the
2's and the 1's.

00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:08.250
So at this point I've found
Player 1's best response as a

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.405
function of q_2.
I've found Player 2's best

00:35:11.405 --> 00:35:13.618
response as a function of
q_1,

00:35:13.618 --> 00:35:15.961
and the way I did it,
just remember,

00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:20.237
the way I did it was I applied
a little bit of 112 and/or high

00:35:20.237 --> 00:35:24.659
school calculus,
so that's your single variable

00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:27.152
calculus.
Now, we could just solve at

00:35:27.152 --> 00:35:33.250
this point but let's not.
Let's draw these.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:37.767
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go back to my picture

00:35:37.767 --> 00:35:43.411
and draw these functions.
I'll just remind us of what

00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:49.065
these functions are;
it's a - c over 2b -

00:35:49.065 --> 00:35:56.320
q_2 over 2 and
accordingly for Player 2.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.559
That's the thing;
it was hidden by the board.

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:01.865
What I want to do is I want to
draw a picture,

00:36:01.865 --> 00:36:04.530
a little bit like we did for
the partnership game.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.670
So in the partnership game we
put efforts on these axis and

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.269
now I'm going to put quantities
on these axis.

00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:14.367
So this is going to be the
choice of Player 1,

00:36:14.367 --> 00:36:18.829
and this is going to be the
choice of Player 2,

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:20.988
and what I want to do is I want
to figure out what this looks

00:36:20.988 --> 00:36:23.971
like.
For each q_2 that you

00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.817
give me or that Player 2
chooses, I want to find out and

00:36:28.817 --> 00:36:32.429
draw what is Player 1's best
response.

00:36:32.429 --> 00:36:35.740
Everyone happy with what I'm
doing here?

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.401
So let's start somewhere;
what we're going to do is we'll

00:36:39.401 --> 00:36:43.040
refer back to this other
picture, which is why I left it

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.548
here.
So, in particular,

00:36:45.548 --> 00:36:51.701
what would be Player 1's best
response if Player 2 didn't

00:36:51.701 --> 00:36:54.360
produce at all?
How do we find that?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.068
Without worrying about the
economics of it a second,

00:36:57.068 --> 00:36:59.670
how would we find that just as
a math exercise?

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:05.360
So suppose Player 2 doesn't
produce at all.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.730
What is Player 1's best
response?

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:14.930
Someone read it off for me.
Why don't we cold call somebody

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:20.050
out, you can-- Student: a
- c over 2b.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.990
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so shout that out.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.738
Student: a - c over 2b.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:37:25.738 --> 00:37:29.637
Good, so if I plug q_2
= 0 into here,

00:37:29.637 --> 00:37:34.130
this term disappears and I just
get a - c over 2b.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.291
What's that telling me?
Let me put the 45º

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:42.096
line in here.
What's that telling me is that

00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:49.561
if Player 2 chooses not to
produce then Player 1's best

00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:55.486
response is a - c over 2b.
Now, I claim that that

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:59.929
quantity, a - c over 2b actually
has another name.

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:03.210
What's the name of that
quantity?

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.360
What's the name of the quantity
a - c over 2b?

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.482
Once we escape the algebra just
think about it in terms of

00:38:10.482 --> 00:38:12.389
economics.
Let's think about it a bit,

00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:13.889
let's go back to the previous
picture.

00:38:13.889 --> 00:38:20.576
If Player 2 is producing
nothing, then what is Player 1

00:38:20.576 --> 00:38:23.110
effectively?
He's a monopoly;

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.313
so she's a monopolist,
so we know how to figure out

00:38:26.313 --> 00:38:29.901
monopoly quantities from what we
did in 115 or equivalent

00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:31.699
courses.
Let me finish the picture here;

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:36.342
here's my demand curve,
here's my constant marginal

00:38:36.342 --> 00:38:41.821
cost at c, and I want to use
this picture on the left now to

00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:46.000
figure out what the monopoly
quantity is.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.829
Can anyone tell me--let's cold
call somebody again.

00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:53.730
Raise your hand if you took
115,110 or 150.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.329
No, no, I know more of you took
it than that.

00:38:55.329 --> 00:38:58.409
It's a pre-req for the class,
right?

00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:01.730
Raise your hands if you didn't
take any of those things.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.173
Ale, keep your hands up.
Cold call somebody who hasn't

00:39:06.173 --> 00:39:14.010
got their hand up.
Anybody, go ahead.

00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:21.241
Do you want to tell me what
the--where's the monopoly

00:39:21.241 --> 00:39:26.824
quantity on this picture?
The woman--where you are--the

00:39:26.824 --> 00:39:29.254
woman here.
Student: Oh no I really

00:39:29.254 --> 00:39:30.659
don't remember.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:33.329
Don't remember.
Student: I'm sorry.

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:38.789
Professor Ben Polak: Who
else doesn't remember?

00:39:38.789 --> 00:39:42.796
Somebody must--don't remember
is a good reply if you're

00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:47.099
auditioning to be the Attorney
General, but it's not such a

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:50.621
good reply--anybody?
Somebody help me out here,

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:53.769
where's the monopoly quantity
on this picture?

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:55.550
It's a good review exercise,
yeah.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.056
Student: It's where the
marginal revenue is equal to the

00:39:57.056 --> 00:39:58.041
marginal costs.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:58.041 --> 00:39:59.099
It's where marginal revenue
equals marginal cost.

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:01.159
I should have picked on some of
the SOM people by the way.

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:03.791
It's where marginal revenue
equals marginal cost,

00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:05.934
right?
The reason I should pick on the

00:40:05.934 --> 00:40:09.125
SOM people, is their ambition in
life is to run a monopoly,

00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:10.726
right.
Trouble is I haven't drawn the

00:40:10.726 --> 00:40:13.096
marginal revenue curve yet.
Right, you can't actually see

00:40:13.096 --> 00:40:15.503
the marginal revenue here.
What does the marginal revenue

00:40:15.503 --> 00:40:17.538
look like in this picture?
Why don't we go to the same

00:40:17.538 --> 00:40:19.263
guy, the guy in brown.
Where's the marginal

00:40:19.263 --> 00:40:21.604
revenue--what's the marginal
revenue look like in this

00:40:21.604 --> 00:40:23.845
picture on the left?
Student: It's half the

00:40:23.845 --> 00:40:25.352
slope of the price.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:26.774
Yeah, or it's--I guess it's
twice the slope but that's fair

00:40:26.774 --> 00:40:28.320
enough.
I know what you mean.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.966
So the marginal revenue here,
let's put it in a different

00:40:33.966 --> 00:40:39.613
color, the marginal revenue
looks something like this and

00:40:39.613 --> 00:40:45.260
as--I don't know what your name
is--as the guy said,

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:53.349
the monopoly quantity is when
marginal revenue equals marginal

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:57.483
costs.
As we know, this line here has

00:40:57.483 --> 00:41:03.219
twice the slope of the original
line of the demand curve,

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:07.010
so the slope of this thing is
-2b.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.636
Now, I'm going to claim that
this monopoly quantity I claimed

00:41:10.636 --> 00:41:13.961
before is going to--our
intuition says if the other firm

00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:16.378
isn't producing,
my best response must be to

00:41:16.378 --> 00:41:19.019
produce monopoly quantity which
I can see on this picture,

00:41:19.019 --> 00:41:21.199
and I also claim that the math
is telling me,

00:41:21.199 --> 00:41:23.280
just a kind of nerdy math is
telling me,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.114
that that quantity is a - c
over 2b and I claim that they're

00:41:27.114 --> 00:41:29.922
the same thing.
How can I see they're the same

00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:32.764
thing?
Well look, here I have a line

00:41:32.764 --> 00:41:35.780
of slope -2.
How far down does it have to go?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.620
It has to a - c down.
This pink line has to drop off

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.373
from a all the way to c.
How far along do I have to go

00:41:44.373 --> 00:41:47.510
drop off a - c when I have slope
-2b?

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:53.349
Answer a - c over 2b.
Not even calculus - all you

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:59.784
need is high school.
So this monopoly quantity is

00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:04.393
indeed a - c over 2b.
I'm going to ask again,

00:42:04.393 --> 00:42:06.579
is some of this being--coming
out of the fog?

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:08.673
I mean, you may not understand
it with algebra before but some

00:42:08.673 --> 00:42:10.389
of these sorts of pictures have
you seen before?

00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:14.512
It's good review exercise for
some of you who are--who have

00:42:14.512 --> 00:42:18.349
taken 115 or are about to take
150 or are there now.

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:22.442
So we found precisely one point
on this best response picture,

00:42:22.442 --> 00:42:26.198
and there's a lot of points to
find, and it's 20 past 12,

00:42:26.198 --> 00:42:30.064
so we better get going.
So let's try and find another

00:42:30.064 --> 00:42:31.949
point.
Let's ask a different question.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:38.898
How much quantity would Firm 2
have to produce in order to

00:42:38.898 --> 00:42:43.530
induce Firm 1 not to produce at
all?

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:52.064
Again, how much quantity would
Firm 2 have to produce in order

00:42:52.064 --> 00:42:58.080
to induce Firm 1's best response
to be 0?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.639
Help me out--it's Katie.
Is that right?

00:43:00.639 --> 00:43:03.470
The woman in green,
let's get a mike to Katie.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:08.800
Or, there's a mike close by.
Student: a - c over 2b.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.723
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so that's just solving

00:43:10.723 --> 00:43:15.207
out the algebra,
so we're saying what's--what q

00:43:15.207 --> 00:43:21.719
solves, a - c over 2b -
q_2 over 2 = 0.

00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:29.096
What q_2 makes this
equal to 0 and Katie's answer is

00:43:29.096 --> 00:43:36.472
solving out the algebra here is
that q_2 that solves

00:43:36.472 --> 00:43:41.340
this must be a - c over b.
That's right;

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.610
where can I see that one on the
picture though?

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.280
Let's go back to the economics.
So I'm claiming that there's

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.747
some quantity up here.
I claim this quantity is a - c

00:43:51.747 --> 00:43:57.052
over b such that if Firm 2
produces that much quantity,

00:43:57.052 --> 00:44:00.590
Firm 1 will just produce
nothing.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.360
But that's just kind of algebra
and math.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.320
Where can I see it on this
picture?

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.488
What quantity,
if produced by Firm 2,

00:44:09.488 --> 00:44:13.890
would cause Firm 1 to shut down
on this picture?

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:22.307
Let's get a mike in here.
Student: That's where

00:44:22.307 --> 00:44:25.960
the marginal cost and the demand
thing, demand lines intersect.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.871
Professor Ben Polak: So
it's here right,

00:44:27.871 --> 00:44:32.021
it's here.
It's where marginal--it's where

00:44:32.021 --> 00:44:38.030
the marginal cost and the demand
curve intersects.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.789
What's the intuition?
Let's work it out.

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:48.710
Suppose Firm 2 has produced all
of this quantity up to here.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.219
So Firm 2 is already producing
all of this quantity.

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:57.433
So already, just from Firm 2's
production the price has been

00:44:57.433 --> 00:45:01.119
driven all the way down to
costs.

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:04.758
So if I--I'm Firm 1--if I
produce any more quantity,

00:45:04.758 --> 00:45:07.469
what's going to happen to the
price?

00:45:07.469 --> 00:45:09.802
I produce any quantity at all
in addition to what's out there

00:45:09.802 --> 00:45:11.630
already, what's going to happen
to the price?

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:16.130
It's going to be pushed below
costs.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:20.005
So I'll be producing this
stuff, this water at cost c and

00:45:20.005 --> 00:45:23.051
only getting p,
which is not only less than c

00:45:23.051 --> 00:45:26.364
in return.
So I'll be losing money on any

00:45:26.364 --> 00:45:28.860
product that I produce.
Does everyone see that?

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.980
Let me say it again.
So Firm 2--if Firm 2 produces

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:37.152
all the way up to here then any
product produced by Firm 1 is

00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:41.324
going to push prices even lower.
In particular,

00:45:41.324 --> 00:45:46.023
they'll be lower here than
costs and so you'll make losses

00:45:46.023 --> 00:45:49.344
on that product.
What's the name--going back to

00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:52.269
Economics 115--what's the name
for this quantity?

00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:58.493
The quantity where demand and
marginal costs equal--that's the

00:45:58.493 --> 00:46:02.385
competitive quantity.
So this is the perfect

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:05.515
competition quantity.
In a perfectly competitive

00:46:05.515 --> 00:46:08.929
market that's exactly where
prices are going to end up.

00:46:08.929 --> 00:46:11.300
This is not a perfectly
competitive market,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.839
but if it were,
that's where price is going to

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:16.974
end up.
So we have the monopoly

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:21.456
quantity here,
and we have the competitive

00:46:21.456 --> 00:46:27.906
here, and in between what does
this best response curve look

00:46:27.906 --> 00:46:30.050
like?
Somebody?

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:37.440
It's a straight line, thank you.
So in between--this is just a

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.933
straight line.
So here is the best response of

00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:49.289
Firm 1 to each possible choice
of Firm 2.

00:46:49.289 --> 00:46:51.202
Everyone's looking really like
this was hard,

00:46:51.202 --> 00:46:54.308
but it can't be that hard.
Most of you have seen this

00:46:54.308 --> 00:46:56.029
before.
If you haven't seen it before

00:46:56.029 --> 00:46:57.664
don't panic.
All I did was,

00:46:57.664 --> 00:47:02.081
I did a little bit of calculus,
a little bit of algebra,

00:47:02.081 --> 00:47:06.657
and then I drew the thing.
Okay, so this is Firm 1's best

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.730
response as a function of
q_2.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:14.849
What is Firm 2's best response
as a function of q_1?

00:47:14.849 --> 00:47:17.758
Let's just--we'll get there,
just to remind you,

00:47:17.758 --> 00:47:21.409
the way we read this is you
give me a quantity of Firm 2,

00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:25.890
I find Firm 1's best response
by going across to the pink line

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.646
and dropping down.
So if Firm 2 produces this

00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:31.170
amount then Firm 1's best
response is this amount.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:35.686
If Firm 2 produces this amount
then Firm 1's best response is

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.802
this amount.
Now conversely,

00:47:37.802 --> 00:47:41.556
how do we find Firm 2's best
response as a function of

00:47:41.556 --> 00:47:46.800
q_1?
What does that look like?

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.310
Those two guys in front of you.
Student: It's

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.719
Professor Ben Polak:
Shout it out.

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:56.404
Student: It's
symmetrical across the 45º

00:47:56.404 --> 00:47:58.197
axis.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:47:58.197 --> 00:48:00.190
right, it's reflected across the
45º line.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.100
So let's reflect these two
points.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.094
This will be here;
this will be--I've got to be a

00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:13.911
bit more careful.
Missed by a mile,

00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:20.888
let me try again.
I missed by a mile,

00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:27.840
which is a problem in drawing
my lines, but never mind.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:35.049
So this will be the monopoly
quantity for Firm 2 and this is

00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:39.570
the competitive quantity of Firm
1.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.364
So if I had drawn that better
it would look as if this was

00:48:43.364 --> 00:48:46.760
half of this distance,
but I didn't draw it well.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.099
Try and draw it better in your
notes.

00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:56.488
So this is a - c over b and
this is a - c over 2b so this

00:48:56.488 --> 00:49:00.719
distance and this distance are
meant to be the same.

00:49:00.719 --> 00:49:10.469
The way I've drawn it they're
not the same at all.

00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:15.357
The way we read this green
graph is you give me a choice of

00:49:15.357 --> 00:49:20.413
Firm 1, q_1.
I go up to the green line and

00:49:20.413 --> 00:49:26.480
go across and this tells me the
best response for Firm 2.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.814
So at this point,
how many of you have seen this

00:49:29.814 --> 00:49:33.317
picture before?
A good many of you have seen it

00:49:33.317 --> 00:49:36.128
before.
So I think we can really cold

00:49:36.128 --> 00:49:40.738
call somebody for this one.
So somebody tell me--pick

00:49:40.738 --> 00:49:45.180
somebody to cold--why don't you
call a person,

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.050
anybody that goes by.
There we go, okay.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.053
So here's the tough question.
What's the Nash Equilibrium on

00:49:52.053 --> 00:49:53.586
this picture?
Student: Where the green

00:49:53.586 --> 00:49:55.723
and the pink line intersect.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:49:55.723 --> 00:49:58.010
right, where the green and the
pink line intersect.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:01.999
So this must be the Nash
Equilibrium, that wasn't hard,

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:05.869
right?
Okay now--so why--let's go back

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.803
again.
Why is this the Nash

00:50:07.803 --> 00:50:09.465
Equilibrium?
Because at this point,

00:50:09.465 --> 00:50:11.557
as in the partnership game,
which there was a similar

00:50:11.557 --> 00:50:13.407
thing,
as in the partnership game

00:50:13.407 --> 00:50:16.498
where the best responses
intersect is where Player 1 is

00:50:16.498 --> 00:50:18.730
playing a best response to
Player 2,

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.429
and Player 2 is playing a best
response to Player 1.

00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:26.119
So this is the Nash Equilibrium
in this Cournot game.

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:31.629
Let's do a little bit of
algebra just to make sure we can

00:50:31.629 --> 00:50:37.511
find this thing.
So what we're going to do is

00:50:37.511 --> 00:50:46.469
set these two things equal to
each other, put in stars here.

00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:51.896
So at the Nash Equilibrium
quantities I'm going to have

00:50:51.896 --> 00:50:58.226
q_1* is equal to a - c
over 2bq* and q_2* is

00:50:58.226 --> 00:51:04.255
equal to a - c 2bq_1*
over 2 and now we're going to

00:51:04.255 --> 00:51:09.682
solve this out by setting
q_1 = q_2

00:51:09.682 --> 00:51:15.108
since I know the game is
symmetric and they were on the

00:51:15.108 --> 00:51:19.540
45º line.
So what I have to do here to do

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.930
this algebraically is to solve
out these equations.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:27.311
So let's try and do that.
So putting q_1 in

00:51:27.311 --> 00:51:30.420
here--if I substitute
q_1 in here,

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:36.769
what will that give me?
It'll give me q_1* is

00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:43.690
equal to a - c over 2b -
q_1* over 2.

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:52.044
Let's multiply both sides by 2,
I'll get 2q_1* is

00:51:52.044 --> 00:51:57.950
equal to a - c over b -
q_1*.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:02.555
Take that to the other side.
I have 3 q_1* is

00:52:02.555 --> 00:52:10.723
equal to a - c over b;
and finally divide by 3

00:52:10.723 --> 00:52:19.750
q_1* is equal to a - c
over 3b.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:25.210
So that crossing point actually
occurs at a - c over 3b.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:29.115
I'm going to look desperately
at my T.A.'s to make sure I

00:52:29.115 --> 00:52:33.878
didn't screw that up.
So this is something that's

00:52:33.878 --> 00:52:38.136
called the Cournot quantity.
Now, this game,

00:52:38.136 --> 00:52:41.080
this game of imperfect
competition between two firms

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.414
competing in quantities,
was thought up and studied by a

00:52:45.414 --> 00:52:50.784
French economist called Cournot
almost a hundred years before

00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:54.079
Nash.
So a hundred years really

00:52:54.079 --> 00:53:00.167
before the invention of Game
Theory, someone had figured out

00:53:00.167 --> 00:53:05.110
this answer for this game.
Okay, so what do we know so far?

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:16.949
I'll leave the algebra there,
transfer it up here,

00:53:16.949 --> 00:53:29.030
q_1* = q_2*
= a - c over 3b.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.926
So, so far, we've been working
pretty hard and we haven't,

00:53:31.926 --> 00:53:34.568
I guess, learned a lot,
we've just kind of solved the

00:53:34.568 --> 00:53:36.406
thing out.
Now, we get to draw some

00:53:36.406 --> 00:53:38.941
lessons out of this thing,
so everybody who's feeling a

00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:41.663
little bit shell shocked from
having been doing algebra and

00:53:41.663 --> 00:53:44.386
calculus and drawing pictures
and feeling like they've been

00:53:44.386 --> 00:53:46.968
cheated into taking a class that
looks far too much like

00:53:46.968 --> 00:53:51.073
economics,
calm down we're going to

00:53:51.073 --> 00:53:55.687
actually talk right now.
So, one thing to remark about

00:53:55.687 --> 00:53:57.916
this game, one thing that we've
learned immediately,

00:53:57.916 --> 00:54:00.320
is that this game is different
in a significant way.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.860
It's different from the
partnership game.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.556
I mean, obviously it's
different because it's about

00:54:04.556 --> 00:54:06.287
something different,
but I mean in terms of the Game

00:54:06.287 --> 00:54:08.297
Theory it's different.
It's different from the

00:54:08.297 --> 00:54:10.258
partnership game,
it's different from the

00:54:10.258 --> 00:54:12.519
investment game.
What is it that's different

00:54:12.519 --> 00:54:15.572
about this game from the--what's
the obvious thing just looking

00:54:15.572 --> 00:54:18.477
at this picture that makes it
different from the partnership

00:54:18.477 --> 00:54:21.586
game?
In the partnership game the

00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:26.738
best response lines sloped up.
The more I did of my strategy,

00:54:26.738 --> 00:54:30.320
the more the other player did
as a best response.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.605
In the investment game,
the more likely I was to

00:54:33.605 --> 00:54:37.869
invest, the more likely you--the
more you wanted to invest.

00:54:37.869 --> 00:54:40.849
But in this game we have the
exact opposites.

00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:47.597
The more Player 1 produces,
the less Player 2 wants to

00:54:47.597 --> 00:54:54.726
produce and the more Player 2
produces, the less Player 1

00:54:54.726 --> 00:55:01.005
wants to produce.
So this game is a game,

00:55:01.005 --> 00:55:10.410
not of strategic complements,
but of strategic substitutes.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:15.255
I want to be careful here.
It's not that these goods are

00:55:15.255 --> 00:55:17.651
substitutes.
I mean, clearly that's also the

00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:19.704
case, right?
If both these firms are

00:55:19.704 --> 00:55:23.730
producing bottled water and it's
identical, then the goods

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.349
themselves are substitutes.
That's not the point I'm making

00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:28.936
here.
Strategic substitutes is a

00:55:28.936 --> 00:55:31.679
strategy--is a statement about
the nature of the game.

00:55:31.679 --> 00:55:35.620
So strategic substitutes is
telling me that my strategy is a

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:39.561
strategic substitute of your
strategy if the more I do at my

00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:41.807
strategy,
the less you want to do of

00:55:41.807 --> 00:55:44.563
yours and conversely,
the more you want to do of your

00:55:44.563 --> 00:55:55.280
strategy,
the less I want to do of mine.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.679
Now, let's come back to the
question we started with,

00:55:57.679 --> 00:56:00.079
which has to do with profits
and so on in society.

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:02.738
We know that if these players
play these games,

00:56:02.738 --> 00:56:05.340
at least if we believe in Nash
Equilibrium,

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.031
then they're going to produce
these quantities,

00:56:09.031 --> 00:56:13.037
they're going to produce here.
But let's ask a different

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:16.058
question.;
Each of these firms is trying

00:56:16.058 --> 00:56:20.175
to maximize profits,
but how about the total profit

00:56:20.175 --> 00:56:23.170
in the industry?
Each of these firms--we know

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.081
the fact that they're playing
best response--is maximizing

00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:29.300
their profits taking as giving
what the other firm is doing.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.120
But how about total industry
profits?

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:38.746
Are they being maximized here?
Who thinks total industry

00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:41.264
profits are being maximized?
Who thinks total industry

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:43.850
profits are not being maximized?
All right, good;

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.160
shout out.
Total industry profits are not

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.626
being maximized.
Where on the picture--let me do

00:56:50.626 --> 00:56:56.548
a bit more cold calling
here--where on the picture

00:56:56.548 --> 00:57:00.900
maximizes total industry
profits?

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:06.210
We had him before?
No idea?

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.920
You're taking the fifth here?
The guy in there, yeah.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.400
Student: Is it at the
monopoly?

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.110
Professor Ben Polak:
Monopoly, exactly.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.218
So clearly, if we produce the
monopoly quantity,

00:57:16.218 --> 00:57:19.194
by definition,
the monopoly quantity maximizes

00:57:19.194 --> 00:57:21.863
total industry profits.
For example,

00:57:21.863 --> 00:57:26.280
if Firm 2 shut down and Firm 1
produced its monopoly profits,

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.182
that is, a monopoly quantity,
that would maximize firm

00:57:30.182 --> 00:57:34.033
profits.
Conversely, if Firm 1 shut down

00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:39.633
and Firm 2 produced its monopoly
quantity that would maximize

00:57:39.633 --> 00:57:42.910
industry profits.
Where else in this picture

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:46.125
maximizes industry profits?
So this point maximized

00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:50.550
industry profits and this point
maximizes industry profits.

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:56.360
Where else maximizes industry
profits?

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.681
Anybody?
Well, how about all the points

00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:01.792
in between?
Here, Firm 1 produced nothing

00:58:01.792 --> 00:58:05.500
and Firm 2 produced a monopoly
quantity;

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.788
and here Firm 2 produced
nothing and Firm 1 produced a

00:58:08.788 --> 00:58:12.630
monopoly quantity.
But you could also just split

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.680
the monopoly quantity,
for example,

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.422
half half at this point here.
So if the firms wanted to make

00:58:20.422 --> 00:58:24.231
more money, the only thing they
could do is they could sign an

00:58:24.231 --> 00:58:27.782
agreement saying,
why don't each of us produce

00:58:27.782 --> 00:58:31.895
not our Cournot quantity,
but produce half monopoly

00:58:31.895 --> 00:58:35.662
profits.
I'm sorry, half the monopoly

00:58:35.662 --> 00:58:40.570
quantity and that would produce
this much each.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:45.425
So Firm 1 would be producing
half its monopoly quantity and

00:58:45.425 --> 00:58:50.030
Firm 2 would be producing half
its monopoly quantity.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:53.610
So what's wrong with that
agreement?

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:56.516
What are they?
They're two water companies,

00:58:56.516 --> 00:59:00.869
so they're Poland Spring and
Coca-Cola I guess these days,

00:59:00.869 --> 00:59:05.217
sign this agreement saying that
each one's going to produce half

00:59:05.217 --> 00:59:09.013
monopoly quantity and what's
going to go wrong with that

00:59:09.013 --> 00:59:13.409
agreement?
The guy in red.

00:59:13.409 --> 00:59:14.079
Student: First of all
it's illegal.

00:59:14.079 --> 00:59:15.469
Professor Ben Polak:
It's illegal.

00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:17.965
So even without there being an
Attorney General,

00:59:17.965 --> 00:59:21.097
somebody might be awake in the
justice department and notice

00:59:21.097 --> 00:59:24.194
that that's actually illegal.
It's illegal to sign an

00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:27.701
agreement--to sign a contract
saying you're going to restrict

00:59:27.701 --> 00:59:29.337
quantities.
It's illegal,

00:59:29.337 --> 00:59:33.108
so they can't sign that as a
contract, but they they can just

00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:36.639
agree to do it.
So Coca-Cola and Poland Spring

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:41.519
could just agree to produce half
the quantity of water each.

00:59:41.519 --> 00:59:43.980
What's going to go--what might
go wrong in that agreement?

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.616
Let's just suppose that that
game's just been played once for

00:59:47.616 --> 00:59:49.225
now.
Suppose that this is

00:59:49.225 --> 00:59:52.900
Coca-Cola's quantity and this is
Poland Spring's quantity,

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.633
and suppose you're the manager
of Poland Spring,

00:59:56.633 --> 01:00:01.400
so water is coming out of the
ground in Maine for you and you

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.246
know that this Coca-Cola guy is
going to produce this quantity

01:00:06.246 --> 01:00:11.800
here,
so this is q^(M) over 2.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.739
So let's pick on our two
managers;

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:15.342
let's have two people who have
spoken before,

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:16.800
so the guy in the red shirt's
name is?

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.429
Student: Steve.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:18.429 --> 01:00:20.789
Steve, and I guess in red he
should be the Coca-Cola guy,

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:24.080
and let's pick on our Jimmy
Stewart from last week,

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.880
whose name is Patrick.
Can I get a mike in on Patrick?

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.757
So Steve and Patrick are
respectively the managers of

01:00:31.757 --> 01:00:35.933
Coca-Cola and Poland Spring and
Patrick believes that the

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:40.109
Coca-Cola manager is going
to--may be we should just make

01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:44.509
this Coke and Pepsi since two
identical--they're near enough

01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:46.570
and identical,
right?

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.130
So these are Coke and Pepsi,
that will confuse me less.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.473
So Patrick, our manager of
Pepsi believes that Coca-Cola is

01:00:52.473 --> 01:00:55.990
going to produce this quantity
and he's agreed to produce this

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.102
quantity.
What is Patrick actually going

01:00:58.102 --> 01:00:59.999
to do?
Patrick, what are you going to

01:00:59.999 --> 01:01:01.465
do?
Student: So I should

01:01:01.465 --> 01:01:04.162
cheat and pick the quantity on
my best response line that's

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:06.860
much farther out so I'll produce
more than my quantity.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.799
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so Patrick (being Jimmy

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:11.279
Stewart or not,
actually) when he's in

01:01:11.279 --> 01:01:16.216
the--when he's playing the
manager of Pepsi he's going to

01:01:16.216 --> 01:01:21.858
produce more of this undrinkable
liquid and produce this quantity

01:01:21.858 --> 01:01:23.800
here.
So what is this?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:32.332
This is Patrick's best response
to the other guy producing the

01:01:32.332 --> 01:01:37.099
monopoly quantity.
So Patrick's response in Pepsi

01:01:37.099 --> 01:01:40.579
is to overproduce relative to
the monopoly quantity,

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:44.941
actually overproduce even
relative to the Cournot quantity

01:01:44.941 --> 01:01:47.619
and produce all the way out
here.

01:01:47.619 --> 01:01:53.207
Okay, so Patrick's producing
here but what about Mr.

01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:55.380
Coca-Cola guy?
Now, Mr.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.481
Coca-Cola guy knows Patrick
pretty well, they've been in the

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.163
same industry for a while and
Mr.

01:02:00.163 --> 01:02:01.950
Coca-Cola guy,
whose name is?

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.165
Student: Steven.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:02:03.165 --> 01:02:05.831
Steven.
Steven presumably knows that

01:02:05.831 --> 01:02:11.129
Patrick is actually going to
produce this quantity--I'm sorry

01:02:11.129 --> 01:02:14.019
this quantity.
So Steven, what should you

01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:16.112
produce?
Student: Increase my own

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:18.349
production to match my best
response line.

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:20.797
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so Steven,

01:02:20.797 --> 01:02:24.099
anticipating that Patrick is
going to think that Steven's a

01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:27.343
sucker but Patrick's going to
cheat on him and produce too

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:30.184
much,
Steven's going to produce a

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:35.103
best response to that and he's
going to produce this quantity

01:02:35.103 --> 01:02:37.400
here.
So what is this?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:44.705
This is Player 2's best
response, so Player 1's best

01:02:44.705 --> 01:02:52.440
response to Player 2 producing
half monopoly output.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.139
But Patrick knows Steven pretty
well;

01:02:54.139 --> 01:02:57.349
he knows those guys who run
Coca-Cola are pretty smart guys,

01:02:57.349 --> 01:03:00.559
so Patrick knows that the guy
who runs Coca-Cola is going to

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:03.932
anticipate that the guy who runs
Pepsi is going to cheat on the

01:03:03.932 --> 01:03:06.596
guy who runs Coca-Cola,
and hence the guy who runs

01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:09.103
Coca-Cola is going to play a
best response to Patrick's cheat

01:03:09.103 --> 01:03:12.501
on quantity.
So what quantity is Patrick

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:15.314
going to produce?
Student: I'll increase

01:03:15.314 --> 01:03:17.526
my production then;
I'll be pretty close to the

01:03:17.526 --> 01:03:19.758
Cournot equilibrium.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:21.019
right, so you're going to go to
here;

01:03:21.019 --> 01:03:23.570
so this point here is--I can't
even write this.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:28.262
This is the best response of
Player 1 to the best response of

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:32.407
Player 2, to the best response
of Player 1 to Player 2

01:03:32.407 --> 01:03:37.099
producing half monopoly output
and there are lots of brackets

01:03:37.099 --> 01:03:40.686
here.
Can anyone see where this

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:45.255
process is going?
It's going back to the Nash

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.710
Equilibrium.
Each of them is trying to play

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:50.030
a best response for what they
anticipate the other person's

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:52.120
going to do.
And in this game if they keep

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.432
on doing that,
it's going to drag them back to

01:03:54.432 --> 01:03:56.520
Nash Equilibrium.
But I want to be careful here.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.055
This won't be true of all games.
But in this game,

01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:02.556
playing best response to each
other, figuring out that in fact

01:04:02.556 --> 01:04:04.909
the other guy is going to cheat
on me,

01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:06.400
or the other guy is
anticipating that I'm going to

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.648
cheat on him,
or the other guy is going to

01:04:07.648 --> 01:04:09.382
anticipate that I'm going to
anticipate that he's going to

01:04:09.382 --> 01:04:12.264
cheat on me,
etc., etc., will eventually

01:04:12.264 --> 01:04:15.550
drag us back to the Cournot
quantity.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:18.654
So it's going to be pretty
difficult for us to sustain this

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:21.329
joint monopoly output,
this collusive agreement.

01:04:21.329 --> 01:04:24.110
We can't let the courts enforce
it.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.614
We're Coca-Cola and Pepsi,
so we really don't want to have

01:04:26.614 --> 01:04:28.503
to bring the mafia in,
although maybe we do,

01:04:28.503 --> 01:04:30.264
I don't know.
So basically,

01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:34.712
we're stuck with this verbal
agreement and we both have an

01:04:34.712 --> 01:04:38.613
incentive to cheat and produce
more whatever it is,

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:41.222
sugar water.
Now, in practice,

01:04:41.222 --> 01:04:45.674
this is not the only problem
facing two firms who are trying

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:49.213
to produce the monopoly output.
In practice,

01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:53.593
when firms try and have these
agreements, which are not

01:04:53.593 --> 01:04:57.730
contracts, to try and produce
joint monopoly output,

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:01.324
what else goes wrong?
So you can imagine some firms

01:05:01.324 --> 01:05:04.549
trying to have an agreement.
We know they can't sign a legal

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:07.130
agreement, but let's take that
off the table.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.738
So, for example,
in around 1900 in America or a

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:12.460
little bit earlier,
let's say 1880 in America,

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.516
it really isn't clear that it
was illegal to write agreements

01:05:15.516 --> 01:05:17.300
to say we'll restrict
quantities.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.287
So firms did use to write that
kind of agreements,

01:05:20.287 --> 01:05:24.139
but still something went wrong.
What went wrong?

01:05:24.139 --> 01:05:26.493
So we're getting a little bit
further away from the game and

01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:29.090
more back into the real world.
What kind of things went wrong?

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.110
I want to get somebody who's
near a mike.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:36.610
Can I get the woman here with
the Yale shirt?

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.761
Student: Without a
contract there's no means of

01:05:38.761 --> 01:05:40.527
enforcement.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:05:40.527 --> 01:05:42.458
right, so it might be
that--again, the problem with

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:44.389
enforcement--although actually
in 1880 America,

01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:47.343
it's not clear that they
couldn't have enforced that

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.889
contract.
So one problem is

01:05:48.889 --> 01:05:51.779
unenforceability but that
might--far off ago that might

01:05:51.779 --> 01:05:53.900
have been a problem.
What else?

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:59.607
The guy next to her.
Student: If they're not

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:02.905
at the competitive output they
could undercut price and take

01:06:02.905 --> 01:06:04.565
the entire market.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:06:04.565 --> 01:06:06.215
Let's be careful.
We'll come back to that next

01:06:06.215 --> 01:06:08.630
time, but right now we're
competing in quantities.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:11.054
So we're not fixing prices
here, we're not even naming

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.187
price.
We're just producing Coca-Cola

01:06:13.187 --> 01:06:16.664
and Pepsi and for want of a
better word, spewing it out into

01:06:16.664 --> 01:06:21.900
the market.
What else goes wrong here?

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.307
Well, one thing that goes wrong
is that suppose Coke and Pepsi

01:06:25.307 --> 01:06:28.826
were able to--either to write a
contract or whatever--to sustain

01:06:28.826 --> 01:06:31.340
joint monopoly output at this
high price,

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.661
this price which is
actually--producing positive

01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:36.179
profits in the industry--it is
going to turn out,

01:06:36.179 --> 01:06:38.780
therefore the price is going to
be above costs.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:41.481
These firms're making all the
profits, what do you thinks

01:06:41.481 --> 01:06:43.170
going to happen in this
industry?

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.409
This industry that's got a lot
of profit around it,

01:06:45.409 --> 01:06:47.289
what's going to happen in this
industry?

01:06:47.289 --> 01:06:50.320
Yeah, the guy in the blue shirt
here;

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.111
Ale this guy here.
Student: Another

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:56.059
competitor could join the
market.

01:06:56.059 --> 01:06:58.731
Professor Ben Polak:
Another firm is going to come in

01:06:58.731 --> 01:07:00.578
and produce a similar product.
So Dr.

01:07:00.578 --> 01:07:02.900
Pepper or something,
is there one?

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.916
Someone else is going to come
in and produce cola in this

01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:08.880
industry and that's exactly what
happened in the U.S.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.270
at the turn of the last century.
Companies did produce

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:13.054
agreements to restrict,
for example,

01:07:13.054 --> 01:07:15.909
the production of paper and the
production of rubber,

01:07:15.909 --> 01:07:19.541
and the production of steel,
and the production of iron,

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:22.050
and the production of railway
lines,

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:23.900
actually, even quite
complicated things.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.349
Sure enough what you see very
quickly emerging is new entrants

01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:30.813
entering the market to say,
hey these firms are restricting

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.460
their quantities,
we can get in there and make

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.968
money.
So new and a competitive fringe

01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:39.159
of firms is going to enter and
drive prices down.

01:07:39.159 --> 01:07:42.262
Now, I'm talking about 1900
America where has that happened

01:07:42.262 --> 01:07:44.670
in the twentieth century more
dramatically?

01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:48.002
We know the early example in
sort of Golden Age America,

01:07:48.002 --> 01:07:51.395
but where else did we see a
competitive fringe enter when

01:07:51.395 --> 01:07:54.667
there was a collusive agreement
to keep prices--to keep

01:07:54.667 --> 01:07:57.179
quantities down?
Student: Airlines.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:00.090
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so airlines is an example;

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:01.670
we've seen that.
Where else?

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.470
Oil is probably the classic
example.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.500
Airlines is a good example.
Okay, so in oil we all know

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.304
that in the late 60s,
early 70s, OPEC was formed

01:08:09.304 --> 01:08:12.825
precisely to restrict quantity
among the major oil producing

01:08:12.825 --> 01:08:15.053
countries,
and very quickly we see

01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:18.646
companies take--other countries
take advantage of this to start

01:08:18.646 --> 01:08:23.937
producing oil profitably.
So who were the competitive

01:08:23.937 --> 01:08:28.529
fringe against OPEC?
Anybody?

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:32.138
The Brits were for a start,
the Brits--England sort

01:08:32.138 --> 01:08:35.475
of--Scotland I should say.
Britain anyway started

01:08:35.475 --> 01:08:39.275
producing oil in the North Sea;
lots of countries in Latin

01:08:39.275 --> 01:08:43.191
America started looking and
finding oil, and of course,

01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:46.890
Russian oil started being very,
very profitable.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:50.377
So there are various reasons
why it's hard to maintain this

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:53.401
collusive agreement.
One is there's an incentive to

01:08:53.401 --> 01:08:56.689
cheat and another is that other
firms are going to enter.

01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:59.569
Before we leave this,
let's just pose the question we

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.547
started with.
Suppose, in fact,

01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:04.449
we do end up back at the
Cournot quantity.

01:09:04.449 --> 01:09:07.939
So here we are back at the
Cournot quantity.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:12.079
How does this quantity compare
and how do therefore the prices

01:09:12.079 --> 01:09:16.016
compare, and how do profits
compare with monopoly prices on

01:09:16.016 --> 01:09:19.602
the one hand,
and competitive prices on the

01:09:19.602 --> 01:09:22.261
other?
So we know the quantity that's

01:09:22.261 --> 01:09:24.540
going to be produced.
We figured that out;

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.902
here it is.
We know the quantities going to

01:09:28.902 --> 01:09:34.256
be produced.
Each firm is going to produce a

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:40.010
- c over 3b and there are two
such firms.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:48.742
So the total quantity produced
in the market--the total

01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:55.848
quantity will be 2a - c over 3b.
How does that compare to the

01:09:55.848 --> 01:10:00.123
monopoly quantity?
Well, the monopoly quantity was

01:10:00.123 --> 01:10:05.360
a - c over 2b and the
competitive quantity was a - c

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:11.829
over b, just to remind you of
those, they're on our picture.

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:19.420
Here's a - c over 2b and here's
a - c over b.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.201
So this is the total quantity
produced on this equilibrium,

01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:23.880
in this Cournot Nash
Equilibrium.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:30.756
How did it compare to the
monopoly quantity and to the

01:10:30.756 --> 01:10:36.439
competitive quantity?
Anybody?

01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:38.800
Just staring at the board,
which is of these is bigger?

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.668
So I claim that this total
quantity being produced is less

01:10:44.668 --> 01:10:50.434
than the competitive quantity,
but more in total than the

01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:54.235
monopoly quantity.
I was about to get them the

01:10:54.235 --> 01:10:56.939
wrong way around.
Total quantity being produced

01:10:56.939 --> 01:11:00.183
is less than would be produced
under perfect competition,

01:11:00.183 --> 01:11:03.079
but more than would be produced
under monopoly.

01:11:03.079 --> 01:11:05.447
Consequently,
prices are going to go the

01:11:05.447 --> 01:11:08.846
other way and consequently
prices are going to be highest

01:11:08.846 --> 01:11:12.460
under monopoly,
lowest on the competition,

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.380
and somewhere in between in
this Cournot situation.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.365
So from the point of view of
the producers,

01:11:20.365 --> 01:11:23.706
this Cournot Equilibrium is
worse than monopoly,

01:11:23.706 --> 01:11:26.550
but better than perfect
competition.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:29.735
And from the point of view of
the rest of us,

01:11:29.735 --> 01:11:32.920
the consumers,
this Cournot quantity is worse

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.829
than perfect competition but
better than monopoly.

01:11:36.829 --> 01:11:39.595
The only rider on that being,
if they're producing Coca-Cola

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.939
and you have any kind of concern
for your teeth,

01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:46.590
maybe you shouldn't produce so
much anyway.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:50.103
So, so far what we've done is
we've looked at this sort of

01:11:50.103 --> 01:11:53.739
classic, I admit not the most
exciting game in the world,

01:11:53.739 --> 01:11:57.640
but classic application of Game
Theory to imperfect competition.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.472
Next time I'm actually going to
take this a bit further but I'm

01:12:00.472 --> 01:12:03.304
going to leave this game behind
and look at other ways in which

01:12:03.304 --> 01:12:06.000
we could study imperfect
competition using Game Theory.

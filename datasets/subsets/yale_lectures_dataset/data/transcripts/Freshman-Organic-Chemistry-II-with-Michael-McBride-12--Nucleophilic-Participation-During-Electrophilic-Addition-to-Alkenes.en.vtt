00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.633
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: Why do we
have nucleophiles 

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:04.867
attacking things with leaving 

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:07.767
groups on them? 

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.933
What's the orbital that makes
those things reactive, the 

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.200
substrate reactive? 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.367
STUDENT: A high HOMO. 

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:16.600
PROFESSOR: Not the
nucleophile, the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.100
nucleophile's a high HOMO. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.200
It's a low LUMO. 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.333
So when you attack alkyl
halides, it's 

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.233
because of the low LUMO. 

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:32.067
When you attack alkenes, the
characteristic functionality 

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:35.233
of the double bond is mostly
remarkable 

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.867
because it's a high HOMO. 

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:41.433
So we talk about electrophilic
addition to double bonds. 

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.333
So it's low LUMOs that are
attacking 

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.633
double bonds, like H+. 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.600
But many of the reagents that do
this, that are classed as 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.467
electrophilic addition reagents,

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:57.800
also have high HOMOs. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.867
So they also function as
nucleophiles. 

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.967
So the subject of the lecture
today is electrophilic 

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:06.767
addition to double bonds, but
stressing that there's also a 

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.467
nucleophile that may be
participating at the same 

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:14.600
time, that could react with the
LUMO of the alkene, that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.867
is, the pi-star. 

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:23.433
OK, first I wanted to suggest a
problem for you to work on. 

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:27.167
The pinacol rearrangement is a
neat rearrangement. 

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.733
Notice that the way the carbons
are connected together 

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.833
in the product 

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.567
pinacolone is different from the
way they're connected in 

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.867
the starting material called
pinacol. 

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.667
The origin of that name is
interesting. 

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:44.400
It comes from an ancient Greek
word for tablet. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.567
And it was coined in 1859 as a
name for this compound because 

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.467
its crystals were plates. 

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.933
So it was called pinacol because
of the pretty plates 

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.933
of the hydrate crystal. 

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.533
But anyhow, see if this will be
good exercise for you, to 

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.567
draw nice curved arrows that
start where they should start, 

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.533
and end where they should end. 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.333
To show how you do this, it
requires several steps. 

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.500
So that'll be fun for you. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.767
OK, now last time, we talked
about rearrangement. 

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:22.000
In particular, that when you had
acid reacting with the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.300
alkene, you got rearrangement of
the product. 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.333
So for example, you add the
proton to get the more stable 

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.633
cation, the secondary instead of
the primary. 

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.733
But there's a more stable one
still, which is the tertiary. 

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.700
So it involves a methide shift
that we 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.267
talked about last time. 

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:44.267
And the product, then, when you
add water and then lose a 

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:49.267
proton from that group, is this
rearranged alcohol. 

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:52.000
So this could be a problem, if
you wanted to get the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.100
unrearranged alcohol. 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.533
You couldn't do it by
acid-catalyzed hydration. 

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.000
But there's an alternative,
called 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.100
oxymercuration reduction. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.600
So the oxymercuration adds
mercury and OH 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.267
to the double bond. 

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:22.767
But the electrophile is the
mercury +2 cation, 

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:27.367
so one of the acetates comes
off, and you add the mercury. 

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:31.233
And then there's a second
reaction in this sequence. 

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:35.567
First, the oxymercuration, then
a reduction, which avoids 

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:36.433
rearrangement. 

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:39.333
So it gives the alcohol that you
would have expected if you 

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:42.733
hadn't been sophisticated enough
to suspect 

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:47.633
rearrangement of the secondary
to the tertiary cation. 

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.767
Now let's think how this works,
and why it works here, 

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:54.600
when you get a rearrangement,
when you have a proton. 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.700
The proton is small, and isn't
able to overlap well with both 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.500
carbons at the same time. 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
We talked about the fact that it
gives a double minimum. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.633
It can rearrange. 

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.733
Hydrogen, with its electrons,
hydride, can shift the same 

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:14.600
way methide shifted in the
rearrangement we just talked 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.033
about on the previous slide. 

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:22.300
But it goes over a barrier,
whereas mercury is a much 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.100
larger ion, and is big enough to
overlap with both carbons 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.567
at the same time. 

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.933
So it's a single minimum. 

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:31.867
Instead of rearranging over a
bump from one to the other 

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:35.267
side, it lives near the middle.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:37.800
So as shown there, now it's a
Y-bond. 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.200
The electrons that were in the
pi bond, on the carbon-carbon 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.033
double bond, are now shared with
the vacant orbital on the 

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:47.500
mercury cation. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.567
So it's one of those
three-center, two-electron 

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:54.367
bonds that we talked about
before. 

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:58.967
OK, so now, since the mercury is
bonded to both carbons, you 

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:00.267
can't get the rearrangement. 

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:09.433
Now here, we draw resonance
structures to denote the 

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:14.033
bonding that we also can denote
by that Y, upside-down 

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.067
Y, in this case. 

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:19.900
But notice that I haven't drawn
it symmetrical. 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.167
The mercury atom is not in the
middle, halfway between the 

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:24.467
two carbons. 

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:27.267
We can have the three resonance
structures on the 

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:30.633
right, with mercury plus on the
left with the primary 

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:34.967
carbon plus, and on the far
left, with the secondary 

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.767
carbon plus. 

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.933
But that secondary cation would
be thought to be more 

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:42.667
stable than the primary one. 

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:46.600
So it won't surprise you that
the best position for the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.267
mercury is not halfway between
the carbons, but nearer the 

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:54.000
one on the left, so that it's
the most 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.367
important resonance structure. 

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:03.267
And what that means is that the
cation is mostly on the 

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:06.933
secondary carbon, and that bond
is weaker. 

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.567
The bond on the left, the red
bond shown here, is stronger. 

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:14.633
So when the nucleophile comes
in, in the second stage of the 

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.700
reaction when the water comes
in, it attacks that cation, 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.733
not the other one. 

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:22.033
If it were symmetrically
bridged, you would think that 

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.333
it could attack both of them. 

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:25.600
Maybe fifty-fifty. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.200
But in fact, it attacks that
one. 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.767
So it gives this product, that's
the hydroxymercuration 

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:39.567
product, the hydroxymercuration
addition to 

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.800
the double bond. 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.167
That, then, nobody wants that,
but you could remove the 

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:47.733
mercury by treating with a
reducing agent, sodium 

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:49.300
borohydride. 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.633
And it's replaced then by
hydrogen. 

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:57.733
So this subsequent reduction
step by the BH4 anion 

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:00.700
completes Markovnikov hydration.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.700
Notice that it's the same
orientation of alcohol that 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.767
you would have gotten with H+. 

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:09.833
It's the more stable of the two
cations that you could get 

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:13.400
as a primary cation or secondary
cation. 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.300
The nucleophile, OH, went to the
more substituted carbon. 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.867
So it's Markovnikov, it's the
same product you get. 

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:26.100
But you suppressed the
rearrangement by the fact that 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.800
the mercury was bonded to both
carbons at once, and didn't 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800
allow the methide to shift. 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.567
OK? 

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:42.500
Now, this idea of bridging and
unsymmetrical bridging occurs 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.133
also in the addition of halogens
to the double bonds, 

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.667
chlorine and bromine. 

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:51.567
These are examples from the
lecture that Professor Siegel 

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.667
gave last year, so they show you
the way you would write 

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.500
this quickly. 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.033
And notice that the addition of
chlorine adds Cl and OH. 

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:07.867
Cl goes, in this case, to the
primary carbon, and OH to the 

00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:11.000
more substituted carbon,
analogous to the way in the 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.133
previous slide, mercury went to
the less substituted carbon 

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:20.500
and OH, ultimately, to the more
substituted carbon. 

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.333
So it's Markovnikov addition. 

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:28.533
Now what was the electrophile? 

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.733
What was the thing that added to
give a carbon cation 

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:36.067
intermediate in this case here?

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:40.400
OH came in as a nucleophile in
the second step, 

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.833
and then lost a proton. 

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:46.500
Water came in, lost a proton to
give OH. 

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.600
But chlorine must've been the
electrophile. 

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.133
That meant it was something like
Cl+, not Cl minus, which 

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:56.467
you usually think about. 

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:59.433
So let's contemplate this
reaction in 

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:01.967
a little more detail. 

00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:05.167
So here's ethylene, viewed edge
on. 

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:08.833
And an electrophile will attack
its HOMO, 

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:11.200
which looks like that. 

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.033
Now, the electrophile is going
to be chlorine. 

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:19.100
Now, what orbital is the LUMO
of chlorine?

00:09:21.633 --> 00:09:22.900
Cl2. 

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.133
Arvind you got an idea? 

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.133
STUDENT: Sigma-star. 

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:30.167
PROFESSOR: Right, sigma-star
is it.

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:33.833
So let's draw the
sigma-star orbital.

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.833
LUMO is sigma-star, so it
looks like that.

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:41.633
Does that look good to you,
Arvind? 

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:43.800
First, is the energy match good?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.233
Is it an unusually low LUMO,
sigma-star of Cl2? 

00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:50.500
STUDENT: It's probably unusually
low, but it doesn't 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.600
look like the overlap is-- 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.367
PROFESSOR: Ah, it is
unusually low,

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:57.467
because it's chlorine, with that
big nuclear charge, so 

00:09:57.467 --> 00:09:58.600
low energy. 

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.933
But as you say, the overlap is
bad. 

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:05.467
It looks almost orthogonal. 

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:06.967
So what could you do about that?

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.333
How could you increase the
overlap? 

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:09.600
Do you have any idea? 

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:17.933
If you were a nucleophile, a
high HOMO, and wanted to 

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:22.867
attack that LUMO, the sigma-star
of Cl-Cl, where 

00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:24.233
would you approach from? 

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:27.933
Would you approach the way the
ethylene is doing here? 

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:31.367
Where would you come from? 

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:34.333
STUDENT: You'd probably approach
from the top-right. 

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.800
PROFESSOR: You'd approach
from one of the

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.733
ends, where you get the overlap
without hitting the 

00:10:39.733 --> 00:10:41.033
wrong orbital. 

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:44.333
So what do you need to do to the
picture? 

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:45.733
STUDENT: Turn it around. 

00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:45.867
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:48.733
You need to rotate the chlorine,
because you have 

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:50.233
poor overlap here. 

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.267
But if you rotate the chlorine,
it looks just fine. 

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:55.667
So now you can take the
electrons in the HOMO and mix 

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:57.333
them with this pi-star orbital.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:11:00.833
Which means, remember, there's
antibonding, it's an 

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:03.467
antibonding orbital of Cl2. 

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:06.900
So we can draw arrows like this.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.600
Break the Cl-Cl bond. 

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.500
So it looks like a nucleophilic

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.633
substitution reaction. 

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:15.133
And what atom is being attacked
if this is a 

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.800
nucleophilic substitution? 

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.700
STUDENT: Chlorine? 

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.067
PROFESSOR: The chlorine. 

00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:22.967
It's a nucleophilic substitution
at chlorine. 

00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:29.400
OK, so that's what we would get,
where the chlorine plus 

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.300
has attacked the C-C double bond
and formed this 

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.733
three-membered ring, still a
cation. 

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:37.733
And chlorine minus has gone
away. 

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:43.667
It took the electrons that were
in the sigma orbital. 

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:44.667
OK? 

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:47.500
So there's what's going on. 

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.333
So if you consider this product,
the two different 

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:56.000
species in the product as one,
that's the HOMO. 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's where the electrons of this

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.333
chlorine-chlorine bond went. 

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:05.033
That top arrow, the curved
arrow. 

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:08.033
And this is the HOMO - 2. 

00:12:08.033 --> 00:12:10.400
And that, you can see, is
distorted. 

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.100
But it's the pi orbital of the
C-C double bond, mixed with 

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.433
the p orbital on the chlorine,
or some hybrid orbital on the 

00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:23.500
chlorine, to form the bond in
the blue region there. 

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.033
That's where the pi electrons
went. 

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.900
But notice this is HOMO-2. 

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.100
Where is the HOMO, and where is
HOMO-1 of this 

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.533
product pair of things? 

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.333
So let's look at it again. 

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:45.900
Notice that there are two
chlorine-chlorine bonds drawn 

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.567
in this three-membered ring. 

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:50.567
So there must be some other pair
of electrons that's 

00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:53.933
involved, if we can draw two
bonds. 

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:56.567
Where did those other two
electrons come from? 

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:59.533
That other pair? 

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:04.133
Well, we had the LUMO on
ethylene, pi-star, and the 

00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:06.233
HOMO on chlorine. 

00:13:06.233 --> 00:13:08.600
Now, what do you think the HOMO
on Cl2 would be? 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Ruoyi? 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.833
STUDENT: A p orbital chlorine. 

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:23.333
PROFESSOR: So
it's a p orbital on one of 

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:24.967
the chlorines, an unshared pair.

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:30.333
In fact, we now want a chlorine
nucleophile, so it's 

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:31.533
that unshared pair. 

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:34.167
In fact, we want to draw the
molecular orbital that has it, 

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:37.167
the high HOMO. 

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.167
It turns out to be the analog of
pi-star. 

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:45.600
It's not only the p orbital on
the bottom chlorine, which 

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.400
would be relatively high in
energy, but it's a mixture 

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.567
with the p orbital of the other
chlorine overlapping 

00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:55.467
with it, antibonding to raise
the energy. 

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.700
So it's still higher in energy
than it would be if it were 

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.467
just a single p orbital. 

00:13:59.467 --> 00:14:00.900
So it's this orbital here. 

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.900
You see, it's precisely set up
to form good overlap, so its 

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.467
electrons on the chlorine will
be stabilized by the LUMO of 

00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:09.800
the ethylene. 

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.833
At the same time that the
sigma-star orbital of the 

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:17.567
chlorine is stabilizing the pi
electrons. 

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:18.867
So it mixes both ways. 

00:14:18.867 --> 00:14:22.267
The chlorine is both an
electrophile and a 

00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:22.933
nucleophile. 

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:25.800
Two different pairs of electrons
are involved, and 

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.100
that gives the HOMO-1. 

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.933
Which you see. 

00:14:28.933 --> 00:14:33.933
So now we have two pairs of
electrons that are forming 

00:14:33.933 --> 00:14:39.000
those bonds, those new bonds in
the three-membered ring. 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.733
So we can denote that this way.

00:14:46.067 --> 00:14:49.933
Now, where is the HOMO? 

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:51.800
That's just an unshared pair on
the oxygen 

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:51.967
[correction: chlorine] 

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:55.000
that wasn't involved in this,
because it's orthogonal to the 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.767
other bonds, it's in and out of
the plane. 

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:00.133
So that's the HOMO. 

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:05.900
So we've seen the HOMO, the
HOMO-1, 

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.867
and the HOMO-2. 

00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:15.833
There's the LUMO, which is the
antibonding combination of the 

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:19.233
chlorine and the pi. 

00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:22.333
OK, so we've traced this
through, but the crucial 

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:26.033
lesson is that there were two
reactions going on. 

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:29.500
The chlorine acting as a
nucleophile as well as an 

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.300
electrophile. 

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.933
So although you call it
electrophilic addition, and 

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:37.000
sort of imagine that it's Cl+
attacking, in fact, both 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.933
things are happening at the same
time, and two bonds are 

00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:42.233
being formed. 

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.567
Now, what would happen next? 

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:48.367
There's the LUMO, and we have
the HOMO of the Cl minus ion 

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.733
that was formed at the same
time. 

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:55.367
So if those two reacted in the
way shown here, it would be 

00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:58.400
the exact reverse. 

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.733
You would form a new bond
between chlorine and chlorine, 

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:03.933
you would put electrons into
this LUMO, this bond would 

00:16:03.933 --> 00:16:06.733
break, and you'd go back to the
starting material. 

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.933
But there's a different
arrangement that will allow 

00:16:08.933 --> 00:16:13.200
you to go on from here toward
different products, which is 

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.600
to move that chloride, an
independent ion, after all, 

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.767
down to the bottom. 

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:23.100
So now, we have that chloride
unshared pair HOMO and this 

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.900
LUMO, and they can interact with
one another like this. 

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:34.633
What kind of reaction does that
remind you of? 

00:16:34.633 --> 00:16:37.900
Did you ever see a reaction like
that before? 

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.133
STUDENT: An epoxide. 

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:42.333
PROFESSOR: It's like
opening epoxide,

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:44.533
which is in an even more general

00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:47.033
sense, an SN2 reaction. 

00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:51.733
A nucleophile attacking a LUMO,
which is antibonding 

00:16:51.733 --> 00:16:53.933
here, and the leaving group
leaves, it's 

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:56.633
an attack on carbon. 

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:59.100
So that, then, would open up the
ring, and give an addition 

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.933
of two chlorines to the
carbon-carbon double bond. 

00:17:04.933 --> 00:17:07.900
So you could think of it first
as addition of Cl+, and then 

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.433
addition of Cl minus. 

00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:13.267
It's a two-step process. 

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:17.333
But the interesting thing is
that that first step involved 

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:21.133
both a nucleophile and an
electrophile 

00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:24.167
activity of the chlorine. 

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.900
So we could draw it again here.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.767
That first step, it makes two
bonds in the three-membered 

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:32.533
ring while it breaks the
chlorine-chlorine bond. 

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:36.400
So the red is what you normally
think of as an electrophile 

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.700
attacking the double bond. 

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.867
But the blue is a nucleophile
attacking. 

00:17:40.867 --> 00:17:43.700
So it's an electrophilic
addition of Cl2 to an alkene 

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.933
that's both electrophilic and
nucleophilic simultaneously, 

00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:53.100
which generates this so-called
chloronium ion, this 

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.767
three-membered ring
intermediate, which then 

00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:01.500
undergoes an SN2 reaction to
open up and give the product. 

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:09.000
Now, remember, since it's two
steps, the nucleophile in the 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.733
second step doesn't have to be
the chloride. 

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:14.667
It could be some other
nucleophile. 

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:17.933
For example, you could do this
reaction, generate that 

00:18:17.933 --> 00:18:21.500
intermediate, but then have
water come in and be the 

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.167
nucleophile. 

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:26.400
In which case the chloride would
go away, and you'd lose 

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.833
the proton, so the product is
HCl, the product 

00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:33.000
not shown is HCl. 

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:43.967
But, you have the compound
that's called a halohydrin. 

00:18:43.967 --> 00:18:49.667
Now, let's look at the bromonium
ion, which you get 

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:52.033
when you add Br2 and look at the

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:55.067
regiochemistry that's involved.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:58.733
So you have this three-membered
ring, but it's 

00:18:58.733 --> 00:18:59.700
not symmetrical. 

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.100
The bromine I've drawn is more
on the right than on the left. 

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.333
Why would I draw it that way? 

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:07.833
Connor, you have any idea? 

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:09.400
Why not put it in the middle? 

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.233
STUDENT: Because the carbon on
the left is the more 

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.500
substituted one. 

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:13.933
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:17.167
The more substituted carbon on
the left is a better place to 

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:19.067
have a cation. 

00:19:19.067 --> 00:19:21.833
So you have a stronger bond on
the right, a longer, weaker 

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:25.067
bond on the left. 

00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:29.067
So it's an unsymmetrical bridged
bromonium ion. 

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:32.400
And then if the bromine comes
in, backside at the carbon to 

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.300
do its SN2 reaction, you get the
product that's just like 

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.433
the one we've showed before with
chlorine, except it's two 

00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:46.333
bromines that have added in this
case. 

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:50.533
But that's only formed a 24%
yield, in this case. 

00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:52.833
What do you think the dominant
product is? 

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:59.267
Antonia, can you see any
alternative? 

00:19:59.267 --> 00:20:03.233
STUDENT: Can you add to the
other side? 

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:04.233
PROFESSOR: Well, you could
add to the

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.600
other side, but we've just been
talking about-- you mean 

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.500
on the right, rather than on the
left. 

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.533
You could, but that would be not
preferred. 

00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:14.800
You might say maybe steric
hindrance would help it attack 

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.000
from the right. 

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.833
But in fact, it doesn't attack
from the right, because of the 

00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:22.233
unsymmetrical nature, the bond
between bromine and carbon is 

00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:23.600
stronger on the right. 

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.067
The positive charge is bigger on
the left, so that's where 

00:20:27.067 --> 00:20:28.433
the bromide attacks. 

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:30.900
So it's not that it attacks on
the right. 

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.600
But there's another possibility.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.167
Anybody got an idea? 

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:38.833
STUDENT: The water attacks? 

00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:39.233
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:20:39.233 --> 00:20:40.133
STUDENT: The water attacks? 

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:43.167
PROFESSOR: Aha, the water
can attack.

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.600
So in this case, instead of the
bromide, the water can 

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.267
come backside to the carbon, and
do its trick. 

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:55.400
60% yield, in this case, is the
bromohydrin. 

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.367
So this is a competition between
forming the halohydrin 

00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:01.633
and forming the dihalide. 

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.333
And notice that it shows
Markovnikov regiochemistry for 

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:13.267
the reason we've just been
detailing. 

00:21:13.267 --> 00:21:17.033
That the electrophile that added
first was bromine, gave 

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:22.467
the more stable cation, or
unsymmetrically the thing that 

00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:26.033
had more positive charge here,
and that's where the water, 

00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:28.900
the nucleophile ends up, on the
more substituted carbon. 

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.533
But how do we know the ion is
bridged? 

00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:36.733
The same thing would happen if
we hadn't 

00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:38.800
formed that second bond-- 

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.767
right, if it had just been like
H+, if the bromine had 

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:45.067
just attacked to get the more
stable cation rather than a 

00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:46.233
bridged one. 

00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:47.767
How could you know that it's
bridged? 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.333
What effect was there from
bridging 

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:54.900
in the case of mercury? 

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.567
Yeah, Arvind? 

00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:56.533
STUDENT: There'd be no
rearrangement? 

00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:57.867
PROFESSOR: There'd be no
rearrangement. 

00:21:57.867 --> 00:22:01.300
That's one thing you could do,
but there's another as well, 

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.133
another way of showing that. 

00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:08.333
And this is the key to it here,
that it's 

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:09.833
stereospecific. 

00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:14.333
If you start with the trans or
the cis-2-butene you get 

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.233
different stereochemical
dibromides. 

00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:18.833
Stereochemically different
dibromides. 

00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:22.433
But we'll look at them in
another case here. 

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:26.467
Suppose you have a ring compound
like cyclohexene? 

00:22:26.467 --> 00:22:30.933
And you add bromine, you get the
bromonium ion, obviously 

00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:33.200
both bonds in the three-membered
ring have to be 

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.000
on the same face of the
six-membered ring. 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.367
And then, when you have backside
attack by the water, 

00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:45.000
it must form that compound. 

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.567
It can't form the OH on the same
face as the bromine in 

00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:50.467
the SN2 process. 

00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:53.467
It has to be a backside, not a
frontside attack. 

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:58.200
So whether it's the OH, and
you're forming the halohydrin, 

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.400
or whether it's Br minus, and
you attack to form the 

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:07.500
dibromide, in either case, it
has to be a trans product. 

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.867
The bromine and the nucleophile
have to be on 

00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:12.900
opposite sides of the ring. 

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.700
So an unbridged C+, the
nucleophile could have 

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.067
attacked from the top or the
bottom if the 

00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:21.367
bromine weren't bridging. 

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:25.267
So the bridging is evidenced not
only by a lack of 

00:23:25.267 --> 00:23:28.767
rearrangement, but also by the 

00:23:28.767 --> 00:23:30.833
stereochemistry of the product.

00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:33.133
It's an anti addition. 

00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:35.733
The reverse, you'll notice, of
anti elimination, that we 

00:23:35.733 --> 00:23:41.000
talked about in E2 reactions. 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.833
Now how about other kinds of
reagents that can be both an 

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:48.367
electrophile and a nucleophile
at the same time? 

00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:48.833
That do two things. 

00:23:48.833 --> 00:23:50.033
There are a lot of them. 

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:55.300
There are things called
carbenes, there's the reagent 

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.533
involved in hydroboration,
which-- 

00:23:58.533 --> 00:24:01.667
things that have a B-H bond in
them. 

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:06.200
There's a thing called a
carbenoid, which involves 

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.767
these reagents. 

00:24:07.767 --> 00:24:11.000
There's epoxidation, which forms
the three-membered ring 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.700
with oxygen by a peroxy acid. 

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.900
There's ozonolysis, O3 to form a

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.800
five-membered ring, initially. 

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.833
And there's this thing we
referred to last time, where, 

00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:26.867
remember, H2 doesn't have the
proper symmetry of its 

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:30.900
orbitals to add directly to a
C-C double bond. 

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.667
But with the help of a metal, it
can. 

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:35.900
And that's another case where
you have simultaneous 

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.533
nucleophile and electrophile
behavior. 

00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:41.733
So we're going to go through
these, we won't get through all

00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:45.800
of them today, to see how these
reagents work. 

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.900
And finally, there's
polymerization, which is 

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.767
another topic we'll get to then.

00:24:53.767 --> 00:24:56.100
OK, so first, carbenes. 

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.400
There was a fellow named Jack
Hine, who got his PhD in 1950, 

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.533
and went to be a post-doctorate
with Professor 

00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:06.500
Bartlett, your chemical
grandfather. 

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.100
And when Bartlett spoke about
this sometime, he mentioned 

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.467
that the project that Hine
decided to work on, all on his 

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:19.367
own, I believe, without much
guidance from Bartlett as a 

00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:24.000
post-doctoral, was the reaction
of chloromethanes 

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.033
with hydroxide. 

00:25:26.033 --> 00:25:30.767
Now, by 1950, this was pretty
old hat. 

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:37.133
Because the reaction had been
known right from the time of 

00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:40.300
Williamson ether synthesis 100
years earlier. 

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.600
And all this stuff about SN1 and
SN2, E1, E2, had all been 

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.733
done in the 1920s, '30s. 

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:49.400
So this was pretty old. 

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.100
Bartlett described this, he said
it was "about as earthy a 

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.867
research project as could be
appropriate for a 

00:25:55.867 --> 00:25:57.033
post-doctoral." 

00:25:57.033 --> 00:25:59.000
But Hine knew what he was doing.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.300
He had an interesting idea he
was following up on. 

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.867
He found that the reaction with
hydroxide with chloroform 

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:17.000
is very fast. With methylene
chloride is-- 

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.300
wait a second, I've got the
first one is supposed to be 

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.067
CH3Cl I'm sorry, I put it in
there wrong. 

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:26.433
So with methyl chloride, it's
fast. With methylene 

00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:28.300
chloride, it's slow. 

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.367
With carbon tetrachloride, it's
very slow. 

00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:34.533
Now, if you were thinking of the
halogens as roughly like a 

00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:39.700
methyl group, which they're
about the same size, then this 

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.433
looks like the same steric
effect that was well known 

00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:45.200
already in the rates of SN2
reactions. 

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.267
That methyl is faster than ethyl
is faster than t-butyl. 

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:52.467
So that much is sensible. 

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:56.533
But what was interesting was
this: that chloroform is 

00:26:56.533 --> 00:27:03.233
fast. What does that suggest to
you? 

00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:08.167
We saw this before, so just in
general, you saw before that 

00:27:08.167 --> 00:27:13.233
when we were doing SN2
reactions, you had methyl, 

00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:17.533
ethyl, isopropyl, and suddenly,
t-butyl was very 

00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:19.200
fast. What did that suggest? 

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.567
STUDENT: A different mechanism.

00:27:20.567 --> 00:27:22.267
PROFESSOR: It suggested, yeah,
that there 

00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:25.533
is a different mechanism being
involved in that reaction, 

00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:29.533
somehow, since it doesn't fall
in line. 

00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:34.800
Now, what's special about that?

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.267
Well, he also could study the
reaction with this sulfur 

00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:44.667
anion, which is a nucleophile. 

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:47.500
Hydroxide, smaller, better
overlap with 

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.367
hydrogen, is a good base. 

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:55.533
But phenyl sulfide is better as
a nucleophile. 

00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.833
Better at bonding to carbon. 

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:58.633
So it's the thing that would be
doing 

00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:00.500
the SN2 kind of reaction. 

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.233
And that is fast, slow, and very
slow, which makes sense 

00:28:05.233 --> 00:28:06.567
for chloroform. 

00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:12.267
So it's something about OH minus
being a base that makes 

00:28:12.267 --> 00:28:14.433
chloroform unusual, Hine
discovered. 

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.467
So what it is, is when you have
a very strong base like 

00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:26.400
the base from t-butyl alcohol,
t-butoxide, it turns out that 

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.767
you can extract H+. 

00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:34.200
Because the electronegative
three chlorines make the 

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.967
carbon anion sufficiently stable
that it can lose H+. 

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:43.500
It's not a strong acid to lose
H+, but it's much better than 

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.133
having just two or only one
chlorine. 

00:28:48.133 --> 00:28:52.200
So you can do this SN2 reaction
at hydrogen and get 

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.467
the trichloromethyl anion. 

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:58.100
But then, it has a good leaving
group on it, chloride. 

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.933
So you get elimination of HCl
from a single carbon. 

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:08.533
It's alpha-elimination. 

00:29:08.533 --> 00:29:11.400
We talked about beta-elimination
before in the 

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.700
E2 or E1 reaction, where you
take a hydrogen, the proton, 

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.733
off from one, chloride, or
whatever leaving group, off of 

00:29:17.733 --> 00:29:19.200
the adjacent one. 

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.033
But this is losing them both
from the same atom. 

00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:25.767
And chloroform is uniquely set
up to do that. 

00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:28.333
Obviously, carbon tetrachloride
can't do it, 

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:34.933
because it doesn't have the
proton to be lost. So now we 

00:29:34.933 --> 00:29:39.500
have this divalent carbon, which
is called a carbene. 

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.900
And it can come together with
the alkene to form a 

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.133
cyclopropane. 

00:29:47.533 --> 00:29:50.200
So we're going to try to analyze
this in terms of the 

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.367
HOMOs and LUMOs that are
involved in mixing the 

00:29:53.367 --> 00:29:57.367
orbitals of the carbene, the 

00:29:57.367 --> 00:30:01.933
dichlorocarbene with ethylene. 

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.733
OK, so here are our reagents, we
know 

00:30:04.733 --> 00:30:06.133
the orbitals of ethylene. 

00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:10.033
So here's the HOMO of
dichlorocarbene, which turns 

00:30:10.033 --> 00:30:14.567
out to be a bent molecule. 

00:30:14.567 --> 00:30:18.567
And here's its LUMO, the vacant
p orbital. 

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:22.600
Now does that look well set up
to react with ethylene? 

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:29.133
To mix HOMO with LUMO and LUMO
with HOMO? 

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:40.033
Noelle, what's the shape of the
HOMO of ethylene? 

00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:42.433
That's the thing that
electrophiles usually attack. 

00:30:42.433 --> 00:30:44.233
What is it? 

00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:45.500
It's the pi. 

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.533
So it would be positive here,
and positive here. 

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:53.200
Is that well set up to make sure
that this LUMO-- 

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.700
No, because the LUMO, the p
orbital would be plus on one 

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.200
side and minus on the other. 

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.633
They'd be orthogonal. 

00:30:58.633 --> 00:31:02.733
And the same is true, the LUMO
of the ethylene is-- would be 

00:31:02.733 --> 00:31:04.233
plus here, minus here. 

00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:07.733
And this one is symmetrically
between it, and they'd both be 

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:10.200
orthogonal. 

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.000
So both the HOMO-LUMO and the
LUMO-HOMO pairs are 

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.767
orthogonal. 

00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:19.533
So it doesn't look like
dichlorocarbene should be able 

00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:22.500
to do this, to form these two
bonds at once. 

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.200
But there's a way to do it. 

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.400
And the person who can tell us
how to do it is Arvind. 

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.733
STUDENT: We could rotate it
again? 

00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:30.033
PROFESSOR: Aha. 

00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:32.467
We'll rotate it. 

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:36.700
So this is actually the three
frames through 

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.367
the transition state. 

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:41.867
This is just before the
transition state. 

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:46.500
But notice the dichlorocarbene
is coming in sideways rather 

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.433
than head on. 

00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:53.700
So that bond is being formed,
and the two bonds are being 

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.267
formed, the pi are going here,
those in that hybrid orbital 

00:31:58.267 --> 00:32:01.100
here are going into this. 

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.600
So we'll watch the motion here.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.733
Back up, come forward again. 

00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:14.400
So what happens actually as you
go through the transition 

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.000
state is it's rotating. 

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.633
Because it starts getting
overlapped with the thing, and 

00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:23.800
then as the new bonds form, it
goes into the lower energy 

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.833
geometry of the three-membered
ring, which of course has the 

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:28.267
chlorines pointing up. 

00:32:33.733 --> 00:32:37.633
So then, this is the LUMO of
the-- 

00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:42.667
I used difluorocarbene, to have
fewer electrons, in order 

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:43.633
to do the calculation. 

00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:49.033
But then, you see that the LUMO
is the p orbital on the 

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.933
dichlorocarbene, as we
suspected. 

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:56.000
The HOMO is the pi of the
alkene, and they overlap well. 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.967
And then HOMO is that sp-hybrid
on the carbon, and 

00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:03.833
that's well set up to overlap
with the LUMO. 

00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:07.200
So again, you can do both
electrophilic and nucleophilic 

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.433
attack at the same time. 

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:13.967
But it requires coming in
sideways and rotating. 

00:33:13.967 --> 00:33:18.367
OK, now how would we know that
both bonds form at once? 

00:33:18.367 --> 00:33:21.233
Because an alternative mechanism
would be for this 

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.633
thing to act as if it were a
radical. 

00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:26.900
For one electron to come in
here, one electron of the pi 

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.600
bond to go here, the other to go
on here, to give this 

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.167
diradical intermediate, which
then, in the second step, 

00:33:34.167 --> 00:33:36.600
could close the bond. 

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.167
How do we know whether there is
an intermediate like this in 

00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:43.667
the reaction, or whether we just
have a transition state, 

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:46.767
that we just drew, where both of
the bonds are 

00:33:46.767 --> 00:33:47.533
being formed at once? 

00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:51.567
What experimental test can one
perform to see whether both 

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:53.533
bonds are being formed at once?

00:33:53.533 --> 00:33:54.767
Anybody got an idea? 

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.833
Chris, you have any idea of how
you can tell if two bonds 

00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:01.167
are being formed at once? 

00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:08.000
Pardon me? 

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.033
Wells, you have an idea? 

00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:15.233
Have you ever seen an example
before where you could tell 

00:34:15.233 --> 00:34:18.033
that two bonds are being formed
at once, and not one 

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:19.267
bond at a time? 

00:34:22.233 --> 00:34:23.633
Daisuke, you got an idea? 

00:34:23.633 --> 00:34:27.767
STUDENT: It's analogous to SN1
and SN2, so you could figure 

00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:29.600
out the rate. 

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.933
PROFESSOR: Rates are one way
one tries to

00:34:31.933 --> 00:34:34.000
do things like that. 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Ruoyi? 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.967
STUDENT: Stereochemistry? 

00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:37.667
PROFESSOR: Stereochemistry of
the product.

00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.967
Because if you have this
intermediate, if it lasts 

00:34:40.967 --> 00:34:45.433
longer than about 10^-10
seconds, that's how long it 

00:34:45.433 --> 00:34:48.500
takes a single bond to rotate. 

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.833
Something like that. 

00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.933
So you could rotate-- this was a
double bond before, so these 

00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:56.767
two methyls were cis to one
another, both going 

00:34:56.767 --> 00:34:59.133
back into the board. 

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:01.933
But if you get this thing with a
single bond, then it can 

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:06.733
rotate in about 10^-10 seconds,
to have this methyl 

00:35:06.733 --> 00:35:09.833
coming out in front, the other
methyl still in back. 

00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:14.400
And now, you should do that if
you can, because 

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.233
this is less strained. 

00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:18.233
Can anybody see why this would
be less 

00:35:18.233 --> 00:35:21.500
strained than that one? 

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.367
Lauren? 

00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:22.600
STUDENT: The methyl groups
aren't 

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.067
running into each other. 

00:35:24.067 --> 00:35:24.367
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:27.800
In this one, this methyl, is
between this 

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.900
CBr2 and this CH3. 

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.533
It's gauche to both of them, or
something like that, close 

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.300
to both of them. 

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.533
But here, it's rotated to be far
from the methyl. 

00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:43.267
So it's much less strained here,
when it's not between the 

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:46.667
two groups, here, it's between
the CBr2 and the hydrogen, 

00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:51.500
although I've drawn it as if it
were eclipsed. 

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:57.167
So if this is cis and it doesn't
rotate, this product 

00:35:57.167 --> 00:35:58.000
will be cis. 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.367
The two methyls will be on the
same side of the ring, both 

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.133
going back into the board. 

00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:07.367
But if this happens, the product
will be trans. 

00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:10.200
So you do the reaction, and you
find that cis starting 

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.733
material gives only cis product.

00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:18.000
So there wasn't the opportunity
for rotation. 

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.967
Therefore, it must have formed
both bonds either at the same 

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:24.967
time, or within a really, really
short period of time. 

00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:29.300
So fundamentally, what you did
here is time how fast this 

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.667
could have been, how fast this
closure could have been, by 

00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:36.967
knowing something about how
rapidly things rotate. 

00:36:36.967 --> 00:36:42.067
You know this collapse must be
faster than rotation. 

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:44.467
So it doesn't really prove that
there's not an 

00:36:44.467 --> 00:36:47.567
intermediate, it proves that it
doesn't last longer, if 

00:36:47.567 --> 00:36:50.133
there is one, that it doesn't
last longer than 10^-10 

00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:52.767
seconds, which is roughly the
rate at 

00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:54.000
which you would rotate. 

00:36:55.733 --> 00:37:01.200
OK, now the second example was
hydroboration oxidation. 

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.967
So remember we said that if you
had a B-H bond, you could 

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:10.633
add it across a double bond, and
then, treat that in a 

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:13.833
second oxidation step by
reacting with hydrogen 

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:19.100
peroxide and hydroxide, and that
replaces BR2 which people 

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.333
don't want, with OH, which is a
kind of compound 

00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:24.833
that people do want. 

00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:30.867
OK, now, so what this process,
the two steps, hydroboration and

00:37:30.867 --> 00:37:34.700
then oxidation, achieves
addition of water to the C-C 

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.967
double bond. 

00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:41.167
Do you know any other ways to
add water to 

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:42.400
a C-C double bond? 

00:37:46.633 --> 00:37:49.333
Hydrogen plus and water. 

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:53.500
That's what we added, HOH to a
double bond. 

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.700
Oxymercuration and reduction,
which we just talked about, 

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.633
also forms the alcohol. 

00:37:58.633 --> 00:38:02.367
Why do you need another way to
make an alcohol? 

00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:03.400
Sebastian? 

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.167
STUDENT: It's anti-Markovnikov.

00:38:04.167 --> 00:38:07.367
PROFESSOR: Ah, it's
anti-Markovnikov. 

00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:09.967
Let's look at how this happens.

00:38:09.967 --> 00:38:14.733
OK, so here's the BH3, which is
an electrophile, because of 

00:38:14.733 --> 00:38:16.000
the vacant orbital on boron. 

00:38:18.533 --> 00:38:21.067
And this is the motion that will
happen. 

00:38:21.067 --> 00:38:23.500
These electrons that are in the
double bond go 

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.333
in to bond to boron. 

00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:30.000
But at the same time, these
electrons, the B-H bond, an 

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.767
unusually high HOMO. 

00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:33.967
Why is that unusually high, the
B-H bond? 

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.767
The overlap looks good to me. 

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:44.233
But boron doesn't have as big 

00:38:44.233 --> 00:38:47.433
a nuclear charge as carbon. 

00:38:47.433 --> 00:38:49.933
So it's a high energy orbital
for the same reason that bonds 

00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:52.800
in chlorine are low in energy. 

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.733
There's not much nuclear charge
in this one. 

00:38:54.733 --> 00:38:57.400
So this nucleophile is attacking

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.600
pi-star at the same time. 

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.733
So we can again watch this,
watch them stretch and shrink 

00:39:03.733 --> 00:39:06.200
as it goes toward the transition
state. 

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:16.400
So we're breaking this bond,
forming the C-H bond, and 

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.833
forming the B-C bond. 

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:28.433
So, here we're looking at the
orbitals. 

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:35.400
So the LUMO on the BH3 is the p
orbital, the HOMO of the 

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:44.267
alkene is this pi, the HOMO on
the BH3 is that B-H bond, and 

00:39:44.267 --> 00:39:53.900
the LUMO of the alkene is this
thing, which looks ugly. 

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.533
But the reason is that I've
distorted it, to be in the 

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:59.600
shape it would have at the
transition state, 

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.067
not where it started. 

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:06.133
And so that was the transition
state, and you can see that it 

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:09.633
mixes HOMOs and LUMOs, LUMOs and
HOMOs. 

00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:16.800
OK, so then, this then
establishes a B-C bond. 

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.867
Now, the particular one-- it has
an R group on the B. Here 

00:40:22.867 --> 00:40:24.033
I've drawn methyl. 

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:28.100
If this had been formed by
addition of BH to the double 

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.833
bond, there would be another
carbon here. 

00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:34.467
There would have been a double
bond, boron added to one end, 

00:40:34.467 --> 00:40:37.667
hydrogen added to the other. 

00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:42.000
But I've made it, for
simplicity, made it a methyl 

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.267
group, just so we wouldn't have
as much to deal with. 

00:40:44.267 --> 00:40:46.033
And now, I'm going to look at
the 

00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:47.233
second step, the oxidation. 

00:40:47.233 --> 00:40:49.400
So what's the LUMO that's going
to be 

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.667
involved in this reaction? 

00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:59.167
Luke, what do you say? 

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:00.467
STUDENT: The B-C sigma. 

00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:04.467
PROFESSOR: Though if it's going
to be 

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:06.633
vacant, it's not going to be the
sigma, it could be 

00:41:06.633 --> 00:41:07.067
sigma-star. 

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:10.767
But that's not the LUMO, there's
a lower orbital than 

00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:12.167
that of the boron compound. 

00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:13.433
STUDENT: It's, it's-- 

00:41:18.933 --> 00:41:19.467
PROFESSOR: Derek? 

00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:19.700
STUDENT: It's bonded three
times. 

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.767
Boron has a vacant orbital. 

00:41:21.767 --> 00:41:22.933
PROFESSOR: Ah, boron. 

00:41:22.933 --> 00:41:24.767
BX3 from last semester. 

00:41:24.767 --> 00:41:27.367
The vacant orbital on boron. 

00:41:27.367 --> 00:41:28.533
So it has an atomic orbital that

00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:31.000
hasn't mixed with anything. 

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.800
So the lowest orbital is the p
orbital on boron. 

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.033
What's the high HOMO? 

00:41:35.033 --> 00:41:37.633
What's going to react? 

00:41:37.633 --> 00:41:40.267
Amy, you got an idea? 

00:41:43.433 --> 00:41:43.933
Can't hear very well. 

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:44.900
STUDENT: The negative charge. 

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.200
PROFESSOR: Right, the oxygen
that has a 

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.467
negative charge on it. 

00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:49.300
So we can just mix those two. 

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.400
OK, so we've got this, and now
we draw a negative charge on 

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.567
boron, because it gained half
interest in the pair of 

00:41:57.567 --> 00:42:00.967
electrons that was on oxygen. 

00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:05.833
And now we have an interesting
rearrangement that 

00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:09.000
looks a lot like SN2. 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.900
Where is there a low LUMO here
in this molecule? 

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.700
Linda, you have an idea? 

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.100
Can't hear very well. 

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.267
STUDENT: The O-O sigma-star. 

00:42:24.267 --> 00:42:26.467
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the sigma-star
of O-O, 

00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:29.500
because of the high nuclear
charge, like Cl2, or 

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.133
something like that. 

00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:31.633
So low LUMO here. 

00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:34.100
Where is there a high HOMO? 

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.300
Wells, you got an idea? 

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.133
When you look at this whole 

00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:45.333
thing, here, what is there that
tells you that there 

00:42:45.333 --> 00:42:47.233
could be a high HOMO? 

00:42:47.233 --> 00:42:48.067
STUDENT: Negative charge. 

00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:48.467
PROFESSOR: Aha. 

00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:49.667
The negative charge. 

00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:54.600
But that negative charge is not
an 

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.800
unshared pair of electrons. 

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.133
There aren't any unshared
electrons on the boron. 

00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:02.633
So what is the orbital? 

00:43:02.633 --> 00:43:05.900
It has to be one of the sigma
bonds to boron. 

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.567
For example, this sigma bond
here. 

00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:12.267
So here we have a nucleophile,
and here we have an 

00:43:12.267 --> 00:43:13.167
electrophile. 

00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:17.400
Here's the HOMO, sigma-star is
the LUMO. 

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.800
Now, here's the geometry of the
transition state. 

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:27.567
You see, what's happening is
that the CH3 is moving over, 

00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:29.533
taking these electrons with it.

00:43:29.533 --> 00:43:33.767
It's a methide shift, like we
saw in the cation cases, 

00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:38.467
except that in that case, there
would be a cation here, 

00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:41.767
and the CH3 with its electrons
would shift, to give a more 

00:43:41.767 --> 00:43:43.533
stable cation. 

00:43:43.533 --> 00:43:46.100
In this case, it's because you
have the O-O bond. 

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.333
But it's interesting to compare
this transition state 

00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:53.400
with the transition state for an
SN2 reaction of, say, 

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.133
chloride attacking methyl
chloride. 

00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:04.333
So you can see, here's the
nucleophile, the leaving 

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:08.600
group, here's the nucleophile,
the leaving group. 

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.200
And in fact-- 

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:16.467
the sigma-star C-Br is being
attacked here, in that 

00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:20.467
reaction of the SN2, but in this
case, it's sigma-star 

00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:25.467
O-O, and sigma B-C is the
nucleophile. 

00:44:25.467 --> 00:44:29.400
So you see, it looks like the
same reaction. 

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.900
And in fact, if we go to the
transition state, you see the 

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.467
thing bouncing back and forth to
the transition state, but 

00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:40.200
if we look at the orbitals of
the transition state, this is 

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.567
the HOMO for SN2, this is the
HOMO for this rearrangement. 

00:44:44.567 --> 00:44:48.300
You see, the orbitals look
almost exactly the same. 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.133
And if you look at the LUMO for
the SN2, and the LUMO for 

00:44:52.133 --> 00:44:56.300
this rearrangement, it's the
same reaction as SN2, this 

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.567
rearrangement is. 

00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:04.633
So, this is the question that 

00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:08.600
Sebastian has already answered.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.833
Why do this procedure, if all it
does is add H and OH to C 

00:45:12.833 --> 00:45:15.100
double bond C? 

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.833
How about the regiochemistry? 

00:45:16.833 --> 00:45:20.100
And how about the
stereochemistry? 

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.567
So that initial addition adds
BR2. 

00:45:24.567 --> 00:45:28.433
BR2 is now the low LUMO in that
initial addition, before the 

00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:28.833
rearrangement. 

00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:33.433
In the initial addition, B is
the electrophile. 

00:45:33.433 --> 00:45:36.667
So it adds to
the less-substituted carbon,

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.967
so that you get more of the
carbon cation character here.

00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:43.900
And the hydride is what shifts,
remember? 

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.467
It's the hydride that-- 

00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:49.700
B is the electrophile, and the
B-H bond with the hydride 

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.100
shifting is the nucleophile. 

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.533
So it goes to the more
substituted center. 

00:45:54.533 --> 00:45:57.567
So whereas Markovnikov, of
course, knew nothing about 

00:45:57.567 --> 00:46:01.933
HOMOs and LUMOs, nucleophiles
and electrophiles, all he knew 

00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:04.967
was that the hydrogen went to
the place that 

00:46:04.967 --> 00:46:05.867
had the most hydrogens. 

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:08.600
And the other thing went where
there were the most 

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.700
non-hydrogens. 

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:15.333
But the other thing in this case
is BR2, which turns out 

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:18.300
to be the electrophile, not the
nucleophile. 

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.700
In the other cases, the other
thing not hydrogen was the 

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.300
nucleophile. 

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.267
Now it's the electrophile. 

00:46:24.267 --> 00:46:28.100
So it gives the opposite
orientation here from what 

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.533
Markovnikov probably would have
said, but for the same 

00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:35.233
reason that explains Markovnikov
addition. 

00:46:35.233 --> 00:46:39.500
And now, when we do the
rearrangement, what we do is 

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:44.433
put the oxygen on boron, and
then have this whole R group 

00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:45.600
shift over. 

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.800
But that's a frontside attack. 

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:55.400
It's the sigma orbitals of this
R-BR bond that are doing 

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.300
the attacking. 

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:07.667
So it's frontside at that, it
comes in and the OH 

00:47:07.667 --> 00:47:09.367
replaces the BR2. 

00:47:09.367 --> 00:47:11.967
It's not a backside situation. 

00:47:11.967 --> 00:47:15.567
So you get that. 

00:47:15.567 --> 00:47:18.700
So the alcohol product is syn. 

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.600
The two things that have added
are on the same face, not on 

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.000
opposite faces. 

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.133
And it's anti-Markovnikov. The
OH now is on the opposite 

00:47:29.133 --> 00:47:32.667
place from where it would go by
these other mechanisms of 

00:47:32.667 --> 00:47:33.400
adding the alcohol. 

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.833
So this is a great boon, then,
if you're in the synthesis 

00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:41.633
business, and need to prepare an
alcohol where the OH is on 

00:47:41.633 --> 00:47:43.467
the less-substituted carbon. 

00:47:43.467 --> 00:47:46.867
So it's anti-Markovnikov. So you
contrast that with acid- 

00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:51.767
catalyzed hydration, which would
give this cation, or 

00:47:51.767 --> 00:47:55.733
pardon me, this alcohol, which
is the Markovnikov product. 

00:47:55.733 --> 00:47:59.567
How about the stereochemistry in
this case, is it cis, or 

00:47:59.567 --> 00:48:03.000
was it syn addition or anti
addition? 

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.933
Did H and OH come in on the same
face, or opposite faces? 

00:48:10.933 --> 00:48:12.167
Cassie? 

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.733
Can't hear. 

00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:21.900
You can't tell, here, right? 

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.433
Because there are two H's. 

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:27.400
So it's a clear choice in this
case, where it was 

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.333
anti-Markovnikov. When it's
Markovnikov, and the H goes 

00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:33.367
where there are already H's,
there is going to be this 

00:48:33.367 --> 00:48:35.200
ambiguity, unless you did what?

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:35.667
STUDENT: Put a D in. 

00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:38.767
PROFESSOR: Put a deuterium in,
then you 

00:48:38.767 --> 00:48:41.033
can tell that it is syn. 

00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:43.367
But it appears random. 

00:48:43.367 --> 00:48:45.567
Oh, no, pardon me. 

00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:48.133
It not only appears random, if
you did it with deuterium, you 

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:51.933
would find that it is random,
because you generate a cation 

00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:56.233
intermediate here when you add
protons first. And that could 

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:59.000
be attacked from either side. 

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.233
So it's syn here, but random
down here, and 

00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:03.733
that's enough for today.

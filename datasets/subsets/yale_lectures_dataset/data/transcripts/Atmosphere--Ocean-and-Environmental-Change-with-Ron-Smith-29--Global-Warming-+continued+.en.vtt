00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:04.333
RONALD SMITH: The first
question was one of the

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:09.000
most difficult ones
on the exam, I believe.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.133
And the point is that you were
given, first the Gulf Stream

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:22.700
coming up along the east coast
of the United States.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.500
At a particular latitude, 35
degrees North, you are given

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.700
information that this is 50
kilometers wide, has a depth

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:46.533
of 1 kilometer, and the pressure
difference across it

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:55.800
Delta P, is given
by 4000 Pascals.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.233
And you are asked to compute how
much water is flowing, the

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.733
volumetric flow rate, in
the in the Gulf Stream.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.500
So the way I did it was first
to use the formula for

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.800
geostrophic speed, which is
the pressure difference

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.600
divided by the length over which
the pressure changes.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.167
That's the so called
pressure gradient.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:29.667
And then down below goes 2, the
density of water, times

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.833
the rotation rate of
the earth, times

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.300
the sine of the latitude.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.667
That formula is given to you at
the top of the second page.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:44.333
You just need to cancel out the
volume and solve for U,

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.467
and you'll get that formula
for geostrophic flow.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:56.033
So then what goes into this is
a Delta P of 4000 Pascals, a

00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:05.967
length of 50 kilometers, 50,000
meters, 2 the density

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:08.600
of seawater is about a 1025.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.667
The rotation rate of the earth
is 7.27 x 10 to the minus 5.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:19.000
And the sine of the latitude,
it's going to be the sine of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
35 degrees.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.467
When you put in all those
numbers, I got 0.9 meters per

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:34.400
second for the speed of flow
in the Gulf Stream.

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:43.300
To get the volumetric flow rate,
that's going to be the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.667
rate of the product of the
area and the flow speed.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.133
The area is given by
the product of the

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.600
depth and the width.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.900
So it's going to be 50,000
meters times 1000 meters.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:11.167
So that's going to be 5 times
10 to, what the seventh?

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:15.933
So when you put this value into
there and this value into

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:21.900
there, I got about 47
x 10 to the sixth

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.433
cubic meters per second.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:28.700
That's the volume, how many
cubic meters of water per

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.767
second are passing through some
line you draw across the

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:33.333
Gulf Stream.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:43.600
I asked you to express
that I asked you to

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.300
express that in sverdrups.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.200
A sverdrup is 1,000,000 cubic
meters per second.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.500
So this is 47 sverdrups.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.467
Any questions on that?

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:57.433
Yes.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:58.833
Student: What is the--why is
that the same as the lenght?

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:04.633
PROFESSOR: This is the,
well sorry.

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:05.767
So this is a pressure
gradient.

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.600
So it's how pressure changes
with distance.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.500
So I may have messed up my
symbols here, but that would

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.667
be that distance.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.000
I gave you the pressure
difference

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.433
across the Gulf Stream.

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.333
I gave you the width
of the Gulf Stream.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:22.767
And so the pressure difference
divided by that length over

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:26.533
which the pressure changes
is the pressure gradient.

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.533
That is units of Pascals
per meter.

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:34.767
How much does this pressure
change per meter as you walk

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:37.900
across or swim across
the Gulf Stream?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.333
Questions on that then?

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.733
Student: So is the pressure
gradient force not pushing the

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:50.367
air in the direction it's
moving, it's actually pushing

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:51.100
it across--

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.200
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.633
So presumably there'd be a high
pressure over here, low

00:04:57.633 --> 00:04:58.667
pressure over there.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:02.400
So if you were to do a little
force balance on a piece of

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.800
water in the Gulf Stream, the
pressure gradient force would

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.400
be off in that direction
from high to low.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.167
Because there's higher pressure
on that side of the

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.267
parcel that on that side.

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:19.633
And that would have to be
balanced by a Coriolis force

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:21.000
equal and opposite to that.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.367
And then in order to get that
Coriolis force, the fluid

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:27.567
would have to be moving in that
direction, that's you, so

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:30.600
we have that right angle
relationship between the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.500
velocity of the material
and the Coriolis force.

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:43.533
So I didn't ask you about the
direction, but it would be off

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.700
to the Northeast, the
way I've drawn

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.900
everything in this diagram.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.500
Other questions on that?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.400
OK, question two.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.267
Now for that you needed this
diagram on the next page.

00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:02.467
And what I recommended
Are you all set?

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:04.933
I'm going to withdraw it because
I'm not ready to use

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:05.500
the board yet.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.467
But that's terrific.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:07.133
Thanks so much.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:07.433
I appreciate that.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.800
AV Guy fixing projector: I would
just blank it at the

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.633
moment if it's

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:10.600
PROFESSOR: That's fine.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.367
How do I blank it?

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:12.767
Blank it.

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:13.533
Yes.

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:15.700
Yes, terrific.

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:27.033
So you were given the
temperature and salinity for

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:34.500
two water masses and you could
plot them on this S-T diagram.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.933
And A plots up here
somewhere and B

00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:39.633
plots down there somewhere.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.667
And from the lines of constant
density, which I'm not going

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:43.700
to be able to draw very
accurately, you can find that

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.567
B is more--so I've got
the numbers there.

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:56.700
So the density for B was 1027.5
and the density for A

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:05.900
was 1026.5 units kilograms
per cubic meters.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.233
Now I mentioned in class that
quite a number of you have

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:13.433
forgotten that you need to put
a 10 in front of the numbers

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:13.900
that are given here.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:20.600
For example these things are
written something like 27.5.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.233
You need to make that into
1027.5 in order to have proper

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:30.800
units of kilograms
per cubic meter.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.733
To remember that, you could look
back at the properties of

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:40.200
water on the front page, where
I give a typical density for

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.900
seawater as 1025 kilograms
per cubic meter.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.233
A number like 27.5 would be
ridiculous for water.

00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:57.133
That would be a factor
of 100 too light.

00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:01.700
The other thing is then A turns
out to be less than B.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.300
And therefore because density
must increase going down,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.967
water mass A must be
the higher one

00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:09.700
in the water column.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.033
And that was the second
part to that question.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:18.900
Question three, I used the
formula, change in salinity is

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.767
given by the initial salinity
minus d over capital

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:24.667
D plus little d.

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:28.233
And the problem said the heavy
rain adds a half meter.

00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:33.833
So d is plus 0.5 meters.

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:44.633
And that fresh water is mixed
down to a depth of 50 meters.

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:48.967
So the effect of that added
fresh water is felt all the

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.367
way down to 50 meters.

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:55.667
That means I put in 35 parts per
thousand for S0 and then

00:08:55.667 --> 00:09:04.200
it's minus 0.5 over 50 plus 0.5
and that comes out to be

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.300
minus 0.346 parts
per thousand.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:17.333
And because the original
salinity 35, the new salinity

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:21.767
is then 34.65 parts
per thousand.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:24.767
I just subtracted
that from the 35

00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:29.333
to get the new salinity.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.733
Questions on that?

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:36.100
Question four was about El
Nino and in the eastern

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.533
tropical Pacific, so in the east
there, the SST would be

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:45.133
higher than usual, the air
pressure would be lower than

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:49.433
usual, precipitation higher
than usual, biological

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.767
productivity lower than usual.

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:55.100
And explaining the relationship
between A and D,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.000
that would be like this.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.500
So if you have warm water near
the surface and cold water

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.233
beneath, it's going to be very
difficult for nutrient rich

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:13.133
waters to reach the surface
because of that stability in

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.867
the water column.

00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:18.400
If the nutrients can't reach the
euphotic zone, then you're

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.733
going to have low biological
productivity.

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:28.767
Question five was about the
last glacial maximum.

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:33.367
CO2 in the atmosphere was low,
the isotopes in fresh snow on

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:37.433
Greenland would be lighter than
normal, because in that

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:42.333
cold condition there would be
more precipitation between

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.033
source and Greenland.

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:47.633
More water would have been
rained out, the heavier

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.467
isotopes rain out,
you end up with

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:51.000
lighter ones on Greenland.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.367
The isotopes in deep sea
sediments would be heavy

00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:58.733
because with ice stored
on land, it would be

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:00.400
isotopically light.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.433
The remaining water in the ocean
would be isotopically

00:11:03.433 --> 00:11:06.267
heavier and the sediments
would have picked up and

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:09.533
retained that signal.

00:11:09.533 --> 00:11:14.133
Sea level would be low because
water is stored on land.

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:18.600
So then the relationship
between C and D, oxygen

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.433
isotopes in deep sea sediments
in sea level, well I've just

00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:26.100
said that, so sea level low
means that water is being

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.833
stored on land in
the ice sheets.

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:33.033
And because that is light
isotopes, because of the

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:34.933
evaporation process,
that's going to

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:38.100
make the oceans heavy.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.367
Questions on that?

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:47.333
In recent centuries we have
a perihelion in January.

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.000
Explain how the climate would
be different if due to

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.133
procession--

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:53.700
All right, so let me put on the
board this side review of

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.733
the plane of the ecliptic.

00:11:56.733 --> 00:12:03.867
The sun will be off center and
earth will be here and here.

00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:05.467
And this will be today.

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:13.900
But this will be say 10,000
years from now.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:27.700
And today the perihelion is in
January, which means the tilt

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.967
of the earth is like that.

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:37.967
If it was going to be in June,
then we know that the tilt of

00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:41.800
the earth would be like this,
because this is northern

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.433
hemisphere summer,
which is June.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.267
So the tilt is like that.

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:53.067
So then what I wanted you to
explain was basically how

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:55.333
these two climates would
be different.

00:12:55.333 --> 00:13:00.633
And one thing is that in this
season the northern--

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:04.000
in this situation, the northern
hemisphere summers,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.133
being perihelion,
would be warmer.

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:12.000
The northern hemisphere winters
would be colder

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.367
because of that distance.

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:15.900
So the northern hemisphere
seasons would be stronger.

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:22.033
The southern hemisphere seasons
would be weaker,

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:25.500
because in the winter tilted
away, you're closer to the

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.000
sun, tilted towards, you're
further from the sun.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.600
So the proper answer would be
that the intensity of the

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.167
seasons would be changed, but
oppositely early in the

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.400
northern and southern
hemispheres.

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:46.667
Questions on that?

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:50.500
Sea ice is frozen seawater.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.533
Thickness, let's say
1 to 4 meters.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:59.233
Salinity, it starts
out as seawater.

00:13:59.233 --> 00:14:02.933
It loses quite a bit
of its salt when it

00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:04.167
freezes, but not all.

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:10.200
So a typical salinity for sea
ice is between 5 and 20,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.133
somewhere in that range,
whereas seawater is 35.

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:17.633
Icebergs on the other hand are
compacted snow, an entirely

00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:20.833
different origin than sea ice.

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:24.333
And their salinity is
essentially zero, since it's

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:31.867
fresh water snow has fallen
on the glacier.

00:14:31.867 --> 00:14:36.000
Whatever formed the iceberg.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.700
Questions there?

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.967
Student: You said that the
salinity of sea ice is what?

00:14:39.967 --> 00:14:42.467
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:45.700
Now it may be that if it's been
floating in seawater for

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.000
a while a little bit of seawater
has kind of worked

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.867
its way into some
of the cracks.

00:14:50.867 --> 00:14:56.933
But if you find a chunk of pure
ice in the iceberg, it'll

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:01.100
have 0 salinity because it came
from fallen snow some

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.700
years or centuries before.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.333
Student: Sea ice.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.967
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry
you asked me about sea ice.

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:08.300
Sorry.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.967
I answered the wrong question.

00:15:09.967 --> 00:15:17.100
Sea ice is fresher than
ocean water, but has

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.400
some salt in it.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.867
Yes?

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:21.767
Student: Can I talk you
after class about

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.000
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.800
OK.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.067
Now question eight.

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:33.400
What was the question?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.567
OK.

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:35.633
Recent trends in sea ice.

00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:40.500
So you may recall that it's
conventional to judge both of

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.567
these in September.

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:44.533
Now in the northern hemisphere,
September is the

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:49.467
minimum in sea ice and in the
southern hemisphere that's the

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:50.367
maximum in sea ice.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:54.500
But that makes sense because in
the northern hemisphere the

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.900
maximum in sea ice, which occurs
say in March or April,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.300
fills the entire basin.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:07.300
So it's not a question of cold
conditions giving us more sea

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.233
ice in winter in the Arctic
Ocean, it's already coast to

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:14.933
coast. Now a little more may
spill out into the Pacific and

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:17.967
the Atlantic, but in terms of
the Arctic Basin, it's full.

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:20.967
So that would not be a sensible
way to measure

00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:24.267
changes in the arctic sea ice.

00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:29.267
And for the southern ocean, at
the end of the warming season,

00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:30.700
there's very little
sea ice left.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.833
It retreats mostly right back
to the coast. And so that

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.333
wouldn't be a sensible
way to measure.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.733
Instead we measure it at its
maximum in the southern

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:42.667
hemisphere, which
is in September.

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:49.633
Anyway in the arctic, sea ice
is rapidly decreasing.

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.467
In the southern ocean it's
approximately constant by the

00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:55.833
measure I've just described.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:17:01.733
Question nine is computing
the mass of salt

00:17:01.733 --> 00:17:03.567
in the world ocean.

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:08.733
What I thought you would do
there was to estimate the

00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:10.700
depth of the ocean at
about 5 kilometers.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.267
Estimate the surface area
of the ocean as

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:19.300
about 2/3 of the global.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.067
Multiply the two together to get
a volume of ocean water.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:31.500
Multiply that times density to
get a mass of ocean water, and

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.833
then use the salinity of 35
parts per thousand to

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.700
get how much salt.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.367
And I ended up and your number
may be slightly different than

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:50.967
mine but I ended up with about
60 x 10 to the 18th

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:54.000
kilograms of salt.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.133
Was the answer I got.

00:17:55.133 --> 00:17:55.400
Yes?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.000
Student: When you're converting
from volume to mass

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.800
are you using density of
water or seawater?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.000
PROFESSOR: I think
I used sea water, but the

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.100
difference is very slight.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.733
It's only 1025 versus 1000.

00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:16.567
So your answer would be off by
if you chose one versus your

00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:20.833
other, the answer would be 2%
different, which I don't think

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.933
for a rough calculation like
this is very significant.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.867
Finally question ten.

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:37.667
The Little Ice Age is the cool
period I'm sorry what was

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:40.800
question 10a?

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.000
Antarctic bottom water.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.533
Antarctic bottom water
is I changed the

00:18:43.533 --> 00:18:45.233
exams. It's an old version.

00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:51.000
The Antarctic bottom water is
that cool, cold water mass in

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.833
fact, formed at the bottom of
the ocean, formed near the

00:18:55.833 --> 00:18:57.067
shores of Antarctica.

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:02.533
A terminal moraine is a pile of
rock and soil deposited at

00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:04.600
the tip of a moving glacier.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.867
Equatorial upwelling is rising
water from the diverging Ekman

00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:13.767
Layer, flow at the equator,
due to a reversal in the

00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:15.833
Coriolis force.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:21.400
Mid-ocean ridge is the shallow
region of water, of shallower

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.067
depth in the ocean connected
with where ocean crust is

00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:29.733
being created by solidifying
material from the mantle and

00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:36.500
then it's a spreading center for
ocean crust. And the Ekman

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:43.400
Layer is the ocean flow driven
by wind stress at right angles

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.167
to the wind.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:49.033
You could also have talked
about, well the fact--what

00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:51.667
kind of a force balance it
has, but some kind of a

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:55.667
definition of the Ekman Layer
there was needed.

00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:57.100
OK.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.333
So that's exam three.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.067
So we're going to finish
up the discussion--

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:29.533
Question.

00:20:29.533 --> 00:20:29.967
Julia.

00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:31.800
Student: What was the
average of the exam?

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.133
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.767
Do you guys know what the
average is on this?

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:38.500
82.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.733
Better than last time.

00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:43.433
Was that the other
question too?

00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:45.133
Yes.

00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:47.567
So we're going to finish up the
global warming discussion

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:52.233
today by talking about
emission scenarios.

00:20:52.233 --> 00:20:53.733
Now again, the primary
reference

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:56.100
here is the IPCC reports.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.700
So everything in the diagrams
I'm showing are almost

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.633
entirely from the IPCC reports
which you have, or you can get

00:21:02.633 --> 00:21:03.400
very easily.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.633
But there's another report
as part of it, SRES.

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:13.567
It also is on the IPCC website
which stands for What

00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:15.233
does it stand for?

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:21.100
Special Report on Emission
Scenarios.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.700
And I'll be talking
about that today.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.700
It should have been easy
to remember, given the

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.933
title of the slide.

00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:31.833
So the idea is here that some
economists and some industrial

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:36.967
engineers got together to
imagine how the emissions of

00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:41.167
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
might proceed over

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:44.733
the next 100 years, based on
certain population and

00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:46.967
economic assumptions.

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:48.633
And they tried quite a
variety of different

00:21:48.633 --> 00:21:50.733
things, as you will see.

00:21:50.733 --> 00:21:53.633
And then for each of those, they
handed those off to the

00:21:53.633 --> 00:21:55.367
climate modelers.

00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:58.933
And the climate modelers ran
their climate models with

00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:02.733
these different carbon dioxide
concentrations.

00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:07.400
And the result is a set of
projections into the future of

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.367
how both CO2 and Earth's
climate will change.

00:22:11.367 --> 00:22:13.567
And that's what we're going
to talk about today.

00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:22.833
So here are most of the IPCC
emission scenarios.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:37.300
Time is on the x-axis
from 1990 to 2100.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.533
Emission rate is on the y-axis
in units of gigatons

00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:44.000
of carbon per year.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.633
Gigatons of carbon per year.

00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:49.633
Remember that's not the mass of
CO2, that's the mass of the

00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:50.967
carbon in the CO2.

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:57.900
So if you want to compute the
math of carbon dioxide, just

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.367
correct for the ratio of the
molecular weight of a carbon

00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:06.800
dioxide molecule to the
carbon by itself.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.733
44/12 would be that
ratio, right?

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:12.367
Carbon dioxide is
44, carbon 12.

00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:12.733
So yes.

00:23:12.733 --> 00:23:16.500
Just multiply these
times 44/12.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.633
And the A1 is broken up into
some subcategories.

00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:28.100
Generally the As have quite a
bit of increasing emissions

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.700
over the next 100 years.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.067
The two B scenarios are a
little more optimistic.

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:38.200
they climb and then declined
for B1, or climb and then

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.233
increase at a very much
slower rate for B2.

00:23:46.933 --> 00:23:53.233
These documents were published
using data from about 2000 and

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:59.600
projecting it from about 2002
and we have a few years now to

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.500
look and see which of these
lines we've been on the last

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.667
five years.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.300
It's a little bit hard to
tell, because they don't

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.867
diverge so strongly in
the first few years.

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:11.233
They're all pretty similar.

00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:15.167
But from the articles I've read
recently, it looks like

00:24:15.167 --> 00:24:20.367
we're a bit closer to the higher
projections than we are

00:24:20.367 --> 00:24:23.367
to the lower ones, if you look
what's happened over the last

00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:24.300
five years.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.700
Now, this may have changed a bit
since 2008 when we began

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.400
to have these economic
difficulties.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.600
So you're going to want to read
the literature carefully,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.133
but as of about 2008, 2009, it
looks like we were on some of

00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:44.200
the more discouraging
trajectories, in

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.000
terms of CO2 emissions.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.133
Now from these, with a little
bit of understanding about how

00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:56.100
carbon is put back into the
biosphere, you can come up

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.333
with total cumulative Well
sorry, this is just

00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:01.033
summing them up.

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:04.733
Total carbon dioxide cumulative
emissions, so just

00:25:04.733 --> 00:25:09.233
adding those together to get
the different scenarios

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:10.700
expressed in a different way.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.433
From that, with a bit of
understanding of how some of

00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:19.300
that carbon dioxide will be
recycled back into the

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.467
biosphere, you can come
up with carbon dioxide

00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:28.933
concentration projections
over the next 100 years.

00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:31.567
I don't know why this
artist has put the

00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:32.700
two up on top there.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.933
That's not a conventional
way to write CO2.

00:25:35.933 --> 00:25:37.433
So don't be misled by that.

00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:40.967
I think this diagram is still
accurate in spite of that loss

00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:43.867
of credibility given
by putting the two

00:25:43.867 --> 00:25:46.433
in the wrong place.

00:25:46.433 --> 00:25:51.967
But again, you see that the B1
scenarios are leveling off,

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:55.500
whereas the A scenarios are
climbing very rapidly,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:02.800
especially the A2 scenario,
which has us reaching over 800

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.800
parts per million by volume
by the year 2100.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.233
Now are you familiar with this
organization called 350.org?

00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:15.400
So this is what's his name,
McKibben's organization.

00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:21.800
With some scientific basis, I'm
not sure everyone would

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.300
agree, but with some scientific
thought, they've

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.433
decided that 350 should
be the limit we should

00:26:27.433 --> 00:26:29.467
strive for on CO2.

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:31.367
But remember, we've already
passed that.

00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:35.200
We're at 397 already.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.233
So but just for record, you
could put that on this

00:26:38.233 --> 00:26:42.867
diagram, 350.org would have you
put the limit right there.

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:47.267
It helps you to understand how
far in exceedance of that

00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:52.867
number we are and will
be in the future.

00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:55.300
Any questions on this diagram?

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:55.567
Yes.

00:26:55.567 --> 00:27:01.100
Student: What are the different
criteria they used

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.100
to create different scenarios?

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.700
PROFESSOR: I don't have those on

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.600
the tip of my tongue.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.267
They have to do with the way
certain economic sectors will

00:27:12.267 --> 00:27:16.833
develop and that way--which
countries will dominate

00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:20.567
production of certain items.
It's rather detailed, and that

00:27:20.567 --> 00:27:22.533
SRES report goes into that.

00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:25.000
It makes rather interesting
reading.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.800
I apologize for the fact that
I don't have those different

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.100
economic definitions prepared.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.667
Student: But it's based on
the economic growth?

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.600
PROFESSOR: Economic
growth, economic--

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.467
where production occurs.

00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:40.233
Not only a total gross, but in
what country production shifts

00:27:40.233 --> 00:27:41.267
to and things like that.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:42.000
Student: So it takes into
account shifts to different

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.267
forms of energy?

00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:44.900
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.033
Some of that's in there too.

00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:46.500
That's right.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.767
That's right.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.800
So now the climate modelers
perform their magic.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.000
And as you know, there's about a
dozen or so of these climate

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.367
models run by different groups
around the world that do these

00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:03.000
projections.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.333
So you get a lot of different
projections.

00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:09.967
The number of things gets
multiplied because we now have

00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:12.067
all these different scenarios,
and we have all the different

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.367
models running on all the
different scenarios.

00:28:14.367 --> 00:28:16.300
So you get a lot of
different output.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.067
It's a little hard to
manage sometimes.

00:28:18.067 --> 00:28:21.567
But I want to show
you this diagram.

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:24.367
Again, this is from
IPCC report.

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:30.633
It shows the surface warming
a based on a pre-industrial

00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:37.133
reference and versus
time, 1985.

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.467
This just only goes to 2025.

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:42.633
This is a short time
scale here.

00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:46.600
It shows something called
the commitment curve.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.467
That is code for constant
composition.

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:54.267
In other words, that essentially
says no further

00:28:54.267 --> 00:29:00.133
CO2 emissions starting in the
year 2000, essentially.

00:29:00.133 --> 00:29:04.267
Now the temperature does
continue to climb on that,

00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:09.533
because even with constant CO2
emissions, you still have to

00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:10.733
warm up the oceans.

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:13.467
Remember the oceans are putting
a lag on all of this,

00:29:13.467 --> 00:29:16.800
because of their enormous
heat capacity.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.500
So this continued rise is due
to mostly trying to warm up

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.533
the oceans, even though
the greenhouse

00:29:24.533 --> 00:29:26.467
effect is kind of fixed.

00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:27.433
Question, yes.

00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:30.333
Student: Is that only
anthropogenic on the outside,

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:32.267
or is it all across
the outside?

00:29:32.267 --> 00:29:34.567
PROFESSOR: Well it's
constant atmospheric

00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:36.500
composition, is the
way it's defined.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:36.767
[Correction: The assumed carbon
dioxide concentration

00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:57.067
is about 370ppmv).]

00:29:57.067 --> 00:30:00.900
And then these different
scenarios follow each other

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.267
pretty closely over
this time frame.

00:30:04.267 --> 00:30:06.900
But if you remember back to the
emissions scenarios, or to

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:12.100
the composition one, your past
2025 before they really

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.200
diverge very much.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.833
So it's not surprising that even
though these scenarios

00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:20.900
are wildly different, you don't
see much of that up to

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.900
the year 2025.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.600
But you do see a lot of rise.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.433
I mean now you're up to a degree
or so of warming and

00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:35.433
the rate is rather impressive.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:38.367
Now when you go out to a much
longer time scale, that's when

00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:39.733
you see the big differences.

00:30:39.733 --> 00:30:45.533
So here is up to the present
day, this is actual data, and

00:30:45.533 --> 00:30:48.533
here's the constant composition
commitment curve

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:52.767
that you saw beginning to peel
off in the previous one.

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:55.400
While the other ones continued
together, but by the time you

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.033
get to 2050 now, they're
beginning to

00:30:58.033 --> 00:30:59.967
diverge quite strongly.

00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:05.233
And by 2100 they really
are quite different.

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:10.333
I don't want to project how long
each of you will live,

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:14.433
but I expect that a lot of you
in the classroom will be

00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:18.733
around maybe in 2080.

00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:25.400
And so that is the world that
you will probably live to see,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.867
with some variability.

00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:33.233
But I think if the last five
years is any guide, probably

00:31:33.233 --> 00:31:37.967
you'll be up in this upper range
if things continue as

00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:38.767
they are going.

00:31:38.767 --> 00:31:44.300
So that's a warming of about
again this is based on this

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.033
reference, not pre-industrial
but that's a warming of about

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:54.700
3 degrees Celsius from
the current day.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.267
Then they begin to level out.

00:31:56.267 --> 00:32:00.200
All of these scenarios begin
to level out, except for A2

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.800
perhaps, because of
the assumptions

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.000
that have been made.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.033
And in fact by the time we are
removing fossil fuels at a

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:14.600
high rate for the next 100
years, we will have depleted a

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.100
fairly significant fraction
of the fossil fuel.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:23.367
So this turning over is
not all our choice.

00:32:23.367 --> 00:32:26.267
Some of this will turn over
simply because the remaining

00:32:26.267 --> 00:32:28.500
amount of fossil fuels
to be burned is

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.867
getting to be so small.

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.100
Questions on this?

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.733
Again, you'll find this
in the IPCC report.

00:32:39.733 --> 00:32:45.133
Now when you plot the same data
on a larger time frame,

00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:49.400
going back 1000 years,
so here we are today.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.467
So what they've done is taken
that historic proxy data that

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:56.900
I've shown you before, with a
little bit of a hint of a

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.567
medieval warming, and a little
bit of a hint of a little ice

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:04.300
age in here, and then our
current kind of two phased

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:09.200
warming in the 20th century,
and then put these IPCC

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.400
scenarios tacked on to that,
it helps you to put in

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.900
perspective as to how the
changes relate to what we've

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.867
seen over the last part of
the Holocene period.

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:23.733
It's quite a steep and dramatic
rise compared to the

00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:25.833
flat climate we've
had recently.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.600
Any questions on that?

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.033
Yes.

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:33.300
Student: How about relative to
periods significantly prior to

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.067
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:34.067 --> 00:33:35.000
So that's important.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.567
Now.

00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:37.633
I don't have the diagram here,
but they're loaded in the

00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:40.700
previous presentations.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.300
You can go back and see that.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.567
And of course what will happen
is when you get 10,000 years

00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:49.667
back so here's 1000 years back
when you go 10 times more,

00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:54.933
then you're back into the
Pleistocene, the LGM, the Last

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:57.000
Glacial Maximum, and then
this temperature

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.767
drops about 5 degrees.

00:33:58.767 --> 00:34:04.467
So take that distance and put it
down here and that'll give

00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:05.500
you a different sense.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:05.967
Right?

00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:08.600
That'll give you a sense of
well, OK, this is higher than

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.967
any of that, but as an
absolute change it is

00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:15.700
comparable to what we
had going in and

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.700
out of the ice ages.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.633
It was all down here however,
so this is unique in its

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:24.633
warmth, but not unique in its
magnitude of the fluctuating.

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:25.967
That's a good point
to keep in mind.

00:34:25.967 --> 00:34:30.767
So you can be fooled by just
what period of geologic

00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:36.233
history you've used here to form
a basis for comparison.

00:34:36.233 --> 00:34:37.467
Other questions on this?

00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:43.633
And of course it won't be
uniform, the warming.

00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:48.267
Here's the warmth they
anticipate under three of the

00:34:48.267 --> 00:34:56.767
scenarios, B1, A1, B and A2 up
from 20 to 29, most of the

00:34:56.767 --> 00:34:58.733
warmth is in the northern
hemisphere.

00:34:58.733 --> 00:35:01.933
Up to the end of the century
then, much more warming, but

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.233
again concentrated
in the northern

00:35:05.233 --> 00:35:07.900
hemisphere, high latitudes.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.967
Values as high as 7
degrees Celsius.

00:35:11.967 --> 00:35:15.500
My god, that's a
lot of warming.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.400
That's an amazing amount
of warming.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.200
Certainly there would
be no arctic ice.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.733
Certainly there'd be no glaciers
in the northern

00:35:23.733 --> 00:35:27.467
hemisphere, mountain glaciers,
under that climate.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:37.533
OK, any questions on these
IPCC projections?

00:35:37.533 --> 00:35:37.833
Yes.

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:40.467
Student: What about in
comparison to the Pliocene,

00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:42.300
the period that we said
was comparable--

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.467
PROFESSOR: The Pliocene, right.

00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:47.300
So that would then be comparable
the Pliocene also

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.567
seemed to have much higher
temperatures at the high

00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:53.200
latitudes than we have today.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.900
So this kind of scenario is one
of the reasons why there

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.833
is a lot of research on the
Pliocene, because they need

00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:04.900
too had this kind of warmth in
the northern high latitudes.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.900
And we don't understand why that
is exactly, but it may

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.033
well be something
similar to this.

00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.667
Except that it didn't seem that
the CO2 values were as

00:36:13.667 --> 00:36:17.733
high back then during
the Pliocene.

00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:20.400
But it'd be worth reading a
couple papers on the Pliocene

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.433
to see to what extent they if
you just Google Pliocene

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:32.200
climate, you can quickly
just use a

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.067
Google Scholar for example.

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:38.067
If you want to get the peer
reviewed literature, go into

00:36:38.067 --> 00:36:41.367
Google Scholar and search for
Pliocene climate and you'll

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:43.767
find a lot of recent papers that
are trying to deal with

00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:45.033
just this issue.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:54.133
So a lot of problems then we
perceive could be connected

00:36:54.133 --> 00:36:55.233
with this global warming.

00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:56.867
And these are all
pretty obvious.

00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:58.933
I just list them here.

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:01.767
And it may not be complete.

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:05.000
We expect increasing drought,
which will--

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.100
and some human populations as
well as animal populations

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.367
will be forced to migrate.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.400
They'll be some extinctions
probably.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.633
The one that's most talked about
will be the polar bears.

00:37:22.633 --> 00:37:29.333
My strategy for global warming
is that if I just buy a house

00:37:29.333 --> 00:37:35.233
300 miles north of New Haven,
that'll pretty much account

00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:38.700
for the global warming that'll
take place in my lifetime.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.033
Pretty clever, right?

00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:41.667
A lot of deep thought
went into that.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.700
But imagine the polar
bears, right?

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.200
They live in this arctic
environment.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.933
It's going to warm up.

00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:50.300
They're going to lose the
sea ice very quickly

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.267
from which they hunt.

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:53.600
They aren't going to mind
the warm so much.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.233
They can probably handle that,
but they normally do their

00:37:57.233 --> 00:38:00.133
hunting off the sea ice.

00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:02.667
Without sea ice, they won't
to have a way to eat.

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:06.033
And therefore we're probably
going to lose the polar bear

00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:08.500
pretty quickly.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.000
That ecosystem will be gone.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.767
There will be frequenct
heat waves.

00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:16.667
For example, a few years ago we
had a heat wave in Europe.

00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:19.900
I believe that was in 2003
that killed some tens of

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.267
thousands of people.

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:27.633
And we had one just a year and
a half ago in eastern Europe.

00:38:27.633 --> 00:38:30.567
And the projections are that
these will occur very

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:35.000
frequently as we get towards the
middle and the end of the

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.867
current century.

00:38:36.867 --> 00:38:39.367
And of course, if you're living
up north that's not too

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:41.300
bad, or if you have
air conditioning.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.167
But air conditioning is a
problem because that uses

00:38:43.167 --> 00:38:48.033
energy which may require fossil
fuel burning, which

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.700
would put more CO2 in
the atmosphere.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.500
So that's kind of a
downward spiral.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.833
The ice on land will melt.

00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:59.833
The mountain glaciers we spoke
about, and the ice sheets of

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:02.767
Greenland and Antarctica
we talked about.

00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:07.700
And because that, ice on land is
supported by the land, when

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.433
it melts, that lifts
sea level.

00:39:09.433 --> 00:39:12.767
Remember if ice is already
floating in the ocean and you

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.467
melt it, that doesn't
change sea level.

00:39:15.467 --> 00:39:19.667
But if ice is supported by the
land, as a mountain glacier

00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:23.600
would be, or a large ice sheet
would be, that will cause sea

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.367
level to rise.

00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:29.167
And it could be the order of
several meters, which would

00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:32.767
have a big impact on coastal
development.

00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:43.933
Today many rivers flow all
summer because they get for

00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:46.000
example, in California the
rivers that come down out of

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.233
the Sierra Nevada range, they
do decrease their flow in

00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:51.867
summertime because there's
not much rain.

00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:54.833
But they keep it going because
there's enough glacial ice

00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:57.900
melting through the summer to
provide those rivers with

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.567
water even in July and
August. Well, that

00:40:00.567 --> 00:40:01.633
will certainly change.

00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:03.367
And there's all these
rivers coming

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:04.667
down out of the mountains.

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:09.400
If there's not rain in that
season, those rivers will

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.767
certainly go dry.

00:40:10.767 --> 00:40:14.533
Because without the ice and snow
to store water at high

00:40:14.533 --> 00:40:19.533
altitudes and this will be a big
difference between today.

00:40:19.533 --> 00:40:23.633
Many, many rivers around the
world are flowing in summer

00:40:23.633 --> 00:40:28.467
only because of snow pack
melting, that stores that

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:31.300
water until late summer.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.600
Tropical diseases will
move forward.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.667
And I hesitated to put this in
there but I did, because it's

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:39.967
not likely that would happen,
but it's constantly discussed

00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:42.733
in the literature, in the
scientific literature, as a

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:43.500
possibility.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:49.500
That is, if you look at the
planet Venus with its

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:55.067
unusually warm climate surface
temperature for Venus is 460

00:40:55.067 --> 00:41:00.600
in Celsius, 735 in Kelvin it
has the solar system's

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.533
strongest greenhouse effect, has
a rather high albedo, it

00:41:04.533 --> 00:41:05.733
reflects a lot of sunlight.

00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:09.900
But nevertheless it as a very
high surface temperature

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.633
because of its high
greenhouse effect.

00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:17.800
And the idea is that it probably
wasn't always like

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.967
this, but some kind of process
amplified itself.

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:27.433
Probably it started to warm
up, that for some of this

00:41:27.433 --> 00:41:32.033
carbon that was in the surface
of the planet to come off the

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:34.467
planet and form carbon
dioxide which

00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:36.733
warmed the planet further.

00:41:36.733 --> 00:41:39.633
Water may have played a role
too, but now most of

00:41:39.633 --> 00:41:41.200
the water is gone.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.533
Water may have played a role
in getting Venus to its hot

00:41:44.533 --> 00:41:46.933
state, but most of
that's gone now.

00:41:46.933 --> 00:41:52.400
Anyway, either a water vapor
feedback or a CO2 feedback

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.200
probably took Venus from an
earth-like state to its

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.633
current state.

00:41:58.633 --> 00:42:02.800
And so there is some
worry that this

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.767
could happen to earth.

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:06.833
We could get to some point
where suddenly these two

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:11.700
feedbacks, carbon dioxide and
water vapor feedbacks, might

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.967
then take control of the climate
and run away and give

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:19.967
us something that's much, much
higher than any of these IPCC

00:42:19.967 --> 00:42:20.800
projections.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.100
It's not likely, but you can
read about it in the

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.367
literature.

00:42:29.433 --> 00:42:32.133
There are advantages however.

00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:35.433
There are vast regions in
the northern hemisphere,

00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:39.767
especially Canada and northern
Asia, where agriculture is

00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:44.867
mostly limited by lack
of summer warmth.

00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:49.067
And so you would find greatly
increased agricultural

00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:53.867
productivity in Canada and Asia
under these IPCC global

00:42:53.867 --> 00:42:57.267
warming scenarios.

00:42:57.267 --> 00:43:01.067
Also at the present time, many
more people die from cold

00:43:01.067 --> 00:43:04.767
every year than from warmth.

00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:07.600
And of course, my heating
bill will be less,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.000
so I'd enjoy that.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.967
And it's now known and well
documented in the literature

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:22.300
that when CO2 concentrations
rise, plants grow more quickly

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.600
because it of what's called
CO2 fertilization.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.633
And so crops will grow generally
more quickly.

00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:33.600
Some would argue that the
crop--the nature of the plant

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.467
structure however changes and
makes that plant material less

00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:40.233
nutritious.

00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:41.100
So be careful.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.433
It's not only the mass of the
plant that you grow, but

00:43:44.433 --> 00:43:46.367
weather--if you're going to eat
it, whether or not it's

00:43:46.367 --> 00:43:47.600
nutritious for humans.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.233
So be a little bit careful
on that one.

00:43:49.233 --> 00:43:53.633
But there's no doubt that CO2
fertilization is already being

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:56.767
seen in forests and
in agriculture.

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:59.633
So that's a real factor,
a real positive factor.

00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:07.333
So these again are
pretty obvious.

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:10.567
If we wanted to reduce global
warming what would we do?

00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.233
Well none of these are easy.

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.200
Many of these are impossible.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.900
But I list them anyway, being
the eternal optimist. Reduce

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:25.567
human populations, reduce per
capita use of energy.

00:44:25.567 --> 00:44:29.467
One way to do that would be to
increase energy costs so that

00:44:29.467 --> 00:44:32.800
each of us would work harder
to reduce our per

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.433
capita use of energy.

00:44:36.433 --> 00:44:40.200
Reforest the continents, because
when you grow a tree,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.333
you sequester a certain amount
of carbon dioxide.

00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:45.267
There are a couple of
problems with that.

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:47.467
I've mentioned one
of them already.

00:44:47.467 --> 00:44:52.700
A tree typically only lives 60
or 100 years and then it will

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.133
die and that carbon dioxide
will be returned.

00:44:57.133 --> 00:45:00.200
Within 20 years, it'll be
back in the atmosphere.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.633
So it's not a permanent way
to store carbon dioxide.

00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:07.600
And also recently in the
literature, it's been pointed

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.467
out, and it's really quite
obvious when you think about

00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:15.200
it, forests are very dark
in their coloration.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.800
Their albedo is very low.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:22.467
And so if you add more forest,
you decrease the average

00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:26.800
albedo of the planet, which
would warm the planet.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.133
So be careful about
that trade off.

00:45:32.867 --> 00:45:35.167
Fertilize the oceans.

00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:38.967
For a while we were talking
about putting iron into the

00:45:38.967 --> 00:45:42.000
oceans, because that turned out
to be a limiting nutrient

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.367
for phytoplankton growth.

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:50.500
And phytoplankton draw in CO2
just like plants on land do.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.467
The question once again though,
how long would it stay

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:53.700
in the oceans?

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.500
Would it fall to the bottom to
be covered over, or would it

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:01.000
just return back into
the atmosphere.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.833
Stop third world economic
growth.

00:46:03.833 --> 00:46:07.467
Well that's kind of a joke,
because how in the world would

00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:09.000
you do that?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.400
Of course in the first world
we use much more carbon

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.000
dioxide, we emit much more
carbon dioxide per capita than

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.500
the third world does.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.767
And that's because we have a
higher standard of living and

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:27.100
the third world aspire to have
the same standard of living

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.500
that we do.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.367
And so that's going to be where
a lot of the increasing

00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:34.233
CO2 emissions will come from.

00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:35.467
Shift to nuclear energy.

00:46:35.467 --> 00:46:39.100
Nuclear energy does not emit
any carbon dioxide.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.700
Shift to renewable energies of
various types, wind, solar,

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.467
geothermal.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.900
I'm going to be talking about
these, by the way, in the last

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.800
week of the course.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.667
We're going to talk a bit
about renewable energy.

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:53.767
The big thing that's talked
about these days is CCS,

00:46:53.767 --> 00:46:55.333
Carbon Capture and Storage.

00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:59.267
It's removing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere and

00:46:59.267 --> 00:47:04.500
burying it down deep in the
crust of the earth.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.600
A lot of research is being
funded, including a big grant

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.867
here in the geology department
at Yale to work on some

00:47:10.867 --> 00:47:14.633
aspects of this.

00:47:14.633 --> 00:47:16.833
The question is-- of the
questions is would it stay

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:17.500
down there?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.867
I mean it's light material.

00:47:20.867 --> 00:47:23.567
You'd like to combine it or
condense it in some way that

00:47:23.567 --> 00:47:27.067
it's stable and would stay
down where you put it.

00:47:27.067 --> 00:47:29.767
But after all, it is a material
that would like to

00:47:29.767 --> 00:47:33.000
gasify and come back out.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.333
And so there again I would worry
about how long it would

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:38.800
stay buried down there.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.767
And then various geoengineering
hypotheses have

00:47:42.767 --> 00:47:45.833
been made, such as constructing
some kind of a

00:47:45.833 --> 00:47:52.633
shade over the earth to prevent
some of the sunlight

00:47:52.633 --> 00:47:54.133
from reaching the earth.

00:47:54.133 --> 00:47:56.200
We're out of time.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.767
I've got a few more comments
about this for next Monday,

00:47:58.767 --> 00:48:00.067
but enjoy your weekend.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.329
Professor Steven Smith:
Because it's a makeup class,

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:04.600
we'll do something a little
special.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.620
We're going to show a clip from
a movie that I think is

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.473
particularly appropriate.
As we get into it,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:19.186
I'll tell you why.
It's about a five-minute

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.940
segment from the film called
The Third Man.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.460
Has anyone ever seen it?
Okay, maybe more than I thought.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.521
Just to set up the scene,
for those of you have seen it

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.790
and more for those of you who
haven't,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.740
this is a film that was made in
1948 called The Third Man

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.490
from a Graham Greene short
story.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.670
It takes place in post World
War II Vienna.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.434
And the clip we're going to see
is the most famous part of the

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:52.473
movie.
It takes place of a

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.040
conversation between two old
friends.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.799
One of them,
played by Orson Welles,

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.136
is in a black market racket in
Vienna and is making a living

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:10.400
doing something very bad in the
black market.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.069
In this scene,
he's trying to convince an old

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.821
school friend of his,
played by Joseph Cotten,

00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:22.382
to join this thing.
I should say the Orson Welles

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:27.394
character has also faked his
death, so no one except his

00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:31.860
immediate conspirators knows
he's still alive.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.792
I should have said that.
He's faked his death and here

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:37.425
he has a scene with his old
school friend,

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:41.276
played by Joseph Cotten,
and he's trying to convince him

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:43.870
to come into his black market
racket.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.690
So here comes The Third
Man.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.342
Good scene.
It's good because I think it

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:58.146
conveys something of the flavor
of Machiavelli's thought in

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:02.150
Italy for 30 years under the
Borgias.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.968
This is Machiavelli's time.
Blood shed and murder and

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.830
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renais
sance.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.330
Under Switzerland for 500
years, peace and democracy.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.349
What did it produce?
The cuckoo clock.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.699
I'm going to talk about that in
a moment.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.439
I want to begin by talking
about who was Machiavelli.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.310
How do we read The
Prince?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.815
Machiavelli was a Florentine.
To know that is to know

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:36.639
virtually everything you need to
know about him.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.950
I'm exaggerating but I do so to
make a point.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.660
Florence was a republic.
It was a city-state.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.618
And Machiavelli spent a good
deal of his adult life in the

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:54.431
service of the republic.
Living in Florence,

00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:59.004
the center of the Renaissance
at the height of the Renais

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.490
sance,
Machiavelli wished to do for

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.491
politics what his
contemporaries,

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.180
like Leonardo da Vinci and
Michelangelo,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.404
had done for art and sculpture.
In other words,

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:15.200
he hoped to revive in some way
the spirit of the ancients of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.480
antiquity, but to modify it in
the lights of his own

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.622
experience.
As he puts it in the dedication

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:25.369
of his most famous book,
he writes that this book The

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.525
Prince "is a product of long
experience with modern things

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:33.000
and a continuous reading of the
ancient ones."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.905
In Machiavelli,
we have what we have come to

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:42.082
call "modernity," given its
first and most powerful expres

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:46.562
sion.
But Machiavelli was not an

00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:51.605
ordinary Florentine.
He grew up under the rule of

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.803
the Medici.
That is to say,

00:03:53.803 --> 00:03:58.844
the first family of Florence,
and lived to see them deposed

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:03.189
by a Dominican friar by the name
of Savonarola.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.757
Savonarola attempted to impose
a kind of theocracy in Florence,

00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:14.099
a sort of Christian republic of
virtue.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.950
But the Florentines,
being what they were,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.959
rejected this idea and the rule
of Savonarola was short-lived.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.401
In its place,
a republic was re-established

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.991
where Machiavelli occupied the
office of secretary to the

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:37.122
second chancery,
a kind of diplomatic post which

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:41.629
he held for 14 years from 1498
to 1512.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.759
After the fall of the republic
and the return of the Medici to

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.051
princely rule there,
Machiavelli was exiled from the

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:55.857
city, from politics to a small
estate that he owned on the out

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:58.910
skirts of the city.
You can visit it today.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.585
It was here,
from a place of political

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:07.949
exile, that he wrote his major
works--The Prince,

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.713
 the Discourses on
Livy, and The Art of

00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:16.566
War. It was from here,
also, that he wrote voluminous

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:21.560
letters to friends seeking
knowledge about politics.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.470
Machiavelli was a kind of
political junkie,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.380
you could say,
in things happening in Italy

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.904
and else where.
In one of these letters,

00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:37.290
a famous letter to his friend,
a man named Francesco Vettori,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.529
he describes how he came to
write his most famous book.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.790
I want to read a passage from
that letter.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.930
It is also, I should say,
on the basis of this letter,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.460
which is why I ask people from
time to time to remove their

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.519
caps in the class room,
from the House of Study.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:58.709
This is the way Machiavelli
approached study.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:01.979
"When evening comes,"--he
writes, "When evening comes,

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.569
I return to my house and go to
my study.

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.532
At the door,
I take off my clothes of the

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:11.604
day covered with muck and dirt
and I put on my regal and

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:14.897
courtly garments.
And decently reclothed,

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:19.355
I enter the ancient courts of
ancient men, where received by

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:23.357
them lovingly,
I feed on the food that alone

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:28.314
is mine and that I was born for.
There I am not ashamed to speak

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:31.803
with them and to ask them the
reasons for their actions and

00:06:31.803 --> 00:06:34.209
they, in their humanity,
reply to me.

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:38.630
And for the space of four hours
every night, I feel no boredom.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.722
I forget every pain.
I do not fear poverty and death

00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:47.308
does not frighten me.
I deliver myself entirely unto

00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:49.602
them.
And because Dante says that to

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:52.212
have understood without
retention does not make

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.560
knowledge,
I have noted what capital I

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.602
have made from their
conversations and have composed

00:06:57.602 --> 00:07:01.910
a little work on principalities,
where I delve as deeply as I

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.033
can into reflections on this
subject, debating what a

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:09.548
principality is,
of what kinds they are,

00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:13.566
how they are acquired,
how they are maintained,

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:18.449
and why they are lost.
So there, Machiavelli gives us

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:24.120
a sense of the seriousness with
which he approached his subject,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.810
how he studied,
and what it was he came to

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.697
write.
Let me just say from the

00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:34.649
beginning, The Prince is
a deceptive book.

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:40.779
What else would we expect from
the name of a man that has

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.610
become synonymous with
deception?

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.212
It is a work,
The Prince,

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:52.080
that everybody has heard of,
perhaps has some preconception

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.414
about.
I was checking the web

00:07:54.414 --> 00:07:57.811
yesterday and I found a new book
about Machiavelli,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:01.139
which none of these every fail
to surprise me.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:07.856
This one is called The Suit:
a Machiavellian Guide to Men's

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:12.509
Fashion. Check it out.
Who knows?

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:14.670
Machiavelli's name is
everywhere.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.927
It is applied to everything,
from corporate executives now

00:08:19.927 --> 00:08:24.374
to men's fashion.
Everybody knows or thinks they

00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:28.339
know what his work is about.
His name, again,

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:32.419
is synonymous with deception,
treachery, cunning,

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.570
deceit.
Just look at the cover of your

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.440
book.
Look at his face.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.220
Look at his smile,
really more of a smirk.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.489
He seems to be saying,
"I know something you don't

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:51.995
know."
The difficulty with reading

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:57.974
Machiavelli today is that we all
think we already know what he

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:04.019
knows and that is false.
Machiavelli was a revolutionary.

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:08.133
In the preface to his largest
book, the Discourses on

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:12.621
Livy, he compares himself to
Christopher Columbus for his

00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:16.659
discovery of what he calls "new
modes and orders."

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:21.278
What Columbus had done for
geography, Machiavelli claims he

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:24.315
will do for politics.
That is to say,

00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:28.093
discover an entirely new
continent, a new world,

00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:31.710
so to speak,
the new world of Machiavelli.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.797
Machiavelli's new world,
his new modes and orders,

00:09:35.797 --> 00:09:39.383
will require,
clearly, a displacement of the

00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:42.470
earlier one, of the previous
one.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.139
And Machiavelli wrote,
of course, the dominant form of

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:51.897
political organization was the
empire or, to speak more

00:09:51.897 --> 00:09:56.901
precisely, the Christian empire.
The Holy Roman Empire,

00:09:56.901 --> 00:10:01.895
as it was known in the time of
Machiavelli, was the successor

00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:06.389
to the ancient Roman state,
the older Roman Empire.

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:10.297
Both of these empires had
aspired to a kind of

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:13.752
universality.
And this universality was given

00:10:13.752 --> 00:10:17.919
expression in Dante's famous
treatise, De Monarchia,

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:21.253
of monarchy,
that set out a model for a

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:26.165
universal Christian state,
based on the unity and oneness

00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:30.200
of the human race under a
Christian ruler.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.194
Machiavelli rejected this idea
of the empire and harked back,

00:10:36.194 --> 00:10:40.490
instead, to the model of
republican Rome.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.576
And there is much in his
writing that recalls the sort of

00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:48.517
extraordinary virtues and
capacities of the citizens of

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:51.289
the ancient republican
city-state.

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:54.735
But you might say just as
Machiavelli broke with the

00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:57.639
dominant model of Christian
universalism,

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:03.331
so too did he reject the
ancient model of the small,

00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:08.799
autonomous republican state.
He makes this clear in a famous

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:12.970
passage at the beginning of
chapter 15 of The Prince.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.139
And I just want to read that
passage, as well.

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.024
Here, Machiavelli says,
"I depart from the orders of

00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:22.951
others.
I depart from their modes," he

00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.106
says.
"But since it is my intent to

00:11:25.106 --> 00:11:28.049
write something useful to
whoever understands it,

00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:31.369
it has appeared to me more
fitting to go directly to the

00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:34.870
effectual truth of things than
to the imagination of it.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.389
And many have imagined," --one
thinks here of Plato,

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:41.424
perhaps, but also to
Christianity--"Many have

00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:45.013
imagined republics and
principalities that have never

00:11:45.013 --> 00:11:47.980
been seen or known to exist in
truth.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.340
For it is far from how one
lives to how one should live.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.706
That he who lets go of what is
done for what should be done

00:11:56.706 --> 00:12:00.320
learns his ruin rather than his
preservation."

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.640
In other words,
no Platonic cities in speech.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.870
No Augustinian cities of God.
We will only look,

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.929
he says, to the effectual truth
of things.

00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:17.783
The effectual truth of the
matter, not the imagination of

00:12:17.783 --> 00:12:21.977
it or the utopia of it.
That passage is often taken to

00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:26.167
be, the beginning of chapter 15,
the essence of Machiavelli and

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.668
realism, a kind of
Realpolitik,

00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:31.422
as it were.
His appeal from the "ought" to

00:12:31.422 --> 00:12:34.935
the "is," to take one's bearings
again, from the effectual truth

00:12:34.935 --> 00:12:37.136
of things.
This seems to be,

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:40.870
in many ways,
the essence of his teaching.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.352
To be sure, Machiavelli focuses
on key aspects of political

00:12:45.352 --> 00:12:49.757
reality which are often ignored
by thinkers like Plato and

00:12:49.757 --> 00:12:52.485
Aristotle.
Murders, conspiracies,

00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:55.627
coup d'état,
these are the kinds of

00:12:55.627 --> 00:12:58.620
political phenomena he is
interested.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.301
He seems to be more interested
in the evils that human beings

00:13:03.301 --> 00:13:06.500
do than the goods to which they
aspire.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.168
You might even say that
Machiavelli takes delight in

00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:12.830
demonstrating,
much to our chagrin,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:18.933
the space between our lofty
intentions and the actual

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:24.168
consequences of our deeds.
Yet, it would seem to me there

00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:27.741
is more to Machiavelli than the
term "realism" connotes,

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:30.340
although that is certainly
important.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.304
In this passage,
Machiavelli announces his

00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:40.395
break, indeed his repudiation of
all those who have come before,

00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:45.755
all those who have come before.
He both replaces and yet

00:13:45.755 --> 00:13:50.611
reconfigures according to his
own lights, elements from both

00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:54.480
the Christian empire and the
Roman republic,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.373
to create a new form of
political organization

00:13:58.373 --> 00:14:02.570
distinctly his own.
What we might call today the

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.744
modern state.
Machiavelli is the founder,

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:08.758
the discoverer,
the inventor of the modern

00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:09.420
state.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.787
This modern,
secular, sovereign state was

00:14:16.787 --> 00:14:21.320
refined and developed in the
decades and centuries after

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.700
Machiavelli in the writing of
Hobbes,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.696
of Locke, of Rousseau,
to say nothing of contemporary

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:33.461
twentieth-century writers from
both the right and the left--Max

00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.313
Weber,
Karl Schmidt,

00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:39.062
to a man, an Italian
philosopher named Antonio

00:14:39.062 --> 00:14:44.393
Gramsci, who was the author of a
book interestingly called The

00:14:44.393 --> 00:14:48.899
Modern Prince,
based on Machiavelli himself.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:52.737
Machiavelli's state itself has
universalist ambitions,

00:14:52.737 --> 00:14:55.634
in many ways,
much like its Christian and

00:14:55.634 --> 00:14:59.035
Roman predecessors.
But this is a state,

00:14:59.035 --> 00:15:02.681
he believes,
that has now been liberated or

00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:08.409
emancipated from Christian and
classical conceptions of virtue.

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:12.421
The management of affairs is
left to those people who he

00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:15.339
calls princes,
which in the Machiavellian

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:19.497
usage designates a new kind of
political founder or leader

00:15:19.497 --> 00:15:22.779
endowed with a new species of
ambition,

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:26.097
love of glory,
and elements of prophetic

00:15:26.097 --> 00:15:29.500
authority that we might call
charisma.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.762
But just what was the nature of
the revolution contemplated by

00:15:38.762 --> 00:15:43.759
our founder, Machiavelli,
the founder of modern political

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:46.972
science?
Consider, just for a moment,

00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:49.879
the title and dedication of the
book.

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:52.916
The Prince appears,
on its surface,

00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:57.379
to be a most conventional work.
It presents itself in the long

00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:01.620
tradition of what has come to be
called the mirror of princes.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.929
Books that give a kind of guide
to the dos and don'ts of

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:09.909
princely behavior.
Fair enough.

00:16:09.909 --> 00:16:15.039
It seems to go back a long,
long time.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:19.452
And the appearance of
conventionality is supported by

00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:24.289
the opening words of the book in
his dedicatory letter.

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:29.312
The first words or first line
out of his mouth or the first

00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:32.690
lines are "it is customary," he
says.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.137
It is a work intended to
ingratiate himself to Lorenzo de

00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:40.950
Medici, the man to whom the work
is dedicated,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.285
a customary prince,
a traditional prince who has

00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:48.000
just regained his power.
But look again.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.789
Consider the structure of the
first three chapters.

00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:55.942
"All states,
all dominions that have held

00:16:55.942 --> 00:16:59.883
and do hold empire over man are
either republics or

00:16:59.883 --> 00:17:04.284
principalities,"
he says in the opening sentence

00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:07.330
of chapter 1.
Having distinguished two,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.454
and only two,
kinds of regimes,

00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:13.025
republics and principalities,
as the only ones worth

00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:15.932
mentioning, he goes on to
distinguish two kinds of

00:17:15.932 --> 00:17:18.901
principalities.
There are hereditary

00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:22.894
principalities,
like those currently run by

00:17:22.894 --> 00:17:28.503
Lorenzo, which acquire their
authority through tradition and

00:17:28.503 --> 00:17:33.154
hereditary bloodlines.
Then he says there are new

00:17:33.154 --> 00:17:38.120
princes and new principalities.
Machiavelli then asserts that

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.679
his book will deal only with
principalities,

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.989
leaving,
he says, the discussion of

00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:46.358
republics for elsewhere,
what one assumes his

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:49.462
Discourses of Livy,
which he was already writing by

00:17:49.462 --> 00:17:52.749
this time.
But then Machiavelli goes on to

00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:57.522
tell the reader that the
exclusive subject of this book

00:17:57.522 --> 00:18:01.046
will be the new prince.
In other words,

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:05.054
not Lorenzo at all,
but precisely princes who have

00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:09.880
or will achieve their authority
through their own guile,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.969
their own force,
or their own virtù,

00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:17.351
to use the famous Machiavellian
term that I want to talk about

00:18:17.351 --> 00:18:19.861
later.
The true, in other words,

00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.803
recipient of this book must be
necessarily the potential

00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:25.733
prince.
That is to say,

00:18:25.733 --> 00:18:29.859
someone with sufficient
political audacity to create

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:34.041
their own authority,
who has not simply received it

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:36.904
from the past,
but to create their own

00:18:36.904 --> 00:18:39.475
authority.
Maybe one could even say

00:18:39.475 --> 00:18:42.671
Machiavelli's prince is,
in a way, the first truly

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:43.780
self-made man.

00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:50.213
So what, then,
is the character of this new

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:55.046
prince and how does he differ
from more conventional modes of

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:58.821
political authority?
In one of the most famous

00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:01.841
chapters of the book,
chapter 6, entitled,

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:06.407
"Of New Principalities that are
Acquired Through One's Own Arms

00:19:06.407 --> 00:19:09.413
and Virtue,"
there is that word again,

00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:12.220
virtù,
one's own arms and virtue,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.430
Machiavelli discusses the
character of the modern prince,

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.876
the new prince.
"A prudent man," he writes,

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:25.295
"should always enter upon the
paths beaten by great men and

00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:28.799
imitate those who have been most
excellent,

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:32.743
so that if his own virtue does
not reach that far,

00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:35.640
it at least is in the odor of
it."

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.907
We at least come within,
you might say,

00:19:38.907 --> 00:19:42.259
sniffing distance of their
greatness.

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:44.673
"One should do," he says,
"what archers do when

00:19:44.673 --> 00:19:46.720
attempting to reach a distant
target,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.388
namely, aim your bow high,
knowing that the force of

00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:53.049
gravity will bring the arrow
down."

00:19:53.049 --> 00:19:55.339
In other words,
set your sights high,

00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:57.819
knowing you will probably fall
short.

00:19:57.819 --> 00:20:00.905
"So who are the greatest
examples," he says,

00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:05.067
"of princely rule that the
prudent man"--interesting choice

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:08.997
of words,
"the prudent man"--"should

00:20:08.997 --> 00:20:13.124
imitate?"
And here, Machiavelli gives a

00:20:13.124 --> 00:20:19.072
list of those heroic founders of
peoples and states--Moses,

00:20:19.072 --> 00:20:22.970
Cyrus, Romulus,
Theseus, and so on.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.983
"As one examines their actions
and lives," he writes,

00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:31.768
"one does not see that they had
anything else from fortune than

00:20:31.768 --> 00:20:36.244
the opportunity which gave them
the matter enabling them to

00:20:36.244 --> 00:20:40.578
introduce any form they please.
Notice in that sentence,

00:20:40.578 --> 00:20:44.089
he uses those Aristotelian
terms, "form" and "matter" that

00:20:44.089 --> 00:20:47.599
we spoke about in relation to
the Aristotelian regime.

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:50.411
"They had nothing else from
fortune," he says,

00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:53.564
again, "than the opportunity,"
the occasion,

00:20:53.564 --> 00:20:58.535
that "gave them the matter
enabling them to introduce any

00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:02.562
form they please."
In short, Machiavelli claims

00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:07.119
these were founders who created,
in a way, ex nihilo,

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:11.490
out of nothing.
They only had the occasion in a

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.681
kind of formless matter upon
which they could adopt and

00:21:16.681 --> 00:21:20.359
impose any form they took.
And they had,

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:24.122
of course, the strength of
mind, as well as the audacity

00:21:24.122 --> 00:21:27.680
and cunning, to take advantage
of this situation.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.885
Such opportunities,
he writes, such occasions,

00:21:30.885 --> 00:21:34.332
made these men successful.
And their excellent virtue

00:21:34.332 --> 00:21:36.680
enabled the opportunity to be
recognized.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.416
Hence, their fatherlands were
ennobled by it and they became

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:41.240
prosperous.

00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:48.664
They took advantage of their
opportunity, seized their

00:21:48.664 --> 00:21:52.210
opportunity and imposed their
own form upon it.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.349
And it is here that Machiavelli
introduces his famous

00:21:56.349 --> 00:22:00.250
distinction between armed and
unarmed prophets.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.625
"All the armed prophets," he
says, "conquered and the unarmed

00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:08.890
were ruined."
This seems to be and is,

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.529
clearly, a kind of classic
statement of sheer Machiavellian

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:17.627
power politics.
"All politics grows out of the

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:22.941
barrel of a gun," as a famous
twentieth-century Machiavellian

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:27.192
once put it.
The armed prophets conquer,

00:22:27.192 --> 00:22:31.810
the unarmed lose.
But there seems to be more to

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.511
it than this.
Machiavelli compares the prince

00:22:35.511 --> 00:22:38.280
to a prophet.
Why does he use that language?

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.506
What is a prophet?
The most obvious answer is a

00:22:43.506 --> 00:22:49.106
person to whom God speaks.
Machiavelli's armed prophets

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:54.198
may not be religious figures and
they are not necessarily

00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:58.638
recipients of divine knowledge,
but they seem to be,

00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:02.280
at least on his account,
people of exceptional personal

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.180
qualities that allow them to
bring laws,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.417
to be law bringers,
lawgivers, shapers of

00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:15.560
institutions and also reformers
of opinions that govern our

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.030
lives.
Machiavelli's armed prophet is

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.769
more than just a gangster,
like Orson Welles in that part.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:29.309
He is a teacher and a kind of
educator as well.

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:33.526
You might even think in your
class, in your sections,

00:23:33.526 --> 00:23:37.661
how or in what ways does
Machiavelli's armed prophet

00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:42.849
differ in important ways both
from Plato's philosopher king,

00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:47.470
as well as Aristotle's notion
of the megalopsychos as

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.289
the sort of magnanimous
statesman.

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:54.909
Although this kind of talk
about "armed prophets always

00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:59.700
win" is characteristic of
Machiavelli, he likes this kind

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.352
of tough talk.
He clearly recognizes that

00:24:03.352 --> 00:24:08.310
there are clear exceptions to
his rule about armed prophets.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.210
Who comes to mind most vividly?
Who, in other words,

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:18.728
is not present in Machiavelli's
list of great prophets that one

00:24:18.728 --> 00:24:21.849
should imitate?
Student: Jesus.

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:22.670
Professor Steven Smith:
Yes.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.086
Most obvious,
perhaps, certainly to his

00:24:26.086 --> 00:24:29.952
contemporaries,
Jesus, who triumphed through

00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:34.070
words and teaching alone.
He had no troops.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.981
He had no arms.
He established a religion,

00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:38.852
first a sect,
you might say,

00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:42.039
then a religion,
then eventually an empire,

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:44.771
the Holy Roman Empire,
that was established in the

00:24:44.771 --> 00:24:49.209
name of that teaching.
Words may well be a powerful

00:24:49.209 --> 00:24:54.741
weapon, as powerful as a gun.
Then you might say,

00:24:54.741 --> 00:25:00.326
"What is Machiavelli himself?"
Who is Machiavelli but an

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:03.950
archetypal, unarmed prophet?
He has no troops.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.299
He has no territory.
He controls no real estate.

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:10.794
He's been banished,
yet he is clearly attempting to

00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:13.660
conquer, comparing himself to
Columbus,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.311
to conquer in large part
through the transformation of

00:25:17.311 --> 00:25:19.860
our understanding of good and
evil,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.383
of virtue and vice.
In other words,

00:25:23.383 --> 00:25:27.746
to make people obey you,
you must first make them

00:25:27.746 --> 00:25:31.609
believe you.
Machiavelli's prophetic prince,

00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:35.317
in other words,
must have some of the qualities

00:25:35.317 --> 00:25:39.930
of a philosopher,
as well as a religious reformer

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.190
trying to reshape and remold
human opinion,

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:49.057
especially opinion over,
as we said, good and evil,

00:25:49.057 --> 00:25:53.047
just and unjust.
What does this reformation,

00:25:53.047 --> 00:25:56.609
so to speak,
or transformation consist of?

00:25:56.609 --> 00:26:00.254
We might even call this
Machiavelli in the garden of

00:26:00.254 --> 00:26:03.397
good and evil,
midnight in the garden of good

00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:05.470
and evil for Machiavelli.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:19.467
One point often attributed
about Machiavelli is that he

00:26:19.467 --> 00:26:27.390
introduced a new kind of
immoralism into politics.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:32.517
In that famous chapter,
chapter 15, he says he sets out

00:26:32.517 --> 00:26:36.410
to teach the prince how not to
be good.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.362
A striking formulation.
He will teach the prince how

00:26:40.362 --> 00:26:43.794
not to be good.
And in perhaps the most

00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:47.930
important book on Machiavelli
ever written,

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.952
the author of that book
declared Machiavelli to be a

00:26:52.952 --> 00:26:55.881
teacher of evil.
You might want to think about

00:26:55.881 --> 00:26:57.160
that.
A teacher of evil.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.574
Is that what Machiavelli was?
Questions of good and bad,

00:27:00.574 --> 00:27:04.474
virtue and vice,
appear on virtually every page

00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:08.626
of The Prince.
He is not simply a teacher of

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:12.274
political pragmatism,
of how to adjust means to fit

00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:15.563
the ends.
He seems to be offering nothing

00:27:15.563 --> 00:27:19.690
short of a comprehensive
revolution, transformation.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.451
If you want to use the
Nietzschean language,

00:27:23.451 --> 00:27:28.612
"transvaluation" of our most
basic vocabulary about good and

00:27:28.612 --> 00:27:31.656
evil.
Machiavelli doesn't reject the

00:27:31.656 --> 00:27:36.569
idea of the good.
Rather, he redefines it.

00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:40.273
He is continually speaking,
and in fact I would suggest on

00:27:40.273 --> 00:27:44.105
virtually every page of the
book, he is continually speaking

00:27:44.105 --> 00:27:48.273
the language of virtue.
His word "virtù," which a word

00:27:48.273 --> 00:27:52.009
that retains the Latin word for
the word "man,"

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:55.603
vir, wir,
man, and virtù,

00:27:55.603 --> 00:27:59.040
a word that is perhaps best
translated or,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.196
by our word, "manliness."
What distinguishes

00:28:04.196 --> 00:28:08.860
Machiavelli's use of this
language of virtù,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.409
manliness,
is that he seeks to locate it

00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:17.289
in certain extreme situations,
such as political foundings,

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:22.107
changes of regimes,
wars, both of domestic and

00:28:22.107 --> 00:28:26.003
foreign kinds.
What distinguishes Machiavelli

00:28:26.003 --> 00:28:28.550
from his predecessors,
in many ways,

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.480
is his attempt to take the
extraordinary situation,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.576
the extreme situation,
again, the extremes of

00:28:35.576 --> 00:28:38.039
political founding,
conspiracies,

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:43.065
wars, coups,
as the normal situation and

00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:48.089
then makes morality fit that
extreme.

00:28:48.089 --> 00:28:52.471
His examples are typically
drawn from situations of human

00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:56.853
beings or polities in extremes
where the very survival or

00:28:56.853 --> 00:29:00.140
independence of a society is at
stake.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.881
In those situations,
you might say,

00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:07.476
and only in those situations,
is it permissible to violate

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:10.539
the precepts of ordinary
morality.

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:14.006
In those situations one must
learn, as he says,

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:17.096
how not to be good,
to have to violate the

00:29:17.096 --> 00:29:20.789
conventions and cannons of
ordinary morality.

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:25.729
Machiavelli takes his bearings
from these extreme states of

00:29:25.729 --> 00:29:30.483
emergency and in his own way,
seeks to normalize them,

00:29:30.483 --> 00:29:35.150
to present them as the normal
condition of politics.

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:42.666
Machiavelli's preference for
these extreme situations

00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:47.450
expresses his belief that only
in moments of great crisis,

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:51.172
where the very existence of a
state is at risk,

00:29:51.172 --> 00:29:54.410
does human nature truly reveal
itself.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:59.272
We finally or fully understand
what people are only in the most

00:29:59.272 --> 00:30:02.618
extreme situations.
The paradox that,

00:30:02.618 --> 00:30:06.216
you might say,
runs throughout all of

00:30:06.216 --> 00:30:12.211
Machiavelli's morality is that
the very possibility of virtue

00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:16.725
grows out of and,
in fact, is even dependent upon

00:30:16.725 --> 00:30:20.311
the context of chaos,
violence, and disorder that

00:30:20.311 --> 00:30:23.300
always threatens the political
world.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.657
Think of it.
Think of many of our great

00:30:26.657 --> 00:30:30.601
political models or heroes.
What would the Duke of

00:30:30.601 --> 00:30:33.380
Marlborough have been without
Louis XIV?

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.430
What would Washington have been
without George III?

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.269
What would Lincoln have been
without the slave interest?

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:44.180
What would Churchill have been
without Hitler?

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.636
In other words,
his point is that good is only

00:30:47.636 --> 00:30:51.400
possible because of the prior
existence of bad.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.333
Good is founded upon evil.
And even the greatest goods,

00:30:56.333 --> 00:31:01.269
the founding and preservation
of cities, often require murder.

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:06.882
What was Romulus' murder of
Remus or Cain's murder of Abel,

00:31:06.882 --> 00:31:10.559
but the kind of murder that
founded,

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:15.369
at the basis of the founding of
cities and civilizations?

00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:19.452
One thinks, in a way,
of Welles' line in The Third

00:31:19.452 --> 00:31:23.299
Man when he looks down from
above and says,

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:27.917
"If I gave you 20,000 pounds
for every dot that stopped

00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:32.450
moving, would you really tell me
to keep my money?"

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.902
It requires,
for Machiavelli,

00:31:34.902 --> 00:31:39.543
the founding of regimes
requires that kind of cold and

00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:41.470
cruel calculation.

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:47.568
Of course, it's being used in
the movie just to support a

00:31:47.568 --> 00:31:50.049
criminal enterprise,
not the founding of a city.

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:54.140
We might investigate that as
well.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.724
But Machiavelli does not deny
that in ordinary terms,

00:31:57.724 --> 00:32:00.894
in what we might call times of
normal politics,

00:32:00.894 --> 00:32:03.789
the ordinary rules of justice
prevail.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:06.718
He also shows,
however, that normal politics

00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:10.259
is, itself, dependent upon
extraordinary politics,

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:13.177
periods of crisis,
anarchy, instability,

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:17.890
revolution, where the normal
rules of the game are suspended.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.293
It is in these times,
you might say,

00:32:20.293 --> 00:32:23.247
when individuals of
extraordinary virtue and

00:32:23.247 --> 00:32:26.013
capacity,
prophetic qualities,

00:32:26.013 --> 00:32:31.259
as he calls it in chapter 6,
are most likely to emerge.

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:34.659
While the Aristotelian
statesmen, just to make a

00:32:34.659 --> 00:32:37.914
contrast for a moment,
is most likely to value

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:41.819
stability and the means
necessary to achieving it,

00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:46.188
the Machiavellian prince seeks
war, because it is only,

00:32:46.188 --> 00:32:50.800
again, in the most extreme
situations that one can prosper

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.740
and be prosperous.
Think about the lines again

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.490
from the movie.
"For 30 years under the

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:02.033
Borgias, violence,
murder, terror,

00:33:02.033 --> 00:33:05.150
bloodshed.
But what did it produce?

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.970
Greatness of an unprecedented
type.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.946
Stability, democracy,
brotherly love,

00:33:11.946 --> 00:33:14.320
peace.
What does that produce?

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:21.033
Mediocrity, the cuckoo clock."
There might be a little more of

00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:24.537
Nietzsche suggested in that,
than Machiavelli,

00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:29.210
but I think the Machiavellian
overtones are very evident.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:33.002
Consider just the following.
Every child,

00:33:33.002 --> 00:33:36.966
every one of you,
every one of us was brought up

00:33:36.966 --> 00:33:42.195
to know that one must never do
wrong, even if good consequences

00:33:42.195 --> 00:33:46.495
are seen to follow.
It is never right to give bad

00:33:46.495 --> 00:33:50.104
examples to others,
even if one expects good to

00:33:50.104 --> 00:33:53.592
come from it.
Yet, Machiavelli breaks these

00:33:53.592 --> 00:33:56.440
rules about not giving bad
examples.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.859
Virtue is not associated with
the classical conceptions of

00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:03.354
moderation, of justice,
of self-control over the

00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:07.259
Christian virtues of faith,
hope, and charity.

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:12.245
Virtue means for him a kind of
manly self-assertion,

00:34:12.245 --> 00:34:17.700
audacity, ruthlessness,
a reliance on one's own arms

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.400
and calculated use of cruelty to
achieve one's ends.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:29.672
The model of Machiavellian
virtù is the Renaissance

00:34:29.672 --> 00:34:33.889
statesman, in general,
Cesare Borgia.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.296
It's very interesting that
Orson Welles made a movie,

00:34:38.296 --> 00:34:42.280
not so often seen today,
about Cesare Borgia.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.826
I want to leave you with
reading one passage from The

00:34:46.826 --> 00:34:50.812
Prince, chapter 7,
in which Machiavelli

00:34:50.812 --> 00:34:56.321
illustrates the kind of
virtù Cesare represented

00:34:56.321 --> 00:35:02.230
and that he wants to recommend
for those who follow him.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.178
"Once the duke," that's Cesare
himself--"Once the duke had

00:35:06.178 --> 00:35:10.223
taken over the Romana,"
an area outside of Florence,

00:35:10.223 --> 00:35:15.262
"he found it had been commanded
by impotent lords who had been

00:35:15.262 --> 00:35:19.640
readier to despoil their
subjects than to correct them

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.605
and had given their subjects
matter for disunion,

00:35:23.605 --> 00:35:27.322
not union.
So Cesare put there," he says

00:35:27.322 --> 00:35:31.388
"Messer Ramiro d'Orco,
a cruel and ready man to whom

00:35:31.388 --> 00:35:35.433
he gave the fullest power."
So Cesare set up as a

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:39.923
lieutenant of his to impose
order on this area and to whom

00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:43.309
he delegated the fullest
responsibility.

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:48.217
"In short time," he goes on,
"Ramiro reduced it to peace and

00:35:48.217 --> 00:35:52.710
unity with the very greatest
reputation for himself.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.010
Then the duke judged that such
excessive authority was not

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.599
necessary, because he feared it
might become hateful and he set

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:03.073
up a sort of a civil court in
the middle of the province with

00:36:03.073 --> 00:36:06.025
the most excellent president
where each city had its

00:36:06.025 --> 00:36:08.969
advocate.
And because he knew that the

00:36:08.969 --> 00:36:12.469
past rigors had generated some
hatred for Ramiro,

00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:16.683
to purge the spirits of that
people and to gain them entirely

00:36:16.683 --> 00:36:20.686
to himself, he wishes to show
that if any cruelty had been

00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:23.485
committed,
this had not come from him,

00:36:23.485 --> 00:36:26.174
from Cesare,
but from the harsh nature of

00:36:26.174 --> 00:36:29.021
his minister.
And having seized this

00:36:29.021 --> 00:36:32.886
opportunity," that language,
seized the occasion,

00:36:32.886 --> 00:36:37.383
seized this opportunity,
"he had emplaced one morning in

00:36:37.383 --> 00:36:41.206
the piazza in two pieces,
with a piece of wood and a

00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:44.719
bloody knife beside him.
He had him cut in two.

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:47.519
The bloody knife and piece of
wood beside him.

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:51.850
"The ferocity of this
spectacle," Machiavelli

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:58.050
concludes, "left the people at
once satisfied and stupefied."

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.703
That, of course,
is Machiavelli's virtù,

00:37:02.703 --> 00:37:07.357
princely virtue,
what you do to leave the people

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:12.630
satisfied and stupefied.
What we might call today shock

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:18.142
and awe.
Okay, next week we'll continue

00:37:18.142 --> 00:37:19.342
this learned man.

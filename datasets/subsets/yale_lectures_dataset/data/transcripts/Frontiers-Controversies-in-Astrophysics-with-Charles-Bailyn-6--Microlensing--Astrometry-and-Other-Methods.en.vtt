00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.037
Professor Charles
Bailyn: You'll recall that

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:05.215
where we got to last time is
that there are lots of Hot

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:05.740
Jupiters;

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.672
lots of Hot Jupiters.
And the alternative theories

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:17.890
that were presented to explain
the evidence for Hot

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.752
Jupiters--the evidence for Hot
Jupiters comes in this form of

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:25.409
these velocity curves,
where you plot the radial

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.020
velocity versus time of the
star.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.068
And the star goes back and
forth, and you infer from that

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:33.410
that there must be a planet
going around it,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.860
which is pulling the star back
and forth.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.748
And some alternative
explanations were proposed to

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:43.687
explain these kinds of data.
Those alternative explanations

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:46.852
didn't seem to work very well,
and so you have to kind of take

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:49.422
the Hot Jupiters seriously.
Before I go on,

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:52.662
let me mention that,
by now, Hot Jupiters are not

00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:56.510
the only kind of planets that
have been seen this way.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.302
There are also planets in--now
known to have much longer

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:09.526
orbits, up to a few years.
These are harder to see for two

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:10.934
reasons.
First of all,

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.700
it takes you a few years to see
them.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.814
And second of all,
when the orbits get longer,

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:20.106
the velocities that they induce
go down, because things in long

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:22.566
orbits go slowly.
But, nevertheless,

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.140
now we've been able to see a
bunch of things.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.748
Oddly, in many cases,
they turn out to have highly

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:33.040
elliptical orbits,
in some cases.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.819
Not the Hot Jupiters,
not the ones that are close in.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.680
Those all are more or less
circular.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.629
But some of these longer ones
have highly elliptical orbits.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:48.330
That's also very weird in terms
of our theories of planetary

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.905
formation because one of the
things that our theories were

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.730
designed to explain was the fact
that all the major planets in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.870
our own Solar System have orbits
that are close to circular.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.123
It does a very good job of
explaining that and then,

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.186
naturally enough,
has trouble explaining the ones

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.376
we see that are in highly
elliptical orbits--highly

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:12.529
elliptical--yes,
I didn't--highly elliptical

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.442
orbits, in some cases.
And just so you know,

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:19.370
the way you recognize a highly
elliptical orbit is it's not

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.880
sinusoidal anymore.
It's got some other shape.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.615
So, these come in:
periodic but non-sinusoidal

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:34.370
velocity curves.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.819
So, all this is very amusing
and you pile up all these very

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.129
strange kinds of planets,
or what you think are planets.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.298
But there's still sort of the
nagging question of whether

00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:54.467
these radial velocity curves
might be explainable in some

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:57.896
other way.
And it would be awfully nice to

00:02:57.896 --> 00:03:02.362
have evidence of some other kind
for the existence of these

00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:04.289
planets.
This is, you know,

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.392
what happens in science.
You find some kind of fairly

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:10.884
strong evidence for something,
but it would be way stronger if

00:03:10.884 --> 00:03:13.460
you found two different kinds of
evidence.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.873
Different--collected in
different ways or reflecting

00:03:16.873 --> 00:03:21.158
different aspects of what you're
observing that both point in the

00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:24.750
same direction.
And, at a certain point along

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.629
the way, about six years ago or
so, a new kind of evidence for

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.550
the existence of these planets
was discovered.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.001
And the first such case,
which is now a very famous star

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:47.640
for this reason,
was something called HD209458;

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.999
that's the name of the star.
And this was a Hot Jupiter

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.715
system.
So, this is the name of the

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:57.581
star;
Hot Jupiter was discovered in

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.933
the usual way by Doppler
measurements,

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:06.050
by radial velocity
measurements.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.080
And then, something else was
discovered.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.380
So, let me show what they found
in this system.

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:31.310
All right, so let me explain
what's plotted here.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.424
This is the brightness of this
system, not the radial velocity

00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:38.190
this time--the brightness
against time.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.401
And so, here it is on the 9th
of September,

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:45.799
1999.
And somebody is measuring the

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:49.206
brightness of this thing.
And it's set up in units so

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.769
that the average brightness is
1.

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:53.640
And you can see,
these measurements have a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.310
little bit of error in them.
They scatter around.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.883
And then, at a certain point
there's a dip in the brightness

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:03.079
of the star for a few hours;
notice this is in days.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.594
This is a tenth of a day,
so 2.4 hours,

00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:08.585
something like that.
So, for a few hours the

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:12.658
brightness of this thing dips
down to about 98% of its--of the

00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:15.339
brightness it has,
so 2--it loses 2% of its

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.379
brightness for a little while
and then it comes back up.

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.736
And then, interestingly enough,
seven nights later on the night

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:26.250
of the 16th of September,
it did the same thing.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.274
Now, seven nights is an
important number for this

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:32.235
particular system,
because it turns out that the

00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:34.629
orbital period of its Hot
Jupiter,

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.449
which was already known at the
time, is three and a half days.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.980
So, this is exactly two orbits
later.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.487
The exact same dip occurred.
You couldn't see it one orbit

00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:48.407
later because three and a half
days later it's daytime,

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:51.435
and one of the features of
astronomy is that you do it at

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.366
night.
And so you have to wait two

00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:58.259
day--two orbits to see the same
thing again.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.689
So, every orbit--there appears
to be this little dip.

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.383
And what is happening is that
this is a system that's almost

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:10.051
exactly edge-on.
And what's happening is that

00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:13.408
the planet is passing in front
of the star, and once per orbit

00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:15.720
the planet gets in the way of
the star.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.579
The planet's this little thing,
the star's a big thing.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:22.172
And a small amount of the
star's light is obscured by the

00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:24.370
planet.
This is called a transit.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.259
So, let me just write that down.
And then, transits are

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.393
discovered--yeah,
okay, we'll come back to the

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:41.579
overheads in a minute because I
want to show you more plots.

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:46.699
And it's the planet getting in
the way of the starlight.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.751
And what this tells you,
also, is how big the planet is,

00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:52.970
because you've got a little
disc in front of a big disc.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.150
And the amount of light that's
obscured--this 2%--tells you

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.970
what the ratio of the area
projected by the planet,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.762
compared to the area projected
by the entire star,

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.071
is.
So, this gives you an

00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:08.933
additional piece of information.
You already know the mass of

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:11.710
the thing because you've
measured the radial velocity.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.040
Now, we also know its size.
So, this was very interesting.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.974
And it is, as I was saying just
a second ago,

00:07:18.974 --> 00:07:23.042
an entirely different kind of
confirmation of the existence of

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.197
this planet.
So, there's no pulsation going

00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:30.442
on here, because some--you not
only are getting the changes in

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:34.129
velocity of the planet you're
seeing--of the star,

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.435
you're also seeing the light of
the star diminish when the

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:38.421
planet passes in front of it.
And then, so,

00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.179
they decided this was
interesting, and so they did

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:43.945
this same experiment,
except with this Hubble Space

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:46.629
Telescope instead of with some
ground-based telescope.

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:49.576
This is what you see with
Hubble, and you can see why

00:07:49.576 --> 00:07:52.920
Hubble is a better telescope
than the ground-based stuff.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.254
This is exactly the same plot.
This is the average brightness

00:07:57.254 --> 00:08:02.470
of the system outside of the
transit, so this is 1.000.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.180
This is .985 so it's dropped
down 1.5% in brightness.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.732
This is in days and in--this is
a tenth of a day here,

00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:14.339
each of these big ticks is .05
of a day.

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:17.129
And here is the star going
along perfectly normally.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:20.496
And you get better measurements
because you're not distorted by

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:23.099
the atmosphere.
And then, all of a sudden,

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:26.457
the thing drops and it
gets--has this very particular

00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:30.074
shape to the light curve,
to the curve of brightness with

00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:32.031
time.
This shape is perfectly

00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:35.510
explained by the hypothesis that
you're passing an opaque disc

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.091
across the surface of the star.
As the disc touches the star it

00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:45.288
starts to--and gradually more
and more of the disc is over the

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:47.830
star.
You get this steep drop here.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.481
And then, this rounded part
down on the bottom comes about

00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:54.990
because when you look at a star,
the center of the star,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.635
the central portion of the star
looks a little bit brighter than

00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:01.337
the edges because,
if you think about looking at a

00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.072
sphere, if you look at the
center, you're looking right at

00:09:04.072 --> 00:09:05.701
it.
If you're looking at the side,

00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:08.205
you're sort of grazing the edge
and it turns out there is

00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:09.860
something called "limb
darkening,"

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.850
which comes about because of
this.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.985
So, stars, if you look at the
Sun for example,

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:16.879
the edges of the Sun look a
little fainter than the middle.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:20.589
And so, what happens is,
as this disc passes across the

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:23.405
face of the star,
it obscures successively

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:27.389
brighter parts of the star until
you get down to here.

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:30.804
Then, it obscures gradually
fainter parts of the star until

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:34.539
it gets to the edge.
Now, the disc is--as it goes up

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:38.159
here, is passing beyond the edge
of the star.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.386
So, this is exactly the shape
of a light curve you would

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:44.789
predict if you passed an opaque
disc in front of a star.

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:48.840
And it really works out
remarkably well.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.073
In fact, there's a line
underneath these points,

00:09:52.073 --> 00:09:56.340
you can see it off here and off
here, which is a prediction.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.941
And you can't see the line
because it's under the point so

00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:02.266
nicely.
So, this works out incredibly

00:10:02.266 --> 00:10:04.517
well.
This is almost for sure an

00:10:04.517 --> 00:10:09.020
opaque disc, namely the planet,
passing in front of the star.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:22.075
So, transits are
discovered--the dip in light due

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:28.919
to planet passing across the
star.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:32.171
Now, this does not happen in
every Hot Jupiter,

00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:35.070
because you have to be lined up
pretty,

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.048
pretty perfectly in order for
the planet to pass in front of

00:10:39.048 --> 00:10:42.745
the star.
That is to say if--here's you,

00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:46.389
here's an observer,
here's the star.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:52.412
And, if the planet--if the
orbital plane of the planet

00:10:52.412 --> 00:10:57.752
looks like this,
then when the planet's in front

00:10:57.752 --> 00:11:03.286
of the star, it'll be below it.
So, if you think about it,

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:05.920
imagine a planet that's
orbiting like this.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.051
Here's its star.
And it never passes in front of

00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.856
the star, because when it's in
front of the star,

00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:15.005
it's below the star.
Whereas, if it--if it's exactly

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:18.324
edge-on, then once per orbit,
it will pass in front of the

00:11:18.324 --> 00:11:22.985
star.
But, you have to have a very

00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:29.577
precise alignment for that to
take place--so,

00:11:29.577 --> 00:11:35.870
requires a precisely edge-on
alignment.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.065
But, if you have such an
alignment, you know how these

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:44.419
dips ought to line up with the
radial velocity curve.

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:48.569
So, now what you see is,
you measure the brightness of

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:52.250
the star versus time,
and you see these dips.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.541
Here's a dip.
Then one orbit later,

00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:56.559
you get another dip,
and so forth.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:58.879
If you then,
at the same time,

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:01.919
measure the radial
velocity--and again,

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:06.879
this is the radial velocity of
the star--then you know how this

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:09.740
has to take place.
Because here you are.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.245
You're looking at it.
And the moment where the dip

00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:18.610
takes place, the planet's got to
be exactly in front of the star.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.317
That means the planet is at
this point in its orbit,

00:12:21.317 --> 00:12:22.909
going that way,
for example,

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.757
and the star is in this part of
its orbit, going that way--which

00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:30.604
means this--the radial velocity
at the moment the dip occurs has

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:32.879
to be zero.
Because for them to be lined

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:35.697
up, one in front of the other,
they've both got to be going

00:12:35.697 --> 00:12:37.968
sideways.
And shortly before that,

00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:42.261
the star was moving away from
you, because they're moving into

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:45.023
position, like this.
Shortly afterwards,

00:12:45.023 --> 00:12:48.870
the star is coming towards you.
And, remember that positive

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.067
radial velocities are coming
toward--or going away from you,

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:56.340
negative velocities are coming
towards you.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.934
So it used to be--it used to be
going away from you,

00:12:59.934 --> 00:13:02.711
positive.
It's now at zero at the point

00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:06.410
of the dip.
And then it's going to be

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:12.152
coming towards you,
so it has to be that these dips

00:13:12.152 --> 00:13:16.860
take place at that point in the
curve.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.529
And so, here again,
it's got to be like this.

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:24.139
And so, the way this has to
work out is something like this.

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:27.837
So, you can predict what the
radial velocity has to be at the

00:13:27.837 --> 00:13:30.610
particular moment where the
transit occurs.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:36.570
And so this works.
This works for HD--what is it?

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.399
209458.
So this works out.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:45.977
So, now you've got a lot of
evidence that this really is a

00:13:45.977 --> 00:13:48.245
planet.
Not only is it moving the star

00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:50.820
back and forth the way you
expect a planet to do,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.454
it's also passing in front of
that star at exactly the moment

00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:57.179
you expect it to pass in front
of the star,

00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:00.823
and the shape of the dip that
it creates is exactly what you

00:14:00.823 --> 00:14:04.590
would expect if you pass an
opaque disc in front of a star.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.041
So now, you've got a whole
bunch of different kinds of

00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:08.851
evidence.
You can ask,

00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:12.429
"Does this prove it's a
planet?"

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:16.399
And then you get into this
problem with scientific proof.

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:19.519
What does it mean to prove
something in science?

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:23.267
You could probably figure out
some clever way that it's

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:27.212
actually a pulsating star,
which has a star spot on it

00:14:27.212 --> 00:14:31.588
that somehow precisely mimics
exactly the way a planet would

00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:33.793
behave.
Impossible that this

00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:37.669
would--well not--I should be
careful with that word.

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:42.733
Highly improbably that this
would actually occur in real

00:14:42.733 --> 00:14:46.599
life, so I think,
you know--people have the

00:14:46.599 --> 00:14:51.073
feeling that science is truth,
somehow, and that,

00:14:51.073 --> 00:14:54.508
you know, that you can prove
things in science,

00:14:54.508 --> 00:14:56.600
kind of,
to a mathematical certainty.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.281
That actually isn't the case.
The legal standard,

00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:02.457
you know, which you're familiar
from cop shows,

00:15:02.457 --> 00:15:06.600
of beyond a reasonable doubt,
applies in science as well.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.718
And that's actually a more
appropriate standard to use for

00:15:10.718 --> 00:15:13.897
anything, which,
in the law or in the natural

00:15:13.897 --> 00:15:16.698
world,
in which you try and reason by

00:15:16.698 --> 00:15:20.302
induction.
And so I would say that this,

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:25.889
plus this, plus the shape of
the--of the spectral lines,

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:29.472
which we talked about last
time, plus the shape of these

00:15:29.472 --> 00:15:33.509
dips--that's proof way beyond a
reasonable doubt that there's a

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:36.049
planet around this particular
star.

00:15:36.049 --> 00:15:41.390
And that really ended the
conversation.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.535
Yes?
Student: Is it always

00:15:43.535 --> 00:15:45.822
directly edge-on or could there
be a case in which it's

00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:47.135
[inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:49.005
Bailyn: Right.
Student: --sort of like

00:15:49.005 --> 00:15:50.348
a little bit below or a little
bit [inaudible]

00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:51.393
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:15:51.393 --> 00:15:54.364
is it always edge-on?
Well, orbits don't change,

00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:57.740
so for this object it's always
edge-on.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.097
For most objects,
it is not edge-on,

00:16:00.097 --> 00:16:02.860
and so, in fact,
what had happened was,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.426
by the time they discovered
this one, there were a couple of

00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:09.627
dozen of Hot Jupiters known.
None of the rest of them do

00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:12.763
this, because in all the rest of
them, the orbit isn't aligned

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.605
properly,
and so the planet never goes in

00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:19.001
front of the star.
And so, in the vast majority of

00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:22.602
cases, you don't get this.
And so, they only discovered

00:16:22.602 --> 00:16:26.725
this after they'd found so many
of them, that one of them turned

00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:30.389
out to be aligned properly,
you know, just by chance.

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:33.287
Student: Is there--it
possible for an orbit to

00:16:33.287 --> 00:16:36.240
not--never pass in front of the
center of the star?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.164
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.695
What it does is it passes--it's
got to do this,

00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:43.664
it's got to have some moment
where the planet is as far

00:16:43.664 --> 00:16:46.455
towards you as it can be,
and then it turns around and

00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:48.381
comes back.
But for most orbits,

00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:51.670
at that point,
the planet will either be below

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.960
or above the star from your line
of sight.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.160
So, imagine this orbit as the
planet goes--here's a star.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.395
Planet's going around the star.
It reaches its furthest forward

00:17:02.395 --> 00:17:05.869
point, but it's well below the
star from your line of sight.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.760
So, it depends on the angle of
the orbital plane.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.956
Does that make sense?
Student:

00:17:10.956 --> 00:17:13.108
It, it doesn't have to pass
through the center of the star,

00:17:13.108 --> 00:17:14.777
it could pass [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:17:14.777 --> 00:17:16.078
Bailyn: Oh,
oh -- Student:

00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:16.929
[inaudible.]
Professor Charles

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:18.019
Bailyn: Yes,
sorry, exactly right.

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:20.509
It doesn't have to pass through
the center of the star.

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.869
It can graze the tip at the
bottom of the star a little bit.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.680
And in fact,
in this object,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.434
you can tell how close to the
center it goes by the exact

00:17:29.434 --> 00:17:33.859
shape of the curvature down at
the bottom of that light curve.

00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:37.109
Because, you know what the
expected distribution of

00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:39.970
brightness across the face of
the star is.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.289
You also know something about
the radius of the star.

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:45.326
This is supposed to be a
solar-type star,

00:17:45.326 --> 00:17:47.210
presumably has a radius of the
Sun.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.172
If it passes across,
sort of grazes the bottom,

00:17:51.172 --> 00:17:56.082
then the dip will be shorter,
because it will pass through

00:17:56.082 --> 00:17:58.496
faster.
And so, you can figure out

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:01.260
exactly what the trajectory
across the thing is.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.657
Most of the time it misses.
And in this case,

00:18:03.657 --> 00:18:07.259
you can figure out that the
angle of the inclination,

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:09.885
so-called,
which is 90 degrees if it's

00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:12.378
exactly edge-on,
is 80--I think 88 point

00:18:12.378 --> 00:18:14.339
something,
I don't remember the answer.

00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:17.042
Because, it doesn't go exactly
across the center,

00:18:17.042 --> 00:18:19.349
it goes, sort of,
sort of halfway down.

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:23.220
So yeah, that actually gives
you additional information.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.607
How long the dip is and what
the exact shape of the thing,

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.610
tells you which part of the
star it passes across.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:37.010
Yes good, thanks Bethany.
Other questions about this?

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.547
Yeah?
Student: Have we ever

00:18:39.547 --> 00:18:41.572
discovered a planet through
transit without having

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.699
discovered it previously?
Professor Charles

00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.882
Bailyn: Right,
have we discovered a planet

00:18:45.882 --> 00:18:48.791
through transit without having
discovered the previous radial

00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:51.569
velocity curves?
Yes, and we'll get to that.

00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:56.286
Because, let me just say this:
as soon as this was discovered,

00:18:56.286 --> 00:19:00.181
people got way excited,
because it's quite difficult to

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.849
make these kinds of precise
radial velocity measurements.

00:19:03.849 --> 00:19:06.029
You have to have very
specialized equipment.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.930
Only a few people in the world
can do it.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.890
There's this bunch of people in
California who can do it.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.150
There's this bunch of people in
Switzerland who can do it.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.279
Us – normal astronomers,
don't have that kind of

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.409
expertise and equipment,
but measuring a change in

00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:21.220
brightness of a star by 2%,
that's easy.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.850
I can do it up on Science Hill
[an area of the Yale campus

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.024
where the Astronomy Department
is located]

00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:25.140
in our little observatory up
there.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.069
In fact, I have done it for
this star.

00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:31.448
You can--if the timing were
better, this star is up in the

00:19:31.448 --> 00:19:35.254
summertime, unfortunately.
If it were up in the fall we

00:19:35.254 --> 00:19:38.799
would have this be an exercise
in Astro 155 [a Yale Astronomy

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:40.566
class],
because it's entirely

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:43.424
straightforward to go and
measure a 2% difference in

00:19:43.424 --> 00:19:45.808
brightness in a star.
Anybody, you know,

00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:49.041
with 2,000 bucks' worth of
equipment, you can go out into

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:51.350
your backyard and do this
experiment.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.641
This is a big deal.
So, as soon as that was

00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:56.853
possible, everybody got fired
up, you know,

00:19:56.853 --> 00:19:58.960
"I'm going to play this game
myself."

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.046
And we all laid very elaborate
plans for going out and finding

00:20:03.046 --> 00:20:06.677
zillions of planets.
And the problem is that it has

00:20:06.677 --> 00:20:10.559
to be exactly aligned edge-on
for this to even occur.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:16.420
And so, most stars with
planets--this doesn't happen.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.761
And so, you would have to
observe many,

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:24.069
many, many stars in order to
see this one time.

00:20:24.069 --> 00:20:27.486
So you have to--while it's easy
to do for any one particular

00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:30.903
object, it's hard to discover
them this way because you have

00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:34.758
to do it in bulk.
You have to look at many stars

00:20:34.758 --> 00:20:37.505
at once.
So then, people thought,

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:40.519
well, great,
we know how to do this.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.569
We'll look at many stars at
once.

00:20:42.569 --> 00:20:46.365
We'll take pictures of star
clusters, of--where there are

00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:49.310
lots and lots of stars.
And we'll just keep taking

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.859
pictures of these star clusters
over and over again.

00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:56.506
You'll look at 30,000 stars at
a time, and if one of them has a

00:20:56.506 --> 00:21:00.070
dip, we'll find that dip.
And so, the way we'll deal with

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.804
the fact that this doesn't
always occur is by looking at

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.048
star clusters.
And so, they tried this,

00:21:05.048 --> 00:21:07.845
again, with the space
telescope, because it works

00:21:07.845 --> 00:21:10.059
better at doing this kind of
thing.

00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:12.237
The problem with star clusters
is that the stars are really

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.964
close to each other,
so from the ground it just

00:21:13.964 --> 00:21:15.488
looks like a mush.
In this case,

00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:17.529
you have to see the stars
separately.

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:22.414
So, they took a particular star
cluster--also the advantage of

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:25.697
doing it from space is no
daytime, and so,

00:21:25.697 --> 00:21:29.979
you can observe continuously.
So, they took eight consecutive

00:21:29.979 --> 00:21:33.258
days of Hubble Space Telescope
time and did nothing but look at

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:36.420
a star cluster,
a cluster called--famous

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.460
cluster called 47 Tuc,
37 stars.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.060
They took repeated images of
this star cluster,

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.738
and they figured,
we ought to see some number of

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:50.849
planets by the transit method,
first, in this cluster.

00:21:50.849 --> 00:21:52.700
So just, here's what the
cluster looks like.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.818
So this, on the left,
is a ground-based picture of

00:21:55.818 --> 00:21:58.172
this cluster,
and you can see what the

00:21:58.172 --> 00:22:01.799
problem with observing this
stuff from the ground is.

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:04.630
If you look down in the middle,
it's all mushed together.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.710
You wouldn't be able to pick
out individual stars.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.937
But then, this box here,
blown up to the right-hand side

00:22:10.937 --> 00:22:14.400
of the picture--this is what
that little box looks like from

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.723
the Hubble Space Telescope.
And now, you have the

00:22:17.723 --> 00:22:21.804
resolution to observe each of
these stars, or many of them

00:22:21.804 --> 00:22:24.586
individually.
And so they took eight nights

00:22:24.586 --> 00:22:27.632
of Hubble Space Telescope
time--that's a lot of time on

00:22:27.632 --> 00:22:30.725
the space telescope.
The space telescope costs about

00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:33.855
a $1,000,000 a day to run.
And so, this is 8,000,000

00:22:33.855 --> 00:22:40.625
bucks' worth of observing time.
Okay, so what did they expect

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:41.940
to see?

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:59.430
So, finding planets directly
from transits.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:07.935
And so, they observe a cluster
of stars--30,000 stars at a

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:12.420
time.
So, what do you expect?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.426
Well, it turns out,
from the radial velocity

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:18.572
studies, they had gone and
looked at a lot of,

00:23:18.572 --> 00:23:22.342
sort of, Sun-like stars.
So, 30,000 more or less

00:23:22.342 --> 00:23:24.864
Sun-like stars,
I should specify,

00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:29.041
from the radial velocity
measurements from the Doppler

00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:30.460
measurements.

00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:39.088
They got answers like
approximately 1 out of 10

00:23:39.088 --> 00:23:44.869
stars--this is a rough estimate
– have Hot Jupiters.

00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:47.960
And then, how precisely aligned
do they have to be?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:59.621
Approximately 1 out of 100 Hot
Jupiters is aligned properly to

00:23:59.621 --> 00:24:02.680
get a transit.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.250
And so, now,
you have a prediction.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.290
You look at 30,000 stars.
A tenth of them have planets,

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.201
that's 3,000 planets.
One hundredth of those will be

00:24:14.201 --> 00:24:17.120
aligned up in such a way that
you can see a transit.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:23.700
That's thirty transits.
Predict-- thirty transits.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.767
And it was that kind of
calculation--this is just a

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:29.344
rough estimate,
but they had done this much

00:24:29.344 --> 00:24:32.805
more precisely.
It was that kind of estimate

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:37.724
that persuaded the people at the
Space Telescope Institute to

00:24:37.724 --> 00:24:42.644
allocate all these many hours of
space telescope time to this

00:24:42.644 --> 00:24:50.139
project.
The result was zero transits,

00:24:50.139 --> 00:24:54.029
none.
Not seen.

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:56.810
And this was a little
distressing, except it didn't

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.257
take people very long to figure
out that they should have known

00:25:00.257 --> 00:25:02.657
this in advance.
And this is--you know,

00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:05.760
you get a result and then of
course people--you get an

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.284
unexpected result,
and then people start writing

00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:10.427
papers which say,
well, of course that's what you

00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:13.300
should have gotten.
Any fool could have predicted

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.754
that you would not see any
transits in a star cluster,

00:25:16.754 --> 00:25:20.587
except none of the fools did.
Let's see, so--but,

00:25:20.587 --> 00:25:24.541
in retrospect,
it was clear that this wasn't

00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:30.610
going to give you the thing you
thought because of two factors.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.254
First, in--why?
So, first factor:

00:25:34.254 --> 00:25:37.192
in clusters,
the stars are really close

00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:41.546
together.
Stars--they sometimes collide

00:25:41.546 --> 00:25:45.799
or more often have near
collisions.

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:50.865
And when a star comes cruising
into your planetary system,

00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:55.097
the star has a lot of gravity.
It's going to completely wreck

00:25:55.097 --> 00:25:57.734
the orbits of the planets
because you're going to have the

00:25:57.734 --> 00:26:00.827
gravity of a second star.
And it turns out that what this

00:26:00.827 --> 00:26:02.799
does is it liberates the
planets.

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:08.730
And so, it will disrupt
planetary orbits.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.049
So, you kind of don't expect
there to be any planet;

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:17.861
you expect there to be planets
in the cluster,

00:26:17.861 --> 00:26:20.276
but they'll be free floating
planets sort of wandering around

00:26:20.276 --> 00:26:22.828
the cluster,
because they will have been

00:26:22.828 --> 00:26:26.928
detached from their parent star
by incoming stars--by close

00:26:26.928 --> 00:26:30.180
encounters with other stars in
the cluster.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.917
Put it this way.
The nearest star to the Sun,

00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:36.954
beside the Sun,
Alpha Cen, is about a parsec

00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:38.794
away.
In a cubic parsec,

00:26:38.794 --> 00:26:42.902
at the center of one of these
clusters, there are a million

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:45.378
stars.
And so, there are a million

00:26:45.378 --> 00:26:49.192
stars packed into the space
where only one star exists in

00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:52.360
our corner of the galaxy.
So, they run around--you know,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.587
if you were in a cluster,
if you were in a planet on a

00:26:54.587 --> 00:26:56.417
cluster,
and you were looking up at the

00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:58.970
sky, the constellations would
change from year to year,

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.847
because the stars are so nearby
that their motions would be

00:27:01.847 --> 00:27:04.474
readily apparent.
And once every few hundred

00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:07.389
million years,
a star would come cruising into

00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:11.599
your Solar System and detach all
of the planets from the star.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:15.259
And so, you don't expect there
to be any planets.

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:18.935
You also don't expect there to
be any planets for an entirely

00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:21.975
different reason,
which is, one of the things

00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:26.144
that had been discovered as they
were piling up all these Hot

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:29.339
Jupiters found by the Doppler
Shift method,

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:38.786
is that stars are more likely
to have planets--have

00:27:38.786 --> 00:27:49.743
planets--if they have high
amounts of heavy elements--heavy

00:27:49.743 --> 00:27:53.579
elements.
Now, let me explain that.

00:27:53.579 --> 00:28:01.450
Most stars--stars are mostly
hydrogen and helium.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:06.170
Astronomers do chemistry in a
very peculiar way.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.818
We have--we consider there are
three kinds of things in the

00:28:11.818 --> 00:28:14.008
universe.
There's hydrogen,

00:28:14.008 --> 00:28:16.309
there's helium,
and there's metal.

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:19.460
Chemists--everything else is a
metal.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.579
If don't care if it's oxygen,
carbon, whatever.

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:24.329
The chemists get really
uncomfortable with this.

00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:28.905
But, you know,
it's like the supposed

00:28:28.905 --> 00:28:32.642
primitive tribes.
I'm not sure these--this

00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:35.233
actually exists,
but the linguists say there are

00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:38.430
tribes in the world where they
count one, two and many.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.055
Well, this is how astrono--I
don't know if such tribes exist

00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:44.759
except for the astronomers,
who really do.

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:49.049
And we count,
one, two, and many.

00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:52.925
And we call any chemical
element heavier than helium a

00:28:52.925 --> 00:28:57.870
metal.
So, we have this concept called

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:06.730
metallicity, which is defined to
be the fraction of something of

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:13.059
elements heavier than hydrogen
and helium,

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:15.488
which are the first two in the
Periodic Table,

00:29:15.488 --> 00:29:18.160
as you probably know.
So, everything else is a metal.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:26.424
The metallicity of the
Sun--Sun's metallicity--is about

00:29:26.424 --> 00:29:28.726
2%.
And the metallicity of the

00:29:28.726 --> 00:29:32.271
Solar System is therefore about
2%, because the Sun's got all

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:36.778
the mass.
And, high metallicity stars,

00:29:36.778 --> 00:29:43.019
by which I mean,
metallicities greater than the

00:29:43.019 --> 00:29:51.160
Sun--greater than solar--are
more likely to have planets.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.611
This makes perfect sense.
This is the first thing in a

00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:58.118
little while that's made any
sense--because,

00:29:58.118 --> 00:30:01.276
how do you make a planet?
Well, planets aren't made out

00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:03.484
of hydrogen and helium.
Planets are made out of the

00:30:03.484 --> 00:30:05.932
other stuff.
We're made out of silicon and

00:30:05.932 --> 00:30:09.918
iron, and the--Jupiter's got a
lot of ice, and so all these

00:30:09.918 --> 00:30:13.766
kinds of heavy elements--you
don't make--you can't make a

00:30:13.766 --> 00:30:17.477
planet if all you've got is
hydrogen and helium because

00:30:17.477 --> 00:30:20.569
there's nothing solid to have it
form.

00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:23.270
And the only way you get to
keep your hydrogen and helium,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.640
the 98% of the stuff that's
hydrogen and helium,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.618
is if you already have a big
core of heavier--either rocks,

00:30:29.618 --> 00:30:33.940
or ice, or something else--if
you already have some metallic,

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.319
in the astronomical sense, core.
And so this makes perfect sense.

00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:42.109
If you don't have any metals,
you can't be forming planets.

00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:49.123
And star clusters of the kind
that Hubble observe are known,

00:30:49.123 --> 00:30:55.781
and this particular one is,
to consist of low metallicity

00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:56.970
stars.

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:04.378
In the case of 47 Tuc,
the one we looked at,

00:31:04.378 --> 00:31:08.473
it's--the metallicity of the
thing is, I think,

00:31:08.473 --> 00:31:13.903
about a fifth that of the Sun.
So, it's got very substantially

00:31:13.903 --> 00:31:19.490
fewer heavy elements.
So, no planets.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.593
So, in two different ways this
was a mistake,

00:31:23.593 --> 00:31:26.146
right?
But that was only realized

00:31:26.146 --> 00:31:28.333
afterwards.
And, it's unfortunate that it

00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:30.059
was a mistake in two different
ways.

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:33.032
Because if it was a mistake in
only one different way you would

00:31:33.032 --> 00:31:34.710
have learned something from
this,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.107
because you would have
confirmed the idea that a

00:31:38.107 --> 00:31:41.721
star--close stellar encounters
strip planets off of

00:31:41.721 --> 00:31:46.420
stars--except maybe it's only
because of the low metallicity.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.595
Or, you would have confirmed
the idea that low metallicity

00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:51.993
stars can't have planets;
except in this case,

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:54.720
maybe it's just because of the
stars and the planets have been

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.892
stripped away.
So it's kind of unfortunate

00:31:56.892 --> 00:32:00.084
that there were two excellent
explanations different from each

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:03.380
other about why you should have
predicted this result before you

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.198
obtained it.
However, having done that,

00:32:06.198 --> 00:32:09.685
it was clear what the next
experiment had to be:

00:32:09.685 --> 00:32:14.063
that you wanted to go out and
try and measure these transits

00:32:14.063 --> 00:32:17.550
in some region that's a little
less dense,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.319
and a whole lot more metal rich.
So, next experiment,

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:30.490
which was done last summer,
didn't look at a star cluster.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.013
It looked at the center--a
region close to the center of

00:32:33.013 --> 00:32:33.610
the galaxy.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:45.044
So, this is lots of stars,
but significantly less dense

00:32:45.044 --> 00:32:52.980
than what you would get in the
center of a cluster.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.948
Fortunately,
they had put up a bigger camera

00:32:55.948 --> 00:33:00.228
into the space telescope since
then, so you could cover more of

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:03.630
the sky, which was useful.
This is the camera;

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.904
by the way, you may have read,
over the weekend,

00:33:05.904 --> 00:33:08.130
that Hubble's had a little bit
of a problem.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:14.529
The electronics in this wide
field camera have shorted out.

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:18.642
And so, Hubble's kind of in
trouble for--until they get the

00:33:18.642 --> 00:33:22.329
next visit, because its major
camera is now blind.

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:24.943
And this happened,
I should say,

00:33:24.943 --> 00:33:29.579
12 hours after the deadline for
submitting proposals.

00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:33.855
So, there had been almost 1,000
proposals submitted from around

00:33:33.855 --> 00:33:37.233
the world, of which,
maybe only a fifth would ever

00:33:37.233 --> 00:33:39.546
get done.
People in our department and

00:33:39.546 --> 00:33:42.581
basically every department in
the whole--astronomy department

00:33:42.581 --> 00:33:45.464
in the whole world were going
nuts trying to prepare their

00:33:45.464 --> 00:33:47.690
detailed proposals for using the
thing.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.789
They submitted them,
and a few hours later it broke.

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:53.694
And so, then there was this
nice little email from the

00:33:53.694 --> 00:33:56.380
people at the Space Telescope
Institute saying,

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.907
"uhh, you might want to
reconsider, and we've created a

00:34:00.907 --> 00:34:05.853
new deadline three weeks from
now so that you can revise and

00:34:05.853 --> 00:34:07.990
extend."
There are other instruments

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.000
that still work but the cameras
aren't as good.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.035
And so, now,
everybody's scratching their

00:34:12.035 --> 00:34:14.121
head and thinking,
can I actually do this,

00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:16.309
and if I can,
what's the good strategy?

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:19.498
Do I want to try and do it now
when the competition's going to

00:34:19.498 --> 00:34:22.059
be much less because the
instruments are lousy?

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:25.321
Or, do I want to wait until
after September 2008,

00:34:25.321 --> 00:34:29.398
when they're scheduled to go up
replace the camera and repair

00:34:29.398 --> 00:34:31.658
the thing,
and try and do it with the good

00:34:31.658 --> 00:34:33.472
instruments then,
when everybody else in the

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:35.539
world is going to want to do
their experiment?

00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:39.139
And so, we're all grappling
with this at the moment.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.199
However, last summer this was
working like crazy.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.731
And they did another one of
these ten consecutive days of

00:34:44.731 --> 00:34:47.443
observations,
but this time of the center of

00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:49.730
the galaxy,
which has lots of stars--but

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.650
less dense than in the center of
the cluster, and also has the

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.469
advantage that many of these
stars,

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:57.180
most of them,
are high metallicity stars.

00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:03.847
So, hopefully,
this will work,

00:35:03.847 --> 00:35:06.503
right?
Because you've eliminated both

00:35:06.503 --> 00:35:10.030
of the excellent reasons why it
didn't work the last time.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:14.139
So, here is the field of view
that they were looking at.

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:16.460
This is a tiny piece of the
center of the galaxy.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.297
Lots and lots and lots of
stars, which is good,

00:35:19.297 --> 00:35:23.656
because you want to see them.
And these little circles here,

00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:27.081
which are numbered from 1 to
16, I believe,

00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:30.670
are circles around little
Sun-like stars.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.119
You can see the stars in the
middle of those circles;

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.400
you probably have a hard time
seeing.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.670
Let's turn the lights down.
This is kind of a nice picture.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.148
This is what the center of the
galaxy looks like to the Hubble

00:35:43.148 --> 00:35:45.926
Space Telescope.
And these bright things--the

00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:50.502
colors are sort of quasi-real.
These things are red giant

00:35:50.502 --> 00:35:54.458
stars and solar type stars.
The center of the galaxy is

00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:57.300
quite far away--are really quite
faint, you can barely see it.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.940
See in the middle of this
circle there's a little star

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.929
there, that's a Sun-like star in
the middle of the galaxy.

00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:08.949
And these circles are these
stars in which they found--in

00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:13.210
which they found transits.
So, in this case, it worked.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.971
So, it's true that one or the
other or both of those reasons

00:36:16.971 --> 00:36:20.159
they had why it didn't work in
the star cluster,

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:24.251
were in fact the reason it
didn't work in the star

00:36:24.251 --> 00:36:26.244
clusters.
Because here's a situation

00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:27.650
where those problems don't
exist.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.544
And now they found sixteen of
these things,

00:36:29.544 --> 00:36:32.340
which is pretty close to the
amount you would have expected.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.785
And so now it is--these are
planets, which have been

00:36:36.785 --> 00:36:40.360
discovered first by the transit
method.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.582
I should say,
there are a couple of others

00:36:42.582 --> 00:36:45.537
that have been discovered.
First by the transit method,

00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:48.668
from people at the ground just
going out and looking at random

00:36:48.668 --> 00:36:50.855
stars.
And in some of those cases,

00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:53.283
they have been done the
opposite thing,

00:36:53.283 --> 00:36:56.798
and gone back and found the
radial velocity measurements

00:36:56.798 --> 00:37:00.760
after having discovered the
tran--the planet by transits.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.598
You can't do radial velocity on
these guys because they're too

00:37:04.598 --> 00:37:07.430
faint, and it's just not going
to work out.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:20.679
Okay, how're we doing?
All right.

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:23.300
Now, a couple of consequences
of this.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:33.867
If you have both radial
velocity measurements,

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:43.260
which tell you the mass of the
planet,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.837
and transits,
which tell you the radius of

00:37:49.837 --> 00:37:58.340
the planet, then you know
something very important.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.760
You know the density.
Density--then,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.046
you get the density.
Density is usually written down

00:38:07.046 --> 00:38:10.031
with the Greek letter ρ,
for some reason,

00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:13.731
which I don't understand,
but it's always done that way,

00:38:13.731 --> 00:38:19.135
so we'll do it too.
And density is defined as mass

00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:24.289
of something divided by its
volume.

00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:28.641
And so, for a spherical object,
the volume--if you go back to

00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:31.760
some geometry book,
you can look this up.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:37.639
4/3π times the radius cubed,
and that's the density.

00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:43.426
The density,
if you--the density of water is

00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:48.810
about--is 1 gram per cubic
centimeter.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.030
Now, of course,
that's a lousy set of units.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.380
We do things in kilograms per
cubic meter.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.271
That's, as it turns out,
1,000 kilograms per cubic

00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:06.479
meter.
So, if you picture a cubic

00:39:06.479 --> 00:39:10.000
meter, that's a pretty huge
aquarium.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.010
It's actually pretty heavy.
And, let's see, is this right?

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.909
10^(2), 10^(6) times a
gram--yeah, that's right.

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:24.694
And, in fact,
interestingly enough,

00:39:24.694 --> 00:39:27.559
this is the definition of a
gram.

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:32.108
This is where they came up with
that metric unit--is to make it

00:39:32.108 --> 00:39:36.656
work out so that the density of
water is one--is exactly 1 gram

00:39:36.656 --> 00:39:40.203
per cubic centimeter.
You have to specify the

00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:42.438
temperature, too,
because--but,

00:39:42.438 --> 00:39:46.460
so, that's a typical density of
water, which is on ice,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:52.457
right?
Rocks have higher density--much

00:39:52.457 --> 00:39:58.150
higher density.
That's why a handful of iron is

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.826
heavier than an equivalent sized
handful of snow,

00:40:02.826 --> 00:40:07.988
or something like that.
So, if you know the density,

00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:13.619
you can tell something about
the composition of the planet.

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:19.218
And it turns out that the Hot
Jupiters, in the few cases we

00:40:19.218 --> 00:40:24.624
now have--it's not just one
case, it's several cases--Hot

00:40:24.624 --> 00:40:30.630
Jupiters have low density.
They really are ice balls.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.601
They're not made out of rock.
And so, an idea you might have

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.110
had about where the Hot Jupiters
come from is,

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:43.147
well, in these high metallicity
stars, there's just a whole

00:40:43.147 --> 00:40:45.870
bunch more rock,
and the Earth-like planets kind

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.789
of get big.
But that isn't what happened.

00:40:48.789 --> 00:40:51.570
These things really are made
out of ice.

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.888
And now you have a problem,
because you know how far away

00:40:54.888 --> 00:40:58.637
they are from the star.
And the temperature of these

00:40:58.637 --> 00:41:02.687
things--the surface temperature
of these things is,

00:41:02.687 --> 00:41:07.988
like, 1,000 degrees.
This is not a good place to put

00:41:07.988 --> 00:41:12.402
a snowball, all right?
You put a snowball in some

00:41:12.402 --> 00:41:16.701
place which is 1,000 degrees--we
won't specify the place--and

00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:19.710
something bad is going to happen
to it.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.964
Now, the--and so,
therefore, how could these

00:41:22.964 --> 00:41:28.107
planets have formed?
And so the idea--the current

00:41:28.107 --> 00:41:33.820
thinking on this is an idea
called migration.

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:44.843
And the idea behind migration
is that you make Jupiters in the

00:41:44.843 --> 00:41:49.619
Outer Solar System,
where they belong.

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:52.511
And then, through some
mechanism, which people have

00:41:52.511 --> 00:41:55.345
ideas about, but which
aren't--isn't at the moment

00:41:55.345 --> 00:42:00.336
really specified--these things,
after they are formed,

00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:06.000
they migrate into the Inner
Solar System.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.035
And the reason this is a useful
thing to do is that a big thing

00:42:14.035 --> 00:42:19.134
melts slowly.
The reason for that is that the

00:42:19.134 --> 00:42:22.900
surface area to volume ratio is
low.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:30.448
Volume goes up as the cube of
the radius--surface area,

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:33.769
goes up--as the square.
If you shine a light on

00:42:33.769 --> 00:42:37.321
something, the amount of energy
it picks up depends on how big

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:42.094
it is, not on how massive it is.
And so, changes of temperature

00:42:42.094 --> 00:42:46.195
in interacting with your
environment are less,

00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:48.820
the bigger you are.
This is why,

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.767
by the way, arctic animals tend
to be big: because they're

00:42:51.767 --> 00:42:54.507
trying to survive in an
environment that's much colder

00:42:54.507 --> 00:42:57.718
than they are.
And so, they generate energy by

00:42:57.718 --> 00:43:00.882
their volume and they lose it
out their skin,

00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:03.865
by their surface area.
So, you want to have a lot of

00:43:03.865 --> 00:43:05.420
volume compared to your surface
area.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.842
Big things melt slowly.
So, you can't have ice

00:43:08.842 --> 00:43:12.480
planetesimals in the Inner Solar
System.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.289
But you can have something the
size of Jupiter.

00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:17.503
And it'll melt,
but it'll take longer than the

00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:20.787
age of the Solar System,
or even the age of the

00:43:20.787 --> 00:43:23.730
universe, to do so.
So this is the idea.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.414
And of course,
the key point here is this

00:43:25.414 --> 00:43:28.400
migration.
And there are ideas about why

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.420
this should happen,
but it isn't wholly clear.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.064
Now, one thing,
a consequence of this idea,

00:43:37.064 --> 00:43:41.820
is that there are no
terrestrial planets.

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:48.226
No terrestrial planets,
because as this Jupiter is

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.760
moving inward,
if there's an Earth in the way,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.914
it's going to either knock it
out of its orbit completely,

00:43:53.914 --> 00:43:57.068
or the Earth will run into
Jupiter and become incorporated

00:43:57.068 --> 00:43:59.709
into that planet.
So, if you've got a

00:43:59.709 --> 00:44:04.305
Jupiter-size system in--near
where your Earth-like planet is

00:44:04.305 --> 00:44:06.858
orbiting,
that Earth-like planet's in big

00:44:06.858 --> 00:44:09.625
trouble for exactly the same
reason the planets are in

00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:11.721
trouble,
in general, when another star

00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:13.924
comes through,
because you've got something

00:44:13.924 --> 00:44:16.909
much more massive coming by,
screwing up your orbit.

00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:19.139
So, there are no terrestrial
planets.

00:44:19.139 --> 00:44:30.820
Their orbits are disrupted by
the migrating Jupiter.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.860
Now, in fact,
I have to qualify this a

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.315
little.
There was a paper that showed

00:44:36.315 --> 00:44:38.622
up in the literature,
a few months back,

00:44:38.622 --> 00:44:41.520
with some clever way of
preserving the terrestrial

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.893
planets as the Jupiter came by.
I have to say,

00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:49.599
I don't fully appreciate the
force of this argument.

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:53.636
It is perhaps true--because I
haven't read the paper carefully

00:44:53.636 --> 00:44:57.210
enough, but I feel obliged to
mention that somebody,

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.789
at least, has an idea about how
you can avoid it.

00:44:59.789 --> 00:45:04.227
But, in sort of straightforward
terms, you don't expect there to

00:45:04.227 --> 00:45:08.171
be terrestrial planets in a
situation where a Jupiter has

00:45:08.171 --> 00:45:11.974
migrated from the Outer Solar
System to the Inner Solar

00:45:11.974 --> 00:45:13.410
System.
Questions?

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.980
How are we doing?
Yes?

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.222
Student: I was just
wondering what caused the Hot

00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:19.591
Jupiters to migrate?
Professor Charles

00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:20.840
Bailyn: What causes the Hot
Jupiters to migrate?

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.889
This is a subject of some
discussion among the experts.

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.322
The idea is that when the
Jupiter forms,

00:45:28.322 --> 00:45:30.880
remember it forms out of a disc
of gas?

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.057
There might still be a
substantial residual gas and

00:45:35.057 --> 00:45:38.037
dust disc.
And as the Jupiter plows

00:45:38.037 --> 00:45:42.570
through it, the friction with
that disc slows it down.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:46.359
And if you slow down the orbit
of a planet, it'll gradually

00:45:46.359 --> 00:45:48.420
fall inwards.
That's one idea.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.250
There are some--there are other
ideas.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.161
But it isn't clear.
And if it were clear,

00:45:54.161 --> 00:45:56.449
you would have predicted it to
happen.

00:45:56.449 --> 00:45:58.570
And indeed, there's a whole
problem with the migration

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.993
theory.
So, problem with migration is,

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:09.148
sometimes it doesn't work.
Because, Jupiter in our Solar

00:46:09.148 --> 00:46:12.780
System is where Jupiter is.
It didn't migrate.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:19.181
It has to work--needs--so,
the problem with the migration

00:46:19.181 --> 00:46:24.440
system is, it needs to work,
but not always.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:29.670
It also can't work too well,
because if it works too well,

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.432
then the Jupiter falls right
into the Sun,

00:46:33.432 --> 00:46:36.217
right?
So, it has to work most of the

00:46:36.217 --> 00:46:39.079
time, but not all the time,
but not too well.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:45.699
This is a complicated balancing
act.

00:46:45.699 --> 00:46:49.230
And, whatever theory you
propose, whether it's this

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.266
friction with a dust disc,
or anything else,

00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:56.219
you've got a little problem
with this whole concept.

00:46:56.219 --> 00:47:01.058
Because you have to tune this
mechanism up so that it takes

00:47:01.058 --> 00:47:04.812
most Jupiters,
moves them into the Inner Solar

00:47:04.812 --> 00:47:07.403
System,
and then stops working at just

00:47:07.403 --> 00:47:10.360
the right point to leave you
with a whole bunch of Hot

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.960
Jupiters,
most but not all of the time.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.469
All right, that's as much as we
know about it.

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:20.468
That's--you know,
you got to come back three

00:47:20.468 --> 00:47:22.931
years from now and see if we've
straightened this out,

00:47:22.931 --> 00:47:25.070
because that's where we are at
the moment.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.603
All right, more later.

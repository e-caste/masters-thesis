00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.220
Professor Mark Saltzman:
There were a few things I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.263
didn't get to finish last time
in talking about particularly

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:23.914
gene transfer in mammals.
I want to finish with that and

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.464
then start on the topic for this
week which is an introduction to

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.725
cellular physiology.
In particular,

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:33.877
cell culture technology or how
you culture cells outside the

00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:37.092
body.
This is the slide that I

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:42.303
left on last time and the idea
here was to use plasmids,

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:47.324
which I talked about last
Thursday, to introduce genes

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:52.691
into animals.
Here, the plasmid is directly

00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:58.141
injected into a cell.
The cell is a fertilized egg,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:03.483
so you take a fertilized egg
and you directly inject plasma

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:07.296
DNA into the pronucleus,
into one of the

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:11.607
pronucleus--pronuclei.
This solves a major problem

00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:16.582
which I'm going to talk about
just at the beginning of class

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:21.390
here in a slide or two,
is 'how to get DNA into cells?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.823
We talked last week,
or the week before,

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:29.693
about the plasma membrane and
something about the chemistry of

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:33.605
the plasma membrane:
a lipid bilayer that's stable

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:37.757
in water because it's arranged
in such a way that the

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:42.468
hydrophilic parts of the lipid
molecules are exposed to both

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:46.780
the outer and the inner surface
of the cell.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.535
There's lipid chains in between
so cell membranes are lipid rich

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:57.176
layers that can exist in water.
Because of that they're

00:01:57.176 --> 00:02:00.995
barriers, they separate the
inside of the cell from the

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.918
outside of a cell,
and only certain kinds of

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.450
molecules can pass through a
cell membrane.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.647
It has to be small,
and it has to be lipid soluble

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:12.909
in order for it to pass through
a cell membrane.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.379
Well, plasmid DNA is
neither of those.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.765
It's very water soluble and
it's a big molecule,

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:23.052
a very big molecule;
it can't naturally get inside

00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:26.779
cells on its own.
We talked about this a little

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.384
bit in section last week,
when you eat vegetables or

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.714
meat,
you're eating a lot of DNA but

00:02:32.714 --> 00:02:36.418
that doesn't enter the cells of
your body because of the barrier

00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:41.328
properties of cell membranes.
To get genes and gene transfer

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:46.604
vectors into cells is a problem.
Here, the problem is solved by

00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:49.649
injecting it directly into the
cell, shown here,

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.759
and then that's one issue with
gene delivery.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.656
The second issue is that the
gene vector, in this case the

00:02:56.656 --> 00:03:00.415
plasmid, has to be compatible
with the cells that you're

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:05.384
trying to express the gene in.
that means that the cells have

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:09.528
to be able to replicate the DNA
on the plasmids,

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:13.319
in order to make many more
copies of it.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.004
It has to have an origin of
replication, which we talked

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.151
about last time,
which is compatible with the

00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:20.523
cells.
It also has to have a

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:24.439
promoter for the gene that the
cells can recognize.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.127
In this case the promoter,
which is a sequence of DNA that

00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:33.650
is positioned right in front of
the gene of interest,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.902
the promoter is the
betagalactoglobulin promoter in

00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:39.699
this case, and
betagalactoglobulin is a milk

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.998
protein.
You're taking advantage of a

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:46.954
promoter system,
or a gene activation system,

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:52.260
that this species knows about
because adult animals can make

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.613
milk.
When they make milk they have

00:03:55.613 --> 00:04:00.519
signals for turning on the
betagalactoglobulin promoter and

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.750
expressing the gene of interest.
Both of those things have to be

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.915
correct.
You have to be able to get the

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.325
DNA into the cell,
it has to be incorporated into

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:13.267
a vector of some sort,
and the vector has to be

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:17.555
compatible with the species and
the cells that you've provided

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:19.537
the DNA to.
In this case,

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:22.588
if everything goes right,
you inject the DNA into the

00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:25.797
pronucleus,
you implant this fertilized egg

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:29.339
into a foster mother,
the mother gives birth to

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.567
offspring,
it develops and when it

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:37.120
develops this foreign DNA is in
the offspring.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.964
When this animal makes milk,
it makes all the normal milk

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:47.500
proteins, but it also activates
your gene of interest as well.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.760
So you could collect your gene
of interest in the milk.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.553
Does that make sense?
This concept of introducing

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:58.344
foreign genes,
genes that are made of

00:04:58.344 --> 00:05:02.918
recombinant DNA into animals
using this kind of technique is

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:06.019
widely used in biomedical
research.

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:11.873
One of the ways that it's used
is to take the fertilized egg

00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:16.184
from an animal,
a mouse, usually it's a mouse

00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:21.523
and inject in a vector that
contains a gene that is involved

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:26.478
in human disease of some sort.
One of the big problems

00:05:26.478 --> 00:05:30.706
with studying human diseases is
that you can study how they

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:35.153
occur in people but there's only
a limited amount that you can

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:38.231
learn from people.
If animals get a similar

00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.967
disease then you can learn about
that disease progression in much

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:45.541
more detail in the animal.
But, unfortunately,

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:51.481
there aren't good animal models
for many of the diseases that

00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.758
we'd like to study.
Alzheimer's disease is a good

00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:58.216
one.
Millions of humans affected by

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.222
Alzheimer's disease,
other species don't get

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:04.958
Alzheimer's disease.
You can produce animals that

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.825
have a disease that's similar in
some ways to Alzheimer's disease

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:14.006
by taking the genes that are
involved in Alzheimer's and

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:17.730
introducing them into mice,
for example.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.715
You do that by expressing the
genes in the mice in the way

00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:23.858
that I described on the last
slide and it's shown in a little

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:27.542
bit more detail on this slide.
Those animals that you produce

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:31.220
are called transgenic animals
because they're expressing,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.082
usually at high levels,
a transgene or a gene that's

00:06:37.082 --> 00:06:41.680
not normally present in their
species.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.984
How would you accomplish
this kind of - how would you

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:49.290
accomplish gene transfer in
adult humans?

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.639
Those two examples I just gave
you, one had to directly inject

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.814
a gene containing vector into
the pronucleus of a fertilized

00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:04.550
egg and you don't have that
opportunity in adults.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.757
You already have an adult
organism and you'd like to get

00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:09.325
the gene transferred.
Before we talk about how to do

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:12.341
it, and we don't have perfect
ways to do it yet but I'll

00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:14.699
describe some of the ways that
are used,

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.743
I want to talk just briefly on
this slide about what the goals

00:07:18.743 --> 00:07:21.968
for gene therapy might be.
There's a variety of

00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:25.332
different ways to think about
using gene therapy and they're

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:30.550
illustrated in this picture.
One way is to replace a gene

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.960
that's defective in a disease.
Usually this is a disease

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.519
that's caused by a defect in a
single gene.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.331
We talked about sickle cell
anemia last time,

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.881
that's an example.
Another example is cystic

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:50.326
fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis is a disease

00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:53.620
that affects many organ systems,
but particularly the lung.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.849
You get cystic fibrosis because
one protein that's made by your

00:07:58.849 --> 00:08:02.560
lung epithelium is not expressed
properly.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.123
You're able to make the protein
but the protein doesn't function

00:08:07.123 --> 00:08:10.401
properly.
You could potentially treat

00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:16.283
cystic fibrosis by providing the
correct gene and providing it to

00:08:16.283 --> 00:08:19.959
all the cells of the lung
epithelium.

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:23.394
Because of this,
because cystic fibrosis is a

00:08:23.394 --> 00:08:26.829
disease that's caused by a
single gene defect,

00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:30.934
there's been great interest in
trying to treat cystic fibrosis

00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:34.063
with gene therapy.
The idea would be to try to

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:37.497
give, usually in the
lungs--people have thought about

00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:41.129
this because that's where the
main manifestations of the

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:45.289
disease occur--and introduce a
gene vector into the lungs,

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:49.155
perhaps by having a patient
inhale it or by somehow

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:53.742
instilling into the lungs,
in such a way that these gene

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:58.003
vectors get taken up by lung
cells and the gene gets

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:03.029
expressed throughout the lung.
This might be a plasmid.

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:06.751
It might be a plasmid that
contains a promoter that works

00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.340
in lung cells and that has the
cystic fibrosis gene.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.095
Well, now,
how would you get the gene into

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:16.255
the cells?
Well, one way you can get it is

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:20.480
by mixing the gene with lipids,
with lipid molecules.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.360
Special lipids that do this are
called cationic lipids.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.157
They're lipids but they also
have a charged portion,

00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:31.230
a positively charged portion
which interacts with DNA.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.785
So you form DNA lipid complexes
and because the DNA is complexed

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:40.123
with lipids it's more soluble in
membranes and more likely to

00:09:40.123 --> 00:09:42.868
enter cells.
That's one way to do it and

00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:45.870
I'll talk about it in other ways
in just a minute.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.294
You get the idea here,
is to deliver the gene that

00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:51.460
you're interested in directly to
the tissue where it's being used

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.458
and in this case,
the idea is to introduce a gene

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.217
that's missing.
Now, in other cases you

00:09:57.217 --> 00:10:01.228
might want to introduce a gene
that's not even normally present

00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:03.511
in people.
You're doing that because you

00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.600
want to treat disease in a
different way.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.911
One way that that's done is by
introducing genes into cancer

00:10:09.911 --> 00:10:13.491
cells, genes that aren't
normally expressed in any

00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:17.196
mammalian cell,
but that will cause the cancer

00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:19.924
cell to die.
This example here,

00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:25.769
the idea is to introduce a gene
into tumor cells of a tumor.

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:30.600
It's a gene that allows you to
deliver a drug that's not active

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.042
but the gene causes that active
- that inactive drug to be

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:39.250
converted into an active form
that kills the cell.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.467
This is called a suicide gene.
Basically, you're introducing

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:48.244
this gene into cells that when
you give the right inactive drug

00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:51.840
that will cause the cell to make
chemicals that kill it.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.915
Does that make sense?
This is a way of

00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:58.590
introducing cytotoxicity or cell
killing ability into a cell,

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.157
and that's been used to treat
many kinds of cancers,

00:11:01.157 --> 00:11:02.970
particularly cancers of the
brain.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.427
The problem is the same,
how do I get the gene that I

00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:09.019
want into only the cells that I
want?

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:12.462
You can see that it would be
problem here if the gene that

00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:16.206
you were trying to give to the
cancer cells also went to normal

00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:20.019
cells--that would be a problem.
This is a common problem in

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:22.650
gene therapy.
You would like to get the gene

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.918
that you're interested in
expressed in some population of

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:28.720
cells within the body but not in
other cells.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.309
So, making gene therapy
specific is a key problem in

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:36.835
making it work.
These are two examples I

00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:41.039
just gave you of introducing
genes that affect the life of a

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:43.018
cell,
either by making it express a

00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:45.931
protein that it's not making
properly that's important to its

00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.434
life,
or by intentionally killing a

00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:51.350
cell by having it express a
fatal gene.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.752
The other examples on the
bottom of the slide here are

00:11:54.752 --> 00:11:58.090
introducing genes that affect
neighboring tissues.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.157
So one way to do this might be
to - if you're trying to treat a

00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:07.734
heart that has disease and
usually it's disease in one of

00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:12.229
the coronary vessels or the
blood vessels that serve the

00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:14.850
heart,
that provide blood to the heart.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:21.266
Coronary artery disease is one
of the major causes of death in

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:25.725
western countries.
It occurs because blood flow

00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:30.690
gets reduced in that blood
vessel and so the heart muscle,

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.955
which is actively beating all
the time, needs large quantities

00:12:33.955 --> 00:12:37.061
of oxygen provided by blood
can't get the blood through the

00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:39.761
vessel.
Here, a concept is to

00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:44.745
introduce a gene that causes the
process of new blood vessel

00:12:44.745 --> 00:12:47.785
growth.
If you could introduce that

00:12:47.785 --> 00:12:52.340
gene you'd make the chemical,
in this case it's a protein

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.000
called vascular endothelial
growth factor.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.118
The name of the molecule isn't
important, but it's a molecule

00:12:59.118 --> 00:13:02.236
that stimulates the heart to
produce new blood vessels around

00:13:02.236 --> 00:13:04.262
it.
This is introducing a gene,

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:07.957
it's a natural gene but it's
not - it's a natural gene that's

00:13:07.957 --> 00:13:11.775
found in humans and is actually
expressed all over your body in

00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:15.195
different levels,
but you're concentrating it or

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:18.982
over expressing it in one
particular region of tissue in

00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:21.529
order to have a particular
effect.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:25.720
You're taking a normal gene and
you're over expressing it or

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.840
expressing it more abundantly
than normal in one particular

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.610
spot of the body to have an
effect.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:38.275
One last example here is
that you might want to put a

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:44.649
gene in that makes a protein in
a tissue that doesn't ordinarily

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:50.618
make it so that that tissue can
make large quantities of the

00:13:50.618 --> 00:13:56.384
protein and serve sort of as a
source of that protein as a

00:13:56.384 --> 00:14:00.250
drug.
The example might be insulin.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.700
Your pancreas normally makes
insulin.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.959
Diabetics whose pancreas does
not function properly,

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:09.836
so don't make enough insulin,
don't have enough insulin

00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:14.159
present for normal glucose
metabolism so they can't handle

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:17.699
sugars properly.
What if you injected the gene

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:22.189
for insulin into their muscle so
that their muscle cells in one

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:25.519
particular location started
making insulin?

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:29.530
Then that insulin would
accumulate in the muscle,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.456
enter the blood,
and circulate all over the body

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:38.720
and so you'd turn the muscle
into an insulin making tissue.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.216
Those are some example of
different strategies for using

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:47.625
gene therapy in people.
Well, I talked about the

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:51.090
problem of using plasmids in
gene therapy,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.399
that it's very difficult to get
them into cells.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:15:01.770
There are other vectors that
are very efficient at getting

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.997
DNA into cells.
Viruses, in particular,

00:15:05.997 --> 00:15:11.259
are very effective at
delivering their viral DNA into

00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:14.359
cells.
If you catch a cold you get

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:18.982
exposed to someone who has a
virus that's causing an upper

00:15:18.982 --> 00:15:23.803
respiratory infection,
they cough near you that virus

00:15:23.803 --> 00:15:28.924
enters your respiratory system,
it infects cells of your

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:33.580
respiratory system and those
viruses replicate.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.751
They basically make many,
many copies of their DNA and

00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:40.283
they make all of their viral
proteins and they assemble into

00:15:40.283 --> 00:15:43.841
new viral units.
Well, what if you could

00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:48.039
hijack that virus to carry genes
that you want?

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:55.453
You could do that by using the
techniques we described with

00:15:55.453 --> 00:16:02.738
restriction enzymes and ligases
to cut and paste the viral

00:16:02.738 --> 00:16:10.279
genome so that it contains the
gene of interest to you.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:14.534
You make a recombinant virus
that has all the normal

00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:19.539
components of the virus but also
has a gene that you want.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:23.613
Now, all you have to do is
introduce that virus into an

00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:27.611
organism and the virus will do
what it naturally does,

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:31.835
which is infect some cells.
Now, the other nice thing about

00:16:31.835 --> 00:16:35.424
viruses is not only are they
very efficient but most viruses

00:16:35.424 --> 00:16:38.039
are specific for certain kinds
of cells.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:41.782
The kinds of viruses that we
get when we have colds are very

00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:44.509
good at infecting the
respiratory system.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:49.830
If you get a flu that affects
your intestinal system then

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.629
those viruses are infecting gut
cells.

00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:56.673
There's other viruses that
infect cells of the brain,

00:16:56.673 --> 00:16:58.429
of the kidney,
of the liver.

00:16:58.429 --> 00:17:01.475
Hepatitis is a virus that
specifically affects the liver,

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:04.630
so viruses are often specific
to certain kinds of cells.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.902
That is also an advantage of
using them as gene therapy

00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:13.569
vehicles because they will only
infect cells that they are -

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:18.869
that they have an affinity for
or that they're prone to affect.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:22.348
This picture here,
we're going to come back to

00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:26.819
this later in two weeks when we
start talking about vaccines,

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.075
and we're going to talk about
how you make vaccines for

00:17:30.075 --> 00:17:33.572
viruses and so in doing that
we're going to think about the

00:17:33.572 --> 00:17:36.802
life cycle of a virus.
This is a life cycle of a

00:17:36.802 --> 00:17:40.059
particular class of viruses
called retroviruses.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:44.926
You know about retroviruses,
the most famous and important

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:49.109
one at this time is HIV,
which is a retrovirus.

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:52.800
This shows the greatly
magnified compared to the size

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.200
of a cell because viruses are
much, much smaller than cells.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.344
They might be 100 nanometers or
so in diameter,

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:03.829
whereas, a cell is ten microns
or so in diameter.

00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:08.128
These very small particles are
able to specifically recognize

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:12.233
certain kinds of cells.
They enter the cell after

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:16.304
recognizing, they fall apart
inside the cell,

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:21.486
they reproduce their DNA,
or their genetic material using

00:18:21.486 --> 00:18:24.998
host mechanisms.
They, in some cases,

00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:28.843
they integrate their DNA into
the host chromosome,

00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:33.549
that's what retroviruses do and
they make viral proteins.

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:36.836
Because they've made many
copies of their genome and

00:18:36.836 --> 00:18:40.445
they've made all the proteins
that are necessary to - for

00:18:40.445 --> 00:18:45.780
assembly of a new virus,
then this cell can make many

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.092
new viruses.
That's another advantage of

00:18:49.092 --> 00:18:51.569
using viruses as a gene therapy
vector.

00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:57.269
They can reproduce and so you
only need to give a few of them

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:01.640
in order to make many,
many inside the body.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.289
Why isn't that the solution
to gene therapy?

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:10.947
If you can genetically engineer
viruses like this and viruses

00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:14.666
have all those good properties
as gene therapy vehicles that I

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:16.710
described.
Why isn't this a solution?

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.720
Well, there are problems with
viruses as well.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.155
Retroviruses,
for example,

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:27.709
can only insert - can only
transduce and express their DNA

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:32.725
in cells that are dividing.
So if it's not a cell that's

00:19:32.725 --> 00:19:37.215
going through division you can't
use a retrovirus to express the

00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:39.982
protein.
They integrate their DNA into

00:19:39.982 --> 00:19:44.085
the host genome and you might
not want to make that kind of a

00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:47.439
change in the cell.
These are some problems with

00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:50.056
retro viruses.
Because of this people have

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:53.256
sought other kinds of viruses to
use as vectors and one that's

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:57.869
commonly used is an adenovirus.
Adenoviruses are viruses that

00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:03.039
give upper respiratory
infections, they cause colds.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:07.220
They can transduce non-dividing
cells so that's a good part.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.855
They can insert genes into
non-dividing cells and cause

00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:13.552
those genes to be expressed.
A problem with adenoviruses is

00:20:13.552 --> 00:20:16.454
that your immune system
recognizes them,

00:20:16.454 --> 00:20:20.696
and if your immune system
recognizes the virus then it can

00:20:20.696 --> 00:20:24.640
attack the virus and eliminate
it from the body.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.271
Now, normally that's a good
thing because if you're out in

00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:29.995
the world and you get infected
with adenoviruses you recover

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:33.217
from it,
your immune system can get rid

00:20:33.217 --> 00:20:35.590
of it.
But if you're trying to use

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.546
that virus as a gene delivery
vector and your body gets rid of

00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:42.529
it then the therapy has failed,
it's ended.

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:46.174
People have tried to produce
viruses that are different,

00:20:46.174 --> 00:20:49.752
adenoviruses for example,
that your immune system can't

00:20:49.752 --> 00:20:51.880
recognize.
Because of this,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.555
because of the natural
properties of viruses which

00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:59.079
sometimes are unwanted like in
retroviruses,

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:03.430
and the natural properties of
your immune system which can

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:08.189
cause you to reject viruses,
we've had great problems in

00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:13.219
making viruses that are both
safe and effective for gene

00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:17.499
therapy in people.
I talked about just not

00:21:17.499 --> 00:21:22.655
using viruses but using plasmid
DNA together with lipids and

00:21:22.655 --> 00:21:26.500
that's another strategy for gene
therapy.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.192
We'll talk later about other
kinds of vehicles when we talk

00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:34.590
about new methods for delivery
of drugs.

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:44.980
That's what I wanted to say in
finishing up last week's topic

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.255
of DNA technology.
What I want to do for the rest

00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:52.643
of the time today is talk about
- a little bit about cell

00:21:52.643 --> 00:21:56.213
physiology but I'm not going to
say too much for a couple of

00:21:56.213 --> 00:21:58.634
reasons.
I think most of you know

00:21:58.634 --> 00:22:02.039
something about the sort of
architecture and normal

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:05.784
structure of a cell and the
components within it and the

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:08.244
chapter,
Chapter 5, has a good

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:12.369
description of that for those of
you want a refresher.

00:22:12.369 --> 00:22:15.898
We'll talk a little bit about
the principles of cellular

00:22:15.898 --> 00:22:19.683
physiology and then I'll move
next time to talking about how

00:22:19.683 --> 00:22:24.110
you culture cells outside of the
body and what that's useful for.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.091
I said this sentence in one
of the first two classes,

00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:41.720
'all cells are the same',
and you know that's true.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.454
We talk about cells as being
kind of the fundamental unit of

00:22:45.454 --> 00:22:48.240
humans and other multi-cellular
organisms.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.220
Why do we talk about them as
the fundamental units?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.541
Because cells on their own are
alive, they can do the things

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:59.233
that we associate with life,
they replicate,

00:22:59.233 --> 00:23:03.375
they reproduce,
they metabolize,

00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:07.650
they can move,
they can grow,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.130
and they can use nutrients and
make wastes, and they work

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.130
cooperatively in order to
perform some function.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.606
This is a picture that I
showed you before,

00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:23.990
but basically tells you
something that you already know,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.881
that humans are made up of
organ systems,

00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:30.712
organs and organ systems,
those organs are composed of

00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:33.694
tissues.
What I didn't mention before

00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:38.149
was the four major types of
tissues which make up the organs

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:42.744
of our body: muscle tissues,
and the function of muscle

00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:46.906
tissues is to do work,
to contract in order to do

00:23:46.906 --> 00:23:49.681
work,
nervous tissue and the function

00:23:49.681 --> 00:23:53.105
of nervous tissue is to
communicate using electrical

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:55.589
impulses primarily to
communicate,

00:23:55.589 --> 00:23:59.411
epithelial tissues which form
linings in the body so your skin

00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:02.823
is an epithelial tissue,
the lining of your gut is an

00:24:02.823 --> 00:24:05.818
epithelial tissue,
the linings of all the glands

00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:09.450
in your body like the pancreas
are epithelial tissues,

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.309
and connective tissues which
are responsible for holding all

00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:17.440
these things together into one
unit.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.468
All cells are the same and
I say that because any cell

00:24:22.468 --> 00:24:27.320
within you or within me is the
same in many respects.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.381
It has a cell membrane.
If I looked inside it has the

00:24:31.381 --> 00:24:36.153
same kinds of components inside,
it has the same DNA inside the

00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:39.665
nucleus.
Let's take a step back and ask

00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:44.818
are all kinds of cells really
the same and start by talking

00:24:44.818 --> 00:24:50.150
about two cells that I know you
know are quite different.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.789
Cells that I took from a human
and cells that are in a

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:58.273
bacterium.
What are the differences

00:24:58.273 --> 00:25:02.009
between a bacterial cell and a
human cell?

00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:04.995
What are some of the
differences between a bacterial

00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:06.400
cell and a human cell?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.199
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:13.155
Mark Saltzman:
The bacterium doesn't have

00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:14.324
a nucleus,
and in fact,

00:25:14.324 --> 00:25:18.359
they don't have very well
formed organelles in general.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:25.799
Human cells have well-described
organelles inside of them.

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.965
You took biology in high
school, you learned the names of

00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:29.859
these organelles and their
principle functions,

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:32.770
the nucleus,
the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.297
the Golgi apparatus,
mitochondria,

00:25:35.297 --> 00:25:38.303
lysosomes.
Those things are all reviewed

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.968
in the chapter in the book.
I'm not going to talk about

00:25:41.968 --> 00:25:45.897
them in detail but please look
at that to remind yourself of

00:25:45.897 --> 00:25:49.493
those kinds of specialized
sub-cellular units which are

00:25:49.493 --> 00:25:53.490
present in cells in humans but
not present in bacteria.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:58.549
Why aren't they present in
bacteria?

00:25:58.549 --> 00:26:03.678
Why don't bacteria need a
distinct nucleus and that's

00:26:03.678 --> 00:26:06.440
necessary in a human cell?

00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:19.400
What else is different about
human cells and bacteria other

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.250
than these formed organelles?

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.472
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:26:28.472 --> 00:26:30.063
Mark Saltzman:
Human cells don't have a

00:26:30.063 --> 00:26:33.140
cell wall but most bacteria do.
There are different kinds of

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.954
cell walls in bacteria but they
have a rigid cell wall and our

00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:39.329
cells don't have a rigid cell
wall,

00:26:39.329 --> 00:26:41.630
we have a fluid lipid like cell
wall.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:48.103
Why is that the case?
Well, you could think about the

00:26:48.103 --> 00:26:51.049
cell wall of a bacterium as its
skeleton, it's what protects it

00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:53.519
from mechanical forces that are
out in the world.

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:55.410
We have other ways of
protecting;

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.654
many of our cells are inside
our body protected by

00:26:59.654 --> 00:27:03.380
specialized cells of our
skeletal system.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.860
They don't need that kind of
mechanical strength.

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:14.173
Another important
difference between human cells

00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:16.180
and bacterial cells is their
size.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.095
Bacterial cells are small,
one to two microns in diameter

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:24.359
and this shows a picture of a
common bacterium called E.

00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:29.739
coli. This is a bacterium
that's normally present in

00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:32.026
humans;
it colonizes all of our

00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:37.294
intestinal systems.
It's a common bacterium and

00:27:37.294 --> 00:27:42.009
most strains of E.
coli are not harmful to

00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:44.165
people, in fact,
they provide us with some

00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:48.409
beneficial properties.
A human cell shown here on the

00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:54.463
opposite side has these formed
organelles that I talked about a

00:27:54.463 --> 00:27:57.285
minute ago,
mitochondria,

00:27:57.285 --> 00:28:01.650
Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum,
nucleus.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.462
It's encased within a membrane,
a cell membrane which we talked

00:28:05.462 --> 00:28:08.628
about the structure of.
It's much larger than a

00:28:08.628 --> 00:28:12.663
bacterium, it's ten to 30
microns let's say instead of one

00:28:12.663 --> 00:28:15.920
to two microns,
so almost ten times bigger.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:22.144
One of the reasons why
human cells have compartments is

00:28:22.144 --> 00:28:27.940
because their functions are
segregated into regions.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.759
The nucleus contains all the
DNA, and so the early stages of

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:35.210
gene expression,
transcription,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.539
happened inside the nucleus
where all the DNA is.

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:43.156
One of the reasons why you
would want to segregate things

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:46.967
into certain regions is that
molecules have to move in order

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:51.266
to accomplish these things;
molecules have to move from one

00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:53.596
place to another.
In general,

00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:57.779
inside of a cell molecules move
by a process called diffusion.

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:01.797
They move from regions of high
concentration to regions of low

00:29:01.797 --> 00:29:05.353
concentration by this natural
flow down a concentration

00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:08.846
gradient.
Movement down a concentration

00:29:08.846 --> 00:29:14.028
gradient occurs fairly rapidly
over short distances like a

00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:18.210
micron or so,
like the size of a bacterium.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.787
Diffusion mixes things very
well, but as the size gets

00:29:22.787 --> 00:29:26.069
bigger, diffusion becomes very
slow.

00:29:26.069 --> 00:29:31.474
You're familiar with this,
if I had a jar of acetone or

00:29:31.474 --> 00:29:37.380
some kind of a volatile liquid,
let's say I have perfume.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.176
I have a jar of perfume and I
sit it here, if the room was

00:29:41.176 --> 00:29:45.171
perfectly still the molecules of
perfume would diffuse out of

00:29:45.171 --> 00:29:49.234
this jar and they'd start moving
through the room and those of

00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:53.430
you in the first row would smell
it within a few minutes,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.110
sometime later you'd smell it
one row back,

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.620
sometime later - and the
farther away you get the longer

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.687
it takes.
Because of the physics of

00:30:02.687 --> 00:30:06.390
diffusion it doesn't go linearly
with distance.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.720
That is, it doesn't take one
second to go the first,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.508
and then two seconds to go to
the second, and three seconds to

00:30:11.508 --> 00:30:14.582
go to third.
It varies with the square of

00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:19.768
distance so it goes - in order
to go twice as far it takes four

00:30:19.768 --> 00:30:22.887
times as long.
These details aren't important,

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:26.174
it is described in your book,
but the thing that is important

00:30:26.174 --> 00:30:29.569
to know is that diffusion occurs
fast over short distances,

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:33.549
but because of the physics of
diffusion it occurs slowly over

00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:37.261
longer distances.
Because of that you can't count

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:42.323
on molecules moving rapidly over
the size of a cell that's ten to

00:30:42.323 --> 00:30:45.683
30 microns in diameter.
Because of that,

00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:50.406
in order to efficient function,
then you group all the like

00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:55.315
activities together.
That's one way of thinking why

00:30:55.315 --> 00:31:00.475
animal cells have cells from
animals and humans have

00:31:00.475 --> 00:31:05.376
sub-cellular compartments.
Another thing that's

00:31:05.376 --> 00:31:09.884
different about human cells and
animal - human cells and

00:31:09.884 --> 00:31:14.801
bacterial cells is that many
bacterial cells can swim and can

00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:18.617
exist in suspension,
that means just suspended in a

00:31:18.617 --> 00:31:20.817
fluid.
In fact, that's their preferred

00:31:20.817 --> 00:31:23.989
state is suspended in a fluid
where nutrients are widely

00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:26.647
available to them,
and where they can swim from

00:31:26.647 --> 00:31:29.799
one spot to another in order to
get the nutrients they need,

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:32.900
or in order to run away from
toxic compounds.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.957
If you're a bacterium your
whole life is about swimming to

00:31:35.957 --> 00:31:39.230
nutrients and running away from
things that would kill you.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.581
Human cells,
most human cells,

00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:47.319
don't function very well in
suspension.

00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:51.785
If you take cells from my skin
and disperse them and we'll talk

00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:56.323
about ways to do that next time,
and you try to maintain them in

00:31:56.323 --> 00:31:59.134
a beaker.
Even if that beaker had all the

00:31:59.134 --> 00:32:02.943
nutrients that skin cells needed
they wouldn't survive very well

00:32:02.943 --> 00:32:05.976
in solution,
they tend to need to be stuck

00:32:05.976 --> 00:32:08.470
to a surface in order to
survive.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.089
That's what this picture on
the bottom shows you here.

00:32:11.089 --> 00:32:15.337
It's a picture of cells
actually growing and moving in

00:32:15.337 --> 00:32:18.200
cell culture.
This is a cell from connective

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.630
tissue called a fibroblast.
Instead of being round like

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.670
this cartoon of a cell when you
have the cell in culture,

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.739
in a plastic or a glass dish,
it tends to stick to the dish

00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:35.460
and spread out so it looks much
more like a pancake,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.369
a funny shaped pancake,
but a pancake than a sphere.

00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:44.712
This property of cells in
culture is called anchorage

00:32:44.712 --> 00:32:49.890
dependence - that the cell needs
to be anchored to a surface in

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.568
order to function properly.
That's another difference

00:32:54.568 --> 00:32:57.410
between human cells and
bacteria.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.902
Now, what does that have to
do with the life of a cell

00:32:59.902 --> 00:33:02.387
inside the body?
It's - this picture on the

00:33:02.387 --> 00:33:05.000
bottom shows the cell stuck to
plastic.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.329
Certainly that's not what it's
like when it's inside the body.

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:13.536
Well, it's true that it's not
stuck to plastic but it is stuck

00:33:13.536 --> 00:33:17.398
to other materials The other
materials that it's stuck to

00:33:17.398 --> 00:33:20.984
include other cells that
surround it and this complex

00:33:20.984 --> 00:33:24.914
matrix which surrounds all of
the cells in our body called

00:33:24.914 --> 00:33:28.638
extracellular matrix and I'll
get to that in just a few

00:33:28.638 --> 00:33:31.650
moments.
In some senses most of the

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:34.509
cells in our body are stuck to a
surface.

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:38.450
They're stuck to a surface
that's provided by the

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.292
environment that's around them,
they're not swimming free in

00:33:43.292 --> 00:33:46.964
solution.
Well, you know that cells

00:33:46.964 --> 00:33:51.469
in our body can reproduce.
Most of you have probably at

00:33:51.469 --> 00:33:55.329
some point or another learned
about the cell cycle,

00:33:55.329 --> 00:34:00.376
or the process of a cell going
from being a single cell to

00:34:00.376 --> 00:34:04.335
being two cells.
That's shown schematically

00:34:04.335 --> 00:34:08.702
here, let me talk about the
bottom diagram first,

00:34:08.702 --> 00:34:12.159
which shows the process of
mitosis.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:17.818
Mitosis is an orderly sequence
of events by which one parent

00:34:17.818 --> 00:34:23.630
cell becomes two daughter cells.
Several things happen during

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.728
mitosis, first,
when a cell enters the process

00:34:27.728 --> 00:34:32.920
of mitosis it already has twice
the DNA that it needs.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.115
So before a cell enters mitosis
it has to have synthesized its

00:34:37.115 --> 00:34:40.760
DNA so it has two copies of all
of its chromosomes.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:47.596
What happens during mitosis
is that the cell is able to

00:34:47.596 --> 00:34:54.197
separate this double set of
chromosomes into two sets and

00:34:54.197 --> 00:35:01.269
that happens in a way that's
shown in this cartoon here.

00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:06.045
It separates those duplicated
chromosomes to two sides of the

00:35:06.045 --> 00:35:11.060
cell, physically separates them,
and the cell itself pinches off

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.175
to form two new cells.
If this happens correctly,

00:35:16.175 --> 00:35:22.734
each of the new cells has
exactly the same composition as

00:35:22.734 --> 00:35:26.931
the parent cell.
Mitosis is one event that

00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:30.739
happens during this larger event
called the cell cycle.

00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:34.017
It's usually shown like a clock
is shown here,

00:35:34.017 --> 00:35:36.931
where time 0,
which is at the top here is

00:35:36.931 --> 00:35:40.937
right at the end of mitosis
where you have two new cells

00:35:40.937 --> 00:35:44.966
that are formed.
If I followed one of them it is

00:35:44.966 --> 00:35:49.193
in a phase that's called G1
first and this is a resting

00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:53.654
phase before it enters the
process of synthesizing new DNA

00:35:53.654 --> 00:35:57.489
in preparation for another round
of mitosis.

00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:01.479
G2 is a phase that indicates
the gap between when DNA

00:36:01.479 --> 00:36:05.929
synthesis occurs and when the
next mitotic event occurs.

00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:08.796
If cells were actively
proliferating,

00:36:08.796 --> 00:36:13.096
that is you had a population of
cells that are actively

00:36:13.096 --> 00:36:16.048
proliferating,
they would be going through

00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.130
continuous rounds of the cell
cycle.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.145
New cells are formed,
they wait a bit,

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:24.079
they synthesize DNA,
they wait a bit,

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:26.280
they divide,
and on, and on,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.246
and on.
Well, not all of the cells

00:36:29.246 --> 00:36:31.980
in your body are dividing at any
one time.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.809
Not all the cells are dividing;
in fact, cells in your brain

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:40.963
don't proliferate at all.
Some small subsets do but most

00:36:40.963 --> 00:36:45.269
of the cells in your brain don't
proliferate and that's because

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:48.949
they get trapped at one portion
of the cell cycle.

00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:53.181
They get arrested in the G1
phase, for example,

00:36:53.181 --> 00:36:58.332
and they never progress through
to the S phase where they

00:36:58.332 --> 00:37:02.407
synthesize DNA.
Cells can stop in their

00:37:02.407 --> 00:37:08.477
lifetime at some point in the
cell cycle and persist for long

00:37:08.477 --> 00:37:10.400
periods of time.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:20.091
This process of cell
proliferation or cell division

00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:23.929
is, of course,
very important during

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:29.717
development of an embryo.
During development of the

00:37:29.717 --> 00:37:36.079
embryo it goes from being a
single cell, the fertilized egg,

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:42.301
to being a multi-cellular
organism with billions of cells

00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:45.685
in it.
Those billions of cells come

00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:49.340
from successive rounds of cell
division.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.900
Now, I said before that all
cells are the same.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.581
When I talked about mitosis,
I talked about cells making

00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:05.696
perfect copies of each other,
so each parent cell becoming

00:38:05.696 --> 00:38:07.699
two daughter cells that are the
same.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:12.939
So if that was all that was
happening then an embryo would

00:38:12.939 --> 00:38:16.249
just be many,
many cells that are all

00:38:16.249 --> 00:38:20.570
identical and you know that's
not the case.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:26.454
Cells start to change and they
change in complex ways so that

00:38:26.454 --> 00:38:32.436
eventually when a fetus is born
it has some cells that make up

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:35.651
its brain,
some that make up the heart,

00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:39.597
some that make up the liver and
the skin, and all those cells

00:38:39.597 --> 00:38:44.411
are different in important ways.
I'm going to talk next

00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:50.208
week, or next time on Thursday,
about the processes that lead

00:38:50.208 --> 00:38:55.314
to differences between cells.
The general word for that

00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:58.939
process of making differences
between cells is

00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:03.148
differentiation.
When cells become more like

00:39:03.148 --> 00:39:08.505
cells of the mature brain
they're said to differentiate

00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:11.896
into brain cells.
When they become more like the

00:39:11.896 --> 00:39:13.960
liver, they differentiate into
liver cells.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.260
So we're going to talk about
that process more next time.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.866
What I want you to remember now
is that abundant cell

00:39:22.866 --> 00:39:27.030
proliferation takes place during
development.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:32.315
All of the cells that are
reproduced during development

00:39:32.315 --> 00:39:37.078
are the same in certain ways,
they contain the same DNA,

00:39:37.078 --> 00:39:40.137
they're all progeny of the same
fertilized egg,

00:39:40.137 --> 00:39:44.126
but differences are acquired
within specific cell populations

00:39:44.126 --> 00:39:46.720
during the process of
development.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.259
Some of those differences
in cells are obvious if you look

00:39:53.259 --> 00:39:55.329
at the cells in an adult
organism.

00:39:55.329 --> 00:40:00.262
In fact, some cells are very
different from the cells that

00:40:00.262 --> 00:40:03.809
are proliferating early in
development.

00:40:03.809 --> 00:40:08.385
One example of a very different
cell is a red cell or red blood

00:40:08.385 --> 00:40:12.739
cell, these are the cells that
give blood it's red color.

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:18.399
They make up about 45% to 50%
of the volume of blood is red

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:20.913
cells.
They're red because they

00:40:20.913 --> 00:40:24.958
contain a special protein called
hemoglobin which is very

00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:28.996
concentrated inside the cell.
Hemoglobin, as you know,

00:40:28.996 --> 00:40:33.456
is an oxygen carrier and so red
blood cells concentrate in bags

00:40:33.456 --> 00:40:37.556
of hemoglobin which circulate in
your blood and they carry

00:40:37.556 --> 00:40:40.307
oxygen.
Well, it was not very hard for

00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:43.829
me to draw this red blood cell
here, it's just an oval,

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:46.126
and one reason I draw it like
an oval, is that that's

00:40:46.126 --> 00:40:48.289
basically what it looks like if
you look at it.

00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:52.059
One of the most obvious things
about a red blood cell is it

00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:54.789
doesn't have nucleus,
it has no nucleus.

00:40:54.789 --> 00:41:00.380
Red blood cells are terminally
differentiated cells.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.000
They have become as different
as they can be.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.440
In fact, they're no longer
capable of reproducing;

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.099
all they can do is exist as red
blood cells and then die.

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:13.959
So, they've lost one of the
essential characteristics of

00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:19.260
these cells that are the same
that I talked about earlier.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.412
That's just an example of a
cell that in its very mature or

00:41:23.412 --> 00:41:27.278
differentiated form is quite
different from other cells

00:41:27.278 --> 00:41:29.779
inside the body.
On the other side of this

00:41:29.779 --> 00:41:31.179
diagram I show a picture of a
neuron.

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:35.389
This is just an example of what
a neuron might look like.

00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:39.087
Here's the nucleus in the
middle of the cell body and what

00:41:39.087 --> 00:41:42.915
- if you looked at a picture of
a variety of different cells

00:41:42.915 --> 00:41:46.678
that were isolated from adult
organisms you would recognize

00:41:46.678 --> 00:41:50.635
this immediately as a neuron or
something that's like a neuron

00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:54.658
because of the many small thin
projections that come out of the

00:41:54.658 --> 00:41:58.170
body of the cell.
Neurons have these projections

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.631
because one important property,
or one important function of

00:42:01.631 --> 00:42:04.329
neurons, is to communicate with
each other.

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:06.880
The way that they communicate
with each other is by physically

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.428
touching each other,
and the way that they connect

00:42:09.428 --> 00:42:12.742
across distances is by having
these process that extend from

00:42:12.742 --> 00:42:16.429
one place to another.
Like many cells in neurons,

00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:20.676
the shape of the cell is
intimately related to its

00:42:20.676 --> 00:42:24.721
function within the organism.
That's obvious when you look at

00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:27.182
neurons and it will be obvious
when we look at other kinds of

00:42:27.182 --> 00:42:29.390
cells as well.
Because of this,

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:33.241
often a biologist can
discriminate between different

00:42:33.241 --> 00:42:38.300
kinds of cells that they see in
section of a tissue for example,

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:44.079
merely by its shape and the
characteristics that it has.

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:46.094
One could easily,
for example,

00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:49.429
differentiate between a red
cell and a neuron,

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:52.246
but a skilled biologist who's
looked at many,

00:42:52.246 --> 00:42:55.895
many different cells could
differentiate between different

00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:58.459
types of neurons.
Maybe by the different

00:42:58.459 --> 00:43:00.843
branching patterns that these
processes had,

00:43:00.843 --> 00:43:04.170
or how many processes were on a
different kind of neuron,

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.482
you'd be able to tell something
about its function and probably

00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:09.460
something about where it came
from.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.019
You might be able to tell just
by looking at it what was - if

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:17.440
there was a disease what was
wrong with it.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.615
In between these two
pictures I show a picture of a

00:43:20.615 --> 00:43:23.342
fibroblast.
Fibroblasts are specialized

00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:26.250
cells that exist in connective
tissues.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.038
The connective tissue is one of
those four main types of tissue,

00:43:30.038 --> 00:43:33.706
they're supporting material -
supporting tissues that surround

00:43:33.706 --> 00:43:37.314
other cells in the body and give
the cell - and give the body

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:42.474
much of its mechanical property.
One of the important functions

00:43:42.474 --> 00:43:47.360
of a fibroblast is to allow for
healing of wounds.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.409
This shows a fibroblast that is
very stretched out.

00:43:52.409 --> 00:43:55.156
Remember when I showed you that
picture of cells attached to

00:43:55.156 --> 00:43:58.301
plastic a few minutes ago;
I said those were fibroblasts

00:43:58.301 --> 00:44:00.650
that were growing on a culture
dish.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.739
If I looked within the
skin, one of the lower layers of

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:07.630
your skin, the connective tissue
layer,

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.356
you'd find many fibroblasts
there and they're just waiting

00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:13.710
in a more rounded shape than
this,

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:19.108
just waiting to do their job.
Their job begins if you happen

00:44:19.108 --> 00:44:21.282
to cut yourself,
for example,

00:44:21.282 --> 00:44:24.890
or you get a wound.
When you get a wound several

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.624
things start to happen.
First, hopefully your blood

00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:33.536
clots and so that stops you from
dying from loss of blood there,

00:44:33.536 --> 00:44:37.980
but your body tries to heal
this wound that's created.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.907
One of the first steps in that
healing is that fibroblasts like

00:44:41.907 --> 00:44:45.771
this cell crawl into the space
that's created by the wound and

00:44:45.771 --> 00:44:49.509
they grab a hold of both sides
of the wound and contract and

00:44:49.509 --> 00:44:53.905
try to pull it together.
To do that they have to be able

00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:57.849
to stretch out and they have to
be able to pull.

00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:02.230
If you look at this picture of
this fibroblast you can imagine

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:06.479
that it's firmly stuck up here.
It's firmly adherent to the

00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:09.264
surface here,
it's firmly adherent at the

00:45:09.264 --> 00:45:11.686
back here,
and in between its trying to

00:45:11.686 --> 00:45:14.881
pull these ends closer together,
you can imagine that that's

00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:16.578
what it's doing,
and in fact,

00:45:16.578 --> 00:45:19.030
that's one of the functions of
fibroblasts.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:25.010
This is another example of how
the shape of a cell can tell you

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:30.777
something about its function,
how you can discriminate

00:45:30.777 --> 00:45:36.909
between different cells by
looking at how they look in

00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:41.735
their native environment.
Humans are collections of

00:45:41.735 --> 00:45:44.306
cells, all cells are the same in
important ways,

00:45:44.306 --> 00:45:47.150
but cells acquire differences
during development,

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:51.719
and so we are collections of
billions of cells.

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:56.327
What holds us together so that
when I leave the room most of my

00:45:56.327 --> 00:45:59.413
cells go with me?
What holds all these cells that

00:45:59.413 --> 00:46:01.409
are doing different things
together?

00:46:01.409 --> 00:46:04.634
Well, one thing that holds
cells together is that they're

00:46:04.634 --> 00:46:08.959
able to adhere to each other.
That cells that form tissues

00:46:08.959 --> 00:46:14.581
often have junctions that hold
them together so that they don't

00:46:14.581 --> 00:46:19.659
fall apart and they exist as a
solid piece of tissue.

00:46:19.659 --> 00:46:23.739
This diagram is supposed to
make you think about the

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:27.300
intestinal tract,
this tube that runs through our

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.269
bodies and allows us to acquire
nutrients from the environment.

00:46:32.269 --> 00:46:37.665
This tube, this hollow tube,
which food passes through is

00:46:37.665 --> 00:46:41.807
made up of many,
many epithelial cells which

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:47.299
directly abut one another and
would be a flat sheet except

00:46:47.299 --> 00:46:53.282
that it's rolled up into a tube.
It's this tube-like structure,

00:46:53.282 --> 00:46:56.920
which is made of many,
many epithelial cells all

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.587
directly adjacent to each other,
is what separates the outside

00:47:02.587 --> 00:47:07.967
world from our internal bodies.
We take bits of the outside

00:47:07.967 --> 00:47:10.869
world like food and we swallow
them.

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:15.877
One can imagine that when
they're inside this tube here,

00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:19.519
they're still really outside
the body.

00:47:19.519 --> 00:47:23.179
If it passed directly through
the tube and nothing happened to

00:47:23.179 --> 00:47:26.239
it, it would come out to the
outside world again.

00:47:26.239 --> 00:47:30.145
There's a continuous path from
the outside world right through

00:47:30.145 --> 00:47:33.291
the intestine.
That food only becomes part of

00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:36.969
us if it gets absorbed through
the intestinal wall.

00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:40.930
That is, if it can be absorbed
through this layer of

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.972
epithelium.
What happens in the intestine

00:47:43.972 --> 00:47:47.896
is that food gets broken down
into constituent molecules,

00:47:47.896 --> 00:47:51.820
some of those molecules are
absorbed into our bodies.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.358
They become part of us,
and the rest get - we get rid

00:47:56.358 --> 00:48:00.460
of and they remain part of the
outside world.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:04.412
It's these cells that are
sitting at the surface here that

00:48:04.412 --> 00:48:08.493
are responsible for determining
what becomes part of us and what

00:48:08.493 --> 00:48:11.245
stays outside.
One of the ways they can do

00:48:11.245 --> 00:48:14.300
this is if there's no space in
between these cells.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:19.973
This cell can only be an
effective barrier if there's no

00:48:19.973 --> 00:48:24.238
way to get past it.
Cells of the epithelium are

00:48:24.238 --> 00:48:28.903
actually welded to one another
through these junctions called

00:48:28.903 --> 00:48:31.250
tight junctions.
These junctions,

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.080
these red dots here are
actually made up of proteins,

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.039
some are synthesized by one
cell,

00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:42.483
some are synthesized by each
other, and they lock together to

00:48:42.483 --> 00:48:47.690
form a very tight barrier,
to form a tight junction

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.055
between the two cells.
Because of that,

00:48:51.055 --> 00:48:55.685
if I eat something that's rich
in glucose, so it has lots of

00:48:55.685 --> 00:48:59.295
sugar molecules,
the sugar molecules can't pass

00:48:59.295 --> 00:49:02.924
between the cells.
That's how tight the junctions

00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:06.513
are, not even a small molecule
like glucose can pass between

00:49:06.513 --> 00:49:08.302
them.
In order for glucose to

00:49:08.302 --> 00:49:10.570
enter our body it has to go
through the cells.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:14.640
In order for it to get inside
the cells and go through them

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.920
there have to be transporters
which specifically allow glucose

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.639
to pass into the cell and then
out into our body.

00:49:22.639 --> 00:49:27.259
There's a couple of features of
cellular physiology which are

00:49:27.259 --> 00:49:31.040
shown here.
One is that cells form tissues

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.507
that are mechanically intact,
they have mechanical integrity

00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:40.400
because they can adhere to one
another.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.984
The other is that this kind of
adherence gives the tissue a

00:49:44.984 --> 00:49:50.083
property that's useful,
in this case the property is it

00:49:50.083 --> 00:49:55.323
can serve as a barrier to
nutrients from entering our

00:49:55.323 --> 00:49:57.609
body.
The other reason why cells stay

00:49:57.609 --> 00:50:00.140
together is that they're
surrounded by a matrix that's

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.618
called extracellular matrix.
That matrix has properties that

00:50:04.618 --> 00:50:10.421
vary in different locations in
the body, but basically it's a

00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:14.000
highly hydrated or water-rich
gel.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.155
You know what Jell-o is?
Everybody knows what Jell-o is,

00:50:19.155 --> 00:50:21.496
right?
It's usually colored because

00:50:21.496 --> 00:50:25.110
there's food dye in it,
but it wouldn't be colored in

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:28.909
its natural state.
Jell-o is just a hydrated

00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:33.869
solution of collagen and it
contains a lot of water.

00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:38.806
A piece of Jell-o has probably
99% water in it,

00:50:38.806 --> 00:50:43.490
but it has a shape.
If you make Jell-o and you make

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:47.882
it right, then once it's set or
gelled, it has mechanical

00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:50.415
properties.
If you made it in a cup and you

00:50:50.415 --> 00:50:53.193
tried to pour it out it would
still have the shape of the cup

00:50:53.193 --> 00:50:56.040
when it came out.
Because of this my mother used

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.050
to make Jell-o that had fruit
suspended in it,

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.457
and the fruit doesn't sink to
the bottom like you'd expect it

00:51:02.457 --> 00:51:05.820
to sink through water,
but it stays suspended inside.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:09.030
Anybody's mother make Jell-o
with fruit in it?

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:14.010
That's how cells exist in
extracellular matrix.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:18.660
Extracellular matrix in most
tissues is abundant in collagen

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.420
and other proteins like
collagen.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:25.745
This collagen is highly
hydrated, it forms a gel that

00:51:25.745 --> 00:51:30.820
has water-like properties but it
also has solid properties.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.534
We'll talk about exactly
what a gel is later when we talk

00:51:34.534 --> 00:51:37.940
about biomechanics and cells are
suspended within it.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.788
The extracellular matrix or the
collagen gel gives the tissue

00:51:42.788 --> 00:51:46.667
integrity, and in part,
determines its mechanical

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:47.880
properties.

00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:52.186
Student:
[inaudible]

00:51:52.186 --> 00:51:53.205
Professor Mark Saltzman:
Where does the collagen

00:51:53.205 --> 00:51:55.489
come from?
The collagen is excreted by

00:51:55.489 --> 00:51:59.230
cells themselves,
so the matrix is made by cells.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:02.568
In fact, fibroblasts,
which I talked about before,

00:52:02.568 --> 00:52:06.110
are very good producers of
collagen, they produce the

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:09.040
collagen matrix within which
they live.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.981
Some cells digest collagen.
What extracellular matrix you

00:52:14.981 --> 00:52:19.395
have in any particular tissue is
there because there's a balance

00:52:19.395 --> 00:52:23.599
between it being produced by one
kind of cell and digested by

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:26.348
another,
and you're in this sort of

00:52:26.348 --> 00:52:30.460
state of dynamic equilibrium.
Okay, I'm going to stop there

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.000
and we'll continue on
Thursday.

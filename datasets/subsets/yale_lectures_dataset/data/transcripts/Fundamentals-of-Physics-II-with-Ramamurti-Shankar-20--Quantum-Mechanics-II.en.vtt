00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.369
Prof: Well,
this is just informal

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:06.970
discussion till everybody's in
here.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.690
So any questions on the subject?
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.900
What?
 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.790
Student:  Every question.
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.460
Prof: Everything.
 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.696
Okay, well, you know what,
you guys should stop and ask

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.052
more things as you go along,
because there is just no way

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:23.850
you could get all of this.
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.476
And it's a little strange and
only by talking about it,

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:31.990
you will at least know what's
going on.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.950
There's no way to make it
reasonable.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010
It's not a reasonable world out
there.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.860
I can only tell you what it is.
 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.671
I take that view;
when I teach quantum mechanics,

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.230
just tell the rules and say,
"This is what happens.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.260
This is how we calculate
things."

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.066
And whether you like the
formulas or not,

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.160
it's not my concern.
 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.500
And the fact that it doesn't
look like daily life,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.080
also not my concern,
because this is not daily life.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.010
Strange things happen.
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.037
But you have to keep me
informed on how much you're

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:06.260
following and what you are
understanding,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.629
at any stage.
 

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.363
Don't wait for this to end,
because it's not something

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:13.510
where you can go on the last day
and figure everything out.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.024
And I will try to repeat at
every stage what has gone up to

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:20.537
that point, because the whole
thing is only a few lectures,

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:21.750
maybe six or so.
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.640
I can afford to go back every
time to the beginning.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.983
But I know that it makes sense
to me, because I've seen it,

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.290
and I don't know how it sounds
to you.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.830
I have no clue.
 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.510
You know that and so you have
to speak up.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.132
You can ask any question you
want, and I will try to answer

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:44.690
you, if it's within the realm of
possibility.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.970
Okay, so what have I said so
far?

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.470
So let me summarize.
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.727
Even if you never came to last
lecture, here is what you should

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:54.620
know about the last lecture,
okay?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.920
Here's what I said.
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.981
First thing I said is,
everything is really particles,

00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.707
all things, electrons,
photons, protons,

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:07.950
neutrons.
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.056
They are all particles,
so let there be no doubt about

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:12.598
that.
 

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:17.293
By that, I mean if one of them
hits your face,

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:21.986
like an electron,
you will feel it in only one

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:24.699
tiny region, one spot.
 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.318
Electron dumps all its charge,
all its momentum,

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:32.090
all its energy to one little
part of your face.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.210
So there's nothing wavelike
about that.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.958
It's not like getting hit by a
boxing glove,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.258
which can hit your whole face.
 

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:41.632
An electron hits one dot,
or if it's an

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:46.246
electron-detecting screen,
only 1 pixel is hit by the

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:47.400
electron.
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.541
And into that pixel is given
all the charge,

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:53.389
all the momentum,
all the energy of that

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:54.340
electron.
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.960
That's exactly what particles
do.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.157
So when you encounter an
electron, it is simply a

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:00.889
particle.
 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.340
So where does the problem come
in?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.610
Where does the quantum
mechanics come in?

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.599
It comes in when you do the
famous double slit experiment.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.218
That's the key.
 

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:14.620
The entire quantum mystery is
in the double slit.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.477
Part of the resolution is in
the double slit,

00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:19.051
but the rest are a little more
difficult, and I'll try to tell

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:19.389
you.
 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.152
First I want to tell you what
goes wrong with Newtonian

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:23.990
mechanics.
 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.674
After all, if everything is a
particle, what's the big deal,

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:27.628
what's the problem?
 

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:30.180
The double slit experiment is a
problem.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.593
That's what puts the nail on
the coffin for Newtonian

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:36.680
physics, and here it is in the
basic version.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.710
You've got two slits.
 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.270
By the way, I'm going to call
the particle the electron.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.079
They're all doing the same
thing, so what applies to one,

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.780
applies to all of them.
 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.491
There is a source,
like an electron gun,

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.680
that emits electrons.
 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.555
In the old days,
televisions had the electron

00:03:57.555 --> 00:03:58.220
gun.
 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.269
And the gun emits the
electrons, they go and hit the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.917
screen, they make a little dot,
and then the dot moves around,

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.008
and you see your favorite show.
 

00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:10.740
Okay, this is the electron gun,
and the electron gun has been

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.158
engineered to send electrons off
a definite momentum.

00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:16.613
That you can get by
accelerating the electrons over

00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:18.774
a definite potential,
and the gain of so many

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:21.180
electron volts will turn into
kinetic energy.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.386
As for direction,
if this gun is really far away

00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:26.745
to the left,
in principle 1 mile,

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:30.817
then the only way electrons are
going to go 1 mile and hit the

00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:34.488
screen is they're all basically
moving in the horizontal

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:35.490
direction.
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.329
Then you put a row of detectors
in the back, which will detect

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.480
electrons.
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.709
Then this is slit 1 and this is
slit 2.

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.319
You block slit 1.
 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.586
In fact, let me say the
following thing:

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:56.860
what do we really know when we
do the experiment?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.622
Once in a while this gun will
emit an electron,

00:04:59.622 --> 00:05:03.226
and we know it's emitted the
electron, because it will recoil

00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:05.389
one way, just like a gun,
rifle.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.399
It will recoil.
 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:09.769
That's when we know the
electron left.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.175
Then we don't know anything,
and suddenly,

00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:15.750
one of these guys says click.
 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.819
That means electron's arrived
here.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.250
This is what we really know.
 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.353
Everything else you say about
the electron is conjecture at

00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:25.050
this point.
 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.410
You know it was here,
you know it was there.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.620
The question is,
what was it doing in between?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.291
Now if you say,
"Look, things cannot go

00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:37.336
from here to there,
except by following some path,

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.759
I don't know what path it
is."

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.209
Maybe if it's an ordinary
particle,

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:43.514
like a Newtonian particle,
it will take some straight

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:45.028
line,
hit that slit,

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:48.420
or go through that slit and
arrive here.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.177
So you might say,
"I don't know the

00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:56.608
trajectory, but it's got to be
some trajectory,

00:05:56.608 --> 00:06:01.040
maybe like that,
or maybe like that."

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.615
So the electron takes some path
and you can label the path as

00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:10.519
either through slit 1 or through
slit 2.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:13.740
Okay, now here is the problem.
 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.000
Suppose I do the experiment
with slit 2 blocked,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.199
so you cannot even get through
this one,

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.850
and I sit at a certain location
for a certain amount of time,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.759
maybe 1 hour and I see how many
electrons come,

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.040
and I get 5 electrons,
with only 1 slit open.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.045
And if I move that observation
point, I get some pattern,

00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:37.192
pretty dull,
looking like that,

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:40.769
and I'm going to call it
I_1.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.978
That's the count,
as a function of position up

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:48.160
and down that wall of detectors.
 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.781
Then I repeat the experiment
with this guy closed and that

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:59.009
guy open, and I get another
count, looks like that.

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.088
Now I'm going to pick a
location.

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:04.394
These are not drawn to scale or
anything, so I'm not responsible

00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:05.338
for any of that.
 

00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:08.341
Maybe I'll at least show you
one thing, which is pretty

00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:09.009
important.
 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.028
This graph will be big in front
of the second slit,

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:15.120
which is somewhere here.
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.860
It will look like that.
 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.504
So I get I_1
when 1 is open and I get

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:24.120
I_2 when 2 is
open.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.720
This is I_1,
this is I_2.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.192
Now I'm going to open the two
slits and I'm going to pick a

00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:36.269
particular location.
 

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:37.190
It doesn't happen everywhere.
 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.259
I'm going to pick one location
called x.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.937
Where I used to get 5 electrons
per hour with one thing open,

00:07:44.937 --> 00:07:49.149
and 5 electrons per hour with
the second thing open.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:54.920
Now I want to open both and
ask, what will I get?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.023
In Newtonian mechanics,
there's only one possible

00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:00.545
answer to that question,
and that is 10,

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:04.360
because we've got 5 this way
and you've got 5 that way.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.684
And you open both,
whoever is going this way will

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:09.137
keep going that way;
whoever is going this way will

00:08:09.137 --> 00:08:10.110
keep going this way.
 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.519
They will add up to give you 10.
 

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.730
Now I told you,
some people may say,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.293
"Well, maybe it's not 10,
because with both slits open,

00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:20.079
maybe someone from here can
collide with someone from there.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:21.709
How do you know that will not
happen?"

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.290
So I'm saying,
do the experiment with such a

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.589
feeble beam of electrons,
there's only one electron at a

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:29.149
time in the whole lab.
 

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:31.100
It's not going to collide with
itself.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.960
Then you wait long enough,
and you have to get 5 5 = 10.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.062
And what I'm telling you is
that if you go to the location

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:43.230
marked x,
where you've got 5 with each

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.759
one open, when you open both,
you will get 0.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:49.440
You don't get anything.
 

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.230
That is a great mystery.
 

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.139
That is the end of Newtonian
physics.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:56.904
And I told you that something
like that never happens in your

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:57.720
daily life.
 

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.070
I gave an example with machine
guns.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.080
This is a machine gun.
 

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.777
This is a concrete wall with 2
holes in it, and there's some

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:07.288
target here, you.
 

00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:10.289
And then you see how many are
coming through this and how many

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:11.570
are coming through that.
 

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.429
Then you go there and you wait.
 

00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:15.120
And both are open.
 

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.678
Somehow, nothing comes.
 

00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:21.509
With the second hole in the
wall, you are safe.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:23.600
With one hole in the wall,
you're not safe.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.778
That can never happen with
bullets.

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:29.820
So these electrons are not
following any path,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.239
because the minute you commit
yourself to saying it follows

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.240
one path,
either through this one or

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.820
that, you cannot avoid the fact
that with both of them open,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.610
the intensity with 1 2 has to =
I_1

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.870
I_2.
 

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.480
That's the Newtonian prediction.
 

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.373
And I_1
I_2 gives you 5

00:09:48.373 --> 00:09:50.320
5 = 10 here and you get 0.
 

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.394
In other places,
instead of 10,

00:09:53.394 --> 00:09:55.240
you will get 20.
 

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.014
Some places you get more,
but more dramatic thing is

00:09:59.014 --> 00:10:02.269
where you get less,
where you get nothing.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:05.200
Therefore you abandon the
notion that electrons have any

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.000
trajectories.
 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.480
You don't want to abandon it,
but you have to,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.179
because that assumption,
which is very reasonable,

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:13.330
just doesn't agree with
experiment.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.789
Then you say,
"Okay, what should I do?

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:16.649
Newtonian mechanics is wrong.
 

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.759
What's going to take its
place?"

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:22.230
To find that,
you have to move away from this

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.543
x and move up and down
this row here and see what you

00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:28.070
get, and I think I told you what
you get.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.480
You get a pattern that looks
like this.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.373
So the real I1 2 looks like
this: it's got ups and downs and

00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:38.700
ups and downs.
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.570
And let's say these downs
really correspond to 0.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.416
That means nobody comes here,
a lot of them come here,

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.940
no one comes here,
a few come here and so on.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.850
That's what you find.
 

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.037
I'm just telling you what
happens when you do the

00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:51.629
experiment.
 

00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:54.671
So you put yourself in the
place of a person who did the

00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:55.389
experiment.
 

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:58.886
You thought of moving away from
that point x and you plot

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:01.830
it, it makes no sense in the
language of particles.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.629
But this is such a familiar
pattern.

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:08.750
If you're a trained physicist,
which you guys are,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.447
you will say,
"Hey, this reminds me of

00:11:10.447 --> 00:11:13.145
this wave interference,
with water waves or sound waves

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:13.889
or any waves.
 

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:16.620
" Obviously there's some
wavelength.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.455
The minute you give me
wavelength and a slit

00:11:19.455 --> 00:11:22.288
separation, I can calculate this
pattern.

00:11:22.288 --> 00:11:24.639
dsinθ
= l and whatnot,

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.450
and from that
sinθ,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.330
where you get a minimum or a
maximum,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.389
and if there's a certain
separation to the screen,

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.904
you can find the precise
location of these maxima or

00:11:32.904 --> 00:11:33.350
minima.
 

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.981
Or given the maxima and minima,
you can work back and find the

00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:38.970
wavelength.
 

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.539
And the wavelength happens to
be some number called

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:47.470
ℏ, which is 10^(-34)
joule seconds,

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.029
divided by the momentum.
 

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:53.960
p is the momentum.
 

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.249
In other words,
you find that if you send more

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:59.038
energetic electrons,
accelerate them through bigger

00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:00.538
voltage,
increase the p,

00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:04.149
l goes down,
the pattern gets squeezed.

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:06.190
You slow down the electrons,
p reduces,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.600
l increases,
the pattern spreads out,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.080
and the dependence on momentum
is inversely proportional to

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.740
momentum.
 

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.312
And you fool around and find
out the coefficient of

00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:17.437
proportionality,
which people used to call

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:20.102
h in the old days is now
written as 2p

00:12:20.102 --> 00:12:22.464
xℏ,
but it doesn't matter,

00:12:22.464 --> 00:12:23.649
it's some constant.
 

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:28.960
And the number is 10^(-34).
 

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.635
So you can successfully
reproduce this pattern,

00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:38.720
but what does it tell you about
what's going on?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.048
What good is that pattern?
 

00:12:40.048 --> 00:12:43.250
The pattern tells you that if
you repeat the experiment with

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.452
this electron gun a million
times or a billion times and you

00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:51.889
plotted the histogram patiently,
the histogram will eventually

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:55.440
fill out and take this shape.
 

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.331
So this wave is not the wave
associated with a huge stream of

00:12:59.331 --> 00:13:00.110
electrons.
 

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.629
A single electron in the lab is
controlled by this wave.

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:06.682
You need a whole wave for 1
electron, so it's obviously not

00:13:06.682 --> 00:13:07.840
a wave of electrons.
 

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.460
It's not a wave of charge,
like the wave of water.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.918
It's a mathematical function
and you are drawn to it,

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.923
because the only way you know
how to get this wiggly graph is

00:13:16.923 --> 00:13:20.230
to take something with definite
wavelength and let it interfere.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.808
So you're forced to think about
this wave.

00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:26.958
And the intensity of the wave,
the brightness if you like,

00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.090
the square of its height,
gives you what?

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.910
Gives you the graph you will
get if you repeat the experiment

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.740
many times.
 

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.769
And what does it mean for the
individual trial?

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:41.220
What does it mean for the
millionth one electron?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.666
For the millionth one electron,
it gives you the odds of where

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:48.288
it will land on that screen,
okay?

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:50.048
You can never tell exactly
where it will be.

00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:52.610
You can tell what the odds are,
and the only way to test the

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.038
statistical theory is to do the
experiment many times.

00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:57.562
And if you do it,
it works, and it seems to work

00:13:57.562 --> 00:13:59.154
for everything,
for electrons,

00:13:59.154 --> 00:14:00.360
for protons,
for photons,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.686
whatever it is,
the wavelength and momentum are

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:07.320
connected in this fashion.
 

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.333
So this wave is forced upon us,
and it gives you the odds of

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.580
finding the electron somewhere.
 

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.289
And we say that the
probability-- I'll be a little

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:19.607
more precise in a minute on what
I mean by the probability to

00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:22.748
find it at a location x,
but let's just say,

00:14:22.748 --> 00:14:25.590
if you draw the graph of
Y^(2),

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.668
wherever it is big,
the probability is larger;

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.649
wherever it is small,
probability is small;

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:33.480
wherever it is 0,
probability is 0.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.027
So there seems to be a function
whose amplitude or whose square

00:14:37.027 --> 00:14:38.629
gives you the probability.
 

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:42.168
That function is called the
wave function,

00:14:42.168 --> 00:14:46.481
and we know it exists,
because it's the only way to

00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:50.279
calculate the result of this
experiment.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:55.327
Once you tell me that the fate
of a particle is controlled by a

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.768
wave,
you're immediately led to some

00:14:57.768 --> 00:15:00.557
other conclusions,
so I'm going to tell you what

00:15:00.557 --> 00:15:01.110
they are.
 

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:07.080
First conclusion is this:
if I make a single slit,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.720
let's call this the x
direction,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.139
let's call this the y
direction,

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:17.591
and I'm sending a bunch of
particles in the x

00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:23.149
direction with some momentum
p_0.

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:27.380
In Newtonian mechanics,
I can manufacture for you an

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.115
electron of known momentum and
known position,

00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:34.019
or known to arbitrary accuracy.
 

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:38.509
If Dx is the
uncertainty in my position,

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:41.269
and Dp is the
uncertainty in momentum,

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:44.029
I can make each of them as
small as I like.

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:48.870
So here's an actual practical
way to prepare such a state.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.498
If I say, "Give me an
electron of known position,

00:15:51.498 --> 00:15:53.779
known momentum,"
here's what I will do.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:56.370
I will take a slit with a very
tiny hole in it.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.340
The width of that hole is
d, and whoever comes out

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.388
on the other side,
what can I say about that

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:04.308
particle?
 

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:07.639
Its position has an uncertainty
of order d,

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:11.307
because if it was not--I'm
sorry, Dy now,

00:16:11.307 --> 00:16:14.230
because this is the y
direction.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.379
Right?
 

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:19.294
Anything who came out of hole
right after it had to have a y

00:16:19.294 --> 00:16:22.149
position, whose known to within
d.

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:24.883
It's got to come anywhere
within the slit,

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:25.950
but that's it.
 

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.835
So that is how I have prepared
for you, that's how we filter

00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.450
electrons of definite position.
 

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.589
And you can make
Dy as small as you

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:34.639
like by making the slit as thin
as you like.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.288
What about its momentum?
 

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:38.696
If you had a momentum
p_0 in the

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:41.557
x direction,
no momentum in the y

00:16:41.557 --> 00:16:44.057
direction,
therefore py was

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:46.308
strictly 0,
no uncertainty.

00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:49.442
Dpy is 0 and the
fellow I catch here is moving

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:52.469
horizontally with that momentum
p_0 whose

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.700
y position is within
d,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.570
and I can make the d as
small as I like.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.519
This is Newtonian physics.
 

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.658
But we have now learned that
the fate of the particle is not

00:17:02.658 --> 00:17:03.669
in its own hands.
 

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:07.000
It's contained in this wave.
 

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.894
So what should I do in this
context to find out what it will

00:17:11.894 --> 00:17:12.308
do?
 

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:17.142
Any idea what I should do to
find out what will happen in

00:17:17.142 --> 00:17:20.680
this experiment,
given what we learned?

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.528
Yes?
 

00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:25.338
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:25.338 --> 00:17:28.528
Prof: Right,
but how will I calculate what

00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:30.720
will happen in this experiment?
 

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.680
What will decide?
 

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.430
Yes?
 

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:40.549
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:42.484
Prof: Yes,
this is one hole,

00:17:42.484 --> 00:17:45.660
and a light beam is coming from
the left--

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.910
I mean, a wave is coming from
the left,

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.180
and if the particle has
momentum p_0,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.615
it's got some wavelength,
which is 2p

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:57.009
ℏ/p_0.
 

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:00.859
But if you want to know what
will happen on the other side of

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:04.068
this slit, I have to find the
fate of that wave.

00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:07.348
Yes, you can put a screen,
but what will I see on a

00:18:07.348 --> 00:18:07.940
screen?
 

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.190
Will the wave just hit this
region?

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.538
You know it will spread out
from diffraction.

00:18:14.538 --> 00:18:17.670
I've told you,
the light will spread out.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.630
There are tiny wiggles we
ignore, and this point,

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.410
where you get most of the
action, that angle,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.790
θ,
satisfies dsinθ=

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.059
l.
 

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:30.430
This is just wave theory.
 

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.400
That's when you can pair up the
points in the slit,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.502
in the hole,
to things shifting,

00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:39.222
differing by half a wavelength,
so for every one I can find a

00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:41.920
partner that cancels it,
you will get 0 here.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.878
Beyond that,
you may get a few more rises,

00:18:44.878 --> 00:18:48.200
but it's pretty much dead
outside this cone.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:54.688
That means you will observe
this particle anywhere in this

00:18:54.688 --> 00:18:56.509
angular width.
 

00:18:56.509 --> 00:19:01.741
Now a particle cannot go from
this slit to there unless it had

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.858
a momentum, which had a
component in the y

00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:07.058
direction.
 

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:09.848
You cannot get there from here,
unless you have y momentum.

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:14.910
It's the y momentum is
uncertain to within that cone.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.028
So what's the uncertainty in
the y momentum?

00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:20.663
For a vector of length
p_0 when it

00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:23.506
gets shifted by an angle
Dθ or by an angle

00:19:23.506 --> 00:19:25.384
θ,
it is just

00:19:25.384 --> 00:19:27.858
p_0xθ.
 

00:19:27.858 --> 00:19:31.343
Or, if you like,
precisely, p_0

00:19:31.343 --> 00:19:33.269
times sinθ.
 

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:37.509
But p_0
sinθ,

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.710
sinθ
is controlled by

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.910
dsinθ
= l,

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:48.720
so this is l/d.
 

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.529
But l is 2p
ℏ/p_0 x d.

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:59.324
You cancel that,
you find D py X d =

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:02.838
2pℏ.
 

00:20:02.838 --> 00:20:07.967
That means D py D y is
roughly--forget the

00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:12.970
2p's--of our
ℏ.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.199
So you should understand this
much completely without any

00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:20.220
doubt: if the future of the
particle,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.670
the fate of the particle,
is controlled by the wave,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.382
you try to narrow the location
of the particle by making the

00:20:25.382 --> 00:20:28.759
hole smaller and smaller,
the wave fans out more and more.

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:30.450
That's just wave theory.
 

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.900
People knew this about waves
hundreds of years back.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.435
What is novel is that this wave
is going to tell you where the

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:37.769
particle will end up.
 

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:40.288
This wave is going to control
the odds of where the particle

00:20:40.288 --> 00:20:43.058
will end up,
and the odds are pretty much

00:20:43.058 --> 00:20:46.101
concentrated in this cone,
not of 0 opening angle,

00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:48.476
but an angle θ,
so that dsinθ

00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:49.338
= l.
 

00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:54.650
l in turn is connected to the
momentum of the particle.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.029
This is where the uncertainty
principle comes in.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:02.490
What Heisenberg said is,
"You had in your mind the

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.887
classical notion that you can
have a particle of known

00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:07.940
position and known momentum.
 

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.960
Let me see you produce that
particle.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.653
So you try to do it by putting
a slit and catching guys with a

00:21:13.653 --> 00:21:17.000
very narrow range in y,
but now you find out that the

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.348
momentum gets broader and
broader,

00:21:19.348 --> 00:21:22.192
and that's the result of the
wave associated with the

00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:22.740
project.
 

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.160
" It was not in the
Newtonian picture.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.358
Yes?
 

00:21:25.358 --> 00:21:28.836
Student:  Why with the
single slit, like you've drawn

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:32.078
there, do you get the little
wiggle at the outside--?

00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:33.731
Prof: You mean,
why would it have those

00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:34.098
wiggles?
 

00:21:34.098 --> 00:21:39.230
Okay, so if I look at the
single slit, I could think of

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.890
many little point sources.
 

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.491
In the forward direction,
if you go very far,

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:48.160
so you treat them as roughly
parallel, they are all in step.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.220
You've got a big maximum.
 

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.942
In another direction where this
difference is l,

00:21:53.942 --> 00:21:58.300
dsinθ = l,
this guy and this guy are

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.519
differing by l/2.
 

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:03.136
Student:  So you're
assuming the slit is large

00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:05.048
enough for them to do that
________.

00:22:05.048 --> 00:22:08.844
Prof: These are little
mathematical dots inside the

00:22:08.844 --> 00:22:09.308
slit.
 

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:13.739
You know, when you make a slit,
every point on the slit looks

00:22:13.739 --> 00:22:17.430
like a source of light,
a point source of light.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.913
They are not really light
bulbs, but if you make any hole

00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:21.864
in the wall, a light comes
through that hole,

00:22:21.864 --> 00:22:23.548
looks like it's a source of
light.

00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:26.608
I'm taking every point on the
hole to be a source of light.

00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:30.561
And what I'm saying is,
there is a direction in which

00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:33.982
it will cancel,
but if you go a little further

00:22:33.982 --> 00:22:36.720
out, it won't cancel completely.
 

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.555
This is the direction for
perfect cancelation,

00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:40.391
where I can pair them,
this one with this one,

00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:41.859
that one to that one,
and so on.

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:43.538
They pair to give 0.
 

00:22:43.538 --> 00:22:46.467
But if you move further up,
you no longer cancel

00:22:46.467 --> 00:22:48.433
completely,
but you don't add perfectly

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:49.739
either,
so things will get better,

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:52.420
then they'll get worse again,
and better and worse and so on.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.359
So that's the origin of that
pattern.

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:55.779
Yes?
 

00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:57.796
Student:  So you're
saying this is the first

00:22:57.796 --> 00:22:58.200
minimum.
 

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.329
After that, it would increase
_______.

00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:00.048
Prof: Yes.
 

00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:03.643
For a single slit diffraction,
the big thing in the middle is

00:23:03.643 --> 00:23:05.259
pretty much all you have.
 

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:10.523
It's not like double slit
experiment with two holes,

00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:14.548
where you get many times the
pattern.

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:17.460
That's because--let's
understand why that is true.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.720
Here, if these two differ by 1
wavelength, they don't differ at

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.230
all.
 

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.890
I can find another angle where
they differ by 2 wavelengths.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.358
They don't differ at all.
 

00:23:27.358 --> 00:23:29.642
There's only 2 sources,
so you can engineer them to

00:23:29.642 --> 00:23:32.608
differ by either 1 wavelength or
2 wavelength or 3 wavelengths.

00:23:32.608 --> 00:23:36.656
Here in a single slit,
each point is like a source of

00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:37.279
light.
 

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.230
You got them all to agree.
 

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.308
You can get them to agree only
in the forward direction.

00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:44.211
In any other direction,
you can get them to neutralize

00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:46.950
each other, but never for
perfect reinforcement.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.736
So you cannot get it more
than--this is the only real

00:23:49.736 --> 00:23:50.539
maximum here.
 

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:51.769
Everything else is tiny.
 

00:23:51.769 --> 00:23:52.858
Yes?
 

00:23:52.858 --> 00:23:55.582
Student:  Why can't you
do the same trick with the

00:23:55.582 --> 00:23:58.450
double slit, where each of the
one slits has its _______?

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.511
Prof: No,
in double slit,

00:23:59.511 --> 00:24:01.911
what's happening is,
we take--in double slit,

00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:05.941
the number d I used in
double slit was not the size of

00:24:05.941 --> 00:24:09.002
a slit,
but the space in between the

00:24:09.002 --> 00:24:10.000
slit, okay?
 

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.163
So there I took the size of
every slit to be vanishingly

00:24:14.163 --> 00:24:14.769
small.
 

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:18.520
That means a light coming out
of this slit spreads out

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.140
completely in all directions,
okay?

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.108
It's as if this packet became
that broad.

00:24:26.108 --> 00:24:32.098
Likewise a light from this one,
we are still in the first

00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:34.558
maximum of that slit.
 

00:24:34.558 --> 00:24:38.404
So you've got to understand,
in a single slit experiment of

00:24:38.404 --> 00:24:41.920
diffraction, the slit size is
what you are varying.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.518
In a double slit experiment,
the slit is taken to be

00:24:44.518 --> 00:24:47.318
mathematically point like,
so it fans out completely.

00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:50.442
It's the interference between
those two point sources that

00:24:50.442 --> 00:24:51.318
you're adding.
 

00:24:51.318 --> 00:24:54.594
They can add and cancel,
add and cancel,

00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:58.538
many, many times as you move
along this line.

00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:01.407
Okay, so what we learn is it's
when you combine waves and

00:25:01.407 --> 00:25:04.788
particles and go back and forth
that you run into the situation.

00:25:04.788 --> 00:25:08.410
So you cannot make a state of
perfect momentum.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.480
By the way, I said one thing,
I thought about it,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.808
which is incorrect,
which is, in the microscope,

00:25:13.808 --> 00:25:16.598
I said if you want to locate
the position of an electron in a

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:19.654
microscope,
take a microscope with an

00:25:19.654 --> 00:25:24.368
opening, and electron is
somewhere on this line.

00:25:24.368 --> 00:25:26.990
I said you're shining light
down here.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:33.083
It hits the electron,
but it goes in through the slit

00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:35.308
by spreading out.
 

00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:39.844
So the photon that came in goes
into the eyepiece with a certain

00:25:39.844 --> 00:25:42.220
uncertainty in its final angle.
 

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.500
That means we know the incoming
momentum, but we don't know the

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.298
outgoing momentum of the photon.
 

00:25:47.298 --> 00:25:50.118
The lens picks up everything
inside that cone.

00:25:50.118 --> 00:25:52.743
That means we don't know how
much momentum it gave to the

00:25:52.743 --> 00:25:53.259
electron.
 

00:25:53.259 --> 00:25:56.730
It gives an indefinite amount
of momentum to the electron.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.845
Therefore the x momentum
of the electron is uncertain by

00:25:59.845 --> 00:26:01.955
that little shape,
the conical shape of the

00:26:01.955 --> 00:26:02.608
momentum.
 

00:26:02.608 --> 00:26:05.511
And if you do the uncertainty
principle argument,

00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:08.413
you'll again find
DxDp is

00:26:08.413 --> 00:26:09.200
h, h.
 

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.770
Now what I don't like about my
experimental setup is that I had

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.269
the incoming light also coming
from inside the microscope,

00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:20.577
but that means incoming light,
when it comes through this hole

00:26:20.577 --> 00:26:24.170
here,
will itself spread.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.836
Then it will hit this guy,
and that will go to the

00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:26.210
aperture.
 

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.930
That will spread some more.
 

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.048
This uncertainty in incoming
momentum is unnecessary.

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:33.905
We can do better than that,
because in other words,

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:37.105
when the light is picked up,
it is picked up by this tiny

00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:37.618
hole.
 

00:26:37.618 --> 00:26:39.890
There's no reason it should
also come from the tiny hole.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.247
It can come from a source far
away, say on the other side,

00:26:43.247 --> 00:26:46.721
so that it is a well defined
direction, it's not diffracting

00:26:46.721 --> 00:26:47.368
at all.
 

00:26:47.368 --> 00:26:50.009
So I want it to come in through
a very broad hole,

00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:53.026
so it's got well defined
direction, so the light here has

00:26:53.026 --> 00:26:54.048
known momentum.
 

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:57.160
It hits the electron and goes
into the microscope.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.549
It is the final momentum of the
photon I don't know.

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:03.140
And I cannot make it better.
 

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.932
If I make it better,
I've got to open this eyepiece

00:27:05.932 --> 00:27:06.380
a lot.
 

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.188
If I open the eyepiece a lot,
I don't know where I caught

00:27:09.188 --> 00:27:09.740
this guy.
 

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.880
So again the problem between
taking a very tiny eyepiece,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.132
so that if I see a flicker,
I know the electron was in

00:27:15.132 --> 00:27:18.040
front of it,
but the light coming from the

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.410
reflected electron fans out more
and more.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.263
Okay, so anyway,
this is the uncertainty

00:27:24.263 --> 00:27:28.728
principle and the uncertainty
principle told us something very

00:27:28.728 --> 00:27:29.900
interesting.
 

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.696
I asked you,
what can be the function here

00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:36.859
that produces this interference
pattern in the double slit?

00:27:36.859 --> 00:27:38.608
We know the wavelength.
 

00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:43.750
Wavelength was 2p
ℏ/p.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:51.025
And you know from basic physics
that a function like cosine

00:27:51.025 --> 00:27:56.420
2px/l has got
wavelength l.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.279
So let's put in the formula for
l here.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:02.940
You get cosine
2px.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.420
l is 2pℏ
/p.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:15.505
Cancel the 2 p's,
you get A cosine

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:18.740
px/ℏ.
 

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.438
That function,
when you throw it at a double

00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:23.492
slit,
will form two little wavelets,

00:28:23.492 --> 00:28:27.561
and they will interfere,
that produce an interference

00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:30.480
pattern of the type you want.
 

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.280
Do you understand that the
experiment only showed you

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.519
there's a wavelength.
 

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:38.079
It did not tell you what the
actual function is?

00:28:38.079 --> 00:28:39.058
That's very, very important.
 

00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:41.480
When Young did the experiment
with the double slit,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.903
he found the oscillations and
he could read off the

00:28:43.903 --> 00:28:44.630
wavelength.
 

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.288
It's just geometry.
 

00:28:46.288 --> 00:28:47.890
But he didn't know what was
oscillating.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.340
He didn't know there's an
electric and magnetic field

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.519
underneath all of that.
 

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:54.066
But you can always read out the
wavelength without knowing

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:54.868
what's going on.
 

00:28:54.868 --> 00:28:57.068
Likewise, we have the
wavelength.

00:28:57.068 --> 00:29:00.143
We know it comes from a
function with a well defined

00:29:00.143 --> 00:29:03.700
wavelength, so I make my first
guess to be this function.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.039
But I told you what was wrong
with this choice.

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:10.890
You guys remember that?
 

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.808
I said this function violates
the uncertainty principle.

00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:18.387
The uncertainty principle says
if you know the position to an

00:29:18.387 --> 00:29:21.285
accuracy Dx,
and if you know the momentum to

00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:25.346
accuracy Dp,
the product must be at least as

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:29.970
big as hx some
number of order 1.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:34.798
We have taken the particles to
have well defined momentum.

00:29:34.798 --> 00:29:38.578
If they have well defined
momentum, Dp is 0.

00:29:38.578 --> 00:29:42.210
Dp is 0,
Dx is infinity.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:47.240
Now I told the square of the
wave function is the probability

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.432
to find it somewhere,
and you have no idea where it

00:29:51.432 --> 00:29:52.019
is.
 

00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:56.340
In other words,
a particle of perfectly known

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.269
momentum has totally unknown
position.

00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:04.517
So the probability should look
flat, Y^(2) should

00:30:04.517 --> 00:30:05.338
look flat.
 

00:30:05.338 --> 00:30:09.277
But the Y^(2),
due to cosine,

00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:11.338
of course does this.
 

00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:14.924
It prefers some locations to
another, but you're not supposed

00:30:14.924 --> 00:30:18.750
to have any preference for any
x, so we have a problem.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:24.300
How do I put in a wavelength
into a function whose square is

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.960
flat?
 

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.358
That's the problem we have.
 

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:30.175
When you think about it,
you realize your trigonometric

00:30:30.175 --> 00:30:31.950
functions will not do the trick.
 

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.930
If they have a wavelength,
their square is not flat.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.450
The square is also oscillating.
 

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.865
But then what came to the
rescue is the following

00:30:39.865 --> 00:30:41.707
function,
not a cosine but

00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:44.608
Ae^(ipx)
^(/ℏ),

00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:48.910
rather than cosine
xp/ℏ.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.358
Look at this function.
 

00:30:51.358 --> 00:30:52.847
This function,
I've told you many,

00:30:52.847 --> 00:30:55.104
many times, if you don't know
your complex numbers,

00:30:55.104 --> 00:30:57.088
you're definitely going to have
trouble.

00:30:57.088 --> 00:31:02.893
It looks like a vector of
length A and angle

00:31:02.893 --> 00:31:06.838
θ,
which is px/â„ .

00:31:06.838 --> 00:31:10.410
As you vary x,
this x changes and this

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.838
will rotate round,
but as it rotates the amplitude

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:16.539
of this complex number,
absolute value of

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:19.634
Y^(2),
which is Y times

00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:23.405
Y', which is A--
I'm taking A to be real

00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:26.346
here,
so A' is this,

00:31:26.346 --> 00:31:31.598
times e^(ipx/â„ ),
times e^( −ipx/â„ ).

00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:35.720
That cancels out,
you just get A^(2).

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.075
In other words,
the complex number describing

00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:41.019
the wave function changes in
phase but not amplitude.

00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:44.608
It's the amplitude that gives
the probability.

00:31:44.608 --> 00:31:48.118
Now there is no problem with
this guy having a wavelength,

00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:50.460
because this oscillates in
x.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.974
Its real part and imaginary
part both oscillate,

00:31:52.974 --> 00:31:56.240
but the square of the real the
imaginary square is 1 [A^2].

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.970
That's why the amplitude
doesn't change.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.384
So we are driven now to the
very interesting result that the

00:32:04.384 --> 00:32:08.875
wave function for a particle of
definite momentum p is

00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:09.548
this.
 

00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:12.068
So this is a very important
lesson.

00:32:12.068 --> 00:32:15.006
Let me label this function by
label p to tell you,

00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:17.313
"Hey, I'm not talking
about any old wave

00:32:17.313 --> 00:32:18.308
function."
 

00:32:18.308 --> 00:32:20.720
This guy has a definite
momentum p.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.152
Its wave function looks like
e^( ipx/ℏ) times

00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:33.848
any number A you want in
front of it.

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:35.890
That's a very important thing
to know.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.655
This is called a plane wave,
and a plane wave with a

00:32:38.655 --> 00:32:41.800
p right where it is
describes a particle of momentum

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.700
p in particle mechanics.
 

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.531
And I told you particles of
momentum p are

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:47.298
everywhere.
 

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.910
Every machine produces them,
every accelerator produces

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.230
them, and if you want to
describe them in quantum

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.548
mechanics, you have to know
complex numbers.

00:32:54.548 --> 00:32:57.633
There's just no way you can get
a real answer to our

00:32:57.633 --> 00:32:58.480
predicament.
 

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.180
It's complex.
 

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.304
So that's roughly where I left
you, and I want to remind you of

00:33:06.304 --> 00:33:10.353
a few other things,
this further discussion of the

00:33:10.353 --> 00:33:12.420
result we have,
okay?

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.040
The discussion is,
if the world is really this

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.710
messed up at the microscopic
level, why do I think it's the

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.009
world I see in the macroscopic
level?

00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:25.720
Where are all these
oscillations?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.032
Why is it that when there's a
concrete wall,

00:33:28.032 --> 00:33:30.670
making another hole is bad for
me and not good?

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.390
Why do all these things happen?
 

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.950
Why do I think particles have
definite momentum and position?

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.790
Why do I think that if I make a
hole in the wall and I send a

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.761
beam,
the beam will go on the other

00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:44.055
side of the wall with a shape
precisely like the shape of the

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.608
hole,
no spreading out?

00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:50.740
It all has to do with the size
of the object.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.809
The laws of physics are always
quantum mechanical laws,

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:56.993
but when you apply it to an
elephant, you get one kind of

00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:58.291
answer;
when you apply it to an

00:33:58.291 --> 00:33:59.519
electron, you get another kind
of answer.

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:02.588
You don't have separate laws
for big and small things.

00:34:02.588 --> 00:34:05.068
The real question is,
how do these very same laws,

00:34:05.068 --> 00:34:06.960
when applied to big things--by
big things,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.179
I mean things you see in daily
life--

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.829
give the impression that the
world is Newtonian?

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:16.320
So let's look at the double
slit experiment.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.500
Here's a double slit and we are
told, "Send something.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.349
See what happens on the other
side."

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:24.913
And the prediction is that you
get these oscillations,

00:34:24.913 --> 00:34:28.342
with the peculiar property that
with two holes open,

00:34:28.342 --> 00:34:30.829
you don't get anything
somewhere.

00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:33.286
We don't seem to see that in
daily life, and you can ask,

00:34:33.286 --> 00:34:34.559
"Why is that so?"
 

00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:39.663
Well, you remember that the
condition for the next minimum

00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:42.617
is like
dsinθ,

00:34:42.617 --> 00:34:44.230
is l/2.
 

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:51.186
So if θ is very
small, it's like θ

00:34:51.186 --> 00:34:57.199
xd is l/2,
or θ = l/d.

00:34:57.199 --> 00:35:00.525
That's the angle you've got to
go through from the central

00:35:00.525 --> 00:35:01.110
maximum.
 

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.710
That's the central maximum to
the first minimum here.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:10.869
That tiny angle is given by
l/d.

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:15.005
The reason you don't see the
oscillations is when you put in

00:35:15.005 --> 00:35:17.739
the values for l and
d.

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:21.090
Let's pick a reasonable value
for this angle θ.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.010
Do you understand what
θ is?

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:26.190
In that maximum,
there are some oscillations.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.920
I want to go to the first
minimum near that.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.168
The distance between these two
is roughly the spacing between

00:35:33.168 --> 00:35:35.280
maxima and minima,
maxima and minima.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.539
That angle is l/2.
 

00:35:37.539 --> 00:35:41.492
l is
2pℏ over

00:35:41.492 --> 00:35:44.880
the momentum and that is
d.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.192
In a microscopic world,
p is mv,

00:35:48.192 --> 00:35:52.166
and let's take an object of
mass 1 kilogram moving at 1

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:55.699
meter per second and a slit hole
is 1 meter.

00:35:55.699 --> 00:35:56.800
The size of the slit is 1 meter.
 

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.429
Put everything equal to 1 for a
typical estimate.

00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:10.719
You find this number is
10^(-34) radians.

00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:14.871
That means that the angular
difference between the maximum

00:36:14.871 --> 00:36:19.094
and the minimum and the maximum
and the minimum is 10^(-34)

00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:19.969
radians.
 

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:24.143
What that means is,
if you put a screen 1 meter

00:36:24.143 --> 00:36:25.985
away,
the distance between one

00:36:25.985 --> 00:36:28.869
maximum and the next maximum or
one minimum to the next minimum

00:36:28.869 --> 00:36:33.266
and so on,
that spacing will be 10^(-34)

00:36:33.266 --> 00:36:36.391
meters,
because that's how a radian is

00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:36.980
defined.
 

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.193
If that angle is
θ, that distance is

00:36:39.193 --> 00:36:41.730
just the distance to the screen
times θ.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.630
That will be 10^(-34) meters.
 

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.954
That means the wavelength of
the oscillation on your screen

00:36:47.954 --> 00:36:49.159
is 10^(-34) meters.
 

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.840
Can you see it?
 

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.019
Well, make the world's smallest
detector.

00:36:54.019 --> 00:36:56.800
It's as big as 1 proton, okay.
 

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.619
Nothing can be smaller.
 

00:36:57.619 --> 00:37:00.137
That's your whole detector,
all the parts,

00:37:00.137 --> 00:37:01.550
everything, 1 proton.
 

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:06.969
Size of a proton is 10^(-15)
meters.

00:37:06.969 --> 00:37:12.693
That means you will have
10^(19) oscillations inside your

00:37:12.693 --> 00:37:14.329
tiny detector.
 

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:15.719
So don't be fooled by the 19.
 

00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:17.780
Let's take a minute to savor
this.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.539
That's how many oscillations
you have, okay?

00:37:23.539 --> 00:37:25.690
You've got enough now?
 

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.260
3,6, 9,12, well,
I don't have enough time.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.039
That's a lot of oscillations.
 

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:35.030
You should check the numbers
though, okay?

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:39.621
I'm saying they typical angle
will be 10^(-34) radians and if

00:37:39.621 --> 00:37:43.972
you put the screen 1 meter away,
the spacing will be

00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:47.139
10^(-34)meters,
and you look at it with an

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:50.460
object, a detector,
whose size is 10^(-15) meters,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.539
which looks very small,
size of a proton.

00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:57.400
But look, 10^(19) fit into that
length, so your proton detector

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.420
looks huge.
 

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.320
In fact, I cannot even show it
here.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.500
So you don't see the
oscillations;

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.070
you see the average only.
 

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.423
If you see only the average,
you can show that with 2 slits

00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:11.969
open, the sum is the sum of the
two averages,

00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:14.110
so you don't see the
oscillation.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.920
That's the first reason.
 

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.670
Now you can say,
"You took a kilogram.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.090
Let me take a gram."
 

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.010
I said, "Go ahead.
 

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.105
Take a gram,
take a milligram and take a

00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:24.737
slit which is not 1 meter wide
but--1 meter apart,

00:38:24.737 --> 00:38:26.510
but 1 millimeter apart."
 

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.730
It doesn't matter.
 

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.284
You're playing around with
factors like 10 and 100 and

00:38:30.284 --> 00:38:30.670
1,000.
 

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.900
I got 10^(19) here.
 

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.619
So nothing you do will make any
dent on that.

00:38:36.619 --> 00:38:39.574
So in the macroscopic world,
you will not see this

00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:40.480
interference.
 

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.342
Another reason you won't see it
is that the particle should have

00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:47.039
a definite momentum.
 

00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:49.338
It's got an indefinite
momentum, it's coming in with

00:38:49.338 --> 00:38:51.365
different momenta,
then each will have its own

00:38:51.365 --> 00:38:53.710
interference pattern and they'll
get washed out.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:57.260
Finally, I told you,
if you ever try to see which

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.329
slit the particle took by
putting a light beam here,

00:39:01.329 --> 00:39:04.032
the minute you catch the
electron going through one slit

00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:07.659
or the other,
this pattern is gone.

00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:10.409
It will do this "I'm not
here and I'm not there"

00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:12.920
routine only if you never catch
it being anywhere.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.739
That's very interesting.
 

00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:17.657
The electron behaves like it
does not go through any one

00:39:17.657 --> 00:39:20.047
particular slit,
as long as you don't catch it

00:39:20.047 --> 00:39:21.480
going through one slit.
 

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.768
You put enough light to catch
every electron,

00:39:23.768 --> 00:39:26.836
then you can add the numbers
and you must get the sum of the

00:39:26.836 --> 00:39:27.670
two numbers.
 

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.474
Now for the atomic world,
it's possible for the electron

00:39:30.474 --> 00:39:33.280
to go for a long time without
encountering anything,

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.219
and the interference effects
come into play.

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:39.170
In a macroscopic world,
there is no way a macroscopic

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.574
object can travel for any length
of time without running into

00:39:42.574 --> 00:39:43.369
something.
 

00:39:43.369 --> 00:39:44.880
It will run into other air
molecules.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.909
It will run into cosmic ray
radiation.

00:39:46.909 --> 00:39:49.936
It can collide with black body
radiation from the big bang,

00:39:49.936 --> 00:39:50.510
anything.
 

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.717
The minute you have any contact
with it, this funny thing will

00:39:53.717 --> 00:39:54.349
disappear.
 

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:56.099
So that's one reason you don't
see it.

00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:58.268
Now we can go on and on and
give other numbers.

00:39:58.268 --> 00:40:01.414
I've given examples in my
notes, which I will post later

00:40:01.414 --> 00:40:01.699
on.
 

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.590
One of them is the uncertainty
principle.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.543
Why does it look like the
uncertainty principle is not

00:40:08.543 --> 00:40:09.440
important?
 

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.989
Take again, this is 10^(-34).
 

00:40:13.989 --> 00:40:16.110
Everything is in MKS units.
 

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:23.228
So take an object of mass 1
kilogram whose location is known

00:40:23.228 --> 00:40:26.849
to the accuracy of 1 proton.
 

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:27.289
Okay?
 

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:34.860
So this number is 10^(-15)
meters, do you understand?

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.623
You take an object made of
10^(23) protons and you know its

00:40:38.623 --> 00:40:40.960
location to the width of 1
proton.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.150
That's all you don't know about
its location.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.000
That's your Dx.
 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.199
What's the Dp?
 

00:40:45.199 --> 00:40:48.592
Well, Dp is now
10 to the, what,

00:40:48.592 --> 00:40:48.969
19?
 

00:40:48.969 --> 00:40:52.199
10^(-19).
 

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:56.010
Now Dp is
m times Dv.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.619
That's 10^(-19).
 

00:40:57.619 --> 00:41:01.659
If this is 1 kilogram,
Dv is

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:04.420
10^(-19)meters per second.
 

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.840
You don't know its velocity to
1 part in 10^(19).

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.789
Now how bad is that?
 

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:13.340
Well, suppose I start a
particle off exactly known

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.630
velocity, I know where it will
be forever.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.737
But suppose I don't know the
velocity to this accuracy,

00:41:19.737 --> 00:41:22.018
and I let it run for 1 year.
 

00:41:22.018 --> 00:41:24.449
So I don't know precisely where
it is, but how bad is it?

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:25.840
How badly do I not know?
 

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:34.391
Well, 1 year is 10^(7) seconds,
so if it runs for 1 year,

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:40.500
it will be unknown to 10^(-12
)meters.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:49.329
10^(-12)meters is what,
let's see?

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:55.670
It's 1/100 of an atom size,
1/100 the size of an atom.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.849
So you see, these uncertainties
are not important in real life.

00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:02.463
So everything that you think
has a definite position and

00:42:02.463 --> 00:42:04.650
momentum actually has a slight
uncertainty,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.052
but the uncertainties don't
lead to any measurable

00:42:08.052 --> 00:42:12.289
consequences over any distances
that you can actually have.

00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:14.690
So what I'm trying to tell you
is, there are these waves.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.351
They do all kinds of things,
they do interference and

00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:19.963
everything, but the condition
for them is really the

00:42:19.963 --> 00:42:21.090
microscopic world.
 

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.179
The minute the masses become
comparable to gram or kilogram

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.150
and distances and slits and so
on,

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.713
or like a meter or a
centimeter, these effects get

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:30.659
washed out.
 

00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:34.940
But in the atomic scale,
they are seen.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:41.481
Now the final thing I want to
mention before moving on to a

00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:47.909
completely new topic is the role
of probability in quantum

00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:49.489
mechanics.
 

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:53.230
We have seen that quantum
mechanics makes probabilistic

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.199
predictions.
 

00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:56.730
It says if you do the double
slit experiment,

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.121
I don't know where this guy
will land, but I'll give you the

00:43:00.121 --> 00:43:00.639
odds.
 

00:43:00.639 --> 00:43:04.449
Okay, now that looks like
something we have done many

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:06.719
times in classical mechanics.
 

00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:08.989
For example,
if you have a coin and you

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:11.320
throw the coin,
you flip it and you say,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.650
"Which way will it
land?"

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:17.199
well, it's a very difficult
calculation to do,

00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:19.070
but it can be done in
principle, because a coin,

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:23.429
once released from your hand,
can only land in one way.

00:43:23.429 --> 00:43:25.579
That's the determinism of
Newtonian mechanics.

00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:27.802
If you knew exactly how you
released it with what angle or

00:43:27.802 --> 00:43:29.967
momentum,
what's the viscosity of air,

00:43:29.967 --> 00:43:32.275
whatever you want,
if you give me all the numbers,

00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:33.480
I'll tell you it's head or
tails.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.219
There's no need to guess.
 

00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:38.090
In practice,
no one can do the calculation.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.481
What you do in practice is,
you throw the same coin 5,000

00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:43.260
times and you find out the odds
for head or tails and you say,

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.409
"I predict that when you
throw it next time,

00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:50.389
it will be .51 chance that it
will be heads."

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:52.599
That's how you give statistical
predictions.

00:43:52.599 --> 00:43:57.610
Now you did not have to use
statistics.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.601
You use it, because you cannot
really in practice do the hard

00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:01.300
calculation.
 

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.739
In principle, you can.
 

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:07.670
Secondly, if you toss a coin
and I hide it in my hand,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.050
I don't show it to you,
it's either head or tails,

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.268
and I say, "What do you
think it is?"

00:44:11.268 --> 00:44:13.639
you'll say, "It's .1
chance that it's heads."

00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:16.090
And I look at it,
it may be head or it may be

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:16.480
tail.
 

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.349
Suppose I got head.
 

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:22.400
It means that it was head even
before I opened my hand,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.000
right?
 

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.179
The correct answer's already
inside my hand.

00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:26.150
I just didn't know it.
 

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.059
I'm using odds,
but when I look at it,

00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:28.989
I get an answer.
 

00:44:28.989 --> 00:44:34.570
That's the answer it had even
before I looked.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.630
So I'll give another analogy
here.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:45.920
So this is a probability of
locating me somewhere.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.918
This is my home town,
Cheshire, this is Yale,

00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:55.010
and this is the infamous Route
10.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.396
So somebody has studied me for
a long time and said,

00:44:57.396 --> 00:45:00.110
"If you look for this guy,
here are the odds."

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:04.503
Either he's working at home or
he's working at Yale,

00:45:04.503 --> 00:45:07.519
and sometimes he's driving,
okay?

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:08.869
This is the probability.
 

00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:12.927
First thing to understand is
the spread out probability does

00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:15.679
not mean I am myself spread out,
okay?

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:19.780
Unless I got into a terrible
accident on Route 10,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.789
I'm in only one place.
 

00:45:21.789 --> 00:45:24.217
So probability's being extended
doesn't mean the thing you're

00:45:24.217 --> 00:45:25.230
looking at is extended.
 

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.840
I am in some sense a particle
which can be somewhere.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.539
These are the odds.
 

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:34.429
Well, suppose you catch me here
on one of your many trials.

00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:36.811
If you catch me only once,
you don't know if the

00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:38.989
prediction's even good,
so you repeat it.

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:41.367
You study me over many times
and you agree the person had got

00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:44.155
the right picture,
because after observing me

00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:48.668
many, many days you in fact get
the histogram that looks like

00:45:48.668 --> 00:45:49.268
this.
 

00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:52.635
The important thing is,
every time you catch me

00:45:52.635 --> 00:45:56.838
somewhere, I was already there;
you just happened to catch me

00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:57.269
there.
 

00:45:57.269 --> 00:46:00.179
I had a definite location.
 

00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:03.800
It was not known to you,
but I had it.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.496
I had a definite location
because in the macroscopic world

00:46:07.496 --> 00:46:10.416
I'm moving in,
my location is being constantly

00:46:10.416 --> 00:46:11.260
measured.
 

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.556
You didn't ask or you didn't
find out, but I'm running

00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:16.050
through air molecules.
 

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:16.900
I've slammed into them.
 

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.510
They know that.
 

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.518
I ran over this ant.
 

00:46:20.518 --> 00:46:22.780
That was the last thing the ant
knew, okay?

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.704
So I'm leaving behind a trail
of destruction and they all keep

00:46:26.704 --> 00:46:28.119
track of where I am.
 

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:29.730
My location is well known.
 

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.110
You just happened to find out.
 

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:37.170
But now let's change this
picture and say this is not me.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.719
This is an electron and it's
got two nuclei.

00:46:40.719 --> 00:46:43.630
This is nucleus 1 and this is
nucleus 2.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.768
It can be either near this
nucleus or that nucleus,

00:46:46.768 --> 00:46:49.404
and this is the
Y^(2) for the

00:46:49.404 --> 00:46:50.219
electron.
 

00:46:50.219 --> 00:46:53.617
That means it's the probability
you'll catch it here and you'll

00:46:53.617 --> 00:46:54.550
catch it there.
 

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:58.496
Once again, if you catch the
electron, you will catch all of

00:46:58.496 --> 00:46:59.699
it in one place.
 

00:46:59.699 --> 00:47:02.273
It is wrong to think the
electronic charge is somehow

00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:03.710
spread out around the atom.
 

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.579
It's not true.
 

00:47:04.579 --> 00:47:06.070
The charge is in one place.
 

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:07.360
The odds are spread out.
 

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.460
That looks just like my case.
 

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.623
But the difference is,
if you catch the

00:47:11.623 --> 00:47:15.094
electron--let's in fact simplify
life and say there are only 2

00:47:15.094 --> 00:47:16.119
possibilities.
 

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:19.550
Either it is near atom
1--nucleus 1 or nucleus 2,

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.409
only 2 discrete choices.
 

00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:26.597
If you catch it near 2,
it is wrong to think that it

00:47:26.597 --> 00:47:29.650
was there before you got it.
 

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.630
So where was it?
 

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.940
It was not in any one place.
 

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.719
It had no location till you
found its location.

00:47:39.719 --> 00:47:40.809
That's very strange.
 

00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:44.195
We think of measurement as
revealing a pre-existing

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:45.889
property of the object.
 

00:47:45.889 --> 00:47:48.659
But in quantum theory,
it's not that you don't know

00:47:48.659 --> 00:47:49.989
where the electron is.
 

00:47:49.989 --> 00:47:50.840
It does not know.
 

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.518
It is not anywhere.
 

00:47:52.518 --> 00:47:57.025
It's the act of measurement
that confers a location or

00:47:57.025 --> 00:47:59.320
position on the electron.
 

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.764
That state of being,
where you can be either here or

00:48:02.764 --> 00:48:06.748
there, or simultaneously here or
there, has no analog in the

00:48:06.748 --> 00:48:08.099
classical world.
 

00:48:08.099 --> 00:48:11.514
If anybody tries to give you an
example, don't believe it,

00:48:11.514 --> 00:48:14.990
because there are no examples
in the macroscopic world that

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.130
look like this.
 

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:21.197
No analogies should satisfy
you, because this has no analog

00:48:21.197 --> 00:48:23.469
in the real world,
okay?

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:26.179
So this is the interesting
thing in quantum mechanics.

00:48:26.179 --> 00:48:29.070
If this is a possible wave
function Y,

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.175
electron near nucleus 1,
and that's a possible wave

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:35.045
function Y,
electron near nucleus 2,

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:37.070
you can add the two functions.
 

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.829
That's another possible
function.

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:41.809
But what does that describe?
 

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:45.396
It describes an electron which
upon measurement could be found

00:48:45.396 --> 00:48:47.280
here and could be found there.
 

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.380
It's not like finding me in
Cheshire or finding me in New

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.070
Haven,
because in those cases,

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.139
on a given day on a given
measurement,

00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:56.469
you can only get one answer,
depending on where I am.

00:48:56.469 --> 00:48:58.739
Right now if they look for me,
they can only find me here.

00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:01.039
They cannot find me anywhere
else.

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:04.610
But in the case of the
electron, the one and the same

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.768
electron, on a given trial,
at a given instant,

00:49:07.768 --> 00:49:10.789
is fully capable of being here
or there.

00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:15.750
It's like tossing a coin and
it's in my hand.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.907
We all know that when I reveal
it to you, you can only get one

00:49:18.907 --> 00:49:22.170
answer, now that the toss has
been done, it's got one answer.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.257
If it's a quantum mechanical
coin, you don't know,

00:49:25.257 --> 00:49:28.030
and it doesn't have a value
till you look.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.000
When you look,
it has a definite value.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.099
Before you look,
it doesn't have a definite

00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:32.500
value.
 

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.514
That's exactly like saying,
when you looked,

00:49:34.514 --> 00:49:36.110
it goes through a definite
slit.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.800
When you don't look,
it's wrong to assume it went

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.800
through a definite slit.
 

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.880
Yes?
 

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.918
Student:  Say you had a
double slit experiment but

00:49:45.918 --> 00:49:48.900
instead of having a screen that
went all the way in both

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.070
directions,
you just sort of had _____

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:52.780
screen.
 

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:58.458
So then you would only be
looking at the final location of

00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:00.550
a _______ electron.
 

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.860
The other half you would know.
 

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.849
How would that work,
because location for some of

00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:10.969
them has to be ____________.
 

00:50:10.969 --> 00:50:13.034
Prof: The minute you
find the location to the

00:50:13.034 --> 00:50:15.059
accuracy of knowing which slit
it went through,

00:50:15.059 --> 00:50:17.599
you've got 2 slits or only 1 in
the experiment?

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:21.088
Student:  You have 2
slits but only a half screen,

00:50:21.088 --> 00:50:23.018
and nothing on the other one.
 

00:50:23.018 --> 00:50:25.427
Prof: Oh,
you've got a screen that only

00:50:25.427 --> 00:50:26.820
comes to here,
you mean?

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:27.440
Student:  Yes.
 

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.143
Prof: Yes,
the real problem of location

00:50:30.143 --> 00:50:33.869
that I'm talking about here is
not when it hits the screen,

00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:36.099
but here, when you try to see
which hole it went through,

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.559
by putting a light source here.
 

00:50:37.559 --> 00:50:40.293
I was referring to the fact
that if you have the right kind

00:50:40.293 --> 00:50:42.510
of light to know which hole it
went through,

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:46.110
if you give it enough momentum
to wash out the pattern.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:48.628
As far as the screen goes,
once it comes out,

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:51.664
it's the sum of these 2 waves
coming from the 2 holes,

00:50:51.664 --> 00:50:54.699
and it also doesn't have a well
defined position.

00:50:54.699 --> 00:50:58.039
The probability for finding it
may look like this.

00:50:58.039 --> 00:51:00.489
In fact, the probability will
look like this.

00:51:00.489 --> 00:51:01.210
Forget your screen.
 

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.679
This is the probability.
 

00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:04.952
The minute you catch it,
it is found there,

00:51:04.952 --> 00:51:07.389
that's the location after that
measurement.

00:51:07.389 --> 00:51:11.568
Prior to the measurement,
it can really be anywhere where

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.360
the function is not 0.
 

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.768
There are many wave functions.
 

00:51:14.768 --> 00:51:18.110
There's the 1 to the left of
the slit and there is 1--then it

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.949
becomes 2 wave functions coming
from the 2 slits.

00:51:20.949 --> 00:51:23.429
They form the interference
pattern and that gives you the

00:51:23.429 --> 00:51:25.690
odds that if you looked for it,
you will find it.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.539
Now till you find it,
it's not anywhere.

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:31.559
It can be anywhere on this line
at that instant.

00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:34.239
It's only the act of
measurement, or hitting a

00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:36.920
detector that tells you that's
my location.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.289
So you will have to get used to
that.

00:51:39.289 --> 00:51:42.875
You'll have to get used to the
fact that things don't have

00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:45.139
position, momentum,
angular momentum,

00:51:45.139 --> 00:51:47.969
energy or anything,
until you measure it.

00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:54.456
Okay, so I've got to tell you a
little more now about just

00:51:54.456 --> 00:51:55.710
position.
 

00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:00.489
So let's take--by the way,
any questions so far?

00:52:00.489 --> 00:52:01.920
Yes?
 

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.514
Student:  Can you
explain again how you can tell

00:52:04.514 --> 00:52:07.110
which hole the electron goes
through with the light?

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:08.840
Prof: Well,
you just see it.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.088
You see a flicker and if it's
near this hole,

00:52:11.088 --> 00:52:13.030
you know this guy went through
that.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.599
And if it's near that one,
you know it went through that.

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:17.775
But to have such good
resolution, the wavelength

00:52:17.775 --> 00:52:20.599
should be much smaller than the
space in between the slits.

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:23.788
Otherwise you'll get a big blur
and you won't know which one it

00:52:23.788 --> 00:52:24.559
went through.
 

00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:27.559
That's a soft measurement that
doesn't do you any good.

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:28.739
It won't destroy the pattern.
 

00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:31.000
That's because you don't know
which hole it went through.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.262
If you make it fine enough to
know which hole it went through,

00:52:34.262 --> 00:52:37.577
you will disrupt the electron's
momentum enough to wipe out the

00:52:37.577 --> 00:52:38.219
pattern.
 

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:39.369
Yes?
 

00:52:39.369 --> 00:52:48.639
Student: 
&gt;

00:52:48.639 --> 00:52:50.230
Prof: Oh, here?
 

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.280
You mean what happened to the 2?
 

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.409
Oh yeah, forget the 2s.
 

00:52:55.409 --> 00:52:58.389
There are 2p's I forgot, right?
 

00:52:58.389 --> 00:53:01.360
There's a lot of 2p's too
you've got to put in.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:05.780
10^(-34 )is not exactly the
answer, because I got 2p there.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.346
I'm just saying,
look, if it's 10^(-34),

00:53:08.346 --> 00:53:12.360
suppose you're talking about
how much money Bill Gates has.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.480
It's 10^(9).
 

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.630
Now is it 2 x 10^(9),
3 x 10^(9)?

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:19.927
I don't know,
but I'm not worried about his

00:53:19.927 --> 00:53:22.552
financial wellbeing,
because it's up there in the

00:53:22.552 --> 00:53:23.210
10^(9)s.
 

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.143
So whenever I do these
arguments, you should get used

00:53:26.143 --> 00:53:28.541
to this notion,
it's very common for physicist

00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:30.340
when they argue in quantum
mechanics,

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.300
will use the symbol that's not
quite an =.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.710
It looks like a wiggle and =.
 

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.389
Basically it means,
I'm not quite sure,

00:53:39.389 --> 00:53:42.000
but the number is in this
ballpark.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.677
And if this ballpark is 1,000
miles from that ballpark,

00:53:44.677 --> 00:53:46.909
you just have to know it's in
the ballpark.

00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:48.969
You don't have to know where it
is.

00:53:48.969 --> 00:53:50.480
Some things are definitely
macroscopic;

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.150
some things are definitely
microscopic.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:56.119
But something very interesting
is happening at Yale right now.

00:53:56.119 --> 00:54:00.166
People are asking the following
question: how small an object

00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:04.550
has to be before I can see its
quantum mechanical fluctuations?

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.653
We know that if it's like an
electron, it's completely

00:54:06.653 --> 00:54:07.210
fluctuating.
 

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.079
You don't know anything.
 

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.440
If it's like a bowling ball,
it seems to have a well defined

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:11.880
position.
 

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.289
Make the objects smaller and
smaller and smaller.

00:54:14.289 --> 00:54:19.530
How small can it be before it's
first beginning to show quantum

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:23.253
effects,
like quantization of energy or

00:54:23.253 --> 00:54:27.947
quantization of momentum,
depending on the problem,

00:54:27.947 --> 00:54:31.170
or quantum fluctuations in
position?

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:33.650
So those measurements are now
being carried out at Yale.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.766
It's a very exciting time and
it's so many years after the

00:54:36.766 --> 00:54:38.570
discovery of quantum mechanics.
 

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.501
Because we knew the really big
world and we knew the really

00:54:41.501 --> 00:54:43.389
small world,
but now we're trying to go,

00:54:43.389 --> 00:54:47.043
because of nanotechnology,
continuously from big to that

00:54:47.043 --> 00:54:49.349
small,
and how small is small?

00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:50.619
That's the question?
 

00:54:50.619 --> 00:54:55.690
Can a little macroscopic object
simultaneously be in two places?

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.849
Most of them seem to have a
well defined location.

00:54:57.849 --> 00:55:02.306
Can you create a situation when
it's capable of being found here

00:55:02.306 --> 00:55:03.579
and found there?
 

00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:05.626
It's very hard,
because you have to isolate the

00:55:05.626 --> 00:55:07.139
particle from the outside world.
 

00:55:07.139 --> 00:55:08.480
That's the first condition.
 

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.639
That's what ruins everything.
 

00:55:10.639 --> 00:55:12.809
A quantum computer,
you must know,

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:16.766
has got these bits called qbits
and unlike the bits in your

00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:19.324
laptop,
which are either 0 or 1,

00:55:19.324 --> 00:55:21.980
a qbit can also give you 0 or
1,

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:26.809
but it can also be in a state
where it can give either 0 or 1

00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:28.340
on a given trial.
 

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.032
The bits in your computer,
the particular bit right now is

00:55:32.032 --> 00:55:33.329
either a 0 or a 1.
 

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:35.617
Maybe you don't know it,
but it can only give you that

00:55:35.617 --> 00:55:37.130
answer because that's what it
is.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:39.945
Because that bit is in contact
with the world and the world is

00:55:39.945 --> 00:55:41.469
constantly measuring its value.
 

00:55:41.469 --> 00:55:45.085
A qbit is a quantum system
which can do one of two things,

00:55:45.085 --> 00:55:48.320
but it's isolated and it's
neither this nor that.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.170
It's like the electron going
through both slits.

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:55.909
So a quantum bit can explore
many possibilities.

00:55:55.909 --> 00:56:02.858
If you build a computer with 10
qbits it can be doing 2^(10)

00:56:02.858 --> 00:56:05.920
things at the same time.
 

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.460
And if it's got a million bits,
it's 2^(million) operations,

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.219
things it can be exploring at
the same time.

00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:15.954
That's why, as you know,
one of the ways to securely

00:56:15.954 --> 00:56:19.836
send your credit card
information is to use very large

00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:22.920
numbers,
on the assumption that no one

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.389
can factorize them.
 

00:56:24.389 --> 00:56:27.423
You can always multiply a 100
digit number by a 100 digit

00:56:27.423 --> 00:56:29.699
number on your computer
instantaneously.

00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:32.806
But if I gave you the 200 digit
number and told you to find the

00:56:32.806 --> 00:56:34.409
two factors you won't find it.
 

00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:37.760
You won't find it in the age of
the universe.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.860
It's amazing,
but that simple problem of

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:43.469
factorization cannot be done if
the numbers are 100 digits long,

00:56:43.469 --> 00:56:46.291
and that's the reason why
people openly broadcast the

00:56:46.291 --> 00:56:48.182
product,
they may broadcast one of the

00:56:48.182 --> 00:56:51.103
numbers,
and only the other person knows

00:56:51.103 --> 00:56:52.619
the second number.
 

00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:56.989
Now there is something somebody
called Shore,

00:56:56.989 --> 00:56:58.677
Peter Shore,
showed that if you have a

00:56:58.677 --> 00:57:01.302
quantum computer,
made up of these qbits,

00:57:01.302 --> 00:57:05.550
it can actually factor the
number exponentially faster,

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.719
namely, instead of taking
10^(10 )seconds,

00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:10.760
it will take 10 seconds.
 

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.650
So if you build a quantum
computer, you have two options.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:18.630
Either you can become famous,
or get tenure at Yale,

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:22.434
maybe, or you can go on the
biggest shopping spree of your

00:57:22.434 --> 00:57:25.177
life,
because you can get anybody's

00:57:25.177 --> 00:57:26.699
credit card number.
 

00:57:26.699 --> 00:57:27.789
So that's the choice.
 

00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:30.458
When you come to that fork,
you decide which way you want

00:57:30.458 --> 00:57:30.840
to go.
 

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.130
Maybe you can go through both
choices, I don't know.

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:35.889
That's something in your future.
 

00:57:35.889 --> 00:57:38.030
So why is it so hard to build a
quantum computer?

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:40.280
There are many,
many quantum systems which can

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.380
do one or two things,
and can be the state,

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.179
but they are both this and
that.

00:57:44.179 --> 00:57:47.579
The problem is,
they cannot be in contact with

00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:50.980
the outside world,
because single contact with

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.869
them is like a dream.
 

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.050
Think about it, it's gone.
 

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:54.550
Same thing.
 

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:56.309
Any measurement destroys it.
 

00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:59.795
Any unintended measurement also
destroys it, so you've got to

00:57:59.795 --> 00:58:01.768
keep your system fully isolated.
 

00:58:01.768 --> 00:58:04.693
A system that is not talking to
the outside world,

00:58:04.693 --> 00:58:07.320
unfortunately,
is also not talking to you.

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.849
So you cannot ask it any
questions, and if it knows the

00:58:09.849 --> 00:58:11.210
answer, it cannot tell you.
 

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:12.909
So sometimes you want it to
talk.

00:58:12.909 --> 00:58:13.860
It's like relationships.
 

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.889
Sometimes you don't want it to
talk.

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:17.070
So what do you do?
 

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.362
You've got to build a system
where sometimes,

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:21.967
in a controlled way,
you can make contact with your

00:58:21.967 --> 00:58:24.000
system, namely give it the
problem.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.556
Then it does its quantum thing,
then you've got to make a

00:58:26.556 --> 00:58:28.610
measurement to find out what the
answer is.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:31.550
Then you want to be able to get
into it again.

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:35.019
So the challenge for quantum
computers is how to keep them

00:58:35.019 --> 00:58:37.760
isolated long enough to do the
calculation.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.257
That's a challenge,
how to keep it from--how to

00:58:40.257 --> 00:58:43.079
keep it in what's called a
quantum coherent state.

00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:46.880
A coherent state is really when
it's doing many things at the

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:47.639
same time.
 

00:58:47.639 --> 00:58:52.163
All right, so I want to tell
you now more formally how to do

00:58:52.163 --> 00:58:54.079
more quantum mechanics.
 

00:58:54.079 --> 00:58:58.309
So let's take a simple example,
a particle living on a line.

00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:03.260
That's the function Y(x).
 

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:07.244
Let's ask the following
question: how do we do business

00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:09.090
in Newtonian mechanics?
 

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.309
We say, "Here's a particle.
 

00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:11.010
That's its x.
 

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.679
Here's the momentum.
 

00:59:11.679 --> 00:59:13.300
That's its p."
 

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.750
Given that, I know everything I
need to know right now.

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:19.193
Angular momentum,
r x

00:59:19.193 --> 00:59:21.619
p, Kinetic energy,
p^(2)/2m.

00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:25.210
Everything is given in terms of
the coordinates and momentum.

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:28.757
In quantum theory,
you don't even tell me where it

00:59:28.757 --> 00:59:29.119
is.
 

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:32.786
For every possible x,
there is a function whose

00:59:32.786 --> 00:59:36.728
square, if you now square this
guy, everything will be now

00:59:36.728 --> 00:59:38.320
positive, definite.
 

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.869
I don't know,
it's something like this.

00:59:39.869 --> 00:59:42.989
This is Y^(2).
 

00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:46.902
We say the height is
proportional to finding it

00:59:46.902 --> 00:59:48.010
everywhere.
 

00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:49.869
What is the condition on the
function side?

00:59:49.869 --> 00:59:52.670
The answer is,
whatever you like.

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:56.257
Anything I can draw,
with no special effort,

00:59:56.257 --> 00:59:59.679
is a possible function for an
electron.

00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:00.780
There are no restrictions.
 

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.358
It's like saying,
what should the position of the

01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:04.110
particle be?
 

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:05.000
x.
 

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.510
Any x you want is a
possible x.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:12.768
Likewise, any Y you draw is a
possible Y.

01:00:12.768 --> 01:00:15.976
That's a set of all possible
ampli--it's called wave

01:00:15.976 --> 01:00:19.057
functions--whose square is the
set of all possible

01:00:19.057 --> 01:00:20.190
probabilities.
 

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:24.302
So I said Y^(2),
Y at the point x^(2),

01:00:24.302 --> 01:00:29.139
is connected to the probability
of finding it at x.

01:00:29.139 --> 01:00:32.059
That has to be in fact to be
refined.

01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:33.639
That's not precisely the story.
 

01:00:33.639 --> 01:00:35.369
I'll tell you why.
 

01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:41.320
If a statistical event has got
6 possible answers,

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.994
like you throw the die,
you want to get any number from

01:00:43.994 --> 01:00:46.083
1 to 6,
you can give the probability

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:52.050
for 1,
probability for 2,3, 4,5 and 6.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:57.510
These are all the odds for
getting any number from 1 to 6.

01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:59.762
Since there are only a finite
number of things that can

01:00:59.762 --> 01:01:02.050
happen,
I call them I = 1 to 6,

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.900
there's a probability for each
I,

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.460
and if you add all the
probabilities,

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:13.429
you should get 1.
 

01:01:13.429 --> 01:01:17.231
But if the set of things that
can happen is a continuous

01:01:17.231 --> 01:01:19.786
variable like x,
in other words,

01:01:19.786 --> 01:01:22.969
the location of the electron is
not a discrete set of numbers.

01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:26.190
It's any real number is a
possible location.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.755
Then you cannot give a finite
probability for any one

01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:30.510
x.
 

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.601
If that was finite,
since the number of points is

01:01:33.601 --> 01:01:36.949
infinite, you cannot make the
total probability 1.

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:39.311
So what we really mean by
Y^(2) is called

01:01:39.311 --> 01:01:40.449
the probability density.
 

01:01:40.449 --> 01:01:42.677
That means draw the
Y^(2),

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:45.420
let this be the height of
Y^(2).

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.760
Take a little sliver of width
dx.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.157
The area under the graph,
P(x) dx,

01:01:53.157 --> 01:01:58.324
that is the probability of
finding the electron,

01:01:58.324 --> 01:02:03.380
or whatever particle,
between x and x

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.809
dx.
 

01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:05.250
You understand?
 

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:07.309
It's called a density.
 

01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:10.300
So you don't give a finite
probability to each point.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.913
For an infinitesimal region,
you give it infinitesimal

01:02:14.913 --> 01:02:19.440
probability, which is the
function P(x) dx.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.150
And the statement that the
particle has to be somewhere,

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:25.800
namely, all the probabilities
add up to 0,

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.969
is the statement that when you
integrate this probability

01:02:30.969 --> 01:02:38.380
density from - to infinity,
namely, Y^(2)dx,

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:50.099
from - to infinity,
that should be 1.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.820
This is called normalization.
 

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.119
It's a mathematical term.
 

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:58.375
Norm is connected to length in
some way, and these can be

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.909
viewed as length squared.
 

01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:07.039
Anyway, this is called the
normalization.

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:13.447
Now if somebody gave you a Y,
which did not obey this

01:03:13.447 --> 01:03:16.530
condition, here is a Y.
 

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:18.440
This already tells you a nice
story, right?

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.876
It tells you the odds are
pretty big here,

01:03:20.876 --> 01:03:22.599
pretty small there,
0 here.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:28.679
Now take a function that's
twice as tall.

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:31.639
That gives you the same
relative odds,

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:33.000
you understand.
 

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.831
So when you multiply Y by any
number, you don't change the

01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:37.768
basic predictive power of the
theory.

01:03:37.768 --> 01:03:41.065
It is just that if your
original Y had a square integral

01:03:41.065 --> 01:03:44.420
= 1, the new one may not have,
but the information is the

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:44.960
same.
 

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.710
It's really the relative height
of the function.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:52.570
That's another shocking thing
in quantum mechanics.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:59.326
If Y stood for a string
vibrating, 2 � Y (this is Y,

01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:06.847
this is 2 � Y) is a totally
different configuration of the

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:08.250
string.
 

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:13.070
But in quantum mechanics,
Y and any multiple of Y are

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:16.947
physically equivalent,
because what we extract from

01:04:16.947 --> 01:04:19.952
Y is the relative
probability of finding it here

01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:21.789
and there and there and there.
 

01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:27.106
So scaling the whole thing by a
factor, 2 or 4 or any number,

01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:28.880
it doesn't matter.
 

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.150
That's a very new thing.
 

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.920
That's why the Y is not
very physical.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920
If you took a string and you
pulled it by twice as much,

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.940
it's a totally different
situation.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.478
If you took the electric field
and made it twice as big,

01:04:40.478 --> 01:04:41.909
that's a different situation.
 

01:04:41.909 --> 01:04:43.909
Forces on electrons are doubled
now.

01:04:43.909 --> 01:04:45.679
In the quantum mechanical
Y,

01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:48.565
when you double it,
it stands for the same physical

01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:51.775
condition of the electron,
because the odds of being here

01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:53.619
versus being there are not
altered.

01:04:53.619 --> 01:04:57.719
The only job of Y is to
give you the odds.

01:04:57.719 --> 01:05:03.320
Therefore it's like saying in 2
dimensions, that's a vector,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.980
that's a different vector.
 

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.750
But suppose you only care about
the direction of the vector.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.981
For some reason,
you don't care how long it is,

01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:14.036
you just want to know which way
it points, then of course all of

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.539
these are considered equal.
 

01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:17.320
And that's really how it is for
quantum mechanics.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.619
Every Y and every
multiple of it stands for one

01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:23.000
situation only.
 

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.161
So what one normally does is
from all these vectors in that

01:05:26.161 --> 01:05:28.108
direction,
you may pick one whose length

01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:30.490
is 1 and say,
"Let me use that member of

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.018
the family to stand for the
situation."

01:05:33.018 --> 01:05:37.333
That's like saying of all the
Y's obtained by scaling

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:41.429
up and down, I'll pick one whose
square integral is 1.

01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:44.297
So let me do a concrete
example, so you know what I'm

01:05:44.297 --> 01:05:45.179
talking about.
 

01:05:45.179 --> 01:05:50.489
So let's take a function that
looks like this.

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:57.498
It is 0 everywhere,
and it has a height A between a

01:05:57.498 --> 01:05:58.760
and -a.
 

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.739
That's my Y.
 

01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:06.887
So Y(x) = A for
absolute value(x) less

01:06:06.887 --> 01:06:09.969
than a and = 0 outside.
 

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:17.710
That's a possible wave function
Y.

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:20.110
Now what does it tell you in
words?

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.559
If it's a word problem,
what does it tell you about the

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:23.059
electron?
 

01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:25.719
Can anybody tell me?
 

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:28.820
What can you say about the
electron given by this function?

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.530
What do you know about it?
 

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:32.369
Yes?
 

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:35.130
Student:  It must be
found within or -a.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:38.409
Prof: It must be found
within or -a and more than that.

01:06:38.409 --> 01:06:40.699
Student: 
&gt;

01:06:40.699 --> 01:06:41.210
Prof: That is correct.
 

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.380
Student:  With the same
probability.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.800
Prof: With the same
probability, okay?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.869
The probability is it
restricted to -a to a,

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:50.010
and it's the same throughout
the interval.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.588
After all, if you just set it
restricted to -a to a,

01:06:52.588 --> 01:06:55.371
it's true for this function
too, but that's not the same

01:06:55.371 --> 01:06:56.130
everywhere.
 

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.039
I've got a guy who's same
everywhere.

01:06:58.039 --> 01:07:03.867
Do you agree that this function
has exactly the same property,

01:07:03.867 --> 01:07:09.219
restricted to -a to a,
and the probability's constant?

01:07:09.219 --> 01:07:11.320
So there are many,
many functions you can draw,

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.282
all with the same statement
that this object has got equal

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:18.760
likelihood to be in this
interval and 0 outside.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.548
Of this family,
we are going to pick one guy

01:07:21.548 --> 01:07:23.429
whose square integral is 1.
 

01:07:23.429 --> 01:07:25.920
So I'm going to keep this
number A,

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.429
the height of the function,
as a free parameter,

01:07:28.429 --> 01:07:32.559
and I'm going to choose is so
that A^(2)--

01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:36.503
so that the
Y^(2)dx

01:07:36.503 --> 01:07:42.039
from - to infinity,
I want it to be 1.

01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:44.059
And I'll pick A so that
that is true.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:46.590
Well, we can do this integral
in our head.

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:47.969
What is this integral?
 

01:07:47.969 --> 01:07:52.574
This is just the square of
A times the width of this

01:07:52.574 --> 01:07:53.289
region.
 

01:07:53.289 --> 01:07:56.210
That's got to be 1.
 

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.755
That tells me that A
must be chosen to be

01:07:59.755 --> 01:08:03.302
1/(2a)^(1/2),
where this little a,

01:08:03.302 --> 01:08:06.849
2a, is now the width of
this region.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:11.952
Therefore from this whole
family, the normalized Y

01:08:11.952 --> 01:08:15.688
will look like
1/(2a)^(1/2 )for mod

01:08:15.688 --> 01:08:19.880
x &lt;
or = a and 0 outside.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.137
And we can all see at a glance
that if you squared this

01:08:23.137 --> 01:08:26.456
normalized Y and
integrated from -a to a you will

01:08:26.456 --> 01:08:27.060
get 1.
 

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.270
This is normalization.
 

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:32.731
So sometimes,
people will give you a wave

01:08:32.731 --> 01:08:36.612
function and they will say as a
first step, "Normalize this

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.090
wave function."
 

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.921
What you have to do is,
you've got to square the wave

01:08:40.921 --> 01:08:43.590
function and then put a number
in front of it,

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:47.542
and choose it so that the
number makes the square integral

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:47.819
1.
 

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:50.538
Let me give you another example.
 

01:08:50.538 --> 01:08:54.020
There's a very famous function,
called the Gaussian function.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.408
It looks like this.
 

01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:03.282
The function e^(-α(x
(squared)))dx from - to

01:09:03.282 --> 01:09:07.083
infinity happens to have an area
which is square root of

01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:09.090
p/a.
 

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:13.149
That is just one of those
tabulated integrals.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:18.529
So here's a bell shaped
function with this property.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:24.640
Now I want to make a quantum
mechanical wave function that

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.823
looks like the
Y(x) = A

01:09:28.823 --> 01:09:33.220
e^(- x) squared over 2 D
squared.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.529
That's a possible wave
function, right?

01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:38.041
Nothing funny about it,
but what do you know about the

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:38.800
wave function?
 

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.880
It's biggest at x = 0.
 

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.960
It's symmetric between and
-x.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.960
And it dies off very quickly,
but how far should you go?

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.189
You can easily guess that when
x is much bigger than D,

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.765
this function is gone,
because

01:09:53.765 --> 01:09:56.810
x/D^(2) is
going on the exponent.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.403
So if that number's big,
it's e to the - big,

01:09:59.403 --> 01:10:00.698
which is very small.
 

01:10:00.698 --> 01:10:04.305
So roughly speaking the width
of this graph is of order

01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:05.908
D or 2D.
 

01:10:05.908 --> 01:10:09.012
I'm just going to call it
D, just to give you an

01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:10.220
order of magnitude.
 

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.684
So that's an electron whose
location is roughly known to an

01:10:14.684 --> 01:10:16.069
amount D.
 

01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:18.845
But this is not normalized,
because if I take the square of

01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:19.899
this, I won't get 1.
 

01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:23.149
So I will choose A so
that 1 =

01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:26.038
Y^(2)xdx.
 

01:10:26.038 --> 01:10:28.952
This being real,
I don't need the absolute value

01:10:28.952 --> 01:10:29.819
of Y.
 

01:10:29.819 --> 01:10:35.539
That gives me A^(2)e
^(-x(squared))/

01:10:35.539 --> 01:10:38.810
D^(2)dx.
 

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.807
The 2 went away,
because I squared the function

01:10:41.807 --> 01:10:43.960
Y, so don't forget that.
 

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.710
Now I look at the table of
integrals and what is a?

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:53.069
When I compare these 2,
a is just 1/D^(2).

01:10:53.069 --> 01:11:02.948
So it's square root of
pD^(2).

01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:05.356
This is an easy thing,
because I'm already giving you

01:11:05.356 --> 01:11:07.994
the integral you need to do,
but I want you to get used to

01:11:07.994 --> 01:11:08.319
it.
 

01:11:08.319 --> 01:11:10.738
So this whole thing should be 1.
 

01:11:10.738 --> 01:11:15.506
That means A is
1/pD^(2) to the fourth

01:11:15.506 --> 01:11:18.029
root, the power ¼.
 

01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:21.140
Therefore the normalized wave
function,

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:27.344
Y normalized,
looks like 1/pD^(2) to

01:11:27.344 --> 01:11:33.296
the ¼,
e^( −x(squared

01:11:33.296 --> 01:11:36.828
))/2D^(2).
 

01:11:36.828 --> 01:11:38.350
Normalization is just a
discipline.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:41.934
You discipline yourself to take
all functions and normalize

01:11:41.934 --> 01:11:44.529
them, because why do you
normalize them?

01:11:44.529 --> 01:11:48.953
If you normalize them to 1,
then Y^(2) is

01:11:48.953 --> 01:11:52.560
directly the absolute
probability density.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.510
That means when you add it all
up, you'll get 1.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.274
If you don't normalize it to 1,
Y^(2) is the

01:11:58.274 --> 01:11:59.779
relative probability density.
 

01:11:59.779 --> 01:12:01.979
It will still tell you the
relative odds of this and that,

01:12:01.979 --> 01:12:05.100
but you cannot say this
interval from here to here,

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.279
the chances are 30 percent for
catching it.

01:12:07.279 --> 01:12:09.881
You must take the region that
you're integrating,

01:12:09.881 --> 01:12:11.399
divide by the whole thing.
 

01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:15.625
But you don't have to divide by
the whole thing if you've

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.210
normalized it to 1.
 

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:20.250
Okay, this is just practice in
normalization.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:24.545
So I'm going to give you a
little hint on what is going to

01:12:24.545 --> 01:12:29.065
happen next, but I won't do it
now, so you guys don't have to

01:12:29.065 --> 01:12:30.800
take down anything.
 

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.042
Just ask the following question
and we'll come back to it on

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.109
Wednesday.
 

01:12:37.109 --> 01:12:42.386
I've told you that in Newtonian
mechanics, every particle has an

01:12:42.386 --> 01:12:45.149
x and it has a p.
 

01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:47.604
In quantum theory,
instead we traded for a

01:12:47.604 --> 01:12:51.198
function Y(x) and
we learned the meaning of the

01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:53.774
Y(x) is that
absolute value of

01:12:53.774 --> 01:12:57.010
Y^(2) is the
probability density,

01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:00.328
meaning P(x) dx is the
probability of finding it

01:13:00.328 --> 01:13:02.479
between x and x
dx.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.940
Now we can say,
"Okay, that's enough about

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.529
position.
 

01:13:05.529 --> 01:13:08.770
What about momentum?"
 

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:10.520
I can measure the momentum of a
particle.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.488
You talked about momentum on
and off in the lecture.

01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:18.170
If I measure momentum,
what answer will I get?"

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:24.680
What are the odds for getting
this or that answer?

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.161
So given Y(x)
that looks like this,

01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:31.569
you square it,
you get Y(P(x)).

01:13:31.569 --> 01:13:33.416
The question is,
x is not the only thing

01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:34.300
we're interested in.
 

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.546
Even in Newtonian mechanics,
x and p were

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.750
equally important.
 

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:41.109
What do you think will happen
now?

01:13:41.109 --> 01:13:46.157
How do I find out what happens
if, instead of being interested

01:13:46.157 --> 01:13:50.211
in where I find it,
I ask, with what momentum will

01:13:50.211 --> 01:13:51.368
I find it?
 

01:13:51.368 --> 01:13:55.853
Can you imagine a guess on what
the answer might be or in what

01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:58.720
form the answer will be given to
you?

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.880
This is a wild guess.
 

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.094
Nobody expects you to invent
quantum mechanics in 30 seconds,

01:14:04.094 --> 01:14:05.710
so make a wild guess.
 

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:06.520
Yes?
 

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.939
Anybody there want to make a
wild guess?

01:14:09.939 --> 01:14:11.590
No?
 

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.829
Go ahead, yes, you're smiling.
 

01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:15.979
Make a guess.
 

01:14:15.979 --> 01:14:20.229
I want the odds for different
values for momentum.

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:22.744
How do you think that
information will be contained in

01:14:22.744 --> 01:14:23.408
this theory?
 

01:14:23.408 --> 01:14:31.420
Student: 
&gt;

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:31.760
Prof: Pardon me?
 

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.828
Student: 
&gt;

01:14:32.828 --> 01:14:35.171
Prof: Maybe,
based on the uncertainty

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:38.604
principle, but I want for every
value of momentum a probability,

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:39.149
right?
 

01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:40.750
I want the odds of getting this
p or that p or

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.939
that.
 

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:46.960
So what do you think we need to
get the odds for every momentum?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.609
Yes?
 

01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:50.550
Student: 
&gt;

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:51.859
Prof: Pardon me?
 

01:14:51.859 --> 01:14:54.877
Student:  If you have a
more defined location _________

01:14:54.877 --> 01:14:57.945
calculate the probabilities of
momentum, same way we did it for

01:14:57.945 --> 01:14:58.590
location?
 

01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.960
Prof: Right.
 

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.640
So what you will need,
it seems reasonable to think,

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.199
that this guy contained all the
information on where you will

01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:08.310
find it,
maybe there's a different

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:14.496
function of momentum,
whose square will give you the

01:15:14.496 --> 01:15:18.880
probability density that you
get--

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.340
if that function looks like
this and you square that,

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:24.912
that's the odds for getting one
momentum versus another

01:15:24.912 --> 01:15:25.640
momentum.
 

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.385
After all, every variable in
classical mechanics you can

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:31.279
measure in the quantum theory
and you can give the odds.

01:15:31.279 --> 01:15:33.783
And for every variable,
it looks like you need a

01:15:33.783 --> 01:15:34.368
function.
 

01:15:34.368 --> 01:15:37.439
What I will show you is that
you don't need that.

01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:40.342
Y(x) itself
contains information on what

01:15:40.342 --> 01:15:42.368
happens when you measure
momentum,

01:15:42.368 --> 01:15:43.868
what happens when you measure
energy,

01:15:43.868 --> 01:15:45.988
what happens when you measure
anything--

01:15:45.988 --> 01:15:48.300
and how do you extract it is
what we'll talk about.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:53.000

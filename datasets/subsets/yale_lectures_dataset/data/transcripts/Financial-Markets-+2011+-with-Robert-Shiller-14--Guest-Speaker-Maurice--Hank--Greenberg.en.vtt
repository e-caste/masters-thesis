00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.020
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: I'm
very pleased that we have Hank

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.080
Greenberg here today.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.375
We've already talked about
him and his career.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:09.540
Let me just reiterate it.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.002
It's a most amazing career.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:17.742
It starts when you landed
on D-Day, right?

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:20.630
On Omaha Beach, amazing.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.430
At age 17?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.930
18?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.140
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
A little over 18 then.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
And this goes way back.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.388
And then, participated in the
liberation of Dachau at the

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.030
end of World War II.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.960
And then, not to be stopped,
was involved in the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.060
Korean War as well.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.970
And then, took over an insurance
company, and made it

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.982
into the most important
insurance

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:51.440
company in the world.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.185
And experienced a number of
vicissitudes inherited with

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:56.900
that as well.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.503
So, I was asking Mr. Greenberg,
if he would talk

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:09.177
about what he did, how he made
this enormous success.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.438
We're interested in finance
here, so do something about

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:20.946
how it was financed, but as
we've been emphasizing in this

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:26.070
course, it's more than just
mathematical CAPM modeling,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.510
it's about incentivizing people,
about finding people

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.700
with the right character.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.650
And I think that you can tell us
about your experiences, and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.870
what you've learned over
so many years.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.140
So, I'll turn it over to you.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.016
And then, we'll stop at around
10, and then, we have time for

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:52.229
a few questions from you.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.479
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
That's fine.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.820
Good morning.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.950
Let me start, really, picking
up where the professor --

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.505
I enlisted in the Army
when I was 17.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:10.800
I hadn't finished high school.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770
World War II was on.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.800
I felt I wanted to do something,
and I was bored.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.090
So, I was able to fix a
birth certificate, so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.020
it said I was 18.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.650
And they had no problem taking
me, because they weren't

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.900
looking too closely.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.940
I went to Europe, went to
England first. I got there in

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.890
1943, a year before
the invasion.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
Spent the year training.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.520
Left England, went
to the continent,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.390
obviously, on D-Day.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.380
Then, went all the way through
Europe, linked up with the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.525
Russians in Linz, Austria.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.040
The war was then over.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.630
Came back.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.200
I had to finish high school,
which was a chore.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.120
Coming back after being in a
war, and going back to high

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.990
school was one of the toughest
times in my life, actually.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.690
But I did, went on to college,
and law school.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.760
Finished law school when the
Korean War broke out.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320
I was a Reserve officer.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.970
I'd gotten commissioned toward
the end of the war.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.720
Spent the year in Korea,
separated as a captain.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.590
Came close to staying in the
military, because I was fairly

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.520
young and moved up pretty well
in rank, and was offered --

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.680
tried to incentivize
me to stay in the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.600
military, but I didn't.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.670
But I had finished law school,
and came back.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.360
I was married by then.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.190
I just married a girl that
I met in college.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.110
And had to get a job.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.339
I didn't feel like
practicing law.

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.029
I didn't think --

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.560
I had a law degree --

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.480
I didn't think I wanted
to do that.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.300
I came back from Korea, and
the next day went down to

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.690
visit some of my friends who I
went to law school with, and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.200
it convinced me that I didn't
want to practice law.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.380
And as I left their office, I
went by an insurance company,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.880
Continental Casualty Company.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.240
And I thought, I'd see if
they had a job opening.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.970
And I went in, went up to the
personnel director, and he was

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.690
kind of nasty.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.920
I had just come back from Korea,
and I came back, I had

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.830
orders to fly back, so
I was really very

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.090
untamed at that moment.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.600
You know, just only about four
days before that, I still had

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.360
mud on my boots.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.180
And so, I went down to the main
floor, looked around the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.905
directory, and there was a
resident vice president

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:09.805
by the name of [?

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:12.710
Bob Braureid ?].

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.540
I just walked into his office
and said, you have a --

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.300
the word I used is not
the word I use now --

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.130
you don't have a very good
personnel director.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.880
And I was a little more excited
than that, and I wound

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.540
up getting a job.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.670
And I started as a junior
underwriter in

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.210
the insurance business.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.700
So, what is a junior
underwriter?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.230
You analyze risks and decide
whether the company wants to

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.890
write those risks or not.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.120
And I had to get a job, because
I said I was married

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.340
and had responsibilities.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.290
And I kind of liked it.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.530
I was working in what they
call the Special Risk

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.830
Division, which was
different kinds of

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.910
risks almost everyday.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.970
Some were sports risks.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.160
Some was accidental deathing
for executives.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.400
It was a whole range
of different

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.830
risks you had to analyze.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.080
I found it interesting.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.510
I became the youngest vice
president in the history of

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.640
that company, and moved
to Chicago where

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.640
its head office was.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.610
And about a couple
of years later --

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.680
it's a long story so I won't
take you through --

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.840
I met Starr, C.V. Starr, who was
the founder of the company

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.940
that I chair today.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:49.040
Starr started his company
in China in 1919.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.400
Long time.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.570
And obviously during World War
II, he had to leave, and came

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.590
back to the United States.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.020
And he had a series of small
insurance companies then.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.360
I was intrigued with his
business, because it operated

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.890
outside the United States
by and large.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.340
He had one company in the
United States called The

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.230
American Home, which really
was a failure.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.210
It was not doing well, and he
was embarrassed by that fact.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.830
That a company that was not
doing well that he owned.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.000
His other business: He
represented American companies

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.180
in doing business overseas.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.960
It was called the AIU, American
International

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.220
Underwriters.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.370
It was one of a kind.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.760
And it operated mostly in Asia,
one or two European

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:53.690
countries, but, by and large,
its background was really

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.140
Asian, having started in China,
as I said, in 1919.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:05.550
So anyway, I joined Starr and
took over The American Home in

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.760
New York, which I said
was not doing well.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.320
It was a failure.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.230
Now, what was wrong with it?

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.309
It did business through agents,
and depending upon the

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:23.700
skill of a company, it would
determine the quality of the

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.830
agents that it had.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.690
And while it was an old company,
it had a very poor

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.370
agency organization.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:39.530
And so, the quality of its
business was very, very poor.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.490
So, it was losing money
year in and year out.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.710
And the job I had was
to turn it around.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.790
To cut to that short, I got
rid of all the agents, and

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.700
went toward the corporate
brokerage business.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.680
Instead of writing small
businesses, we began writing

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.860
large commercial risks.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.640
And we needed a lot
of reinsurance.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:13.700
I went to London, got Lloyd's
to back that strategy.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.760
And up to then, most of the
large risks were being written

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.560
in London at Lloyd's.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.180
Very few American companies had
the skills to underwrite

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.670
large, complicated risks,
whether it was large property

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:34.730
risk, or casualty, or marine,
aviation, very difficult risk.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:41.620
And we assembled a group of
quality underwriters, and we

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.530
started doing that.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.750
We ultimately became the largest
brokerage underwriting

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.230
company in the United States.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.340
We were going to run out of
capital, we were growing so

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.340
rapidly and successfully.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.220
So, I looked around for a couple
of other companies that

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.350
had the same problems
that we had, before

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.590
we turned it around.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.960
I found one called the
National Union.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.480
We bought that, got rid of all
of its agents and agency

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.610
business, and consolidated
that into American Home.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.570
It kept its identity, because
it was a very old company.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.300
It was one of the
oldest companies

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.860
in the United States.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.080
And then, subsequently, bought
the New Hampshire Insurance

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.110
Company, did the same thing.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.020
By now it's 19 --

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.120
in the mid '60s.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:44.840
And by 1967, I created AIG, put
a holding company on top

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.135
of these three companies,
and AIG was born.

00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:56.510
In '67, I also became the head
of C.V. Starr &amp; Co., which was

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:02.020
the owner, by and large, of
these insurance companies.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:08.270
Starr died in 1968, but he
saw the beginning of AIG.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.340
It was formed.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.980
We also owned a life insurance
company, called American Life,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.330
that did business outside
the United States.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.990
And we consolidated that into
AIG, so we had both a life and

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.330
a non-life business.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.900
And we were expanding
internationally.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.880
We ultimately did business
in 130 countries.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.900
We opened markets around
the world.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.940
We introduced new types
of insurance.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.120
One of the things that made
us different was, that we

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.720
continued to evolve new products
that the business or

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.780
individuals needed.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.070
For example, we were the first
ones to introduce directors

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.515
and officers liability
insurance

00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:54.410
in the United States.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.420
We introduced political
risk insurance.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.280
American companies doing
business in very difficult

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.510
environments, where their
business might be nationalized

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.870
or confiscated, we insured
against those risks.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.180
We introduced kidnap
ransom insurance.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.640
American companies doing
business in the

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.860
not-so-friendly countries, where
some of the employees

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.270
might be kidnapped and
held for ransom.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.950
We insured against that.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.870
And we put together a unit that
helped find them and get

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.920
their release.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.080
Sometimes on a friendly
basis, sometimes

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.010
not so friendly basis.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.780
So, we were very creative in
developing products that

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.150
American business needed
around the world.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.870
We began to diversify, because
the insurance business, the

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.460
property casualty business, is
a very volatile business.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.600
You're subject to earthquakes.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.462
You're subject to hurricanes.

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:59.050
You're subject to different
economic environments.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.850
And that affects the outcome
of your business.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.670
And so, we wanted to diversify
not just within the property

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.020
casualty business,
but globally.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.040
That's why we entered so many
countries around the world,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.270
which gave us diversification.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.710
More diversification in your
business provides greater

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.590
stability, and that became one
of the things that was very

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.940
important to us.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.730
We also focused on, what the
expense ratio should be.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.760
Most insurance companies
are running an expense

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.090
ratio of about 30%.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:43.120
We ran our company with an
expense ratio of 19%.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.220
And how'd we do that?

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.740
Being the most efficient, using

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.850
reinsurance very, very properly.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:57.230
So, we did a much better job
in both developing our

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.320
business and managing the
business in a more efficient

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.190
way than others would do.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.790
And obviously, you have to
have an organization.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.810
You have to surround yourself
with people, who share the

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.360
same values, the same
aspirations that you do.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.720
You have to have a team
that works hand in

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.640
glove, and we did.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.520
The senior management of AIG was
like a band of brothers.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.440
We saw things alike.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.620
We worked well together.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.090
I mean, there wasn't ever
a palace revolution or

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.950
anything like that.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.410
It was a great organization.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.080
We added more diversification,
because clearly

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.810
diversification was essential.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.010
But in order to do business in
many countries, you had to

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.240
open the market.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.430
Markets didn't welcome you
in many countries.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.680
Take Japan, for example, it
was a very closed market.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.510
The Japanese were very reluctant
to open their market

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:06.750
to foreign insurers, so we had
to force the market open.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.380
And we did.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.100
The U.S. government was very
much on our side, and if the

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.110
Japanese didn't open their
market to us, we worked hard

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.960
to keep some of their own
companies, whether it was

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.340
insurance or otherwise, or
other things, from doing

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.220
business in the United States.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.630
We didn't hesitate to use the
U.S. government to support our

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.870
desire to open markets
around the world.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:42.180
When there was negotiation on
trade, for example -- most of

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:47.860
the negotiation in the early
years was on goods and trade.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.580
Things, not financial
services.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.300
Financial services were not
negotiated at the world trade

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.420
negotiations, the WTO.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.090
We brought that into being.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.650
I served on the President's
advisory board for trade

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.160
negotiations.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.130
They had never heard of

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.940
negotiating financial services.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.910
And it took us a while to get
that done, but we did.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.230
We opened the market for
financial services to be

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.490
negotiated.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.470
And there were rules then that
came into existence, so that

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.120
you can negotiate
trade services.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.110
It wasn't easy, even when the
rules were changed, countries

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.976
dragged their feet.

00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:41.130
It took a long time to open
us in Japan and Korea.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:46.020
China, it took me from 1975,
the first time I visited

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:51.650
China, to 1992, to get the first
life insurance license

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.260
ever granted to a
foreign company.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:17:00.210
Moreover, while other foreign
companies afterwards could

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.200
only get a license where
they could only own

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.440
49%, we owned 100%.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.810
And to date, still, it's the
only foreign company in China,

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:15.405
a life insurance company, that
owns 100% of the company.

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:16.660
It wasn't easy.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.160
As I say, it took
from '75 to '92.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.420
And I visited China every year,
a couple of times a

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.720
year, to make that happen.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.650
But we did a lot of
things for China.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.370
At the same time,
we helped China.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:35.830
I lobbied very hard for China's
entry into WTO, which

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.730
was very important for our
country and for China, and

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.450
really for the world.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.760
So, we were very active, and
you had to be in foreign

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.830
policy matters.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.090
It was linked to our business.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.510
Since we did business, I said,
in ultimately 130 countries,

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.920
it became essential that we were
at the leading edge of

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.870
what the foreign policy
issues were.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.180
We did business behind the Iron
Curtain, before the Iron

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:10.040
Curtain came down, in Hungary,
Poland and Romania.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.800
Moreover, I went to the Soviet
Union in 1964, during the

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.060
height of the Cold War, and
began a reinsurance

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.960
relationship with them.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.455
And that lasted throughout the
years, even during the height

00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:31.380
of the Cold War we had a
relationship going on.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.240
It wasn't easy.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.090
They thought I was in the
CIA, most of the time.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.640
It was a difficult thing,
but we persisted.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:48.760
And when the Iron Curtain came
down, we had a head start

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.536
against anybody else.

00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:56.120
Doing business in Romania, and
Hungry, and Poland, before the

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.030
Curtain came down, was not
easy, but we built

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:04.560
relationships, so that, when it
did happen, we had a head

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.950
start against anybody else.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.190
We operated all through Latin
America, the Middle East,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.080
parts of Africa.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.770
And all those were a story in
themselves, because in each

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.910
country it was a different
environment, and you had to

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.785
deal with different
personalities and governments.

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:29.160
It was very difficult.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.240
But we also had some
basic principles.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.310
We would never, never be
involved in a bribe.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.790
Anybody in our company that got
involved in anything like

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.830
that would be fired instantly.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.390
We understood what the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act meant,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.070
before they even had such a
Corrupt Foreign Practices Act.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.060
So, we had a reputation
that you didn't tamper

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.900
with us that way.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.820
And they knew also that we
wouldn't hesitate to retaliate

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.230
through our government if
necessary, if they tried to

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.100
keep us out of their country.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.130
So, we were tough
on that basis.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.360
We wanted to open markets,
and we did.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.790
You go back, what kind of
a structure did we have?

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.600
And how do you bring a group
of people together that can

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.680
work so harmoniously and
enthusiastically together.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.970
It's critical.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.670
And to run a business like
that, you have to have an

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:32.480
organization that, really,
everybody's on the same track,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.510
and everybody is enthusiastic
about what they're doing.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:42.110
Our overseas people, we had what
we called an MOP, Mobile

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.705
Overseas Personnel.

00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:46.350
It was like our own
state department.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.350
You can be working in Nigeria
today as a manager, and then

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.260
six months later you might
be in Singapore,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.850
or some other country.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.480
And so, you have to be mobile,
and you have to be prepared to

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.570
move, and not be reluctant
because of

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.700
one thing or another.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:11.390
And becoming an MOP was
a very high honor.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.316
Everybody couldn't get
that designation.

00:21:13.316 --> 00:21:15.460
You had to earn it.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.740
And it was a great
group of people.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.790
But how do you motivate
people to do that?

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:28.280
How do you get an organization
that could be so effective?

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:38.910
AIG at its pinnacle, when I left
in 2005, was the, by far,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.140
largest and most profitable
insurance company in history.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.660
I mean, think about that.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.910
From a dead stop.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.640
Now, we had a compensation
structure that was unique to

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.140
the industry.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.630
I mentioned it briefly
to the professor.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:03.790
C.V. Starr &amp; Co., we considered
to be the ultimate

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.030
company in the group.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:12.390
It spawned AIG, and so, within
the organization, it was

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.570
viewed as the top company
in the group.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:24.170
And since we spawned AIG, and
put assets into AIG in

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:31.870
exchange for AIG stock, so
that C.V. Starr and Starr

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.540
International, the two
companies, owned in the

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.460
beginning, 100% of AIG.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.560
As we grew, and we needed more
capital, because we were

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.510
growing so rapidly, we had to
raise capital, and therefore

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.470
we got somewhat diluted.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:54.960
But even at the end, we
controlled about 15% of AIG.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.710
The market cap was close to $200
billion dollars from a

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.730
dead stop of $300 million, when
we first went public.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.970
From $300 million to $200
billion, one of the largest

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.240
companies in the world.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.820
So, we weren't afraid of
anybody taking us over.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.840
Nobody was big enough to
even attempt that.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.270
But what we did, we had
several principles.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.020
Nobody could earn more than
$1 million in salary.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.370
I put that rule in.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.960
Two, nobody would
have a contract.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.290
You stayed in AIG because you
loved it, and you didn't have

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.110
to have a contract.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.410
And I refused a contract
any number of times.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:45.950
But you got bonuses based on
performance, and performance

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.030
was fairly rigid.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.070
We tried to grow our business
close to 15% a year, and for

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.690
many, many years we achieved
that growth.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.790
The private companies that owned
AIG stock were not owned

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.000
by AIG, but by the private
companies.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.330
We set up a structure, where
the private companies would

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.780
allocate some AIG shares
to individuals based on

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.310
performance.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.540
At the end of every two years,
if we hit the goals that we

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.500
had established, they'd have a
certain number of AIG shares

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.090
set aside for them that they
would get at retirement.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.020
So, it was golden handcuffs.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.090
If you left the company, you
left behind the shares that

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.760
were set aside for you.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.270
And these were worth an
awful lot of money.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.090
Very few people left
the company.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:51.270
I can assure you that it was
a great incentive to stay.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.360
The people we wanted to stay
are the ones that got

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.390
allocated shares obviously.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.300
It cost AIG nothing.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.790
The public shareholders of AIG
had no cost allocated to that,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.140
so the shareholders of AIG
benefited from that, and,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.150
obviously, the company
overall benefited

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.920
because they did so well.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.360
So, it was a great
organization.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.610
So what happened?

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.960
In 2000 --

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.090
in the meantime, we had
further diversified.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.120
Our life insurance business
grew dramatically.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.090
We bought a company called
SunAmerica, American General

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.220
Life, and so we became
a very major life

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.200
and non-life company.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.280
And then we wanted to expand
into financial

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.060
services, which we did.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.200
We had consumer finance.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.970
We had a thrift.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.490
All of which was done, because
we could benefit from all the

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:58.000
policyholders that we had, that
we cross-market from one

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.200
to the other.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.870
And so, it was natural
for us to do that.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.680
And we had close to $1 trillion
of assets to be

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.810
invested, obviously.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.230
And so, we had the funds and the
capital that we needed to

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.710
finance these new startups.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.070
And that was going quite well.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.540
One day I had a call from
Senator Ribicoff, who was a

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.660
Connecticut senator
at the time.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.980
And he wanted me to meet a young
fellow, who was running

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.680
a financial services business.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.060
He had been with Drexel
originally.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.100
And he came -- he was a very
bright guy -- he came to us.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.030
And we started something called
AIG Financial Products.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.800
It was a very successful
company.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.400
It did derivative business.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.050
Everything was hedged.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.660
It was a very successful
operation.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:27:00.710
He got a little greedy on one
point, and we separated.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:01.310
He left.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:07.300
We wanted him to leave. And we
put somebody else in, who was

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.610
a very, very good man.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.990
Most of these people were
all Ph.D.'s in math.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.420
They were a special breed.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.480
They were different, and in
order to ensure that we knew

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.140
what they were doing, we had a
mirror of all the computer

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.870
systems that they used for some
of the things that they

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.920
were doing.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.860
We got one off-site that
mirrored every transaction

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.250
that was being undertaken.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.800
We also had in the company what
they call an enterprise

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.930
risk management system, which
means we monitored both market

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.760
risk and credit risk throughout
our organization,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.680
because insurance is a risk
business to begin with, and

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.810
you have to monitor risk.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.470
So, that was part
of our nature.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.080
We understood risk.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.950
And knew how to balance it and
how to manage it in the

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.550
insurance business and the
financial business as well.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:18.970
After all, we had to invest $1
trillion of assets every year

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.870
and growing, so clearly we had
to know what we were doing.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.620
And I said it was a very
successful company.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.300
In 2000 and --

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:42.030
I guess it was 2004, the end of
2004, we were reporting our

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:46.930
earnings on a conference call
with analysts, and one of the

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.030
analysts asked me, what the
regulatory environment was

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.900
like today.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:04.270
And I said, it's like a foot
fault is like a murder charge,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.710
because things had changed
dramatically after Enron in

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.860
the United States.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:15.820
The regulatory system became
very, very difficult, and

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:22.700
anything at all really was being
exaggerated beyond what

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.520
you can just believe.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:31.740
The next day we got a subpoena
from Eliot Spitzer, who then

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.690
was the Attorney General
in New York.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:40.490
And I should say a word about
this, because there was a

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:45.750
major change in the regulatory
environment after Enron, and

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:50.020
in some states, in New York
particularly, the Attorney

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.230
General's office has
been used as a

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.000
platform to run for governor.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.500
It became a politicized
office.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.620
And Spitzer had gone after me.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.460
He went after my son, Jeff,
who was running Marsh &amp;

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.370
Mclennan, the largest insurance
brokerage firm in

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.000
the United States.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.936
He went after Sandy Weill, who
was running Citigroup.

00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:27.960
He went after Merrill Lynch,
all to promote himself as

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.880
attorney general who
was helping the

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.030
people, quote, unquote.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.900
He destroyed several hundred
billion dollars of value, is

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.520
what he did.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.220
He got elected governor, and you
know the outcome of that.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.220
It was a very short tenure.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:55.130
He got caught with prostitutes
and had to resign.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:31:01.540
But he left behind a lot
of broken companies.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:07.000
I was forced to leave, because
he threatened the board of

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.460
directors of AIG, that, if I
didn't leave the company, he

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.710
was going to indict
the company.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:21.700
He went on national TV, and
accused me of accounting fraud

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.850
in the company.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.190
Just before Thanksgiving, he
dropped all those charges,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.630
because nobody reads the
newspapers the night before

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.000
Thanksgiving.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.250
He was a bad actor.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:42.370
So, I left the company
in 2005.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.290
The outcome was that --

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.740
the plan actually had been that
I would step down as CEO

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:55.430
in May of that year at the
annual meeting, and remain as

00:31:55.430 --> 00:32:00.710
chairman, and see how the
successor team would work.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.580
At that point, we had
92,000 employees,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.720
and not a small company.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.190
To make sure that the new
management team would be able

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.070
to handle the diverse businesses
that we were in.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.880
These were all experienced
people.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.390
There was nobody new
in that role.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.430
I believe that we wanted it to
have the new team come from

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.250
within the company,
not from outside.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.590
Because they had to understand
what we were.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.810
And we had a culture in the
organization that was quite

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.590
unique, and you can't just
change the culture of a

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.380
company instantly.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.160
You build a culture over
many, many years.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.840
In any event, I was out.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.750
A new chap came in, Martin
Sullivan, who had been a

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.080
senior man in the organization
for years.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.820
He attended every senior staff
meeting that we had for years.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.890
We had several different --

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.280
I won't go through all of that
-- but several senior

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.200
management meetings that were
critical to knowing, what was

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.500
going on throughout
the organization

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.460
on a real-time basis.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.370
We'd meet every Monday
morning.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:22.500
About 15 people represented
the entire organization.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.650
They'd be reporting on
everything that was happening

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.110
on a real-time basis.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.600
We did the second meeting,
held on a Wednesday every

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:38.540
morning, that dealt with hedging
full-time, and risk

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.505
management.

00:33:39.505 --> 00:33:45.670
And those two subjects were on
a real-time basis weekly.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.100
And, of course, there were
people working on that on a

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.390
daily basis.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.260
But anything that was out of the
ordinary would be surfaced

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.050
at these meetings.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.050
For some reason or other, he
discontinued those meetings.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.000
I can't understand
why, but he did.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.630
And what's very disturbing is,
that the audit committee of

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.530
AIG's board knew that and
did nothing about it.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.840
The outcome of that was then,
that AIG Financial Products

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.560
loaded up on credit
default swaps.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.550
They did more credit default
swaps in the nine months after

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.820
I left the company than we
had done in seven years.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.040
Now, let me say something about
credit default swaps,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.274
because I think it
is important.

00:34:32.274 --> 00:34:37.710
A credit default swap originally
was created, so

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.780
that, if a security --

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:48.890
in this case CDOs, which was
really a product that was

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:52.360
mostly real estate put together,
and packaged and

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.660
sold as a CDO --

00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:01.850
originally, those instruments
had to have a default before a

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:06.410
CDS, a credit default swap,
would respond to that

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.410
instrument that defaulted.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:15.710
Someplace along the line, that
was changed, so that you

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.010
didn't have to --

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.120
the instrument didn't
have to default, it

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.060
simply had to lose value.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.120
And you had to put up
collateral, the one who issued

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.370
the credit default swap had to
put up collateral equal to

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.520
what the loss of value --

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.830
even though it wasn't realized,
on what the CDO had

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.270
lost in value.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:48.530
That change played a major role
in what happened in the

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:53.490
recession that we've just been
going through, particularly on

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.070
Wall Street.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.830
Putting up more collateral meant
you had to have a lot of

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.420
cash on hand.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:08.150
No matter how big you were, it
became a very important issue,

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.920
as to the ultimate demise of
several companies, including

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.175
the problems that
AIG ran into.

00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:18.750
They were called on for billions
and billions of

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.310
dollars of collateral,
which ultimately --

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.680
I don't care how big you
are, you run out of

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.860
cash, which they did.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.300
One of the problems was in
trying to determine what is

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:41.990
the value of a CDO, since there
was no price discovery,

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.510
because there was no exchange
in what you

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.450
traded the CDOs on.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.050
That was, strangely enough,
during the Clinton

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.010
administration, the Treasury
Department, then run by Bob

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:04.370
Rubin, turned down the question
of having an exchange

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.890
and regulating credit
default swaps.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.490
So, you had a situation where
every broker dealer had a

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.640
different price for a CDO.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.670
And how much collateral did you
really need to put up, if

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.010
you couldn't tell what
the price of one was.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.010
In this instance, Goldman Sachs
had the lowest price of

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.130
any CDOs that were being called
on for collateral.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.420
And since AIG Financial Products
did a great deal of

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.310
business with Goldman Sachs,
they were being called on for

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.880
more and more collateral.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.230
They ran out of cash.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:49.700
Now, the insurance companies
were all very, very solvent.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.080
It's state-regulated.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.570
You can't just take their
capital for something else.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:38:00.030
They were protected, all the
policyholders were protected,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.710
under the fact that there was
state law and not federal law

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.150
that governed the insurance
companies.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.610
But AIG ran into the
difficulties.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.910
I was not in the company.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:17.380
I would have handled it much
differently had I been there.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.210
I would not have responded to
the call for collateral, when

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.700
you couldn't tell what the price
discovery really was.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.570
I would have said, you know --

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.430
And one other thing,
AIG was a AAA rated

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.470
company when I was there.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.240
The day I left the company,
it lost its AAA rating.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.810
So, if you were AAA rated,
you did not have to post

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.640
collateral.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.710
If you were not AAA rated, you
had to post collateral.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:55.200
So, AIG ran out of cash.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:02.070
So, they turned to
the Fed for help.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.685
You got to remember, this was
now in a time, when Bear

00:39:05.685 --> 00:39:09.450
Stearns first got in trouble.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:16.410
And they found a buyer in J.P.
Morgan, which really, J.P.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:21.590
Morgan got Bear Stearns for
nothing, practically.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.020
It was six months
in between Bear

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.640
Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.900
What did they do during that
six months, the government

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:37.690
that is, to prepare for any kind
of financial upheaval?

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:43.470
There was no plan to deal with
what was about to descend in

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.240
the financial markets in
the United States.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:52.320
So, Lehman Brothers, who could
have been saved by the Fed,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.000
was let to go down.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.080
And that caused a run on
virtually all the banks.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.970
The loss of confidence that
ensued, when Lehman Brothers

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:08.520
was let go into bankruptcy,
startled the financial world.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.470
And everybody that had any money
in any of the investment

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.240
banks, or banks, was
pulling money out.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.780
And so, there was a --

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.740
you couldn't borrow any money.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.760
The markets froze.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.020
And so, there was an ad hoc
approach to doing things.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:29.250
So, Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, both of which were

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.080
going to have a problem,
were given a bank

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.180
holding company license.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.800
That gave them access to the
Fed window, and they could

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.650
borrow money at virtually no
costs at all, practically.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.270
The Hartford Insurance Company,
here in Hartford, a

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.290
medium-sized company, was
also given a bank

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.320
holding company license.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.310
And AIG was denied one.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:00.350
So, AIG was left to really
find a solution.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.940
So, they went to the Fed, the
New York Fed, which I had

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:09.240
chaired, incidentally, for
about seven years before.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:14.290
So, I knew the people in
the Fed quite well.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:20.200
They borrowed $85 billion from
the New York Fed at 14.5%

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:26.080
interest. And the Fed
took 79.9% of the

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.150
equity of the company.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.170
So, they essentially
nationalized the company.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:41.650
Now, the money that AIG got,
the $85 billion, at these

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:47.890
terms, which is outrageous, they
then had to pay the CDOs

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.880
that you couldn't tell what the
real price was, because

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.020
there was no price discovery.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:59.420
You could have negotiated the
value of those at about $0.40

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.840
to $0.60 on the dollar, but
the Fed made them pay 100

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.790
cents on the dollar.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:10.340
So, AIG borrowed the money, paid
Goldman Sachs and others

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.840
100 cents on the dollar,
and had to pay that

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.760
money back to the Fed.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.020
So, things began to unravel
very quickly after that.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.010
They obviously lost
credibility in the

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.380
marketplace.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.150
They were losing business
left and right.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.780
They had to pay back
the government.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.930
So, one thing led to another.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:39.840
The Treasury put in a man by
the name of Ed Liddy to run

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.130
the company.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:45.410
He'd be on nobody's list
to succeed running AIG.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.500
He hadn't got a clue
how to do that.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.470
And they began to sell off
assets of AIG, really at

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.220
prices that were just
outrageous.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.200
So, the outcome is, that
AIG is a shadow

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.760
of what it had been.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.650
The government now
owns 92% of AIG.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.830
They want to sell that 92%.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.880
It'll take at least, in my view,
three to four years,

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.286
because it's an overhang.

00:43:17.286 --> 00:43:23.180
If they sell 10%, everybody
knows there's another 80% to

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:28.270
be sold, and so the stock
will go no place.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.670
So, do I feel bitter about it?

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.410
Yes I do.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.160
I feel very bitter about it.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.570
So, what am I doing?

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.010
I'm running C.V. Starr &amp; Co.
and Starr International.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.450
We're building it back into
a major organization.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:51.870
When I left AIG, C.V. Starr
&amp; Co. had 300 people.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.220
We're about 1000 right
now, so we're adding

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.660
employment to the country.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.350
And that's coming along.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.890
We've formed three new
insurance companies.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.650
We're doing business in
probably about 30

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.200
countries right now.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.470
We have a big Lloyd's
operation.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:15.465
We operate throughout
the European market.

00:44:15.465 --> 00:44:17.700
I'm going to China next week.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:23.530
We'll have a joint venture in
China by the end of April.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.370
We'll be in Southeast Asian
countries, all of which we

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.080
know for years and years.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.590
And we have a big investment
operation.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.000
I'm giving you a shorthand
version of

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.750
what really is happening.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.394
How much time do I got?

00:44:41.394 --> 00:44:42.780
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Nine or ten minutes.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.760
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
All right.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:53.770
So, I think there's a lot to
be just thinking about.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:58.390
Why did we get into this
trouble in the country?

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.690
What's this about?

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.170
How could a country as wise
as we are, and financially

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:10.960
literate as we are,
do what we did?

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.900
And I have my own thoughts about
that, but let me just

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.440
rattle some of the reasons
off their thing.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.030
There was a desire in this
country, during the Clinton

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:24.540
Administration, that housing
should be an

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.620
opportunity for everybody.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.550
Everybody should have the
right to own a home.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.430
There wasn't much
differentiation, whether you

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.890
can afford one or not.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:41.620
Historically, in our country,
mortgages were granted by

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.800
local banks, who knew the
individual, and would work

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.220
with that individual, if they
got into any trouble.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.830
When the Clinton administration
decided to

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.730
expand housing, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac were buying

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.150
mortgages from these
local banks.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:04.380
And local banks only serviced
the mortgage, but they really

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.610
didn't have any financial
involvement after the

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.510
mortgage was sold.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.740
And clearly many people got
mortgages in homes that

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.740
couldn't afford it.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.970
So, that was one thing, that
was going to lead up to,

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.290
ultimately, a problem.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:28.850
Second, investment banks in
the United States were

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:35.095
leveraging their capital
30 and 40 times.

00:46:35.095 --> 00:46:36.910
It was outrageous.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:41.040
Going from, say, five and six
times, or seven times your

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.920
capital to 40 and 50 and 30
times your capital, was

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.630
obviously a risk that shouldn't
have been taken.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.300
The SEC just ignored
that fact.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.950
Why?

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.780
It's hard to understand.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.790
But it was clear that it was
setting in motion some

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:04.190
conditions that would be very
difficult to live with on a

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.210
real-time basis.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.420
And, of course, it was going
to cause problems.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:15.010
Then, some of these investment
banks said, look, our job is

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.500
to be creative and
create products.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.870
So, they took some of these
mortgages that were being now

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:27.720
written for people, who didn't
have, really, the

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.600
right to own a home.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.840
They just didn't have
the financial needs.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.082
They didn't have the financial
background for it.

00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:38.790
And they packaged these
mortgages into a product.

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:41.640
They took mortgages, they said,
from the east to the

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.540
west to the south, and
the northeast,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.250
put them all together.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:53.240
They said, the diversification
is terrific, and that means,

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.480
it'll be marked AAA.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.890
They went to the rating
agencies, and sold the rating

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:03.490
agencies, Moody's and
the rest, that this

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.280
diversification --

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.280
they deserve a AAA rating.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.470
And the rating agencies
accommodated them, didn't do

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:16.580
very much analysis of their own,
and they were marked AAA.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.300
And they sold these mortgages
then, these products, these

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.450
CDOs, to every client and
customer they could find all

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:26.130
around the world.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:29.420
And, of course, they
weren't AAA.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:36.890
And then, as I said earlier,
these credit default swaps,

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:41.780
that would respond to normally
a default, had been changed,

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.790
so that you responded to just
a reduction in value.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.100
It blew up in everybody's
face.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.910
The same time they were doing
all of this, the Accounting

00:48:54.910 --> 00:49:01.400
Principles Board, located here
in Connecticut, came out with

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.105
mark-to-market accounting.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.970
Couldn't have picked a worse
time to do that.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:14.360
And that marked balance sheets,
that you normally

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.920
would carry, say, at cost, or
held to maturity, where you

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.080
keep the value --

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.870
you had to mark it down
to a market value.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.280
And that destroyed capital

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.180
artificially in many instances.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.345
That never should
have happened.

00:49:31.345 --> 00:49:37.300
The SEC, who oversees
that, kept silent.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.770
So, you had all of these things
come together, at the

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:45.920
same time, that led to the
destruction that took place.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.300
There are other things
that happened.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.780
I could go through a list of
them, but I don't think the

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:57.360
real story, on what truly
occurred in our country, has

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.800
been fully recognized yet.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.270
Jelling will take a while.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.050
There have been a lot of books
written, but jelling on parts

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.060
of it, not the entire issue.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:13.330
I testified before a couple of
congressional committees on

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:16.660
this, particularly
on the AIG issue.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:22.590
For example, by what right did
the government have to take,

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:27.466
essentially, 92% of AIG?

00:50:27.466 --> 00:50:29.800
To me, it was an unlawful
taking.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.140
What should have been done, and
if you look at the other

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.260
companies that they aided --

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:44.050
they aided Citigroup and they
got about 30% of the equity.

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:47.120
That's different than 92%.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:52.120
And they aided several other
companies the same way.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:51:02.390
So, why was AIG set aside
and used the way it was?

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.390
AIG was a national asset.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:07.120
We have no insurance company
that operates

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.390
globally in 130 countries.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.760
When I tell you it was a
national asset, I know what

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.500
I'm talking about, because we
did many things that were

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.630
beneficial to our country
and our government.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:24.490
It was totally destroyed.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.690
They saved Goldman --

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:31.300
AIG was used to save many,
including Goldman Sachs.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.240
But that story will come out.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.980
It's been alleged already in
the newspapers, and in

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.766
articles, and magazines,
and you have it.

00:51:44.766 --> 00:51:50.558
But anyway, I think I'll stop
right here and take questions.

00:51:50.558 --> 00:52:12.540
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:18.457
STUDENT: So, when you were
talking about the culture of

00:52:18.457 --> 00:52:20.577
your organization, you mentioned
that you do not

00:52:20.577 --> 00:52:24.660
prefer having contracts
with your employees.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.000
And I'm wondering what that
means not to have contracts,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.890
and why do you do it?

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:30.753
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
I didn't quite understand.

00:52:30.753 --> 00:52:33.780
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
About your contracts.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.320
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Yeah.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.990
I didn't think that you ought
to hold and have a contract,

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.660
that you stay if you weren't
doing the job.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:45.610
But you have to start
someplace and it

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.460
started with me.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.490
I refused a contract.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.410
I thought that, if I wasn't
doing the job, I shouldn't be

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:55.070
forced to stay in the company.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.380
They should have the right
to have a new CEO,

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.530
so I turned it down.

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:02.450
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Is
that because the contract

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:04.370
couldn't be explicit?

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:05.700
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Well, no.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.870
Say, that, if you have a
five-year contract, at the end

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.980
of three years, if the company's
not doing well, why

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.900
should the company be
forced to keep you

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.150
for two more years?

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.710
If you don't ask me
a question, I'll

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:30.960
ask you some questions.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:43.976
STUDENT: I guess, this is more
of a personal question.

00:53:43.976 --> 00:53:45.654
I was wondering what --

00:53:45.654 --> 00:53:49.566
so, we're all in school, and
we don't have jobs yet.

00:53:49.566 --> 00:53:52.030
And so, in thinking about
careers, it's an important

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.100
decision, so, I wondering
what made you

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.150
really enjoy your job.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.690
Was it the success you had?

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:59.640
Was it the day-to-day
activities?

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.260
Was it the impact you made
on being part of AIG?

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:05.510
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Well, I

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:06.500
think it's many things.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.900
You have to love what you
do, to begin with.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.070
And I love building.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.220
And I loved working with the
group of people that we had.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.260
It was a very close group.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.370
And it's a lot of fun opening
new markets, and beating our

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.980
competitors.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.830
It was a very satisfying
experience.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.940
And you have to love it.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.210
The other thing I would say,
you need a lot of energy.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:35.710
You have to want -- you know,
work should not be viewed as,

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:39.610
say, from nine to five.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.130
You work as long as you have to
because you love doing it.

00:54:55.078 --> 00:54:58.580
STUDENT: It also kind of reminds
me of Bear Stearns,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:03.076
and another very experienced
chairman, Ace Greenberg, kind

00:55:03.076 --> 00:55:04.820
of warning his board--

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.013
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
I'm not hearing you.

00:55:07.013 --> 00:55:08.897
STUDENT: This is on?

00:55:08.897 --> 00:55:12.200
Like, AIG, the story of AIG
really reminds me of Bear

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:12.697
Stearns' fall.

00:55:12.697 --> 00:55:16.156
And of a really experienced
board member pointing out that

00:55:16.156 --> 00:55:18.920
what the company was
doing wasn't great.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:23.980
So, can you talk to, I guess,
the idea of having experience

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.570
in this field, and the fact that
companies were kind of --

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.560
boards weren't working, was
also a core problem of the

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.420
financial crisis.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.274
So, can you tell me a little
bit more about that and how

00:55:34.274 --> 00:55:36.570
you felt afterwards?

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.140
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
I didn't quite hear that.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.540
Did you hear?

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:39.910
PROFESSOR ROBERT
SHILLER: Boards

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:43.390
were not working properly.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:44.550
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Boards were not working

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.535
properly is absolutely right.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.620
There was a lead director
in the company --

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:57.210
if you go back through the
history of AIG, we had some

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.950
outstanding people
on the board.

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:04.410
Over a period of time, some
retire, some die.

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.470
But we had a pretty
good board.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.850
Carla Hills, for example, was
on the board, and she was an

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.460
outstanding director.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:19.390
She had been in the cabinet of
George Bush, the first. She

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:22.850
was a terrific director.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.620
Bill Cohen, who had
been secretary of

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.920
defense, was a director.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.320
Dick Holbrooke, who recently
died, was a director.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.020
So, we have had some
good directors.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.630
On the other hand, when
Spitzer threatened the

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:44.600
company, many of them
just folded.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:49.270
Not Carla Hills and not Bill
Cohen, but many others.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.350
And you don't know, how people
are going to respond until

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:57.730
they're confronted
with an issue.

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.270
But there's no question that
the board failed, in my

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:03.730
judgment, to recognize what was
happening after I left.

00:57:13.078 --> 00:57:15.538
STUDENT: So, China has recently
been experiencing

00:57:15.538 --> 00:57:16.522
rapid growth.

00:57:16.522 --> 00:57:19.551
How do you think their growth,
the change toward a

00:57:19.551 --> 00:57:20.778
consumption model,
will change the

00:57:20.778 --> 00:57:24.372
insurance industry in China?

00:57:24.372 --> 00:57:26.136
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: China,
you're saying, has been

00:57:26.136 --> 00:57:26.840
growing rapidly.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.840
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
What is?

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.031
STUDENT: How will
that change the

00:57:29.031 --> 00:57:31.655
insurance industry in China?

00:57:31.655 --> 00:57:33.812
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: The
insurance industry in China,

00:57:33.812 --> 00:57:39.260
how is it changing with
their rapid growth?

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.550
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
It's changed dramatically.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.780
The largest insurance company in
the world today, by market

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.710
value, is China Life.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:53.040
Amazing growth in China,
and you expected it.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.090
China has passed the United
States in the number of

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.540
automobiles being sold a year.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.430
They all have to be insured.

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.820
So, the growth in the insurance
industry in China is

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.070
very rapid.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:15.990
Very immature in many ways in
understanding risk, but

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.900
that'll change.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.280
They've come a long ways.

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.260
When I first went to China,
and we entered our life

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.360
company, the life insurance
industry in

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.700
China was very small.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.480
And they didn't have agents
selling life insurance.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:37.350
They had their employees
selling life insurance.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:43.020
So, if an employee sold
something, he would get paid,

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.110
and he'd get paid whether
he sold or not.

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.340
So, they had a fixed expense.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.660
We introduced an agency system
in China, and recruited

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.480
thousands of agents.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.780
And they got commissions,
if they sold something.

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:02.350
If they didn't sell, they
didn't get a commission.

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:05.760
The Chinese companies quickly
adapted to our system.

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.320
So, you can say that we created
millions and millions

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.810
of jobs in China.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.020
STUDENT: Thank you.

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.560
I'm just wondering what you do
you think of Chartis and

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.870
SunAmerica, currently
sub-businesses, and how you

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:26.860
would evaluate Robert Benmosche
as the current CEO.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.990
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Look, I've known Bob Benmosche

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:32.860
for 15, 20 years, and
he's a decent man.

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.360
He's a good man.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.140
And he's, I think, a
pretty good leader.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.360
He has very little experience
internationally, and his

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.300
experience has been in the life
insurance sector, not in

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.780
the non-life sector.

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:53.990
One of the largest components of
AIG is the non-life sector,

00:59:53.990 --> 01:00:00.090
so he's got a hard job
in front of him.

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:04.110
Also, the most valuable
assets have been sold.

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:10.580
The AIA, which is the company
that's entered in China, that

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.740
AIG owns 100% of, they
sold that, which I

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.865
wouldn't have done.

01:00:16.865 --> 01:00:21.910
And they sold American Life
to Metropolitan Life.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:25.780
That company does business in 55
countries around the world.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.560
You can't replicate that.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.280
I wouldn't have sold that.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.050
So, AIG is a shadow of
what it was before.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:36.970
Benmosche's got a tough job.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.360
He doesn't know the non-life
business very well.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.440
And the culture of the
company is gone.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.610
Most of the people who worked
there, who were some of the

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.160
better people, have left.

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:57.060
Many have come to me, and are
working in C.V. Starr &amp; Co.,

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.505
and in our agencies and our
insurance companies.

01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:05.390
It's going to be a tough job,
but he's a good man.

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:08.750
I like him.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.160
STUDENT: Good morning.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.660
During your speech, you get to
the destructive power of

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.420
credit default swaps.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.228
And what I find interesting is,
different countries have

01:01:18.228 --> 01:01:19.570
taken a very different
approach.

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:22.390
Some European countries have
absolutely banned credit

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:23.300
default swaps.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.570
China, most notably, introduced
them in the market

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.720
recently, but put a cap
on the value with

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.410
the underlying amount.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.413
So my question really is, what
sort of regulation do you

01:01:33.413 --> 01:01:36.480
think would work well, both
at a national level and,

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.560
possibly, the international
level?

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.280
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
That's a good question.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.400
I would do at least
two things.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.810
First, I would go back to where
a credit default swap

01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:51.530
would only respond if the
underlying instrument, that it

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:55.960
is supposedly insuring,
defaults.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.230
In other words, I would not
respond to just a reduction in

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:06.480
value, because if you look at
all those CDOs, that the

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.750
credit default swaps were
covering, most of those have

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.050
recovered in value.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:16.750
OK, so that there was a
temporary reduction in value,

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.140
but they didn't default.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.540
And so, what it led
to was unnecessary

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.150
chaos in the market.

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:29.400
The second thing, I would have
is an exchange, where you get

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.760
price discovery.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.785
Without price discovery, you're
back where you were,

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:36.840
and so you have to have that.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.270
And you'd have to
put up reserves.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.950
If I was going to issue credit
default swaps, you ought to

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:42.660
reserve it.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.370
If it's going to be an insurance
instrument, treat it

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.270
like an insurance instrument.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:51.980
And make the underlying company,
who's issuing them,

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.230
put up reserves.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.300
STUDENT: It can be a bit
intimidating sometimes to

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.840
hear, or learn, or read about
the insurance industry because

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.590
of the regulation, and the
billions and billions of

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.340
dollars that are always
involved, et

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.370
cetera, as a student.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.490
But I'm wondering, in addition
to what you're doing yourself

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:19.310
now, with C.V. Starr, what
opportunities do you see for

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.830
entrepreneurship in
the insurance

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.170
industry today, if any.

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.770
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Well, I think there's

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:28.680
tremendous opportunity for
being an entrepreneur.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.100
You know, you're living in a
changing world, changing

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.080
economies, new products
are being invented and

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.940
developed every day.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.110
And investments are going
on in different

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.310
parts of the world.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.440
All of that needs insurance.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.510
And so, there's great
opportunity to be creative in

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:50.950
the insurance industry, and
differentiate yourself from

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:52.440
everybody else.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.030
I'm about to do a joint venture

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.490
insurance company in China.

01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:59.080
The one we're doing a joint
venture with, a very

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.440
traditional company.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.750
We will change that in
less than a year

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.810
into something different.

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.450
And that's exciting
to do that.

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:11.960
So, I'm looking forward to it.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.480
STUDENT: Hi.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.370
Do you think that --

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.663
I mean, with the recent
financial crisis, we've seen a

01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:42.890
lot of government intervention
and interaction through the

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:43.610
private world.

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:46.595
And I was wondering, do you
think that the government

01:04:46.595 --> 01:04:49.840
should have any role, other than
just keeping things fair?

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.042
Do you think they should
intervene, when these

01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:53.247
companies are having
big issues, like

01:04:53.247 --> 01:04:55.900
what happened to AIG?

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:56.410
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Do I think

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:57.790
government should intervene?

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:00.630
I think that --

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.015
the least amount that's
necessary.

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:07.580
I think, if you're asking the
question of ''too big to

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:11.950
fail'', I think there are some
institutions that probably

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:15.170
would cause chaos
if they failed.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:21.230
But I would make that very,
very few and far between.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:27.540
What troubles me is, what
happened in this recession in

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.160
government intervention.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.690
They picked and chose who
they wanted to save

01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:33.410
and who they didn't.

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.885
It wasn't even-handed.

01:05:35.885 --> 01:05:41.710
It was done with the intent to
save some and not others.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.990
The real story of what
happened has not

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:47.800
been printed yet.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.485
After all, it's very common
knowledge that Paulson, who

01:05:51.485 --> 01:05:54.740
was then Treasury Secretary,
was surrounded by Goldman

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.500
Sachs people.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.640
I'm not making that up.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.930
That happens to be a fact.

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:09.360
And so, how objective were
they in what they were

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.510
deciding to do and not to?

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.140
I think that there are times
government has to intervene,

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:21.190
but I happen to believe in the
private sector, in the ability

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:24.900
of Americans to create
jobs and businesses.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.410
And government should
be small.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:29.020
Government created jobs
and not the best jobs.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.000
Private sector jobs are the
best jobs, in my judgment.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.080
STUDENT: Thank you.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.550
What role do you think that
banks should play in the

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:58.785
future to avoid a
similar crisis?

01:06:58.785 --> 01:07:02.130
And do you think that there
needs to be a different sense

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.260
of what risk is?

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.460
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
What was the last part?

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.802
STUDENT: What kind
of role should

01:07:07.802 --> 01:07:09.800
banks play in the future?

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.584
And do you think that there
needs to be a different

01:07:11.584 --> 01:07:13.600
definition of what risk is?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.030
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Of what risk is?

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:15.500
STUDENT: Risk.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.580
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG:
Yeah, OK.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.820
When you say banks, you have
to differentiate between

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.670
commercial banks and
investment banks.

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:28.730
Look, I think that the
Dodd-Frank bill, that has been

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:34.180
passed, comes up with a whole
new set of regulations.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.930
Let me touch on that
in a minute.

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:45.580
And will banks use their own
capital to do transactions

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.495
that put the whole institution
at risk?

01:07:49.495 --> 01:07:52.890
It probably will not
be the way it was.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:58.290
I think the Volcker Rule, which
would limit the amount

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:01.200
of individual transactions
that might

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.960
endanger the bank --

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.300
they are going to be limited.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:08.130
It'd have to use an off-balance
sheet approach, so

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:11.290
that that doesn't pollute
the rest of the bank.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:15.180
Investment banks, for example,
that may have done

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:20.060
transactions, that bet against
their own clients, I think

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.439
should be outlawed.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.939
If an investment bank is selling
me, say, invest in the

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:31.330
XYZ CDO, and then they take a
position against that, it

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.210
seems to me that
that's immoral.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:37.189
And that should not
be permitted.

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:42.790
Now, the Dodd-Frank bill was
enacted, before they even had

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.479
any of the response of all
the investigations

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:47.870
that were going on.

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:51.410
It seems to me, they should have
waited and hear what the

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:54.189
investigators had come
up with, before they

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:57.109
passed a new law.

01:08:57.109 --> 01:09:03.729
Now, Congress has to provide for
the financing of all these

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:07.540
new regulators that are going
to be created under the

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.670
Dodd-Frank bill.

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:11.100
And I'm not sure that's
going to happen.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.850
I'm not so sure that all
of them are necessary.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.700
What we need are better
regulators, not more

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.990
regulation.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:18.279
We had plenty of regulation.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.189
If they had enforced the
regulations that were in

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:23.300
existence, we would have avoided
a great deal, if not

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.550
all, of what took place.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.350
STUDENT: Hi.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:44.640
You mentioned earlier about how
AIG attracted and retained

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.540
the best people in the business,
and that's how they

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.140
grew, because of the strong
culture there.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.790
But if you're starting a new
company, or even entering in a

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.785
management position at a current
company, how do you go

01:09:56.785 --> 01:09:59.250
about building that type
of culture that

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.807
just fosters growth?

01:10:00.807 --> 01:10:03.192
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: How do
you build the culture that

01:10:03.192 --> 01:10:05.100
you have talked about?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.455
MAURICE ''HANK'' GREENBERG: The
culture starts at the top.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.620
It's got to start with the

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.050
individual running the company.

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:17.480
The same thing, as I say,
in risk management.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.910
The CEO is the top risk manager
in the company.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.580
You have other people
involved, but

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.770
you're the risk manager.

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:26.950
You decide, how much risk
you really want to take.

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:29.410
And the same thing is
true in culture.

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:32.540
You build a culture based upon
your performance, what you

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:36.230
stand for, what you believe in,
and you surround yourself

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:38.630
with people who share
those beliefs.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.610
If they don't, they'll
feel out of step.

01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:46.465
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
All right.

01:10:46.465 --> 01:10:48.272
Thank you very much.

01:10:48.272 --> 01:10:50.006

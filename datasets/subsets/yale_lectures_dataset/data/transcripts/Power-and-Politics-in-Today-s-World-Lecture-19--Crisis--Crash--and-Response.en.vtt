00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.400
- So,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.000
today, we're talking about
crisis, crash and response.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.660
So just to remind us of where we were

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.983
in September of 2008.

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:26.900
- [Narrator] This is gonna
be one of the watershed days

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.180
in financial markets history.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.000
- [Narrator] It was a manic
Monday in the financial markets.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.520
The Dow tumbled more than 500 points

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.870
after two pillars of the street
tumbled over the weekend,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.900
Lehman Brothers, a 158 year old firm,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.244
filed for bankruptcy.

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:44.227
- I don't think anyone really expected

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.418
a bank as big as Lehman to, you know

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:47.970
be in a position that it's in now.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.240
- [Narrator] Brought down
by bad mortgage investments.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.330
Lehman which has 25,000
employees will be liquidated.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.643
- Am starting to another job.

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:57.310
- [Narrator] Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.020
fearing it could be next,
agreed in an active desperation

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.060
to a shotgun marriage
with Bank of America.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.210
Merrill, the country's biggest brokerage

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810
with 60,000 employees has been battered

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.810
by nearly $50 billion in
mortgage related losses.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.860
- It is definitely a
very, very difficult time

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.850
and it's not gonna get better quickly.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.290
- [Narrator] So in just six months,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.030
three of the five
biggest independent firms

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.400
on Wall Street have now disappeared.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.680
Bear Stearns, which collapsed last spring,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.970
Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.720
Treasury secretary Henry Paulson

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.280
tried to reassure investors today,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.850
- The American people can remain confident

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.570
in the soundness in the resilience
of our financial system.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450
- [Narrator] Paulson
attempted to broker a deal

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.260
to sell Lehman over the weekend.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.880
But unlike the buyout
deal for Bear Stearns,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.590
the government would not offer
any financial guarantees.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
- I never once considered
that it was appropriate

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.149
to put taxpayer money on the line

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.820
in resolving Lehman Brothers,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.807
- it would have required an $85 billion

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.575
subsidy to keep afloat.

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.670
- [Narrator] Insurance
giant AIG is the next name

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.320
on the list of troubled companies.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.560
It's looking for $40
billion in bridge loans.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.510
Veteran trader Art Cashin believes

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.620
there could be more casualties.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.860
- This is the fifth time
we've seen this movie.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.680
And you sit on the edge of your seat

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.648
and you yell at whichever character it is.

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.793
Don't go into that woodshed
it was they keep going in.

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:27.430
- So,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.920
he was understating things
that of course at the time,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550
anytime the treasury of
the secretary comes out

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.750
on national television to assure you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.700
that the financial system
is fundamentally sound,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.050
you know that people are panicking,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.113
and they indeed were.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.860
They were speculating at that time,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.450
the AIG bailout would cost $40 billion,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.703
it ended up costing four times that.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.790
And the crisis just stumbled on.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:05.339
And you know,

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.120
this is one of many pictures one could.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780
This is just the Dow
Jones Industrial Average,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.440
and you can see there
by the end of September

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.440
when banks were failing faster
than people could count them.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.870
And Hank Paulson, who you
saw there, Henry Paulson,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.750
he had been a former head of Goldman,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.570
and indeed he had led the group of bankers

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.890
in the run up to the financial crisis

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.750
that I told you about some time ago,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.870
who came and petition the SEC,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.590
under the tutelage at that time

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.050
of congressman Christopher Cox,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.140
on arguing that the biggest banks,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.770
those with assets in excess of 5 billion

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.060
could have relaxed capital requirements

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.780
because they were so big
that they could self insure

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.010
he was by now Secretary of the Treasury.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.490
And the reason this turns
out to be a significant date

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.650
is that

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.730
he had come to Congress
on the 29th of September,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.580
asking for 700 billion

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.280
to bail out failing banks.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720
And they had come with it
an extremely brief request

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120
for a blank check.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.260
And, of course,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.320
the congressional committees went crazy.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.570
And even though the Bush administration

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.300
had assured them that it was a done deal,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.640
and Congress would vote it up,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.070
they didn't vote it up.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.690
They voted it down.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.523
And,

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:51.410
the net effect of that was
that the following day,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.650
the Dow lost another 700 points

00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:58.050
and the catastrophe just kept on going.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.883
And of course,

00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:00.230
it wasn't just the Dow.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.070
If you wanna get some sense

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.403
of how rapidly wealth was evaporating,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.843
this you can see here from
the peak to the trough,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.860
basically $16.4 trillion in
household wealth disappeared.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.780
So people were absolutely stunned.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.610
They didn't think this could happen.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.273
I mentioned to you in an earlier lecture,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.500
Ben Bernanke's famous speech
about the great moderation

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.540
that where he had speculated

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.890
that the regulators
had finally figured out

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.820
how to tame the business cycle,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.260
and that things like this,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.930
we're not going to happen again.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.743
And just to give you a sense,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.203
I should say,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.680
everybody prime sufficiently
spoke that three days later,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.980
Congress did pass a version

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.630
of the TARP bailout.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.290
And, with much more regulatory oversight

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.510
and a promise, which turned
out not to be worth the paper,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.690
it was written on that this
wouldn't support institutions

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.710
that were paying bonuses.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.713
We'll hear more about that shortly.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.363
So Congress had passed,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.510
had passed the bailout.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.900
And later that month,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.900
just to give you a sense
of the intellectual shock,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.150
that was going through the elites,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.330
Alan Greenspan,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.640
who had been chairman of the Fed until

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:42.440
2006,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.760
and widely a being called the maestro

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.840
and the greatest genius.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.850
This is him, later in that same month,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.370
just two, three weeks

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.200
after Congress had finally
adopted the legislation,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.050
talking to the House Oversight

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.863
and Government Reform Committee.

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.070
[narrator] General with status...

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.440
- Those of us who have
looked to the self interest

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.700
of lending institutions to
protect shareholders equity,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.810
myself especially,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.490
are in a state of shocked disbelief.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.670
Such Counterparty surveillance
is a central pillar

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.780
of our financial markets state of balance.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.500
If it fails, as occurred this year,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.223
market stability is undermined.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.355
- You found a flaw in the reality...

00:07:30.355 --> 00:07:33.660
- Flaw in the model that I perceived

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.720
is the critical functioning structure

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.870
that defines how the world works,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.703
so to speak.

00:07:38.703 --> 00:07:40.170
- In other words, you found that

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:44.600
your view of the world your
ideology was not right.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.744
It was not working.

00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:46.860
- Precisely.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.670
No, that's precisely
the reason I was shocked

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.980
because I've been going
for 40 years or more,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.800
with very considerable evidence

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.059
that it was working exceptionally well.

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:59.370
- where do you think
you made a mistake then?

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.730
- I made a mistake in presuming

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.080
that the self interest of organizations,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.490
specifically banks and others,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.900
was such as that they were best capable

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.710
of protecting their own shareholders

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.613
and the equity and the firm's.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.620
- So there you have it
from the maestro himself

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.027
confessing how shocked he was,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.590
What I wanna do today is look at the 2008

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.363
and subsequent choices,

00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:31.806
first in historical perspective,

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:34.800
and then we're gonna bring to
bear some of the instruments

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.610
that political economists
used to talk about regulation,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.700
in thinking more analytically
about the choices.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.310
So just to give you a sense

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.940
of how this was unfolding,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.630
of course, this was
unfolding over the summer

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.650
and fall of 2008 when we were in the midst

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.720
of a presidential campaign.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.570
And Barack Obama had
been the unlikely winner

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.850
of the Democratic nomination
against Hillary Clinton

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.540
and was now doing battle
against senator John McCain,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.500
who was the Republican.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.333
And,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.513
during the height of the
crisis in September of 2008,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.290
when actually John McCain
had suspended his campaign,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.350
but Obama famously said,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.280
well, you need a president can do more

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.220
one thing at a time,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.190
so he didn't suspend his campaign,

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.930
but he came to Washington,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.626
and here you can hear him
opining on the circumstance.

00:09:37.626 --> 00:09:40.460
- Late this afternoon, I
talked to Senator Obama

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.163
about the bailout and his concerns.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.160
- Well, it's not exactly clear.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.720
What happened was when
I left Florida, landed,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.690
I had heard the news that
in fact the deal was there.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.472
People are not obviously
happy that we got here

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.540
in the first place and we
shouldn't have gotten here

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.300
in the first place.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.330
It's a consequence of speculator greed,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.840
but also Washington not paying attention,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.640
and regulators being asleep at the switch.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.330
So there's resistance.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.720
But there had been at
least some core principles

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.553
that were met.

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:17.970
I think that from the
Democratic perspective,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.200
we just wanna make sure
that this is helping

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.480
the small businessman make his payroll,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.700
people keeping their
money market accounts,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.783
that we don't see a cratering
of the credit markets

00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:30.500
that could end up leading
to enormous job loss.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.260
And obviously, it's pretty
frustrating for Democrats,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.270
having seen the mismanagement
that's been taking place

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.000
over the last several years,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.760
to feel like we've gotta step
in and get something done.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.228
But that's how I think
many of us feel that,

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:49.910
that we can't worry about how we got here.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.060
Now we've gotta take some serious steps.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.030
- We can't worry about how we got here.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.490
Now we've got to take some serious steps.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.810
And that we've very much
reflected the attitude

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.800
that Obama and the Obama White House

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.750
brought to this problem.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.583
He,

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:13.020
and if you can read all the pop books

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.430
about the early years of
the Obama administration,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.780
too big to fail is one excellent

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.510
one run siskins confidence, man is.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.460
Another, But basically,

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.570
they assume that the people

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.953
who were in the midst of the crisis

00:11:30.953 --> 00:11:34.590
were the people that knew how to fix it.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.720
And I should say right off the bat,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.467
they were not wrong about this,

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:41.880
in many respects, as we will see,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.470
but this meant that Obama took on people

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.560
who had been greatly
implicated in the deregulation

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.290
of Wall Street over the previous decade

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.400
and a half people like Larry Summers.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.860
And he appointed as his treasury
secretary Timothy Geithner.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.260
who often would be attacked
in congressional hearings

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.490
as being in bed with Wall Street banks

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.050
and being accused of being
a former investment banker,

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.020
in fact, it wasn't true of Geithner.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.870
Geithner had never been a banker.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.700
He had always been a bureaucrat,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.700
he had been chairman of the New York Fed

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.700
until Obama appointed him as
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:32.493
and so Geithner,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.020
took responsibility
for fixing the problem.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.780
And he did work very
closely with Wall Street.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.660
And as a result of this,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.330
he very much took this attitude

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.210
that we shouldn't worry
about how we got here.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.930
What we've got to do is think

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.010
about how to get out of it.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.680
And Obama, bet on him

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.680
to the extent that produced
some considerable grumbling

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.070
in the administration.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.470
And just to give you a sense,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.710
the following March now President Obama

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.503
out there defending Geithner's efforts,

00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:16.200
particularly after

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.930
the huge scandal had erupted,

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.293
that not only was AIG the
insurance giant being bailed out,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.240
in, as I said, some multiple

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.350
of what had been speculated
a few months earlier,

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.290
but they were paying
bonuses to their executives.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.873
So the administration was very much

00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:41.380
back on their heels and
here's President Obama,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.810
defending Geithner.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.740
- [Narrator] With anger
mounting over the bonuses

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.670
awarded to AIG executives,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.090
The President is defending
his administration's

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.700
handling of the fiasco.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.645
- Nobody here drafted those contracts.

00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:55.340
Nobody here

00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:00.380
was responsible for supervising AIG

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.240
and allowing themselves to
put the economy at risk.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.480
- [Narrator] AIG paid out $165 million

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.490
in bonuses last weekend.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.320
The federal government has propped up

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.910
the failed insurance
giant with $170 billion

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.330
in taxpayer money.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.710
And angry president says
the buck stops with him.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.120
Ultimately, I'm responsible.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.600
I'm the president of the United States.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.553
Nobody's working harder than this guy.

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:30.420
He is making all the right moves,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.290
In terms of playing a bad hand.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.040
- [Narrator] Despite
assurances from the president,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.150
Some has speculated that Geithner's job

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.350
could be in danger.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.660
In part because he couldn't persuade AIG

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.123
to cancel the payouts.

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:46.414
- So there you have it.

00:14:46.414 --> 00:14:50.990
President Obama had
embraced the TARP bailout

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.360
as a candidate,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.040
and indeed,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.485
the version of it that had been passed

00:14:56.485 --> 00:15:00.191
on the third of October in 2008,

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:04.599
it was when George W.
Bush was still president

00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:09.070
had to be passed up
substantially by Democrats.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.273
Most Republicans in the
House voted against it.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.210
And so the incoming administration

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.810
was very closely
associated with the efforts

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.810
to bail out the banks and to
protect the bankers and again,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.920
just to give you a
sense, a week after that,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.840
Obama came out onto the White House lawn

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.300
and defended Geitner.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.360
Here you can see here you can see him

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.960
being raked over the coals

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.560
in a congressional committee hearing.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.313
- Just last month, AIG paid
343 employees of AIG FP,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.100
their financial products division,

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.957
that created the financial
hole that AIG is in.

00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:58.000
And in turn a multi billion dollar bill

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.640
for American taxpayers of 56
million dollars in bonuses

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.260
and are slated to pay an
additional $162 million in bonuses

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.200
to 393 participants in the coming weeks.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.380
And there's more.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.510
A further bonus payments totaling
approximately 230 million

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.120
are due to 407 participants

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.710
at AIG Financial Products
Division in March 2010.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.640
This makes no sense to my constituents.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.570
This company claims to be
on the brink of disaster,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.280
and it's handing out bonuses.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.870
- I just wanna point out
that compensation practice

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.530
across the financial services industry

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.460
over the last years and decades,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.210
just got out of whack
with basic fundamentals

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.750
and people were paid for risks

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.470
that weren't captured in compensation.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.760
And part of what we do to
make sure this kind of crisis

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.800
doesn't happen in the future

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.460
is to change those basic incentives,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.450
and there's gonna be a role
for government doing that.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.740
Now, it's very important
that we make sure that

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.200
we're providing exceptional
assistance to these firms,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.760
that that assistance is going again

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.380
to achieve the objectives
of these programs.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.180
Not to reward the kind of executives

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.440
that got us in this mess.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.460
I'm deeply committed to that objective.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.610
And we're gonna be as
careful and responsive

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.050
as we can to the concerns you have,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:09.970
so many Americans have

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.800
about how these resources have been used.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.160
And I just want to say
that the judgments made

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.190
by these boards of directors
and senior executives

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.430
across parts of the finances

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.650
have just caused a lot of
damage to public confidence

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.190
in the quality of their judgment.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.543
And they have a deep
responsibility and obligation

00:17:26.543 --> 00:17:29.460
to make more careful
judgments going forward.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.230
But we're not gonna
depend on them to do it,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.540
we're gonna make sure
that there's conditions

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.430
that come with our
assistance to assure that.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.890
So we're gonna figure out how
to apply these new provisions

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.600
in a way that is carefully
designed as possible.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.824
Obviously, we want these businesses

00:17:41.824 --> 00:17:44.403
to achieve the objectives of what we did

00:17:44.403 --> 00:17:45.620
in the AIG, we want them to be able

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.930
to run their business and restructure,

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.070
so we're in a better
position going forward.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.720
And,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.743
that's why this is sort of hard to do.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.440
- So that gives you a flavor of him

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.020
trying to explain why they
had to bail these banks out

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.460
even though they were, in this case,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.460
AIG even though they were
paying these bonuses and it,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.660
in fact had been a big
fight in the White House,

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.750
Obama had been appalled by it and demanded

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.440
that they find a way to claw them back.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.540
But Geithner and Summers and others

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.210
said these are contractual obligations.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.360
We have to enforce contracts,
we can't renege on them.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.740
And so that view prevailed.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.290
And so this was the
catechized, if you like,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.690
behind the way in which
the Obama administration

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:43.690
essentially owned the regulatory
response to the crisis

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.820
in ways that would be costly
for them and their successes

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.243
in ways that they couldn't
appreciate at the time.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.820
Now, I said I wanted to supply
some historical perspective

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.410
on this response, to the crisis.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.700
And of course, this is the
biggest financial crisis

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.290
since the Great Depression.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.930
So the place to compare it with,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.200
or the events with which to compare it

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.890
and worth a little bit of reflection,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.840
is how is the response to the depression.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.863
So,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.870
in 1932, Franklin
Roosevelt won the election,

00:19:28.672 --> 00:19:29.505
and by the time,

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.160
by the time he won the election,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.710
in fact, the Hoover administration,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.490
people tend to run Hoover
and Coolidge together,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.130
by the way, big mistake.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.210
Hoover was a quite

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.420
a much more enlightened person

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.450
about macroeconomics,
among many other things

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.070
than his predecessor had been,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:55.070
and if you read the literature
on the Hoover administration,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:59.740
one of the things you
learn is that by 1930

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.450
30, 31

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.450
the administration was
actually trying to implement

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.500
much of what FDR would subsequently do.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.040
We can call it Keynesian

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.692
because the General Theory

00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:17.300
wasn't published until 1936.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.960
But essentially,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.140
many of the sorts of measures that

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.770
would subsequently be adopted

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.250
by the Roosevelt administration
were being pushed.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.040
American agriculture
had been in a recession

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.760
for over a decade

00:20:33.307 --> 00:20:36.920
before the crash of the
stock market in 1929.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.700
They had much higher unemployment

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.440
through the most of this period,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.730
topping 20% and they were looking for ways

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.610
to spend money and stimulate the economy

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.313
and after the election,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.230
Hoover begged Roosevelt to do what

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.440
we just saw Obama doing
after the 2008 election

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.010
to endorse in the name of
rescuing the American economy

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.740
to endorse the proposals

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.990
that the administration was pushing,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.810
which he knew.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.830
Roosevelt agreed with many off,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.610
and Roosevelt flatly refused.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.560
He said, this is your government.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.790
This is your crisis, you deal with it.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.470
And we should also remember
that this is in 1932,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.050
when the new administration
didn't take office

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.020
until the following March,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.900
so we're really talking about
a five month interregnum

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.010
during which Roosevelt
left the administration

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.177
essentially twisting in the wind

00:21:48.177 --> 00:21:52.890
and made it much more
difficult for them to,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.370
to see, to implement

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.570
the sorts of proposals
that would have stimulated

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.030
the economy or at least what
most people and certainly

00:22:09.084 --> 00:22:11.530
in the Hoover White House thought

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.140
would stimulate the economy.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.043
Finally in March of the following year,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.400
Roosevelt came in and passed a lot of what

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.590
we now think of as the first New Deal.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.380
And that's I think I said to you,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.530
when we were talking about welfare states,

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.100
the early part of the New Deal

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.350
had a lot of business acquiescence,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.443
if not business support,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.840
partly because of a fear
of communist influence

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.280
in American trade unions and
a worry that American workers

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.280
might indeed start to conclude
that they had nothing to lose

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.280
but their chains

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.720
and so there was some
thought among business elites

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.240
that they should support the New Deal

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.050
at least at the beginning,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.860
by 1935, that was pretty much over.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.210
If you look the Glass Steagall Act,

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.900
which had been passed in 1933,

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.124
which I'll say a little
bit more about shortly,

00:23:17.124 --> 00:23:20.460
they were already beginning
to lobby against it

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.850
and undermine at the Wagner
Act, protecting unions,

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.850
which was part of the raft
of legislation in 1935,

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.930
immediately drew very hostile
reactions from business.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.480
And the Social Security
Act was also producing,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.490
lobbying to cut back its implementation,

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.560
especially in the south.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.407
And so there was a real
confrontation by 1935

00:23:50.783 --> 00:23:55.100
between the Roosevelt
administration and business

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.700
and far from working with business to try

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.670
and end the depression.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.921
I'll give you a snippet of FDR's famous

00:24:04.921 --> 00:24:09.697
Madison Square Garden
speech in October of 1936.

00:24:09.697 --> 00:24:13.800
And I should say this is
after the administration

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.710
concreted type, contrary
to the usual outcomes

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.127
had picked up large numbers of seats

00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:24.560
in the midterm elections in 1934.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.230
And so they had big majorities
in the House and the Senate.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.390
And this is FDR, campaigning,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.720
speaking in Madison Square
Garden in October of 1936,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:41.403
and a runner to his reelection.

00:24:43.306 --> 00:24:46.917
- [FDR] We have to struggle
with the old enemies

00:24:46.917 --> 00:24:50.417
of peace, business and financial monopoly,

00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:55.790
speculations, reckless
banking, class antagonism,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.353
sectionalism, war profiteering.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.417
They had began to consider the government

00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:05.020
of the United States as a mere appendage

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.500
to their own affairs.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.500
And we know now that
government by organized money

00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:18.724
is just as dangerous as
government by organized mob

00:25:19.175 --> 00:25:21.925
(crowd cheering)

00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:33.540
Never before in all our history,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.064
have these forces been so united

00:25:37.064 --> 00:25:40.940
against one candidate as they stand today.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.750
They are unanimous in their hate for me,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.672
and I welcome their hatred.

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:50.505
(crowd cheering)

00:25:54.825 --> 00:25:57.667
- [FDR] I should like to have it said

00:25:57.667 --> 00:26:00.485
of my first administration,

00:26:00.485 --> 00:26:03.568
that in it, the causes of selfishness

00:26:04.434 --> 00:26:07.601
and of lust for power met their match.

00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.657
I should like to have it said,

00:26:10.657 --> 00:26:11.610
(crowd cheering)

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.538
- [FDR] Wait a minute,

00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:13.371
(crowd cheering)

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.970
- [FDR] I should like to have it said

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.090
of my second administration

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.368
that in it, these forces met their master.

00:26:21.368 --> 00:26:24.201
(crowd cheering)

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.520
- So there you have it.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.520
FDR and he did indeed he
coasted to reelection.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.587
Again, keeping huge, significant
majorities on Capitol Hill.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.040
And the contrast with
the Obama administration

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.430
is pretty stark.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.180
Again, if you go back and
read the popular books

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.653
about the administration.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.120
Actually the bankers were stunned

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.580
that more was not demanded of them.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.880
When they met with various officials

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.420
from the administration,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.830
they were quite taken aback
at how how little was in fact,

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.660
being demanded of them.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.660
And particularly in these areas
of executive compensation,

00:27:21.883 --> 00:27:25.230
which were obviously going
to be politically toxic

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.160
in the way they turned out to be.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.230
But before we leave the Great Depression

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.990
and the Roosevelt administration,

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.990
it is important to say that
Contrary to popular belief,

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.760
among many on the American left,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.283
actually, the New Deal did
not end the depression.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.500
The New Deal policies were
not particularly effective.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.177
And indeed if you look at
another big recession in 1938

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.560
What really ended the
Depression was World War Two.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.880
The war economy ended the
depression is now today

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.230
the pretty widespread
consensus among historians.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.210
So even though it politically
of course what FDR did

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.190
was absolutely brilliant, it's not clear

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.505
how effective the new deal was

00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:25.650
in dealing with the depression.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.280
That's not to say it
wasn't desirable policy

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.240
for longer term reasons to
build a social safety net

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.580
and a welfare state.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.580
But it was not an, the Roosevelt
administration did not have

00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:44.892
any policies that worked
particularly to end depression.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.450
And indeed, if you are
a hard boiled Keynesian,

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.923
he was quite haphazard.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.380
He had two brains trust one
in Columbia that was much more

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.270
what we would think of as proto-Keynesians

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.240
and then hard money people in Harvard

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.850
giving him conflicting advice.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.670
And he was something of a push-me-pull-you

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.550
and he was in 1938,

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.990
they actually they reduce spending.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.770
So it's not as if

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.860
they had sort of the keys
to the policy solutions.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.780
And from that point of view,

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.620
if you could say that the Roosevelt

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.960
response to the Depression
was perhaps brilliant politics

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.740
and important for the
longer run in but was not

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.150
a particularly effective solution

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.670
to the depression,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.180
maybe nothing would have been

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.600
but certainly what they did wasn't.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.600
So let's now come back
to 2008 and the response.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.663
And there were several
pieces to the response.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.440
The first is that the Fed

00:29:58.106 --> 00:30:02.557
under the direction of Geithner and others

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.673
really did,

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.160
they stopped the US and
global liquidity meltdown.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.770
I underlined global on that slide,

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.830
in deference to Adam Tooze's

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.817
excellent book crashed

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:21.800
published about a year and a half ago,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.190
in which he documents to a degree

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.370
that had not been fully appreciated before

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:32.370
how much the Fed not only
bailed out the US economy,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.960
but he created global liquidity

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.160
over a period of a number
of years in Europe,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.720
in Asia, in particular,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.633
trillions and trillions of
dollars of liquidity was created.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.320
Partly because the
Europeans found themselves

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.653
unable to do it.

00:30:54.531 --> 00:30:55.364
The,

00:30:55.364 --> 00:30:59.120
one important takeaway
from the financial crisis

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.120
is that in one respect a lot
of mantras about globalization

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.210
and transnational institutions and so off,

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:13.210
turned out to be vastly
exaggerated in that

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.950
the international financial institutions

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.600
did not have a very big role in fighting

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.566
the financial crisis and in Europe,

00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:27.730
the European Central Bank

00:31:29.206 --> 00:31:31.030
couldn't coordinate on policies.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.240
This is basically to Tooze's story.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.210
And so it felt to the Fed that
could act as a unitary actor

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:42.130
to essentially create and
maintain global liquidity

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.020
until the crisis finally subsided.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.090
And so as a technical matter,

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.370
preventing this great recession

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.300
from turning into a great depression,

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.190
a lot of the credit does
indeed belong to the Fed

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:02.270
and the truth is that
the real financial crisis

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.410
in the US system was three or four days

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.760
when it really looked
like the whole place,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.030
the whole thing might go to pieces

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.000
then there were a lot of chronic problems

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.490
and subsequent aftershocks and so on.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:19.180
But the fact is that the Fed took actions

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.430
that nobody could have contemplated taking

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.800
if they had been anybody to take them

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.570
during the Great Depression.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.880
Then a second piece of the response

00:32:34.904 --> 00:32:36.640
was the piece of legislation

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.250
called the economic emergency
economic Stabilization Act

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.130
better known as the TARP 700 billion.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.770
That was finally enacted, as I told you,

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.703
at the beginning of October in 2008.

00:32:52.972 --> 00:32:57.010
And that was largely for bailing
out insolvent institutions

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.130
for which merges could not be arranged

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:04.660
or sweetening the pot in
order to facilitate mergers

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.295
of financial institutions that otherwise

00:33:07.295 --> 00:33:09.593
would have gone bankrupt.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.537
Then that the next big
piece of the response

00:33:14.537 --> 00:33:17.440
was the Obama stimulus,

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.490
the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:25.490
so called, which started out
being priced at 787 billion,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.990
but ended up costing
more like 830 billion,

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.470
and that was stimulus money,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:38.470
Keynesian stimulus money to
try and get the economy going.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.810
And then, of course,

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.640
the last piece of the response

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.763
was financial services reform.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.780
The Dodd Frank law,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.780
Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.600
passed in July of 2010.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.100
We will not be able to
dig into all of this

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.620
in today's lecture and
the central question

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.620
I wanna talk about which fits
into the arc of the course,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.130
is what do these responses

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.490
to the crisis reveal?

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:15.850
What could have been done
differently, if anything,

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.360
and what were the downstream
effects of the way,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.020
in fact, they did respond.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.840
But first, I want to
introduce some concepts

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.390
from political science
and political economy

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:32.390
and use them as if you like lenses

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:37.300
for thinking about regulation
and regulatory reform.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.750
This is a course after all,
in which we're trying to keep

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.080
political science honest
by bringing history to bear

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.810
but also using the analytical
insights of political science

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:53.580
to think about historical developments.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.330
I wanted talk about the
three main perspectives

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.700
on regulation and then
we'll take a closer look

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.890
particularly at the Dodd Frank legislation

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.393
from the point of view of these.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.240
So the first, which I'm
calling technocratic regulation

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.300
really goes back to Pigou's
economics of welfare.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.070
He was one of the most
famous welfare economists

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.500
of the early 20th century.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.640
And this is when welfare
economics was thought of

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.020
as an explicitly normative enterprise.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.620
If you open the economics of
welfare and start reading it,

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.540
the first few paragraphs are all about

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.160
how to organize the economy,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.003
for improving the national welfare.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:48.030
And a lot of Pigou's work
was about regulation.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.240
But there's a certain innocence

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.310
to the whole tone of that book,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.910
in that he assumes that
there are right answers

00:36:02.087 --> 00:36:05.480
to regulatory conundrums
whether or not to regulate it,

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.040
how to regulate.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.750
And that they can be implemented

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.620
by somebody called a legislator.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.683
And indeed, a lot of the
early economics work.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.480
If you go back read papers from that era,

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.560
when they talk about regulation
they will in their models,

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.220
they'll be a legislator
who is going to do this

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.423
or not do this, that and the other.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.693
And so,

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.350
the idea is that there are
certain kinds of situation

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:40.010
where the economist
technician can figure out

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.900
that there's definitely a
problem in the market system,

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.423
and the regulation can fix it.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And indeed, there are some
examples of regulation,

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.220
where it's pretty clear what
the technocratic answer,

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.540
in fact is.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.540
So one very interesting
example in American history

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.460
is that we used to have
heavily regulated airlines.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.163
And the federal government justified this,

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:17.270
on the grounds that it was
interstate commerce, right?

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.567
Planes fly across state lines.

00:37:19.567 --> 00:37:23.350
But there was a lot of
suspicion that these regulations

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.460
were mostly serving the
interests of the airlines.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.410
And then a number of academics
had the brilliant idea

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.280
they found what we might
call a natural experiment,

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.300
which was that there are two states

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.290
that are sufficiently
large, Texas and California,

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.344
that they have big,

00:37:45.344 --> 00:37:46.177
big

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.270
airline routes that
don't cross state lines,

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.330
and so therefore,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.670
were exempt from the FAA's regulation.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.690
And they did a bunch of empirical studies

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.960
which showed that the
the airline's operating

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.703
only within Texas and California,

00:38:09.234 --> 00:38:12.490
were way cheaper and way more efficient

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.940
than the regulated ones.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.150
And so it was a kind of
lay down hand demonstration

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:23.000
that we shouldn't be
regulated these industries

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.210
at least in the way we were

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.880
and whatever benefits they were serving,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.970
they were not serving the
interests of the consumer.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.070
And these studies provided
a considerable amount

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.970
of the ballast in arguing
for airline deregulation

00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:41.300
and turning airplanes into
instead of play things

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.333
for the wealthy sort of buses with wings,

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.253
which is what we have today.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.200
Other areas where technocratic
regulation gives you

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.119
the right answer is

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:57.997
where there are unambiguous
market failures.

00:38:57.997 --> 00:39:02.483
For example, insurance markets,

00:39:04.332 --> 00:39:05.920
if you do not require

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.189
people to have collision insurance,

00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:12.250
the problem is that
the people who would go

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:15.240
and want to go and buy collision insurance

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.270
are the risky drivers with no assets.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.860
And they're the people
that insurance companies

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.403
would not want to insure.

00:39:23.405 --> 00:39:24.260
So if,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.500
you know if you're very safe driver,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.500
and you can self-insure you
wouldn't want to do that.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.390
And so if it weren't mandatory

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.863
for people to buy auto insurance,

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.220
insurance markets would
end up pricing it's so high

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.720
that most people wouldn't buy it,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.290
then the markets would unravel.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.870
So this is the this is the idea

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:52.140
what sometimes called adverse
selection by economist

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.710
you got adverse selection means

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.450
that the people the companies
don't want to insure

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.340
are the ones who want the insurance

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.210
and the people that they would
wanna insure don't want it

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.800
and they certainly not
going to buy it at the price

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.590
that the companies are going to charge.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.980
Similar arguments get made
about health insurance

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.610
that only sick people would go

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.227
and buy a share of insurance voluntarily.

00:40:17.227 --> 00:40:20.350
And so that would price the market

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:23.370
would price it out of
the reach of most people.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.150
So these are the sorts of areas

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.500
where you have unambiguous market failures

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.650
because of adverse selection.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.650
And as a result, this case
technocratic case for regulation.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.200
Another is deposit as insurance in banks.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.853
So if you think about how
banks make their money,

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.430
people in an era when banks paid interest,

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.652
of course,

00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:52.210
people would deposit
their money in the bank

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.520
and get paid a certain interest rate.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.750
The bank would then lend out the money

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.480
to people who were investing things

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.313
and the bank would make its
money on this spread, right?

00:41:03.313 --> 00:41:06.930
That's, I'm not talking
about a badly managed bank,

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.970
I'm totally completely
well functioning bank.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.140
That's what banks do.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.280
That's what they're there for, right?

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.360
But of course, it all assumes

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.640
that not everybody is going to come along

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.520
and take out their money at once.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.800
Because they don't have the money.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.580
They've lent the money, right.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.580
So, that is what but what a
well functioning bank does.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.000
Now if you have a panic,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.020
and this is what happened
during the Depression,

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.213
if you have a panic,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.170
and people start to believe

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:37.210
that the bank is gonna go bankrupt,

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.890
then everybody's gonna go

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.310
and take that money out of the bank

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.740
because they don't want to
lose their money, right.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.600
And so you're gonna get a
run on the banks, right.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.035
And this is part of among the things

00:41:48.035 --> 00:41:50.450
that happened during the Depression.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.920
And indeed, part of that we think

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.130
of Glass Steagall for other reasons,

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.040
but the financial reforms
of 1933 one of the things

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.190
they did was create deposit
as insurance, right?

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.193
Because then if everybody's told no,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.450
if the bank goes bankrupt,

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.600
you're gonna be covered

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.600
up to it was until the
financial crisis up to $100,000.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.390
Then people, they know the
government's gonna protect them

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.740
and they'll leave their money in the bank

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.130
and you won't get the bank run.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.080
Again, so this is there's a clear

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.060
technocratic case here
for regulation, right.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.740
These are not hard calls,
One might say that.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.040
Though I would add that notice sometimes

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.600
the technocratic solution
creates new problems.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.111
So if the government is
insuring the depositors,

00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:49.290
then it means the banks can gamble

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.590
with other people's money

00:42:54.343 --> 00:42:57.220
because the bank knows the
government's gonna bail out

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.390
their depositors.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.520
They're not gonna go bankrupt,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.740
so they can be more risk-embracing

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.160
than they might otherwise be.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.360
And so you might think that
they have to regulate them.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.320
The way in fact that was handled
when they created the FDIC

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.550
was they made the banks
finance the bailout funds.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:22.550
So the banks had to essentially,
pay a tax that funded

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.940
the insurance of depositors

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.270
so that the banks are
internalizing the risk,

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.053
if you like, of providing it.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.080
Though, as it turned out,
during the financial crisis,

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.747
it rapidly became obvious that 100,000

00:43:39.747 --> 00:43:43.670
wasn't gonna be enough
to stop runs on banks.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.140
And so the government in
the middle of the crisis

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.842
just increased it to 250,000.

00:43:48.842 --> 00:43:52.280
Which, among other things made it obvious

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.030
that if push comes to shove,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.040
actually the taxpayers
are ensuring the deposit

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.390
so doesn't solve, if you like,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.930
the moral hazard that the
banks have to be risky,

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:05.380
if they now know that

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.880
even if the deposit
insurance is insufficient,

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.190
Uncle Sam will come to the rescue.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.910
So when we think about even
if it's a non ambiguous case

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:20.670
for regulation, doesn't
mean that there's a solution

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:24.133
that's not gonna generate
tricky problems of its own.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.287
There are also hard cases.

00:44:27.287 --> 00:44:32.050
So if you imagine yourself to be a senator

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.890
or a congressman or congress
woman sitting in a hearing

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:40.513
and in walks Paul Volcker,

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.470
former Fed chair, extremely
distinguished economist

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:48.340
and says,

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:53.070
we've gotta separate commercial
from investment banks.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.870
We cannot have investment
banks, investing their own money

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.240
while also being fiduciary
for people who deposit funds

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.320
this had been what had been
done in Glass Steagall,

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.130
and had had been undone in the run up

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.370
to the financial crisis.

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:14.740
And Volcker was firmly of the
view that some version of this

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.830
needed to be reinstituted
so that the investment banks

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.874
would not end up having
the sort of incentives

00:45:21.874 --> 00:45:25.110
that for example, Goldman,
turned out to have

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.470
during the housing crisis,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.310
which I will talk about on Thursday,

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.080
when they unloaded
mortgages that they knew

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.760
were going south on their own clients,

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.970
conflict of interest between
the fiduciary obligation

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.450
to their clients and
their attempt to protect

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:45.830
their balance sheets as investors.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.690
So you have Volcker coming in saying

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.280
this has gotta be stopped.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.410
And then you have Tim Geithner, you know,

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.470
the genius from the administration

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:58.870
who saved the world economy
coming in and saying,

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.060
this is a terrible idea.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.513
We should not do this,

00:46:02.582 --> 00:46:06.617
it interrupts the way
in which markets work

00:46:06.617 --> 00:46:11.617
because investment banks often
have to do market making,

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.940
they have to facilitate transactions,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.350
which sometimes means
buying and holding assets

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.160
from somebody who wants to sell them

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.740
until you can find a buyer.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.760
And he'll give a long
speech about why in fact,

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.590
we shouldn't have what subsidy

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.550
came to be known as the Volcker Rule.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.170
And you had the senators sitting there

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.982
or the congressman or the congresswoman.

00:46:31.982 --> 00:46:35.180
Do you think these politicians

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.340
have the slightest idea who's right?

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.960
(Audience laughing)

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.453
They'd have absolutely no
idea who's right, right?

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.100
You know, and you could line up

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.200
distinguished economists on
both sides of this question,

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.150
and the politicians are going
to have to decide what to do.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.900
But in fact, these technocratic hard calls

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.900
that often elude the people who
are actually making the law.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.920
And then there's In addition,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.500
even if you have a good
technocratic regulation,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.870
will the government
actually have the capacity

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:13.500
to implement it?

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.560
Again, if you think when back to as I said

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.700
in 2004, and 2005,

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.420
when the big banks persuaded
the federal government

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.960
to ease up on their capital requirements,

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.030
they said in return, we'll
open our books to you.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.140
But in fact, Christopher Cox had I think

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:36.140
it was four or five
regulators or maybe six,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.056
whose job was to watch more
than $4 trillion in assets,

00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:43.970
and they simply didn't
have the capacity to do it.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.530
So,

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.563
while it is true,

00:47:47.563 --> 00:47:50.780
that there is sometimes clear cases

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.030
for regulation on technical grounds,

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.370
we shouldn't think you can
ring the politics out of it

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:01.190
or that the process of implementing it

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.110
doesn't create issues that subsequently

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.220
will come home to roost in difficult ways.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.610
But I think if you wanted the poster child

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:14.970
for a technocratic regulator,
it would be Tim Geithner.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:17.930
And just to give a give a sense of this,

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:21.030
here he is five years
after the fact ruminating

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.210
on the actions that he took.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.878
- I think a lot of people still feel

00:48:26.878 --> 00:48:31.480
that the banks should have
been made to pay in some way,

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.313
- Yeah

00:48:32.313 --> 00:48:34.110
- Either in terms of restructuring,

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.783
less executive compensation.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.220
Some cases, some people
shoulda gone to jail.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.210
- I think everybody feels that way.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.483
- Do you feel that way?

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.210
- Well,

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.330
I feel like it's a complicated thing.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.740
You know, there was a
terrible amount of abuse,

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.220
and fraud and bad behavior,

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.600
and damaging and dumb things
that people did in this crisis.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.560
And I think Americans definitely deserved

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.781
a stronger enforcement
response, and its completely...

00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:02.003
- I wanna know what you think, I mean...

00:49:02.003 --> 00:49:02.840
- and I think

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.320
- You saw this up close
better than anybody.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.370
Does it surprise you nobody went to jail?

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.900
- It doesn't surprise me
no one's going to jail.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.053
It doesn't surprise me.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.710
- [Narrator] What may have
been immoral or unethical,

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.110
he says, was not illegal.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.530
Geithner would become a lightning rod

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.990
and TARP, the $700 billion rescue package

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.660
he helped push through to save the banks

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.940
would take much of the heat.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.004
Banks have paid back
the loans with interest,

00:49:33.004 --> 00:49:35.280
but the cheap money they were lent

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.280
allowed them to reap billions in profits

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.913
as homeowners struggled.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.400
- These banks were
still taking huge bonus.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.233
- That was terrible.

00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:45.066
That was terrible.

00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:47.330
It was outrageous and killed us.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.470
- [Narrator] But Geithner
argues that even though

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.203
it appeared the arsonists
were being rewarded,

00:49:52.203 --> 00:49:55.460
the banking system had to be secured.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.090
- In a financial panic, there
is enormous collateral damage.

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.500
They're deeply unfair and
tragic in that context.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.120
So the first imperative is to make sure

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.180
you make the system stable

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.090
not because you care about the banks,

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.750
or you wanna protect
them from their mistakes,

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.071
but because if you let the lights go out,

00:50:11.071 --> 00:50:13.540
the system will collapse around them.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.810
- Do you worry about
defending your legacy?

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:20.810
- I feel, I feel very
confident that we made

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:24.280
some very good choices and
the best choices we could

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.363
in the circumstances of the time.

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:32.920
- So there you have that
it's not that he thinks

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.320
these people were good

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.380
or that they didn't do terrible things.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.720
But that's not his job.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.920
His job was to save the system,

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.623
and this was the way to do it.

00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:47.030
So the short of it is
that technocratic theories

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.509
of regulations ignore the
ways in which power, politics

00:50:50.509 --> 00:50:53.610
and ideology shape outcomes.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:58.100
So a second perspective on regulation

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:03.100
goes back to Chicago economist
by the name of George Stigler

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:06.410
not to be confused with Stiglitz,

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:11.410
who is a famous economist writing today

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.688
and Stigler

00:51:14.688 --> 00:51:17.180
pays attention

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.823
in his work and this is hugely influential

00:51:21.823 --> 00:51:25.910
to the distribution of
power in the economy.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:29.040
And he says, well, what is a regulation?

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.890
A regulation is actually a valuable thing.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.300
And so it's gonna have a price.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.990
He thinks like an economist.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:40.990
And what a regulation is, is
basically the capacity to use

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.360
the government's monopoly
on power to get something

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.790
and powerful groups are gonna use it

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.300
if the government is available.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.070
So even though he's a Chicago economist,

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.580
generally thought to
be heavily pro market.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.170
Basically, what is his theory
of like regulation is that

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.530
big firms, producer interests

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.990
are gonna dominate

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.903
what regulations get made.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.470
Big firms that going
to, to use terminology

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.160
we've used earlier in the course,

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.130
the big firms in an
industry have a K group.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:21.430
They can coordinate in
order to get the regulations

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.660
that they want adopted by politicians.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:26.820
They can coordinate,
they can lobby for them,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.693
they can spend money to get them.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.840
And that's what they will do.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.690
Whereas for small firms and consumers,

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:37.130
it's very hard for them to organize,

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.930
and it's gonna be unlikely

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.730
that they're going to get their way.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.690
So, as a as a causal matter,
we should expect the big firms

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:50.682
to dominate the regulatory process.

00:52:50.682 --> 00:52:53.670
In Stigler's mind this is a reason

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:56.828
for avoiding regulation altogether.

00:52:56.828 --> 00:52:58.470
Which is something

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.350
one inference one could draw from it.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:07.350
But, there are others, which
we'll get to in a minute.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.000
So if you want examples of this,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.080
it would be airline day regulation

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.865
in the first place, right?

00:53:13.865 --> 00:53:17.770
It served the big airlines
to get these regulations

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:19.690
to protect their markets,

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.513
and so they regulated to get them.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.870
Taxi medallions in New York City.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:31.870
Before the advent of Uber,

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.240
a New York City taxi medallion

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.480
was worth a million dollars.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.460
Today, it's not even
worth $100,000, right.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.293
Again,

00:53:42.168 --> 00:53:45.173
until the changes in the market eroded,

00:53:47.196 --> 00:53:48.190
eroded the monopoly

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:51.623
is just that the taxi
medallions had created,

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.990
they functioned as huge barriers to entry.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:58.076
And indeed in many European countries

00:53:58.076 --> 00:54:02.680
still big fights that they
in Madrid for example,

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.933
Uber is outlawed.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.823
Again you have a taxi monopoly protecting,

00:54:09.823 --> 00:54:12.473
protecting itself.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.593
Also in the I mentioned to you earlier

00:54:17.593 --> 00:54:21.620
that the erosion of Glass Steagall.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.510
So Glass Steagall was passed in 1933.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.160
If you read Ron Chernow
is the house of Morgan,

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.260
one of his many brilliant books.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.690
You among themes that
Chernow recounts in that book

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:40.210
is the relentless efforts
to get rid of Glass Steagall

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.840
almost from the moment
that it was enacted.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:46.930
And the truth be told when it
was finally repealed in 1999.

00:54:48.203 --> 00:54:50.160
At the end of the Clinton administration,

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.440
there was virtually nothing left of it.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.502
So again,

00:54:53.502 --> 00:54:58.502
the big financial institutions
had used their lobbying power

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:03.810
to get regulations that
serve their own interests.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.160
So very different than the
technocratic theory of regulation

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.960
here's, the argument is
the big players shape

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.579
the regulatory landscape,

00:55:13.579 --> 00:55:17.220
and if you wanna know how
it's going to play out,

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.710
look at what their interests are

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.613
because they are the ones
who are going to prevail.

00:55:23.242 --> 00:55:26.390
A third perspective on regulations,

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.200
takes off from the observation,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:33.200
well politicians need money,
but they also need votes.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:38.032
And so they're gonna have to trade off,

00:55:38.032 --> 00:55:43.032
trade off attending to lobbyists
and attending to voters,

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:47.250
the two most important pieces
here by Samuel Peltzman,

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.500
from the 1970s,

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.575
and a more recent one
prompted by Dodd Frank

00:55:52.575 --> 00:55:57.490
by a Columbia economist,
by the name of John Coffee

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:00.350
and so,

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:02.540
so the idea here is that politicians

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.920
can't completely ignore voters.

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.980
But so when will they attend to voters

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.610
because the thing about voters sentiment

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:16.073
is that it's sometimes intense,
but it's very intermittent.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.400
Voters get outraged by something

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.020
and focus on it for a short time.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.810
But then things change,

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.700
there's something else in the headlines,

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.073
and it moves on.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:31.700
So Coffee call it called it

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.810
a kind of sine curve of regulation.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:38.810
So when voter anger is
that a high fever pitch,

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.500
you might be able to, or
concern is that a fever pitch,

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.230
you might be able to enact a regulation

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:49.500
that you will not be able to
enact at a different time.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.670
And most of the time,

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.300
consumer interests are latent,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.263
but they'll become manifest.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.430
But of course, if the producer groups,

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:00.840
the big players,

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.470
the Stigler people know that,

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.380
their motto just needs to be

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.640
all we have to do is wait, right?

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.740
And so the examples that
that immediately come to mind

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.730
are gun control legislation.

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.780
Every time there's a school shooting,

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.730
this is whipped up,

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.663
rage by voters,

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.700
that something has to be done

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.110
something has to be done
and politicians all say

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.620
something has to be done.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:34.620
But the NRA keeps its head
down and a few weeks later,

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.220
the news cycle has moved on,

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:41.586
and you come down the same curve

00:57:41.586 --> 00:57:46.300
and you don't need to pay
attention to voter interest.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.940
Support for disaster relief.

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.580
It's the same kinda thing.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.970
In the midst of a disaster,

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:54.993
there'll be huge pressure to support,

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.750
spending money for disaster relief,

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:02.860
but once the disaster or the
headlines about the disaster

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.060
are over the support dissipates.

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.500
This is why Amartya Sen makes the point

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.680
that you don't get famines in democracies.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.210
That's true.

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.940
But you do get chronic poverty, right,

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:19.570
because crises generate
voter interest and attention,

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.423
whereas chronic problems tend not to.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:27.920
So this is the voter orientated model

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.060
that's gonna tell you
politics and ideology

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.963
gonna matter some of the time.

00:58:35.273 --> 00:58:38.252
And, but much of the time,

00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:41.250
you're gonna in fact, have
the big producer groups

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.650
get what they want,
regardless of the politics

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:48.700
and regardless of the technocratic merits.

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.450
So if you think about Dodd Frank,

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:55.270
it was a major overhaul of
banking regulation in the US

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.830
of capital requirements,
how much capital banks

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.290
have to hold, and of the
government's resolution authority,

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:08.290
what power the government
has to unwind troubled banks.

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.000
A few things to say about, first of all,

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.210
it was enacted in the
spring and summer of 2010,

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.500
before the midterms,

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.370
and that meant actually they enacted it

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:23.330
even before the commission
that they had appointed

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.960
to analyze what had gone wrong

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.010
in the financial crisis had reported.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:31.223
And the reason they did that was that,

00:59:33.969 --> 00:59:34.969
unlike 1934,

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.655
the vast majority of the time,

00:59:37.655 --> 00:59:40.500
the party in the White House loses seats

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.070
in the midterm elections.

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.620
They didn't know they would
actually lose control,

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.920
but they knew they were gonna have

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.100
they're gonna be less well placed

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.150
to pass legislation
after the 2010 midterms.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.580
So the whole thing had to be concentrated

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.810
into a very short period of time.

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.813
This was not a bill Republicans
were going to support,

01:00:00.813 --> 01:00:02.790
and they knew it.

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:03.840
The White House knew it.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.590
And so they essentially had to do what

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:11.540
to write this bill in
over the course of 2010,

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.530
and get it enacted in
the summer of that year,

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.363
which is what they did.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.990
It was subject to intense lobbying before,

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.040
during and after passage.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.560
But it illustrates all three of the models

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.850
that I've been talking about.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.170
And you can see how the different ones

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:34.340
give you an insight
into different aspects.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.340
So one of the nice things about
this book by Alan Blinder,

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.510
who had been on the Federal Reserve

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.460
as an economist at Princeton,

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:48.070
is that he has a four-page
table in this book

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.840
After the Music Stopped,

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.470
which summarizes the whole Bill and just,

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.993
I'm not gonna go through all of it,

01:00:54.993 --> 01:00:58.690
but on the left column is the issue

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.300
and then the key aspects
of what the debate were,

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.440
then the Treasury proposal,

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.840
and then what was finally enacted.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.220
And the point is that that
Treasury proposal very much

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.890
reflected the interests
of the of the industry

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.893
because the industry has lobbied
the Treasury very heavily.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.380
And the takeaway from the chart,

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.820
I'll post all four pages
of it for you to look at

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.560
is that on virtually
everything of importance,

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.720
the Treasury got what it wanted,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.720
essentially what the Treasury
had negotiated with the banks

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:37.670
was what wound up in the law

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:41.180
on the too big to fail, on systemic risk,

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.250
on various other things.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.260
And as I said,

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.273
I will post these so that
people can look through them.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.220
But on virtually all particulars,

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.080
the Treasury got what it wanted signaling

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.260
the Stiglarian theory looked pretty good.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:05.260
When President Obama signed it in July,

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.030
the industry was unhappy
with some pieces of it.

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:15.340
They had essentially
lobbied to stop the bill

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.940
for as long as they could,

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.250
and then to weaken it once they saw

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.150
a bill was definitely going to pass.

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:23.360
And Scott Talbot,

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.300
the chief lobbyist for the
financial services Roundtable,

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.500
the day the bill was signed,

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.750
he said, this is halftime.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.583
And,

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:34.650
so where did they fail?

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.550
Where did the industry
not get what it wanted?

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:39.607
So one issue was the

01:02:39.607 --> 01:02:42.935
issue of proprietary trading,

01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:46.520
I've already talked about
the so called Volcker Rule.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.476
And what was interesting
about how they wound up

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:52.120
with the Volcker rule was the following.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.290
They had lobbied to kill
it and they had killed it.

01:02:55.290 --> 01:03:00.290
And you might remember that in 2008, Nine,

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:04.400
Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts died.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.760
And this was at a time

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.711
when there was increasing
anger in the in the grassroots

01:03:11.711 --> 01:03:14.760
of the Democratic party
with the degree to which

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.640
the Obama administration

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.930
was being solicitous of the banks

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:25.570
and had let the AIG
bailouts go, and so on.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:30.421
And so there was a special
election in Massachusetts.

01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:34.813
The most liberal state in
the Union often said to be.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.520
Was it Ronald Reagan, who called it

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.530
the People's Republic of Massachusetts

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.780
it was some conservative
politician called it

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.850
the People's Republic of Massachusetts.

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:47.460
Anyway, shock.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.380
The Democrats was so dispirited,

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.373
there was very low
turnout and a Republican,

01:03:53.693 --> 01:03:56.063
a Republican, a truck driver,

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.270
since come and gone,

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.410
actually won the senate seat

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:08.290
and Obama was, so the pop book say

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.290
was sufficiently spooked by this,

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:13.180
that they decided they had to do something

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.420
for the base of the Democratic Party.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.570
And they put the Volcker Rule back in

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:23.150
essentially outlawing proprietary trading.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:26.860
And so that's how it wound up in the bill.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.880
The other area where the
industry didn't prevail

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.030
was in the consumer protection area.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:39.630
There, the feeling was sufficiently strong

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:40.500
in the White House

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:44.003
that predatory lending had to be stopped.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:50.071
This was Elizabeth Warren
who was by the way it was

01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:55.071
in the White House in 2009 and 10.

01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:58.490
And this was the central
thing she had been pushing

01:04:59.849 --> 01:05:02.130
and was non negotiable,
there was gonna have to be

01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:04.410
consumer financial protection.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.720
The industry hated it.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.400
They lobbied and lobbied
and lobbied to stop it.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.230
And when they couldn't stop it,

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:11.523
they essentially,

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.610
they worked with the folks

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:19.280
from the Treasury to create
an administrative structure

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.870
that was almost completely unworkable.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.290
Alan Blinder in his book,

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:26.800
and he certainly no flaming radical

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.720
describes it as a Rube Goldberg machine.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.130
And it was not given cabinet status.

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.060
It was contained within the Treasury,

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.760
it reported to Congress.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.480
The first few years of
its operation produced

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.950
huge turnover personnel because
they were so demoralized.

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:48.130
So there you see,

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:51.160
you see the interplay between the Stigler

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.100
and the Peltzman Coffee views.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.600
In fact, the lobbying

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.743
the lobbying was to just incredible.

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:05.513
And one of the interesting things is

01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:07.660
more than a billion was spent.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.493
But,

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.820
one of the interesting things is,

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.270
you can see on this chart here is that

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:20.090
much of the lobbying will
occurred after the bill passed.

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:23.900
So the bill passes here, right,

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.840
and you can see the financial
lobbying of the fed,

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.190
the Treasury and other
regulatory organizations

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.220
actually increases.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.420
Here's a New York Times
breakdown of money spent

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:43.203
lobbying after, after the
passage of the legislation.

01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:45.783
You might think, Well, why?

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:50.890
Isn't a game over once the
legislation have been passed,

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:52.930
and actually not,

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:57.930
for example, on the Dodd Frank law.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:00.320
I happen to be friends with somebody

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.890
who at that time was a partner at Goldman.

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.370
And the day the bill
passed, I said to him,

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:08.930
so does this mean Goldman

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:12.770
is out of the proprietary
trading business for good?

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.210
He said, it'll be five years
before it's clear whether

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.053
we managed to kill that or not.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:23.063
And so what you look at is,

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:27.900
when Congress passes a law,
that's just the beginning,

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.260
then they have to, the
regulators have to write rules.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.270
And this is where a lot of
the lobbying actually occurs,

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:39.570
partly because of the
Coffee curve of regulation.

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.170
Voters are on to the next thing now.

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:44.513
Nobody's thinking about Dodd Frank.

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:48.777
Nobody's thinking about the Volcker Rule.

01:07:48.777 --> 01:07:53.610
And so you have, they publish
a potential regulation,

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.590
you have a comment period, they got 8000.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:08:00.920
the vast majority, long detailed
comments from the industry.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.308
Financial lobbying groups met
with regulators 400 times,

01:08:05.308 --> 01:08:10.308
78% almost 80% of all
the meetings they had.

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:15.630
They had to keep pushing back the rule

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:18.130
because they couldn't get it written.

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:22.180
And so the second time they
had another comment period,

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.880
they got 17,000 comments, again,

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.163
the vast majority,

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:33.590
the vast majority of
them from the industry,

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:35.970
proposing amendments
that would essentially

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:38.497
make the rule unadministrable,

01:08:38.497 --> 01:08:41.820
particularly would make
it virtually impossible

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:45.220
for a regulator to tell the difference

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.540
between genuine market making where a bank

01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:52.390
buys and holds some assets
that a client wants to sell

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:56.060
in order to find another buyer,
from when they buying them

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.350
for their own purposes
and on their own account.

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.230
And it was finally, is partly repealed

01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:07.870
for smaller institutions in
the Trump reforms of 2018.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.720
And just to come full circle
on the Stiglarian theory.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.030
Once Trump came into office,

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:21.810
the Republicans had been
campaigning for years

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:24.563
on repeal Dodd Frank, repeal Dodd Frank.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.060
This is terrible thing that
Obama administration has put in,

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.570
but you would start to see articles

01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:32.750
like this one in the Wall Street Journal.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.590
Guess who's defending
Dodd Frank, they said.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:40.590
This is December 2016, a
month after Trump's election.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:42.440
There, the Wall Street Journal

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.125
Op Ed page says there goes
another liberal fantasy

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.810
and progressive law.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:51.280
Giant banks hate Dodd Frank
and would like nothing more

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.430
than to return it to a
regulatory Wild West.

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:56.040
So why is it been so hard

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.260
since the Republican election sweep

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.040
to find a Wall Street CEO

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.660
Who favors repealing Dodd Frank.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.600
JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon,
Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.005
have urged against repeal
and other banks CEOs

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.410
are suggesting policy small ball

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:14.350
rather than wholesale reform.

01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:18.970
Blankfein who will have former colleagues

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:21.434
as senior policymakers in
the Trump administration,

01:10:21.434 --> 01:10:24.020
in particular is in a position

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.260
to encourage significant change.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.730
But last year he, this is Blankfein,

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.373
explain why that's not
in Goldman's interest.

01:10:31.373 --> 01:10:34.318
After describing how
regulatory costs have helped

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:37.530
raise the barriers to
entry in his business

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:39.876
higher than at any time in modern history,

01:10:39.876 --> 01:10:43.480
Blankfein forecast more opportunities

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.600
for global giants like Goldman,

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.940
to gain market share as
only a handful of players

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.970
will likely to be effective,

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:54.540
will be able to effectively
to compete on a global basis.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.201
So this is the Stigler theory,

01:10:57.201 --> 01:11:01.660
up in lights that the
Dodd Frank has now become

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:05.160
a massive barrier to
entry for smaller firms.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.160
Likewise, the much hated
much despise much criticized

01:11:10.207 --> 01:11:13.970
Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau last week

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.020
the journal weighed on the presidents

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.675
of four trade associations
representing banks

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:23.675
and credit unions also
urged deregulatory restraint

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.470
and pushed for very minor reforms.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.393
So when we think about
the missed opportunities,

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.270
what could have been done
differently to some extent,

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.503
and you get this from the popular books?

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:42.260
The Obama administration came in there

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.460
and was sort of drinking
out of a fire hydrant,

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.092
things were happening so fast,

01:11:46.092 --> 01:11:49.390
they really had very little choice.

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.850
To some extent they were
a victim of weak parties.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.710
This is something I'm going
to talk much more about

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.080
in the remaining lectures of the course

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.470
but one difference if you
think back to the 1930s,

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:04.570
The parties were much stronger.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.403
And in 32

01:12:08.953 --> 01:12:10.400
and 34,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.260
the Democrats were in a
very different position

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.250
to enact FDR's reforms

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.550
than was the case

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:22.650
in the response to the financial
crisis where I told you,

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:24.480
the Bush administration had to work

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.160
with congressional Democrats
to get TARP enacted.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.950
And the Obama administration
knew that it had

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.849
tiny window of opportunity.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:37.450
And it was it was not gonna
be able to do very much

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:39.700
and by the way, the Trump administration

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.870
ran into the same thing
when they sought to repeal

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:47.850
much of Dodd Frank, they
ran into massive resistance

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:51.270
to repeal in the senate
perhaps from senators

01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:54.456
who were being supported
by some of the people

01:12:54.456 --> 01:12:56.570
that were being talked about

01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:59.374
in the Wall Street Journal op-ed piece

01:12:59.374 --> 01:13:01.020
I was talking about.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:06.020
But I wanna end by just talking
about elite complacency.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:09.360
I showed you this picture

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.350
at the beginning of today's lecture

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:13.870
of the collapse of the stock market

01:13:17.795 --> 01:13:22.333
and the vanishing of 16.4
trillion of net worth.

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:27.360
But what I didn't say is if you look,

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.820
what was the case two years later,

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.610
two years later and more
than half of the wealth

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.100
had already come back.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.310
And if you look at the financial sector,

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:39.360
if you look at the stock markets,

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.210
This is France, Germany, Japan,

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:44.430
UK and the US in light blue,

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:49.430
you can see that a decade
after the collapse,

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.570
the stock markets had all come back

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.770
and indeed we I believe
we had a record high

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:55.203
on the Dow yesterday.

01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:59.050
So from the point of view of the of people

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:01.170
in the financial services industry

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:02.789
or upper middle class people,

01:14:02.789 --> 01:14:06.093
their 401k said come back.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.440
For them this crisis was long
over for many such people.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:17.350
And I think what that ignored

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:19.660
was the increasing divergence

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.090
between that recovery for people

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.830
in the financial services sector

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:26.254
with significant retirement assets

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:29.900
and other assets in stock markets,

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.900
and the real economy that
was playing itself out

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.570
in Middle America and over much of Europe,

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:41.160
where you can see that the jobs deficit

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.160
was much deeper after this
crisis and lasted a lot longer.

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:49.770
You can see that long
term unemployment that is

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:54.234
people who are unemployed for
more than 27 continuous weeks

01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:57.540
was at higher levels and today,

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.700
to this day, remains at high levels

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.703
than for more than half a century.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.490
And housing,

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.799
more than 10 million houses
would be foreclosed upon

01:15:10.799 --> 01:15:13.650
in the decade following
the housing market,

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:17.110
which is the subject I'm
gonna talk about next.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:21.890
But this, this divergence
between the fortunes of people

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:26.340
living off the financial economy

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.323
and the rest of America and by the way

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.240
it's not only America.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.250
This is the Algo-America
welcoming refugees

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:38.040
into Germany also greatly underestimating

01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:40.621
the angst out there

01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:43.992
outside of the political
and economic elites,

01:15:43.992 --> 01:15:48.992
and that angst is what
would be coming back to bite

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.530
in 2016.

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:55.363
Okay, we will talk about the
housing crisis on Thursday.

01:15:58.518 --> 01:16:00.935
(soft music)

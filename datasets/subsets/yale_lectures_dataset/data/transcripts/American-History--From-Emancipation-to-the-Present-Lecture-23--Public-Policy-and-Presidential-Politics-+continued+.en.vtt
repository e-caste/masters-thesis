00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.267
"Fellow citizens, pardon me,

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:20.400
and allow me to ask, why am
I called upon to speak here

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.567
today? What have I or those
I represent to do with your

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.400
national independence?
Are the great principles of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.467
political freedom and
of natural justice,

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.200
embodied in that
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.467
extended to us?
And am I, therefore,

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.667
called upon to bring our
humble offering to the

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.300
national altar, and to
confess the benefits,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.100
and express devout gratitude
for the blessings resulting

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.100
from your independence
to us?&nbsp; Would to God,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.600
both for your
sakes and ours,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
that an affirmative answer
could be truthfully returned

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.000
to these questions. But
such is not the state of the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.367
case. I say it with a
sad sense of the disparity

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.767
between us. I am not
included within the pale of

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:07.367
this glorious anniversary!
Your high independence only

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:11.100
reveals the immeasurable
distance between us. The

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.667
blessings in which you this
day rejoice are not enjoyed

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.467
in common. The rich
inheritance of justice,

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.767
liberty, prosperity, and
independence bequeathed by

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.267
your fathers is
shared by you,

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.400
not by me. The sunlight that
brought life and healing to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.867
you has brought stripes and
death to me. This Fourth of

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:39.067
July is yours, not
mine. You may rejoice,

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.600
I must mourn. To drag a man
in fetters into the grand

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.000
illuminated
temple of liberty,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900
and call upon him to
join you in joyous anthems,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.767
were inhuman mockery and
sacrilegious irony. Do you

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:57.867
mean, citizens, to mock me,
by asking me to speak today?

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:01.000
What to the American slave
is your Fourth of July? I

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
answer, a day that reveals
to him more than all other

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.300
days of the year, the gross
injustice and cruelty to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.800
which he is the
constant victim. To him your

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.900
celebration is a sham; your
boasted liberty an unholy

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.700
license; your
national greatness,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.200
swelling vanity; your sounds
of rejoicing are empty and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500
heartless; your
denunciations of tyrants,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.200
brass-fronted impudence;
your shouts of liberty and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.667
equality, hollow mockery;
your prayers and hymns,

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.067
your sermons and
thanksgivings,

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.400
with all your religious
parade and solemnity,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.467
are to him mere
bombast, fraud,

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:40.500
deception,
impiety, and hypocrisy,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.300
a thin veil to cover up
crimes which would disgrace

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.700
a nation of savages. There
is not a nation of the earth

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.400
guilty of practices more
shocking and bloody than are

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.000
the people of these United
States at this very hour.&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.700
Go where you may,
search where you will,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.800
roam through all the
monarchies and despotisms of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.100
the Old World, travel
through South America,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.700
search out every abuse
and when you have found the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.800
last, lay your facts by
the side of the everyday

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.800
practices of this nation,
and you will say with me

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.267
that, for revolting
barbarity and shameless

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:20.667
hypocrisy, America reigns
without a rival." Welcome to

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:31.100
class.&nbsp; Many of you will have recognized Frederick

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700
Douglass's speech,
delivered in Rochester,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.967
New York to abolitionist
friends on July 5th,

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:44.767
1852.&nbsp; Douglass is invited
by his friends to come to

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:49.500
Rochester on July 4th to
talk about the meaning of

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.300
freedom, the
meaning of liberty,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.700
the meaning of this great
country.&nbsp; These were his

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.500
friends.&nbsp; He refused to come
on July 4th for the reasons

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.267
that you certainly heard in
this excerpt--and this is a

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:05.700
three hour long speech, I
spared you two hours and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.200
fifty-eight minutes of.&nbsp;
It's a brilliant speech.&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.000
But he refused to
come on July 4th,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.200
because to talk about
independence and liberty to

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.200
a person who emancipated
himself was unkind at best,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.100
certainly blind.&nbsp; But he did
come.&nbsp; He came on July 5th,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.600
the next day, and offered
and presented one of the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.700
great speeches in American
letters.&nbsp; Now this course is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.700
about the African
American experience after

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.267
emancipation, from
emancipation to the

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:47.100
present.&nbsp; Today, however,
I'm going to lay the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.667
foundation for the course by
discussing events prior to

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.100
the emancipatory moment.&nbsp;
Now before doing that,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100
telling you
some more stories,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.100
I want to attend to some
course details.&nbsp; One of the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.100
first things some of you may
have noticed. You can come

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.100
on down if you want to.&nbsp; One
of the first things you may

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.100
have noticed is that there
are some people back there,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100
and there's a camera, and
I'm mic'ed.&nbsp; This course is

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100
being filmed for the Open
Yale Course Initiative,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.100
funded by the
Hewlett-Packard foundation,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.100
one of six courses being
filmed this semester.&nbsp; You

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.100
are not on camera, unless
you kind of walk right in

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.100
front of me right
during lecture,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.100
which I kind of hope you
won't do.&nbsp; You won't be on

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.100
camera, so don't worry about
it--and don't try to join me

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.100
on camera, you know, because
I got it just at the right

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.100
angle, you know, and I don't
want them filming my bad

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.100
side.&nbsp; Anyway, you just need
to know that the camera's

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.100
there, and really, it
shouldn't be a factor in the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.100
course at all.&nbsp; They promise
to be unobtrusive.&nbsp; Now,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100
I'm not the only one
teaching this course.&nbsp; I'm

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.100
leading it, certainly, but
I'm not the only one that's

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.100
going to help you understand
this experience.&nbsp; Joining me

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100
in this task are
seven different teaching

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100
assistants, a really quite
excellent crew that I'm

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100
excited about. I want to
introduce them to you rather

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100
quickly: Ruthie Yow is the
head TA. She is getting her

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.100
Ph. D. in African American
Studies and American

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.100
Studies, working
on ethnography,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.100
cultural history and school
desegregation in the South.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.100
Jane Ptolemy, there's
Jane, is in African American

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.100
Studies and History
as well--excuse me,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.100
History, studying race,
benevolence and religion in

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.100
the early national
period.&nbsp; Chris Johnson,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.100
African American
Studies and History,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.100
studying gender, migration
and migrant politics and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.100
radicalism in black
diasporas.&nbsp; Ruthie,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
Jane and Chris are leading
writing intensive sections,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.100
and I'll explain more about
that in a few moments.&nbsp; So

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.100
those three are leading the
writing intensive sections.&nbsp;

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.100
Brian Distelberg in History,
is studying twentieth

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.100
century US
culture and politics,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.100
specifically anti-defamation
activism by historically

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.100
marginalized
groups.&nbsp; Anastasia Jones,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.100
down there as
well, is in History,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.100
studying gender
and sexuality,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.100
mid-twentieth century
US culture.&nbsp; Lauren

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.100
Pearlman--that's like the
TA corner.&nbsp; That's really

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.100
cute--is in African American
Studies and American

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100
Studies, studying social,
cultural and political

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.100
geography of
Washington, D.C.,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.100
with a focus on local civil
rights and the rise of black

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.100
power.&nbsp; And Madison
Moore, in American Studies,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.100
is studying the politics
of beauty in the American

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.100
fashion history, currently
writing on Somali supermodel

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.100
Iman.&nbsp; The books for the
course--you should have the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.100
syllabus, by the way, that
was by both doors--the books

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.100
for the course are at
Labyrinth.&nbsp; The books are

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100
also on closed reserve at
Bass Library.&nbsp; There are

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
movies during Week Three and
during Week Eight that are

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.100
not shown in class.&nbsp; They're
shown in the evenings,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100
on probably Monday and
Tuesday.&nbsp; Details on that

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
will be forthcoming, of
course.&nbsp; There is a course

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.100
website that you can find
via the class's server.&nbsp; In

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.100
fact, when you go there,
that should be the first

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.100
thing you see.&nbsp; A note about
the website: I will not be

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100
talking about it in
this class. I will not be

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.100
referencing it in this
class.&nbsp; The way to make best

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100
use of the website--and
it's not mandatory for this

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100
class--the way to make the
best use of it though is on

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.100
Sunday night, before
you come to class,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.100
take the time to look at
that week's overview.&nbsp; I'm

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.100
not even going to promise
all the links at the bottom

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.100
of each page of the
overview are actually active

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.100
anymore.&nbsp; Read the
overview.&nbsp; You will see in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.100
that overview the concept,
the core of what I'll be

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.100
talking about that week.&nbsp;
Also notice at the bottom of

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.100
that overview page
is keywords.&nbsp; I'll be

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.100
talking--I talk often
about keywords in lectures.&nbsp;

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.100
You'll see me reference
these later on. You'll find

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.100
a lot of the same
keywords on the webpage,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.100
and so you will know
coming into class,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.100
if you look at this
website on Sunday,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.100
or on Saturday night, since
you're not going to be doing

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.500
anything else but
preparing for this class,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.567
you will come in prepared to
understand what I think are

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:21.100
the most important things
to know for that particular

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.600
week's worth of lectures.&nbsp;
So the website's on the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.000
class's
server.&nbsp; It's a tool;

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.267
it's supplementary. Do
take advantage of it. Course

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:28.667
requirements: I
mentioned that Ruthie,

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:30.900
Chris and Jane are teaching
writing intensive sections.&nbsp;

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.967
We have two different types
of ways to take this class.&nbsp;

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:35.900
You can take them
through writing intensive,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900
and therefore satisfy the
distribution requirement in

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.867
that area, or take
them through the,

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.100
quote, regular route.&nbsp;
They have different sets of

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.900
obligations, although the
course is the same as far as

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.867
substance.&nbsp; It's all
outlined in the syllabus,

00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:48.267
but essentially for
writing intensive,

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.200
you'll be writing
twenty pages of papers,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.167
a midterm paper
and a term paper,

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.967
with drafts along the way.&nbsp;
It's not supposed to be a

00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:57.200
harder way to do the class.&nbsp;
It's simply a different way,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200
a way to bolster your
writing skills.&nbsp; For the

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200
other, for the regular path,
you'll be taking a midterm

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200
and a two-part exam, fairly
straightforward survey

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.200
course set of expectations,
as far as that is

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200
concerned.&nbsp; Now, with that
little piece of business out

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200
of the way, let me get to
the actual substance of the

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200
bulk of today's lecture.&nbsp;
This class is about the

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200
post-emancipation African
American experience.&nbsp; It is

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200
about American history.&nbsp; And
I hope that point is frankly

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200
very obvious, but one never
quite understands or can

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200
anticipate all of these
things. It is about American

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200
history fundamentally.&nbsp;
At its course,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200
at its core excuse me, the
course is about citizenship,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200
the most important keyword
for the entire class.&nbsp; The

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200
course is about citizenship,
how one becomes a citizen,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200
what one does to preserve
that citizenship.&nbsp; At its

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200
core then, the class asks
the question: what does it

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
mean to be American?&nbsp; Now
I will ask this question

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
explicitly a few
times in the class,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
but it implicitly is woven
through so much of what I'm

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200
going to be talking about.
What does it mean to be

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200
American?&nbsp; Now we started
today talking about or

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200
listening to an excerpt of
Douglass's famous oration

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200
from 1852.&nbsp; Now I want to
move backward even further,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.200
another eighty years or
so, going from a rather

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.200
well-known document and a
quite famous individual to a

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200
rather unknown document
and to someone who is

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200
essentially lost to
history.&nbsp; I want to talk

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
about events in the 1770s.&nbsp;
One quick tangent though:

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.200
when I was about
four or five years old,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200
living near
Concord, Massachusetts,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200
my mother would take me on
field trips.&nbsp; She'd try them

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200
out on me before taking her
first and second graders.&nbsp;

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
And one day she took me to
Minuteman Park. Has anybody

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200
been to Minuteman
Park?&nbsp; It's beautiful,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200
right?&nbsp; It's
gorgeous.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
the site of the start of the
Revolutionary War.&nbsp; So I'm

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200
with my four and five year
old attention span listening

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200
to the tour guides walking
through these beautiful

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200
fields and
meadows.&nbsp; Afterwards,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200
we were driving
around a country road,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200
and I point to these
stone walls and said,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
"Mom, those are like the
walls the Minutemen hid

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200
behind from those
stories."&nbsp; She said,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200
"Jonathan, those are the
walls."&nbsp; Four or five years

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200
old, I mean, I was not
really thinking in grand,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200
historical terms.&nbsp; Life did
not exist beyond my four or

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200
five years as far as I
understood it.&nbsp; But at that

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200
moment, I sort of was
astonished that these

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200
stories, these fun
little stories that I'd been

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200
hearing for the
past hour or so,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.200
whatever it
was, in the tour,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200
were actually true, that
something existed beyond my

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200
own existence on the
planet.&nbsp; Looking backwards,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200
I like to think that that's
when I became a historian,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
although I would try to be
an orthopedic surgeon and

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200
then a lawyer.&nbsp; That stopped
after a couple of weeks of

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.000
college.&nbsp; But I can
look back and think that I

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.300
learned something that day,
that there was something

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:06.000
about--something larger than
myself around me.&nbsp; Near the

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.067
Minuteman Park, there's
also a cemetery.&nbsp; At that

00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:14.967
cemetery, there's a
headstone.&nbsp; My mother didn't

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:16.700
take me on this field trip;
went with other people,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.100
and did charcoal rubbings
of headstones in Concord

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.667
cemeteries.&nbsp; The story
behind this headstone is

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.000
where I want to
start this course,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
really.&nbsp; It's a story about
a man named John Jack.&nbsp; It's

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.367
a story about an individual
who certainly understood

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:38.467
very well about a sense,
the existence of forces much

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:48.000
larger than himself
determining his life.&nbsp; The

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.867
epitaph reads, excuse me:
"God wills us free.&nbsp; Man

00:08:55.867 --> 00:09:02.000
wills us slave.&nbsp; I will
as God wills God's will be

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.267
done."&nbsp; That's the opening
lines.&nbsp; I know it's a little

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:08.500
bit tough to make out.
It's on the course website,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.100
by the way, the first week.&nbsp;
"God wills us free.&nbsp; Man

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.600
wills us slave.&nbsp; I will
as God wills God's will be

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.067
done.&nbsp; Here lies the
body of John Jack,

00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:23.400
native of Africa,
who died March 1773,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.567
aged about 60 years.&nbsp; Though
born in the land of slavery,

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.867
he was born free.&nbsp; Though he
lived in a land of liberty,

00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:35.467
he lived a slave, till by
his honest though stolen

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.700
labors, he acquired the
source of slavery which gave

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.200
him his freedom.&nbsp; Though
not long before Death,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.700
the grand tyrant, gave him
his final emancipation and

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.667
set him on a footing with
kings.&nbsp; Though a slave to

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.500
vice, he practiced those
virtues without which kings

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.667
are but slaves." It's a
remarkable document.&nbsp; My

00:09:57.667 --> 00:09:59.200
mother did this head
rubbing--this stone

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.500
rubbing--a charcoal
rubbing of the headstone,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.200
had it framed.&nbsp; It hung in
my family's house. I walked

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:11.067
past this image for
about fifteen years before I

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:15.200
actually read it.&nbsp; I'm not
saying the guy was bright. I

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.767
look at the opening lines,
about nineteen or twenty

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:20.567
years old, and I'm floored.&nbsp;
"God wills us free.&nbsp; Man

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:23.967
wills us slave.&nbsp; I will as
God wills&nbsp; God's will be

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:28.367
done."&nbsp; It's astonishing.&nbsp;
Couple of years later,

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:31.200
I'm heading to grad school,
and I look at the headstone

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.367
again, and I'm thinking
grand thoughts about going

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:36.100
to study American history.&nbsp;
And I start reading the

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.900
epitaph all over again,
and I start seeing all these

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.967
connections, these
dualisms, God and man,

00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:48.800
freedom and slavery.&nbsp; And
so I decided to acquire the

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.900
headstone. &nbsp;I took it from
my parents' house.&nbsp; I told

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.400
them about it once I had it
on my wall in my apartment

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.300
at grad school.&nbsp; And through
my mother's good graces,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.467
I still have it.&nbsp; It hangs
above my computer.&nbsp; It's

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:04.300
always, it's always with
me.&nbsp; It is something of a

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.567
totem.&nbsp; Now the story about
John Jack I think is even

00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:13.100
more interesting than the
headstone.&nbsp; So we know that

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.500
John Jack, certainly
not his birth name,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.800
a black African, born in
the continent somewhere in

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.200
Africa, a continent with
thousands of years history

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.267
of slavery, still
present today of course.&nbsp; He

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:31.567
survives the Middle
Passage.&nbsp; He comes to--and

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:34.800
he's born free in Africa
but is enslaved somehow--he

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.600
comes over to what will
become the United States.&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.567
It's not quite the United
States. John Jack would

00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:43.100
never see the United
States.&nbsp; He comes to

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.300
colonial New England.&nbsp; Now
this point's just important

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.767
on its surface.&nbsp; We're going
to hear a lot about the

00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:51.967
South in this class.&nbsp; If you
think geographically about

00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:53.300
so many of the
freedom struggles,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.967
the post-emancipation
African American experience,

00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:58.867
they are southern stories.&nbsp;
But don't let yourself be

00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:01.200
fooled.&nbsp; Slavery was alive
and well in New England,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.100
and a lot of the freedom
struggles that have happened

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.800
since emancipation certainly
happened up in New England

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.400
as well.&nbsp; Anyway, John
Jack winds up in Concord,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.367
Massachusetts.&nbsp; He has, as
the saying would have been

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:18.467
at the time, "a kind master"
who teaches him a trade.&nbsp;

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.167
He's a cobbler,
works on shoes,

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.500
and allows him to keep a
little bit of every shoe he

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.000
cobbles.&nbsp; The amount of
money's immaterial.&nbsp; It

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.167
wouldn't have been
much.&nbsp; Over time,

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:32.900
through his stolen labors,
his "honest though stolen

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.100
labors" as the epitaph says,
he acquired the source of

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.700
slavery.&nbsp; He raised enough
money to buy himself.&nbsp; He

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.100
secured his own emancipation
through his hard work.&nbsp; He

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.400
acquires some land
on the edge of town,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400
a subsistence farm, nothing
much more than that.&nbsp;

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.400
And then we discover that he
drinks himself to death.&nbsp;

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.100
Between the time of
his emancipation--his

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.567
self-emancipation and his
death--he tries to become a

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:05.567
citizen of Concord.&nbsp; He
couldn't do it.&nbsp; He was

00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:08.300
male, an important
criteria.&nbsp; Check that one

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.167
off.&nbsp; He owned property.&nbsp;
Those were usually the two

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:15.100
most important criteria.&nbsp;
But because he had been

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.400
enslaved, he couldn't become
a citizen. Let's think of

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.067
the moment.&nbsp; We are on the
cusp of the Revolutionary

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:25.100
War, in Concord,
Massachusetts,

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.600
the start of the
Revolutionary War. You have

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.100
the citizens of
Concord, the white,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.100
male property
owners in Concord,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.700
complaining to the British
crown about being treated as

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.500
slaves.&nbsp; This is
literally their language,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.900
that they were being
treated as slaves,

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:46.000
and this wasn't
right.&nbsp; Somehow these people

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.600
questing for freedom ignored
those people they owned.&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.100
The black African
slaves in their midst,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:01.067
they were blind to
their existence,

00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:05.300
apparently.&nbsp;
John Jack, though,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.867
understood the situation.&nbsp;
He saw what was happening

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:12.167
all around him.&nbsp; He
couldn't help but,

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:13.900
and who knows why he
became an alcoholic,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.800
but that might be a
good reason.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.500
he's drinking himself
to death and knows it,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.900
and he hires an attorney to
put his affairs in order.&nbsp;

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.200
It's his attorney who crafts
the epitaph here.&nbsp; Here's

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.900
where the story gets
even more interesting,

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.967
I think.&nbsp; The person
John Jack hires to put his

00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:40.567
affairs in order is a
British sympathizer,

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:46.700
a Tory.&nbsp; John Jack got
it. &nbsp;He was going to

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.500
hire--almost like
he's thumbing his nose

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.100
postmortem.&nbsp; He wasn't
going to be allowed to be a

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.500
citizen,
despite his freedom,

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.300
in an area that's
fighting for freedom,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.500
claiming that they
weren't citizens,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500
they were slaves in fact,
and they certainly didn't

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.800
know slavery like he knew
it.&nbsp; John Jack understood

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.700
something fundamental about
what would become the United

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.167
States of America,
pretty soon in fact. And the

00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:11.600
fundamental thing he
understood is that you

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.267
cannot understand freedom,
that thing that is at the

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:17.300
bedrock of what
this country is about,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.000
you cannot understand
it without understanding

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.700
slavery.&nbsp; Freedom and
slavery were intertwined,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.400
intertwined for the
citizens on the ground,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400
intertwined for
people like John Jack,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.700
Frederick
Douglass, of course,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:35.000
and others after.&nbsp; You could
not separate the denial of

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.500
freedom from the quest of
freedom.&nbsp; That's why the

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.200
citizens of Concord knew it
was so important.&nbsp; They may

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.900
not have wanted to have
John Jack be a citizen,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:54.167
but they didn't want to be
like him.&nbsp; Two hundred years

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:56.800
later, after John Jack's
attorney produces this

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.300
epitaph--not quite
two hundred years,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.700
let's say one hundred and
eighty or so--Ralph Ellison,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.000
one of the great writers
of the American past,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.167
identifies much of the same
phenomenon that John Jack

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.500
must have identified and
that John Jack's attorney

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.967
certainly understood.&nbsp;
And he wrote this brilliant

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:20.600
passage.&nbsp; I'll probably
use it again later on in the

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.767
course.&nbsp; Ellison wrote,&nbsp;
"Southern whites cannot

00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:28.067
talk, walk, sing,
conceive of laws or justice,

00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:33.800
think of sex,
love, the family,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.267
or freedom, without
responding to the presence

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:44.600
of Negroes."&nbsp; They
are intertwined,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.467
linked fate, as it were.&nbsp;
Now this course is going to

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.700
spend a fair amount of time
examining this phenomenon,

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.800
the linkage between
freedom--not so much freedom

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.700
and slavery, but citizenship
and the denial of

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.800
citizenship.&nbsp; And
we're going to spend time

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.700
investigating how
this challenge,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.767
this problem, this tension,
can be located in unexpected

00:17:11.767 --> 00:17:17.767
places.&nbsp; We'll turn to
primary sources of all types

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:23.600
in order to examine this
story.&nbsp; One place is a great

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.800
example is just in currency,
stuff you're carrying--well,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.100
we don't carry much in terms
of dollars and change any

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.600
more, it's on
credit cards, I suppose,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.900
debit cards.&nbsp; But
back in the day,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.800
a few years ago, when we all
carried cash--the story of a

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.900
nation's myth is embodied on
its currencies.&nbsp; These are

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.900
two examples of Confederate
scrip.&nbsp; I wish I could make

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.967
them bigger.&nbsp; They're
actually JPEG screen

00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:58.600
captures.&nbsp; They really
aren't--they pixilate pretty

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:06.000
quickly.&nbsp; But you can see on
these dollar bills stories

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.800
that were important to
the Confederate States of

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.700
America.&nbsp; A one-dollar bill
and a ten-dollar bill.&nbsp; And

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.400
the stories that are
important are here,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.300
going back one image.&nbsp;
Use my mouse here.&nbsp; Here,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.067
then down here.&nbsp; What
you see is labor and white

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:34.067
womanhood, and the laborer
you see is a slave. &nbsp;And I

00:18:34.067 --> 00:18:36.900
know it doesn't show it
very clearly in this JPEG,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.700
but the laborer is happy.&nbsp;
The slave carrying the

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.100
cotton is smiling.
&nbsp;On the other bill,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.700
you have white womanhood.
You're going to see this is

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.367
quite a fascinating
trope in American history,

00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:57.900
southern American history:
the exalted white woman,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.100
especially as it
pertains to black men,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.800
with tropes of
violence, and danger,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:12.400
and sexual predation woven
throughout that dynamic.&nbsp; So

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.467
on the money that
Confederates were handing to

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:16.500
one another to
exchange goods,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.000
you have happy labor,
you have exalted white

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.200
womanhood.&nbsp;
Notions of who belongs,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.267
the myths that form
our nation states,

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:32.100
are all around us.&nbsp; They're
on the money that we carry.&nbsp;

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.467
We're going to look for
stories like this in all

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:38.800
manner of places, and
through looking at these

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.600
stories, we're going to see
that the post-emancipation

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.200
African American experience
is several different types

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.500
of histories.&nbsp; It's a
history of political

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:54.100
struggle, no doubt.&nbsp; An
image here of black woman

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:02.000
voting, the 1950s I believe,
from the same night--and the

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.400
history behind an image
like that is filled with all

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.867
kinds of political struggle
that you certainly have at

00:20:06.867 --> 00:20:12.200
least a slim awareness of,
a glimmer of awareness of.&nbsp;

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.600
But on the same night,
in the same district,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:24.067
that struggle is embodied by
this.&nbsp; The risk she took in

00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:29.567
voting were risks that
involved her life.&nbsp; It's a

00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:32.900
history of political
struggle in this country.&nbsp;

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.600
Certainly a history of
social protest as well.&nbsp; You

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.967
have here an image of women
from a group called the

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:43.000
National Association
of Colored Women,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.567
the "upstanding
women of the race,

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:47.900
 and I use that in quotation
marks for reasons we'll

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.100
understand in a few weeks.&nbsp;
Not that they weren't

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.400
upstanding, but it's a very
loaded phrase on purpose.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.100
&nbsp;Marching at the White House
in this case to protest the

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.900
lack of an anti lynching
law. "Protect life and

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.300
liberty!" they're
exclaiming.&nbsp; It's a history

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.500
of social
struggle.&nbsp; It's a history,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.000
certainly, of social
control.&nbsp; There are some

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.367
images that don't need much
in the way of narration.&nbsp; I

00:21:16.367 --> 00:21:18.567
will point out though--I
mean actually I don't know

00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:20.900
the history of the image,
but if you look closely,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.767
you'll see Spanish language
up here in the archways.&nbsp; I

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:25.900
think this actually
happens in Laredo,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:34.100
Texas, this Klan rally.&nbsp;
It is also a history of

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.700
cultural celebration.&nbsp; We'll
spend a few lectures doing

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.767
occasional close
readings of important icons,

00:21:43.767 --> 00:21:47.367
images, sound clips,
movie clips in fact,

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:48.867
from the post-emancipation
African American

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:53.700
experience.&nbsp; This is
one image of a series of

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.100
paintings by the artist
Aaron Douglas.&nbsp; I'm not

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.500
going to go into it now,
because I will go into it in

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.167
about a month and a half, I
think.&nbsp; But I will tell you

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:05.967
that in this history of
cultural celebration,

00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:09.800
the images that we'll be
seeing are complicated,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.000
deeply loaded with many
different stories in the

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.967
same spirit of John Jack's
epitaph.&nbsp; The stories are in

00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:21.667
this image here, and I'll
explain it in more detail as

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:30.100
we get to it. It's
also a history of powerful

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.300
relevance today.&nbsp; We
are being trained,

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.600
people are
trying to train us,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.100
to talk about this moment as
being a post-racial moment.&nbsp;

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.000
I actually think it couldn't
be anything further from the

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.567
truth.&nbsp; The election of
Barack Obama--now excuse me,

00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:55.400
I got ahead of my notes one
section here.&nbsp; History of

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.100
powerful relevance today for
many of its political and

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.800
cultural symbols.&nbsp; Prior
to the election of Barack

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.467
Obama, you have
battles over flags,

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:10.367
state flags.&nbsp; This is
the state flag of Georgia,

00:23:10.367 --> 00:23:12.167
had been the state
flag of Georgia,

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:14.500
flying above the
Capitol, on license plates,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.267
you name it.&nbsp; The
Confederate battle flag,

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:19.900
as many of you know,
is a powerful symbol

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.000
of--depending on
your perspective,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.067
tradition and heritage or
violence and degradation.&nbsp;

00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:33.900
There's not much gray area
when it comes to the battle

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.100
flag.&nbsp; As NAACP organized
protests about flying

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.100
something with the
Confederate flag on state

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.400
property, and southern
legislatures refused to back

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.367
down--Interestingly
enough, the NFL,

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:51.300
National Football League,
has done incredible work in

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.767
getting rid of the symbols
and markers of a segregated

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.967
past, for fear of
threatening boycotts,

00:23:57.967 --> 00:24:00.600
removing the Super
Bowl from say Atlanta,

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.300
because of the Confederate
battle flag.&nbsp; And,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.567
in fact, doing something
like this in Arizona over

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.700
the fact that Arizona did
not recognize Martin Luther

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.867
King Day as a state holiday.
The battle ensues over these

00:24:12.867 --> 00:24:17.767
flags in Georgia, and one
option is going to be this

00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:19.767
flag that incorporates all
the different flags from

00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:24.767
Georgia's past, and this is
the final cleaning up as it

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:30.000
were of southern history.&nbsp;
Now it's a history of

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.300
powerful relevance today.&nbsp;
This is a handful of years

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.667
ago.&nbsp; Moving to more
local events in history,

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:40.700
we can think now about the
election of Barack Obama.&nbsp;

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.567
Two years ago when I
was teaching this class,

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:46.200
Obama and Clinton were
heading into the Democratic

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.900
primaries, and I'll confess,
I thought Hillary Clinton

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.967
had this thing locked up.&nbsp;
And then this young senator

00:24:56.967 --> 00:25:00.700
from Illinois goes on a
historic tear.&nbsp; And as I'm

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.700
giving the lecture
course, I'm like,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.367
"Wow, I've got to rewrite
the end of my class."&nbsp; And

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:06.500
then during that
election campaign,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.000
there was the
Reverend Wright scandal,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.900
and Barack Obama's famous
speech in Philadelphia

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.100
during spring break, which
is when I really had to

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.500
rewrite the end of my
class.&nbsp; After the class is

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.900
over, he goes and gets
elected.&nbsp; Some of you were

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.300
here from that moment.&nbsp; This
is a screen capture from the

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.900
Yale Daily the next
day, after Obama wins the

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.167
election. There's a moment
here of the student carrying

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:37.567
one of the iconic images
in the Obama campaign about

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:43.000
hope, and a suggestion of
a new day.&nbsp; Then again,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.500
the suggestion of a
post-racial day.&nbsp; Now I

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.500
don't want to deny the fact
that this is an historical

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.000
election for all
manner of reasons,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.767
whether it was Hillary
Clinton who won or Barack

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:54.667
Obama who won, if a
Democrat was to win,

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:57.400
it was going to be
historic.&nbsp; I don't want to

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:03.200
minimize that.&nbsp; But I also
don't want to buy into the

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.200
fact that simply because
the nation has elected a

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.067
President who is
ostensibly black,

00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:15.367
and I say that very
purposefully--if you think

00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:17.767
about racial coding, as we
get later on in this course,

00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:21.000
you'll understand better why
I say "ostensibly black." I

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.067
don't put any political
meaning in that phrase,

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:26.067
by the way.&nbsp; I'm not trying
to either prop up or push

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:30.400
down Barack Obama's racial
affiliations.&nbsp; But electing

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.800
a President who's
ostensibly black,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.167
the nation healed itself.&nbsp;
It found a way to get past

00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:41.400
its ugly histories and
its scars. It was a better

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.900
place.&nbsp; It was a more
perfect union.&nbsp; It was

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.700
post-racial.&nbsp; But really,
was it?&nbsp; Let's think more

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.200
locally.&nbsp; Let's go back to
Confederate scrip.&nbsp; As it

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.000
happens, I've been showing
the other Confederate scrip

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.967
for years.&nbsp; And
about a year ago,

00:26:59.967 --> 00:27:02.600
I discovered that, somewhere
in the last couple of years,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.000
Yale bought a huge
collection of Confederate

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.567
scrip.&nbsp; It now has the
largest collection in the

00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:13.467
world of Confederate scrip.&nbsp;
Just one of these things.&nbsp;

00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:14.467
[Professor
laughs.]&nbsp; Actually,

00:27:14.467 --> 00:27:17.400
they are
beautiful documents,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.500
I mean, beautifully
constructed.&nbsp; So I went up

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.100
to the
numismatic--numsistatic--it'

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.267
s one of the words
you don't want to flub,

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:29.900
but I just did--collection
at Sterling Library and

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.600
looked at the Confederate
scrip.&nbsp; And I was floored

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.967
when I saw this
image.&nbsp; I'm like,

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:37.967
"Can you scan this
for my purposes,

00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:47.400
please?"&nbsp; You have
happy labor.&nbsp; You have Lady

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.400
Liberty.&nbsp; This is happy
labor.&nbsp; And you have this

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.967
man.&nbsp; Those of you who
know the residential college

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:02.800
system at Yale,
which is all of you,

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.800
will know that one of them
is named Calhoun College.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.400
&nbsp;You will know I'm the
Master of Calhoun College,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.167
which I think is humorous
in just its nomenclature,

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:16.300
certainly.&nbsp; This
is John C. Calhoun,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.600
one of the great men of
Eli, as the Yale Corporation

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.700
thought through the naming
of the residential colleges,

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.800
the first seven back in 1931
and '32.&nbsp; They wanted to

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.567
name the colleges after
the great--the great sons of

00:28:30.567 --> 00:28:32.700
Eli, excuse me.&nbsp;
And they wanted,

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.267
you know, the greatest Yale
alum in the world of arts,

00:28:35.267 --> 00:28:37.500
in the world of letters,
in the world of politics,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.167
and so on.&nbsp; And they decided
that John C. Calhoun,

00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:41.900
an important person,
there's no doubt about it:

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.000
vice-president of
the United States,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.167
powerful senator from South
Carolina--Still revered in

00:28:47.167 --> 00:28:52.767
that state as one of its
great heroes.&nbsp; They decided

00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:54.767
that John C. Calhoun was
their greatest alum.&nbsp; There

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:57.200
is no financial connection
from the name or the family

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.700
to the college, but this
was the logic of 1932,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.600
'33, Yale Corporation.&nbsp;
John C. Calhoun was the

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.500
architect--although he did
not live to see the Civil

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.100
War--he was the intellectual
architect for secession.&nbsp; He

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.600
believed in states' rights,
an important theme of this

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.467
course that we'll be talking
much more in detail about

00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:25.367
later on.&nbsp; And he certainly
did not believe that slaves

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:28.900
were fully equipped to
handle the rigors of

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.567
civilization. It may
sound like kind of a strange

00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:36.867
sentence construction.&nbsp; They
weren't ready to handle the

00:29:36.867 --> 00:29:39.900
rigors of being civilized,
but this is the language of

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:47.067
the day.&nbsp; I wonder, as I
look up in the Master's

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:49.600
house living room,
or in my office,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.700
or in the courtyard--and
there's images of Calhoun

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.400
all over the dang
place in the college,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.000
I have to wonder what he
thinks.&nbsp; History's rather

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.900
humorous sometimes, and
the ironies can be rather

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.967
beautiful.&nbsp; But the
phenomenon of thinking about

00:30:05.967 --> 00:30:08.267
race, or not
thinking about race,

00:30:08.267 --> 00:30:13.600
not talking about race, is
with us today.&nbsp; It is all

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.800
around us.&nbsp; Now thinking
about Confederate scrip from

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.500
quite some time ago, you
know we aren't carrying that

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.467
around in our pockets after
all.&nbsp; How's that a reminder

00:30:25.467 --> 00:30:28.700
of today, thinking about a
decision that some people

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:32.200
made in 1933?&nbsp; That's not
today's thinking.&nbsp; You know,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.267
how is this with us today?&nbsp;
Thinking about race is with

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:43.300
us today in the astonishing
ways that people make their

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:49.800
decisions and maintain their
blindnesses.&nbsp; Two years ago,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.500
the freshman class at
Yale--some of you might be

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500
in this room who were in
that decision process.&nbsp; I'm

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.300
not going to call you
out--decided to have for

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.400
their freshman ball the
theme called Gone with the

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.367
Wind. Student:&nbsp; That
was last year. Professor

00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:08.800
Jonathan Holloway:&nbsp; Was that
last year? Student:&nbsp; Last

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.867
year. Professor Jonathan
Holloway:&nbsp; Last year.&nbsp; Well,

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:15.400
let's just say when I
heard word of this decision,

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.700
I thought it was a
very curious decision.&nbsp; I

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.700
discovered the more
sort of immature,

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.667
sexually prurient reasons
for calling it "Gone with

00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:24.600
the Wind."&nbsp; I won't get into
those now.&nbsp; But I also know

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.900
that people thought it would
be nice.&nbsp; They're aware that

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.367
the movie Gone with the
Wind is complicated.&nbsp; They

00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:34.700
thought it would be nice to
get dressed up in ball gowns

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.800
and the cotillion style
and go to Commons and have a

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.067
wonderful time.&nbsp; The
blindness though astonished

00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:45.600
me.&nbsp; Getting dressed up
for a cotillion might sound

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:52.000
lovely.&nbsp; People can--Yalies
can make amazing costumes,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.200
but was that really Southern
history?&nbsp; Was that really

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.900
what happened? Was that what
it was all about?&nbsp; You need

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.067
to understand, as I was
telling the students when I

00:32:01.067 --> 00:32:02.967
was raising my
concerns about this,

00:32:02.967 --> 00:32:05.200
that in many places where
you had this plantation

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.700
society, people
dressed up for cotillions,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.967
occupying
buildings built by slaves,

00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:13.400
in many of these places,
most of the people were

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.300
black.&nbsp; Gone with the Wind
kind of erases this history,

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.600
doesn't talk about it. And
the notion that some of the

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.367
most educated people in
the world would fail to

00:32:24.367 --> 00:32:29.700
understand the connection,
or the lack of connection,

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.267
with Gone with the Wind
to our lived experience,

00:32:33.267 --> 00:32:36.467
is rather breathtaking and
rather depressing.&nbsp; So I

00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:42.600
decided, in my next lecture,
that as a teaching moment,

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600
I'd read a poem called
"Southern History" by the

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.900
great poet
Natasha Trethewey,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:52.400
who was here last semester
actually.&nbsp; Professor

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.200
Trethewey says
this: "Before the war,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.600
they were happy," he
said. quoting our textbook.&nbsp;

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.567
(This was senior-year
history class.)

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:03.000
"The slaves
were clothed, fed,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.367
and better off under a
master's care." I watched

00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:10.500
the words blur on the
page.&nbsp; No one raised a hand,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.067
disagreed.&nbsp; Not even
me.nIt was late.

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:16.567
we still had
Reconstruction to cover

00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:18.967
before the test, and -
luckily - three hours of

00:33:18.967 --> 00:33:21.700
watching Gone with the
Wind. "History,

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.967
the teacher said, "of the old
South - a true account

00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:28.567
of how things were back
then." On screen a slave

00:33:28.567 --> 00:33:31.567
stood big as
life: big mouth,

00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:37.000
bucked eyes, our textbook's
grinning proof - a lie my

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.867
teacher guarded.&nbsp; Silent, so
did I." Now the purpose of

00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:48.867
my class is not
to stand silent,

00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:51.500
and I hope you will
take with you that same

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.267
determination.&nbsp; This
is a local history,

00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:57.867
after all.&nbsp; You live in it,
whether you live in Calhoun,

00:33:57.867 --> 00:33:59.767
or whether you happen to
live in Davenport or Pierson

00:33:59.767 --> 00:34:03.600
Colleges who, or
where, two years ago,

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.600
this was spray painted on
the walls outside the dining

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.700
hall: "nigger school."&nbsp; Now
I don't think anybody from

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.000
Yale spray painted this, or
"drama fags" across the way

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.767
at the school of drama. &nbsp;I
don't think for a second

00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:19.500
anybody at Yale spray
painted this.&nbsp; But even

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.067
though we are at Yale does
not mean that we are not in

00:34:23.067 --> 00:34:26.600
New Haven.&nbsp; Even though we
are at Yale does not mean

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.600
that we are being fed by a
population that comes from a

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.400
dramatically different set
of resources than we do,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.800
in a highly segregated,
de facto to be sure,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.100
desegregated,
workforce.&nbsp; It is around us,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.100
we are subsumed in it,
and it is our obligation to

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.200
learn this history, lest we
repeat it.&nbsp; Thank you very

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.200
much, and I'll see
you on Wednesday.

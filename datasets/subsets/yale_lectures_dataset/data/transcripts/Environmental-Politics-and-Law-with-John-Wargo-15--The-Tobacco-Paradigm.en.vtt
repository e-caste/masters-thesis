00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.010
Prof: All right
everybody, let's start in.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.071
So the midterms are graded,
for those of you that are not

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:09.700
doing the paper.
 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.040
And you'll receive them back on
Thursday in class.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.830
And people for the most part
did quite well.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.860
So it's good news.
 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.568
Today I want to talk about
tobacco and the legal paradigm

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.838
that surrounds tobacco,
because it really provides I

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.991
think an interesting comparison
to some of the other legal

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.310
regimes that we've taken a look
at so far in the course,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.000
including those that surround
air quality,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670
pesticides, atomic weapons
testing,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.640
hazardous sites, and plastics.
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.410
So how is tobacco managed?
 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.190
What's its history?
 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.424
And I have come to think about
this history really as a

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.580
conflict of perceptions of
rights and obligations,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.580
particularly the right to
participate in markets,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.228
the right to speak freely,
the right to advertise,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.463
as opposed to the right to be
free from exposure to chemicals

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:09.569
that are recognized to be quite
hazardous.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.784
So all these cases that we've
looked at so far during the term

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:17.378
really have raised questions
about risk and different

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:19.590
approaches to managing risk.
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.084
What are the different legal
strategies that you might think

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.209
about to take on a hazard such
as this?

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:28.730
Well one is taxes.
 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.019
We'll take a look at tax policy
and how tax policy creates a

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.599
dependency relationship between
an industry and governments,

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:43.530
particularly at times like this
of budgetary stress.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.629
We'll take a look also at
place-based restrictions.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:50.830
So preventing the sale of
certain hazardous commodities in

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.400
certain kinds of environments so
that we can no longer purchase

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.970
tobacco products in vending
machines in the United States.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.224
Instead they have to be
purchased over the counter by

00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:05.790
someone who would check
identification.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.789
Sales restrictions of different
sorts, advertising restrictions,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.598
fair warning requirements on
tobacco products.

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:17.551
Also compensation,
how are we going to manage

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:21.377
compensation for those that
claim that they've been harmed

00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:22.720
by the products?
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.949
How are we going to subsidize
the industry?

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.640
You probably know that many
different commodities,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.008
agricultural commodities,
receive rather high subsidies.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.083
So what has been the relative
history of tobacco subsidies

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:39.370
compared to other commodities?
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.657
How about regulating the
chemical content of tobacco,

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:46.377
flavoring agents,
coloring agents,

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:48.440
the shape of tobacco?
 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.288
How about tobacco products
designed to sooth?

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.931
Or how about the regulation of
nicotine itself,

00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:59.310
known to be addictive?
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.758
How about the ban on all
tobacco products?

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:08.038
Has anybody thought about doing
that at any scale?

00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:12.865
Well, many governments have
chosen to ban use of tobacco

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:17.942
products inside buildings,
so public buildings commonly

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:21.740
now restrict the use of tobacco
products.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.090
Also, how about socializing the
industry, an idea that Kessler

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.800
came up with at the end of his
book.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.229
So what's the scale of this
issue in terms of economics?

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.723
About fifty billion dollars
today in consumer spending and

00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:40.913
about fifty million people in
the United States smoke

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:44.038
approximately 600 billion
cigarettes each year.

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:46.800
The overwhelming majority of
those cigarettes,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.359
by the way, are lit and smoked
indoors so that this is very

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.628
much an indoor air quality
issue.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:56.181
About four billion cigars are
smoked also, forty million

00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.410
pounds of tobacco are burned
indoors every year.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.030
How about tobacco-related
illnesses?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.210
There's very little debate
about this,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.784
compared to the other types of
problems that we've looked at

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:10.270
that are managed by
environmental law,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.949
including pesticides,
including air pollutants,

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.677
drinking water contaminates
managed by the Safe Drinking

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:19.702
Water Act or chemicals that are
migrating from hazardous waste

00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:20.199
sites.
 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.697
The quality of the scientific
evidence about the effect of

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:27.009
tobacco on human health is
really the gold standard.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.766
It's similar in quality to our
understanding of the role that

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.699
radiation plays in inducing
cancer.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.214
There are also about 470,000
different suppliers,

00:04:38.214 --> 00:04:42.608
wholesalers and retailers that
are highly dependent upon this

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:43.560
industry.
 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.370
So this is a recipe for
enormous conflict in Washington

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.447
about how to use the different
strategies that I just went

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:54.250
over.
 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.100
So the way that the laws have
evolved in the U.S.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.470
was laid out I think fairly
well in Kessler's book.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.663
The strategies that the
government has relied on have

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:09.050
included hazard warnings
predominately,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.869
control over advertising claims
and the use of specific media

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.028
outlets,
age restrictions so that within

00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:20.629
the United States right now the
use of tobacco products,

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.406
the sale of tobacco products is
restricted to those that are

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:27.786
eighteen years and older,
although there are some states

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.536
and some counties that now
demand that you need to be

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:31.699
nineteen years old.
 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.182
For example,
in Nassau County,

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:35.944
Suffolk County in New York,
demand that you be nineteen

00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:36.660
years old.
 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.882
If you look around the world
too, there's quite a bit of

00:05:38.882 --> 00:05:39.449
variability.
 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.182
In some of the poorer nations
of the world,

00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:44.199
you need to be ten years old.
 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.610
In France, you need to be
sixteen years old.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.199
In Japan, you need to be twenty
years old.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.908
So that the idea of age-based
restriction is really quite

00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:54.519
variable across different
jurisdictional boundaries.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.555
Restricting access,
making certain that you can't

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:03.264
just walk up to a machine and
put your now seven or eight

00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:07.889
dollars into it to get your pack
of cigarettes out.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.540
The removal of subsidies,
but not prohibition.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.476
So that Congress considered a
variety of strategies,

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:16.009
but they always backed off of
prohibition.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.358
How about industry strategies
to maintain their share of the

00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:22.939
marketplace, what have they
done?

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.442
Well, one of the first things
that they did was to focus the

00:06:26.442 --> 00:06:29.410
issue, focus government's
attention on labeling.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.007
And as with pesticide labeling
and the labeling of

00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:36.458
pharmaceuticals and food
products, labeling is a

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:40.129
problematic form of conveying a
sense of risk.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.475
This is especially different
than pesticides or some drugs in

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:48.949
that the product itself is
addictive.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.449
It's addictive predominately
because of the nicotine content.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.863
The industry also fought to
confuse the evidentiary base on

00:06:57.863 --> 00:06:59.449
health effects.
 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.932
So just like nuclear weapons
and just like pesticides and

00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:05.795
pharmaceuticals,
the knowledge about the danger

00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.470
grew from the industry research
itself.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.500
So the American Tobacco
Institute, for example,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.773
might be thought of similarly
to the Atomic Energy Commission

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:19.547
or to the pesticide companies
that conducted their own

00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:23.607
analyses of data so that they
became the source of data to

00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:27.382
demonstrate the absence of a
clear understanding about

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:29.589
adverse health effects.
 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:33.762
Also in advertising,
they really took very bold

00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:35.930
moves--
and I'll go through a variety

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.399
of different advertising
strategies today with you--

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:43.550
to associate tobacco use with
the ideas of freedom,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.319
values of nature,
also sociability and sexuality.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:50.009
So the imagery is very
important.

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.341
It's extremely important,
and also quite persuasive to

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:54.410
the very young.
 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.983
They focused on the costs of
regulations, not the costs of

00:07:57.983 --> 00:07:58.800
healthcare.
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.057
And it's quite interesting to
think about the sea change that

00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:06.749
occurred as a result of
litigation in Florida against

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:10.439
tobacco companies that resulted
in a settlement.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:14.057
So that many attorneys general
in the United States banded

00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:17.930
together and were able to reach
a settlement for approximately

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.613
two hundred and fifty billion
dollars to be paid out by the

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:24.470
tobacco companies to different
states,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.360
year by year.
 

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.829
A study at Yale just a couple
of years ago demonstrated,

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.086
by the way, that the money that
came into Connecticut did not go

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:37.368
into educational funds,
educational programs to prevent

00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:45.500
tobacco use or to increase the
rate of quitting of tobacco use.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.649
Instead, it was diverted into a
variety of other state needs.

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:52.030
So this balancing of the costs
of regulation,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.720
as opposed to the benefits of
the product, has been central in

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.950
their logic.
 

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.038
Also, the idea of preemption.
 

00:09:01.038 --> 00:09:04.767
Just as pesticides are
preempted so that they can't be

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:08.283
regulated differently,
the labeling can't vary from

00:09:08.283 --> 00:09:09.620
state to state.
 

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.543
So that the tobacco companies
went to the federal government

00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:16.735
and were successful in
preempting state and local

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:20.658
regulation regarding both
labeling and tort litigation.

00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:25.763
So preemption basically
prevents this patchwork quilt of

00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:30.308
regulations from being imposed
on the industry.

00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:34.216
If you look at the variability
of taxation by state,

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:36.210
it's also quite curious.
 

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.808
So that in the state of Rhode
Island,

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:44.096
the state tax is about two
dollars and forty-six cents per

00:09:44.096 --> 00:09:46.320
pack,
whereas the state of Kentucky

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.259
it was down to three cents per
pack,

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:49.500
and this is several years ago.
 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.350
So states have the authority to
set taxes at different levels.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.039
To give you a sense of the
magnitude of importance to a

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:58.980
state's budget the sales tax
represents,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.570
if California increased the
sales tax by only fifty cents,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.860
it would raise nearly a half a
billion dollars per year.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.501
If New York would increase
their taxes by about fifty

00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.643
cents,
they would increase their

00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:14.105
income, their revenue,
by about a third of a billion

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:14.629
dollars per year.
 

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:19.692
So that states have become
quite highly reliant upon these

00:10:19.692 --> 00:10:23.690
sales taxes as an important form
of income.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.111
How about some of the
statistics about smoking

00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:29.090
prevalence in education?
 

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.660
So as I said at the beginning
of the lecture,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.990
about fifty million people out
of a few over three hundred

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.678
million people in the United
States smoke.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:40.950
But what about their level of
education?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:47.011
And what you see is that
current smokers tend to decline

00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:50.649
as a percentage with education.
 

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.879
Less than high school,
you see here the current

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:58.024
smoking rate is much higher than
it is for those that have a

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.779
university education.
 

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:04.639
So that those that understand
the health effects are less

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:10.020
likely to adopt tobacco use and
they're more likely to consider

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.149
quitting.
 

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:14.918
So to give you a sense also of
the magnitude of tax revenue

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:17.778
across some of the larger
states, the U.S.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:24.365
income is now well over ten
billion dollars per year that

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:26.129
states enjoy.
 

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:32.058
Tobacco also has been a target
for subsidy removal.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:37.067
So compared to corn as an
example, corn enjoys about a one

00:11:37.067 --> 00:11:40.320
and a half billion dollar
subsidy,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.307
or did in 2004,
whereas tobacco subsidies are

00:11:44.307 --> 00:11:47.570
less than a billion dollars
today.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.783
Advertising is a very important
component of the cigarette

00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:55.229
companies' budgets,
so that they are spending today

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:58.341
close to twenty-two billion
dollars on advertising and

00:11:58.341 --> 00:11:59.750
promotional expenses.
 

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.294
And this amounted to about
fifty-three dollars for every

00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:05.230
person in the United States.
 

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.720
This is a twenty-two percent
increase over previous years.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.190
So what you find is,
as the market goes down,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.090
as the adoption rate among the
young go down,

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:21.250
they will vary their targeting
of advertising by gender,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.899
by ethnic group,
as well as by age.

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:28.062
So that expenditures for
advertising have increased in

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:31.404
response to an increase in
regulation and these declining

00:12:31.404 --> 00:12:32.538
adopting rates.
 

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.821
Targeting children through
advertising is an important

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.058
thing to consider.
 

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:40.239
And kind of curiously,
children played an important

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:43.736
role in the evolution of
prohibitive policy with respect

00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:45.200
to nuclear weapons.
 

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.450
They played an important role
in the control of lead.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.674
They played a really important
role in the adoption of the

00:12:51.674 --> 00:12:54.447
tougher particulate matter
standards for pesticide

00:12:54.447 --> 00:12:55.408
restrictions.
 

00:12:55.408 --> 00:13:00.000
So that in this case,
recognition that children are

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.956
especially susceptible to
persuasion by advertising has

00:13:04.956 --> 00:13:10.190
similarly led to recent more
restrictive legislation.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.720
So Joe Camel provides a pretty
interesting example.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.000
This series ran between 1988
and 1997.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.356
And about three thousand new
smokers less than eighteen years

00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:26.590
were picked up per day.
 

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.109
And about a third of these
people, if they persist in their

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.840
habit, will die of
tobacco-related illness.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.908
The appeals are well known to
everybody.

00:13:37.908 --> 00:13:42.186
Here you see Joe Camel with a
woman, an attractive woman in

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.440
the background.
 

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.288
The image is tough,
the image is one of a fighter

00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:47.928
pilot.
 

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:50.668
And there he is,
smoking his cigarette.

00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:55.140
The idea of this series was
modeled after a television show

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.457
called Miami Vice,
really modeled after James Bond

00:13:59.457 --> 00:14:01.000
and Don Johnson.
 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.539
And one study showed that
nearly a third of all three year

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:07.769
olds matched the character to
the cigarette brand.

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:12.046
And among six year olds,
Joe Camel was as familiar as

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:13.278
Mickey Mouse.
 

00:14:13.278 --> 00:14:16.846
So within a matter of three
years, Joe increased Camel's

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:20.479
market share from one to
thirty-three percent in the less

00:14:20.479 --> 00:14:22.620
than eighteen year old range.
 

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.393
Sales increased during that
three-year period by five

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:27.259
hundred million dollars per
year.

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:30.096
And this is believed now to be
one of the most successful

00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:31.870
advertising campaigns in
history.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.240
Now think about the imagery as
well.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.993
So here on the left-hand slide,
you see a woman having

00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:42.888
presumably just reached a
mountain peak and then reached

00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:45.649
into her pocket for a Lucky
Strike.

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:50.157
The Marlboro Man,
also the image of masculinity

00:14:50.157 --> 00:14:54.173
riding a horse,
having just roped a steer,

00:14:54.173 --> 00:14:58.288
also a key symbol for the
corporation.

00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:01.712
Looking back in history,
you can see also the appeal to

00:15:01.712 --> 00:15:05.200
women, and particularly as a
weight control strategy.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.923
So "to keep a slender
figure, no one can deny it's

00:15:08.923 --> 00:15:11.269
wise to reach for a Lucky."
 

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:16.649
And also the appeal to keeping
mom on a steady course.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.828
So here you have a child in the
ad, "Before you scold me,

00:15:19.828 --> 00:15:22.538
Mom, maybe you'd better light
up a Marlboro."

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:24.764
And "Gee,
Mommy, you sure enjoy your

00:15:24.764 --> 00:15:25.710
Marlboro."
 

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.970
So things seem happier in the
family.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.556
So somebody's cranky and
associate the use of tobacco

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:34.320
with a mood swing.
 

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.570
Physicians were enlisted to
support advertising as well.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.779
So here you see some ads from
the 1930s and 1940s.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:46.123
It's actually interesting,
you can go back through these

00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:49.769
old volumes of Life Magazine
or National Geographic

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:53.538
or Time Magazine over
in Sterling Library and take a

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:56.700
look at the patterns in
advertising over time.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.235
So, "Twenty thousand,
six hundred and seventy-nine

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.679
physicians say Luckies are less
irritating,"

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:04.308
and "It's toasted."
 

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:06.980
"More doctors smoke Camels
than any other cigarette."

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.230
Dentists also were part of the
advertising game.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.405
Anybody that has smoked or
knows smokers know that

00:16:14.405 --> 00:16:18.101
cigarettes generally stain
teeth, especially those without

00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:18.879
filters.
 

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:21.508
So the idea that putting a
filter on the end of the tobacco

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:23.230
could remove the dangerous
product,

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:28.490
it could remove the discoloring
agents in the compound,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.960
that's an interesting idea.
 

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.700
Santa Claus even got into the
act for a while.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.058
So "guard against throat
scratch."

00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:39.519
There's also a long history
about reliance on gender.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.110
And women have been extensively
targeted.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.673
Women tend to have lower
adoption rate than men do by

00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:48.690
four or five percent in the
United States.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.380
And the dominant marketing
strategy has been one to rest on

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.750
themes of both social
desirability and independence.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.116
And these are normally conveyed
by thin, attractive,

00:17:01.116 --> 00:17:02.570
and athletic models.
 

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.153
This history goes back quite a
ways, and you see it in

00:17:06.153 --> 00:17:08.788
different parts of the world as
well.

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:13.057
So that the highest estimates
for cigarette smoking among

00:17:13.057 --> 00:17:17.858
women tend to be in the southern
and tobacco-growing states,

00:17:17.858 --> 00:17:21.308
such as Kentucky,
where it's about 28.1 percent.

00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:24.327
Whereas nationally,
only eighteen percent of women

00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:24.818
smoke.
 

00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:29.192
Also, you can recognize certain
patterns of reliance of

00:17:29.192 --> 00:17:33.160
different brands on different
types of imagery.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.436
So whereas Marlboro
concentrated on kind of a

00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:40.309
machismo image of masculinity,
Virginia Slims instead

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.288
concentrated their efforts on
women.

00:17:43.288 --> 00:17:46.096
Always slim women,
always tough women,

00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:50.650
"Yeah, I got a tattoo and
no, you can't see it."

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.067
So the image of sexuality and
also strength dominated their

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:55.828
imagery.
 

00:17:55.828 --> 00:18:00.540
The tobacco companies also
tried to influence cultural

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.875
acceptance of tobacco products
by encouraging actors to smoke

00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:08.354
on stage,
encouraging producers,

00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:11.553
providing subsidies so that
tobacco use was noted in about

00:18:11.553 --> 00:18:14.471
seventy-five percent of all
movies that were reviewed

00:18:14.471 --> 00:18:17.108
several years ago and
forty-three percent of the

00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:20.532
movies showed scenes in which
tobacco use could be interpreted

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:24.160
as attractive,
with qualities described by

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.990
teenagers as sexy,
exciting, powerful,

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.048
cool, sophisticated,
rebellious, and celebratory.

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:33.194
And twenty-five percent of the
movies included some of the

00:18:33.194 --> 00:18:34.630
anti-tobacco statements.
 

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.288
Top-billed actors lit up in
fifty-nine percent of all movies

00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:38.970
reviewed.
 

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.839
Another example of Virginia
Slims advertising.

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:46.009
Riding a motorcycle.
 

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:50.345
The idea that you would take on
risks, not only riding a

00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:54.048
motorcycle, but also riding
without a helmet.

00:18:54.048 --> 00:18:58.140
So that the idea that you're
tough,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.300
you're attractive,
you're slim,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.550
these are all images that are
very strategically designed to

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.640
encourage adoption rates.
 

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.465
In different parts of the
world, you find different ethnic

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:12.640
groups being targeted using a
variety of different strategies.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.632
So Virginia Slims also tried to
create the idea that

00:19:16.632 --> 00:19:21.328
independence and cultural pride
are linked to tobacco use.

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:24.750
So that there's a terrific
amount of variability.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.348
Also, the promotion of
different kinds of events.

00:19:27.348 --> 00:19:30.338
When I was a kid and we'd go to
rock concerts,

00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:34.644
people would commonly be there
with these big trays hung over

00:19:34.644 --> 00:19:38.519
their shoulders with
sample-sized tobacco packages,

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:41.720
four or five cigarettes in a
carton,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.519
and they were given out freely.
 

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:46.405
In some bars,
the promotional activities also

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:48.900
freely distributed tobacco
products.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.001
In this case,
you probably recognize or knew

00:19:52.001 --> 00:19:55.826
that different kinds of races
and athletic events were

00:19:55.826 --> 00:19:58.279
sponsored by different groups.
 

00:19:58.279 --> 00:20:00.002
Virginia Slims,
for example,

00:20:00.002 --> 00:20:03.259
was quite active in promoting
tennis tournaments.

00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:07.798
The Virginia Slims Invitational
is an example of that.

00:20:07.798 --> 00:20:11.750
NASCAR racing was promoted by
Lucky Strike.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.078
The Marlboro 500 is another
stock car race.

00:20:16.078 --> 00:20:19.878
My dad, when he was in World
War II, he would,

00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:23.846
after he came back,
he always told stories about

00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:25.618
his K-Ration Kit.
 

00:20:25.618 --> 00:20:29.163
So that they were given
K-Rations, which often included

00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:32.048
Spam, but also peanuts and
chocolate bars.

00:20:32.048 --> 00:20:37.980
And he would tell about always
having a cigarette pack freely

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.650
available to all the GIs.
 

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.519
What a brilliant advertising
technique,

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:45.630
recognizing the addictive power
of tobacco,

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.234
how few cigarettes it really
takes to cause a physical

00:20:49.234 --> 00:20:52.152
addiction,
and putting them into every

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:54.858
K-Ration,
virtually ensuring that you

00:20:54.858 --> 00:20:59.243
would have a high addiction rate
among the GIs once the millions

00:20:59.243 --> 00:21:01.750
of soldiers came back to the
U.S.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.826
Today, if you look on the
internet, you'll find a variety

00:21:04.826 --> 00:21:08.509
of different advertising schemes
in different parts of the world.

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:13.108
RJR Stir the Senses campaign is
a good example.

00:21:13.108 --> 00:21:16.721
And some of them include
product auctions and encourage

00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:20.737
you to become a member so that
they can advertise and provide

00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:24.549
you with information about
different kinds of discounts on

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:28.028
products as well as to promote
their products.

00:21:28.028 --> 00:21:31.059
Now, different countries too
have taken different approaches

00:21:31.059 --> 00:21:31.778
to labeling.
 

00:21:31.778 --> 00:21:34.990
And you know that I'm not a
great fan of labeling as a way

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.019
of conveying knowledge about
risk.

00:21:37.019 --> 00:21:41.064
And I don't think that it
really often helps a consumer to

00:21:41.064 --> 00:21:45.392
understand the true benefits as
opposed to the adverse effects

00:21:45.392 --> 00:21:47.450
associated with products.
 

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.961
But the Canadians have taken a
tougher stance than we have in

00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:50.798
the United States.
 

00:21:50.798 --> 00:21:52.529
Now in the U.S.,
you know that we have these

00:21:52.529 --> 00:21:54.298
little boxes on the sides of the
packets,

00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:56.640
or sometimes on the backs of
the packets,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.400
that may say "Warning:
This product is known to cause

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.192
cancer,"
or "This product is

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:04.048
dangerous to your health,"
or "This product causes

00:22:04.048 --> 00:22:06.180
emphysema or exacerbates
asthma."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.299
So that there are a variety of
different signal phrases that

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:14.211
are required to be cycled
through on the sides of tobacco

00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:15.118
products.
 

00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:19.893
Canada has a system whereby
they demand that the front of

00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:24.068
the package include photographs
of health loss.

00:22:24.068 --> 00:22:28.080
So here's an example of what a
heart looks like after it's had

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.645
an attack, the darker area,
for example,

00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:31.828
in this photo.
 

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:35.608
Another example,
cigarettes cause lung cancer.

00:22:35.608 --> 00:22:38.818
So someone on a heart-lung
machine lying in a hospital.

00:22:38.818 --> 00:22:43.263
Cigarettes hurt babies,
so that an appeal to protection

00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:47.414
of the unborn and of children,
getting people to think more

00:22:47.414 --> 00:22:50.029
carefully about what they're
doing to their young.

00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:53.255
And something that might wake
up teenagers,

00:22:53.255 --> 00:22:56.019
tobacco use can make you
impotent.

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:58.099
Can make you impotent?
 

00:22:58.099 --> 00:22:59.430
That's news to many people.
 

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.796
There are also prevalence rates
that vary by ethnicity so that

00:23:03.796 --> 00:23:06.660
American Indians and Alaskan
natives,

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.551
for example,
have adoption and prevalence

00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:13.384
rates that are far higher than
we have in other ethnic

00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:14.470
minorities.
 

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.961
And also, Asians have one of
the lowest adoption and

00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:21.779
addiction rates in the nation.
 

00:23:21.779 --> 00:23:24.818
Most smokers begin as teens.
 

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:28.920
And this is quite interesting
to me when I saw this.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.700
David Kessler showed this slide
to me.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.944
I'm going to show a series of
slides that he provided when he

00:23:33.944 --> 00:23:35.730
used to lecture in this course.
 

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:40.669
And you see that the adoption
rates begin at a very young age,

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:44.798
so that up to twelve,
thirteen percent occur beneath

00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:46.578
the age of twelve.
 

00:23:46.578 --> 00:23:51.875
Beneath the age of fifteen,
you see roughly twenty-five,

00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:57.460
fifty, maybe about fifty
percent of the age of adoption.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.123
So that the target of youth has
become a very important aspect

00:24:03.123 --> 00:24:08.230
of advertising campaigns among
the tobacco companies.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.346
In fact, RJ Reynolds in 1984
stated that "young smokers

00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:16.673
had been the critical factor in
the growth and decline of every

00:24:16.673 --> 00:24:20.858
major brand and company over the
last fifty years."

00:24:20.858 --> 00:24:25.945
So if you can addict a single
individual who is fifty years

00:24:25.945 --> 00:24:28.377
old,
you will have a much lower rate

00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:32.190
of return than you would if you
could addict a fifteen year old.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:37.980
Another comment by an RJ
Reynolds executive,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.109
"Realistically,
if our company is to survive

00:24:40.109 --> 00:24:43.013
and prosper over the long term,
we must get our share of the

00:24:43.013 --> 00:24:44.009
youth market."
 

00:24:44.009 --> 00:24:48.690
And speaking again,
the executive says:

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.952
"Evidence is now available
to indicate that the fourteen to

00:24:51.952 --> 00:24:54.748
eighteen year old group is an
increasing segment of the

00:24:54.748 --> 00:24:55.940
smoking population.
 

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.557
RJR must soon establish a
successful new brand in this

00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:03.448
market if our position in the
industry is to be maintained

00:25:03.448 --> 00:25:04.950
over the long run.
 

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.599
If we are to attract a
nonsmoker or pre-smoker,

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:10.653
there is nothing in this type
of product that he would

00:25:10.653 --> 00:25:12.670
currently understand or desire.
 

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.380
Instead, we somehow must
convince him with wholly

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.430
irrational reasons that he
should try smoking."

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.068
Very interesting idea.
 

00:25:20.068 --> 00:25:24.626
So here you have a product that
would be disgusting to many

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:27.220
people that had never tried it.
 

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.700
I remember when I smoked my
first cigarette,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.009
I just coughed and sputtered,
my eyes watered,

00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:35.650
I hated the taste and I hated
the smell that I carried around.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:40.261
And so that this was well
recognized by the industry that

00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:44.791
they needed to create other
factors that would encourage

00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:46.440
people to adopt.
 

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:52.160
Now how about the legal
framework that this sits within?

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.419
Well, the Surgeon General's
report that was released in 1964

00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:02.500
was the first thorough and
comprehensive indictment of the

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.778
effect of tobacco products on
human health,

00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:10.568
concluding that it did induce
lung disease.

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:14.574
So that the Federal Trade
Commission at that time began to

00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:16.190
regulate advertising.
 

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.170
And it concluded that cigarette
advertising was deceptive,

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.548
that advertisers had a
responsibility to warn the

00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:24.828
public about the health hazards
of smoking,

00:26:24.828 --> 00:26:27.621
and that the Federal Trade
Commission then proposed

00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:31.083
labeling the amount of tar and
nicotine and include a statement

00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:33.986
such as "Caution:
Cigarette smoking is dangerous

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:34.880
to health.
 

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.460
It may cause death from cancer
or other diseases."

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.406
The idea of preemption
originated with respect to

00:26:42.406 --> 00:26:45.038
tobacco products back in 1965.
 

00:26:45.038 --> 00:26:49.169
And it prohibited the Federal
Trade Commission and States and

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:53.298
local governments from requiring
any other label on cigarette

00:26:53.298 --> 00:26:57.289
packages and any warnings to
cigarette advertising at least

00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:58.460
until 1969.
 

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.980
There's also the Federal
Communications Commission that

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.501
plays an important role here,
particularly the Fairness

00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:06.348
Doctrine.
 

00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:10.268
So by 1967, more money was
spent on television tobacco

00:27:10.268 --> 00:27:13.298
advertising than for any other
product.

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:17.960
And in 1966,
a citizen, John Banzhaf,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.369
wrote to CBS TV in New York and
requested that some other

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:24.538
responsible spokesperson be
given a chance to present

00:27:24.538 --> 00:27:28.314
contrasting views on the issue
of the benefits and advisability

00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:29.348
of smoking.
 

00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:32.630
And the FCC responded and
required a significant amount of

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.759
time to rebut tobacco
advertising,

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:37.856
concluding that "We hold
that the Fairness Doctrine is

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:40.098
applicable to such
advertisements."

00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:44.127
The Fairness Doctrine has its
origin in 1949 in a rule that

00:27:44.127 --> 00:27:48.018
required broadcasters to devote
some of their air time to

00:27:48.018 --> 00:27:52.255
discussing controversial matters
of public interest and to air

00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:55.588
contrasting views regarding
those matters.

00:27:55.588 --> 00:27:59.676
In 1969, the Public Health
Cigarette Smoking Act was

00:27:59.676 --> 00:28:03.925
adopted, and it demanded a
cautionary label with a key

00:28:03.925 --> 00:28:05.930
change in the phrase.
 

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.126
So that "The Surgeon
General has determined that

00:28:08.126 --> 00:28:10.281
cigarette smoking is dangerous
to your health,"

00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:12.480
not "may be dangerous to
your health."

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.844
It also required a blackout of
cigarette commercials as of

00:28:17.844 --> 00:28:20.872
January 1971,
and television and radio

00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:24.425
stations estimated a loss of
about two hundred and twenty

00:28:24.425 --> 00:28:26.328
million dollars in revenue.
 

00:28:26.328 --> 00:28:31.573
So recall that I argued that
this industry creates a very

00:28:31.573 --> 00:28:34.568
large revenue base for states.
 

00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:37.960
It also created a terrific
revenue base in terms of

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.078
advertising for the
communications industry.

00:28:41.078 --> 00:28:45.212
What this means is that the
industry support was quite

00:28:45.212 --> 00:28:48.098
varied and quite wide and
diverse,

00:28:48.098 --> 00:28:53.643
that the tobacco industry had
the capacity to go to Congress

00:28:53.643 --> 00:28:59.000
and find allies that would not
be immediately intuited.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.944
So about seven and a half
percent of their total

00:29:01.944 --> 00:29:05.393
advertising revenue had been
associated with the tobacco

00:29:05.393 --> 00:29:06.960
industry at the time.
 

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.740
So warnings,
advertising,

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.895
and age restrictions between
1965 and 2008 became the key

00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:17.720
targets of Congress when they
enacted six different statutes.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.700
And they required that all
packaging have labels on it.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.413
They required that the
advertisement of tobacco

00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:28.954
products through any electronic
communication medium would be

00:29:28.954 --> 00:29:32.259
prohibited by the Federal
Communications Commission.

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:35.164
And it also required,
these statutes required the

00:29:35.164 --> 00:29:38.736
Secretary of Health and Human
Services to report every three

00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:42.246
years to Congress on research
findings concerning tobacco's

00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:43.759
addictive property.
 

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:47.104
Kind of curiously,
to combat the origin of the

00:29:47.104 --> 00:29:50.969
scientific studies occurring
predominately within the

00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:53.262
industry,
the National Institute of

00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:55.470
Health started funding
independent studies.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:01.231
So that just as you find in the
pharmaceutical industry or in

00:30:01.231 --> 00:30:05.730
the pesticide industry,
the conduct of independent

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.042
science really became quite
important to the government's

00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:14.894
capacity to mount a challenge to
the evidence that was presented

00:30:14.894 --> 00:30:17.048
by the industry itself.
 

00:30:17.048 --> 00:30:20.279
Also, these statutes made
states, the receipt of certain

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:23.862
federal block grants contingent
upon their prohibiting tobacco

00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:27.959
product manufacturer,
retailer, or distributor from

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:33.185
selling these products that
included not just cigarettes but

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:38.679
also cigars and chewing tobacco
to individuals under the age of

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:39.920
eighteen.
 

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.849
So what are the estimated
health effects from tobacco?

00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:46.368
Irritation is well recognized.
 

00:30:46.368 --> 00:30:50.180
Lower respiratory infections
were recognized early.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.430
Reduced lung function.
 

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:57.113
Increased risk for asthma and
exacerbation of asthma among

00:30:57.113 --> 00:30:59.660
those that had it previously.
 

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.539
Nonrespiratory cancers.
 

00:31:02.539 --> 00:31:04.298
Early onset of menopause.
 

00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:09.663
Also environmental tobacco
smoke can cause brain tumors and

00:31:09.663 --> 00:31:11.328
cervical cancer.
 

00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:17.172
That's environmental tobacco
smoke, that's not smoke that's

00:31:17.172 --> 00:31:19.588
inhaled by the smoker.
 

00:31:19.588 --> 00:31:22.702
There are really three
different kinds of smoke that a

00:31:22.702 --> 00:31:24.230
cigarette would produce.
 

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.417
One is the smoke that's inhaled
through the tobacco itself as it

00:31:28.417 --> 00:31:28.950
burns.
 

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.086
The other would be what's
called side-stream smoke that is

00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:34.618
given off by the burning tip of
the product.

00:31:34.618 --> 00:31:37.710
And the third would be the
smoke that's exhaled.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.617
So each is a different complex
of compounds,

00:31:40.617 --> 00:31:44.269
between three and four thousand
different chemicals.

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:47.193
So it's really been a very
difficult task understanding

00:31:47.193 --> 00:31:50.280
which of these chemicals is
responsible for which of these

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.308
health effects.
 

00:31:51.308 --> 00:31:54.410
But this, it's an interesting
problem.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.838
It's similar in respect to
diesel emissions,

00:31:57.838 --> 00:32:01.559
which is also a complex
mixture, so that the effect of

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.720
the mixture has been the subject
of study,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.070
as opposed to the analysis of
individual components in the

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.009
mixture.
 

00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:15.519
So exposure during pregnancy
harms the fetus,

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:19.278
and synergistic effects exist
with radon,

00:32:19.278 --> 00:32:22.425
the natural gas that's given
off by granitic rock that we

00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:27.255
have here in Connecticut,
and the combination is known to

00:32:27.255 --> 00:32:29.250
cause lung cancer.
 

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:34.226
Environmental tobacco smoke has
increasingly become a target of

00:32:34.226 --> 00:32:35.269
regulation.
 

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:40.002
And its relationship to heart
disease is well supported by

00:32:40.002 --> 00:32:44.568
about thirteen epidemiological
studies, now fourteen.

00:32:44.568 --> 00:32:47.820
Environmental tobacco smoke is
responsible for other kinds of

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.880
effects that include heart
disease,

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.385
impairment of platelet
function, damage to the inside

00:32:53.385 --> 00:32:56.741
lining of arteries,
interference with oxygen

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.848
delivery and use by cells.
 

00:32:58.848 --> 00:33:03.201
And it can also depress
cellular respiration and enhance

00:33:03.201 --> 00:33:07.078
fatty deposits on vessel walls
that can exacerbate

00:33:07.078 --> 00:33:10.720
cardiovascular and neurological
illnesses.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.030
In 1997, a Harvard study of
thirty-two thousand nurses was

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.094
released,
and found that the relative

00:33:19.094 --> 00:33:23.559
risk of coronary heart disease
among those that smoked compared

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:26.368
to those that did not was about
two.

00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:29.056
So there was a two-fold
increase of risk of heart

00:33:29.056 --> 00:33:30.960
disease among those that smoked.
 

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.241
And they attributed sixty
thousand additional deaths each

00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:37.700
year in the United States to
environmental tobacco smoke.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.934
So that it wasn't until the
late 1990s that these estimates

00:33:41.934 --> 00:33:46.097
of health loss associated not
from smoking but being in an

00:33:46.097 --> 00:33:50.700
environment where others smoked
became quite sophisticated.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.092
A twenty-fold increase in death
from lung cancer was attributed

00:33:56.092 --> 00:34:01.396
to environmental tobacco smoke
as stated in EPA's 1992 Passive

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:03.048
Smoking Report.
 

00:34:03.048 --> 00:34:05.685
William Riley was the
administrator of the

00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:09.481
Environmental Protection Agency
at that point in time and he

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.340
also is a Yale graduate and
returns to Yale quite often.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.206
And I spoke to him about his
effort inside the Environmental

00:34:17.206 --> 00:34:20.943
Protection Agency in the early
1990s to have environmental

00:34:20.943 --> 00:34:24.746
tobacco smoke declared to be a
dangerous substance and more

00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:26.320
heavily regulated.
 

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.987
And he thought that that was
one of the most difficult fights

00:34:29.987 --> 00:34:33.289
that he had as administrator
during the early 1990s.

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:37.942
The chemicals found inside
tobacco smoke are all chemicals

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:41.860
that you'll recognize as
hazardous substances.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.309
Carbon monoxide,
nicotine, carcinogenic tars,

00:34:46.309 --> 00:34:48.880
ammonia, nitrogen dioxide,
vinyl chloride,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.510
cyanide, formaldehyde,
radionuclides,

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.980
benzene, nitrosamines,
aromatic hydrocarbons,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.730
benzoate, pyrene,
and arsenic,

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.110
all of these compounds are the
target of regulation under

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.440
different statues.
 

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.416
So it's quite remarkable that
we've been allowed to burn

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:08.018
cigarettes in indoor
environments.

00:35:08.018 --> 00:35:12.813
So why has indoor environmental
quality and this problem escaped

00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:17.000
the attention of the
Environmental Protection Agency?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.757
Well, it really has to do with
private property rights and the

00:35:20.757 --> 00:35:24.268
perception of being free from
government regulation inside

00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:26.980
your own home or inside your own
office.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.050
But it is quite curious.
 

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.851
The question about who should
pay for tobacco-related illness

00:35:32.851 --> 00:35:36.842
has prompted much more vigorous
regulatory action and really was

00:35:36.842 --> 00:35:40.581
the basis for David Kessler's
initiative inside the Food and

00:35:40.581 --> 00:35:44.320
Drug Administration that you
read about in his book,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.610
Question of Intent.
 

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.369
So in 1994 a new law was passed
authorizing the state of Florida

00:35:49.369 --> 00:35:53.009
to sue cigarette manufacturers
to recover their Medicaid funds

00:35:53.009 --> 00:35:56.590
used to treat people that had
tobacco-related illnesses.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.304
So states began to recognize
that their expenditures to pay

00:36:00.304 --> 00:36:02.610
for these illnesses were
enormous.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.829
They were in the multiple
billion dollars per year.

00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:10.711
The law was upheld by the
Florida Supreme Court and as of

00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.650
1997,
forty-one states banded

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.458
together to sue the tobacco
industry to recover these

00:36:15.458 --> 00:36:16.429
Medicaid costs.
 

00:36:16.429 --> 00:36:19.626
The state settlement,
as I mentioned earlier in the

00:36:19.626 --> 00:36:22.760
lecture, is estimated to be
about $250 billion.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.771
Additional private litigation
has also gone on in different

00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:31.230
states against different
corporations.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.195
States have also,
kind of interestingly,

00:36:33.195 --> 00:36:35.920
borrowed against their
anticipated tobacco payments.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.445
And many believe that states
have become addicted to the

00:36:40.445 --> 00:36:43.489
tobacco money produced as a
result.

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:48.384
So the EPA, in 1990,
began attacking passive smoking

00:36:48.384 --> 00:36:53.949
as being causally associated
with lung cancer in adults.

00:36:53.949 --> 00:36:57.583
And it listed environmental
tobacco smoke as a group A,

00:36:57.583 --> 00:37:00.409
or a "known human
carcinogen."

00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:02.871
You may think this is kind of a
modest difference in

00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:05.244
classification,
but there are relatively few

00:37:05.244 --> 00:37:08.360
known human carcinogens that are
recognized by the National

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.822
Cancer Institute,
the Centers for Disease

00:37:10.822 --> 00:37:14.239
Control, the International
Agency for Research on Cancer,

00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:16.789
and the World Health
Organization.

00:37:16.789 --> 00:37:19.914
So that the listing of the
product as a known human

00:37:19.914 --> 00:37:23.474
carcinogen gave the government
an increased step that they

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:27.376
could use to--
an increased and powerful lever

00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:32.842
that they could use to step up
their encouragement to prohibit

00:37:32.842 --> 00:37:37.860
tobacco products from being used
in public buildings.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.115
EPA estimated in 1992 that as
many as three thousand

00:37:41.115 --> 00:37:43.989
nonsmokers die from lung cancer
every year.

00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:50.480
There are different roles that
EPA has played.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.273
And if EPA has been responsible
for environmental tobacco smoke

00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:57.393
or second-hand smoke,
the FDA has been thought of as

00:37:57.393 --> 00:37:59.230
the target for regulation.
 

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.931
And that story is told,
I think very,

00:38:01.931 --> 00:38:04.110
very well by David Kessler.
 

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.710
So that FDA's question really
surrounded two issues.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:13.690
One, whether or not nicotine is
considered to be a drug,

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.309
because under the Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act,

00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:21.099
FDA eventually claimed
jurisdiction based upon its

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:24.518
finding that nicotine was a
drug.

00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:28.934
And if so, then it needed to
receive a license from the Food

00:38:28.934 --> 00:38:30.880
and Drug Administration.
 

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.347
And the second question is,
under the statute,

00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:38.818
is a cigarette itself or a
cigar a drug delivery device for

00:38:38.818 --> 00:38:39.820
the drug?
 

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.119
And if yes, it should be
regulated and possibly

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.670
prohibited under the statute.
 

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:49.199
So this question about
addiction is quite interesting.

00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:52.514
So if you look at a sales
weight in nicotine and tar

00:38:52.514 --> 00:38:58.742
levels in smoke,
back as early as 1982 you found

00:38:58.742 --> 00:39:08.730
that as a percentage of the 1992
level between '82 and 1991,

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:13.320
you find that the nicotine
levels in cigarettes increased.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.664
The tar levels went down,
predominately as a product of

00:39:16.664 --> 00:39:17.469
filtration.
 

00:39:17.469 --> 00:39:19.380
But something was going on.
 

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.860
And what was driving this
increase in nicotine?

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.960
In fact, curiously,
the amount of nicotine in light

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:32.369
brands that emerged during the
'80s and the 1990s,

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.800
were found to be higher than in
the regular brands.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.619
This didn't seem to make much
sense.

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:41.827
They also realized that if you
pluck the tobacco leaves higher

00:39:41.827 --> 00:39:45.068
up on the stalk,
that they had a higher nicotine

00:39:45.068 --> 00:39:47.690
content in some species of
plants.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.360
So that that meant that the
tobacco growers,

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.688
the tobacco processors,
had the capacity to manipulate

00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:59.509
the nicotine level based upon
the location on the stalk that

00:39:59.509 --> 00:40:01.960
the leaf was plucked from.
 

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.489
So the question again that
faced the Food and Drug

00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:08.659
Administration was,
isn't nicotine a drug?

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:11.818
And here's a comment from Sir
Charles Ellis,

00:40:11.818 --> 00:40:15.420
from the British American
Tobacco Company Research

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.110
Conference in 1962.
 

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.494
"It's my conviction that
nicotine is a very remarkable

00:40:20.494 --> 00:40:23.880
beneficent drug that both helps
the body to resist external

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.034
stress and also can,
as a result,

00:40:26.034 --> 00:40:28.349
show a pronounced tranquilizing
effect.

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:32.389
Nicotine is not only a very
fine drug (he continued),

00:40:32.389 --> 00:40:35.454
but the techniques of
administration by smoking has a

00:40:35.454 --> 00:40:38.873
considerable psychological
advantage and a built-in control

00:40:38.873 --> 00:40:40.820
against excessive absorption.
 

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.625
We are, then,
in the business of selling

00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:46.360
nicotine, an addictive
drug..."

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.342
By the way, these were comments
made at a private and

00:40:50.342 --> 00:40:54.936
confidential conference that
were eventually disclosed by the

00:40:54.936 --> 00:40:59.380
Food and Drug Administration in
its discovery process.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.329
And you can read more about
that and the role that Deep

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:09.739
Cough played in giving the Food
and Drug Administration,

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:12.773
and particularly Kessler,
guidance in how to get access

00:41:12.773 --> 00:41:16.369
to some of this information that
was not in the public domain.

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:19.532
He continued:
"We are of the conviction

00:41:19.532 --> 00:41:22.708
that the ultimate explanation
for the perpetuated cigarette

00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:25.501
habit resides in the
pharmacological effect of smoke

00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:27.199
upon the body of a smoker.
 

00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:30.481
Think of a cigarette pack as a
storage container for a day's

00:41:30.481 --> 00:41:33.875
supply of nicotine...think of
the cigarette as a dispenser for

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.599
a dosed unit of nicotine...
 

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:39.315
think of a puff of smoke as the
vehicle for nicotine...smoke is

00:41:39.315 --> 00:41:41.951
beyond question the most
optimized vehicle of

00:41:41.951 --> 00:41:43.210
nicotine..."
 

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.181
So going back to these original
transcripts of meetings held

00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:51.260
within the tobacco industry,
Kessler felt that he had

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.293
discovered yes,
they believed that this was a

00:41:54.293 --> 00:41:54.630
drug.
 

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.456
They believed that it was
addictive, and they were

00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:02.829
thinking themselves that the
cigarette and cigar wrappers

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:05.250
were drug delivery devices.
 

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.159
"In a sense,
the tobacco industry may be

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:10.989
thought of as a specialized,
highly ritualized,

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:13.550
and stylized segment of the
pharmaceutical industry."

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.130
Again, this is Claude Teague.
 

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.842
"Tobacco products uniquely
contain and deliver nicotine,

00:42:20.842 --> 00:42:23.626
a potent drug,
with a variety of physiological

00:42:23.626 --> 00:42:24.739
effects."
 

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:30.905
They also discovered that the
companies were engaged in plant

00:42:30.905 --> 00:42:34.005
breeding,
trying to genetically engineer

00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:37.739
strains of tobacco plants that
would produce higher levels of

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:41.083
nicotine,
particularly a strain known as

00:42:41.083 --> 00:42:43.110
the Y1 nicotine strain.
 

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:49.791
So the percentage of nicotine
in Y1 was about three-fold the

00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:54.210
content of normal flue-cured
tobacco.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.375
And the ammonia,
they found was capable of

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:01.543
liberating free nicotine from
the blend in which it was

00:43:01.543 --> 00:43:04.914
associated,
and it increased the impact of

00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:05.909
satisfaction.
 

00:43:05.909 --> 00:43:12.360
So adding ammonia as a chemical
component of the tobacco product

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.659
would increase the delivery of
nicotine.

00:43:16.659 --> 00:43:18.550
So I'm going to stop there.
 

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.760
We're just about at time.
 

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.739
And we'll come back to the more
recent revisions to law,

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:28.050
particularly the statute that
was adopted last June,

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.860
and signed by President Obama,
and compare that statute to the

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.295
Food and Drug Administration's
proposed regulations when

00:43:35.295 --> 00:43:37.920
Kessler was then the FDA
Commissioner.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.150
Thank you.
 

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:46.000

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.550
- Okay so today we're gonna talk about

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.320
the Israel-Palestine case that we made

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.120
at the School of Management.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.320
And this is in many ways complementary

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.300
to the South African
study that we talked about

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.003
earlier in the semester.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.823
- Distinguished participants,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.080
I would like to welcome very cordially

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.913
President Shimon Peres,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.833
President Mahmoud Abbas
and Secretary John Kerry.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.833
(audience applauds)

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.708
We want to share first with you,

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:57.370
with all of you in this hall and beyond

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.093
a call for action to break the impasse.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.250
This call for action
from all 300 key business

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.770
and societal leaders, from
both Israel and Palestine

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:18.600
representing large parts of the economy

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.210
is a powerful, and represents a powerful

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.210
mainstream constituency
to accelerate and support

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.473
the political process.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.680
- When I look back, I
see that most of my life,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.090
45 years was spent witnessing the conflict

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.920
between us and our neighbors.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.920
It is too much, too long, and too painful.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.270
There is almost not a single
Israeli or Palestinian family

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.950
that didn't pay a heavy and bitter price.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.950
Too many mothers in both
sides, shed too many tears.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.233
Enough!

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.490
During the entire last year,
a group of civic society

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.490
Palestinian and Israelis
worked closely together

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.360
trying to find a way in how they can help

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320
accelerate the talks towards creating

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920
two states for two people
living side-by-side

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.920
in dignity, peace, security,
justice, and prosperity.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.740
In the beginning, we were
few, but very quickly

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.593
many other joined.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.780
The group we have brought
together today in front of you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.550
consists of some of the
leading business people,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.300
top executives, academicians, security

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.740
and negotiation experts, and others.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.720
Partners who have come
from multitude of opinions

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.210
are from the left and the
right, secular and religious,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.320
with different views and
persuasions, however,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.680
we are all united by our strong desire

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.340
to see an end to the
conflict and move towards

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.893
a two-state solution.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.850
This will be a long road.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.380
We have to build trust among ourselves.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.610
We have to recognize that each
side has its own narratives

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.350
as to the reasons and the
backgrounds of the conflict.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.960
We knew that we are unable
to breach these narratives.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.230
So we decided to concentrate on focusing

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.760
on moving to a better future.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.410
We believe that this can be done.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.340
We are not here to submit a peace plan,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.860
this is the role of the leaders,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.190
and only they can do
the painful compromises

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.060
which will be needed in
order to move the process.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.610
But we are here to encourage them.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.070
We think that the civic
society has a role to play.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
Our voice should be heard, loud and clear.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.263
- Members of the business
community of Palestine,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.370
we are issuing an urgent call

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.250
to action, to all leaders
to break the impasse

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
and put as their top priority the serious

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and expedited pursuit of peace process.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.510
This process must end
with the establishment

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.280
in the short term, of an
independent Palestinian state

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.913
standing tall alongside
the state of Israel.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.303
As business leaders,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.750
responsible for over a
substantial amount of the GDP

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.020
of both Palestine and Israel,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.380
we have decided to take collective stand

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.150
and upset the status quo.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.130
Enough is enough.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.060
Break the impasse.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.630
We shall support you and
contribute in any way we can.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.630
We will not entertain joint
economic or commercial schemes

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.960
that would legitimize the status
quo, or illegal occupation.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.450
The time for choosing
which side of history

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.963
we wish to be on is now.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.480
- I want to thank those who took part,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.510
and are taking part, and
will continue to take part,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.610
in the Breaking the Impasse.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.550
My good friends Munib
Masri, whom I have known

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.610
and worked with, and been
to some of those private

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.310
and quiet meetings with
him in various places,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.470
and Yossi Vardi, thank you
both of you for stepping up

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.130
and being courageous.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.330
And even as they found
plenty to disagree on,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.950
I understand they did in the
course of their discussions,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.690
even as they fully understand
the difficult history

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.230
that is embedded in this conflict,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.230
they refuse to underestimate
the potential for the future.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.100
And that's because Breaking the Impasse's

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.150
guiding principle is
to respect the freedom

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.973
and the dignity of all peoples.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.600
- So that was the
official public launching

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.880
of Breaking the Impasse,
this group of some 300,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.630
eventually grew to closer to
500 Israeli and Palestinian

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.700
businesses that were
committed to trying to move

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.730
the peace process forward.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.260
And in some respects it was,
and certainly in the minds

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.360
of some its founders
it was loosely modeled

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.640
on the Consultative Business Movement

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.920
that had been so
consequential in facilitating

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.230
the South African
transition starting in 1988,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.220
that we talked about earlier.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.930
The first person you heard
there was Klaus Schwab,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.930
the founder and President
of the World Economic Forum.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.010
The second was Yossi Vardi,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.330
Israeli's wealthiest tech billionaire.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.280
The third was Munib al-Masri,
the wealthiest Palestinian,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.993
business leader, also a billionaire.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.183
And then finally of course John Kerry.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.220
Breaking the Impasse was wheeled out

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.220
with great fanfare and it was
also a spectacular failure,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.920
for reasons that will concern us.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.010
So lemme just spell
out what today's agenda

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.890
is going to be.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.760
First I wanna introduce
Nick Strong over here.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.083
Nick is a graduate of Yale College,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.560
major in Ethics Policy Economics,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.240
graduate of Yale College class of 2018.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.240
And he and I teamed up on this case.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.560
He took a course from me as a freshman

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.080
and we got to know each
other, one another early.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.910
And he, the truth be told,
is the real creative energy

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.910
behind the case that we wrote
with the SOM case writers

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.370
that we've made available for you today.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.240
And it explores a number of projects

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.910
that have been pursued by business

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.173
in the wake of the failure of BTI.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.770
And we're gonna focus on three of them.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.290
I would urge you to look at the ones

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.540
we're not gonna focus on
just for want of time.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.820
One is the Palestinian internship program,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.913
created by Yadin Kaufmann,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.080
through his company Sadara.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.890
And the other is a man Shlomi Fogel,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.890
who was the energy behind
the Jordan Gateway Project,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.960
an SEZ of the sort
Gustino was talking about

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.600
but that goes across the Jordan River,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.030
and is one of the few Israeli businessmen

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.700
doing business, collaborative
business with Palestinians

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.283
in Gaza today.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.240
All five of the projects,
those two and the three

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.800
we are gonna talk about, have the feature

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.200
that they get attacked,
both by the BDS movement,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.530
BDS standing for Boycott,
Divestment, and Sanctions.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.530
This is largely, initially
Palestinian-founded movement,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.430
officially launched in 2007
at a conference in Ramallah,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.843
but subsequently,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.250
I'm sorry, has antecedents going

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.250
really back to about 2001,
they all get attacked by BDS,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.630
and they also get attacked
by the Israeli right,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.100
on the same grounds.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.603
They get attacked for
normalizing the status quo.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.330
And neither the BDS people,
nor the Israeli right

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.163
wanna do that.

00:10:09.163 --> 00:10:11.900
We'll talk about that, and
indeed we'll also talk about

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.930
what normalizing might actually mean.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.730
But we'll do after we have
worked our way through

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.320
the cases that Nick is gonna end up

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.330
describing to you shortly, Nick welcome.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.330
(audience applauds)

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.900
So the agenda, the rest of the agenda.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.600
We're gonna be talking
about BTI and its failure.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.200
Then the subsequent business efforts

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.910
and that's when Nick will take over.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.550
And then what are the lessons learned.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.340
And what should we think,
both about the possibilities

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.783
and limits for business involved
in high-conflict political

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:00.210
possible transitions and
other more general lessons

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.230
that might be drawn.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.230
So what happened to BTI?

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.070
There was as you saw great
fanfare there on the Dead Sea,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.070
when it was launched
in the summer of 2013.

00:11:15.664 --> 00:11:18.493
It had actually been conceived
the year before in Davos.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.524
And then launched the following year.

00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:26.650
It was quickly walloped
the following summer,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.180
because that was the summer
that Israel went into Gaza

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.920
in 2014, in one of the
most highly conflictual

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.640
military confrontations between Israel

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.700
and the Palestinians in recent times.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.620
And that was then rapidly followed

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.620
by the March 2015 election
in which Netanyahu

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.620
did much better than anticipated,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.930
actually against a combined coalition

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.560
of the left of center parties,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.920
which didn't manage to stop him.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.870
And he formed a very
right-wing government,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.640
which was a harbinger of things to come.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.750
And so most of the people
who had been involved

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.840
in the BTI movement got pretty demoralized

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.780
and it didn't cease to exist,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.890
indeed it exists to this day.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.950
I went to one of their meetings

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.010
earlier this year in Jordan.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.230
But for all intents and
purposes it became moribund.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.180
Then we're gonna talk about
the subsequent evolution

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.763
of business efforts in
the wake of BTI's failure.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.180
Which is what Nick and I worked on

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.010
and what he is gonna discuss.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.890
But first let me just
draw out some contrasts

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.490
between BTI and our earlier discussion

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.383
of the Consultative Business
Movement in South Africa.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.940
And I should say right off the bat

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.633
that BTI's emergence surprised me.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.350
And the reason it surprised
was the following,

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.270
in the wake of learning how big a role

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.770
South African business
had played in the 1980s,

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.300
in facilitating conversations
between the government

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.520
and the ANC, I had gotten interested

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.180
in what business might be doing in other

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.830
high-conflicts settings,
in Northern Ireland,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.680
in the Middle East, and elsewhere.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.670
And so I actually went in 2006 and 2007,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.300
I went to Israel and the West Bank,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.730
and I interviewed a lot of
Israeli business leaders.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.300
And talked to them about
possible involvement

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.910
in the political process.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.440
And I interviewed some of the leaders

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.660
of Israel's biggest companies

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.830
and there wasn't a whiff of interest.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.990
They said what you would
expect them to say,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.840
they said, our business
is business not politics.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.610
The politicians wouldn't
listen to us anyway.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.960
And indeed when we lobby the government

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.390
it's usually about doing
cross-border deals in Jordan

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.260
and Egypt, you know, we have nothing to do

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.250
with the peace process.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.560
And I would say things like,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.150
well imagine if there was peace?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.100
You would have cheap Palestinian labor.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.880
You would have, you know
Gaza is on the Mediterranean.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.320
Think about the possibilities

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.500
if there were a real settlement.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.220
And to a person, no interest.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.980
We have cheap Russian
labor, was one answer I got

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.530
from a couple of people.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.770
So I concluded that for whatever reason

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.390
there was no Israeli business interest

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.670
involving themselves in
the political process.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.770
So I was very surprised
when in 2012 and 2013

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.573
I started learning about BTI.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.320
So business had not been interested.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.550
As you could see from that video,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.410
BTI, one difference between it

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.380
and the Consultative Business Movement,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.220
it was very much dreamed
up outside of the conflict

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.070
by people in Davos and it was
very much a top down movement.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.376
Whereas the Consultative
Business Movement,

00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:19.300
as I said to you when I gave
you my lecture about it,

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.103
really bubbled up and indeed was only,

00:15:24.146 --> 00:15:27.140
the CBM was only created when ANC leaders

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.870
got fed up with having
informal conversations

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.490
in people's living rooms

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.560
and said we want an
organization to talk to.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.500
So there was a much, even
though they were leaders

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.160
of large businesses, it
was much more bottom up

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.320
and generated from inside the conflict

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.340
than the BTI movement ever was.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.120
Another important
difference is, as you heard

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.120
from Yossi Vardi, and Munib
al-Masri, to a lesser extent,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.030
they both said we have all
political persuasions here

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.470
from the left to the
right, and we are not,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.210
we're not taking a position,

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.580
we're gonna be politically neutral,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.560
it's up to the politicians
to hammer it out.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.040
Well so one thing to say
is the position of BTI

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.250
was never neutral,
because the were committed

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.047
to a two-state solution.

00:16:23.047 --> 00:16:26.170
There are people on the
left and on the right,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.930
who have one-state solutions in mind,

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.950
very different one-state
solutions in mind,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.580
but nonetheless, one-state
solutions in mind.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.460
So while talking about
a two-state solution

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.270
as the politically-neutral answer,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.312
in fact they were not politically neutral

00:16:47.312 --> 00:16:51.890
and were committed to
a two-state solution.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.843
And one thing to say is, if you spend,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.220
and Nick will have more to say about this,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.123
but if you spend any
time in the West Bank,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.400
it doesn't take you long to realize

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.680
that the probability that Israel

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.030
is going to leave the West Bank

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.030
is somewhere in the
range of the probability

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.440
that the federal government is gonna agree

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.750
to give North Dakota back
to the Sioux Indians.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.750
It is so far beyond the realm
of what is feasible or likely

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.920
in the next several
decades, that for everybody

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.900
to keep saying, repeating this mantra,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.583
that we're all committed
to this two-state solution,

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.140
tells you that a lot of people

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.660
are pretty disconnected from reality.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.660
Another difference with the
Consultative Business Movement

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.780
was the resolute refusal
of anyone involved in BTI

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.410
to talk to Hamas.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.540
This would have been the equivalent

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.300
of the Consultative
Business Movement saying

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.940
we're not talking to the ANC,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.350
we're only gonna talk to Inkatha.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.690
And indeed in December of
2013, I went to a meeting

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.810
of the CBM, of the BTI in Washington, D.C.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.133
and I interviewed both
Vardi and Munib al-Masri.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.860
And we then had this big forum,
there were 200 people there,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.360
and they made speeches,
similar to the speeches

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.700
you saw there.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.390
And then there were questions.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.950
And I asked a question, I said, you know,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.320
it was sort of about the
elephant in the room,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.640
I said, nobody is talking,
nobody has mentioned Hamas.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.150
What do you think about Hamas?

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.720
And they politely, but
definitely, unambiguously,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.430
completely ignored my question.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.000
They didn't answer it at all.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.797
They didn't even go through
the motions of answering it.

00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:01.730
It was as though I hadn't spoken.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:06.730
And so again, one of the
key potential veto players,

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.350
on any possible settlement,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.310
was not at the table, even implicitly.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.630
Then they also lacked a K-Group.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.427
They indeed trumpeted the
fact that they were 300,

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:25.890
and eventually closer to
500 businesses involved,

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.680
but even in the smaller meetings of BTI,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.340
where there were 15 to 20
businesses represented,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.120
people you interviewed
there would tell you

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.510
that there was never any
agreement on what it was

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.430
that they should actually be trying to do.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:47.430
And there was not any
equivalent of Mike Spicer's

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.690
declaration to me that in
South Africa in the 1980s,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.870
you could get nine people around a table

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.720
and it was the whole economy.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.330
So there was no K-Group,
and therefore no capacity

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.270
to turn this movement into
something that could pursue

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.113
a goal in a disciplined way.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.600
Again the refusal to get involved

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.320
in the negotiation
themselves, a big difference

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.810
from the Consultative Business Movement,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.940
where the leaders of the
movement rolled up their sleeves,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.820
started themselves talking to members

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.550
of the liberation movement,
committed themselves

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.530
to majority-rule democracy,
long before any politician

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:35.304
was doing that, and so showed themselves,

00:20:35.304 --> 00:20:38.210
as the way I put it in the
lecture, showed themselves

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.070
as willing to internalize
some of the costs

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.800
of achieving a transition.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.480
And none of these business
leaders was really doing that.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.370
They were simply running
ads and making speeches,

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.370
telling the politicians
to make settlements.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.010
Almost no effort to
build grassroots support,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.440
was a corollary of that.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.870
And one symptom of it is, if
you look at the BTI website

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.150
it's in two languages, what
are they, they're in Hebrew

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.700
and in English.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.030
There's no Arabic on the website.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.440
Again, just not so subtle
signal that there was

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.780
not much tactical, never
mind strategic thinking

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.193
about building grassroots
support for the new order.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.000
And indeed, as

00:21:32.281 --> 00:21:36.150
Yossi Vardi said in the
clip that I showed you,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.670
they had actually they
thought made a smart decision.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.340
They said we have these
conflicting narratives

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.970
about the past, and we don't
agree on what they are,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.100
and we've decided to stop talking about

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.303
our conflicting narratives
and simply move forward.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.460
But of course, if you wanna
move forward without confronting

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.460
the conflicting narratives at all,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.100
that puts a different
question on the table,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.810
namely how to build
support for the new order

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.550
that you're trying to construct,

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.750
among populations that
are deeply wedded to

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.760
these conflicting narratives.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.760
So the short answer to this
is that the failure of BTI

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.043
was heavily overdetermined.

00:22:23.043 --> 00:22:27.333
I think it was not well
conceived and not well executed.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.610
But in the wake of the failure, first I,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.460
and then Nick and I, got
interested in what some

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.420
of the principles behind
this were doing, instead.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.120
And that's what he's spent

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.366
much of his undergraduate career doing,

00:22:45.366 --> 00:22:48.170
and then as I said, he was the main energy

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.943
behind the case that we
wrote, so over to Nick.

00:22:52.874 --> 00:22:55.874
(audience applauds)

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.100
- Hi everyone.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.980
Thanks so much for having
me on this rainy Thursday,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.390
and also for making your way over to SSF,

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.820
which I remember fondly as an undergrad.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.140
So I think the place to begin

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.950
is a little post-mortem on BTI.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.950
So we began by hearing the
actual start of the movement,

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.110
of the organization at the WEF in 2013.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:31.490
And now, we can look at
some footage that we shot,

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.980
during the summer of 2018,
of those same principles

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.530
of Vardi, of al-Masri,
discussing what happened

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.810
and what went wrong in BTI.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.840
I want you all to focus on this too,

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.377
what different narratives
come out of this?

00:23:46.377 --> 00:23:50.030
The Israeli narrative, Vardi talks about,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.067
the Palestinian narrative
that al-Masri talks about,

00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:56.010
and the differences in
how that informs perhaps

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.290
some of the troubles that
have plagued the organization

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.547
from the beginning.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.850
- I think first of all, that
the voice that we should

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.733
have a two-state solution,

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.293
and the voice that the business
community will support,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.700
or at least parts, or big
parts of the business community

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.160
will support the government in doing it.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.160
It's a very important input
in the future equation.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.970
We should continue to meet.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.970
- I believe in having the
political solution first.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.150
I would never cooperate in any way

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.560
after my experience with the Israelis.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.470
After experience with
the 500 business people,

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.920
the Israelis who said yes they
wanted two-state solution,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.770
they wanted to do this,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.060
and when it came, when they
WEF, the World Economic Forum,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.470
tried to do something they vanished.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.910
- We felt that the
Israeli business community

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.320
was not what we were
thinking that they would be,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.680
in terms of being aggressive

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.400
and push the political
leadership to come in line

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.530
with what they were privately saying.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.183
- These days it's not very
popular to be a peacemaker.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.210
Not in the Israeli side,
not in the Palestinian side.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.890
It's not very popular nowadays.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.210
There's no negotiation today
and it's not very popular

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:33.210
because the society
doesn't support people that

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.850
believe in negotiation and peace.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.770
The same happens in the Palestinian side.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:44.960
Maybe even more.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.420
- And to be frank, the
failure came mostly after

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.823
the war on Gaza in 2014.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.180
During the war, when you
have suffering of people

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.110
for 50, 55 days, and
you don't hear a voice

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.160
coming from Israel, trying to,
or asking to stop that war,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.260
or to stop that part of
grievance that we have,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.290
we thought that it seems
all that we have done

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.340
does not have a good
sound on the other side.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.940
They could not manage to say
something publicly against.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.270
And we felt alone.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.910
- In the minds of all
Palestinians it's dead.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.440
In the minds of the Israelis
they want to keep it this way

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.363
for their own benefit, to create,

00:26:30.612 --> 00:26:32.270
to say that we are working.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.080
We're doing something
with the Palestinians.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.280
But to me it's completely dead.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.080
- If you go down the street
here, you ask any Palestinian

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.450
what do you think, one-state, two-state,

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.970
they'll tell you look, we take one state,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.723
we have one condition only,

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.493
equal rights.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.350
- So very different in 2018
from the initial excitement

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.400
about the organization in 2013.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.260
I think there's a lotta
things that jump out.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.170
But to me, the most
important part is you have

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.810
the Palestinian leadership saying

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.240
that this organization no longer exists

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.640
and then you're also interviewing a CEO

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.090
of the same organization,
which is moving forward

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.400
and still holding events.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.090
I think that dovetails into
just a very brief history

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.480
of the conflict.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.460
And what I want everyone to think about

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.457
in terms of narratives, as
we think about this conflict

00:27:31.457 --> 00:27:33.657
and the business that's
operating within it,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.500
so much ink has been spilled
on the history of the conflict.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.870
There's plenty of wonderful courses

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.350
that you can take here at Yale on it.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.710
So our mission today isn't
to actually understand

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.860
the conflict, to determine
what events took place

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.803
to shape it, but more to
be comfortable in the fact,

00:27:53.803 --> 00:27:56.733
that there are multiple
narratives within it.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.700
If you read the case, I begin
the history of the conflict

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.700
with the first massive wave
of European Jewish immigration

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.120
to what is now Israel in the late 1900's,

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.100
rather 19th century.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.080
If you talk to some, they would define

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.700
the start of this conflict of this story,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.430
particularly religious, or far-right Jews,

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.560
as going back to the times
of the Old Testament.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.240
For Palestinians it could
be during the 17th century,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.330
where there were efforts to gain autonomy

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.890
from the Ottoman Empire.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.690
So our goal here is not
to establish the history,

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.807
but to recognize that there
are multiple narratives,

00:28:35.807 --> 00:28:38.690
and that multiple narratives can be true.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.210
I've two images up here
to show this conflict,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.160
or this contrast.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.580
On one hand, you see the separation wall.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.950
It is two different people.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.050
A separation wall, a security border,

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.083
and an apartheid wall.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.670
Also on the left, you see
not only is there a conflict

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.810
of separation that you see in the barrier,

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.810
but there's also one of
co-existence and of proximity.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.700
This is in the east of Jerusalem.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.700
You see an ultra-Orthodox family,
passing Palestinian Arabs.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.763
So I want everyone to get
comfortable with the fact

00:29:17.763 --> 00:29:21.210
that when we think about
the principles in the case

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.060
we'll be discussing and how they operate

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.115
that there isn't a single narrative

00:29:25.115 --> 00:29:28.700
that defines the conflict itself.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.160
I think everyone subscribes
to different narratives.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.070
And one of the challenges that they face,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.570
and anyone I think in a
conflict zone like this faces

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.120
is actually understanding that
there's multiple narratives.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.477
That what you're operating

00:29:41.477 --> 00:29:43.470
and the assumptions that you're taking

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.373
are not necessarily universal.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.150
So jumping back, Professor
Shapiro discussed

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.850
the two-state solutions
and the facts on the ground

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.050
that now make it quite
difficult to imagine

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.370
that it will take hold any
time in the near future,

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.500
but if you've been following

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.090
contemporary Israeli politics at all,

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.530
you know that this has
perhaps become more and more

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.110
moribund in the last few months.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.170
So the left in Israel, the Labor Party,

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.750
which had been the traditional left,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.150
has effectively dried up as a major force.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.950
It's now Likud on the right,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.410
and then a more centrist
party Blue and White,

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.850
under Benny Gantz.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.380
And as you saw in the spring,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.210
when there was this first
period of campaigning

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.130
and now they're going
through renewed cycles

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.270
of trying to form a
government, Likud especially

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.560
under Netanyahu was
pushing facts on the ground

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.330
increasingly away from
a two-state solution,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.420
openly discussing annexing the West Bank.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.340
And further, there wasn't a left left,

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.630
or even a center party that was providing

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.280
a viable alternative.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.690
So one of the things that
I think we need to discuss

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:00.760
and think about BTI, is where do you move

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.700
if you're operating in this conflict,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.350
if what's been the dogma for it,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.400
since really the beginning
of two-state solution,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.317
and that's both in Israel,
among Fatah and the Palestinians

00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:13.940
and in the U.S. too.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.670
Congress right now is
discussing passing a resolution

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.760
affirming its support for
the two-state solution.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.400
If you're moving away from that,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.500
if the status quo is changing,

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.930
then how do you actually operate?

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.053
Where are you moving towards?

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.200
The economic realities of today

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.850
are really one of separation.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.810
Israel, if you've kept
up with their economy,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.700
is truly a technology powerhouse.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.030
Start-up nation is used
colloquially often to describe it.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.660
But it's one of the leading

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.480
technologically-advanced
countries in the world.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.283
In terms of startups per capita,
it is the world's leader.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.270
The Palestinian territories,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.670
so speaking about the West Bank and Gaza,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.180
are diverging, but also far behind.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.910
Though after the Oslo Accords,

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.700
there's a bit of an uptick
in the economic fortunes

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.533
of the West Bank.

00:32:07.533 --> 00:32:10.720
Increasingly, this has become
more and more difficult,

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.037
as intifadas have created conditions,

00:32:13.037 --> 00:32:16.530
and you're seeing above a
shot on a street in Hebron,

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.470
a wall separating a Jewish portion

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.640
from a Palestinian portion.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.670
Destruction of capital, the
difficulty of moving goods,

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.360
and this is particularly true in Gaza.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.830
The economic situation in the West Bank,

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.740
though nowhere approximating
that of Israel,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.940
is still far more advanced than Gaza,

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.510
which has been under
blockade for some years now.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.400
But I think the second point to make,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.370
is there's always going to be

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.410
a sense of intractability
in the conflict too,

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.210
even as you have this
divergence economically.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:50.590
Israel's a very different place,

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.030
if you think about its
economy from Palestine,

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.840
because of the geography of the conflict,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.040
because of contours of
demographics, of shared history,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.190
there's always going to be
this element of shared fate.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.850
And I put this photo up,
which at first glance

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.280
looks like a standard Israeli beach,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.160
overlooking the Mediterranean,
to make that very fact.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.510
So if you went through the case,

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.810
you'll know that what
we're looking at here

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.330
is a beach just south of the
Israeli city of Ashkelon,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.490
looking south to Gaza City.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.640
It's quite interesting to go to this beach

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.210
because while it's well
within range of rocket fire,

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.330
during periods of conflict,
it's quite popular

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:35.120
among local Israelis to go to the beach.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.480
But perhaps more importantly to us,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.040
when we think about the
interconnectedness of geography,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.870
is just north of this beach

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.070
is the Ashkelon desalination plant.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.270
So Israel in a part of the region

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.000
that is quite water scarce,
has turned towards desalination

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.050
as a way to get much
of its water capacity.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.810
And it was found out that
there's a period in recent years,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.880
where the Ashkelon desalination plant

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.260
had to be closed because of raw sewage

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.860
being let out in Gaza due
to issues processing it

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.600
with lack of electricity,
capital infrastructure et cetera,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.010
had been dumping raw sewage
into the Mediterranean,

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.470
flowing up to Israel and shutting down

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.500
the desalination plant.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.210
And all this is to say,

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.400
that even as you have this divergence,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.513
even as you try to establish
a status quo of separation,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.880
even as you try to kick
the can down the road

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.780
and pass the buck on what a solution is,

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.120
there's always going to
be this intractability.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.530
And I think that's something
we're going to continue seeing

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.930
as we discuss the different case examples.

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:41.260
Now let's talk very
briefly about geography.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.853
Who here has been to
Israel or the West Bank?

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.180
Any impressions on its size
when traveling through it?

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.781
You can just shout it out.

00:34:51.781 --> 00:34:52.614
- [Man] Small.

00:34:52.614 --> 00:34:55.540
- Small, it's about
the size of New Jersey.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.500
At its narrowest point
it's about 15k across.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.160
And you can see, that part of that means,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.110
that even if you don't have
the two-state solution,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.530
if you have a separation
of the Palestinians,

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.120
of the Israelis, that
there is shared fortune

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.060
just by nature of the geography.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.050
And the geography is quite contested.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.660
You can have a situation
like we see in Gaza,

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.880
where you have a blockade.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.510
Where you have Israel
totally removing itself

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:28.000
from connections to Gaza and
yet because of the environment,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.350
because of the closeness of the geography

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:34.400
there's still has to
necessarily be connections.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.750
And again, geography is so important

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.690
to understanding this conflict.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.480
You think about the West Bank there.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.020
Right now we're using
a United Nations map,

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.870
but the borders that are
drawn here are very much ones

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:48.300
that are understand contest.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.940
Similarly, if we think about

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.030
what to even call the West Bank.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.360
There's huge contest
about what that would be.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.600
There would be those that
would call it the West Bank,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.790
those that would call it
the state of Palestine

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.900
and those who would call
it Judea and Samaria.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.630
So again, when we think
about contested geography,

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.550
when we think about different narratives,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.460
there's the fact that all of these folks,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.580
all these principals,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.010
are operating with very
different assumptions

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.013
in a very confined space.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.760
Now, I think the central question

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.200
we're all going to
consider together today,

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.150
is what can business do, so what can BTI

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.300
and similar folks do, when
the political process fails?

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.860
And to begin, let's go quickly
through the major peace talks

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.360
for the Israel and Palestine conflict

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.363
in the last 25 or so years.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.390
So beginning in 1991, the lead up to Oslo,

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.933
you had the Madrid
conference, you had Oslo 1,

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.240
Oslo 2, the Hebron Protocol,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.860
the Wye River Memorandum,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.263
the Sharm el-Sheik Memorandum,
the Camp David Summit,

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.860
the Taba Summit, the Annapolis Conference,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.473
you then had Senator George
Mitchell leading talks,

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.487
the John Kerry-led talks,
which dovetails into BTI,

00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:13.700
and what you saw at the
start of class today,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.080
and then 2019,

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.130
or coming sometime soon,

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.933
the Kushner Peace talks.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.300
And think I've had this
slide for a couple years now

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.930
and I was telling Professor Shapiro,

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.080
every time I do this talk
I have to update that date.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.530
But hopefully sometime in the near future

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.200
we'll hear about the Kushner Peace Plan.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.200
But I think the takeaway here
is what's the actual progress

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.630
towards any solution,
and it's nearly none.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.810
So if you're a business looking at this,

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.230
despite all the efforts, all the talks

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.260
and expend by the Arab League,
the belligerents themselves,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.380
the U.S., Russia has been
involved in the quartet,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.980
where do you actually go from here,

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.873
when the political process
fails and is stagnant?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.120
So I think there's three
options for the private sector.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.950
And for the next portion of the lecture,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.200
I want everyone to imagine
themselves as a business person

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.770
in Israel, in Palestine, facing this

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.710
stagnant political
process, and thinking about

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.140
what options you have available

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.120
if you wanna move things along?

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.580
And the three I'm gonna layout is, one,

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.350
and this I think fits
into BTI's approach is,

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.300
you can revive, or influence
the former political process.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.420
So you can, like BTI,
say we are gonna take

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.610
our collective influence
in the business community,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.230
we have 30% of the GDP, and
we're gonna pressure politicians

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.220
on both sides to re-engage
in the political process.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.970
We're not going to actually shape it,

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.910
we're not gonna say what a
solution's gonna look like,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.440
but we're gonna be a pressure group

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.840
that makes our politicians
move forward with it.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.340
The second, and we'll see
some examples of this,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.110
though I think it becomes quite fraught,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.890
is you can act completely independently

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.920
of the political process.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.810
So you can say that the status
quo is not moving anywhere

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.323
from the political process.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.010
Talks aren't doing anything,
there's no discussion.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.860
So what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.590
change facts on the ground myself.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.950
I'm gonna remove myself
from the political process,

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.770
and I'm gonna act independently of it,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.040
and I'm gonna change the actual facts

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.633
by using my influence
as the private sector.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:25.300
And then the third, and I
think the one that you'll see

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.310
most of the cases we discussed aligned to

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.180
because of the nature of the conflict,

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.100
is you act both within and
without the political process.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.920
Fundamentally what I mean by that is

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.440
you cant's wring the
politics outta politics,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.610
particularly in a high-conflict zone

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.270
like Israel and Palestine,
even when you are trying

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.510
to act independently of
the political process.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.340
And we'll see this more
as we go through the case.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.670
You are necessarily being
political in doing so.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.890
Even the act of operating
outside the political process

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.383
is political, and quickly
becomes political.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.610
So there's three main principles
I wanna talk about today.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.450
And you likely saw them in the case.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:09.970
They are SodaStream,
Rawabi City, and then also

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.910
EcoPeace Middle East, all
of which are very different,

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.690
but also I want everyone to consider,

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.800
and we'll discuss at the end,
what are the common threads,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.850
we have one of them,
which is the challenge

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:25.330
both from the left and the
right to their progress.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.070
But consider, what are
the similar challenges,

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.450
the similar narratives,
perspectives, shared by all these?

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.563
So we'll begin with
SodaStream and a quick video.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.127
- [Reporter] Here's one
commercial millions saw

00:40:36.127 --> 00:40:37.530
during the Super Bowl.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.300
- Mix in the perfect flavor.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.140
Look, soda that's better
for you and all of us.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.410
- [Reporter] Johansson endorses SodaStream

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:47.980
and for years served as
a spokesperson for Oxfam,

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.420
a group fighting global poverty.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.790
But Oxfam recently told Johansson,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.960
her work with SodaStream was incompatible,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.570
because it operates a
factory in what they call,

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.730
the occupied West Bank.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.170
- This is the plant at the
heart of the controversy.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.730
It's about a 20-minute
drive outside of Jerusalem

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.020
and it's become the target
of the BDS movement.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.030
BDS means boycott,
divestment, and sanctions.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.980
The factory employs 13 hundred workers,

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.660
500 of them are Palestinian.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.980
Some in the BDS movement
and groups like Oxfam

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.492
would like to shut the factory down.

00:41:24.492 --> 00:41:28.150
SodaStream's CEO says they
should come to his factory.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.930
- I say they should come here
and look my workers in the eye

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.270
and then tell me that they
wanna close the factory.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.320
'Cause you know, it's easy
to wanna close the factory

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.690
when you're sitting behind
a Oxfam desk in New York,

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.420
or wherever they sit, and
claim that we are the ones

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.540
who are hurting human rights.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.930
- [Reporter] Oxfam claims,
businesses such as SodaStream,

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.370
further the on-going poverty
of the Palestinian communities

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.210
that we work to support.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.830
Yet SodaStream workers, who
make three to four times

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.480
what other Palestinians
make in the West Bank,

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.330
tell a different story.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.660
- We love SodaStream.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.950
We need SodaStream.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.473
Where do we go after this job?

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.440
- Anyone have a SodaStream at home?

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:15.470
So SodaStream is a unique
company, in that today

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.850
if you go to the Negev in southern Israel

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.020
and walk into their factory,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.250
you will see a scene similar to this,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.770
which was taken the summer of 2018.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.820
Which is Israelis and
Palestinians working together

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.800
on a factory line.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.780
And what I'll add in there,
it's not just Israeli workers

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.090
supervising Palestinian labor.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.070
There are Palestinian foremen and managers

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.560
on the SodaStream factory
floor, which is quite unique

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.540
within the conflict and within the region.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.120
Now how did we get to
this place of SodaStream,

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.900
which Daniel Birnbaum who you
saw at the end of the clip,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.720
and factors heavily into the case,

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.580
refers to as an island of
peace within the conflict.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.790
An example of cooperation
between Israelis and Palestinians

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.070
coming together in business

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.940
to change the facts on the ground

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.870
and change narratives around cooperation.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.720
It began with I think, much lower sights.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.140
So SodaStream, and you
saw a clip from 2013,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.463
of when that factory was
originally in the West Bank,

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.940
began hiring Palestinians
because of a lack of labor.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.170
It wasn't a principled move.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.070
Daniel Birnbaum, when he became CEO,

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:29.450
needed additional labor to
deal with growing demand,

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.780
and hired Palestinians.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.220
Very quickly though, I think he realized

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.550
that there was something there.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:40.500
That Israelis and Palestinians
could work together.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.712
There were of course challenges.

00:43:43.712 --> 00:43:48.020
Some Israeli employees initially
quit the West Bank factory

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.560
when Palestinians were introduced.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.490
And you had challenges, coming
both from the left and right,

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.290
to this experiment.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:58.560
So SodaStream moved from something

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.150
that was originally using
Palestinians as additional labor,

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.530
into them becoming an
important part of the company,

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.200
serving as foremen, as floor managers,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.700
getting full health benefits,
commensurate of that provided

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.563
by the Israeli state system.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.120
But as soon as that began, and soon after,

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.490
as you saw in that clip,
there were challenges

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.660
from both the left and the right.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.340
On the left as you saw was BDS,

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.300
which looked at something like SodaStream

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.330
as normalizing the status quo.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.810
As employing Palestinians,
but not actually making

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:39.120
any fundamental changes
to the political situation

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.953
on the ground.

00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:42.350
And what it was doing, by
operating in the West Bank,

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.960
was just normalizing an occupation.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.210
And this was something that
was heavy enough in pressure,

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.420
that depending on who you
believe in the decision making,

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.740
but something that I lean
towards, was a significant factor

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.650
in SodaStream leaving
the West Bank altogether.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.360
The second was on the Israeli right,

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.060
which saw Israelis and
Palestinians working together,

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:09.210
as fundamentally challenging
the narrative of the conflict.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.380
So very interestingly it
was even once SodaStream

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.830
left the West Bank, for
a new factory in Israel,

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:17.910
they brought their
Palestinian workers with them.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.640
They worked with the Israeli government

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.890
to get work permits to bring
the Palestinian workers

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.370
along with with them to the Negev.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.030
So I think there's two reasons for this.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:31.690
One is they were fundamental
to the production process.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.470
They were skilled labor.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.960
They were in management positions.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.460
And two because Daniel
Birnbaum had begun to see

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.930
this cooperation as something

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.310
that could actually be
influencing consumers.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.750
If you have a SodaStream now,

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.890
and you look on the back
of the box it comes in,

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.880
you'll see that it says,
produced by Arabs, and Jews,

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.690
and Israelis, working
together in peace and harmony.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.570
So again, it was a way to
actually change the narrative

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.520
around the conflict.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.197
But, when I first started
getting involved in SodaStream,

00:46:04.197 --> 00:46:09.197
and this is in 2016, they had
just had their last employees

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.480
in the Israeli factory,

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.620
the last Palestinian employees,
lose their work permits.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.610
And there's this question,
and Birnbaum became

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.100
a very outspoken critic

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.730
of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu over this,

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.030
about these permits being canceled.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.040
If you ask Birnbaum, the
reason they were canceled,

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.860
was because for the right,
for those who were not looking

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.430
to change the political status quo,

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.530
not looking for cooperation,
it represented a threat

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:37.363
to that narrative.

00:46:37.363 --> 00:46:40.800
So the Palestinian
workers were reinstated,

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.940
in waves after a heavy pressure
campaign by SodaStream,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:48.940
but it showed that it was a
capricious solution at best,

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.700
both on the left, BDS, who
still criticizes SodaStream.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.320
And there are several Nordic countries,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.520
before this factory was
moved, that wouldn't accept

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.320
SodaStream products made in the West Bank.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.090
They had to outsource it to China.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.320
But also on the right, if you look at

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.450
Prime Minister Netanyahu
and the idea that,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.430
well why would we bring Palestinian labor

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.210
into Israel when we have
the unemployed in Israel

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.073
continues to be a challenge to it.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.350
But I think what you see from
the example of SodaStream

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:28.310
is the ability to influence the status quo

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.080
on a grassroots level.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.710
You're able to build business

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.580
and people-to-people connections

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.230
that actually change the outlook.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.870
And it's quite interesting,

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:38.450
and there's some quotes in the case,

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.750
about if you speak to folks, both Israeli

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.470
and Palestinian who work at SodaStream,

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.210
to hear how their outlook on the conflict,

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.340
and on the other side the other,

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.750
changes by actually working together.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.160
Having Palestinians manage Israelis,

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.710
Israelis manage
Palestinians, and as you see,

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.763
sit together on the factory
line for hours every day.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.040
So this, I think if you look
at it, Birnbaum would say,

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.990
he's trying to operate outside
of the political process.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.280
This is about business.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.440
This is about what he thinks is right.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.620
But if we think about the realities,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.840
it is inherently political,
because you are challenging

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.230
the facts on the ground.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.907
And I think both the reaction
of the left, with BDS,

00:48:17.907 --> 00:48:20.850
and the right, with work
permits being canceled

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:23.470
and this being challenges
bringing Palestinians

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:26.420
into Israel, show exactly that.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.150
SodaStream today, continues
to operate in this way,

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.100
but has to inherently be
political to renew work permits.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.310
It needs to lobby the Israeli government

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:40.010
and it further needs to
lobby those aligned with BDS

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.320
to show that what they
are doing is not actually

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.040
normalizing an occupation.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.580
And it shows, even examples like this,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.930
which you would think is straightforward,

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.460
you have Israelis and
Palestinians working together,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.920
it can become very fraught,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.423
and very political, very quickly.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.580
And adding to the complication recently,

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.950
I believe the summer of 2018,
SodaStream was sold to Pepsi.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.770
So they are now a subsidiary of Pepsi

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.260
and it leads the question, at what point

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.800
do the needs of a business
trump whatever social good

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.960
it's trying to promote,
or social mission it has.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.000
So, so far, SodaStream's
kept up with the model

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.210
of having Israelis and
Palestinians together.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.270
But the question remains of,
will Pepsi have the stomach

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.353
to continue that in the long run?

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.350
The next I wanna jump into is Rawabi City.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.440
And Rawabi City, and we'll
hear from Bashar al-Masri,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.670
who's actually the nephew
of Munib al-Masri, shortly.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.860
But Rawabi City is the first
planned city in Palestine,

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.673
and in the West Bank specifically.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.560
The most significant construction project

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.640
in terms of scale, that's
really ever been undertaken

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.533
in the West Bank.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.200
- I feel more of a politician sometimes

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.880
than a business person.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.550
Politics is all over us,
you cannot take the politics

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.300
out of the Palestinian lives,
not just business people.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.203
With Rawabi it was
difficult for the Israeli,

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:18.140
that Israeli propaganda,
the negative propaganda,

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.910
to paint Rawabi they way they paint

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.383
the whole Palestinian situation.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.260
One of the most important issues of Rawabi

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.720
is the Palestinians' feeling of pride,

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.570
that yes we can take
matters with our own hand,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.490
despite the fact that
we're under occupation,

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.400
we don't have to give in to
the occupation and leave.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.830
We can defy the occupation
and build on our land.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.240
Of course it's also a great message

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.270
to the international community

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.820
that we are sophisticated people.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:56.820
We're not just as we are
perceived the terrorists

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:59.560
and the victims.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.780
We are the victims that's for sure,

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:06.010
but we're not simply
terrorists, we're just people

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:07.940
who are fighting for our rights.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:12.730
And now we are working
hard to build our nation.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:17.620
140,000 Palestinian workers
every day cross into Israel,

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.580
to work in Israel.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.840
Are they normalizers?

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.790
Of course they are.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:23.003
Do they have a choice?

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.780
They have a choice of being
unemployed definitely.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.120
And what I'm doing with normalizing

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.710
is I'm creating credible
jobs for these people,

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.520
so they're not humiliated.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.850
They're getting salaries, higher salaries.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.110
They're getting their rights.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.320
And IT professional does not need to work

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.350
as a gardener, or as a laborer in Israel,

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:46.570
when they can work here as a programmer,

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.163
which is what they studied to be.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.853
The ultimate evil is
the settlers of course.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.050
And then the occupation,
which is the cover

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:57.930
for the settlers.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.450
We don't have issues with
the ordinary Israeli people.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:06.450
The settlement movement is
an ideological movement.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:09.750
In the core of it, we
should not exist here

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.363
and they should be on this land.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.490
Ironically, we found it was
Israelis and pro-Israelis

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.230
that lobbied our case.

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:24.660
The water crisis was resolved
by pro-Israeli groups

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.200
and Israeli groups, and
some even Israeli officials,

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.040
including the late President of Israel,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.100
who was calling his Prime
Minister and his Defense Minister

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.260
and say, why aren't you
giving water to this city?

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.810
So perhaps you could see
this as an alternative way

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.810
of struggle and to reaching your rights.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.230
- So if SodaStream was
meant to be incremental

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.630
in changing the facts on the ground,

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.490
by bringing Israelis and
Palestinians together,

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:59.220
and promoting understanding.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.440
Rawabi was meant to shift
the status quo altogether.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.570
As you can see, this
is a picture of Rawabi,

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.010
taken during construction.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.820
It's a massive endeavor.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.820
It's meant to be a planned
community for 40,000 residents.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.540
Schools, hospitals, and also

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.288
employment opportunities all within.

00:53:20.288 --> 00:53:22.670
And if we think about the three options

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.460
that we discussed at the beginning

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.090
available to the private sector,

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.150
Bashar al-Masri basically
looked at them and said,

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.320
well what I'm going to do
is totally remove myself

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.590
from a flawed political process.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:38.650
I'm going to build on
land that is in area A.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.880
So if we think about Israeli
territory in the West Bank,

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.940
there's area C, which is
administered by Israel.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:51.940
There's area B, which has
security oversight by Israel.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.190
And then area A, which is

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:56.590
completely under Palestinian authority.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.530
And he said, to remove myself
from the political process,

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:01.800
I'm gonna build only in area A.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.470
And what I'm going to
do is create a community

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:08.830
that changes the status
quo on a couple levels.

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:13.830
One is I'm going to change the
economics of the West Bank.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:18.970
Right now we have 3,000
university graduates per year

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.530
in the technology fields and we're unable

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.990
to sufficiently get jobs for all of them.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.060
So I'm gonna promote a tech hub.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.540
What I'm also going to do

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.660
is change the narrative
around Palestinians.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.590
No longer are we going to have to go

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.750
and cross into Israel for employment.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.180
We're going to have
employment opportunities

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.780
here in the West Bank.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.780
Now, getting back into the
political side of the conflict,

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.860
very quickly, something that
was meant to be fully removed

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.750
from the political process,
Masri went as far as to build

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:57.050
only on area A to ensure
this, became highly political.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:59.010
There was of course the detractors,

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:03.240
and he spoke a little bit about
this, on the Israeli right.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.570
Settlers who saw this as a challenge

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.760
to Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.470
And they provided more of a nuisance

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:14.860
than an actual challenge,
when it came to it,

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.630
but were certainly an opposing force.

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:20.690
The second being BDS, which
looked at this and said,

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:24.830
well what you're doing is again
normalizing the occupation.

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:28.710
Though you're improving
the material conditions

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.570
of those who live in
Rawabi, you are normalizing

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:32.810
the same conditions.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.670
You're making life under the
same occupation more bearable.

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:38.270
And then there was the third one,

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:40.820
that in a contested geography like this,

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.430
even when you build on
Palestinian territory in area A,

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.660
you still are deeply connected

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.570
to an Israeli political system.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:51.940
So you heard Masri talk about water.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.660
One of the major challenges
that faced Rawabi

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.720
was actually getting water
access through area C.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.400
And for a long time,
construction of the project,

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.330
and having residents moved in, was delayed

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:05.080
because the Israeli government COGAT,

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.080
which administers the
territories, did not approve water

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.220
to be sent over.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.110
So it actually took pressure,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:15.560
from both the Palestinian side,

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.790
and as you're heard the Israeli left,

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:21.770
including Shimon Peres,
to get the water approved.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.590
But even now, with Rawabi
welcoming its first residents,

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:28.420
with water flowing to the city,

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.530
with the tech hub up and running,

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:34.210
it remains a highly-political
process to ensure its success.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.980
So one of the things that you'll notice

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:41.010
on this photo of the city,
is how narrow the road is

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:43.690
leading into Rawabi.

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:47.220
For a city of 40,000 people
it has a two-lane road,

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.230
so car on either side, coming in and out.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.760
And this can create
massive traffic buildups,

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.020
when you have folks coming into Rawabi

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.210
for a concert or an event.

00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.910
And again it will depend on
the Israeli administration

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.770
to approve expanding this road.

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.860
And even having residents cross

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.480
from a major Palestinian
city like Ramallah,

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.090
through area C, back into
area A to go to Rawabi.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.950
So again, even when you change
the conditions on the ground,

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:15.410
when you try to insulate yourself

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:18.450
from the political process
within this conflict,

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.283
it's quite hard to do so.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.080
At the same time, what
Masri is hoping to do

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.290
is change the status quo.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.630
If you're able to create this
and have it be successful

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:34.050
then you influence the
political process in turn.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:39.050
You see what Rawabi could be,
multiplied 10 over, 20 over,

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.200
which is a Palestinian state.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.370
You start on a small basis, as an example,

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.660
and then you move forward
with the opportunity to show

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.500
what Rawabi could be,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.223
and ultimately what a
Palestinian state could be.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.160
Now we're slightly tight on time,

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.300
so I'm going to go through
the video we had for EcoPeace.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.660
But this gets back to that original photo

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.540
that I showed when we started
thinking about the geography

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.683
of Israel and of Palestine.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:11.850
This is a photo in Gaza
City of the Mediterranean.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:16.570
So again, after conflict,
limited electricity,

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:20.400
the ability of Gaza to process
garbage, sewage, et cetera,

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.400
is quite limited.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:26.390
And what this does, is not
only impacts their coastline,

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.010
but goes up the coastline towards Israel.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:33.130
And moreover, if you're
thinking about ground water,

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:36.700
which is another key water
source within the region,

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.502
it can seep across the border from Gaza,

00:58:39.502 --> 00:58:41.730
into aquifers in Israel.

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.430
And what this points
out, and what EcoPeace,

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.970
which formed in the wake
of the Oslo Accords,

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:50.740
to actually bring
Palestinians, Jordanians,

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.830
and Israelis together, the first NGO,

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:54.900
and really the only lasting one to bring

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.230
those three groups
together, is to recognize

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.850
that even if the conflict
creates disengagement,

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.343
even if Gaza is separated from Israel,

00:59:07.144 --> 00:59:10.160
the demarcations of
the state, don't define

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.973
the actual geography
of it, the environment.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.110
And what they've basically
come and looked at

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.920
and seen that even you
have a political process

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.940
that is flawed, that isn't moving forward,

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.440
you can't disentangle

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.140
the environmental implications of this.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.390
So one of their main focus projects

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:31.140
has been looking at
the connection of water

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.790
between Israel and Palestine.

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:36.280
Finding ways for Israelis and Palestinians

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.150
to improve and work together

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.130
to improve the environment,
particularly water.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.370
So Gaza is a great example
of this because Israel,

00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:46.690
despite being fully disengaged from it,

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:49.620
has had to recognize the
environmental implications

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.143
of what's occurring in Gaza,

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.260
the destruction of capital infrastructure,

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.520
of the lack of electricity, et cetera.

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.740
But they've taken it a step further too.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.150
We're having this idea

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.890
of you have to leverage the environment,

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.700
or pay attention to the environment

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.180
because of the connection.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.940
They've taken it a step further and said,

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.940
well if we have a fundamental connection

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.780
through the environment, is there a way

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.880
that we can introduce a business,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.870
regardless of the political process,

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:20.810
to actually take that
reality of environmental

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.630
interconnectedness, and use it as a way

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.580
to create cooperation.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.090
And there's this idea,
and I encourage you all

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:29.970
to go into the case
and read more about it,

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:33.340
but an idea by Gidon
Bromberg, who is the founder

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.370
and Israel head of EcoPeace Middle East,

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:38.800
of a water/energy nexus.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.740
Looking at the differences between

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.330
the environmental resources
of Israel, Jordan,

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.680
and the Palestinian territories in Gaza,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.930
and finding a way to create an
actual and business incentive

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.240
for them all to collaborate.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.030
So Gidon looks at the situation and says,

01:00:55.030 --> 01:01:00.030
Jordan is limited in its
water, but it has huge amounts

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.880
of low-cost electricity
because of its deserts

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.230
and solar energy.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:08.590
What if there is a way to have Jordan send

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.270
its low-cost electricity across Israel

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:15.410
into a place like Gaza, which
has access to ocean water

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.810
which can be desalinated.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.320
Use that electricity to produce,

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.080
at low-cost desalinated water,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.910
which is then sent back
to Jordan via Israel?

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:30.990
Is there a way to align
business incentives

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:32.720
within an environmental context,

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.950
you have a problem with water scarcity,

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:38.730
and electricity being
scarce, is there a way

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.500
to combine these incentives,
to find a solution

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.924
that brings all the principals together,

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:45.790
from an environmental perspective?

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.410
So that's something that,
when we first talked to him

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.280
in the summer of 2018,
was in its infant stages,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.090
but he continues to push on,

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:57.550
as a way to take the
realities of the environment

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:01.363
of scarce resources and
create cooperation from that.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.650
So very quickly, this I think
is scratching the surface

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:08.850
of a lotta what's in the case.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.670
And I do hope you'll all take
the time to go through it.

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:14.780
But to summarize and go through
the lessons learned quickly,

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.317
I think the things that stick out to me,

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.890
and the things to
consider is how hard it is

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:24.400
for business to have a
political impact on the conflict

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.720
because one, the arguments
about normalizing the status quo

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.440
actually ignore the way
that it changes over time.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.570
Oftentimes, on both criticisms
from the left and the right,

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.060
you'll hear about
normalizing a status quo.

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:41.280
But how do we actually
define that if it's changing?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.030
And a few examples is
the economic divergence

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.907
between the West Bank and
Gaza, and then also from Israel

01:02:46.907 --> 01:02:49.410
and the West Bank and Gaza.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:53.910
A water crisis and general
humanitarian crisis in Gaza

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.270
growing worse and worse, and
its environmental implications.

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:02.150
And then also the changing
regional geopolitics.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.850
The fact that the principals,
who would have supported

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.070
the Palestinian cause,
perhaps more stringently,

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.360
thinking about the Gulf
countries especially,

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.083
are no longer as involved or as focused.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.430
The second is, there's neither
sticks or carrots present.

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:18.710
If you're thinking about Israel,

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.950
and you're thinking
about being in Tel Aviv,

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.260
it feels quite removed
from the conflict nowaday.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:28.590
If Israeli's economy is thriving
and most business leaders

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:31.780
are not seeing necessarily
the impetus for a change,

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.370
particularly on the Israeli side,

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.980
then what is the real incentive there?

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.730
It has been dangled, you
know since the Oslo Accords,

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:43.330
of accessing Gulf markets,
but if you're having other

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:48.100
factors in the region, such
as alliances against Iran,

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.500
bringing countries like
Israel and Saudi Arabia

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.010
closer and closer together,
then is there a need

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:55.290
to actually resolve the conflict?

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.650
And additionally, as
Professor Shapiro talked about

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:00.090
in the context of BTI,
there isn't a K-Group.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:02.440
When you have such a diverse economy,

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.170
even an organization
like BTI only represents

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.213
a fraction of the interests involved.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.050
The last one is the fact
that political neutrality

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:15.220
in a conflict like this is not an option.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.070
And again, getting back
to the point about why,

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.240
even when you're within
the political process,

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.970
and without the political process,

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:24.270
you can't wring the
politics out of politics.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:26.840
Even something like Rawabi,
which is meant to be

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.100
outside of the status quo,
outside of the political process,

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.823
is inherently political.

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:37.010
So I think what to step back and look at,

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.577
from both of these three examples,

01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:41.420
and the additional examples in the case,

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.610
is the best option forward
is to actually look

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:47.150
at scalable demonstration projects,

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.300
projects that operate on a smaller scale,

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.320
and use them as an example
that can be built on

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.650
to have a positive impact.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:56.840
For business leaders to start small

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.320
and use that to influence
the political process

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.153
as it moves forward.

01:05:00.153 --> 01:05:02.902
And I think these three,
though all very different,

01:05:02.902 --> 01:05:04.743
are an example of that.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:07.760
So what I'll do now is hand it back over

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.430
to Professor Shapiro, to talk about

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.830
some of the more conceptual components

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.130
that we have learned about.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.627
- Thank you very much Nick.

01:05:15.627 --> 01:05:18.877
(audience applauds)
Thank you.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.780
So as he said several times,

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.360
he's really scratched the surface

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.470
of this incredibly rich case,

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:33.270
that he has done most of the heavy lifting

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:34.190
to put together.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:38.150
He spent, I don't know how he
graduated from Yale College,

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:40.490
'cause he must have
spent half of his time,

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.830
when he was supposed
to be in classes here,

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:45.570
wandering around the Middle East.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:50.440
But nonetheless, I think that

01:05:51.293 --> 01:05:54.973
the place to start is where he ended.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.940
When you look at these conflicts there are

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.370
these endlessly repeated phrases

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.750
and they're repeated so
often that you have to wonder

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.780
whether they have any real referent.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.230
One is that the two-state solution is,

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.460
everybody repeats it as the only option,

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:16.590
whereas it's clearly the
case that it's not an option.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:21.430
And it hasn't been an
option for a long time.

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.070
And so, that's something to think about.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:30.020
But the other is this idea of
normalizing the status quo.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.390
And the thing about the phrase
normalizing the status quo,

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.350
it sounds like what you're normalizing

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:38.253
is the absence of change.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.450
But in fact, there was a very famous paper

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:47.450
published in 1975 by a Yale
faculty member now retired

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.570
called The limits of consensual decision,

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:54.010
in which he talked about the
concept of utility drift.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.800
And he had in mind the fact

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.350
that making things hard to change,

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:02.500
also makes it hard to change things

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.623
if the facts on the ground change.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:08.140
So the American founders
made the Constitution

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.470
very difficult to change,
but that doesn't mean

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.883
that we are locked into the
world as it existed in 1787.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.100
On the contrary, the
facts on the ground change

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:28.100
and then that can bubble up and influence

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.403
the way in which people
think about the status quo.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:37.030
And so, a few things just to highlight

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:41.660
that have come out of
Nick's presentation here,

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.363
and earlier discussion the failure of BTI.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.430
One is I think you cannot overstate,

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:51.890
and this is not just Israel or Palestine,

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:56.890
but the issue of water in the
upcoming years and decades,

01:07:56.970 --> 01:08:00.010
across the Middle East and North Africa,

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:03.140
that are either gonna
create catastrophic crises,

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:07.790
or force greater integration.

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:09.773
The fact is, what EcoPeace is doing,

01:08:13.137 --> 01:08:17.270
and by the way EcoPeace
has been around 30 years.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.020
It has directors from Jordan,
Palestine, and Israel.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.890
It's a genuinely tripartite organization.

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:28.510
But they are raising
capital for the project

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:31.330
that Nick talked about,
that is essentially

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:34.310
going to produce cheap
electricity in Jordan,

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:39.310
to supply water for Gaza
to manage its sewage,

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:44.250
so that Israeli desalination
plants can actually operate.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:47.703
And it's an example of the crisis forcing

01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:52.703
forms of cooperation that
hadn't even been thought about

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.040
five years ago.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.040
Another, you get a brief
sense from the Rawabi story,

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:06.040
is that most outsider's
perception of Palestinian workers

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.308
are laborers who will be going

01:09:09.308 --> 01:09:12.680
and working on building sites in Tel Aviv.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.450
But in fact, there are a
number of universities now

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:18.620
in the West Bank,

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:23.620
graduating 25 hundred
software engineers a year.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:29.020
These are people who are well educated

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.650
and are employable in many walks of life.

01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:36.620
Yadin Kaufmann in one of the
other things we mentioned

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:39.020
in the case has created something called

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.897
the Palestinian Internship
Program, where people in,

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.200
by the way Bashar al-Masri was
one of the people who did it,

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.290
you spend a, Palestinian
goes and spends a year

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:54.900
in an Israeli tech company,
and then has to go back.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.010
And several of the startups in Rawabi

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:01.650
are by graduates of, their tech startups,

01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:04.230
by graduates of the PIP,

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:06.720
the Palestinian Internship Program.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.410
He has also started a
venture capital fund,

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.810
with no Israeli money,

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:13.840
so it can't be seen as neo-colonialism

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.224
to fund Palestinian
startups in the West Bank,

01:10:18.224 --> 01:10:20.810
particularly in Rawabi.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.850
So again this is, it's
producing a new population,

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:27.670
a new generation of Palestinian youth

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:30.510
with very different education, background,

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:32.970
and credentials, and aspirations.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:36.610
And these people are
growing, they're multiplying.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.590
By the way, it produces some over things

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.820
that BDS doesn't like.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.800
Like growing inequality
within the West Bank,

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.010
because you're seeing a much
more differentiated economy.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:51.310
And by the way, considerable
divergence between

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:56.310
the economies of the West Bank and Gaza.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.540
Furthermore, the far right wing Israelis,

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.350
their agenda for a long
time, as in the video,

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.010
has basically been to
make life so unpleasant

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:08.400
for the Palestinians,

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.533
that eventually they will go to Jordan.

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:16.433
But the truth is that because
of the economic dynamism

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:18.650
in parts of the West Bank,

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.830
and the sorts of things
like Rawabi you're seeing,

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:23.970
is that the per capita
income in the West Bank,

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:27.820
not only is diverging
from Gaza, but is actually

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:32.790
soon going to equal and exceed
the per capita in Jordan.

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:37.790
So you may well start to see
the settlers' worst nightmare,

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.040
you may well actually start to
see Palestinians from Jordan

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.253
coming into the West Bank.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.911
And so this is another example where,

01:11:49.911 --> 01:11:54.340
the word status quo suggests no change,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.440
but in fact the change on the ground

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.490
is likely to start
forcing political change.

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:06.283
And as you saw at the end
of the post mortem video,

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:10.350
one of the Palestinian businessmen saying,

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:13.410
actually we have no
problem with one state,

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:15.350
but what we want is human rights.

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:18.530
And I think that this is ultimately

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:21.080
where this conflict is now headed.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.390
That people instead of
continuing to repeat the mantra

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:30.390
of a two-state solution, are
gonna start demanding the vote.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.810
And of course that is gonna
put a very different kinds

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:37.840
of pressures on Israeli politics.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.910
But I think it is clearly a case where,

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:46.760
unlike South Africa, where
the business community

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.770
could take a role in finding a settlement

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:53.840
that was potentially there,
but needed assistance

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.840
along the way, this conflict
isn't at that point,

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:01.571
but it certainly is heading to the point

01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:06.571
at which the sorts of
things that these businesses

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:11.870
have been doing will start
to make new possibilities

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.410
come onto the horizon, and
perhaps, which really has to

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:20.710
always happen for these kinds
of conflicts to be solved,

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:24.220
is for the unthinkable
to become thinkable.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:28.330
Okay we will talk about crisis, crash,

01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:30.243
and response, next Tuesday.

01:13:33.889 --> 01:13:36.639
(relaxing music)

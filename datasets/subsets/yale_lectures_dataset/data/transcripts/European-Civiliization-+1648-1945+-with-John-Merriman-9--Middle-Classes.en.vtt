00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.010
Prof: You know why I am
dressed up?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.476
When I do this course and when
I do the first half of the

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.225
French course I do a lecture on
the bourgeoisie,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.060
the middle classes.
 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.270
Middle class was a form of
self-identity that was

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.815
constructed in the way being a
worker was constructed,

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.220
or being a noble.
 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.137
One day I was about to go out
among you all and talk about

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.614
Daumier,
and show you some Daumier

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.550
slides about the bourgeoisie,
and my wife said to me,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.745
"You can't go talk about
the bourgeoisie looking like you

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:39.640
usually do.
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.884
You've got to look like you
mean it, like you have a vague

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:45.970
sense of knowing it."
 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.840
So, as a result, look at this.
 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.150
I wear this about once a year.
 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.130
Unfortunately,
I wear it to funerals.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.052
The last time I wore it was
something Bill Clinton had,

00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:59.650
some mutual friends.
 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.260
I only have one tie that I
share with my son.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.989
We had to find him another tie
underneath his soccer shoes.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:12.930
Then we got into New York and
went to this party,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.319
and we're all dolled up and all
that.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.421
Then we went out to a
restaurant and I lost my one

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:17.680
tie.
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.930
The last time I bought a tie,
ties cost fifteen dollars.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.510
In Ann Arbor I bought a tie.
 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.400
This is a seventy-five dollar
tie.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.489
This is my only tie.
 

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.266
That's a long way of answering
your question about why I look

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.099
like this today.
 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.970
But I hope to make some sense
of that in the lecture.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670
So, thank you very much.
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.849
I didn't set that question up,
did I?

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.123
I didn't ask you,
"Please ask that

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:40.590
question."
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.830
When you're looking at me
dressed, it's not Halloween.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.019
That's the first thing I
thought.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.370
When you look at me dressed
like this,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.629
please try to think,
knowing me a little bit as you

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.161
do,
why it was that it meant a lot

00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:59.840
to dress like this in the
nineteenth century.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.531
The middle classes started
dressing like this in the

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.715
nineteenth century,
dark with a little bit of

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:07.438
color.
 

00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:10.879
When you see Daumier or you see
Delacroix's famous,

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.877
which I forgot the slide,
Liberty Leading the

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:15.710
People,
and you see the bourgeois,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.318
there with his top hat,
he's dressed in a bourgeois

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:20.860
uniform like this.
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.110
That emerges out of the
bourgeois century.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.431
While last time we talked about
the construction of class

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:34.000
identity for ordinary people,
for working people,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.211
the bourgeoisie had as strong a
sense of self-identity as any

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.080
social class you could imagine.
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.626
It was, as I'll make the point
in a minute, difficult to get

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:51.949
into that class if you weren't
born into it.

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.904
The fear of falling out of it
was something that helps

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:59.633
motivate lots of political
things in the nineteenth

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:00.530
century.
 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.629
The nineteenth century,
in terms of being the bourgeois

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.050
century--one of the things you
see in countries,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.878
particularly in Western Europe
and Great Britain,

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:13.258
in France and in Germany,
and in Italy,

00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:17.185
is you see the middle classes
wanting the political power

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:20.128
commensurate with their economic
status.

00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:23.848
If, in the eighteenth
century--this is one of those

00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:28.164
truisms that happens to be true
and can be exaggerated--the

00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:30.781
aristocracy,
you were born into the

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:31.580
aristocracy.
 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.180
If you hit the big time and you
get lucky, you can buy your way

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.620
in, thanks to the broke French
monarchy.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.620
But the ideal aristocrat,
and this is how an aristocrat

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.340
would have talked about him or
herself,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.449
was born into the aristocracy
through blood,

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.129
through family.
 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.680
It was an ascribed status.
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.643
In the nineteenth century one
of the things that happens with

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:07.780
the French Revolution and with
Napoleon is that the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.164
middle-class person and
middle-class values seem to be

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:14.729
something to be emulated.
 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.459
Once we've got an increase in
the wealth of the middle classes

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.946
and the diversity and complexity
that I'll talk about in a

00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:23.887
minute,
then you wanted the political

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:24.180
power.
 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.209
You wanted the right to vote.
 

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:28.610
You wanted access to
information through the press

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.000
and print culture.
 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.970
All of these things are closely
tied to the middle classes.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.079
That's what I'm going to talk
about today.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.009
Most of it is about bourgeois
culture.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.759
That's why I'm dressed like
this.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.170
I assure you that the minute
this lecture is over,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.134
I will go back and like--I
could never compare myself to

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:54.605
Clark Kent--but I will find my
phone booth and change back into

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:55.759
normal duds.
 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:04.512
Let's talk a little bit about
the middle class in the

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.879
bourgeois century.
 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.377
The middle classes or the
bourgeoisie are terms that we

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:13.959
conveniently use.
 

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.810
Marx talked about the
bourgeoisie as being this

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.240
extremely homogenous class.
 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.930
In fact, the word
"bourgeois"

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.550
has really more cultural
connotations,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.266
maybe,
than objective or social

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:31.689
categorization,
living in a bourgeois manner.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.238
We'll see some aspects of that
in terms of access to private

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:40.709
space, middle-class concepts of
childhood, and that sort of

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:41.480
thing.
 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.310
Middle classes is probably a
better term.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.920
Bourgeois is equivalent of
burgher, but middle classes is

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.079
probably, for our point of view,
a better term.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:56.059
It seems rather odd to be
talking about the English

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.488
bourgeoisie of Leeds,
about which there is an

00:05:59.488 --> 00:06:02.750
excellent book,
because bourgeois, after all,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.199
started out as a French word.
 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.158
In using and indeed insisting
on the term "middle

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:10.392
classes,"
what I'm suggesting is the

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:12.850
enormous complexity of the
middle class.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.449
There wasn't just one middle
class.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:23.273
Yet the middle classes shared
some cultural values and symbols

00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:31.353
in common and when challenged by
ordinary people could snap back

00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:37.509
in an extremely cohesive
class-based manner.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:46.000
Marx had some of that quite
correctly.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.307
In a Parisian newspaper called
the Journal des

00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:54.418
Débats in 1847,
someone actually did a pretty

00:06:54.418 --> 00:06:56.759
damn good job of describing the
bourgeoisie.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.439
"The bourgeoisie is not a
class," the person argued.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.389
"It is a position.
 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.189
One acquires that position and
one loses it.

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.459
Work, thrift,
and ability confer it,"

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:13.050
he argued, referring to
himself, of course.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.949
"Vice dissipation and
idleness mean that it can be

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:19.129
lost."
 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.103
And, so, that old kind of
aristocratic ethos of not

00:07:25.103 --> 00:07:30.230
working, of being idle,
although it can be exaggerated,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.154
as we've seen in the
seventeenth and eighteenth

00:07:32.154 --> 00:07:34.452
centuries,
nonetheless there was something

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:34.850
to it.
 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:41.463
An eighteenth century noble let
his fingernails grow long,

00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:48.309
sort of just hung out showing
his good taste by living in an

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:51.790
idle, aristocratic manner.
 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.529
The bourgeoisie did anything
but that.

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:59.754
Work was part of how they
believed to get ahead,

00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:03.889
and getting ahead is what they
wanted to do.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:07.216
The French Revolution,
and here's an important point,

00:08:07.216 --> 00:08:10.302
I guess,
opened the way by removing

00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:16.610
legal blocks in very many places
to the career open to talents.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.218
Napoleon used to say tediously
that in each soldier's backpack

00:08:21.218 --> 00:08:24.089
there was a marshal's
baton,

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:27.644
or staff that you could get
promoted with good work,

00:08:27.644 --> 00:08:30.608
hard work,
if you didn't get your head

00:08:30.608 --> 00:08:33.279
blown off in one of these
battles.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:38.500
But certainly one of the things
that comes out of his insistence

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.809
on service to the state is
creating a whole series of

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:47.700
rewards that recompensed
virtuous action and hard work.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.077
That's what the
Légion d'honneur,

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:53.720
the Legion of Honor was all
about.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.090
Making money was part of it.
 

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.673
Of course, it was always in the
nineteenth century sort of

00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:01.440
classic to poke fun at bourgeois
culture,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.240
and in some cases the lack of
it,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.898
and to ascribe to the middle
classes philistine habits in

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:12.889
which making money was really
the only thing that counted.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:16.774
Certainly, Friedrich Engels,
Marx's socialist

00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:20.399
partner--obsessed,
as well he should have been,

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:24.115
with the slums of the satanic
mills of Manchester--he once

00:09:24.115 --> 00:09:25.548
wrote the following.
 

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:29.058
He says, "One day I walked
with one of these middle class

00:09:29.058 --> 00:09:30.668
gentlemen into Manchester.
 

00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:32.519
I spoke to him about the
disgraceful,

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:35.519
unhealthy slums and drew his
attention to the disgusting

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:38.683
condition of that part of town
in which the factory workers

00:09:38.683 --> 00:09:39.230
lived.
 

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.453
I declared that I'd never seen
so badly built a town in my

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:42.850
life.
 

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.176
He listened patiently and at
the end of the corner of a

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:48.517
street at which we parted,
he remarked,

00:09:48.517 --> 00:09:51.042
â€˜And yet,
there is a good deal of money

00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:51.799
to be made here.
 

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.889
Good morning, sir.
 

00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:54.620
And he walked away."
 

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.918
One employer wrote in the 1830s
that,

00:09:56.918 --> 00:10:01.419
relative to his workers--is
that the worker,

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:04.861
I couldn't invent this,
"should be constantly

00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:08.158
harassed by need,
for then he will not set his

00:10:08.158 --> 00:10:12.958
children a bad example and his
poverty will be the guarantee of

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.740
good behavior."
 

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.167
Of course, this is a caricature
of middle class self-absorption,

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:25.554
of narcissism,
of this inveterate cruelty to

00:10:25.554 --> 00:10:28.309
the classes below them.
 

00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:30.662
On the other hand,
the more we study the middle

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:33.678
classes--and in the 1960s people
really didn't study the middle

00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:36.159
classes because they didn't like
them very much.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.820
They studied workers.
 

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.094
But there's been an awful lot
of good work done on the middle

00:10:41.094 --> 00:10:41.639
classes.
 

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.970
Among them my dear friend Peter
Gay,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.220
his five volumes of the
Bourgeois Century,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.818
take on the idea that the
middle class lived without

00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:56.210
passion,
and were philistines,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.350
and that sort of thing.
 

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.408
The more we look at the middle
class now,

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:04.433
we see certainly that no matter
where you look one of the things

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:09.379
the middle class people did was
form voluntary associations.

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:12.230
Aristocrats didn't form
voluntary associations.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.418
They didn't need to.
 

00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:16.221
The middle class formed
voluntary associations,

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:19.634
and many of these were for
extremely charitable purposes,

00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:21.340
particularly in Britain.
 

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.966
Again, the study that I
referred to by somebody called

00:11:24.966 --> 00:11:29.275
Morris--I think it's Morris--on
Leeds shows the kind of richness

00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:33.380
and depth to these voluntary
associations in which people try

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.460
to do an awful lot for ordinary
people.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.460
It has a sense of moralizing.
 

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.327
There's always this sort of
top-down look about moralizing

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:45.714
them,
and trying to get the workers

00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:48.317
to drink less,
trying to get them to go to

00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:50.059
church,
trying to get them,

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:53.880
when it was possible,
for their children to become

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.538
educated and stay in school.
 

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:58.602
There's always this tension
between families who needed

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:01.100
children's income,
however small that was.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.470
Across the nineteenth century,
over a very long period,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.813
laws finally by the end of the
century in most places made at

00:12:11.813 --> 00:12:15.200
least primary education
obligatory,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.519
and in most cases free.
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.110
Here's a ridiculous example.
 

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.250
It's not a ridiculous example
if you love animals.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.798
I'm a cat person,
as I already said.

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.370
The Society for the Protection
of Cruelty to Animals,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.860
these sorts of organizations
really are one of the classic

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.840
examples of bourgeois voluntary
associations doing good things.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.500
They also get together to hang
out with each other and sort of

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.500
try to gauge who has more money
than the other,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.779
and they get together for
social reasons in the

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:46.990
coffeehouses of England,
and in the clubs,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.850
circles you call them in
France,

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.750
and their equivalents in
Germany, and Italy,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.120
and Spain.
 

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.370
One of the more ludicrous kind
of mottos,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.830
we call it a devise,
a motto,

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.083
of the Society for the
Protection of Cruelty to Animals

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:10.519
was in one of the organizations
in France, which said,

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.575
"One must love animals,
but not fraternize with

00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:14.419
animals."
 

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:17.445
I don't know what that means,
but the main thing is that they

00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:20.269
wanted to save animals from
being beaten,

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:23.090
almost beaten to death in many
cases of horses.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.658
You can see how,
in places in which bullfighting

00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:27.547
over the long run in the
nineteenth and twentieth

00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:29.434
century,
such as the very south of

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.663
France and in Spain--there were
always movements to try to

00:13:32.663 --> 00:13:35.538
protect the bulls,
which seems like a reasonable

00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:36.269
thing to do.
 

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.980
For all the bad press that the
middle class has had,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.644
and you can read some of this
bad press in what you're

00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:44.466
reading,
there is also this good side

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:47.210
that should be evoked as well.
 

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.470
That's a period.
 

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.009
Certainly, in terms of
organized religion,

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:59.928
the middle class goes to church
more than ordinary people,

00:13:59.928 --> 00:14:02.259
than workers,
for sure.

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.009
In the case of peasants it
depends on where.

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:07.220
As I said before,
in many parts of France,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.916
the example that's well
studied, you still had this

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.210
de-Christianization.
 

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.514
But certainly religion was a
fundamental part of the British

00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:17.850
middle class's view of itself.
 

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.726
The percentage of people who
went to church could be

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:22.788
exaggerated.
 

00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:26.070
There was a study in all of
England.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.767
I don't think it was in Wales
and Scotland,

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:29.625
but at least it was in England,
maybe in Wales,

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.038
too, probably in Wales as well.
 

00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:34.706
I think it was in 1851 where
they decided to look at every

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:37.601
single church in England and
Wales, let's say,

00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:40.558
and to see how many people went
to church.

00:14:40.558 --> 00:14:44.548
They found to their horror that
it was less than they thought.

00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:48.121
They also discovered that if
everybody who had wanted to go

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.710
to church had gone to various
churches,

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.899
Methodist for more ordinary
people, Anglican,

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:58.976
Catholic for the Irish and for
a certain minority of British

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:02.538
citizens,
or Jews going to synagogue in

00:15:02.538 --> 00:15:06.073
the east end of London,
that they couldn't have

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:07.899
accommodated all these people.
 

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:11.407
So there's a massive kind of
church building campaign that

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:14.730
has its counterpart in almost
every country as well.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.836
Certainly in France after the
Paris Commune of 1871 they start

00:15:18.836 --> 00:15:23.009
building churches in the working
class districts perched on the

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:24.288
edge of cities.
 

00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:26.250
More about that in another
lecture.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.428
One could go on and on about
this.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:35.182
Religion for the middle classes
has a greater role in their

00:15:35.182 --> 00:15:39.490
lives than in working class
cities.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.914
In the case of the peasants,
there weren't any peasants left

00:15:41.914 --> 00:15:42.450
in England.
 

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.154
I'll talk about that and it
will be fun to talk about in one

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.409
of these lectures.
 

00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:49.259
Anyway, there we go.
 

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:52.504
How many people would have
considered themselves

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:53.538
middle-class?
 

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:57.960
Again, self-identity,
how people thought of

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.379
themselves is one of those
aspects that we want to discuss.

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:06.710
How do we know?
 

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.860
How would you know who is
middle-class?

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.414
When they first started doing
censuses--and censuses are

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:16.841
really a nineteenth-century
phenomenon, and subsequent

00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:18.908
centuries, as I said before.
 

00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:21.859
The first census was in
Copenhagen, I think,

00:16:21.859 --> 00:16:23.778
in the eighteenth century.
 

00:16:23.778 --> 00:16:27.086
The first real censuses do not
come until the nineteenth

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.769
century almost everywhere.
 

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:33.105
They didn't ask people--they
asked you your name and where

00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:34.019
you lived.
 

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:36.120
In some cases they asked you
your profession.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.602
But they did not say,
"Are you middle

00:16:37.602 --> 00:16:38.110
class?"
 

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.019
or "Are you not middle
class?"

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:43.121
There was a whole lot of work
done in the 1970s on what they

00:16:43.121 --> 00:16:45.120
used to call the new urban
history,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.775
which is counting people up and
deciding who might well have

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:51.070
considered themselves
middle-class.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.150
There are a lot of
dissertations written on that

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.860
kind of thing.
 

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.250
There was one in the case of
Paris.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.126
Inevitably I have to talk some
about Paris because the work is

00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:57.620
so rich there.
 

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.457
A woman called Adeline Daumard
wrote a dissertation that was

00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:03.490
subsequently published called
Les Bourgeois de Paris,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.842
or The Bourgeois of
Paris in the First Half

00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:07.288
of the Nineteenth Century.
 

00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:10.278
What she did is she looked at
wills.

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:14.000
The middle-class people had
enough money to leave wills,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.910
therefore, their inventories
after death.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.278
That's what you call them.
 

00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:21.865
That's one of the reasons we
know about the explosion of

00:17:21.865 --> 00:17:23.839
print culture,
because they inventoried the

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.108
books that people read.
 

00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:27.284
I mentioned this in the context
of Enlightenment,

00:17:27.284 --> 00:17:28.960
too, because you do have that,
too.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.690
Taking the kinds of ways that
she looked at social class,

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.663
she determined that somewhere
between seventeen and nineteen

00:17:39.663 --> 00:17:43.300
percent of the Parisian
population in the first half of

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.680
the nineteenth century would
have been considered bourgeois,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.818
and would have considered
themselves bourgeois,

00:17:50.818 --> 00:17:54.900
that is,
in the middle classes.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.430
In Britain the percentage is
higher.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.950
It probably approaches
twenty-five percent.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.910
I can't remember the exact
figures.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.395
That percent will continue to
increase in the nineteenth

00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:09.028
century.
 

00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:11.544
You can already very well
anticipate, from what you

00:18:11.544 --> 00:18:13.556
already know,
where other parts of Europe

00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:15.818
that have large important middle
classes.

00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:17.848
The old Hanseatic port cities
of German,

00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:23.107
the German free cities that
would become part of unified

00:18:23.107 --> 00:18:27.888
Germany in 1871--northern German
cities in general,

00:18:27.888 --> 00:18:31.140
like Bremen,
and Lübeck,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.480
and Hamburg above all.
 

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.450
Hamburg's a huge port city.
 

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.019
It's got a very enormous
bourgeoisie.

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:42.073
If you went to Madrid,
you'd find a sizeable middle

00:18:42.073 --> 00:18:45.493
class, but it would be nothing
that you would have if you

00:18:45.493 --> 00:18:47.509
compared Madrid to Barcelona.
 

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:51.352
Barcelona is a really natural
economy based upon important

00:18:51.352 --> 00:18:55.328
economic relations between its
hinterland and Barcelona,

00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:56.970
and between Barcelona and the
world,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.068
because it's a major port.
 

00:18:58.068 --> 00:19:02.799
So, you've got this big teaming
middle class there as well.

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:07.233
In the case of France,
obviously places that have lots

00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:11.660
of industry and small businesses
have middle-class people in

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.363
large numbers,
though not as large numbers as

00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:14.769
workers.
 

00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:16.940
Lyon would be a good example.
 

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.090
Lyon has the most tightly
closed middle class that you can

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.960
imagine and still is.
 

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.720
Lyon is very Lyon.
 

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.868
What can one say?
 

00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:26.762
Again, northern Italy you find
a huge vibrant middle class,

00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:28.160
but not in southern Italy.
 

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.060
Naples is one of the biggest
cities in Europe right through

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.808
the early-modern period.
 

00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:36.948
You've got a large middle
class, but most of Italy is

00:19:36.948 --> 00:19:40.630
extremely rural and what you had
in Rome is you had clergy.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.002
It's a city,
so you've got an important

00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:43.940
middle class.
 

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.641
The further east you get,
the smaller the middle class

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:48.130
gets.
 

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.026
In Russia, the estimates are
about two percent of the

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:54.348
population were middle class.
 

00:19:54.348 --> 00:19:55.920
Two percent,
which isn't very much at all.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.561
And, of course,
they are clustered in Moscow

00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.298
and in St.
 

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.807
Petersburg, and in Kiev,
now Ukraine,

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:08.848
always Ukraine but then part of
Russia, in the large cities.

00:20:08.848 --> 00:20:12.586
In Poland, Warsaw had a
large--I was just at a history

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:16.605
museum, a fascinating one at
Warsaw Museum a couple months

00:20:16.605 --> 00:20:17.170
ago.
 

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:22.769
Warsaw, as Krakow,
had a big middle class.

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:25.468
GdaÅ„sk, obviously,
because it's a port city--but

00:20:25.468 --> 00:20:28.503
much of Poland was rural and
wouldn't have that kind of

00:20:28.503 --> 00:20:29.460
middle class.
 

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.023
Belgrade would have been the
only city in the Balkans,

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.050
outside of Istanbul,
but Istanbul isn't in the

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.279
Balkans, but with an important
middle class.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.568
This is all perfectly obvious.
 

00:20:40.568 --> 00:20:43.900
Anyway, who are these folks and
what do they want?

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.690
They're not all--how am I going
to do this?

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.009
I'm going to do it like this.
 

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:54.007
You have to imagine the middle
class like this,

00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:55.920
that it's a pyramid.
 

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:04.318
It's a pyramid with a small top
and a big bottom.

00:21:04.318 --> 00:21:06.795
I'll show you a lithograph that
really represents,

00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:08.715
two of these,
in very interesting ways,

00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:10.990
I think compelling ways at the
beginning.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.380
At the very top--think of
Zurich.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.279
Think of any city you want.
 

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:19.108
Zurich has a big middle class.
 

00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:20.608
So does Geneva for obvious
reasons.

00:21:20.608 --> 00:21:25.597
But at the very top there are
the great bourgeoisie,

00:21:25.597 --> 00:21:27.750
the big bourgeoisie.
 

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.038
These are people who are big
financiers.

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:33.885
The nineteenth century bankers
will become much more important

00:21:33.885 --> 00:21:35.380
for perfectly obvious reasons.
 

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.335
These are big wholesale
merchants who are making bundles

00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:43.670
shipping things from here to
there.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.548
You won't yet find lawyers and
people like that.

00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:49.608
What also makes them the high
bourgeoisie or the big

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.608
bourgeoisie,
a small percentage,

00:21:51.608 --> 00:21:55.200
it doesn't really matter where
this line goes,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.160
is that they have access to
political power.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.232
Even if they're in Prussia,
a place that's dominated by the

00:22:03.232 --> 00:22:04.980
nobles who are called the
Junkers,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.979
as most of you know,
they will still have access by

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:10.150
virtue of their wealth to
political power,

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.868
which is exactly the way they
want it.

00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:14.864
There's a revolution in France
in 1830, yet another one that

00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:15.930
you can read about.
 

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.616
Arguably--Marx says this and in
a way it's sort of true--what it

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:23.130
does is it brings to power in
France the big bourgeoisie,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.519
and they have the ear of the
king, Louis-Philippe,

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.400
who calls himself the Citizen
King.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.230
He would rule from 1830 to 1848.
 

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.079
In the portraits of him,
the paintings that he had done

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:39.286
to represent who he was are very
different than those of the

00:22:39.286 --> 00:22:40.568
Bourbon kings.
 

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:44.390
The Bourbon kings are all
looking like,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.118
even the pathetic successors of
Louis XIV,

00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:52.364
they're looking like big people
in chateaus who are kings of all

00:22:52.364 --> 00:22:55.328
that they see,
which of course was more or

00:22:55.328 --> 00:22:56.338
less the case.
 

00:22:56.338 --> 00:22:59.268
Louis-Philippe's view of
himself was that he was the

00:22:59.268 --> 00:23:00.130
Citizen King.
 

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.430
That's what he calls himself.
 

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.509
He's still the king.
 

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:03.299
He was noble.
 

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:04.740
He was not any bourgeois.
 

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.049
But in the official paintings
of him you see people dressed

00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:12.470
like me who are coming into the
throne room.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.839
They're dressed like me in dark
suits.

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:17.660
They have power.
 

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.779
He wants them in the painting
with him.

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:21.460
That's terribly revealing.
 

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.538
It's terribly interesting.
 

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:25.000
So, these are people,
these are big bankers,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.660
high financiers at the top.
 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.619
Then you've got other layers of
bourgeoisie.

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:32.079
You can kind of fill in the gap.
 

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:36.117
Here we have smaller bankers,
not in size but in money,

00:23:36.117 --> 00:23:38.759
industrialists,
merchants,

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:42.619
these kinds of people,
and Daumier's,

00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:46.098
the great caricaturist's,
least favorite people--;lawyers.

00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:54.230
Lawyers rise up rapidly in
popular esteem and usefulness.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.598
The middle class likes to see
themselves as useful.

00:23:57.598 --> 00:24:01.903
You find lawyers reaching in
there and, slowly,

00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:02.838
doctors.
 

00:24:02.838 --> 00:24:04.838
Remember doctors had very low
social status.

00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:07.420
They were sort of a cut above
the bad pun I make in what you

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.127
read,
ordinary field surgeons during

00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:15.509
Napoleonic battles,
some of whom were butchers or

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:18.240
people that knew how to wield a
knife.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.483
Doctors increase a
self-identity and become more

00:24:20.483 --> 00:24:22.298
important in the nineteenth
century.

00:24:22.298 --> 00:24:25.588
You also find notaries no
matter what country you're in.

00:24:25.588 --> 00:24:29.519
Notaries have a much bigger
role in Europe than they do

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.028
here.
 

00:24:30.028 --> 00:24:32.470
Notaries know where all the
goodies are.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.798
When you buy property in
France, by the way,

00:24:37.798 --> 00:24:40.920
if you have a mortgage you pay
twelve percent right off the top

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.038
goes to the notary just for
holding in his office your deed.

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:47.167
If you don't have a mortgage,
you pay seven percent right off

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:47.690
the top.
 

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:52.140
So, notaries know all of the
secrets of people with money.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.964
Notaries are important in all
these countries,

00:24:54.964 --> 00:24:56.410
et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.260
You can kind of fill in the
occupation, but they share

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.230
things together.
 

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.839
Then at the bottom you have the
petty bourgeoisie,

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:05.557
and everybody's making fun of
the petty bourgeoisie,

00:25:05.557 --> 00:25:07.528
but they too had a
self-identity.

00:25:07.528 --> 00:25:12.047
I found one day in the stacks
of the library at the University

00:25:12.047 --> 00:25:16.343
of Michigan a pamphlet that was
actually the report on what

00:25:16.343 --> 00:25:21.221
surely must have been the last,
but in any case was the first

00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:24.348
World Congress of the Petty
Bourgeoisie.

00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:26.660
They met, appropriately enough,
in Brussels.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.019
Can you imagine going to a
professional history conference

00:25:29.019 --> 00:25:30.798
where they all had their little
nametags?

00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:32.999
All they do is they start up
your body and look at your

00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:35.240
nametags, and see if it's worth
looking at your face.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.930
It's really pathetic.
 

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.088
Can you imagine going to a
conference like the World

00:25:40.088 --> 00:25:42.318
Congress of the Petty
Bourgeoisie?

00:25:42.318 --> 00:25:46.640
"Hi, my name is
Albert."

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.808
But they had a self-identity.
 

00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:50.759
Who are in the petty
bourgeoisie?

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:53.634
Lots of these classically new
nineteenth-century

00:25:53.634 --> 00:25:55.470
professions--schoolteachers.
 

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.059
Schoolteachers were a way of
social mobility for peasant

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:04.423
families,
whether they were in Italy,

00:26:04.423 --> 00:26:07.680
Germany, Austria,
Hungary, Switzerland,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.710
no matter where they were.
 

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.929
Out of the working class or out
of the peasantry female

00:26:12.929 --> 00:26:16.028
schoolteachers become
increasingly more important.

00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:19.042
They always were in Catholic
schools because they were nuns

00:26:19.042 --> 00:26:23.068
with the big hats and all that,
and doing a very good job,

00:26:23.068 --> 00:26:25.250
even though often they were
undereducated and it was kind of

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.250
hard for them to do that.
 

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.835
But schoolteachers you'd find
here, and also café

00:26:30.835 --> 00:26:33.920
or tavern owners,
weinstube owners.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.049
I'm just giving you a couple
examples.

00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:38.180
These are the petty bourgeoisie.
 

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.558
Also, very importantly,
what do you do with artisans

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:42.618
and craftsmen?
 

00:26:42.618 --> 00:26:48.609
Master artisans own the tools
that their journeymen work with.

00:26:48.609 --> 00:26:51.608
They rent or own their shops.
 

00:26:51.608 --> 00:26:54.520
When things are going pretty
well they do pretty well

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.250
themselves.
 

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.858
But when things aren't going
well, they don't do well.

00:26:57.858 --> 00:27:00.365
That's why they're on the
barricades all these times,

00:27:00.365 --> 00:27:02.724
as you know,
in the French Revolution--;the

00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:05.670
French revolutions,
and in the revolutions of 1848,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.769
as you shall discover in Vienna
and Berlin,

00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:08.809
and other places.
 

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:09.880
They're always there.
 

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.528
These folks are here, too.
 

00:27:11.528 --> 00:27:16.538
This is your basic petty
bourgeoisie.

00:27:16.538 --> 00:27:20.769
People are always dumping all
over them needlessly.

00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:22.108
I will give you some example.
 

00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:25.743
If you've ever read the great
French novelist--;he was paid by

00:27:25.743 --> 00:27:27.804
the word,
as you can see when he has

00:27:27.804 --> 00:27:30.855
descriptions of single sofas
that go on for about two pages,

00:27:30.855 --> 00:27:31.578
but Balzac.
 

00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:37.640
Balzac is really the novelist
of the bourgeoisie.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.838
When he describes Paris and the
seventeen to nineteen percent of

00:27:41.838 --> 00:27:45.038
the population who are
increasingly living in the

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:48.019
western part of Paris,
more about that another time,

00:27:48.019 --> 00:27:50.490
he describes it as a jungle.
 

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.327
You count your money in the
morning and then you count your

00:27:53.327 --> 00:27:54.650
money when you come home.
 

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.736
By the way, your wife,
who would in the census be

00:27:57.736 --> 00:27:59.279
listed as not working.
 

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.881
If you were a shopkeeper,
your wife was the one who kept

00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:02.970
care of the accounts.
 

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.037
Your wife was the one who stood
behind the counter when you were

00:28:06.037 --> 00:28:07.789
working, when you were an
artisan.

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:10.420
He describes this as a jungle.
 

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.480
In order to really give an
image of what it was like,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.618
I've got to find this thing
someplace,

00:28:16.618 --> 00:28:18.878
but he's got this one
magnificent print called the

00:28:18.878 --> 00:28:21.000
"Street of the Four
Winds."

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.980
That's a street in Paris,
rue des quatre vents,

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.329
near the Odéon.
 

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:26.150
It doesn't matter.
 

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.940
But here's a guy dressed like
me.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.970
There's a theme in this.
 

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.730
He's dressed like me and he's
wearing his bourgeois hat.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.848
I don't have one of those.
 

00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:35.490
My only hat has an M for
Michigan on it.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.670
His one suit isn't going to
blow off his body.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.298
But the wind is taking his hat,
which is a symbol of who he is.

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:47.990
The wind is carrying it away
from his hand.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.930
In several hundred
brushstrokes,

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.446
Daumier captures the look of
panic on his face because he's

00:28:55.446 --> 00:28:57.630
going to go home without his
hat,

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.348
and his wife's going to say,
"Where's your hat?"

00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:00.693
He'll say, "The wind blew
it away,"

00:29:00.693 --> 00:29:03.190
and he's got to buy one,
and they've got to put the

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.915
money together so he is not
going to fall off the ladder in

00:29:06.915 --> 00:29:07.880
this jungle.
 

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.160
Then you have to imagine this
as a ladder, like this.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.440
Social mobility is the goal.
 

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.920
You want to have enough money
to leave to your 2.2 children.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.758
Then to really make this go
you'd have to have vines up here

00:29:24.758 --> 00:29:25.930
like the jungle.
 

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:31.368
Then you'd have to grease this
pole through bad economic times.

00:29:31.368 --> 00:29:37.019
Let's say in Europe
1816-17--don't write this down,

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:40.391
if you do,
you're compulsive--I'm

00:29:40.391 --> 00:29:46.640
compulsive--but 1826-27,1840-41,
really bad one, 1846-47,1855,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.048
those are the really bad years.
 

00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:49.700
At that point,
if you don't get credit,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.220
that's what's going on now,
here.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.621
If you can't get credit because
people withdraw the credit,

00:29:54.621 --> 00:29:56.440
same thing, then here you go.
 

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.859
Look out below.
 

00:29:57.859 --> 00:30:00.539
You slide down this pole.
 

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:02.380
What happens down below here?
 

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.380
Holy cow!
 

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.598
That's the big sea.
 

00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:08.810
I saw this wretched movie
called the Poseidon

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:09.798
Adventure once.
 

00:30:09.798 --> 00:30:13.041
It had an image where the water
is kind of coming up below and

00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:16.392
it's going to finally get to the
top and there's no more room to

00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:17.028
breathe.
 

00:30:17.028 --> 00:30:20.221
This is how the people on the
bottom part of this ladder

00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:22.660
viewed the demands of the
working class.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.288
They want to vote, too.
 

00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:27.211
What if they vote and somebody
wants to raise your taxes or

00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:28.319
something like that?
 

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.559
Boy, that's scary.
 

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:30.650
But what's down here?
 

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.410
This is ordinary people.
 

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.798
This is the other,
what would it be in the case of

00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:39.118
Paris, eighty-three percent of
the population.

00:30:39.118 --> 00:30:46.790
You're going to fall into the
ranks of the proletariat if

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.450
you're on the bottom rungs here.
 

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.743
This is your jungle and you're
trying to make it up there to

00:30:56.743 --> 00:30:58.088
the big time.
 

00:30:58.088 --> 00:31:03.685
The chances are that in these
bad years you're going to fall

00:31:03.685 --> 00:31:04.348
down.
 

00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:08.067
But yet lots of people get up
and the ranks of the middle

00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:11.520
class increases everywhere in
the nineteenth century,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.579
in Russia, too,
everywhere.

00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:15.368
That's simply the case.
 

00:31:15.368 --> 00:31:26.423
Now, if I could just bring this
down and show you how this

00:31:26.423 --> 00:31:29.641
works,
and talk about some

00:31:29.641 --> 00:31:34.599
accoutrements of middle class
culture that you will recognize,

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:35.509
many of you.
 

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:36.910
This is the guy at the top.
 

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.769
This is Daumier.
 

00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:41.025
Daumier is the greatest
caricaturist in the nineteenth

00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:44.403
century and arguably ever,
to make an extreme assertion,

00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.430
but it really is pretty true.
 

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:53.803
This is what he captures,
the prevailing mood in much of

00:31:53.803 --> 00:31:59.156
Europe in that money,
more than blood if you were

00:31:59.156 --> 00:32:04.530
going to exclude places like
Hungary, Poland,

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:12.190
Spain, and Prussia,
money talks more than blood.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.250
What is the man doing?
 

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.730
He's counting his money.
 

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.489
Remember I said that you
counted your money in the

00:32:17.489 --> 00:32:20.980
morning and then you came home
at night, and counted your money

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.839
again to see how you've done.
 

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:24.700
This is great.
 

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.420
Remember I said the variations
within the bourgeoisie?

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.308
You can see this.
 

00:32:29.308 --> 00:32:31.115
Some of these images,
this is really not very

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.920
interesting art,
but that's not the point.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.118
Look what this shows.
 

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:37.568
The guy at the left here is a
clerk.

00:32:37.568 --> 00:32:40.084
That's a very
nineteenth-century profession,

00:32:40.084 --> 00:32:41.779
as it is for every subject.
 

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:45.351
By the way, this is before the
1860s, because that's when real

00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:47.048
fountain pens are invented.
 

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:48.910
He's got your basic quill pen
there.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.430
Now look at the coats.
 

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.243
They both have coats like mine,
but there's a huge difference

00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:54.880
in them.
 

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.472
This guy, if you have
extraordinary eyes and can read

00:32:58.472 --> 00:33:01.186
upside down,
you will be able to see that he

00:33:01.186 --> 00:33:04.054
is reading a newspaper on the
price of colonial goods,

00:33:04.054 --> 00:33:04.650
imports.
 

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.210
He is a wholesale merchant.
 

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.710
He's one of these people that's
at the very top of my triangle

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.170
there.
 

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.490
Look, this guy's got his coat,
too.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.869
This is early in the century.
 

00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:14.970
You can tell.
 

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:18.058
This is either the son-in-law
or the would-be son-in-law.

00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:21.720
The bourgeoisie didn't kiss and
hug a lot.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.815
But he's got his hand draped
rather daintily on the old guy's

00:33:26.815 --> 00:33:27.750
arm here.
 

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:32.938
He's not about to embrace him
and give him a big kiss on each

00:33:32.938 --> 00:33:33.630
cheek.
 

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:39.045
One day all of this stuff will
be his, if he plays his cards

00:33:39.045 --> 00:33:39.779
right.
 

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:41.210
They still had arranged
marriages.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:44.605
Love could count for something,
but marriages were still

00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:47.222
essentially,
less so for the middle classes

00:33:47.222 --> 00:33:50.380
than for ordinary people,
but economic relationships.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.318
That's what they were.
 

00:33:51.318 --> 00:33:53.411
They were economic
relationships,

00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:56.680
wrangling over the dowry and
that kind of thing.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.059
Look at our guy on the left.
 

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:00.640
He's working very hard there.
 

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.157
This pole that is put up there
has a real sense of dividing

00:34:06.157 --> 00:34:06.920
these.
 

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.577
It's like the barriers on my
quite arbitrary,

00:34:09.577 --> 00:34:12.539
and not terribly well designed,
triangle there.

00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:14.619
Do these people have something
in common?

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:17.775
Yes, they will in 1830 and they
will in 1848,

00:34:17.775 --> 00:34:20.500
but the rest of the time they
don't.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.070
He's dreaming about being this
guy.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.619
He'll work very hard and he's
educated.

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:30.909
He had probably not secondary
education.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.697
Most people didn't go to high
school, secondary,

00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:37.257
lycée in France
or gymnasium in Germany,

00:34:37.257 --> 00:34:38.739
et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.219
It represents this world.
 

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:46.902
By the way, we also know that
this takes place in the center

00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:49.344
of Paris,
right behind a big department

00:34:49.344 --> 00:34:51.677
store,
subsequently the Hotel de

00:34:51.677 --> 00:34:58.440
Ville,
but right near the town hall.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.579
Anyway, there we go.
 

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:04.679
I've got to get my watch so I
can keep track of things here.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:07.440
This is very common.
 

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.010
You see this in the book you're
reading, I think.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:19.449
These things can be represented
spatially very easily.

00:35:19.449 --> 00:35:23.411
One of the themes of the long
run is the emergence of

00:35:23.411 --> 00:35:27.449
increased development of
prosperous western Paris,

00:35:27.449 --> 00:35:31.891
prosperous western London,
prosperous center Vienna and

00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:35.134
other places,
and increasingly impoverished

00:35:35.134 --> 00:35:36.860
east and the periphery.
 

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.869
That's another theme.
 

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:41.768
Still, through much of the
period, and to a lesser extent

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:45.876
still today, where you live in a
building reflected how much

00:35:45.876 --> 00:35:47.130
money you had.
 

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.851
The ground floor,
in French the rez-de-chauss

00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:52.460
ée--this is the
concierge there.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.349
The concierge will be somebody
of very modest means.

00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:59.969
You'd probably place them in
the petty bourgeoisie there.

00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:03.947
Then the big apartment on the
first floor, high ceilings,

00:36:03.947 --> 00:36:07.284
big party, lots of people
dressed like me there,

00:36:07.284 --> 00:36:10.340
a piano, more about pianos in a
minute.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.730
So, this is my triangle upside
down, isn't it?

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.733
The more you go up there,
you're still within the middle

00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:18.170
class.
 

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:22.440
The guy above has these little
Napoleonic beds there.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.554
I hope he's not closing his
ears against his own baby

00:36:25.554 --> 00:36:28.130
there--but no,
obviously this is a different

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.730
house.
 

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.550
He's a musician.
 

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.780
This is all rather banal but
nonetheless telling.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.039
You've got an artist up here
with not much money,

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:36.016
but he still has a little bit
of furniture,

00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:38.699
not much, his nosey neighbor
looking at his painting.

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:41.561
Then on the top you've got the
poorest of them all,

00:36:41.561 --> 00:36:43.967
besides the cat who's on the
roof up there,

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:45.570
you've got a seamstress.
 

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.659
Anyone looking at this very
popular lithograph would

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:51.630
immediately see that she has
some dignity left.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.690
Why?
 

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.309
Because she has not yet pawned
her mattress.

00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:59.065
In Zola's great novel,
L'Assommoir,

00:36:59.065 --> 00:37:01.887
Gervaise dies like a dog on a
bed of straw,

00:37:01.887 --> 00:37:04.510
because there was no more
mattress.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:05.699
She must be at the very top.
 

00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:08.804
Now these rooms then became in
the twentieth century student

00:37:08.804 --> 00:37:12.280
rooms and then were transformed
into enormously expensive lofts.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.632
But this is a way of
visualizing the special

00:37:15.632 --> 00:37:18.829
concomitance of what I'm talking
about.

00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:21.268
People were aware of what these
symbols meant.

00:37:21.268 --> 00:37:28.010
This is your classic Hamburg
financier's apartment.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.610
We don't need to go on and on
about the kind of material

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.380
culture of wealth,
but there it is.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.311
Let's go on and on about it in
another one that's easier to

00:37:40.311 --> 00:37:41.829
pick up for your eyes there.
 

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:46.320
Here again, we know we're on
one of the lower floors.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.010
Why?
 

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.599
Because you see the trees
outside the window.

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:52.690
You've got a domesticated
animal.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.519
Ordinary people didn't have as
many domesticated--dogs had a

00:37:55.519 --> 00:37:56.239
real purpose.
 

00:37:56.239 --> 00:37:58.280
They bring the sheep down the
mountain.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.456
My wife just came down the
mountain two weeks ago bringing

00:38:00.456 --> 00:38:02.480
the sheep down from friends of
ours in the village.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.523
All these dogs are useful
things to keep the sheep in line

00:38:06.523 --> 00:38:07.800
and all of that.
 

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.230
This is all obvious stuff.
 

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.768
You've got slippers.
 

00:38:10.768 --> 00:38:12.519
Ordinary people did not wear
slippers.

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:14.380
You've got a domestic servant.
 

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.650
Domestic servants cost almost
nothing.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.724
It was considered to be a way
of moving up the ladder to say

00:38:19.724 --> 00:38:22.590
that you had four domestic
servants instead of three.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.719
You've got brass or copper here
on the heater.

00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:26.510
That's a good sign.
 

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.030
You've got very fancy chairs.
 

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.476
Look, these are very good
chairs, sort of Louis-Philippe

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:32.039
chairs.
 

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:35.724
You've got print culture,
a big old porcelain plate above

00:38:35.724 --> 00:38:38.947
there, and you've got that
bourgeois accoutrement,

00:38:38.947 --> 00:38:39.869
the piano.
 

00:38:39.869 --> 00:38:46.219
The piano replaces the
harpsichord.

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:50.389
Leon Plantinga,
who is in J.E. College,

00:38:50.389 --> 00:38:51.800
who's a retired professor of
music,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.137
has got great stuff on this,
the role of the piano and the

00:38:55.137 --> 00:39:01.059
emergence,
along with William Weber,

00:39:01.059 --> 00:39:06.061
who taught at Long Beach,
the emergence of the public

00:39:06.061 --> 00:39:08.416
concert,
as opposed to the chateau

00:39:08.416 --> 00:39:11.380
concert or the church concert,
the public concert.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.280
Along with that comes the piano.
 

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.896
Pianos were expensive,
but the middle class has

00:39:15.896 --> 00:39:16.409
pianos.
 

00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:18.070
Working people don't have
pianos.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.760
Middle-class people have pianos.
 

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.769
You also see something else
that's important here.

00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:23.619
There's more than one room.
 

00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:25.840
You'll see in a minute there's
even more than two rooms.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.579
There are lots of rooms.
 

00:39:27.579 --> 00:39:30.711
What the middle class wants,
all those people in that

00:39:30.711 --> 00:39:32.519
triangle, they want privacy.
 

00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:34.019
They want privacy.
 

00:39:34.019 --> 00:39:36.519
They want their own rooms.
 

00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:39.119
She's playing the piano.
 

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:40.070
It's all obvious stuff.
 

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.809
There's the kitchen.
 

00:39:41.809 --> 00:39:43.210
This is not the wife.
 

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.938
This is the domestic with her
children, who are part of the

00:39:47.938 --> 00:39:52.260
team who has been hired to help
run this household.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.610
There again you see the trees.
 

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.110
We're in the same apartment
there.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.170
You have real, real copper pots.
 

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.742
Back before the Bush dollar,
people would buy,

00:40:01.742 --> 00:40:06.429
bring back from Paris and from
Europe these enormously heavy

00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:07.699
copper pots.
 

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.119
I've carried so many of them
back.

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:09.989
It's just incredible.
 

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:15.519
Ordinary people did not cook
with things like that.

00:40:15.519 --> 00:40:17.449
There we go.
 

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:21.750
These are the kinds of symbols
of all of this.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.255
The middle class wants privacy
and they also developed

00:40:26.255 --> 00:40:27.699
something else.
 

00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:30.934
This is almost trite to say,
because so many people have

00:40:30.934 --> 00:40:32.980
said it and it can be
exaggerated,

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:37.905
but the middle class arguably
helps create the notion of

00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:38.980
childhood.
 

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.173
In many early-modern paintings
children are portrayed as sort

00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:46.949
of little squished up adults and
that sort of thing.

00:40:46.949 --> 00:40:50.119
Children come into their own in
the nineteenth century.

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:54.632
Ordinary peasants' children,
everybody slept with the

00:40:54.632 --> 00:40:57.929
animals often along with the
adults.

00:40:57.929 --> 00:41:02.724
Most ordinary people--and some
of the worst tenements in Europe

00:41:02.724 --> 00:41:06.010
were in Edinburgh,
and in Glasgow,

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.965
and in Lille in France,
but also in Berlin and lots of

00:41:09.965 --> 00:41:10.380
places.
 

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.250
There were no secrets.
 

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.239
Everybody slept in the same
room.

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:14.690
There were no secrets at all.
 

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:18.641
What the middle class wants,
besides social mobility and

00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:22.090
access to political power,
is they want space.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.552
The notion of childhood,
childhood didn't exist for

00:41:25.552 --> 00:41:26.800
ordinary people.
 

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.452
You started working,
helping out when you were five

00:41:29.452 --> 00:41:30.460
or six years old.
 

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.427
You started tending the animals
in the little courtyard as they

00:41:34.427 --> 00:41:37.052
would call it,
taking care of chickens and

00:41:37.052 --> 00:41:39.230
rabbits, and things like that.
 

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.097
Working people,
their children went to work

00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:43.320
right away, as soon as they
could make anything.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.603
If they were poor and didn't
have jobs, then they were sent

00:41:46.603 --> 00:41:47.340
out to beg.
 

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.199
Childhood became a middle class
phenomenon.

00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:54.027
To be sure, nobles had
children, but it was a different

00:41:54.027 --> 00:41:55.860
way of bringing up your
children.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:00.585
Nobles did not send their
children to public schools or

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:02.860
even to private schools.
 

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.344
They were educated,
to some extent at least,

00:42:07.344 --> 00:42:09.429
by private tutors.
 

00:42:09.429 --> 00:42:13.139
Even the notion of the
children's hour,

00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:16.329
the children's room,
the idea of a children's room,

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:18.920
of having your own room or a
room shared with a sibling,

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.539
was something that was just
inconceivable for the majority

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:24.190
of Europeans,
the vast,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.809
vast majority of Europeans.
 

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:29.623
The children's hour--I can even
remember the horror show of

00:42:29.623 --> 00:42:31.659
being summoned for the
children's hour,

00:42:31.659 --> 00:42:33.849
when you're supposed to come
out when there were guests and

00:42:33.849 --> 00:42:36.114
run through your extraordinarily
modest bag of tricks for the

00:42:36.114 --> 00:42:36.530
guests.
 

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.230
Then you would be sent sort of
packing.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.420
Since I couldn't play a note on
the piano,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.115
I had been expelled from piano
after two weeks and sent back to

00:42:46.115 --> 00:42:49.980
the playing fields by a nun in
Portland, Oregon,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.010
I didn't have many tricks to
show.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.849
But the children's hour,
all of this stuff comes out of

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:57.199
the middle class.
 

00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:58.389
How about birth control?
 

00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:02.929
How about not having ten or
eleven children?

00:43:02.929 --> 00:43:06.025
We have friends,
one of whom unfortunately just

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:09.994
died, very older friends who
were born in the early 1930s in

00:43:09.994 --> 00:43:11.610
the south of France.
 

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.809
One had thirteen brothers and
sisters, and the other eleven.

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:16.449
They grew up in absolute misery.
 

00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:19.061
They were a very,
very Catholic family in the

00:43:19.061 --> 00:43:20.190
center of France.
 

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:23.170
The middle class,
particularly the French middle

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.280
class, start reducing their
number of children.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.797
France is a particular case
because they get rid of--you

00:43:30.797 --> 00:43:34.000
could get around it by
primogeniture.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.326
The plot of land has to be
divided up into two,

00:43:36.326 --> 00:43:38.349
or three, or four,
or five, or twelve.

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:39.940
What if you own no land?
 

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.360
Not so good.
 

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.000
So, they begin having 2.2
children or something like that.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.119
Birth control--in some parts of
Europe people think that birth

00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:50.985
control really started with
peasants and then moves up to

00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:52.929
the upper classes,
but basically,

00:43:52.929 --> 00:43:55.570
particularly in the case of
France where it's been,

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.010
like most things,
studied to death,

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.268
birth control really begins
with the middle classes.

00:44:00.268 --> 00:44:04.949
They are limiting their
children so that their children

00:44:04.949 --> 00:44:08.900
can be the son of,
and inherit the business and

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.780
hopefully be left with enough
money to make it go.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.849
A print culture.
 

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:15.000
That was just an example.
 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.858
The whole salon,
the idea of going to see art

00:44:18.858 --> 00:44:19.559
shows.
 

00:44:19.559 --> 00:44:21.179
It really starts in the
eighteenth century.

00:44:21.179 --> 00:44:24.655
The middle class wants to be
seen rather like the Dutch

00:44:24.655 --> 00:44:27.936
middle class that we talked
about in the seventeenth

00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:28.710
century.
 

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.360
They want to be seen having
paintings.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.929
They wait in line to go to
theatres.

00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:34.320
This is all Daumier.
 

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.260
This is the morceau,
the piece that you're obliged

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.018
to swallow after dinner.
 

00:44:43.018 --> 00:44:47.885
Here's the little girl being
trotted out to play a few notes

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:53.079
for the quite bored people who
are sitting there and waiting.

00:44:53.079 --> 00:44:57.840
Even the idea of "It's
your birthday,

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.349
papa."
 

00:44:59.349 --> 00:45:01.831
You didn't take time out to
celebrate a birthday if you were

00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:04.353
an ordinary person having to get
to the fields at 4:00 in the

00:45:04.353 --> 00:45:08.940
morning in the summer,
or going to work during the day.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:14.300
The culture of childhood is
really all there.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:19.023
Also, there's a whole notion,
and here again this would

00:45:19.023 --> 00:45:21.623
probably fit rather awkwardly
into the birth control

00:45:21.623 --> 00:45:24.409
description,
but there's this whole sense of

00:45:24.409 --> 00:45:27.650
being prepared that emerges with
the middle class.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.672
One of those sort of
accoutrements--I once,

00:45:29.672 --> 00:45:31.693
when I gave the equivalent of
this lecture,

00:45:31.693 --> 00:45:33.380
I had an old battered umbrella.
 

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.427
I was trying to explain how
people on the top rung were

00:45:35.427 --> 00:45:37.059
trying to beat down people at
the bottom.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:42.059
I ended up smashing this
umbrella, sort of the imaginary

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.059
of somebody smashing their
guitar onstage.

00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:49.751
But the point is that the
umbrellas come with the middle

00:45:49.751 --> 00:45:50.289
class.
 

00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:51.599
They are black umbrellas.
 

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.780
They're not these big colored
things you have now.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.960
It was the idea of protecting
that one suit.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.989
I'm from Oregon.
 

00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:58.838
We didn't carry umbrellas,
because it rained all the time

00:45:58.838 --> 00:45:59.829
anyway and I'd just lose it.
 

00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:03.559
Umbrellas are middle-class
accoutrements along with the

00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:06.599
piano and along with the
children's room,

00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:09.199
and along with the children's
hour,

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:12.110
and along with the idea of not
having too many children,

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:17.382
and along with the top hat,
and with the idea of wanting

00:46:17.382 --> 00:46:21.400
access to information through
the newspapers,

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.295
wanting the right to vote,
probably not wanting those

00:46:24.295 --> 00:46:26.570
people down below you on the
ladder to vote,

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.530
but demanding that you have the
right to vote.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.530
They all shared these things in
common.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.469
Lastly--gazing at his watch--in
the last one minute thirty-five

00:46:36.469 --> 00:46:39.920
seconds that remains to me,
the bourgeoisie,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.054
the middle classes,
and this is particularly true

00:46:43.054 --> 00:46:46.059
of Germany and France,
and of England,

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:48.353
too,
and of other places--they want

00:46:48.353 --> 00:46:49.670
the right to bear arms.
 

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.539
They want to be in the national
guard.

00:46:51.539 --> 00:46:56.737
The national guard might
hypothetically be there in case

00:46:56.737 --> 00:47:00.989
there was an invasion of France
or Germany by,

00:47:00.989 --> 00:47:04.530
I don't know,
some distant place,

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.909
the Fins or something most
unlikely.

00:47:06.909 --> 00:47:09.998
But the main reason they wanted
to join the national guard--and

00:47:09.998 --> 00:47:12.690
you had to own property to be in
the national guard.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.027
You had to be defined as a
property-owning citizen to have

00:47:16.027 --> 00:47:17.199
the right to vote.
 

00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:19.989
In all of these countries the
right to vote was defined,

00:47:19.989 --> 00:47:22.380
until you have universal male
suffrage,

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.690
by how much taxes you paid and
how much property you own.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.815
You can measure where you are
on this ladder by how much taxes

00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:31.559
you paid.
 

00:47:31.559 --> 00:47:35.753
They didn't want to pay a lot
of taxes, but property reflects

00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:38.619
one's belief in one's own social
worth.

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:40.119
That's the way they looked at
it.

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:43.090
No longer was it the worth of
blood.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.717
So, they formed these national
guards, particularly after

00:47:46.717 --> 00:47:49.570
revolutions and after 1848,
or after 1830.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.539
For a while they go march
around.

00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:55.670
But these are mainly there to
protect them against the

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.449
workers.
 

00:47:56.449 --> 00:47:59.257
Should one day all of these
people try to rise up,

00:47:59.257 --> 00:48:02.125
climb up this ladder,
you'll be down there to stomp

00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:04.590
on their fingers or to shoot
them down.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.210
It doesn't last very long.
 

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:08.800
Pretty soon, this guy's tired.
 

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.369
This isn't Daumier.
 

00:48:09.369 --> 00:48:09.940
I don't know who it is.
 

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.469
It doesn't matter.
 

00:48:10.469 --> 00:48:11.429
It's not very good.
 

00:48:11.429 --> 00:48:13.000
He's had it.
 

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.900
He's freezing.
 

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.967
His wife is kind of looking at
him like, "I don't know why

00:48:16.967 --> 00:48:19.588
you're doing this stuff,
marching around in the middle

00:48:19.588 --> 00:48:20.429
of the night.
 

00:48:20.429 --> 00:48:21.849
No one's going to rise up
anyway."

00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:23.349
This won't last.
 

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:25.730
His old blunderbuss there on
the let will be put back in the

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.989
closet, or taken out to slay
deer, or some damn thing.

00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:33.269
That will be the end of it and
they'll turn it over to more

00:48:33.269 --> 00:48:37.639
professional repressive forces
such as armies.

00:48:37.639 --> 00:48:41.110
Daumier's light lines,
and this is the last one,

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:45.186
disappear in this painting,
which is called the Rue

00:48:45.186 --> 00:48:47.369
Transnonain,
April 15,

00:48:47.369 --> 00:48:49.079
1934-don't write it down,
in Paris.

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:50.480
It's a street that no longer
exists.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.369
It disappeared when Haussmann
built the boulevards in the

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:54.300
1850s and 1860s.
 

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.597
It was selected to disappear
because it recalled an event in

00:48:58.597 --> 00:49:02.530
the early 1830s when these
bourgeois panicked and start

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:06.681
going into a house full of very
ordinary people and simply

00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:08.429
shooting them all.
 

00:49:08.429 --> 00:49:11.849
The light lines disappear with
Daumier.

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:14.768
He did another one of these
after a massacre in 1848 in

00:49:14.768 --> 00:49:16.230
Rouen and it's been lost.
 

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:17.090
We don't have it.
 

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.760
Rue Transnonain.
 

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.380
H.D. Daumier at the bottom
left.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.572
The middle classes,
for all of their insistence

00:49:26.572 --> 00:49:29.018
that they have access to
information,

00:49:29.018 --> 00:49:33.849
at least in the case of France
they cheered on a press law in

00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:38.438
1835 that kept Daumier from
touching political scenes such

00:49:38.438 --> 00:49:41.980
as this which were deemed too
sensitive.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.630
The rue Transnonain,
where this happened in the

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.820
center of Paris,
simply disappeared.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.057
It didn't quite disappear from
the collective memory of people

00:49:50.057 --> 00:49:51.809
thinking about Parisian things.
 

00:49:51.809 --> 00:49:55.512
In conclusion,
the middle classes extremely

00:49:55.512 --> 00:49:56.130
vary.
 

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:57.150
They share much.
 

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.719
They have a common material
culture.

00:50:00.719 --> 00:50:05.322
They share a belief in achieved
status, as measured by the

00:50:05.322 --> 00:50:08.070
amount of property that you had.
 

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.559
They want to vote.
 

00:50:09.559 --> 00:50:14.730
They want a collective voice in
decisions.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:19.110
For all the variety within the
middle classes,

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.173
so beautifully depicted by
Daumier and other people,

00:50:23.173 --> 00:50:26.070
they still,
when push came to shove,

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.889
shared an awful lot in the
bourgeois century,

00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:32.880
that of the nineteenth century.
 

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.510
Have a good weekend.
 

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.000
See you on Monday.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.507
Marx is cited that once he
said, "I am not a

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.960
Marxist."
 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.690
And I think there is a lot of
truth to it.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.870
The reason why I carry on and
on and on with Marx,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.817
in this course,
because my experience is that

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:28.440
many of us do have very
simplistic stereotypes,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.587
in our mind,
who Karl Marx was and what his

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:34.760
theory is all about.
 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.537
Well he was a creative scholar,
a vibrant mind,

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:45.352
who was ready to change his
mind when confronted with new

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:50.130
arguments or confronted with new
evidence.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.964
And there were many,
many facets,

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.080
many faces of Karl Marx.
 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.867
We have seen some of those.
 

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.590
Right?
 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.381
We have seen Marx,
starting as a Hegelian

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:07.093
idealist,
being obsessed with the idea of

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:11.218
alienation,
disappointed with Hegel's

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:16.686
fluffy idea of alienation,
bringing it closer to home,

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:20.700
bringing it more down to earth,
making probably some

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.230
reductionist mistake in the
process,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.956
then abandoning it and turning
into a materialist somewhat

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.379
hesitantly and reluctantly.
 

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:38.516
When he starts his turn towards
historical materialism in

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.729
"The Theses on
Feuerbach,"

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.500
he says: "The point is to
change the world.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.340
Truth is a practical
question."

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.483
Within six months,
in The German Ideology,

00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:57.506
he is a positivist social
scientist.

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:58.370
Right?
 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.444
The point where we start with
our real individual and our real

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.938
actual social circumstances.
 

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:10.677
He offers testable hypotheses,
to put it this way,

00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:14.158
in modern social science
language.

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:20.955
And in some ways he remains a
positivist social scientist,

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.460
in his major works.
 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.258
So he was changing his mind,
and indeed he was less

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:32.098
doctrinaire than usually
Marxists are.

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:35.854
And easy to be less
doctrinaire--right?--if you are

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:39.310
one of the persons who created
the doctrine.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.272
Today we will be talking about
one important component of

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:47.729
Marx's theory,
his theory of history.

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.924
And this is also contradictory,
full with tensions and

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:53.270
contradictions.
 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.520
But it is a formidable body of
propositions;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.210
absolutely formidable.
 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.538
There is actually not a single
theorist I can recall who,

00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:11.227
like Karl Marx,
not only has a very specific

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:16.348
set of ideas in what stages
human evolution,

00:03:16.348 --> 00:03:20.328
from the very elementary
societies to the most complex

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:21.378
one evolved.
 

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:24.520
There are many who offer
typologies like this.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.000
We have seen in Montesquieu,
we have seen in Adam Smith;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.530
there were many who did that.
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.887
But what is unique about Marx,
that he has a genuine theory of

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:40.930
history.
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.658
He has a very powerful argument
what is the exact causal

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:52.077
mechanism which leads the
transition from one form of

00:03:52.077 --> 00:03:56.916
society to another one;
what drives historical

00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:57.930
evolution.
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.639
Marx is genuinely the Darwin of
social scientists,

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.370
in this respect.
 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.787
What Darwin could do with
The Evolution of Species,

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:14.539
Marx was capable to do in the
theory of history.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.970
It's a genuine theory. Right?
 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.009
A theory, when you have an idea
what are really the causal

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.899
mechanisms, what links cause to
an effect.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.959
And Marx has such a theory.
 

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:34.144
We will see when we will be
discussing Weber,

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:40.978
whom I admire a great deal,
that Weber really does not have

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:43.100
such a theory.
 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.379
And as far I can,
nobody else does.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.509
Well the only downside of
Marx's theory of history is that

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.480
history proved him to be wrong.
 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.470
Well theories are not
necessarily to be supported by

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.879
the facts.
 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.389
Theories are there,
you know, to have a tight

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.420
enough proposition and to be
tested.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.952
But what exactly the theory is
will vary in Marx's own

00:05:12.952 --> 00:05:16.785
writings,
and there are some versions of

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:22.209
this theory which fit better the
empirical reality than the

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:26.529
original one,
and the one which became kind

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.050
of carved into stone in the
literature on Marx.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:38.156
And this is why I do a little
comparison between The German

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:41.916
Ideology--
we touched upon The German

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:46.742
Ideology already--
and another manuscript that he

00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:50.839
also left incomplete and
unfinished.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:56.309
He was working on it in 1857
and '58, and was never properly

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.740
translated, the title into
English.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.367
We always refer it to
Grundrisse,

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:06.250
the 'eh' at the end,
the sounds.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.180
Right?
 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.850
English speakers like to call
it "Grundriss".

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.290
No, it is Grundrisse.
 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.459
And Grundrisse means a
sketch, an outline.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.769
And that's what it is.
 

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:23.055
One-thousand pages,
handwritten pages,

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:28.269
written in a big hurry between
'57 and '58.

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.620
Like the earlier attempts to
write a big book,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.819
The Paris Manuscript and
The German Ideology,

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:41.750
when Marx approaches the end of
his title he argued,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.089
theory--he said,
"My goodness gracious,

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:47.519
I got it all wrong.
 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.680
I have to start it all over
again."

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.699
And he will start all over
again, just in ten years' time,

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.449
and he will write Das
Kapital.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.610
Did he get it wrong in the
Grundrisse?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.399
That's what I will try to pose
today.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.310
And I was merciful enough that
I did not ask you to read too

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.139
much from the Grundrisse.
 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:18.415
What you read has been
published as a separate little

00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:24.086
book, under the title
Pre-Capitalist Economic

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:26.379
Formations.
 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.619
And this is probably the most
accessible text in the whole

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.550
one-thousand pages.
 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.043
It was put together and
translated by the wonderful

00:07:38.043 --> 00:07:41.819
British social historian,
Eric Hobsbawm.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.579
Fortunately he's still with us.
 

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:48.850
He's ninety-one-years-old,
and thanks God he's strong;

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.230
and he's still traveling,
if you pay him business class.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.050
But we could get him to this
class if Yale would be willing

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.790
to pay business class ticket,
but Yale would not do it.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.444
Anyway, he's sharp,
good, and he was the major

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:13.240
social historian of the
twentieth century in Britain--

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.906
not a trivial matter because
the best social history was in

00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:19.120
Britain in the twentieth
century.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.860
Anyway, he translated it,
and you read his translation.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.310
Was it difficult?
 

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.259
Yes.
 

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.177
But try the rest of the
Grundrisse,

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:30.329
and then you will see how easy
this text is.

00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:34.729
Okay, and the point what I'm
trying to make today is to show

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:38.904
what a fundamental shift there
is in Marx's thinking from

00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:43.080
The German Ideology to
the Grundrisse.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.001
So we will start with the
initial formulation in the

00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:52.634
Grundrisse,
how he's beginning to conceive

00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:55.820
what historical evolution is.
 

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.384
And this is something we did
cover, so I can rush through of

00:09:00.384 --> 00:09:01.623
it very quickly.
 

00:09:01.623 --> 00:09:02.320
Right?
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.418
The idea is--what he introduces
for the first time in The

00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:11.481
German Ideology,
1845--is the concept of the

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:13.470
mode of production.
 

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.884
And you already have seen this
citation.

00:09:17.884 --> 00:09:18.788
Right?
 

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:23.140
"Man can distinguish from
animals by consciousness,

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.990
by religion,
or anything you like.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.523
They, themselves begin to
distinguish themselves from

00:09:30.523 --> 00:09:34.360
animals as soon as they begin to
produce,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.335
as soon as they're beginning to
change the world to fit their

00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:39.659
human needs."
 

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:43.330
That is the fundamental insight.
 

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.956
And you may dismiss it but,
you know, that's clearly a very

00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:49.552
serious proposition.
 

00:09:49.552 --> 00:09:50.269
Right?
 

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:54.048
That if you look at history
over time, you will become very

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:56.590
interested how these people
survived.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.279
What did they eat?
 

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:00.649
How did they produce what they
did eat?

00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:03.298
What kind of housing did they
live in?

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:05.652
How they did build their
housing?

00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:06.240
Right?
 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.440
How they did move around?
 

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.328
Did they invent the wheel,
or did they already know the

00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:12.760
wheel?
 

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.408
Right?
 

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:16.044
These are the questions you
will be asking when you are

00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:17.070
studying a society.
 

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.912
Did they--could they lit a fire
or they couldn't?

00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:22.720
Right?
 

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.519
So you were interested in this
stuff.

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.067
How did they kill the deer?
 

00:10:27.067 --> 00:10:27.470
Right?
 

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.850
What kind of weapons they had.
 

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.346
What kind of instruments they
used when they planted their

00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:34.899
plants.
 

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:35.610
Right?
 

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.414
These are obvious questions to
ask, and he said,

00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:40.683
"That's it,
that's what we want to

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:41.519
see."
 

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.590
And he said,
"This mode of production

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.409
must be considered not simply as
reproduction."

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:49.158
Right?
 

00:10:49.158 --> 00:10:52.715
And I think this is a very
powerful argument,

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:54.491
what he makes it here.
 

00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.220
Right?
 

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.024
This is a definite mode of
life.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:58.750
Right?
 

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:04.474
When I'm suggesting mode of
production, I'm not narrowly

00:11:04.474 --> 00:11:07.178
focusing on the economy.
 

00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:10.928
I am basically talking about
differences in ways of life.

00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:14.634
And differences in ways of
life, as he elsewhere puts it,

00:11:14.634 --> 00:11:18.340
well first you have to drink
and eat and find shelter.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.208
And once you are not hungry any
longer, and you are not wet when

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:26.147
it is raining,
then you start thinking.

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:26.918
Right?
 

00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:31.909
But first you have to fill your
stomach--right?--and make sure

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:35.019
that you are safe from the
rainfall.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:37.720
That's a reasonable argument.
 

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.240
Well there are some very
important key differences,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.851
as we proceed from The
German Ideology to the

00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:48.840
Grundrisse.
 

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.870
Well in The German
Ideology there's one

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.928
important difference.
 

00:11:54.928 --> 00:11:58.710
History is driven by increasing
division of labor.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.009
And I pointed to this in the
earlier lecture.

00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:04.090
Here he draws directly on Adam
Smith.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.309
He basically takes it over from
Adam Smith.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:08.879
That's what Adam Smith did.
 

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:12.586
In the Grundrisse,
on the other hand,

00:12:12.586 --> 00:12:16.206
he sees a movement,
a gradual movement over

00:12:16.206 --> 00:12:19.570
history, towards private
ownership;

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.460
that's what drives the story.
 

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.756
"A gradual separation of
the laboring subject and the

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:29.000
objective conditions of the
worker."

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.340
That's how he describes now
human history.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.006
And doing so--separation of
laboring subject and the

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.793
objective conditions of labor--
enables him in the

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:44.350
Grundrisse to bring back
the notion of alienation.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.192
He already seemed to have
forgotten and put it on the

00:12:47.192 --> 00:12:47.629
shelf.
 

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:49.759
Then he will forget it again.
 

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.666
But for this piece of work,
the idea of alienation

00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:58.130
re-interpreted as the making of
private ownership and the

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.835
separation of worker and the
objective conditions of work is

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:05.649
very crucial,
very important.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:08.370
There is another big difference.
 

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.307
In The German Ideology,
Marx has a unilinear view of

00:13:13.307 --> 00:13:15.788
history;
a very deterministic,

00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:17.960
uni-linear view of history.
 

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.317
And this is what will come back
in later Marx,

00:13:21.317 --> 00:13:24.750
and that dominate Marxists of
various kinds.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.427
Uni-linear means--right?--that
all societies start at the same

00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:33.500
starting point:
tribal society.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.027
They all progress through
slavery, feudalism,

00:13:37.027 --> 00:13:41.756
capitalism, with the assumption
that they all will end up in

00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:42.879
communism.
 

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:47.038
But this is a kind of
uni-linear stage.

00:13:47.038 --> 00:13:50.850
Every society will have to go
through of these stages,

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.379
and there is necessity that one
moves from an earlier stage to a

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:56.529
later stage.
 

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:59.360
And as I said,
he will show the causal

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.808
mechanism how it is happening.
 

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.190
The Grundrisse is
different.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.046
This is a messy description of
human history,

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:12.769
a multi-linear trajectory;
and I will show you what his

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.038
multi-linear trajectory is.
 

00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:19.402
The beauty of shifting from
this uni-linear trajectory to

00:14:19.402 --> 00:14:22.440
the multi-linear trajectory is
that,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.629
though Marx messes completely
the logic of argument up,

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:32.773
but he produces a theoretical
proposition what you can see

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:37.349
fits already in his time,
the historical development,

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:39.490
very well,
and would argue by

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.500
extension--now I will extend his
argument--

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.168
it even fits better later
historical evolution.

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:50.812
Okay, let's return now to
The German Ideology

00:14:50.812 --> 00:14:56.639
briefly, and the centrality of
division of labor in this work.

00:14:56.639 --> 00:15:03.332
Well, Marx described--right?--a
mode of production between the

00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:08.490
dialectical interaction between
what he saw,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.306
he called forces of
production--and forces of

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:16.210
production means basically the
technology,

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.412
raw materials,
the labor power--and eventually

00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.470
he invents a term,
the relations of production.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:32.474
But he identifies this with
property relations in the later

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:33.320
work.
 

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.971
But he tends to use the word
'intercourse' or 'division of

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:42.840
labor' in The German
Ideology.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.070
Now dialectical interaction.
 

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.129
What on earth this word means?
 

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:56.399
I think I also mentioned once
that Marx,

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:00.538
in a letter to Engels,
once wrote: "You know,

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:03.647
when I don't understand
something, then I say it is

00:16:03.647 --> 00:16:04.889
dialectical."
 

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:11.051
So the idea of dialectics was
not much clearer to Karl Marx

00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:12.962
than it is to you.
 

00:16:12.962 --> 00:16:13.918
Right?
 

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:18.501
But dialectics basically
meant--right?--an interactive

00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:19.798
relationship.
 

00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:24.529
You know, in today's social
science language we would

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:30.169
say--right?--that there is the
causal arrow going in both ways.

00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:31.080
Right?
 

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.567
It's not simply that relations
of production determine

00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:36.279
relations of production.
 

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:41.298
Certain relations of production
can block the development of

00:16:41.298 --> 00:16:44.806
forces of production,
and when they change,

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:49.065
the new relations of production
can unleash the development of

00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:51.019
the forces of production.
 

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:53.500
So that is the
dialectics--right?--

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.216
that the causal arrow,
there is not simple

00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:59.399
determination pointing from one
to the other,

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:01.428
but there is a feedback loop.
 

00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:01.918
Right?
 

00:17:01.918 --> 00:17:05.498
That would be,
I think, the modern social

00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:08.720
science language,
to put this one.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:14.048
As I said, in the initial
formulation, he really thinks

00:17:14.048 --> 00:17:18.982
this is the division of labor,
rather than property

00:17:18.982 --> 00:17:20.759
relationships.
 

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:26.386
And I think we have seen it,
he will--this comes straight

00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:30.105
out of Adam Smith,
what you have read.

00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:31.108
Right?
 

00:17:31.108 --> 00:17:34.819
The relations of different
nations among themselves depends

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:38.338
to which each has developed
these productive forces,

00:17:38.338 --> 00:17:42.318
the division of labor and its
internal intercourse.

00:17:42.318 --> 00:17:45.529
So that's exactly--right?--what
Adam Smith said.

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:48.759
Hunting/gathering societies,
grazing societies,

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:51.920
agricultural societies,
commercial societies,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.699
they all correspond to
different levels of division of

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:56.269
labor.
 

00:17:56.269 --> 00:18:00.201
And that's what Marx initially
tries to do in The German

00:18:00.201 --> 00:18:01.220
Ideology.
 

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:09.880
And he deals with the question
of the property relations,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.621
but he said,
"Look, property relations

00:18:12.621 --> 00:18:15.405
also change,
but these changing property

00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:18.682
relations are simply the
outcomes of the increased

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.490
division of labor."
 

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.220
So it's basically determined by
the division of labor.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.891
"If I understand the level
of division of labor,

00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:30.818
I will understand property
relationships as well."

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.960
That sounds actually quite
reasonable.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.730
And these sections of The
German Ideology,

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.308
by the way, were rediscovered
by Marxists in the 1950s,

00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:48.220
especially Marxists who were
living in the Soviet Empire.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:54.720
There was a formidable social
scientist in Poland;

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.759
his name is Ossowski.
 

00:18:56.759 --> 00:19:04.780
And Ossowski,
in 1957, re-read The German

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.578
Ideology.
 

00:19:07.578 --> 00:19:10.695
And until then,
you know, what was carved into

00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:12.294
stone,
that, you know,

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:16.191
Marxist theory suggests that
this is property relations which

00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:17.618
explain everything.
 

00:19:17.618 --> 00:19:22.190
And that was the
project--right?--of communism.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:26.557
You eliminate private ownership
and everything will be fine.

00:19:26.557 --> 00:19:27.150
Right?
 

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.211
No private ownership,
things will be rosy.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.808
Right?
 

00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:34.449
There will be equality among
people--right?--and dynamic

00:19:34.449 --> 00:19:35.640
economic growth.
 

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.180
Now the Soviets eliminated
private ownership.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.569
Was it an egalitarian society?
 

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:42.890
No it wasn't.
 

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.769
Was it a dynamic society?
 

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:45.900
No it wasn't.
 

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.402
Now Ossowski was re-reading
The German Ideology and

00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:54.509
said, "Well you did not
read your Marx right.

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:58.124
Marx doesn't say it is property
relations which is crucial,

00:19:58.124 --> 00:19:59.618
but division of labor.
 

00:19:59.618 --> 00:20:02.961
So, of course,
the division of labor exists in

00:20:02.961 --> 00:20:07.009
a Communist society,
just not the appropriate

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:10.102
division of labor,
and that creates

00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:11.528
inequalities."
 

00:20:11.528 --> 00:20:15.970
Anyway, that was a very
interesting debate.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:21.816
Ossowski had a very great
reception in western social

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:23.838
science circles.
 

00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:28.124
Okay, anyway so this is the
initial idea--right?--in The

00:20:28.124 --> 00:20:29.750
German Ideology.
 

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.490
And then he proceeds,
as again we have seen it.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.460
I'll rush through of it.
 

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.244
He describes various modes of
production this way.

00:20:38.244 --> 00:20:38.700
Right?
 

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:44.550
There is the tribal
society--very primitive means of

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:49.368
production: hunting,
fishing, gathering.

00:20:49.368 --> 00:20:52.548
Division of labor is very
elementary.

00:20:52.548 --> 00:20:57.298
And he uses this sexist term:
"This is only a natural

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.798
division of labor between men
and women.

00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:04.715
Women gather and men hunts,
because the men are strong and,

00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:07.213
as you know,
the women are weak."

00:21:07.213 --> 00:21:07.890
Right?
 

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.265
And therefore this is a
"natural division of

00:21:11.265 --> 00:21:12.250
labor."
 

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.089
Well probably he can be
forgiven;

00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:18.299
I mean, he wrote this in 1845.
 

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:21.400
And then he moves on to slavery.
 

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.901
He said, "Well now the
forces of production are

00:21:23.901 --> 00:21:25.028
beginning to develop.
 

00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:31.400
In a tribal society people just
had enough capacity to gather,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.750
hunt, and fish enough food to
survive,

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.440
and therefore everybody had to
go out gathering,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.259
hunting, and fishing.
 

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:42.330
But now we have new
technologies,

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.567
which are more productive,
and therefore it becomes

00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:49.063
possible that some people say,
'Well I am not going out

00:21:49.063 --> 00:21:49.970
hunting.
 

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:55.659
I will get slaves,
and slaves will do the work for

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:56.240
me.
 

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.948
They will be able to produce
what is necessary for their

00:22:00.948 --> 00:22:01.890
survival.
 

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.605
I'll give them only as much
that they do not die from

00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:06.250
hunger.
 

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.351
I eat the rest,
and drink the rest,

00:22:09.351 --> 00:22:13.547
and then I'll just sit at home
and I am writing

00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:17.924
philosophy.'"
So ancient philosophy is born.

00:22:17.924 --> 00:22:19.019
Right?
 

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:21.642
You're Plato,
sitting at home,

00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:26.561
and thinking,
and you are writing drama and

00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:28.875
poetry,
and you create art,

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:31.740
because the slaves are working
the fields,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.400
producing a surplus that can be
appropriated from them.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.150
Division of labor increases as
technology increased.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.229
Well as a result,
some change in property

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:44.307
relationships.
 

00:22:44.307 --> 00:22:45.000
Right?
 

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.617
Now this is not a communal
relationship,

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:51.175
we are not members of the same
community, but a pretty

00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:55.069
oppressive relationship between
slave and slave owner.

00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:56.328
And he goes on.
 

00:22:56.328 --> 00:22:58.557
And then comes feudalism,
and what happens with

00:22:58.557 --> 00:22:59.140
feudalism?
 

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:04.230
Well what is the problem with
the slaves?

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.794
The problem with the slaves,
that they have absolutely no

00:23:08.794 --> 00:23:10.750
interest in producing.
 

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.420
They were simply physically
coursed to produce.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.666
Therefore they can be pretty
negligent in operating the means

00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:19.799
of instrument.
 

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:22.788
You have to supervise them.
 

00:23:22.788 --> 00:23:25.748
You beat them--right?--to make
them work.

00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:26.338
Right?
 

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:30.029
You keep killing them,
you know, if they disobey.

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:33.038
There's struggle;
you know, you have to conduct

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.430
wars all the time--right?--to
get new slaves.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.672
Therefore as technology
develops, you need a labor force

00:23:40.672 --> 00:23:44.578
which is more motivated to work
harder.

00:23:44.578 --> 00:23:50.220
So slaves are being replaced by
serfs, by peasants.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.779
And what is the big change?
 

00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:56.390
The big change is that now the
peasants will get a plot they

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.500
can cultivate themselves.
 

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.144
They actually have to work only
for two or three days on the

00:24:03.144 --> 00:24:08.339
large estate of the feudal lord,
and the rest of the time they

00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:12.500
can stay at home,
cultivate their land.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.980
They can build a house.
 

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.868
They can have their family.
 

00:24:15.868 --> 00:24:18.632
They can marry,
and their children will belong

00:24:18.632 --> 00:24:20.596
to them, rather than to the
lord.

00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:21.210
Right?
 

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.670
A big change. Right?
 

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.656
In classical states of slavery,
the children--there are no

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:29.231
marriage, no home.
 

00:24:29.231 --> 00:24:30.019
Right?
 

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:33.519
Slaves lives in barracks. Right?
 

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:36.088
The institution of family does
not exist.

00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:39.420
I mean, you know,
slavery in the south of the

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.130
United States was not quite
classical slavery,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.250
in Greece and Rome or in Egypt,
but had some similarities.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:47.828
Right?
 

00:24:47.828 --> 00:24:52.970
Slave owners certainly had
claim on the children of slaves,

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.150
and in many instances marriage
was really--

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.589
not really an existing
institution,

00:24:59.589 --> 00:25:03.118
even in nineteenth century U.S.
 

00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:05.328
Now the serfs are very
different.

00:25:05.328 --> 00:25:07.759
They have their family,
they have their home.

00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:11.054
They do not have a title of the
land and the home,

00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:14.548
but they have possession of the
land and the home.

00:25:14.548 --> 00:25:18.048
And therefore they have an
interest.

00:25:18.048 --> 00:25:20.952
If they don't work hard on
those two days,

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:25.201
on the land of the landlords,
they are kicked off their land.

00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:25.910
Right?
 

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.509
So therefore they will have to
pay more attention.

00:25:29.509 --> 00:25:31.778
That's the idea.
 

00:25:31.778 --> 00:25:37.705
But then he looks at--you know,
compares--the Dark Middle Ages

00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:43.632
in Europe--right?--the peaks of
feudalism with Rome and Greece

00:25:43.632 --> 00:25:45.088
and Athens.
 

00:25:45.088 --> 00:25:48.458
And he said,
"Did the division of labor

00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.788
increase?"
 

00:25:49.788 --> 00:25:53.402
He said, "No they,
the division of labor

00:25:53.402 --> 00:25:54.880
decreased."
 

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.786
I mean antiquity,
that was discovered in the

00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:03.420
Renaissance, was far superior to
the Middle Ages.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.259
The big cities,
like Rome, were abandoned.

00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:08.700
Many of you were in Rome.
 

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.660
Even now you see ruins. Right?
 

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.612
The glorious Rome--right?--was
left as a grazing land for the

00:26:17.612 --> 00:26:18.207
sheep.
 

00:26:18.207 --> 00:26:19.098
Right?
 

00:26:19.098 --> 00:26:26.307
Those lands--you know,
they could bring water into

00:26:26.307 --> 00:26:27.925
your homes.
 

00:26:27.925 --> 00:26:29.250
Right?
 

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.358
The Greeks.
 

00:26:30.358 --> 00:26:31.940
They had high levels of
technologies.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.920
They had highly developed
industries.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.788
This was all forgotten in the
Middle Ages.

00:26:37.788 --> 00:26:38.349
Right?
 

00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:41.029
So what is the Middle Ages?
 

00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:44.574
Some people said this was a
step backward historically.

00:26:44.574 --> 00:26:45.098
Right?
 

00:26:45.098 --> 00:26:48.248
Inquisition,
the Dark Middle Ages,

00:26:48.248 --> 00:26:53.009
the decay of the cities;
it's a step backward.

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:55.461
Well Marx doesn't know what to
do with it.

00:26:55.461 --> 00:26:55.940
Right?
 

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.559
And as I said-- pointed out,
he abandons the manuscript

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:00.028
here.
 

00:27:00.028 --> 00:27:03.598
He said, "Well the theory
doesn't work.

00:27:03.598 --> 00:27:06.663
I cannot explain this all with
increasing division of

00:27:06.663 --> 00:27:07.490
labor."
 

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.961
Then, of course,
would be-- the fourth mode

00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:14.410
should be capitalism.
 

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.721
And as he's beginning to
develop the form of capitalism,

00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:23.034
he's beginning to develop now
the notion of relations of

00:27:23.034 --> 00:27:24.210
production.
 

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:29.009
Really feudalism is
superior--this idea comes up in

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:34.078
The German Ideology--
superior to the Middle Ages

00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:38.618
because it had more developed
relations of production,

00:27:38.618 --> 00:27:40.348
more developed property
relations.

00:27:40.348 --> 00:27:43.650
It was a further step towards
private ownership.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:50.700
It was a further step because
now the laborer had possessions

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.930
of the land, what they
cultivated.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:01.016
Well and here it comes,
the classical Marxist view,

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:06.371
what he will change in the
Grundrisse,

00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:09.778
about historical change.
 

00:28:09.778 --> 00:28:13.034
And this is,
I think, a provocative,

00:28:13.034 --> 00:28:15.740
important statement;
that he said,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.130
"If I'm looking at a mode
of production,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.751
we can characterize them by the
correspondence of the forces and

00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:24.660
relations of production.
 

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:30.308
A certain level of forces of
production require a certain

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:35.824
type of relations of production,
a certain type of relationship

00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:37.608
between individuals."
 

00:28:37.608 --> 00:28:42.603
This is, in Marx,
what a hundred years later in

00:28:42.603 --> 00:28:47.380
social sciences were called
structuralism.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.295
This is a typical structuralist
statement.

00:28:51.295 --> 00:28:52.058
Right?
 

00:28:52.058 --> 00:28:56.212
That you have correspondences
of the different elements of the

00:28:56.212 --> 00:29:01.220
system you are analyzing--
a correspondence of the forces

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.630
and the relations of production.
 

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.160
And then he goes further.
 

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.238
And now we will begin to see
how he develops the causal

00:29:12.238 --> 00:29:13.900
mechanism of change.
 

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.117
He says, "There is the
development of forces of

00:29:18.117 --> 00:29:19.690
production."
 

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.934
To use the term of contemporary
Marxist Eric Olin Wright,

00:29:25.934 --> 00:29:29.170
is "sticky down."
 

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.970
Sticky down means that the
forces of production can only

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.490
become more complex.
 

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.298
You don't forget--actually it's
not true, but that's the

00:29:38.298 --> 00:29:42.039
theory--you don't forget more
advanced technologies.

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:44.710
Technology is always advancing.
 

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.550
But the growing,
evolving technology eventually

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:55.338
gets into conflict with the
relations of production,

00:29:55.338 --> 00:29:59.106
between the property
relationships and social

00:29:59.106 --> 00:30:01.420
relationships in society.
 

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.068
They become outdated.
 

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:07.358
So outdated because,
as I pointed out,

00:30:07.358 --> 00:30:12.025
the slaves were not
sufficiently attentive to

00:30:12.025 --> 00:30:15.154
technology,
and the serfs were more

00:30:15.154 --> 00:30:18.160
attentive but not sufficiently
attentive.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.722
The serfs were not-- did not
have such high incentives to

00:30:22.722 --> 00:30:27.450
work very hard with complex
technologies than you guys will

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.813
be when you will be in a job.
 

00:30:29.813 --> 00:30:30.710
Right?
 

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.750
Because you will be highly paid
and highly skilled.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.798
You will have fringe benefits,
and you don't want to be fired.

00:30:36.798 --> 00:30:37.200
Right?
 

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.288
And you will put your skills to
use,

00:30:40.288 --> 00:30:43.000
and therefore you will be able
to use very--

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.596
with great care,
that the computers you use are

00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:51.430
not being damaged,
as you are using them. Right?

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.787
So therefore you have to become
a wage laborer to have these

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.890
very high incentives to work
very hard,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:05.269
and to be very careful with the
instruments what you are using.

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:11.028
And then he says therefore what
happens that eventually these

00:31:11.028 --> 00:31:16.594
outmoded social relationships
become in a conflict with the

00:31:16.594 --> 00:31:20.900
forces of production,
and we want to have more.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.036
We want to have development.
 

00:31:23.036 --> 00:31:23.568
Right?
 

00:31:23.568 --> 00:31:28.353
And therefore at one point
there will become a tension

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:32.529
between the outmoded,
outlived, old relations of

00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:36.473
production and the need to
create new spaces for the

00:31:36.473 --> 00:31:39.490
development of forces of
production.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.029
And this is the revolutionary
movement, as Marx defines it.

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:47.588
This is the time when the
revolution will come because

00:31:47.588 --> 00:31:50.746
this is when we will rise
against the old social

00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:55.180
relationships and replace them
with new social relationships--

00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.446
right?--which will create new
space for further growth after

00:32:00.446 --> 00:32:03.838
development of forces of
production.

00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:06.939
Again, you know,
just to make clear,

00:32:06.939 --> 00:32:10.836
a way one of the misunderstood
ideas of Marx:

00:32:10.836 --> 00:32:15.528
Marx never said that capitalism
is not effective.

00:32:15.528 --> 00:32:18.681
On the contrary,
Marx said capitalism was the

00:32:18.681 --> 00:32:21.690
most productive system in human
history.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.275
He said, "In the last
hundred years of capitalism we

00:32:25.275 --> 00:32:29.308
achieved more progress than in
the whole human history."

00:32:29.308 --> 00:32:33.693
Or what Marx said--he wrongly
said so, he proved to be

00:32:33.693 --> 00:32:38.078
false--that it will never-- not
will go on forever.

00:32:38.078 --> 00:32:41.894
At one point capitalism,
like any other previous modes

00:32:41.894 --> 00:32:45.317
of production,
will get in conflict with its

00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:49.250
relations of production,
and that's when the revolution

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.426
will have to come.
 

00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:50.950
Right?
 

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.769
And so far we know that Marx
proved to be wrong.

00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:58.773
He underestimated the
extraordinary capacity of

00:32:58.773 --> 00:33:02.169
capitalism to adapt to major
challenges.

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:03.038
Right?
 

00:33:03.038 --> 00:33:05.842
We just have seen it in the
last eighteen months.

00:33:05.842 --> 00:33:06.308
Right?
 

00:33:06.308 --> 00:33:08.479
Well, you know,
capitalists was grumbling,

00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:09.750
"All right."
 

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.765
You know, just think about the
Lehman Brothers.

00:33:12.765 --> 00:33:13.289
Right?
 

00:33:13.289 --> 00:33:15.190
Think back in March.
 

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.650
Well, you know,
this was very shaky.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.740
Did it work?
 

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.505
It looks like it probably does.
 

00:33:21.505 --> 00:33:22.130
Right?
 

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.078
It learned how to recover.
 

00:33:24.078 --> 00:33:28.244
Anyway, Marx's point was
capitalism was really a big

00:33:28.244 --> 00:33:32.574
revolution, and unleashed the
development of forces of

00:33:32.574 --> 00:33:33.798
production.
 

00:33:33.798 --> 00:33:36.111
Now move onto the
Grundrisse,

00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:38.489
and what are the major
contributions,

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:39.808
ten years later.
 

00:33:39.808 --> 00:33:44.190
Well first of all now the
evolution of modes of production

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:48.108
is described to be changes in
property relations.

00:33:48.108 --> 00:33:52.519
This is basically where The
German Ideology ends.

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:55.540
He started at the wrong point,
division of labor,

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.500
and now property relations is a
central idea.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.720
And private ownership is now
defined in a new way.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.358
He said, "What is private
ownership?

00:34:04.358 --> 00:34:08.983
When the subjective-- laboring
subject--is completely separated

00:34:08.983 --> 00:34:13.010
from the objective conditions of
labor." Right?

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.311
You can see this is a big step
forward from The Paris

00:34:17.311 --> 00:34:21.849
Manuscript--right?--where
the essence of alienation was

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:24.039
commodity relationships.
 

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:26.389
Now it is not commodity
relationships.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:30.143
He captures the
essence--right?--of alienation

00:34:30.143 --> 00:34:33.230
in the nature of private
ownership.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:37.268
And we will talk about what
that exactly means.

00:34:37.268 --> 00:34:40.724
The transition,
therefore, to capitalism,

00:34:40.724 --> 00:34:45.650
is a separation of workers and
the conditions of labor.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.239
And Marx puts it very
powerfully.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:52.282
This is an idea which then
comes back and haunts us all the

00:34:52.282 --> 00:34:52.768
time.
 

00:34:52.768 --> 00:34:56.500
This is an idea we will be able
to read in Max Weber as well.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.574
The big progress,
what is happening,

00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:05.018
that the worker becomes free,
in a double sense of the term.

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:09.019
That is what capitalism is
producing, in contrast to

00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:11.530
traditional or feudal society.
 

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.159
He became free.
 

00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:18.525
I was slave and now there is a
civil war and it is declared 'no

00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:19.909
more slavery'.
 

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:21.570
I am legally free.
 

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:26.003
But, Marx said,
yes, capitalism produced legal

00:35:26.003 --> 00:35:32.858
freedom and legal equality,
but it also kicks you off the

00:35:32.858 --> 00:35:36.023
land,
forces you go to the city,

00:35:36.023 --> 00:35:39.018
and forces you to sell your
labor.

00:35:39.018 --> 00:35:42.889
So you are also freed from your
possessions.

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:43.610
Right?
 

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:49.670
So you don't have the means of
what a farmer had.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.030
To some extent even a slave had
some.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:57.289
But certainly the peasants did
have that means of subsistence.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:01.514
Now capitalism requires that
people do not have the means of

00:36:01.514 --> 00:36:05.954
subsistence--that you have to go
to the supermarket to buy your

00:36:05.954 --> 00:36:06.242
egg.
 

00:36:06.242 --> 00:36:07.030
Right?
 

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.101
The system would not work very
well if in your backyard you

00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:13.557
could grow everything what you
need.

00:36:13.557 --> 00:36:14.260
Right?
 

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.090
The incentive for you to work
will be substantially reduced.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:24.030
Fortunately we cannot grow our
vegetables what we need.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.409
And we have to drive to get to
work when--we have to drive to

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:29.889
get anywhere,
and we have to buy gasoline.

00:36:29.889 --> 00:36:34.110
And we are also therefore
forced to sell our labor force.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.923
This means--right?--free in the
dual sense of the term.

00:36:37.923 --> 00:36:38.489
Right?
 

00:36:38.489 --> 00:36:41.663
Legally free,
and freed from the means of

00:36:41.663 --> 00:36:42.614
subsistence.
 

00:36:42.614 --> 00:36:43.329
Right?
 

00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:47.789
The notion of freedom,
of course, said with some

00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:48.550
irony.
 

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:55.648
Okay, and then the fourth
proposition, multi-linearity.

00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:56.699
Right?
 

00:36:56.699 --> 00:37:00.706
There are various ways
societies can take from a tribal

00:37:00.706 --> 00:37:01.449
society.
 

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:04.010
And he writes about antiquity.
 

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.900
He invents the notion of the
Asiatic mode,

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.980
what he never used before,
or labor.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.239
He's talking about the
Slavic form,

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:14.949
and the Germanic form.
 

00:37:14.949 --> 00:37:18.797
And rather than talking about
modes of production,

00:37:18.797 --> 00:37:23.036
Marx, in the Grundrisse,
is writing about social

00:37:23.036 --> 00:37:26.099
formations, or economic
formations.

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:29.000
A very interesting change.
 

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.329
It's not just a change of
terms, it's a very important

00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:35.210
change in the theory.
 

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.945
Okay, just very briefly about
the evolution of the modes of

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:43.619
production and changing property
relations.

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:46.731
Well he said,
"In old pre-capitalist

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:50.010
formations,
well there is an appropriation

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.771
of natural conditions of labor,
of the earth as an original

00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:58.954
instrument of labor,
and the individual simply

00:37:58.954 --> 00:38:03.030
regards the objective conditions
as his own.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:07.507
There is no separation really
of the objective conditions and

00:38:07.507 --> 00:38:09.000
the laborer."
 

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.782
Slavery is the clearest
example.

00:38:11.782 --> 00:38:12.500
Right?
 

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.025
The Greeks said,
"The slave is a working

00:38:16.025 --> 00:38:17.068
animal."
 

00:38:17.068 --> 00:38:17.789
Right?
 

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:23.175
The slave was treated as an
object--was not really seen as a

00:38:23.175 --> 00:38:24.090
subject.
 

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:29.929
The slave did not have the
rights of an individual subject.

00:38:29.929 --> 00:38:33.909
There were no individual
liberties for the subject.

00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:38.018
I mean, it varied from slavery
to slavery--right?--in

00:38:38.018 --> 00:38:38.807
antiquity.
 

00:38:38.807 --> 00:38:39.519
Right?
 

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:41.380
That was the idea.
 

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.865
Well the serfs,
a little step further away.

00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:44.340
Right?
 

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.773
They actually do not have
ownership, but have possession

00:38:49.773 --> 00:38:52.639
of the means of production.
 

00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:57.920
They are not treated as legally
free individuals and subjects.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.335
Think about the right to the
first night.

00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:02.018
Right?
 

00:39:02.018 --> 00:39:08.577
The feudal lord had the right
to spend the first night with

00:39:08.577 --> 00:39:12.760
the bride in the case of a
wedding.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.981
You have seen the opera,
Mozart, The Marriage of

00:39:16.981 --> 00:39:17.909
Figaro.
 

00:39:17.909 --> 00:39:18.670
Right?
 

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.420
You remember what the story is.
 

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:27.498
Figaro is deeply in love with
Susanna, and wants to marry her,

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:33.079
and he is scared that the
landlord wants to live with the

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:35.969
right of the first night.
 

00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:41.893
He does not want the lord to
spend the first night with his

00:39:41.893 --> 00:39:42.710
bride.
 

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.289
Okay?
 

00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:46.869
That's the story. Right?
 

00:39:46.869 --> 00:39:49.079
An important eighteenth-century
story.

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:52.260
Anyway, so he's not quite a
subject.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.170
The worker, free worker,
is a subject.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:03.320
All right, let me just move on
to private ownership.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.313
He said under capitalism the
work, the object,

00:40:07.313 --> 00:40:11.130
are completely separated from
the worker.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:16.704
And here is--right?--the idea
that we have this double

00:40:16.704 --> 00:40:17.862
separation.
 

00:40:17.862 --> 00:40:18.809
Right?
 

00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:22.492
We are separated from the means
of our existence,

00:40:22.492 --> 00:40:24.869
but we are also legally free.
 

00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:30.420
And more citations of this kind.
 

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.807
It's also very
important--right?--that the

00:40:33.807 --> 00:40:38.518
transition to market economy
happens by pushing people off

00:40:38.518 --> 00:40:43.393
the land and forcing them into
the cities to become laborers

00:40:43.393 --> 00:40:48.269
who will depend only on the wage
what they earn on the labor

00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:49.510
market.
 

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:55.813
And now comes--a few more
minutes--an intriguing idea,

00:40:55.813 --> 00:41:00.570
these multiple trajectories he
described.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.760
Right?
 

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.300
So the initial idea was a
uni-linear trajectory.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.800
And let me just do it this way.
 

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.250
That this was the idea.
 

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.900
*&lt;*Professor writes on
blackboard&gt;&gt;

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.559
Tribal society leads to slave
society.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:29.650
That leads to feudal society,
and that leads to capitalism.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.179
Right?
 

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:33.260
And dialectics. Right?
 

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:47.230
Relations, forces of production.
 

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.340
This drives the process. Right?
 

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.199
It happens through breaks.
 

00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:51.699
Right?
 

00:41:51.699 --> 00:41:56.922
These are revolutions,
which lead from one to the

00:41:56.922 --> 00:42:03.233
next, when these dialectal
interactions leads for people to

00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:06.280
throw up the old system.
 

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:11.409
Now we have a very different
view presented here.

00:42:11.409 --> 00:42:18.949
He describes--right?--the
various forms,

00:42:18.949 --> 00:42:23.329
with different individual forms
of ownership,

00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:27.369
and points out that in fact the
uniqueness of what he called the

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:29.976
Germanic form,
Germanic tribal form,

00:42:29.976 --> 00:42:32.719
that it became individual
possession.

00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:36.427
This is indeed,
as far as even now we know from

00:42:36.427 --> 00:42:40.916
historiography,
a unique feature of Germanic

00:42:40.916 --> 00:42:46.230
tribes that they allocated the
land by lottery,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.659
before each season,
to individual families,

00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:52.940
and then families cultivated
the land.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.005
They did not have individual
property rights in the land,

00:42:57.005 --> 00:43:00.420
but they had individual
possession allocated.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:04.980
That was--the common land was
divided up by individuals or

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.739
individual families.
 

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:10.840
And that is the unique feature
of this.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.409
And here it is,
and I hope you see it quite

00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:21.503
well: the multi-trajectory
development, what he describes

00:43:21.503 --> 00:43:24.659
in the Grundrisse.
 

00:43:24.659 --> 00:43:27.367
Well, he said,
"It's not true that

00:43:27.367 --> 00:43:31.500
tribalism all led to antiquity
of slave societies."

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.114
He spent, you know,
from eight in the morning until

00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:38.369
ten in the evening,
was sitting in the British

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:40.900
library and reading like crazy.
 

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.789
And he said,
"Well something wrong.

00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:48.856
When I am looking at Asia,
there is no universalized

00:43:48.856 --> 00:43:49.849
slavery.
 

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:54.197
Well there are slaves in China
but, you know,

00:43:54.197 --> 00:43:57.460
they are kind of family slaves.
 

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.963
There are no great plantations
which are cultivated by slaves,

00:44:01.963 --> 00:44:04.768
like in Egypt or Ancient
Rome."

00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:08.934
He excessively generalized
about Rome, Greece,

00:44:08.934 --> 00:44:14.210
and Egypt the whole notion of
slave mode of production.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.340
This is unique antiquity.
 

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.849
"But when I'm looking at
Asia--

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:26.820
and in fact I'm looking at
Pre-Columbian America--

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.039
right?--there is no
universalized slavery."

00:44:31.039 --> 00:44:35.300
So he uses the term Asiatic
form.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.969
He did not know much about
Pre-Columbian Americas.

00:44:39.969 --> 00:44:45.561
He knew a little more about
India and China--did not know

00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:46.260
much.
 

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:52.585
He knew as much as usually
people could in the 1850s--was

00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:54.619
reading heavily.
 

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:58.253
But he understood that this was
a different form.

00:44:58.253 --> 00:44:58.860
Right?
 

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.025
And the uniqueness of the
Asiatic form,

00:45:02.025 --> 00:45:05.193
as he puts it,
was these were hydraulic

00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:06.360
societies.
 

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.750
They were big empires,
all organized around irrigation

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.699
and flood protection works.
 

00:45:14.699 --> 00:45:18.606
And in order to have these
irrigation and flood protection

00:45:18.606 --> 00:45:20.800
works, you needed big empires.
 

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.679
And what the big emperors in
China did,

00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:28.219
that they left the village
communes alone,

00:45:28.219 --> 00:45:33.172
as long as they did deliver
those taxes from which the

00:45:33.172 --> 00:45:39.059
imperial power was able to build
flood protection and irrigation

00:45:39.059 --> 00:45:39.900
networks.
 

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.929
Right?
 

00:45:40.929 --> 00:45:46.065
So the village commune was left
alone as a commune itself,

00:45:46.065 --> 00:45:50.300
and was not transformed into
serfs or slaves.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:56.610
China never really had a
classical case of feudalism;

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:00.257
feudalism the way how we know
it from England or

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:04.449
France--right?--or Spain,
it never existed in China.

00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:07.322
Therefore it was the Asiatic
form.

00:46:07.322 --> 00:46:08.018
Right?
 

00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:12.150
A centralized imperial
bureaucracy, and the hydraulic

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.010
economy, driven by water
problems.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.346
And then he said,
"Well there was the

00:46:17.346 --> 00:46:18.599
Germanic form."
 

00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:22.190
And I briefly talked about the
Germanic form--right?--where you

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.579
had family possession.
 

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:26.606
And he said,
"Well, where does

00:46:26.606 --> 00:46:29.099
feudalism come from?"
 

00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:32.583
The original theories said,
you know, transition from one

00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:36.132
mode of production to the next
happens because of internal

00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:37.065
class struggle.
 

00:46:37.065 --> 00:46:37.750
Right?
 

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:43.512
The theories should predict
that feudalism fell because the

00:46:43.512 --> 00:46:45.400
serfs had enough.
 

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.414
They went uprising,
hanged the slave owners,

00:46:49.414 --> 00:46:52.030
and created a new society.
 

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:56.039
Well Marx said,
"I was a jerk.

00:46:56.039 --> 00:46:57.900
This is not how it worked.
 

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.409
Look at how Rome fell.
 

00:47:00.409 --> 00:47:03.210
It was invaded by the Germanic
tribes."

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:07.065
And what is interesting,
these Germanic tribe actually

00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:11.141
had much less advanced military
technology and technology

00:47:11.141 --> 00:47:12.159
generally.
 

00:47:12.159 --> 00:47:17.750
But they had a superior social
relationship system.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:23.913
They had a more developed idea
of private ownership than Rome

00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:24.530
had.
 

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:28.094
So, in fact,
the Roman Empire fell because

00:47:28.094 --> 00:47:33.487
it was invaded by the Germanic
tribes, and they transformed the

00:47:33.487 --> 00:47:36.880
Roman Empire into a feudal
society;

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.500
they transformed slaves into
serfs.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.820
And there is also the Slavic
form.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.739
Well there is the Russian
obshchina.

00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:49.731
Well it's a kind of feudalism,
but the feudal lord actually

00:47:49.731 --> 00:47:53.036
treats the obshchina,
the village commune,

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.000
as a unit.
 

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.561
Again, it is not the central
authority in Russia who collects

00:47:58.561 --> 00:48:02.936
the rents, but the feudal lord;
but leaves to a large extent

00:48:02.936 --> 00:48:06.268
the village commune to operate
in a communal way.

00:48:06.268 --> 00:48:09.670
And therefore he said,
"Therefore I was wrong.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.023
It was not the internal class
struggle which led to the

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:13.768
evolution.
 

00:48:13.768 --> 00:48:17.893
Very often this is an external
force which leads to a change

00:48:17.893 --> 00:48:20.760
into another mode of
production"--

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.380
right?--"into another
social formation."

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.699
And therefore he said,
"Well,

00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:29.900
shall I say that the Asiatic
form necessarily will have to go

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:33.260
through feudalism before it can
be capitalism?

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.570
No way.
 

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:39.141
China is in a way already have
some signs to move towards

00:48:39.141 --> 00:48:42.980
capitalism, without creating
feudalism."

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.199
But he did not know that a
gentleman called Mao Zedong come

00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:49.068
a little later,
and he said,

00:48:49.068 --> 00:48:51.679
"And do we have to become
capitalists first?"

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:54.750
And Mao Zedong said,
"But we hate capitalism.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.539
Why don't we create communism
straight out of the Asiatic

00:48:58.539 --> 00:48:59.420
form?"
 

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.300
And that's what he was trying
to do.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.181
And therefore,
you know, he had the--this is

00:49:04.181 --> 00:49:06.460
sort of my addition,
this arrow;

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.722
of course, it did not exist in
Marx--right?--from the Asiatic

00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:10.809
form to communism.
 

00:49:10.809 --> 00:49:13.369
But that's what Mao Zedong did.
 

00:49:13.369 --> 00:49:15.320
Did it work?
 

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.949
No.
 

00:49:16.949 --> 00:49:20.820
Well one say probably it did.
 

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.085
The only point is that
Communism is not at the end,

00:49:24.085 --> 00:49:26.112
Communism is before capitalism.
 

00:49:26.112 --> 00:49:26.699
Right?
 

00:49:26.699 --> 00:49:31.036
I think Mao Zedong successfully
converted Asiatic form into

00:49:31.036 --> 00:49:35.599
Communism, in order then to move
Communism into capitalism.

00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:40.521
That's what Marx did not quite
consider, but will be completely

00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:45.045
consistent with the type of
analysis he offers--right?--in

00:49:45.045 --> 00:49:47.110
the Grundrisse.
 

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.570
And finally about the Slavic
form, and I am out of time.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.880
The same argument.
 

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.909
He gets a letter from a Russian
anarchist, Vera Zasulich.

00:49:58.909 --> 00:50:03.458
And Vera Zasulich was a great
admirer of Marx,

00:50:03.458 --> 00:50:09.018
but she was a kind of populist
anarchist left-winger.

00:50:09.018 --> 00:50:12.010
And she said,
"But Mr. Marx,

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:16.485
do you really want us to
destroy this wonderful Russian

00:50:16.485 --> 00:50:19.469
obshchina village
commune,

00:50:19.469 --> 00:50:23.114
where we live so intimately
together as brothers and

00:50:23.114 --> 00:50:27.150
sisters,
to create this hated capitalism?

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.590
Why can't we move straight into
Communism?

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.460
This is a Communistic
form."

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.179
And Marx kind of nodded.
 

00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:37.809
"Well",
he said- he responded,

00:50:37.809 --> 00:50:39.440
"it's an interesting
idea."

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.407
And this is exactly what
Vladimir Illyich Lenin and

00:50:44.407 --> 00:50:45.699
Stalin did.
 

00:50:45.699 --> 00:50:49.597
They converted the Russian
obshchina into what they

00:50:49.597 --> 00:50:53.820
called kolkhoz;
collective enterprise.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.820
All what happened,
similar to the Mao story,

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.403
it turned out not to be the
road to the most advanced form

00:51:02.403 --> 00:51:06.788
of society,
but a kind of side-road towards

00:51:06.788 --> 00:51:08.050
capitalism.
 

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.059
And the question,
what remains to be discussed,

00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:13.099
whether this side road was
necessary,

00:51:13.099 --> 00:51:16.469
and whether this was the most
effective way to move to

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:19.438
capitalism,
and what came out as capitalism

00:51:19.438 --> 00:51:23.130
from it is really the best
possible capitalism at all?

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.139
But that's for another course.
 

00:51:25.139 --> 00:51:27.554
If you take Varieties of
Capitalism, we'll talk more

00:51:27.554 --> 00:51:28.170
about that.
 

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.349
Thank you.
 

00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:35.000

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.622
Prof: There are three
issues that I want to bring up

00:00:06.622 --> 00:00:11.957
as I begin today's lecture that
will determine my general themes

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:16.184
today: improvisation,
the international dimension

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.260
that the fiction of the novel
acquires,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
and the influence of art or of
literature on reality;

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.160
those are the general topics.
 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.311
As we move to the conclusion of
the Quixote,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.880
the issue of how to bring the
novel to a close must have

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.870
loomed large in Cervantes' mind.
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.890
The plot of the novel is
repetitive,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.999
more than sequential,
with a vague quest of the

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.020
protagonist to revive the age of
chivalry,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.239
concretely, to participate in
the jousts in Saragossa as

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.371
goals,
but there is no obvious or

00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:06.459
impending goal to the
characters' wonderings.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:10.000
Although, one could argue,
with Williamson,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.069
the critic I mentioned in the
last lecture,

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.307
that the disenchantment of
Dulcinea is the main purpose of

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:25.820
Don Quixote and Sancho set by
Merlin's prophecy and involving

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.069
the three thousand lashes that
Sancho must apply to his bottom,

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.333
and the interplay between the
two about accomplishing that

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.959
goal of disenchanting Dulcinea.
 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.971
Yet, even, this is no clear
mission whose accomplishment

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.069
would bring the novel to an end.
 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.690
What if Dulcinea is
disenchanted?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.282
How could she be disenchanted?
 

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.450
What would that mean?
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.830
Would she and Don Quixote,
then, marry?

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.203
This is not mentioned by the
protagonist, nor is marriage

00:02:05.203 --> 00:02:09.139
normally a desired end to
courtly love.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.209
Love itself is the purpose of
courtly love:

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.050
the love of love.
 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:25.139
It is obvious that the only end
possible would be the death of

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:31.133
Don Quixote,
making his life the shape of

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.508
the fiction,
though, which life,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.470
would be the question?
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.666
Is it the life of Alonso
Quijano, the hidalgo who went

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:45.178
mad and became Don Quixote,
but about whose early life and

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:47.949
family we know next to nothing?
 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.573
We only know about his niece;
then, later,

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:53.276
we learn that the niece was the
daughter of a sister,

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.979
but we really don't know
anything about his life.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:02.228
Or is it the life invented by
Don Quixote, the would-be

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:04.080
knight-errant?
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.385
Would that be the life that
comes to an end,

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.490
to close the novel?
 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.754
Improvisation,
I have been saying all along,

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:17.400
seems to rule the plot of
the Quixote,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.372
the serendipitous actions
provoked by chance encounters on

00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:24.816
the road,
and by characters who pop up in

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:28.770
the second part,
wanting to script the knight's

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.677
life,
or, at least,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.870
episodes of the knight's life.
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.598
What role will improvisation
play in the ending of the novel?

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:45.628
There is a confluence of--we
will be talking about that,

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:48.169
or we will be seeing about that
in the next few lectures,

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.080
and as we come to the very end
of the novel,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.960
and discuss that.
 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.157
There is a confluence of actual
geography with current

00:03:56.157 --> 00:04:01.099
historical events,
such as the expulsion of the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.194
moriscos,
brigandage in Catalonia,

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:10.240
and the Turkish and Huguenots
menaces in the final episodes of

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.060
the Quixote.
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.928
These events return us to the
beginning of Part II,

00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:22.189
and the discussion at Don
Quixote's house about some of

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.278
them, particularly the Turkish
threat.

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:31.187
This is a form of closure,
too, this return to those

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:35.230
discussions in the beginning of
Part II.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.523
The novel acquires an
international dimension

00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:43.237
announced by Don Quixote,
the priest, and Sansón

00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:45.622
Carrasco,
talking about the Turkish

00:04:45.622 --> 00:04:49.375
threat in the early chapters,
as if Don Quixote were going

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.269
after all to try to resolve that
issue.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:58.129
But notice the concurrence of
real geographical settings.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.892
We spoke of the Ebro river,
and now we have Barcelona,

00:05:02.892 --> 00:05:05.230
with historical actions.
 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.596
We have today,
Elena Pellús and I,

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:16.769
produced a slightly primitive
map of Spain,

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:20.654
but I think that it is clear
enough to give you a notion of

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.329
what I'm talking about.
 

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:26.072
But, of course,
you have a real map of Spain in

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:29.569
the website that you can see on
your own.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.620
I will be alluding to it.
 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:42.836
So we have seen the Ebro river;
Barcelona, we have now,

00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:50.079
and now we'll see historical
actions involving that region.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:59.797
Now, none of the historical
actions that appear in the

00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:04.230
Quixote--
by historical I mean current

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.451
historical events--
none is more current and

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:14.879
pressing than the expulsion of
the moriscos,

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:21.199
which is taking place as
Cervantes is writing Part II.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.120
The topic of the expulsion
centers on the character of

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.350
Ricote and his family.
 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:35.110
He is one of the principal new
characters in Part II.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.526
The international dimension of
the novel allows Cervantes to

00:06:39.526 --> 00:06:43.418
introduce fresh kinds of
characters who are different

00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:48.360
from those mainly Castilian ones
that he has presented so far.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.336
Though, as we know--and I'll
talk about it again--not

00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:52.709
exclusively Castilian.
 

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:59.170
That's the second of the broad
topics, and the third is the one

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.399
about art-influenced reality.
 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.610
In several of these episodes
that I will be discussing,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.790
particularly the one involving
Tosilos,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.158
but also in others,
there seems to be a decided

00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:16.480
influence of art on reality,
and a coalescence of the two,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.170
by which one could say that
reality,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.305
or the real,
is improved by art,

00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:24.889
as we have already seen in
other episodes before,

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:31.160
but we have some today where
that seems to be the main topic.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.459
Now, let us begin with Ricote.
 

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:46.553
One could say that this story
is a rewriting of the captive's

00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:53.199
tale from Part I with Ricota,
whose name is Ana Félix--

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:58.649
I'll be talking about this name
in a minute--

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.540
Ricota is the name given to his
daughter;

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:17.899
her name is Ana Félix.
 

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:21.509
She will be the Zoraida of this
rewriting,

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:25.149
and Pedro Gregorio,
her suitor, would be the

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:33.109
captive,
but I mean this is--these two

00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:44.259
episodes are very different at
the same time.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:47.139
The one of the captive and the
one involving Ricote,

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.168
or, at least,
the Ricote episode,

00:08:49.168 --> 00:08:51.389
is much richer in some
respects,

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:54.658
although the captive's episode
is quite elaborate.

00:08:54.658 --> 00:09:00.495
In these last few chapters of
the Quixote Cervantes

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:06.538
appears to be offering many
possible variations of narrative

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:11.264
fiction,
or some of the narrative modes

00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:15.000
available to him at that moment.
 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.880
Ricote and his family provide
the opportunity for a mini

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.899
novela morisca,
or moorish novel.

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:35.515
A novela morisca is a
tale about the love between a

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:42.017
Christian young man and a
Moorish young woman with all of

00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:45.500
the predictable obstacles.
 

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.029
The best known of these
novelas moriscas is

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:57.524
called after its protagonists,
Ozmín y Daraja,

00:09:57.524 --> 00:10:05.494
and this novel is embedded in
the Guzmán de

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:08.100
Alfarache.
 

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.275
I won't put the name on the
board, because you've had it

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:11.820
many, many times during the
semester.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:18.328
The other fictional mode in
this kind of smorgasbord of

00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:23.028
narratives is the byzantine
romance,

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:29.096
the byzantine romance,
which entailed drawn out

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:34.769
adventures over vast
geographical areas,

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:39.682
adventures of lovers seeking to
find each other and suffering

00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:42.559
abductions,
shipwrecks and being lost in

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.730
strange lands,
only to find,

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.865
when they finally meet,
that unbeknownst to them,

00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:52.298
they are brother and sister and
cannot marry.

00:10:52.298 --> 00:11:02.650
This is kind of romance written
at the time, very convoluted,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.928
hence, byzantine.
 

00:11:05.928 --> 00:11:10.860
Now, Cervantes was writing such
a romance as he raced to finish

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.528
the Quixote.
 

00:11:12.528 --> 00:11:17.629
It's called Los trabajos de
Persiles y Sigismunda,

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:21.908
The Trials of Persiles and
Sigismunda.

00:11:21.908 --> 00:11:37.797
We will be revisiting this when
we talk about the prologue to

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:43.092
that work,
which Cervantes thought would

00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:45.330
be the culmination of his
life's--

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.298
of his career, but he was wrong.
 

00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:53.205
A very interesting idea,
that, I don't know if criticism

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:56.759
has taken it up,
would be to study the influence

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:00.418
of the writing of The Trials
of Persiles and Sigismunda

00:12:00.418 --> 00:12:02.639
on Part II of the
Quixote,

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.009
as these were books that
Cervantes worked on at the same

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:06.440
time.
 

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.510
Towards the end of his life,
he's rushing to finish the

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.640
Quixote,
and rushing to also finish

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.080
The Trials of Persiles and
Sisgismunda,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.412
and it would be interesting to
see how much one influences the

00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:17.850
other.
 

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.130
But here, as I will mention in
a little bit,

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.820
the influence is obvious.
 

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.090
Ana and Pedro's abduction by
the Turks,

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.510
and their sea-journey and
rescue, are like a small-scale

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.254
byzantine romance that is played
out in front of the port of

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:37.379
Barcelona.
 

00:12:37.379 --> 00:12:40.700
This is like a byzantine
romance in a nutshell;

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.399
they are abducted by the Turks,
they are taken away,

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:48.940
they finally meet,
and there is no ending to it,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.817
because she's a morisca
and she cannot come back to

00:12:52.817 --> 00:12:54.125
Spain,
and all of that,

00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:56.210
but that is kind of a little
byzantine romance.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.080
A hilarious tidbit,
if you have already read this,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.625
in this story,
is that Ana,

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:08.230
eager to protect Pedro from
their abductors,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.808
and Pedro is a very beautiful
young man,

00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:17.947
dresses him as a woman to make
him less attractive to the

00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:19.918
Turkish captors.
 

00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:27.264
It is a comic dig at the Turks,
whose alleged sexual

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:34.307
proclivities were notorious,
and are even mentioned in good

00:13:34.307 --> 00:13:38.860
old Sebastián de
Covarrubias' Tesoro,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.532
in the entry on the Turks,
there is a not so veiled

00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:49.044
allusion to this practice that
Cervantes is alluding to in a

00:13:49.044 --> 00:13:53.250
very,
I think, comical way.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:14:00.178
It is kind of transvestitism to
the second power or something

00:14:00.178 --> 00:14:03.759
like that, it's unbelievable.
 

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:07.897
Now, why Cervantes wanted to
provide this smorgasbord of

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:12.110
narrative possibilities at the
end is a mystery to me.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.894
One answer is that other than
just a boast of artistic mastery

00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:23.298
is that he is consciously
seeking variety in his work,

00:14:23.298 --> 00:14:27.993
and he is aware and has been
since Part I that for all of the

00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:31.200
possibilities of his newly found
hero,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.494
Don Quixote's adventures could
become monotonous and decided to

00:14:35.494 --> 00:14:38.749
include this technical
extravaganza as a kind of

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:40.548
overture or something.
 

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:44.892
This accumulation of narratives
is also a sort of closure by

00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:47.100
accumulation,
one could say.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:53.408
But let us get back to Ricote.
 

00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:57.220
First, let us consider the
name: Ricote;

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:03.332
"rico"
means "rich"

00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:06.534
in Spanish;
being rich, one is

00:15:06.534 --> 00:15:08.528
"rico."
 

00:15:08.528 --> 00:15:14.307
"Ric-ote"
is an augmentative ending,

00:15:14.307 --> 00:15:19.058
an ending that increases
something.

00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:24.932
Remember that I mentioned this
at the beginning of the course:

00:15:24.932 --> 00:15:28.879
"gordote"
is a big fatso,

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:35.298
no?;
so "Ricote" is--

00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:40.408
means that he's very rich,
which he is,

00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:43.025
though some claim,
some critics claim that his

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:46.340
name derives from his being from
the Valley of Ricote,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.750
a valley with that name,
but I don't buy that,

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:54.740
that is, I think,
a little bit too tangential.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.344
It's obvious that he's
"ricote,"

00:15:57.344 --> 00:15:59.908
because he is very rich,
and we know about that because

00:15:59.908 --> 00:16:01.668
he talks about the treasure that
he has buried.

00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:06.768
Now, with Ricote,
Cervantes passes judgment on a

00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:11.539
current event,
one that is taking place as he

00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:13.710
writes the book.
 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:20.168
The moriscos were
expelled in 1609,

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:25.028
the Edict of Expulsion,
but the whole process lasted

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:27.517
several years,
so remember,

00:16:27.517 --> 00:16:31.129
these are the years when he is
writing this book.

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:36.851
If you read your Elliott you
will know that a long debate

00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:41.754
preceded the expulsion,
as there were many people

00:16:41.754 --> 00:16:46.250
against it, mostly for economic
reasons.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.695
The moriscos were an
integral part of the economy of

00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:55.600
several regions of Spain and had
some clout in the government.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.879
Their expulsion,
as you have learned in Elliott,

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:02.240
caused ruin in some areas of
Spain,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.338
as the expulsion of the Jews,
in 1492,

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:10.255
had also brought about all
kinds of dire consequences to

00:17:10.255 --> 00:17:10.970
Spain.
 

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.548
There is a confluence,
a coalescence of the text,

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:19.664
of the fiction with current
history that we had not seen

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.358
before in Part I or even Part
II,

00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:26.556
nor in any other fiction
anywhere, with the possible

00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:29.435
exception of the
Guzmán de

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:33.699
Alfarache,
but there it is not explicit,

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:39.096
and the events mentioned are
not as dramatic and as current

00:17:39.096 --> 00:17:43.098
as the expulsion of the
moriscos.

00:17:43.098 --> 00:17:47.342
Now, the fact that the story
will eventually remain

00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:50.784
unfinished--
remember, they have to petition

00:17:50.784 --> 00:17:54.127
to Madrid to have Ana
Félix pardoned for

00:17:54.127 --> 00:17:56.308
returning to the peninsula.
 

00:17:56.308 --> 00:18:03.424
She faces the possibility of
being sent back or even of being

00:18:03.424 --> 00:18:04.730
executed.
 

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.476
Now, the fact that the story
remains unfinished leads me to

00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:13.976
think that Cervantes is
considering here how closure can

00:18:13.976 --> 00:18:19.048
be brought about in a story that
blends with ongoing time.

00:18:19.048 --> 00:18:23.010
How can you bring closure to a
story that deals with something

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.480
that is in the process of
happening?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.118
How can fictional time offer
closure to something that is

00:18:30.118 --> 00:18:32.190
happening in real time?
 

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.586
If you do that,
closure would be a way of

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:43.400
fictionalizing what is real,
by giving it an artistic shape.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.259
So this is a theoretical issue
that,

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:50.009
I'm sure, was in Cervantes'
mind, and if you remember,

00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:53.568
in Part I, the very last of the
stories is also left unfinished.

00:18:53.568 --> 00:19:02.520
I will take this up again as I
consider the ending of the

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.798
novel.
 

00:19:03.798 --> 00:19:09.588
But what is the meaning of all
of this business of current

00:19:09.588 --> 00:19:15.582
events in terms of Cervantes'
opinion about the expulsion of

00:19:15.582 --> 00:19:18.019
the moriscos?
 

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:21.430
This has been,
as you can imagine,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:27.318
a hotly debated issue with
presentism playing a heavy role

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:29.180
in the debate.
 

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.214
Presentism is a way of alluding
to a form of criticism,

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:37.027
be it of literature,
or an interpretation of history

00:19:37.027 --> 00:19:39.118
that favors the present.
 

00:19:39.118 --> 00:19:41.858
You interpret the past in terms
of the present;

00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:45.568
or you project the present onto
the past.

00:19:45.568 --> 00:19:49.681
Of course, the issue is whether
one can completely avoid this

00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:53.097
ever,
but there are some critics and

00:19:53.097 --> 00:19:58.548
some historians who exercise
this to the point where it is

00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:03.471
obvious that it's not right,
and a lot of presentism has

00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:07.468
played a role in this debate
about whether Cervantes really

00:20:07.468 --> 00:20:11.259
favored or not the expulsion of
the moriscos.

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:13.739
All of this colored by all of
the twentieth

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:16.512
century--particularly--debates
about minorities,

00:20:16.512 --> 00:20:18.519
and their roles,
and so forth.

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:21.741
In other words,
some critics want to make

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:26.575
Cervantes into a contemporary
and have him espouse views of a

00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:28.750
modern liberal thinker.
 

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.029
Cervantes is obviously appalled
at the expulsion of those

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:39.215
moriscos who were
obviously part of the fabric of

00:20:39.215 --> 00:20:43.269
the country,
those who had truly converted,

00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:47.843
but I think he tries to give a
balanced view of the whole

00:20:47.843 --> 00:20:51.136
thing,
obviously, worried about an

00:20:51.136 --> 00:20:56.263
internal enemy to the state,
given the international

00:20:56.263 --> 00:20:57.400
situation.
 

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.222
It is possible,
and it has been mentioned,

00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:04.147
that he was also worried about
himself, if he expressed an

00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:07.660
opinion obviously opposed to
that of the crown.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:15.056
But think of this:
Morocco is barely across the

00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:18.593
Straight of Gibraltar.
 

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:19.880
Here.
 

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.353
I'm sure that most of you know
that area of the world if you

00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:29.602
have seen Casablanca,
which is not there but near

00:21:29.602 --> 00:21:32.094
enough,
but I don't know young people

00:21:32.094 --> 00:21:34.410
like you have seen that classic.
 

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.788
But in any way, you know this.
 

00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:39.009
This is the Straight of
Gibraltar;

00:21:39.009 --> 00:21:44.420
here's Spain,
and Morocco is here.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.317
So Morocco was in the hands of
enemies of Spain,

00:21:47.317 --> 00:21:50.710
of the same race and religion
as the moriscos.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.920
In other words,
as opposed to the Jews,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.885
who had been expelled in 1492,
the moriscos had an

00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:01.166
international projection,
a potential international

00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:01.788
projection.
 

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:06.134
They could be allied with
foreign enemies and become a

00:22:06.134 --> 00:22:08.430
fifth column within Spain.
 

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:13.221
A fifth column is where you say
about a group of individuals who

00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:17.175
are against a government but
living within the state,

00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:18.848
within the nation.
 

00:22:18.848 --> 00:22:23.441
The moriscos,
as the episode of the captive

00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:26.990
in Part I,
allude, with their presence,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.232
to one of the central myths for
the constitution of modern Spain

00:22:32.232 --> 00:22:36.809
after the unification of the
country under Ferdinand and

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:41.736
Isabella: the re-conquest;
meaning the recovery of Spanish

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:46.354
territory from Moorish control,
which culminated with the fall

00:22:46.354 --> 00:22:48.019
of Granada in 1492.
 

00:22:48.019 --> 00:22:52.318
What I mean by this is that the
moriscos were a--

00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:58.827
with their very presence,
recalled the presence of the

00:22:58.827 --> 00:23:03.990
Moors in Spain until 1492,
and the Reconquista,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.653
the re-conquest,
had become sort of a central

00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:08.990
patriotic myth that held Spain
together.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:14.088
So the moriscos are
expelled in 1609 appealing to

00:23:14.088 --> 00:23:19.190
people's fears that the
re-conquest could be undone,

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.288
and hence that the whole
country would collapse.

00:23:22.288 --> 00:23:28.044
This is ridiculous,
of course, but governments due

00:23:28.044 --> 00:23:33.327
tend to motivate the populace
with such fears,

00:23:33.327 --> 00:23:39.200
particularly totalitarian
governments do that.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.750
Hitler did that;
in Cuba, Fidel Castro has been

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.916
announcing the impending
invasion of the Yankees for

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:50.251
fifty years--
it has never come--to keep the

00:23:50.251 --> 00:23:52.833
people aroused,
and this is what is happening

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:56.665
in the Spain of this moment,
the moriscos could

00:23:56.665 --> 00:24:02.346
somehow unleash a counter
re-conquest and bring the whole

00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:03.970
country down.
 

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.450
Now, in terms of our
protagonists,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.480
Don Quixote and Sancho the
relevant thing is that,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:19.568
here, we observe Sancho making
a difficult and delicate moral

00:24:19.568 --> 00:24:24.144
decision with respect to Ricote;
that decision is,

00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:27.396
whether to help him,
and he is in need,

00:24:27.396 --> 00:24:32.691
and Ricote also offers him a
very substantial material

00:24:32.691 --> 00:24:35.654
reward,
or, for Sancho,

00:24:35.654 --> 00:24:41.500
to be loyal to the king by
obeying his edicts.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:48.252
Sancho's memories,
by the way, play a part in the

00:24:48.252 --> 00:24:49.660
episode.
 

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:55.910
He recalls crying when Ricote's
family left his town,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.068
and reveals that Ana
Félix has Pedro Gregorio,

00:25:00.068 --> 00:25:03.009
a mayorazgo,
as his suitor.

00:25:03.009 --> 00:25:05.038
A mayorazgo is a word
you already know.

00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:08.556
Pedro Gregorio is not only a
Christian young man,

00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:11.778
but a very well-to-do Christian
young man.

00:25:11.778 --> 00:25:18.972
Sancho chooses a middle ground:
he will not help Ricote dig up

00:25:18.972 --> 00:25:23.290
the treasure,
but he will keep silent about

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:28.490
Ricote's illegal return to Spain
and his plan to take the money

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:34.240
out of the country,
which is also illegal.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.731
There were heavy sanctions
against taking money out of the

00:25:35.731 --> 00:25:37.819
country,
because, with the expulsion,

00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:41.420
as always happens when certain
people are expelled from a

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.798
country and they take the
riches,

00:25:43.798 --> 00:25:45.818
this affects the economy of
country tremendously.

00:25:45.818 --> 00:25:51.803
So there were laws against the
moriscos taking their

00:25:51.803 --> 00:25:54.279
wealth with them,
too.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:58.269
So Ricote is guilty of two
crimes;

00:25:58.269 --> 00:26:02.209
having returned,
and also planning to take money

00:26:02.209 --> 00:26:03.970
out of the country.
 

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:12.220
Sancho makes a very difficult
decision, because he himself is

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:18.215
taking a risk;
if it is learned that he has

00:26:18.215 --> 00:26:24.996
not reported Ricote's return,
he could be also held

00:26:24.996 --> 00:26:27.028
responsible.
 

00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:31.462
Now, Ricote himself is a
complex character and is one of

00:26:31.462 --> 00:26:36.220
the few figures not mocked at
all in any way in the book.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.798
By complex, I mean that he's
caught in conflicting dilemmas,

00:26:40.798 --> 00:26:44.680
and he's able to weigh
different points of view.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.590
He is comparable to Hagi
Morato, Zoraida's father in Part

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.519
I,
but here this is more--this is

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:58.343
expanded,
because his wife has converted

00:26:58.343 --> 00:27:02.269
to Christianity,
his daughter was born into

00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:06.663
Christianity,
he has not quite converted,

00:27:06.663 --> 00:27:11.259
he is in a very difficult
situation.

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:15.305
Ricote says that he's not
against the Edict of Banishment,

00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:18.657
of expulsion;
he understands the reason of

00:27:18.657 --> 00:27:21.761
state behind it,
but laments that even those

00:27:21.761 --> 00:27:25.390
moriscos who have joined
the mainstream of society,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.500
even converting to
Christianity,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.652
are paying for the actions of
those who are seditious and with

00:27:31.652 --> 00:27:33.490
whom he does not agree.
 

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:38.190
Sancho confesses to his
neighbor in passing,

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:44.538
in this marvelous postprandial
exchange they have,

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:47.779
after he and the German beggars
and all of that get drunk with

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:52.076
their wine and eat and so forth,
Sancho confesses his travails

00:27:52.076 --> 00:27:56.358
as a governor and unsuitability
for the position,

00:27:56.358 --> 00:28:01.269
and Ricote, who is clearly
better educated than Sancho,

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:05.220
and can tell that the whole
thing had to be a hoax,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.568
does not press the matter.
 

00:28:07.568 --> 00:28:12.140
In this, Ricote displays a deep
human understanding and

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:17.049
forbearance for the shortcomings
of another human being;

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.318
Sancho's ignorance.
 

00:28:18.318 --> 00:28:22.180
It is a very subtle touch on
the part of Cervantes.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:27.277
There is a certain neighborly
complicity by which the figures

00:28:27.277 --> 00:28:31.608
of Sancho and Ricote are rounded
out, filled out.

00:28:31.608 --> 00:28:36.768
The squire is growing
intellectually and spiritually

00:28:36.768 --> 00:28:42.421
as the novel progresses,
and Ricote, as I said,

00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:49.327
is a very complex and
well-rounded character who goes

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:54.640
through a very dramatic process
here.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.395
My friend, the distinguished
Puerto Rican scholar Luce

00:28:59.395 --> 00:29:11.058
López-Baralt,
Professor at the University of

00:29:11.058 --> 00:29:17.644
Puerto Rico,
has written eloquently--she's

00:29:17.644 --> 00:29:20.042
an arabist--
has written eloquently about

00:29:20.042 --> 00:29:22.900
the moriscos and the
literature they produced,

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.282
learning about it may help us
understand better Ricote's

00:29:27.282 --> 00:29:30.049
plight,
as depicted by Cervantes in

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:31.509
the Quixote.
 

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:36.378
I'm referring to a study by
Lopéz-Baralt entitled

00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:39.920
"What Image Did the
Moriscos Have of

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.779
Themselves?"
 

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:46.165
She writes: "If I were to
symbolize the fundamental image

00:29:46.165 --> 00:29:50.048
of themselves that the Spanish
moriscos had,

00:29:50.048 --> 00:29:55.526
I believe that the epithet used
by Mancebo [a morisco she's

00:29:55.526 --> 00:29:59.680
writing about]
would be the most appropriate,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.230
'criers,' 'or weepers.'
 

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.923
When the moriscos,
being deposed [by the

00:30:05.923 --> 00:30:07.608
authorities]
cried.

00:30:07.608 --> 00:30:11.390
Instead of rewriting elegant
passages from their literature,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.340
they were determined to
preserve for posterity a

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.045
faithful image of themselves and
how they reacted before the

00:30:18.045 --> 00:30:21.058
historical crisis that was
coming upon them.

00:30:21.058 --> 00:30:23.483
[Then she adds]
And this is precisely what

00:30:23.483 --> 00:30:26.676
morisco literature is
about [because there was a

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:28.509
morisco literature].
 

00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:32.208
It constitutes a literary
monument to the collective

00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:35.980
effort to preserve at all costs
Islamic identity,

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.130
mortally wounded in the Spain
of the Golden Age.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.711
It was an enormous effort,
because the basic elements of

00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:44.920
Islamic culture,
the language,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.460
proper names,
distinctive dress,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.932
religious ceremonies,
even the zambra dance

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:55.325
had been strictly forbidden by
numerous official decrees issued

00:30:55.325 --> 00:30:57.946
all along the sixteenth
century."

00:30:57.946 --> 00:30:58.940
Unquote.
 

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.337
She adds, finally:
"But these very same

00:31:02.337 --> 00:31:06.241
moriscos,
divided in the deepest recesses

00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:09.535
of their souls,
found themselves before a new

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:13.348
dilemma when Philip III decreed
against them the Order of

00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:14.778
Expulsion in 1609.
 

00:31:14.778 --> 00:31:17.878
They had not been allowed to
become bona fide

00:31:17.878 --> 00:31:20.308
Spaniards in their country of
origin,

00:31:20.308 --> 00:31:23.785
but they did not have time
either to become authentic

00:31:23.785 --> 00:31:27.930
Muslims during the first decades
of their exile in berberie.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.929
The morisco community
went through two different

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:34.346
processes of assimilation,
their Islamic identity had been

00:31:34.346 --> 00:31:37.613
torn from them forcibly in the
Spain of the sixteenth and

00:31:37.613 --> 00:31:41.011
seventeenth centuries,
and when they finally immersed

00:31:41.011 --> 00:31:44.275
in the process of assimilating
themselves to official

00:31:44.275 --> 00:31:46.154
Spanishness,
they were forced by

00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:48.038
circumstances to begin another
process,

00:31:48.038 --> 00:31:52.065
now the opposite one,
of cultural assimilation."

00:31:52.065 --> 00:31:52.838
Unquote.
 

00:31:52.838 --> 00:31:55.173
In other words,
as you have read here,

00:31:55.173 --> 00:31:58.516
when they went back to their
countries of origin--What

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:00.028
countries of origin?
 

00:32:00.028 --> 00:32:03.991
They were from Spain--they
found that they were not

00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:08.114
accepted in the Muslim
communities where they thought

00:32:08.114 --> 00:32:13.068
that they would be welcomed,
and where they would be able to

00:32:13.068 --> 00:32:15.787
blend themselves into the
mainstream.

00:32:15.787 --> 00:32:16.240
No!
 

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.868
They were exiles,
again, within their own people;

00:32:20.868 --> 00:32:24.680
they were in a no-man's land
culturally speaking.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.364
This is the drama that Ricote
and his family is living

00:32:28.364 --> 00:32:31.769
through, and that Cervantes is
mentioning here.

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:35.694
In short, what Cervantes
accomplishes in the episodes

00:32:35.694 --> 00:32:38.788
involving Ricote is to provide a
view,

00:32:38.788 --> 00:32:43.058
a vision of the effects of
political decisions made,

00:32:43.058 --> 00:32:45.279
with concern for the nation as
a whole,

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:48.920
on the people that are affected
by those decisions.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.730
The novel is not a treatise on
political philosophy,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.279
nor is it a commentary on
government policies,

00:32:56.279 --> 00:33:02.053
it is a medium through which
the particular can be perceived

00:33:02.053 --> 00:33:05.380
in the lives of specific people.
 

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.480
Of course, what Cervantes is
dealing with here,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.210
is an issue that has affected
humanity since time immemorial,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.818
and that would continue to
affect it until the present,

00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:20.424
until today,
until the issues that we are

00:33:20.424 --> 00:33:23.308
facing in this country,
today.

00:33:23.308 --> 00:33:25.674
It is the presence of
minorities within a body

00:33:25.674 --> 00:33:28.303
politics and how a state can
deal with them without

00:33:28.303 --> 00:33:30.088
endangering its own existence.
 

00:33:30.088 --> 00:33:33.977
More broadly speaking,
the issue is how nations and

00:33:33.977 --> 00:33:37.009
states define themselves
negatively,

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:41.488
as that which they are not,
and try to wage wars against

00:33:41.488 --> 00:33:45.397
real or perceived enemies,
and cleanse their own

00:33:45.397 --> 00:33:50.045
population of potential internal
enemies that may be accomplices

00:33:50.045 --> 00:33:51.519
of external ones.
 

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:54.317
This seems to be a constant in
human history,

00:33:54.317 --> 00:33:57.499
and one can see its
manifestations in the Bible and

00:33:57.499 --> 00:33:59.088
classical literature.
 

00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:03.507
The modern history of abuses
provoked by these tendencies is

00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:07.400
long and shameful from the
expulsion of the Jews,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.099
from Spain in 1492,
to the extermination of

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:13.250
millions of them by the Nazi
regime in Germany.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.614
In the Spain that we are
studying, it was not only the

00:34:16.614 --> 00:34:20.485
moriscos that did not fit
within the homogenous body of

00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:22.835
the nation: gypsies,
conversos,

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:26.731
and the people in regions,
such as Catalonia and Galicia

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:30.150
who were out of sorts with the
Castilian driven state.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.139
Catalonia, Galicia up here.
 

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.956
We have seen through the
Quixote characters from

00:34:36.956 --> 00:34:39.217
other provinces,
like the Basque,

00:34:39.217 --> 00:34:41.550
the Galicians,
the Asturians.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.289
Spain is a country divided
against itself,

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:48.666
and continues to be so,
if not, google "ETA,"

00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:53.722
the Basque terrorist group,
the Basque terrorist group

00:34:53.722 --> 00:34:57.860
whose activities are centered
all over,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.880
but I mean, they are in both
Spain and France,

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:10.199
because that's where Basque
people live,

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:13.500
and have lived there since the
beginning of time.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.090
They have no idea where the
Basque came from;

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.449
their language is not
Indo-European,

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.530
they have no idea where it came
from,

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:27.539
so they are separatists,
and the extreme group,

00:35:27.539 --> 00:35:32.224
the terrorist group ETA is
fearsome to both the Spanish and

00:35:32.224 --> 00:35:33.760
the French state.
 

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.644
Cervantes' Quixote is
the first substantial work of

00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:43.617
fiction that dramatizes this
conflict, and the Ricote story

00:35:43.617 --> 00:35:45.760
is the most dramatic.
 

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.289
From the point of view of
literature,

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:52.152
the thing to keep in mind is
that the conflict involving the

00:35:52.152 --> 00:35:55.210
expulsion of the moriscos
is seen in its particulars,

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.411
not in general terms,
and that its poignancy is due

00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:01.099
to the believability of the
characters,

00:36:01.099 --> 00:36:05.900
especially Ricote,
but also in the tenderness,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.969
the neighborly solidarity that
he and Sancho display.

00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:15.039
These are human qualities and
emotions that are beyond

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:19.496
political policies,
and the novel will from now on

00:36:19.496 --> 00:36:23.590
always be about them,
these particulars,

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.219
not the general themes.
 

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:32.929
So, so much for Ricote and Ana
Felix for the time being.

00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:35.929
We may have to return to them.
 

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:39.079
But now let us fall into the
pit with Sancho.

00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:46.710
I assume that you have read
this wonderful chapter,

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:52.018
in which Sancho falls into a
pit, which is a symmetrical

00:36:52.018 --> 00:36:58.786
episode to the Montesinos cave,
adventure of his master Don

00:36:58.786 --> 00:36:59.949
Quixote.
 

00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:04.797
There is an internal parallel,
by means of which Cervantes

00:37:04.797 --> 00:37:07.690
parodies himself within Part II.
 

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.155
I had told you that there are
episodes in Part II that are

00:37:11.155 --> 00:37:13.650
repetitions of episodes within
Part II.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.559
This episode is a parody of the
Montesinos cave,

00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:20.690
which was itself a parody of
several chivalric episodes,

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.650
as well as others,
episodes in Homer,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.739
Virgil and Plato.
 

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:30.550
These lifts Sancho to a kind of
equality with his master,

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.932
it is a funny one,
but nevertheless,

00:37:32.932 --> 00:37:35.518
it is an equality with his
master.

00:37:35.518 --> 00:37:40.438
It is to be noted,
however, that Sancho falls into

00:37:40.438 --> 00:37:45.860
the pit cave after losing his
island: fall of Troy,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.177
Aeneas' descent,
there is a kind of pattern,

00:37:50.177 --> 00:37:50.880
here.
 

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.768
I have a series of quotes,
here, that I want to gloss from

00:37:55.768 --> 00:38:00.742
an excellent article written
jointly by Raymond McCurdy and

00:38:00.742 --> 00:38:06.010
Alfred Rodríguez,
and I will quote them and gloss

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.050
them as I did with the
Lopéz Baralt:

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.914
"As an internal parallel
[they say]

00:38:12.914 --> 00:38:17.394
the series of actions that we
study [meaning the fall into the

00:38:17.394 --> 00:38:18.864
pit]
have exceptional

00:38:18.864 --> 00:38:20.480
characteristics.
 

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.688
It is, in the first place,
the most prominent example of

00:38:23.688 --> 00:38:26.956
the deliberate parallelism that
largely structures the

00:38:26.956 --> 00:38:29.833
Quixote,
the parallel in which the

00:38:29.833 --> 00:38:33.599
obvious resemblance that strikes
one is descent,

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:37.568
fall, common subterranean stay
[he's talking about the cave of

00:38:37.568 --> 00:38:40.315
Montesinos in this parallelism,
he calls it a

00:38:40.315 --> 00:38:41.139
parallelism]."
 

00:38:41.139 --> 00:38:44.460
They quote Juan Marasso,
who says,

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.264
M-A-R-A-S-S-O:
"'We notice the

00:38:47.264 --> 00:38:50.681
correspondence,
the striking parallelism of

00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:54.045
cycles in Part II:
enchantment of Dulcinea [like

00:38:54.045 --> 00:38:58.561
the loss of Troy],
descent to Montesinos cave [the

00:38:58.561 --> 00:39:03.168
infernal descent of Aeneas],
Sancho Panza loses his island

00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:06.088
[loss of Troy],
falls into a deep and very dark

00:39:06.088 --> 00:39:09.795
pit [infernal descent].'"
So you can see that they have

00:39:09.795 --> 00:39:12.460
noticed these parallelisms in
great detail.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:18.311
They add: "The parallel
that we're studying by offering

00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:24.063
a curious parody of a parody
becomes a mirror that reflects

00:39:24.063 --> 00:39:29.221
Cervantes' entire creative
process [because this is a

00:39:29.221 --> 00:39:38.469
parody of a parody,
a parody of Cervantes himself].

00:39:38.469 --> 00:39:42.949
Cervantes [they say]
produces with a Sancho Panzean

00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:48.148
adventure [now you can make
Sancho Panza into an adjective]

00:39:48.148 --> 00:39:53.434
at least for the reader who
picks up all of the hints strewn

00:39:53.434 --> 00:39:58.626
by the novelists and innovative,
and at the same time snide

00:39:58.626 --> 00:40:01.090
re-parody,
double parody.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.271
By doing this,
the great novelist touches on

00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:06.420
purpose the aesthetic limits of
his own artistic procedure,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.449
for it would appear to be the
limit of parodic creation,

00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:13.050
a limit insurmountable and
innovative,

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.072
a self parody that is,
moreover, a parody of a

00:40:16.072 --> 00:40:17.079
parody."
 

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:21.509
This is reaching deep into that
series of images that are

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:26.255
repeated deep into that mirror
where we see each other in the

00:40:26.255 --> 00:40:28.393
barber shop,
as a little boy,

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:30.280
when you're reflected over and
over,

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.969
and over, and over, and over.
 

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:37.284
Now, we also noticed now,
having abandoned McCurdy and

00:40:37.284 --> 00:40:42.737
Rodríguez,
that this episode involves a

00:40:42.737 --> 00:40:47.811
desengaño,
which makes Sancho even more

00:40:47.811 --> 00:40:51.096
reflective,
and he no longer yearns for the

00:40:51.096 --> 00:40:51.719
island.
 

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:57.550
He values more his service and
his attachment to Don Quixote;

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.389
he yearns for the intimacy of
their relationship.

00:41:00.389 --> 00:41:07.262
Now, they are--then,
because Don Quixote finds

00:41:07.262 --> 00:41:10.074
Sancho,
because he has gone out to

00:41:10.074 --> 00:41:13.199
practice for this joust,
his encounter he's supposed to

00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:14.780
have,
and, by chance,

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.141
hears Sancho's laments,
and that encounter is going to

00:41:19.141 --> 00:41:23.295
be the one to restore
Doña Rodríguez's

00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:26.960
daughter's honor by having the
young man,

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:35.099
who promised to marry her,
and compromised her honor,

00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:37.400
go ahead and marry her.
 

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.405
So, here, we have--we go to the
third of the topics I had

00:41:41.405 --> 00:41:44.909
mentioned, an instance of art
influencing life.

00:41:44.909 --> 00:41:48.503
The prank organized by the duke
and his minions brings about the

00:41:48.503 --> 00:41:52.041
possible marriage of the young
woman to the young man who plays

00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:54.610
the role of her estranged
fiancé,

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.952
because it is not longer the
real fiancé

00:41:56.952 --> 00:41:59.476
who's involved,
but it's someone who's playing

00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:01.030
the estranged fiancé.
 

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:05.166
This adventure will turn out
like the love conflicts of Part

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:08.916
I that Don Quixote solves,
except that here the fiction is

00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:11.965
turning to reality,
whereas, in the Dorotea,

00:42:11.965 --> 00:42:15.931
Fernando, Pandafilando affair,
the giant is only symbolically

00:42:15.931 --> 00:42:16.268
slain.
 

00:42:16.268 --> 00:42:19.550
Fiction and reality are no
longer separate in Part II.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.420
They are part and parcel of
each other.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:26.539
Fiction dose not simply reflect
reality, it affects it;

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:27.166
it affects it.
 

00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:29.449
Fiction and reality appear to
be one and the same.

00:42:29.449 --> 00:42:33.449
Or in other words,
reality is nature improved by

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:33.960
art.
 

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.670
In the episode,
we have, again,

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.349
a marriage where social
mobility is involved.

00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:41.217
Dueña Rodríguez's
daughter was going to marry up

00:42:41.217 --> 00:42:43.443
economically,
because this young man was

00:42:43.443 --> 00:42:47.250
aloft, but the groom proxy,
Tosilos, is a mere servant,

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.050
a lackey.
 

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:51.831
She, however,
concludes that it is better to

00:42:51.831 --> 00:42:57.297
marry than not at all,
and accepts him in a gesture of

00:42:57.297 --> 00:43:02.570
pragmatism that is completely at
odds and funny,

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.519
but is completely at odds with
all of the notions of idealized

00:43:05.519 --> 00:43:06.730
love that we have here.
 

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:10.456
She sees that it's better to
get married than not to be

00:43:10.456 --> 00:43:12.898
married at all,
in the situation in which she

00:43:12.898 --> 00:43:14.739
is in,
and the context in which she

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:15.550
finds herself.
 

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.699
There is an echo here,
I find, a very funny one,

00:43:18.699 --> 00:43:22.550
suddenly about--the fight is
about to begin,

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.130
and this proxy groom looks at
the woman,

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.039
huh!, and falls in love with
her, and says,

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:32.750
I don't want to fight,
I surrender,

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.516
I'll marry her;
and in the end she says,

00:43:35.516 --> 00:43:38.313
okay, I'll marry him,
better him than nobody,

00:43:38.313 --> 00:43:42.612
and this is what is funny,
so the fiction becomes the

00:43:42.612 --> 00:43:45.164
reality,
that is, the fiction--well,

00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:46.380
it's very obvious.
 

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.670
There is an echo here of
Camacho's wedding,

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.887
so in a sense this episode is
also repetition of an episode in

00:43:53.887 --> 00:43:58.643
Part I,
like Sancho's fall in the cave

00:43:58.643 --> 00:44:02.030
of Montesinos adventure.
 

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.869
But the point is that fiction
has improved reality,

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.233
and this is a theme that is
repeated in the next two

00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:10.320
episodes that I'll discussed
very briefly,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.679
but they are very significant.
 

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:15.916
The first and most commented
about is when they find these

00:44:15.916 --> 00:44:20.449
images of chivalric saints
covered with sheets on the road.

00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:25.262
This episode is remindful of
the one towards the end of Part

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:27.434
I,
when the penitents carry an

00:44:27.434 --> 00:44:31.161
image of the virgin-- remember,
in the procession--and Don

00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:34.170
Quixote takes her to be a lady
in distress.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:39.148
Here, as with the actors in the
wagon of death episode,

00:44:39.148 --> 00:44:42.099
Don Quixote makes no mistakes.
 

00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:48.472
Actually, he does quite an
erudite study of the image of

00:44:48.472 --> 00:44:50.210
Saint George.
 

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:54.349
Don Quixote knows that these
are representations.

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:58.844
Critics have seen in this
episode echoes of the debates

00:44:58.844 --> 00:45:02.577
involving erasmians,
and those whose Protestant

00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:06.840
leanings about images and other
devout representations in this

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.610
episode.
 

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:08.923
If you've read,
in the Elliott,

00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:10.809
and you know,
there was a whole debate about

00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:13.219
whether there should be
religious images in the churches

00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:13.789
or not.
 

00:45:13.789 --> 00:45:18.777
Of course, the faction in favor
of religious images obviously

00:45:18.777 --> 00:45:22.019
won in Spain,
but there was a debate.

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.719
It involved Erasmus, too.
 

00:45:23.719 --> 00:45:29.284
But the point is that reality,
here, appears to have turned

00:45:29.284 --> 00:45:32.054
into art;
what he finds on the road are

00:45:32.054 --> 00:45:35.722
already representations of these
saints, are artistic images of

00:45:35.722 --> 00:45:36.550
the saints.
 

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.199
They're there, out there.
 

00:45:38.199 --> 00:45:42.780
The second episode,
which I find most charming,

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.650
is when Don Quixote is caught
in a net,

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.320
in a green net that was set
there among the trees to capture

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.795
birds,
by these young ladies playing

00:45:53.795 --> 00:45:58.985
at being shepherdesses,
and getting ready to perform an

00:45:58.985 --> 00:46:02.286
eclogue by Garcilaso,
that poet I have mentioned so

00:46:02.286 --> 00:46:04.788
man times in the semester,
that I hope you remember his

00:46:04.788 --> 00:46:07.500
name--eclogue,
these pastoral poems.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.360
They are about to stage one of
them.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.768
They have learned the lines,
and all of that,

00:46:12.768 --> 00:46:16.309
she says, and Don Quixote vows
to stand in the middle of the

00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:19.250
road and defend him for however
long it takes,

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.916
and--so reality again appears
as art: young women dressed as

00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:29.059
shepherdesses about to stage an
eclogue by the great Garcilaso.

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:33.347
Notice that Garcilaso's poetry
has become a part of common

00:46:33.347 --> 00:46:37.154
discourse;
it has improved common every

00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:38.710
day discourse.
 

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:41.518
These young ladies want to
represent his poetry.

00:46:41.518 --> 00:46:46.284
Garcilaso--remember,
1501-1536, only thirty-five

00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:49.789
years he lived,
but when his poetry was

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:52.550
published in 1543,
posthumously,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:58.559
it changed poetry written in
the Spanish language forever,

00:46:58.559 --> 00:46:59.739
until today.
 

00:46:59.739 --> 00:47:01.559
That's how important he was.
 

00:47:01.559 --> 00:47:05.106
But notice that his poetry has
been incorporated into every day

00:47:05.106 --> 00:47:06.079
life, by these.
 

00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:12.500
So we conclude by talking about
Roque Guinart.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:17.070
Roque Guinart is a
Catalán bandit,

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.530
who really existed,
and like the moriscos he

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:24.199
brings out an international
dimension to the novel.

00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:27.159
Brigandage of this kind was
common on Catalonia,

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:30.230
there were bands of brigands
like this,

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:35.650
which the crown felt that it
had to put down,

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.260
not only because they were
outlaws,

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.318
but because they could become
accomplices of the French

00:47:41.318 --> 00:47:42.219
Huguenots.
 

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:46.221
Now, notice,
again, the map that we have

00:47:46.221 --> 00:47:46.940
here.
 

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.503
Now, in the case of the
moriscos,

00:47:50.503 --> 00:47:55.070
we had the threat of Muslims
across the Straight of

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:56.349
Gibraltar.
 

00:47:56.349 --> 00:48:01.590
Here, Catalonia is right next
to France, and in some ways is

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.989
more French than Spanish.
 

00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:07.297
Certainly, more French than
Castilian, and the language and

00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:09.751
all of that, and has been very
secessionist,

00:48:09.751 --> 00:48:10.949
like the Basques.
 

00:48:10.949 --> 00:48:15.307
To today, the Catalans think
that they have their own

00:48:15.307 --> 00:48:17.364
culture,
they should have their own

00:48:17.364 --> 00:48:19.583
nation, many of them do,
and so forth,

00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:23.880
and so on, and these bandits,
like Roque Guinart,

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.199
could be in cahoots with the
French Huguenots--

00:48:28.199 --> 00:48:30.389
Huguenots were the French
Protestants,

00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:33.759
Huguenots were the French
Protestants with a Calvinist

00:48:33.759 --> 00:48:36.860
background,
who believed in the--that they

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.579
could attain salvation without
the intervention of the Church,

00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:45.809
who believed in reading and
interpreting scripture directly,

00:48:45.809 --> 00:48:49.503
typically the things that the
Catholic Church rejected

00:48:49.503 --> 00:48:51.610
violently,
especially from Spain;

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:56.190
so Huguenots were dangerous.
 

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.936
Also Spain and France had been
at odds throughout the sixteenth

00:49:00.936 --> 00:49:04.039
century,
so the French were no friends

00:49:04.039 --> 00:49:08.304
of the Spaniards,
and so the Spanish crowd feared

00:49:08.304 --> 00:49:12.320
these Catalan bandits,
because they could be agents of

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.639
the French Huguenots.
 

00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:17.679
Remember what I said about
states defining themselves

00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:20.400
negatively, as what they are
not.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.360
What the Spanish crown was not
was Protestant for sure,

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.780
and not French,
and not Muslim.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:32.219
But Roque Guinart is a
compelling attractive figure.

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:37.335
Cervantes was fascinated by the
autonomous world of the bandit

00:49:37.335 --> 00:49:39.179
and by his chivalry.
 

00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:44.228
A bandit like Roque invents
himself on the margins of the

00:49:44.228 --> 00:49:44.768
law.
 

00:49:44.768 --> 00:49:49.659
There is something romantic
avant la lettre,

00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:52.722
in Roque;
he anticipates the bandit

00:49:52.722 --> 00:49:56.420
figures who are heroes in
nineteenth-century novels,

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.250
Jean Valjean,
and all of the others.

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:03.403
Guinart is a kind of Catalan
Robin Hood, who robs the rich

00:50:03.403 --> 00:50:05.300
and helps those in need.
 

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.577
He's lawless,
except within the very strict

00:50:08.577 --> 00:50:10.059
laws of his band.
 

00:50:10.059 --> 00:50:11.840
You saw how strict they are.
 

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.675
One of his associates questions
the division of the booty,

00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:17.090
and he beheads him.
 

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:23.036
In this respect Roque is like
Monipodio and his brotherhood in

00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:28.492
Riconete y Cortadillo;
his band is an anti-utopia,

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:32.547
a counter society,
a self enclosed world built

00:50:32.547 --> 00:50:34.530
from within itself.
 

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:41.059
Is goodness possible within an
outlaw society?

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:45.110
Goodness always appears
possible in Cervantes.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.489
Remember Maritornes who is good
to others.

00:50:48.489 --> 00:50:52.733
She's kind to Sancho,
and also reliable within the

00:50:52.733 --> 00:50:56.775
practices of her profession,
perhaps not a bad trade,

00:50:56.775 --> 00:50:59.429
even if her profession is being
a prostitute,

00:50:59.429 --> 00:51:01.230
but she delivers.
 

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:06.313
Is Guinart a new exemplar of
the heroic that Cervantes can

00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:08.809
never stop dreaming about?
 

00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:14.000
Is he an exemplary man of arms
as opposed to a man of letters?

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.570
Is Guinart Don Quixote's
counterpart?

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:21.030
Is he not a modern
knight-errant of sorts?

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:26.829
Isn't this what makes him
attractive to Don Quixote?

00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:30.059
Notice that they treat each
with respect,

00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:34.179
that Don Quixote knows about
the existence of Roque Guinart,

00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:37.443
and Roque Guinart seems to have
read or heard about Part I of

00:51:37.443 --> 00:51:42.927
the Quixote,
because he also knows about Don

00:51:42.927 --> 00:51:46.813
Quixote,
so there is a kind of self

00:51:46.813 --> 00:51:52.398
recognition parallel to the one
we find in the episode with

00:51:52.398 --> 00:51:55.675
Cardenio,
when Don Quixote finds Cardenio

00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:59.242
and they have that meeting,
where they looked at each other

00:51:59.242 --> 00:52:02.210
having the uncanny feeling that
they know each other,

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.719
and here, when Don Quixote
meets Roque Guinart,

00:52:05.719 --> 00:52:08.789
we have the same kind of
recognition,

00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:14.226
of mutual recognition,
and, I know you because I know

00:52:14.226 --> 00:52:16.110
myself, kind of.
 

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:20.434
So that is Roque Guinart,
who makes possible Don

00:52:20.434 --> 00:52:25.956
Quixote's entry to Barcelona,
because this bandit is in

00:52:25.956 --> 00:52:30.768
touch, and has influence,
with the important people in

00:52:30.768 --> 00:52:35.063
the city of Barcelona,
so Don Quixote gets a kind of

00:52:35.063 --> 00:52:39.817
safe conduct from the bandit to
enter the great city of

00:52:39.817 --> 00:52:42.711
Barcelona,
but not before--we cannot

00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:46.702
conclude without mentioning an
episode within the episodes of

00:52:46.702 --> 00:52:49.083
Roque Guinart,
and it's that about Claudia

00:52:49.083 --> 00:52:49.829
Jerónima.
 

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:58.280
In Claudia Jeronima we have yet
another story,

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.400
another love story,
with a lady in distress,

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.489
because her lover seems to not
be willing to marry her,

00:53:05.489 --> 00:53:09.289
because there is a class
disparity or something,

00:53:09.289 --> 00:53:11.880
but Claudia Jerónima
takes drastic action by killing

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.876
her fiancé,
Don Vicente,

00:53:13.876 --> 00:53:19.878
who's a potential Don Fernando,
who in his death throws swears

00:53:19.878 --> 00:53:24.010
that he has been the victim of
rumors,

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.833
that he has not been unfaithful
to Claudia Jerónima.

00:53:27.833 --> 00:53:30.802
Too late, Claudia
Jerónima took care of

00:53:30.802 --> 00:53:31.329
him.
 

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:40.471
This is one of the cervantean
women characters who wants to

00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:46.460
take her destiny into her own
hands;

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:50.927
she goes a little too far, here;
perhaps it is a reprise of the

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:54.436
bodas de Camacho,
because of the scene,

00:53:54.436 --> 00:53:58.099
but with a different and very
tragic ending.

00:53:58.099 --> 00:54:05.059
Here, uncharacteristically,
tragedy occurs before marriage,

00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:07.340
which is unusual.
 

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.858
Tragedies in the Golden Age
Spanish literature tend to

00:54:10.858 --> 00:54:14.856
happen after marriage,
and we don't know if it is just

00:54:14.856 --> 00:54:19.380
another instance of Cervantes
taking episodes from Part I,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.454
or even within Part II,
and taking them one step

00:54:22.454 --> 00:54:23.110
further.
 

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:29.550
In the next class we will be
talking about our protagonist's

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:34.286
arrival in Barcelona,
also about Avellaneda's

00:54:34.286 --> 00:54:37.750
spurious Quixote,
which, by now has appeared,

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:41.853
and Cervantes knows about it,
and which resurfaces in the

00:54:41.853 --> 00:54:46.539
scene of their visit to the
printing shop,

00:54:46.539 --> 00:54:50.150
and also we will talk about Don
Quixote's final defeat.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:55:00.030
But I want you to pay special
attention to Altisidora's dream;

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:06.490
Altisidora is this very active
young lady with an active

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:11.190
imagination and proclivity to
acting,

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.938
and all of that,
who has a marvelous dream in

00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:20.476
one of the episodes,
when Don Quixote and Sancho go

00:55:20.476 --> 00:55:23.219
back to the duke and duchess's
palace,

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:29.300
and it's an episode her dream
in which the whole issue of

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.449
books will resurface again.
 

00:55:32.449 --> 00:55:38.000

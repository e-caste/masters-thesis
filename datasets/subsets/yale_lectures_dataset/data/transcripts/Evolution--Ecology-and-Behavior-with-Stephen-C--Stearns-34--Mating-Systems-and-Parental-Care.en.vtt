00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.555
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about mating systems and

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:08.650
the way that they interact with
parental care,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.434
and a bit about parental
neglect, as well as parental

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:18.160
care,
and parental conflict over care.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.620
So there was just a little hint
of that in the elephant example.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.030
What kind of a mating system do
elephants have?

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.090
Anybody know?
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.770
Student:  Harem.
 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.920
Prof: It's a harem,
it's a harem.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.520
Actually it's a family
structured situation.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.743
Normally there is a matriarch
who is a grandmother,

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:42.000
and then her daughters are
there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.270
The bulls come in during
breeding season,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.850
and normally the males are
separated from the females.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.137
Anybody know about how far away
one elephant can hear another

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:53.740
elephant?
 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.450
It's thought to be on the order
of ten to fifteen kilometers.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.650
They communicate like blue
whales, with extremely low,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.819
intense low-frequency rumbling
sounds.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.311
So, in fact,
they can find each other from a

00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:11.239
long distance.
 

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:14.719
So even though a bull elephant
might be ten or fifteen

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.528
kilometers away from a matriarch
and her group of potential

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:21.090
mates, he can get there in a
hurry;

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.580
he knows where they are.
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.857
Okay, so today we're going to
talk about benefits and costs of

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:27.980
parental care.
 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.744
We're going to note that the
degree of parental care varies

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:35.120
tremendously among different
species of organisms.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.540
We'll see that there are
interesting reasons why females,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.310
in some cases,
and males in others,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.879
and in only a few cases both
parents,

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.319
care for the offspring.
 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.122
We'll consider the issue of
when it pays a parent to neglect

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:55.280
or kill an offspring,
or when it pays offspring to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.440
kill siblings.
 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.456
And a lot of these kinds of
questions have been illuminated

00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:03.090
by the thought of Tim
Clutton-Brock.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.480
Here is Tim on his ranch at the
border between South Africa and

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.830
Botswana, with his group of
habituated meerkats.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.621
And Tim has got an interesting
way of thinking that I recommend

00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.598
you look into.
 

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:22.145
He likes to come up with
extremely simple explanations as

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:25.229
alternatives for current
bandwagons.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.412
So Tim has published a number
of papers in which he offers

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:33.668
simple explanations for things
that people thought had been

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:37.872
selected by kin selection;
simple explanations for

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:42.660
cooperation or living in a group
and things like that.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.682
And in so doing he is actually
expressing what one might call

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:52.037
the empiricist Cambridge
tradition, as opposed to the

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.800
theoretical Oxford tradition.
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.678
The word that the Cambridge
people have for Oxford is the

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.798
art school in the midlands,
and that the Oxford people have

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:05.741
for Cambridge is the
technical school in the

00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.288
downs.
 

00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:10.770
So they differ in their--they
differ in interesting ways.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.669
At any rate,
that's Tim on his ranch in

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.419
South Africa.
 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.420
He's worried a lot about
parental care,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.580
and he's written a whole book
about it.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.018
So parental care is anything
that the parent does that

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:25.038
increases the fitness of that
particular parent's offspring.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.788
And investment is different
from care.

00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:30.942
Parental investment,
which really was defined by

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:34.673
Robert Trivers,
is the extent to which parental

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:39.150
care reduces the parent's
residual reproductive value.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.369
So it's basically measured by
looking at the reduction in

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.628
residual reproductive value.
 

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:50.722
So it's something that
increases the fitness of this

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:53.657
offspring,
or this set of offspring,

00:03:53.657 --> 00:03:57.198
at a cost to any other
component of the parent's future

00:03:57.198 --> 00:03:57.919
fitness.
 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.740
Okay?
 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.289
So how do they do it?
 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.258
Well there are lots of ways.
 

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:05.399
They can prepare nests,
produce gametes,

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.009
take care of eggs.
 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.561
There's care of young;
without getting them any food,

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:12.718
you can just protect them from
predators.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.098
You can provision young before
hatching or birth.

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:17.759
There are lots of ways of doing
this.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.250
You can store food;
we'll see examples of that.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.778
You can allow the offspring to
eat you;

00:04:24.778 --> 00:04:28.569
which is what spiders do,
and some mites.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.077
You can set up a situation in
which offspring are eating eggs

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:35.281
or siblings;
that's adelphophagy,

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.740
so that's kind of an elaborate
way of providing a supermarket

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.009
for your offspring.
 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.821
You can have them eat special
secretions of ovary or oviduct,

00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:48.589
and we'll see an interesting
example of that.

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:52.206
They can eat secretions
produced in special brood

00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:56.048
chambers, or they can get
nourished via placentas or

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:57.629
pseudo-placentas.
 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:04.110
So we ourselves are extremely
derived in the way that we

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.939
provide parental care.
 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.596
And if we look at Nature,
we see a huge range of

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:11.528
variation.
 

00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:16.190
And we can see cases in which
evolution has taken parental

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.790
care to a certain point and then
stopped--

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.237
like this seems to be good
enough, or maybe this is the

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:25.475
best--
and it's not the situation we

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:26.069
have.
 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.404
So here's some data that
addresses a pretty

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:31.550
straightforward question.
 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.509
These are the first,
second and third eggs,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.050
which are laid into a herring
gull nest,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.370
and what you can see basically
is that the heavier the egg,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.699
the higher the survival or the
lower the mortality.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.615
So if the egg is heavy--and it
doesn't really matter whether

00:05:52.615 --> 00:05:56.278
it's the first,
second or third in the

00:05:56.278 --> 00:06:03.012
series--then the probability of
fledging is going to be about

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:05.625
80%,
and if the egg is small,

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:09.699
the probability of death is
going to be just about 100%.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.778
So this is a herring gull
chick, hatching out of an egg.

00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:17.744
And what you can see from that
simple data is that making

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.019
bigger eggs is better for
herring gulls,

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.427
and it makes a big difference
to their abilities probably to

00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:25.177
themoregulate,
resist disease,

00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:28.759
resist tics and parasites;
all sorts of stuff.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.851
Now in terms of paternal
care--this is a frog,

00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:40.579
the Coqui frog from Puerto
Rico.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:43.648
And it has, by the way,
spread around the world and is

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:46.389
something of a pest,
because if you hear a couple of

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:47.980
thousand frogs going
"coqui,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.829
coqui, coqui" all night,
you don't sleep very well.

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:54.004
So people in Coqui infested
areas are sleep deprived,

00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:55.529
and they don't like it.
 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.745
But it's an interesting frog
because it has male parental

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:02.622
care,
and the frogs,

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:06.343
the male frogs,
are tending a bunch of tadpoles

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:10.872
that are living in the water
which is resting between the

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:15.079
leaf of a plant and the main
stem of the plant.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:18.403
So they're up in a tree,
and they're guarding this from

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.480
snakes, insect predators,
other kinds of things.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.601
And if you remove the male at
various stages of egg

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:30.629
development--this graphs what
percent of the eggs are going to

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.350
hatch and turn into tadpoles.
 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.266
And basically you can see--and
by the way, these are about one

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:38.370
to two days for each stage of
development;

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.180
so it's roughly three to four
weeks that's going on here--

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.776
you can see that if the eggs
have been allowed to develop

00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:49.326
quite a while,
then removing the father

00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:51.449
doesn't make that much
difference;

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.459
after the sixteenth stage
they're going to make it.

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:58.370
But early in the process his
presence is absolutely critical.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.492
So there really isn't any way
that this father can abandon

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:06.110
that nest without suffering a
huge fitness loss;

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.370
and that's measured by these
low numbers down here.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.800
It can be quite risky to guard
a nest.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800
So this is a fish with a great
name;

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.550
it's called the lump-sucker,
and it lives off of Scotland,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.728
and it lives in places off of
Scotland where there are otters

00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:30.350
that are foraging in the shallow
water near shore.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.798
And the males are guarding
nests.

00:08:34.798 --> 00:08:38.562
This is, by the way,
not an unusual mating pattern

00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:39.330
in fish.
 

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.259
You have it in gobies,
you have it in sticklebacks.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:45.264
Males--in some wrasses--you'll
have a male build a nest and

00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:49.268
females will come and deposit
eggs in it, and the male will

00:08:49.268 --> 00:08:50.580
guard the eggs.
 

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.365
And basically what this shows
is the number of lump-suckers

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:57.323
that are caught by otters,
and you can see that the males,

00:08:57.323 --> 00:09:00.120
who are defending the nest,
have a much higher probability

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.000
of getting killed by an otter
than the females.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.820
So this is something where
parental care really has a high

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.288
cost.
 

00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:14.548
Defending the offspring can
involve death.

00:09:14.548 --> 00:09:21.398
Now guarding the offspring is
not necessarily something that

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:25.808
involves provisioning the
offspring.

00:09:25.808 --> 00:09:29.500
Here is a Cacao stinkbug in
Trinidad,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.519
and you can see that it is
huddled over--

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.389
it's a female--and it's huddled
over all of these offspring that

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:40.945
have hatched out of these eggs,
and they will guard the eggs

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:44.904
and the nymphs,
and if you pull the mother off,

00:09:44.904 --> 00:09:48.691
there probably won't be any
eggs that survive to produce

00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:49.379
nymphs.
 

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:52.145
And these things will get
nailed, the babies will get

00:09:52.145 --> 00:09:56.754
nailed by parasitoid wasps;
they will get nailed by

00:09:56.754 --> 00:09:59.418
foraging lacewings.
 

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:04.628
There is a very diverse and
fascinating group of predators

00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:10.019
and parasitoids that will do
things like eat insect eggs.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:15.719
And here is a nice photo of an
Australian stinkbug with all of

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:19.269
its offspring huddled underneath
it.

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:23.822
Parental care is actually
fairly widespread in the insects

00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:25.899
and in other arthropods.
 

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:31.649
Centipedes are among the really
great parents of the world.

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:34.522
They are nasty and they will
sting you, but they have a nest

00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:37.590
and they go out foraging and
bring food back to their babies.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.195
And centipedes will raise their
babies until they are virtually

00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:42.649
the size of the adults.
 

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:47.200
So they actually get weaned at
about 80% adult size.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.490
They have usually a clutch of
perhaps ten or twelve offspring.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:58.404
So here is an example where the
provisioning is done before the

00:10:58.404 --> 00:11:00.788
eggs hatch or are born.
 

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:02.788
This is something that a scarab
beetle does.

00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:07.990
And there are a number of
beetles--the dung beetles,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.528
the burying beetles and the
scarab beetles--

00:11:11.528 --> 00:11:15.370
that will dig tunnels into the
ground,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.556
put food into the tunnels,
and then the female will lay

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:22.668
her egg on the food.
 

00:11:22.668 --> 00:11:27.077
So often one of the choice
criteria for the female is how

00:11:27.077 --> 00:11:31.328
good is my male at digging a
tunnel, and is he actively

00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:33.769
engaged in provisioning it?
 

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:36.129
So the male clears the entrance.
 

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:37.548
He's going to defend it.
 

00:11:37.548 --> 00:11:39.710
Males gather fresh leaves and
bugs.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.899
He takes them down to the
female.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.750
She makes them into elliptical
balls,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.549
and then lays her egg here,
into something that develops

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:53.437
into a grub,
and then eats up the balls and

00:11:53.437 --> 00:11:56.538
pupates down in the hole.
 

00:11:56.538 --> 00:12:03.381
Some of the more ghastly kinds
of parental care involve setting

00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:08.899
up a situation in which siblings
eat each other.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:12.580
And the eating of a sibling has
a nice Greek name,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.389
which makes it a little bit
more clinical,

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:17.320
so you don't get so emotionally
involved with it,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.918
adelphophagy;
okay, the eating of siblings.

00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:26.100
And it is not uncommon in
sharks.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.105
This is an early dissection of
a pregnancy in a porbeagle

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:33.638
shark;
and you see here an offspring

00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:36.899
that has a big yolk sack and
it's starting to grow.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:44.268
And normally a porbeagle shark
will start out with a fair

00:12:44.268 --> 00:12:49.633
number of embryos;
something on the order of ten

00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:50.668
to twenty.
 

00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:55.700
And often only one of them
survives to be born;

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.028
it's the one that managed to
eat up all the others.

00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:06.570
And an adult porbeagle shark is
a pretty impressive object.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.580
This is actually not a really
big one;

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.690
okay, this is--it's about six
feet long.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:19.705
Porbeagle sharks will get up to
about twelve or fifteen feet

00:13:19.705 --> 00:13:20.298
long.
 

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:25.524
And other sharks that do this
include bull sharks in the

00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:28.655
rivers of Central--
you can catch them in the

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:32.149
rivers of Central America--
and several other shark species.

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:38.529
You can also find this kind of
behavior in Whelks.

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:42.798
So there are mollusks that will
lay eggs in clumps,

00:13:42.798 --> 00:13:48.350
and the first one to hatch out
goes around and eats the others.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:54.033
So it's a method of ensuring
that there is a high quality,

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:59.418
appropriately balanced diet
awaiting your offspring.

00:13:59.418 --> 00:14:03.311
These things that they're
eating have got exactly the

00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:06.379
biochemical constituents that
you need.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.799
And it's an interesting
theoretical issue to think of

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:13.285
how can the payoff in the
quality of the one offspring

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:17.232
possibly compensate for the loss
in numbers of the say ten or

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.929
fifteen that died in nourishing
it?

00:14:23.778 --> 00:14:28.460
Now another way to nourish
young is to have some kind of

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.970
specialized secretion in the
ovary or the oviduct,

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.649
and that's the case in a vector
of great medical importance,

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:40.740
Glossina, the tsetse fly.
 

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.139
And it has a really very
interesting life history.

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:48.408
It just gives birth to one
offspring at a time.

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.628
Most flies will go around
laying, you know,

00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:52.371
fifteen, twenty,
fifty eggs a day,

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:53.639
something like that.
 

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:56.764
Glossina just makes them one at
a time, and they make them big

00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:58.250
and lunky and high quality.
 

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:05.744
And it stays in the mother's
reproductive system until its

00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:09.559
second instar,
and it's getting fed with a

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:13.129
milky secretion there that it's
absorbing through its mouth.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:16.940
When it's born--here it's being
born--it immediately then falls

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.889
into the soil,
digs into the soil and pupates.

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:22.820
So it doesn't feed at all
outside the mother.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.490
The mother has given it
everything it's going to get.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.486
Other things that feed
offspring with secretions in

00:15:33.486 --> 00:15:37.110
brood chambers are pipefish and
seahorses;

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.350
and there are some frogs that
will do this.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:45.727
And some of these have kind of
pseudo-placenta where there are

00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:49.960
blood vessels that surround the
brood chamber.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.172
And in the case,
of course, of the seahorse,

00:15:54.172 --> 00:15:59.364
the female has an ovipositor
that looks kind of like a

00:15:59.364 --> 00:16:00.538
phallus.
 

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:04.975
So when seahorses copulate,
the female takes her ovipositor

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:09.259
and inserts it into a slit in
the male's brood pouch,

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:16.149
and deposits the babies into
the male's brood pouch;

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:18.990
which is an interesting issue.
 

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.054
And, of course,
seahorses have lots of other

00:16:22.054 --> 00:16:23.408
wonderful things.
 

00:16:23.408 --> 00:16:26.576
The leafy sea-dragon,
by the way, which is a favorite

00:16:26.576 --> 00:16:30.047
of aquariums and book covers,
lives off the coast of South

00:16:30.047 --> 00:16:32.385
Australia;
so it actually is a fairly

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:33.529
coldwater seahorse.
 

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:39.808
Then you can take care of your
babies,

00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:42.570
not by giving them something
before they're born,

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.523
but you can make a nice egg,
and then when it hatches you

00:16:45.523 --> 00:16:47.370
can feed them after they're
born.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.558
And that is something which is
done by burying beetles.

00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:55.988
So we have burying beetles to
thank for the fact that the

00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:59.230
landscape is not littered with
corpses.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.586
I have been fairly impressed--I
have to trap mice out of my

00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:06.875
house sometimes;
I have both white-footed deer

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:10.480
mice and Southern bog lemmings
in my house in Hamden.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.200
And my method of disposal is
pretty straightforward.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.038
I take them out of the trap and
I throw them in the garden.

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:20.230
They're gone in the summertime
within one night.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.759
The burying beetles come along
and take care of them.

00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:28.420
So that was a bit of the
natural history.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:28.980
Okay?
 

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.630
Now are there overall
connections?

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.820
Are there general patterns that
we can pull out for parental

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.200
care?
 

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.346
Well there is,
as you might think,

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:40.663
as would be logical,
there is a relationship between

00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:44.240
the mating system and the
pattern of parental care.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.650
So if both parents care for the
offspring,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.049
then they are usually either
monogamous in their mating

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:54.913
system--
so things like swans--or

00:17:54.913 --> 00:17:59.590
they're polygynandrous,
which means that they're things

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.730
like dunnocks.
 

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:08.525
If only the female takes care,
that's usually a polygenous

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:09.140
species.
 

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.548
So the only thing that the male
is providing is display behavior

00:18:13.548 --> 00:18:17.190
and sperm, and then the female
is on her own with the

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.170
offspring.
 

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.597
The ones that are male-only are
either polyandrous or

00:18:21.597 --> 00:18:22.720
polygynandrous.
 

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.317
Male-only parental care
therefore usually turns up in

00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:28.808
the few polyandrous bird
species,

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:33.719
or in things like ostriches,
which are not really

00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:40.163
polyandrous but where they have
a male that will protect a large

00:18:40.163 --> 00:18:43.982
clutch of eggs,
into which many females will

00:18:43.982 --> 00:18:46.736
deposit eggs;
and the fish that have the same

00:18:46.736 --> 00:18:47.759
kind of pattern.
 

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.410
Okay?
 

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.662
So sticklebacks,
lump-suckers,

00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:54.690
gobies, things like that.
 

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.980
The issue of--you can think of
it like this.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.410
Who gets stuck with the kids?
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.430
And the type of fertilization
really has quite a bit to do

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.502
with the probability that it
will be the male or the female

00:19:06.502 --> 00:19:10.000
that is going to do the parental
care and raise the offspring.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.031
Species that have external
fertilization are more likely to

00:19:14.031 --> 00:19:17.438
have male parental care than
species with internal

00:19:17.438 --> 00:19:18.690
fertilization.
 

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:24.000
And that makes sense because
with external fertilization the

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.230
female is coming and spawning
with the male,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.843
and the object to be cared for
is then actually physically

00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:37.618
there in a space that the male
might have reasons to want to

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:38.509
defend.
 

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:42.743
In internal fertilization,
the offspring are actually

00:19:42.743 --> 00:19:46.980
contained in and physically
inside of the female,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.108
and they're going to be there
for a while,

00:19:49.108 --> 00:19:51.319
which gives the male
opportunity to wander off,

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:53.490
or run off.
 

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.188
And so the type of
fertilization,

00:19:56.188 --> 00:20:00.741
for very simple reasons,
is associated with whether the

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.788
male or the female takes care of
the babies.

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.845
So one of the reasons that
seahorses are really a striking

00:20:07.845 --> 00:20:10.417
an exception to almost
everything is that they're

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:13.259
monogamous and they have
internal fertilization,

00:20:13.259 --> 00:20:15.730
but they have male parental
care.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.480
So they are monogamous.
 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.338
They will stay together as a
pair, throughout their lives.

00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:24.211
They have internal
fertilization inside the male's

00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.902
brood pouch, but it is the male,
of course, who's taking care of

00:20:27.902 --> 00:20:28.430
them.
 

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.461
And the reason is the same:
basically they're in his brood

00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:35.150
pouch and the female can wander
off.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.154
In this case it's interesting;
she doesn't really,

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.529
she sticks around.
 

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:41.150
So here are some examples.
 

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.009
The swans, which are
monogamous, and then the

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.154
dunnocks, which are
polygyandrous,

00:20:46.154 --> 00:20:50.118
are cases where both parents
will care for the offspring.

00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:53.029
If you want to see swans
nesting right now,

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:55.670
just go out Whitney,
turn left on Waite,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.458
go down across Lake Whitney,
and you can see three swan

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:01.348
nests that have been constructed
in the last few days.

00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:04.240
There will be cygnets within a
few weeks.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.894
So maybe before you leave for
the summer, if you have a break,

00:21:07.894 --> 00:21:11.068
go out to Lake Whitney and you
will see baby swans.

00:21:11.068 --> 00:21:16.898
The ones where the mother takes
care of the offspring are

00:21:16.898 --> 00:21:19.190
usually harem-based.
 

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.803
Now the reasons for the
existence of the harems are

00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:26.848
different in things like elk and
deer and in marmotes.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:32.009
With elk and deer,
they are foraging widely,

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:38.250
and the females are in a group
for protection against

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.930
predators.
 

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.078
And the males,
of course, have a mating season

00:21:42.078 --> 00:21:44.660
and fight with each other for
access to the females.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.180
But they're moving around.
 

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.286
And the male,
during mating season,

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:49.650
will defend a harem.
 

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.829
So this will happen,
of course, also with things

00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:56.348
like elephant seals,
where you have harem defense.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:22:01.960
But it's a special case with a
broad-leaf foraging ungulate.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.690
With something like a marmote,
the harem is basically based--

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.059
it's a resource defense harem
where the male is sitting on a

00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:14.893
pile of rocks,
and he's defending his pile of

00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:16.308
rocks against other males.
 

00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:18.308
And the females live in the
pile of rocks,

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:21.039
and they would live in that
pile of rocks if the male was

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:23.441
there or not;
I mean, they use that as their

00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:23.858
refuge.
 

00:22:23.858 --> 00:22:27.846
So basically what he does is he
finds a place in the environment

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:31.136
that the females need,
and then he defends it against

00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:32.150
other males.
 

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.660
So that is a resource-based
kind of harem mechanism.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.974
Whereas here it's not the
resources, it's just the females

00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:44.000
themselves that are getting
defended by the males.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.798
The females are wandering all
around looking for food.

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:52.263
The ones where it's the father
only are things like phalaropes,

00:22:52.263 --> 00:22:57.728
which are a genus of sandpipers
that nest in the North and into

00:22:57.728 --> 00:22:59.048
the Arctic.
 

00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:02.390
This is the brightly colored
female phalarope,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.855
and in related species of
sandpipers that are not

00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:08.159
polyandrous,
the bright color and the

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.750
secondary sexual characteristics
are in the male,

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.269
not in the female.
 

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:15.022
And when the female is
developing her bright colors and

00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:17.561
displaying to the male,
her ovaries are secreting

00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:20.085
testosterone,
and she defends the territory

00:23:20.085 --> 00:23:23.430
and goes around and lays eggs in
three or four nests.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.198
And when the males are sitting
on the eggs that she has put in

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.950
the nest, their testes are
producing estrogen.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.579
So, in fact,
the switch in sex role is

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:40.915
handled by a hormonal switch,
and it's eliciting a genetic

00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:45.151
program that is evidently
present in both sexes and can

00:23:45.151 --> 00:23:49.857
either feminize or androgenize
the bird in which the hormones

00:23:49.857 --> 00:23:51.269
are produced.
 

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:55.650
And that's how the switch in
mating system is handled.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.311
Pipefish and their relatives,
the seahorses,

00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:03.230
are also cases that have male
parental care.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.107
And in the seahorse that's
probably a case where there was

00:24:07.107 --> 00:24:11.481
a prior period of polyandry;
like pipefishes or like

00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:17.060
phalaropes, where you had one
female mating with several

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.930
males, and then that developed
into monogamy.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.460
Okay?
 

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.088
So how could that happen?
 

00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:29.839
How could you possibly get into
polyandry and then possibly from

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:31.650
that go into monogamy?
 

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:37.330
Well having one female mating
with several males might occur

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:42.049
when one parent can rear as many
offspring as two,

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:44.940
when the foraging is good.
 

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.963
So, you know,
from the female's point of

00:24:46.963 --> 00:24:49.376
view,
sticking this male with three

00:24:49.376 --> 00:24:52.326
or four eggs,
and then going off and finding

00:24:52.326 --> 00:24:56.029
another male and giving him
three or four eggs will be much

00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:59.990
more likely to evolve when that
act of going to the second male

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.502
doesn't harm the fitness
prospects of the first brood so

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.269
much.
 

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:08.868
So the father really could take
care of that many.

00:25:08.868 --> 00:25:12.343
It's only likely to happen if
you're starting from a position

00:25:12.343 --> 00:25:15.470
where the males are already
pretty heavily involved;

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.461
you know, you can't make a huge
jump into this kind of mating

00:25:18.461 --> 00:25:21.143
system,
you have to be evolving from a

00:25:21.143 --> 00:25:25.364
mating system in which both
parents are already taking care

00:25:25.364 --> 00:25:26.818
of the offspring.
 

00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:29.915
It probably happens mainly
where therefore where the

00:25:29.915 --> 00:25:32.951
clutches are small,
and you can produce eggs pretty

00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:33.680
rapidly.
 

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.212
And this seems to be true in
things like the phalaropes,

00:25:38.212 --> 00:25:43.160
polyandrous shorebirds and
cassowaries and in buttonquail.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.643
More likely to happen if the
females are big,

00:25:46.643 --> 00:25:51.472
and therefore not likely to get
beaten up by an outraged male;

00:25:51.472 --> 00:25:52.818
and dominant.
 

00:25:52.818 --> 00:25:56.638
And in humans polyandry is
actually culturally driven,

00:25:56.638 --> 00:26:00.242
and it's associated with
co-inheritance of farms by

00:26:00.242 --> 00:26:02.741
brothers;
and that happens in Tibet and

00:26:02.741 --> 00:26:03.118
Nepal.
 

00:26:03.118 --> 00:26:07.460
So here are four brothers who
share one wife.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:12.690
And that is a very kind of
agriculturally restricted mating

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:17.200
system, and it has to do with
inheritance rules.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.160
And you'll find in cultural
anthropology,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.913
if you go around the world,
that those kinds of culturally

00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:28.586
inherited inheritance patterns
really have a fairly large

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:33.340
effect on human mating patterns
and parental care patterns

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.259
around the world.
 

00:26:35.259 --> 00:26:40.361
So dowry societies are quite
different from bridal gift

00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:44.336
societies,
and where all the brothers in a

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.440
family can only inherit one
farm,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.578
and space is restricted and
life is harsh.

00:26:51.578 --> 00:26:54.009
Those things make big
differences.

00:26:54.009 --> 00:27:00.626
Okay, how do reproductive
conflicts interact with parental

00:27:00.626 --> 00:27:01.440
care?
 

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.816
Well we've already seen that
there can be parent-offspring

00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:08.578
conflict over parental
investment.

00:27:08.578 --> 00:27:13.808
So that can lead to issues of
sex allocation in chimpanzees.

00:27:13.808 --> 00:27:16.619
You'll recall the
Trivers-Willard hypothesis which

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:19.028
said that if you are a dominant
female,

00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:21.003
you want to invest more in
sons, and if you are a

00:27:21.003 --> 00:27:22.978
low-ranking female,
you want to invest more in

00:27:22.978 --> 00:27:23.430
daughters.
 

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.527
Because in a society that has a
dominance hierarchy that gives

00:27:28.527 --> 00:27:32.788
high ranking males better
probability of mating,

00:27:32.788 --> 00:27:35.220
and therefore better
probability of grandchildren,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.321
you only really want to invest
in males if they're going to

00:27:38.321 --> 00:27:40.730
have a good chance of rising in
that rank,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.098
and that would be because you
yourself,

00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:46.108
as a female,
are already dominant;

00:27:46.108 --> 00:27:49.012
that gives you a good predictor
that your son might have high

00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:49.740
rank as well.
 

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.538
Whereas if you are a
low-ranking female,

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:56.272
in poor physiological
condition, then you don't really

00:27:56.272 --> 00:28:00.499
get very much out of investing
in a son that will have little

00:28:00.499 --> 00:28:02.190
prospect for mating.
 

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.814
But you can still get
grandchildren out of investing

00:28:05.814 --> 00:28:06.880
in daughters.
 

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.598
So we've been through that for
chimpanzees.

00:28:09.598 --> 00:28:12.551
We've also discussed how
male-female conflict over

00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:16.167
parental investment will lead to
pregnancy conflicts that are

00:28:16.167 --> 00:28:18.880
mediated by genomic imprinting
in humans;

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.853
those are David Haig's ideas,
as further developed by Bernie

00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:23.460
Crespi.
 

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.346
And there can be sib
competition conflict over

00:28:27.346 --> 00:28:32.009
parental investment that will
lead to analyses of brood

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:33.220
reduction.
 

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.230
So it's a fairly common
observation among raptors--

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:44.118
eagles, and among herons and
their allies,

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:47.915
egrets and herons,
and among owls--that they will

00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:51.869
lay a clutch that has
significantly more eggs in it

00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:54.559
than they can possibly fledge.
 

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:56.230
The babies will hatch.
 

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.858
The parents are not able to
feed all of them equally well.

00:29:00.858 --> 00:29:03.548
The babies will fight with each
other for access to food,

00:29:03.548 --> 00:29:05.420
and they'll actually kill each
other;

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.557
so that out of one of these
nests, where maybe four to six

00:29:08.557 --> 00:29:11.638
eggs might have been laid,
you'll get one to two fledging

00:29:11.638 --> 00:29:12.410
offspring.
 

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.694
And while the siblings fight
with each other,

00:29:15.694 --> 00:29:19.380
the parents do not intervene;
they just stand back and they

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.089
let it happen.
 

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.926
So the kin selection argument
on this is that offspring want

00:29:29.926 --> 00:29:33.630
more parental investment than
the parents want to give them,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.960
because the parent has 50%
relationship to all offspring.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.798
The offspring is 100% related
to itself and 50% related to

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:41.538
siblings.
 

00:29:41.538 --> 00:29:47.008
So on this assumption you
should see overt conflicts

00:29:47.008 --> 00:29:52.180
between parents and offspring;
and that's broadly confirmed.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.640
Okay?
 

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.074
Usually at weaning and fledging
the offspring are complaining

00:29:57.074 --> 00:30:00.028
and the parents are shoving them
away.

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:04.191
And this kind of conflict is
won by the mothers in

00:30:04.191 --> 00:30:05.380
chimpanzees.
 

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.799
You should see offspring that
are soliciting their parents and

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:14.292
actually causing their parents
to exceed their optimal level of

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:17.410
investment and reduce parental
fitness.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.298
This doesn't really seem to
happen too much.

00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:23.682
But in the social hymenoptera
one can see that the colonies

00:30:23.682 --> 00:30:27.064
are producing sex ratios that
are optimal for the offspring

00:30:27.064 --> 00:30:28.930
rather than for the parents.
 

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.182
So there's a fairly complex
theory of what the sex ratio

00:30:33.182 --> 00:30:36.200
should be of a social insect
colony,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.430
based on the interests of the
workers,

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.720
versus the interests of the
queen and the king.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.719
And there are skewed sex ratios
that come out of colonies

00:30:44.719 --> 00:30:46.788
reflecting worker interest.
 

00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:52.368
So sometimes the offspring do
seem to be able to take control

00:30:52.368 --> 00:30:56.088
of that aspect of parental
investment.

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:59.395
There's another prediction,
which is that the offspring

00:30:59.395 --> 00:31:02.945
should solicit to a level that
would actually cause them to

00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:04.598
have significant costs.
 

00:31:04.598 --> 00:31:06.880
So you should see the offspring
trying really hard,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.700
to the point where they're
paying costs in terms of their

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.862
own fitness in order to get more
investment out of parents and

00:31:14.862 --> 00:31:18.478
essentially blackmail them into
not investing in other

00:31:18.478 --> 00:31:19.568
offspring.
 

00:31:19.568 --> 00:31:21.430
There's very little data on
that.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:27.356
So Bob Trivers is the guy that
when he was a graduate student

00:31:27.356 --> 00:31:30.728
at Harvard,
and a junior fellow at Harvard,

00:31:30.728 --> 00:31:33.230
and was a young father with
children,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.549
came up with the theory of
parent-offspring conflict.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:45.230
I mentioned that raptors are
birds--this is a survivor of a

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.049
parent-offspring- of an
offspring-offspring conflict.

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:52.548
But it is set up by the parents.
 

00:31:52.548 --> 00:31:55.759
Remember that if you have
siblicide going on in nest of

00:31:55.759 --> 00:31:58.078
eagles or hawks or egrets or
herons,

00:31:58.078 --> 00:32:01.971
that it is the parents who have
decided that there will be a

00:32:01.971 --> 00:32:05.656
competition in that nest,
and they have done it by laying

00:32:05.656 --> 00:32:07.078
that many eggs into it.
 

00:32:07.078 --> 00:32:10.664
So this is something that's
going on in the lifecycle of

00:32:10.664 --> 00:32:13.730
just about every single one of
these raptors.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:18.843
They have been through a very,
very stringent period early in

00:32:18.843 --> 00:32:19.440
life.
 

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.617
And of course in female hyenas
there is something like that

00:32:22.617 --> 00:32:23.440
that goes on.
 

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.617
So this is a case where we have
all kinds of behavioral ecology

00:32:28.617 --> 00:32:32.210
and evolutionary ecology coming
together.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:38.279
So hyenas are a case of female
reproductive dominance.

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:42.272
In the first week of life,
the sisters fight viciously

00:32:42.272 --> 00:32:43.630
with each other.
 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.480
I learned last night that this
happens in the Iberian Lynx as

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:47.930
well.
 

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.715
One of the reasons that it's
difficult for conversation

00:32:50.715 --> 00:32:53.759
biologists to save the Iberian
Lynx is that there are only a

00:32:53.759 --> 00:32:55.048
hundred of them left.
 

00:32:55.048 --> 00:32:58.664
And they get a female into the
breeding facility and she gives

00:32:58.664 --> 00:33:01.153
birth, and when the cubs are
one-month-old,

00:33:01.153 --> 00:33:03.170
they start to kill each other.
 

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.088
And that lasts for about a
month;

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:07.576
they just go at it,
and usually there's only one

00:33:07.576 --> 00:33:08.160
survivor.
 

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.890
The same thing happens in
hyenas.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.440
It appears that there's
over-expression of testosterone.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.317
Well we know, we've measured it;
not me, but Lawrence Frank and

00:33:17.317 --> 00:33:19.858
others have measured
testosterone levels during

00:33:19.858 --> 00:33:22.180
pregnancy, and there's
over-expression.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.259
And that leads to male
mimicking genitalia.

00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:29.205
This is now used by females in
dominance signaling,

00:33:29.205 --> 00:33:32.270
and it does have some
consequences for copulation and

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.450
birth in hyenas.
 

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.637
And I think some of you have
read one of the critical papers

00:33:37.637 --> 00:33:39.200
about this scenario.
 

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.279
Okay?
 

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:43.711
So the female hyena's
reproductive tract has been

00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:45.068
heavily modified.
 

00:33:45.068 --> 00:33:48.808
Here is the embryo here,
and this is her clitoris,

00:33:48.808 --> 00:33:51.656
which has now been modified
developmentally by the

00:33:51.656 --> 00:33:54.970
over-expression of testosterone
when she was in utero,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:34:00.730
and it is used for dominance
signaling and things like that.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:07.519
This pattern--by the way,
in a group of adult hyenas,

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:10.586
there will be a dominant
female, some subordinate

00:34:10.586 --> 00:34:13.016
females,
and some males who have pretty

00:34:13.016 --> 00:34:16.119
subordinate behavior,
and it's normally the dominant

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:19.559
female who's doing most of the
reproducing in that group.

00:34:19.559 --> 00:34:21.420
So there's reproductive
suppression.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.362
And we'll now look at a couple
of other cases of reproductive

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.050
suppression.
 

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.860
One of them is in dwarf
mongooses.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.920
And this is a pretty radical
case of behavior.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.070
Okay?
 

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.206
The dominant female does most
of the breeding,

00:34:34.206 --> 00:34:36.250
and being in the group is quite
critical.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:44.010
They have packs of about eight
to twenty individuals.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.940
This is one from a big pack.
 

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.909
Okay?
 

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.420
They are voracious predators.
 

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.590
They can eat lizards and snakes
and spiders and scorpions.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.059
And this is the remarkable
thing about them.

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:59.563
If a subordinate female dwarf
mongoose has made a mistake and

00:34:59.563 --> 00:35:02.070
gotten pregnant,
and gives birth,

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.179
and she's confronted by the
dominant female,

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:08.650
she'll go get the offspring and
take them to the dominant

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.349
female,
who kills them.

00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:13.186
She goes and gets her babies
and delivers them to the

00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:14.170
dominant female.
 

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.280
Okay?
 

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.599
So this to us is really a
radical and upsetting thing;

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:24.237
and it's just about the
opposite of male suicide in

00:35:24.237 --> 00:35:25.619
red-back spiders.
 

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:29.619
Because what's going on here is
that subordinate female,

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:32.588
in this reproductive system and
under these ecological

00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:35.449
constraints,
is only going to be able to

00:35:35.449 --> 00:35:38.070
reproduce successfully in a
group;

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.235
and in order to do so she's
going to have to survive long

00:35:42.235 --> 00:35:44.989
enough to become a dominant
female.

00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:48.025
The only way she can survive is
to stay in the group,

00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:51.411
and the only way that she can
become dominant is to stay in

00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:52.929
the group a long time.
 

00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:57.432
If she goes around having
babies, she's going to get

00:35:57.432 --> 00:35:59.730
kicked out of the group.
 

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.489
She will die and her babies
will die.

00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:06.929
So if the option is either both
of us die,

00:36:06.929 --> 00:36:10.255
both me and my babies,
or only my babies die and I

00:36:10.255 --> 00:36:12.699
survive to try again another
day,

00:36:12.699 --> 00:36:16.030
then they make the best of a
bad job by doing this.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.949
Okay?
 

00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:20.135
It certainly isn't optimal,
from any interpretation,

00:36:20.135 --> 00:36:23.760
but it's probably the best that
a subordinate female can do

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.510
under the circumstances.
 

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:32.585
You wouldn't think that this
kind of thing would be going on

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:37.000
in the social life of something
that looks so fuzzy and lovable;

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.730
you know, they really are
rather cute.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:45.505
But similar things are going on
in meerkats, which are their

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:48.353
relatives;
you know, these highly social

00:36:48.353 --> 00:36:50.780
mongooses that Tim Clutton-Brock
studies.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:59.409
And it's just amazing how much
brutality and crime can be--

00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:00.980
you know, from the human point
of view--

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.972
can be packed into the head of
something that's so fuzzy and

00:37:03.972 --> 00:37:04.480
lovable.
 

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.650
So let's go back to our
original questions.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.050
What are the benefits and costs
of parental care?

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.476
Well the benefit,
of course, is offspring

00:37:14.476 --> 00:37:17.268
survival, and the cost is
parental survival.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:20.726
So we've seen with things like
lump-suckers that the males will

00:37:20.726 --> 00:37:22.400
die protecting their babies.
 

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.829
So why does it vary so much
among species?

00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:32.449
Well the payoff of having a few
well-cared for offspring versus

00:37:32.449 --> 00:37:36.800
many poorly cared for offspring
varies a lot,

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.413
and it varies a lot both
because of the incidence of

00:37:40.413 --> 00:37:44.521
predators and parasites and
diseases in the different kinds

00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.806
of environments,
and from the phylogenetic

00:37:47.806 --> 00:37:51.904
inheritance that's shaping the
biology of those particular

00:37:51.904 --> 00:37:53.268
kinds of things.
 

00:37:53.268 --> 00:37:57.815
It's not as though the
environment in which these

00:37:57.815 --> 00:38:01.510
babies are living is given by
Nature;

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.110
it's something that's been
constructed by evolution.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.364
So many things have co-evolved
to create the situation in which

00:38:08.364 --> 00:38:11.039
this payoff is either large or
small.

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:15.340
So why is it that the females
do it in some cases and the

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.489
males in others,
and both?

00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:22.726
Well whether fertilization is
external or internal is quite

00:38:22.726 --> 00:38:25.635
important;
and that really does explain a

00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:28.190
tremendous amount of what we see
in fish.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:33.219
But in things like birds and
mammals,

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:37.768
this is all tied up with social
evolution and the evolution of

00:38:37.768 --> 00:38:42.690
breeding systems and with sexual
selection and things like that.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.867
It's because in birds and
mammals everybody has internal

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:50.324
fertilization,
and it's other things that are

00:38:50.324 --> 00:38:54.150
involved in explaining who takes
care of the babies.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:58.425
Why is it that parents will
sometimes kill or neglect their

00:38:58.425 --> 00:38:59.309
offspring?
 

00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:02.335
Well, you know,
the simple explanation is the

00:39:02.335 --> 00:39:04.673
standard
adaptationist/evolutionary

00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:08.043
explanation: they do it to
increase their lifetime

00:39:08.043 --> 00:39:12.275
reproductive success,
and that means that there must

00:39:12.275 --> 00:39:16.347
be some very intriguing
tradeoffs and some very strong

00:39:16.347 --> 00:39:19.190
social and ecological
constraints;

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.045
otherwise you wouldn't see them
sacrificing direct fitness for

00:39:23.045 --> 00:39:24.880
long-term gain and fitness.
 

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.521
But exactly how that works
depends on the case under

00:39:28.521 --> 00:39:29.449
discussion.
 

00:39:29.449 --> 00:39:30.920
Okay?
 

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.280
Now humans do this, of course.
 

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.083
Humans will have spontaneous
abortions if the MHC genes of

00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:47.090
the mother and the father are
very similar to each other.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.056
So in fact the human
reproductive tract is set up to

00:39:50.056 --> 00:39:55.159
carry out this sort of thing,
and the human cultural system

00:39:55.159 --> 00:40:00.981
will cause this to happen,
with very high rates of female

00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:05.918
infanticide in cultures that
have high dowries and other

00:40:05.918 --> 00:40:09.510
reasons for favoring boys over
girls.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:16.920
So the excess of boys in China
is estimated at about 30%.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.722
So there are about 130 boys for
each hundred girls,

00:40:20.722 --> 00:40:24.681
that are recorded in China;
especially in rural China,

00:40:24.681 --> 00:40:26.500
not so much in the cities.
 

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.869
And that's what I mean by
exactly how that works depends

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:31.769
on the case under discussion.
 

00:40:31.769 --> 00:40:34.367
It can be the immune system;
it can be the inheritance

00:40:34.367 --> 00:40:37.400
pattern;
it can be the social system,

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.639
with raptors and things like
that.

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:46.980
It can be driven by food supply
and a lot of such things.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.190
Okay, so next time we'll talk
about alternative breeding

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.286
strategies, and if you're
interested I can go to lunch

00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:53.869
today.

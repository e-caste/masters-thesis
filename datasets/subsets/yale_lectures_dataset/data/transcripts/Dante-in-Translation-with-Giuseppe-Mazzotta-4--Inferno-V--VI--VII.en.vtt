00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.410
Prof: Last time I
finished--

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.280
we finished on a little note,
as you'll recall,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.786
that the detail of the garden
where the pilgrim finds himself

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.290
and meets the other poets.
 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.608
And he declares,
in a way that seems to be

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:27.399
really prideful,
on his place in this

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.350
trajectory, this literary poetic
tradition.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.822
I was emphasizing last time
that this is a detail that opens

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:43.527
for us--
opens our eyes to the ambiguity

00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:47.871
of gardens,
the ambiguity--as Dante will go

00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:53.626
on dramatizing this idea of this
ambiguity of gardens throughout

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:57.615
Purgatory especially,
and in other areas,

00:00:57.615 --> 00:00:59.320
in an oblique way.
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.770
It's not necessarily
monotonously bucolic language,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.328
this idea of the ambiguity of
gardens.

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:10.349
What are some of these
ambiguities in Canto IV?

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:15.025
We are drawn naturally to
gardens and we are drawn to

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:20.330
gardens because they reflect for
us some image of order,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.819
especially if you're traveling
through Hell,

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.840
then you do want this sort
of--you explore,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.163
you enter willfully this place
that bears the fingerprints of

00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:36.768
the human hand,
has this--it's something which

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.590
had elaborated by human beings.
 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.947
This is a divine place,
nonetheless gardens mean that

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:42.530
for us.
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.905
But at the same time they give
us a sense of security and in

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:50.242
its enclosure,
also a sense of a lordship over

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:50.910
them.
 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.025
It's something we can control,
it's something that we see and

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:56.810
where we feel we belong.
 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.138
This is exactly the temptation
that the pilgrim experiences in

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:03.099
Canto IV.
 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.760
He relaxes, and this happens to
all the heroes in the epic

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.092
tradition, when they enter
gardens they even set aside

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:13.318
their arms.
 

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:16.938
They get disarmed in more ways
than one.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:19.488
That is to say,
they come to understand that

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:22.426
they are--
this is a place of shelter,

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:26.882
a place which is so peaceful
and idyllic that one is no

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:30.436
longer--
or need not fear that one is in

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:31.120
danger.
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.598
In effect, that's where the
danger is most powerful.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:40.628
Dante experiences a danger,
the danger he experience is

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.568
that of a poetic hubris.
 

00:02:42.568 --> 00:02:46.657
He is descending into humility,
that's the trajectory of his

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:50.188
journey,
and there he rests with Homer,

00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:52.081
Virgil,
Lucan, etc.,

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.979
and he just says he feels that
he belongs--

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.650
that his high genius allows him
to be right there with them.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.994
I remind you of this little
detail exactly because it allows

00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:08.824
me to say more precisely what
the problems are that a

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:13.226
presentation of gardens,
but especially to emphasize

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:18.009
that Canto V and the drama that
is unfolded in Canto V,

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.990
a drama ostensibly of desire.
 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.991
It's a story of the great
passion of a woman,

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:29.812
one of the most famous women in
literature, Francesca,

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:33.270
has with her brother-in-law
Paolo.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.002
But, the point is that that
drama stems directly from the

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:43.160
crisis in the pilgrim's mind in
Canto IV of Inferno.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.750
In what way?
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.075
It is as if the experience of
hubris, about the celebrating

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:53.627
one's own power and prowess as a
poet, now has to confront the

00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:55.940
consequences of that claim.
 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.835
Now Dante comes literally face
to face with a reader of his

00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:03.681
poetry,
and the reader of his poetry

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:08.185
who understands his poetry in a
way that was not necessarily the

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:10.330
one intended by its author.
 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.979
You have now in Canto V the
confrontation of reader and

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.427
poet,
and we shall see Francesca is,

00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:19.896
of course,
as you remember from your

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:24.040
reading, having read Canto V,
is a great reader of text.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.254
She goes on quoting Lancelot,
not in the version of

00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:30.920
Chrétien de Troyes,
but it's a parallel version.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.259
It's the same romance,
she goes on quoting from The

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.129
Art Of Courtly Love,
this text about the art of love

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.416
by Andreas Capellanus,
and you may remember I alluded

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:47.310
to at least one of the earlier
talks,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.629
and goes on actually quoting to
Dante,

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.579
Dante's own poem in the Vita
nuova,

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:55.839
which we shall go and look at
in a while.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.040
Let's start with Canto V.
 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.610
Where are we in the poem?
 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.639
Where are we located?
 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.959
We are in the second circle.
 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.850
This--your notes will tell you.
 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.422
We're in the larger area of
so-called incontinence and I

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:11.670
really should emphasize to you
something about--

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.810
we shall look at it in more
detail further on,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.189
but something about the
topography,

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.040
the moral topography of Hell.
 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.269
What is the disposition?
 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.430
What is the distribution of
sins and sinfulness?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.259
What is actually sin?
 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.300
What are we to understand for
sin?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.163
For the time being I'll tell
you that for Dante,

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:35.149
it's the will which is the
locus of sin.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.680
You cannot really sin
intellectually;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.370
you cannot have--commit sins
with your mind.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.476
You can have your mind which
partakes and becomes an

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:47.850
accomplice of the will,
but it's primarily in the will,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.350
in the voluntary action that
you find sinfulness.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.379
That's the first thing.
 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:54.079
Where are we now?
 

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.800
In the area of incontinence.
 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.440
What does that mean?
 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.629
Well one thing,
a way of making it very simple,

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:05.800
you probably should know that
the shape,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.509
the diagram of the soul for
Dante is very classical,

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.269
very ancient,
it's really Aristotelian,

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:19.166
it's the idea of its more or
less figured as a triangle

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.836
which--
on the left side you have,

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:26.023
because it's always the left--
the will--the area of the will

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:30.079
and then on the right side you
have the area of reason.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:33.230
Where the two faculties of the
soul,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.790
there are two faculties,
like two feet of the body--

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.180
there are two faculties of the
soul that where they meet it's--

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.487
well in the Middle Ages,
using a classical term they

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:44.720
call, synteresis.
 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.829
This is the area where free
will--in other words,

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.829
in free will you have a
conjunction of both will and

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.889
reason and that's the beginning
of the moral life.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.769
It's not the end of it at all,
it's really when--

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:58.399
only when you are really free,
your will is free,

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.391
that you can start making
decisions and getting engaged in

00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:02.600
the world around you.
 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.050
Now the soul is divided into
three parts.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.012
It's a tripartite structure and
begins at the bottom,

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:11.317
it's so called--I should put it
on this side because it's a

00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:11.829
will.
 

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:15.946
The concupiscent appetites,
which is really what Francesca

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:20.132
experiences,
the incontinence lost in this

00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:24.625
form later will be gluttony,
etc., avarice,

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.230
prodigality.
 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.699
In the middle area here,
you would have the sensitive

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.845
appetite,
which is really the middle

00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:35.776
ground of Dante's Hell,
violence, the kind of

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:41.300
bestiality that takes over the
human mind,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.079
and then the third is the
rational.

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:47.367
The order, the geometry of
Hell, in a way,

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:53.536
is patterned on the order of
the soul, the idea of the soul,

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:57.509
in of course--in an inverted
form.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.759
We begin in the area of
concupiscence,

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.430
the area of lust.
 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.959
Someone was asking me what was
lust last time;

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:09.305
I think that we're going to
have some kind of understanding

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:10.278
about this.
 

00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:13.699
This is where we are in the
area of incontinence,

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:18.795
the first one is lust,
or what Dante will call with a

00:08:18.795 --> 00:08:24.480
formula: it's the area of the
sinners who have inverted the

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.163
order,
the hierarchical order of the

00:08:28.163 --> 00:08:30.050
reason and the will.
 

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.390
They have made pleasure--they
have invested pleasure with

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.190
supreme lordship over the order
of rationality.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.057
So, reason, though somehow
dimmed, is always going to be

00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:47.714
used as a rational to explain--
as a kind of way of creating

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:52.120
alibis for the passion of
Francesca.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.360
This is the way the canto
begins.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.889
The second thing that I have to
mention as we read here,

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:08.590
is the particular landscape
that Dante evokes.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.067
It's a landscape of souls that
go around, swirling around in a

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:17.480
kind and sort of circular
structure.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.703
Let me tell you a little detail
here, that you have to be

00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:24.158
careful as you read the poem
even about the directions of the

00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:24.850
pilgrim.
 

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.554
For instance,
if I were to ask you which way

00:09:27.554 --> 00:09:30.450
is Dante descending into this
spiraled Hell?

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.201
When you move into a spiral,
it's very difficult to see if

00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:35.470
you're really going left or
right of course,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.850
but he's going out of the way
that he's always going leftward.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.178
Because he's descending--and as
soon as we get to Purgatory,

00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:47.466
he goes out of the way to tell
us that he's now going

00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:49.668
rightward,
which is to say,

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:53.808
that Hell is the inverted
cosmos of Purgatorio.

00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:56.639
So it's really--he's always
going the same way,

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:00.330
only that as he goes into Hell
it's--he's going down and he's

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.129
inverted.
 

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:04.178
When he has to go from Hell to
Purgatorio,

00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:07.392
the operation is going to be
that of turning upside down in

00:10:07.392 --> 00:10:09.552
order to go finally in the
straight way,

00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:10.548
the right way.
 

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:14.105
The other detail is that the
symbolism of the circle,

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.431
which as you know,
is very ancient,

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:17.320
very old.
 

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.258
There are a number of ways of
understanding direction in the

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:23.428
Middle Ages.
 

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:26.365
For instance,
the linear direction implies

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:30.732
that of human beings were caught
in time and they are going to

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:34.168
some kind of purpose or precise
destination.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:38.754
The angels are those who circle
around the throne of God so that

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:42.393
the circle implies the
plentitude and perfection of

00:10:42.393 --> 00:10:43.340
movement.
 

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.260
Clearly, Francesca is involved,
who is caught in a world of

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.697
love,
in the passion of love,

00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:53.830
she's giving a kind of parodic
version,

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:59.570
a caricature of the circular
perfect movement of the mind,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:06.350
and of the angels around the
divinity.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.908
The spiral, which is the
movement of the pilgrim,

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.529
combines line and circle;
implies that Dante is

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:17.620
really--the mind is going in a
circular way around the

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.250
divinity, but he also has a
purpose, has an aim to reach.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.966
Here the two are--Francesca and
Paolo are going around in

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:29.682
circles, circles that will
have--and they will experience

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:30.480
no rest.
 

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.801
I think that the principle
behind this representation of

00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:39.408
desire is displacement;
desire is always a part of

00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:40.048
displacement.
 

00:11:40.048 --> 00:11:43.049
Something that Dante valorizes
greatly, that's the ambiguity of

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:43.970
Dante's thinking.
 

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.320
Desire is displacement because
in this case,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.684
Paolo and Francesca--they get
nowhere and yet it's exactly

00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:54.404
this displacement that makes us
aware that we are never where we

00:11:54.404 --> 00:11:57.216
should be,
that our hearts are always out

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:57.860
of place.
 

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.620
It's what Augustine says in
the Confessions that

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.871
the--
he begins the

00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.658
Confessions with the
awareness of his heart,

00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:08.590
he says, is unquiet,
that the idea of the

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.620
unquietness of the heart out of
place,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.070
so that's where he's enacting.
 

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.470
Dante's moving within the
larger pattern of Augustine's

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.196
thinking about desire and there
will be a lot of talk about

00:12:23.196 --> 00:12:23.928
that.
 

00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:25.292
You know what the word
"desire"

00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:27.433
by the way,
which is in English as the same

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:30.220
as it is in Italian or Latin,
you know what it means?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.967
It's linked to the stars,
to have desire is to know that

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:40.149
you are not quite sidera,
at the end de sidera,

00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:47.548
we are sort of a removal,
removed from the world of stars.

00:12:47.548 --> 00:12:50.219
It's a word that is linked,
usually its

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:54.152
"consideration,"
another word that implies that

00:12:54.152 --> 00:12:57.974
the mind moves alongside,
now you consider-- when I

00:12:57.974 --> 00:13:02.216
consider how I like suspense,
when you consider is a way of

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:04.977
moving with--
along the mind manages to move

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:07.759
with the circularity and
perfection of the sun.

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:13.240
All of this irrelevant to the
point that's at hand here.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:21.364
Dante meets--so we are in the
world of--begins this canto with

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:25.759
a number of metaphors of birds.
 

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.394
You realize that,
first of all,

00:13:27.394 --> 00:13:30.067
he starts around lines 30,
about the "hellish

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:30.940
storm."
 

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.025
It's the externalizing of the
storm inside,

00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:38.529
the inner storm,
"never resting,

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:42.808
seizes and drives the spirits
before it;

00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.678
smiting and whirling them
about," etc.

00:13:45.678 --> 00:13:48.730
It continues,
"As in the cold season,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.960
their wings bear the starlings
along the broad,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.780
dense flock,
so does that blast the wicked

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.470
spirits.
 

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.732
Hither, thither,
downward, upward,

00:13:58.732 --> 00:14:01.904
it drives them;
no hope ever comforts them,

00:14:01.904 --> 00:14:05.100
not to say of rest but of less
pain."

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.298
And then the cranes.
 

00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:09.231
And Dante asks Virgil,
"Master,

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:14.259
who are these people whom the
black air so scourges?"

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:19.359
And now we have an enumeration,
another application of the

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.580
epic--an epic device,
enumerating.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.667
The epic that has--it's always
driven by the desire for

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:32.849
totality to include all things
within the compass of its

00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:34.639
representation.
 

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:38.504
It always has the enumerative
style and now here we have a

00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:42.437
number of figures that Dante
points out--that Virgil points

00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:42.980
out.
 

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.700
And they're all queens at the
beginning.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.620
They are founders of cities.
 

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.056
Keep this in mind because I
think that part of the issues

00:14:53.056 --> 00:14:55.787
that Dante is raising,
and you can think about it,

00:14:55.787 --> 00:14:57.340
we can talk about it if you
wish,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.370
is the relationship between
eros and politics.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.750
Pleasure and the city.
 

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:10.197
Where does pleasure--what is
the place of pleasure in the

00:15:10.197 --> 00:15:12.730
economy of the city?
 

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.716
Let's see who they are,
one is the "Empress of

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:20.422
peoples of many tongues,
who's so corrupted by

00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:24.782
licentious vice that she made
lust lawful in her law to take

00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:28.700
away the scandal into which she
was brought."

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:35.178
And the emphasis of the line is
this lust becoming lawful,

00:15:35.178 --> 00:15:39.269
lust becoming public and
accepted.

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:40.961
And "she is
Semiramis,"

00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:44.240
of Assyria, "of whom we
read she succeeded Ninus."

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.345
Then the next one is Dido,
who is both Virgil's invention

00:15:51.345 --> 00:15:55.785
in many ways,
where Virgil in the

00:15:55.785 --> 00:15:59.381
Aeneid;
this is a reflection on the

00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:01.298
Aeneid as a poem of love
too.

00:16:01.298 --> 00:16:07.778
Dante can not but think about
the place of how Rome,

00:16:07.778 --> 00:16:13.730
Rome's conquest would appear to
be libido of power,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.634
libido dominandi and
yet--and he's really playing

00:16:17.634 --> 00:16:23.966
with the idea that the--
Rome or Roma as you know

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.586
is the--
what we call the--I'm going to

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:29.440
have to use this term because I
can't think of an English term,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.519
boustrophedon.
 

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.986
You know what it means,
the boustrophedon,

00:16:32.986 --> 00:16:33.450
right?
 

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.183
A boustrophedon,
it's very easy,

00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:38.990
it's a Greek term meaning a
reversal.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.984
Roma,
as in a mirror,

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:47.417
becomes Amor,
but it's--Venus is the mother

00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:48.970
of Aeneas.
 

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:54.542
So there is this idea again,
of a link and inner link

00:16:54.542 --> 00:16:58.934
between love,
or love and politics and the

00:16:58.934 --> 00:16:59.899
city.
 

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:03.331
And Virgil writes the
Aeneid, literally,

00:17:03.331 --> 00:17:04.598
as a love poem.
 

00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:07.818
That is to say,
that the ideology of Rome is an

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:12.368
ideology of--based on--of Rome,
is an ideology based on desire.

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:17.108
The idea, which Augustine will
counter by saying,

00:17:17.108 --> 00:17:21.682
yeah this is not really love,
this is lust for power and the

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:25.170
distinction that someone was
raising here,

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.018
the gentleman was raising last
time about how lust is related

00:17:29.018 --> 00:17:29.660
to love.
 

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.301
You already start seeing the
antagonism between the two of

00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:33.750
them.
 

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:37.108
Augustine, a Roman,
an African, but a Roman

00:17:37.108 --> 00:17:41.670
thinker--was really writing
about and belongs and reflects

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.588
on the great myths,
on the mythology of Rome.

00:17:45.588 --> 00:17:49.490
And for him this is true in
the Confessions,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.146
but it's especially true in
The City of God, where he

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:56.800
juxtaposes the earthly city,
Rome to the heavenly city,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.400
the heavenly Jerusalem.
 

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.480
The two cities are opposed to
each other.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.217
There he reflects on Rome as a
city based on lust for power,

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:09.794
and from that point of view,
really not different from any

00:18:09.794 --> 00:18:11.240
other empires.
 

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.140
They're all Rome,
like say the Persian Empire,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.990
the Greek claims for empire,
and what not,

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:26.118
are all part of a long sequel
of violence and imperial

00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:27.960
fantasies.
 

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.271
Dante is thinking along these
lines and we shall see where

00:18:32.271 --> 00:18:34.769
that will take him in a moment.
 

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:40.143
Then there is Cleopatra of
Egypt, Helen and the story of

00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:42.000
the fall of Troy.
 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.463
Then finally,
the story of Tristan,

00:18:44.463 --> 00:18:48.452
who as you know belongs--is
really a medieval invention:

00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:50.118
Tristan and Isolde.
 

00:18:50.118 --> 00:18:53.686
We are going to see now
Lancelot and Guinevere in a

00:18:53.686 --> 00:18:54.328
moment.
 

00:18:54.328 --> 00:18:59.626
The presence of Tristan shows
one thing, that all the heroes

00:18:59.626 --> 00:19:04.743
and heroines of antiquity are
viewed through the lenses of

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.720
medieval romances.
 

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.950
They may belong to the grand
epics of the classical world.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.488
Dante will see them through
that optic of romances,

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.400
the literature of desire.
 

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.275
"And he showed me more
than a thousand shades,

00:19:18.275 --> 00:19:20.186
naming them as he pointed,
whom love parted from our

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:20.750
life."
 

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:27.000
This is the catalog of--the
epic catalog.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.965
"When I heard my Teacher
name the knights and ladies of

00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:37.516
old times, pity came upon me,
and I was as one

00:19:37.516 --> 00:19:39.640
bewildered."
 

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.945
Now this is really the first
time that Dante introduces the

00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:47.598
notion of pity in the poem.
 

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:51.231
And we shall see by the end of
the canto, that he is going to

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:54.924
be overwhelmed by pity and he is
going to faint after he hears

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:56.558
the story of Francesca.
 

00:19:56.558 --> 00:19:59.161
He was so overwhelmed that he
fell, he says,

00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:01.400
"like a dead body"
falls.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.849
It's a fainting. It's sympathy;
maybe it's a little bit of a

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:08.750
self-recognition,
maybe it's--we shall see that

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.690
it's a way of coming to grips
with his own responsibilities,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.410
maybe some of his
responsibilities.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.967
The point I want to make there
with this pity is that you do

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.777
know,
but Dante does not know the

00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:24.548
the Poetics of Aristotle,
but he knows whatever is

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:29.009
available through Horace and he
knows quite a lot.

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:33.358
The point here is that Dante
goes on reflecting--

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:36.738
it could become a paper topic
for some of you enterprising

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:39.280
spirits,
for some of you maybe--on the

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.759
relationship within pity and
justice.

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:46.670
Throughout the poem he goes on
thinking about these two terms.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:52.125
Does justice necessarily need
pity or is there some kind of

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:57.769
justice that must learn how to
be pitiless, that has no place

00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:00.778
for this kind of compassion.
 

00:21:00.778 --> 00:21:06.022
Are they two necessarily
antagonistic or is there some

00:21:06.022 --> 00:21:10.970
way of thinking of a meeting
point between them?

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.777
This is the first time he
introduces this idea of pity,

00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:19.605
a kind of recognition;
a sense that it could be he who

00:21:19.605 --> 00:21:21.730
is in that position.
 

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.422
And he begins,
"Poet I would fain speak

00:21:24.422 --> 00:21:27.990
with these two that go together
and seem so light upon the

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.930
wind."
 

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.098
He doesn't talk to any of the
major classical figures.

00:21:33.098 --> 00:21:35.779
He chooses two people from his
own time,

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:40.250
two people from the ordinary
life around him,

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.795
two people in the--by this time
Dante may very well be living in

00:21:44.795 --> 00:21:47.608
that area of Italy which is
Ravenna,

00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:50.348
not quite Ravenna,
but in that area of Ravenna.

00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:52.410
"'Thou shalt see when they
are nearer us,

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.019
and do thou entreat them then
by the love that leads them,

00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:56.119
and they will come.'
 

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:56.798
As soon as the wind bent...
 

00:21:56.798 --> 00:22:00.298
'Oh wearied souls,
come and speak to us--

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:03.588
and speak with us,
if One forbids it not.'"

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:07.650
You realize that the name of
God is never mentioned here in

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.776
Hell,
if not as a discourse that

00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:15.858
takes place here on Earth,
but the souls in Hell will

00:22:15.858 --> 00:22:19.660
always use periphrastic
constructions,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.059
terms or phrases;
as if it would be highly

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:25.730
improper for Dante to allow
them,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.202
or even for them,
to acknowledge that which they

00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:30.992
never really acknowledged:
"now if One forbids it

00:22:30.992 --> 00:22:31.730
not."
 

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.118
Then, "as doves summoned
by desire,

00:22:34.118 --> 00:22:37.230
come with wings,
poised and motionless to the

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.029
sweet nest,
borne by their will through the

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:42.059
air,
so these left the troop where

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:42.930
Dido is."
 

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:48.787
Again, the presence of Dido
that--the Virgilian myth of Dido

00:22:48.787 --> 00:22:54.942
and also the other possibility
of Rome: Virgil is writing about

00:22:54.942 --> 00:23:00.501
the great battle between
Carthage and Rome as two ways of

00:23:00.501 --> 00:23:05.667
choosing a civilization,
two ways of deciding how one

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:10.096
should organize one,
how should one experiment with

00:23:10.096 --> 00:23:10.838
cities.
 

00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:14.450
"Coming to us through a
malignant air;

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.848
such force had my loving
call."

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:21.318
Now listen to how Francesca
speaks,

00:23:21.318 --> 00:23:24.048
"Oh living creature,
gracious and friendly,

00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:27.173
who goes through the murky air,
visiting us who stained the

00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:28.519
world with blood."
 

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:30.046
She's killed,
she was killed,

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:32.186
by the way,
by her husband,

00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:37.328
who caught Francesca and his
brother Paolo in a tryst,

00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:41.509
so it's--that's what the
allusion to the blood is.

00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:44.457
"If the King of the
universe were our friend,

00:23:44.457 --> 00:23:47.945
we would pray to Him for thy
peace, since thou hast pity of

00:23:47.945 --> 00:23:49.150
our evil plight.
 

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.548
Of that which thou pleased to
hear and speak,

00:23:51.548 --> 00:23:54.926
we will hear and speak with you
while the wind is quiet as here

00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:55.798
it is."
 

00:23:55.798 --> 00:23:59.990
Now she begins the description
of her life, where she was born.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.420
Most of the narratives in
Inferno begin with this

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.710
idea of birth.
 

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.847
You saw that in the case of
Virgil and you see it once here

00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:13.240
in the case of Francesca.
 

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.338
They begin with birth for a
number of reasons,

00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:21.807
but because birth is for Dante
the event that somehow could

00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:25.892
potentially have changed and
have imparted a different

00:24:25.892 --> 00:24:29.964
direction to the world,
or could end in nothing,

00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:32.278
as in the case of Francesca.
 

00:24:32.278 --> 00:24:36.922
Hence a great piece of
literature, but she herself did

00:24:36.922 --> 00:24:39.200
not really achieve much.
 

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.031
Now she talks about her city,
in terms that clearly contrast

00:24:43.031 --> 00:24:46.538
with this movement of the souls
caught in the storm.

00:24:46.538 --> 00:24:51.525
There they go endlessly in the
air and now she evokes the place

00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:54.420
of what she really wants is
rest,

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.250
"The city where I was born
lies."

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.285
That's the image of the
stability of a city she has

00:24:59.285 --> 00:24:59.710
lost.
 

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.145
"Where the Po,
with the streams adjoin it,

00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:03.470
descends to rest."
 

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.090
Now three tercets in Italian
all beginning with the word

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.680
love.
 

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.630
Love made into kind of
transcendent divinity.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:20.318
It is the great subject of her
experience, look at this.

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:26.400
"Love which is quickly
kindled in the gentle heart,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.420
seized this man for the fair
form that was taken from me,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.828
and the manner afflicts me
still.

00:25:32.828 --> 00:25:35.603
Love, which absolves no one
beloved from loving,

00:25:35.603 --> 00:25:38.907
seized me so strongly with his
charm that, as thou seest,

00:25:38.907 --> 00:25:40.618
it does not leave me yet.
 

00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:43.519
Love brought us to one
death."

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:45.210
What is she saying?
 

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.933
Well, a number of things,
and I really have to give this

00:25:47.933 --> 00:25:48.380
to you.
 

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.135
First of all,
she's really quoting important

00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:51.970
literature.
 

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:58.609
The first line "Love
which," the translation is,

00:25:58.609 --> 00:26:02.366
"Love which absolves no--
love which is quickly kindled

00:26:02.366 --> 00:26:05.474
in the gentle heart,"
and you know that this is

00:26:05.474 --> 00:26:09.131
really a quotation from one of
Dante's sonnets in the Vita

00:26:09.131 --> 00:26:11.630
nuova that you read,
Chapter XX.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.910
"Love,"
that's how Dante starts,

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.230
"Love and the gracious
heart are a single thing,"

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.210
and Dante quotes the poetics of
a sweet new sound.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.160
It's when it's early he says,
tells us in his poem,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.384
one can more be without the
other, one can no more be

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:29.980
without the other than one that
then can the reasoning mind

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.150
without it's reason,"
etc.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:38.286
It's clearly meant for
Francesca to flatter the

00:26:38.286 --> 00:26:43.890
sensible authorship of the poet
himself.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.990
It's part of a seductive
strategy also that she can use.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.826
The second image,
but love that does not allow

00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:56.256
anyone who loves from returning,
reciprocating the love,

00:26:56.256 --> 00:26:59.464
it really comes from the
so-called ruse of love that

00:26:59.464 --> 00:27:02.924
Marie de Champagne dictates in
Book III of The Art of

00:27:02.924 --> 00:27:06.259
Courtly Love and I
want to read this.

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:10.914
It's--the translation is not
quite--all that accurate but I

00:27:10.914 --> 00:27:15.328
think--I'm sorry I got the wrong
one, the wrong book.

00:27:15.328 --> 00:27:18.480
The Art of Courtly Love,
Book III, and these are the

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.710
famous--it ends with the rules
of love.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.080
I will--I'll explain what they
are and Rule 9 says--I can

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.814
really read some of them to you
so you have an understanding of

00:27:27.814 --> 00:27:29.318
what courtly love is.
 

00:27:29.318 --> 00:27:34.098
This is the mind of--which
applies very well to Francesca.

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:39.410
Francesca imagines herself as
really a courtly love heroine.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:43.161
She lives in the world of
kings, the God is the king of

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:46.148
the universe,
she's in the court of the king

00:27:46.148 --> 00:27:47.400
of love maybe.
 

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.192
These are some of the concerns
of the rules of love and The

00:27:51.192 --> 00:27:52.808
Art of Courtly Love.
 

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:56.720
"Marriage is no real
excuse for not loving."

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.220
It's a way of saying adultery
is the law of courtly love.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.888
"He who is not
jealous,"

00:28:02.888 --> 00:28:04.710
number 2, "cannot
love."

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.990
No one can be bound by a double
love than the boys do not love

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.009
until they arrive at the age of
maturity.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:15.548
It leaves that very unclear
what the age of maturity can be;

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:18.891
7, "when one lover dies,
a widowhood of two years is

00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:20.858
required of the survivor."
 

00:28:20.858 --> 00:28:23.923
Number 8, "no one should
be deprived of love by the very

00:28:23.923 --> 00:28:25.150
best of reasons."
 

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.307
Number 9, "no one can love
unless one is impelled by

00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:33.538
somebody else's love,"
which is exactly the line that

00:28:33.538 --> 00:28:35.990
Francesca mentions,
number 9.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.818
Why these rules of love?
 

00:28:37.818 --> 00:28:38.840
What are they?
 

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.298
What is she saying?
 

00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:42.349
What Andreas,
first of all,

00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:46.529
is doing by having these rules
of love and having--

00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:50.671
and reducing love to an art,
is a way of acknowledging that

00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:56.016
love is the most transgressive,
disruptive of all experiences

00:28:56.016 --> 00:29:00.140
and therefore it needs to be
formalized.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.390
It needs to be contained.
 

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.788
It may be part of a game,
as is perhaps the thrust of

00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:11.400
Andreas Cappellanus' thinking,
or made to be part of an

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.565
acceptable ceremony,
which is the possible reading

00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:15.700
of what is happening.
 

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.628
Francesca falls completely,
squarely within this tradition

00:29:19.628 --> 00:29:23.971
of believing that she lives in a
world of love where there is no

00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:26.038
other possible resistance.
 

00:29:26.038 --> 00:29:30.108
In effect, these tercets with
which I read to you above love,

00:29:30.108 --> 00:29:33.910
love, and love:
they are really meant to cast

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.660
love as a transcendent force
that no one can really--

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.400
that she at least,
cannot withstand.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.747
What she is doing is abdicating
the power of her will to the

00:29:46.747 --> 00:29:50.463
irresistible,
omnipotent, presence of this

00:29:50.463 --> 00:29:51.279
love.
 

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.536
It's part of a strategy,
of not acknowledging any

00:29:54.536 --> 00:29:55.690
responsibility.
 

00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:00.705
It's part of a strategy to
instead find for herself an

00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:03.640
alibi: I was made to do that.
 

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.953
The literature of yours and the
literature of Andreas

00:30:06.953 --> 00:30:09.250
Cappellanus' were filters of
love.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.432
You understand what I mean--how
in romances you always have

00:30:12.432 --> 00:30:13.420
filters of love.
 

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.426
No one is going to take the
responsibility saying well

00:30:17.426 --> 00:30:21.586
the--I had too much to drink or
I read the great poem or

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:24.460
whatever, and so I was doing
that.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.030
It's a way for Dante to show
the blindness of Francesca to

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.933
the reality of her situation,
and this--where she is,

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:39.410
a kind of unwillingness to give
up that which is really the

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.960
quality of sin and the trait of
sin: habit.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.490
Is sin in the measure in which
it has become a habit,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.239
a way of clinging to it and not
acknowledging that there may be

00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:56.529
some kind of alternative or
something different to it.

00:30:56.529 --> 00:31:00.480
So Dante goes on now,
entertaining the arguments.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.445
"When I answered I began:
'Alas, how many sweet thoughts,

00:31:03.445 --> 00:31:05.537
how great desire,
brought them to the woeful

00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:06.170
pass!'...
 

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:10.170
Then 'Francesca,
thy torments make me weep for

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.519
grief and pity,
but tell me,

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:16.083
in the time of your sweet
sighing how and by what occasion

00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:19.460
did love grant you to know your
uncertain desires?'

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.555
And she answered:
'There is no greater pain than

00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:26.111
to recall the happy time in
misery and this thy teacher

00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:28.988
knows;
but if thou has so great desire

00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:32.781
to know our love's first
root," which is a way of

00:31:32.781 --> 00:31:36.007
almost--
even that metaphor of the root

00:31:36.007 --> 00:31:38.212
of love,
the origin of love,

00:31:38.212 --> 00:31:41.880
she calls it the root of love
as if the passion,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.450
her passion were the flower of
love,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.380
"I shall tell as one may
that weeps in telling.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.388
We read one day for pastime of
Lancelot, how love constrained

00:31:55.388 --> 00:31:55.788
him.
 

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:57.618
We were alone and had no
misgiving.

00:31:57.618 --> 00:32:00.810
Many times that reading drew
our eyes together and changed

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.834
the color in our faces,
but one point alone it was that

00:32:03.834 --> 00:32:06.134
mastered us;
when we read for that the

00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:08.775
longed-for smile was kissed by
so great a lover,

00:32:08.775 --> 00:32:11.640
he who never shall be parted
from me, all trembling,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.818
kissed my mouth.
 

00:32:12.818 --> 00:32:15.910
A Galeotto was the book and he
that wrote it.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.170
That day we read in it no
farther.'

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.365
While the one spirit said this,
the other,"

00:32:23.365 --> 00:32:25.028
Paolo--
whose name means

00:32:25.028 --> 00:32:26.640
"little"
in Latin,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.213
as you know paulus,
small, "wept so that for

00:32:30.213 --> 00:32:33.595
pity I swooned as if in death
and dropped like a dead

00:32:33.595 --> 00:32:34.569
body."
 

00:32:34.569 --> 00:32:36.618
And that's the end of the canto.
 

00:32:36.618 --> 00:32:41.727
Well, we could say it's an
amazing story and we will talk

00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:44.190
about a number of things.
 

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:50.147
The first thing is that this is
a scene represented through

00:32:50.147 --> 00:32:53.230
reading, a story of reading.
 

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.368
You are aware of that, right?
 

00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:58.856
This is clearly,
she reads, they read--he says

00:32:58.856 --> 00:33:02.500
that when one day they were
reading for delight,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.838
that's probably part of the
concerns that Dante has.

00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:09.710
How should we read if we read
for delight?

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.690
They read for delight.
 

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.308
Is there some other way of
reading?

00:33:13.308 --> 00:33:17.422
Is delight--clearly it's the
constitutive elements of reading

00:33:17.422 --> 00:33:20.300
literally text,
but is there something else

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.700
that we could do along the way?
 

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.170
What is our problem really?
 

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.660
Let's continue with this idea
of reading.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.288
She's reading the story of
Lancelot,

00:33:27.288 --> 00:33:30.778
Lancelot and Guinevere,
you do know the story,

00:33:30.778 --> 00:33:35.380
it's not the story of
Chrétien de Troyes,

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.635
but you could easily go on,
if you want to write about

00:33:38.635 --> 00:33:41.461
Chrétien de Troyes
Lancelot and Canto V,

00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:42.200
you can.
 

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.669
Dante does refer to the stories
of Chrétien de Troyes

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:47.608
often in his theoretical works.
 

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:52.140
The story of Lancelot is the
story of adultery at court.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.358
Lancelot is the secret lover of
the queen;

00:33:56.358 --> 00:34:01.122
clearly out of the desire and
that says something about the

00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:04.816
nature of desire,
to really supplant the king,

00:34:04.816 --> 00:34:05.720
Arthur.
 

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.563
There's a triangle here at
stake, a triangle of desire,

00:34:10.563 --> 00:34:15.853
and Francesca imitates this
triangle and we'll talk about it

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:17.289
in a moment.
 

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:23.346
The story of Lancelot is a
story of--let me go a little bit

00:34:23.346 --> 00:34:24.599
into that.
 

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:28.300
It's the story of--like all the
stories Chrétien de

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.000
Troyes, they begin on the great
feasts of Christianity.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.065
It's, I think,
usually the Ascension,

00:34:35.065 --> 00:34:39.239
Easter, the Pentecost,
one of the great feasts.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:43.391
And the heroes are sitting
around boasting about

00:34:43.391 --> 00:34:44.539
themselves.
 

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:47.563
Not one of them is doing
anything heroic,

00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:51.039
but they all talk about how
great they were.

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:55.686
It's a little bit like the
parodic version that you have of

00:34:55.686 --> 00:35:00.253
the battle of the argument
between Ulysses and Ajax in the

00:35:00.253 --> 00:35:04.018
last book of the
Metamorphosis where they

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:08.666
talk about who is the hero
worthy of inheriting the arms of

00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:10.829
the great Achilles.
 

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:14.547
And they talk about not the
present prowess now but what

00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:15.360
they were.
 

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.797
In the story of Chrétien
clearly the idea is that the

00:35:19.797 --> 00:35:22.429
heroic age is over and done
with.

00:35:22.429 --> 00:35:26.114
And the whole romance goes on
exploring, and pondering about

00:35:26.114 --> 00:35:29.860
that which the reasons why the
heroic age may have come to an

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.360
end.
 

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.434
What it is, is that the secret
love affair between Lancelot and

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.610
Guinevere.
 

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.164
The story starts,
it goes on where they're

00:35:40.164 --> 00:35:42.659
sitting around drinking ale,
and talking,

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:46.210
a mysterious figure comes from
the outside and kidnaps the

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:46.960
queen.
 

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.657
The knights who were sitting
around don't move and

00:35:50.657 --> 00:35:55.260
everybody's expecting Lancelot
to get up and go and rescue the

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.177
queen,
but he won't out of fear that

00:35:58.177 --> 00:36:02.056
if he were to impetuous,
it would be the secret affair

00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:06.000
that he has with the queen would
probably be discovered.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.478
That hesitation,
that moral hesitation of

00:36:09.478 --> 00:36:14.175
Lancelot is really the cause
of--it's the emblem of the

00:36:14.175 --> 00:36:17.480
falling from aristocratic
virtues.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.190
There is now the intrusion of a
time,

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.710
a temporal wedge between the
thought and the action,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.400
and then of course Lancelot
would have to go on that famous

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.135
cart of shame,
exposed to the ridicule of the

00:36:29.135 --> 00:36:32.920
whole town,
before he can go on really

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.090
trying to rescue the queen.
 

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.442
This is--but if you think about
it, then Chrétien is

00:36:40.442 --> 00:36:44.869
already reflecting on the crisis
of the city in terms of the

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.369
private passion.
 

00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:49.702
Something is really gnawing at
the heart of the city and it's

00:36:49.702 --> 00:36:51.480
really the question of desire.
 

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.552
The inability to distinguish
between the public and the

00:36:54.552 --> 00:36:56.923
private,
the inability to separate

00:36:56.923 --> 00:37:00.047
somehow the two,
or find some sort of a

00:37:00.047 --> 00:37:04.630
heart--threading the line
between those two concerns.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.469
In Canto V this is really what
Francesca does.

00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:12.289
Dante's exploring reading,
so she is reading the text of

00:37:12.289 --> 00:37:17.550
Lancelot and lapses into an
imitative strategy of reading.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.940
She wants to be like the
heroine that she reads about.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.036
She refuses to take an
interpretative distance from

00:37:24.036 --> 00:37:27.630
whatever specular image:
she wants to feel like a queen.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.034
And she thinks of Paolo can be
like Lancelot,

00:37:31.034 --> 00:37:35.289
and this is exactly what we
call the mimetic quality.

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.992
It's not my term,
it's the term René

00:37:37.992 --> 00:37:41.724
Girard who has written about
this question of the imitative

00:37:41.724 --> 00:37:43.268
structure of desire.
 

00:37:43.268 --> 00:37:47.420
Between us and the object of
desire there is always the

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:52.413
presence of a mediator,
and in this case the mediator

00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:56.844
is Lancelot for Paolo,
and it is Guinevere for

00:37:56.844 --> 00:37:57.780
Francesca.
 

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.829
But there's more to this story.
 

00:37:59.829 --> 00:38:02.887
For instance,
you cannot read the story

00:38:02.887 --> 00:38:07.391
without thinking about how Dante
frames the experience of

00:38:07.391 --> 00:38:10.610
Francesca with the language of
time.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.170
Do you see how many references
there are to time?

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:19.896
There's no greater grief than
remembering happiness,

00:38:19.896 --> 00:38:24.277
a past happiness,
and this, your doctor,

00:38:24.277 --> 00:38:28.320
meaning Virgil,
knows very well.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.010
Then she starts talking about
her adventure,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.289
"we were reading one
day," remember,

00:38:33.289 --> 00:38:35.329
"that day we read no
further."

00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:38.550
It's all about time,
about the question of time as

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.889
if an experience--so what is the
problem with this idea of time?

00:38:42.889 --> 00:38:44.719
Why is Francesca understood?
 

00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:47.619
Why is her story represented in
terms of time?

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:52.873
In effect, I think Francesca
want--there's one great passion

00:38:52.873 --> 00:38:57.768
that she has and her passion is
to do away with time.

00:38:57.768 --> 00:39:02.177
She's expressing the desire
that her happiness that last

00:39:02.177 --> 00:39:03.804
year,
very briefly,

00:39:03.804 --> 00:39:07.369
a brief instance may really
last an eternity,

00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:12.297
or maybe, just maybe,
she may be expressing the wish

00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:14.021
that--
or the idea,

00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:18.641
the insight more than the wish,
that one moment of happiness is

00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:20.710
well worth an eternity of pain.
 

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:26.958
Or maybe she's just saying that
it's not too bad that the love

00:39:26.958 --> 00:39:32.389
story I had only lasted the
briefest possible time.

00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:35.230
At any rate,
all this shows is that

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.990
primarily Francesca not only
abdicated choice and not only

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.750
thought that her own will was
powerless,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.204
vis-à-vis,
the irresistible force of this

00:39:46.204 --> 00:39:49.003
transcendent idea of love,
but above all,

00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:53.590
she has betrayed the order of
necessity and time.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:59.610
Her passion violates the order
of time.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.829
Above all, from this point of
view,

00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:07.369
Dante goes on reflecting about
his responsibilities of an

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:09.793
author--
as an author when he's

00:40:09.793 --> 00:40:11.849
confronted with the reader.
 

00:40:11.849 --> 00:40:13.260
What have I done?
 

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.079
What have I written?
 

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:19.208
That what I write has been
understood in a way that is not

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.889
necessarily the one that he
meant,

00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:26.300
the meaning that he meant to
assign to the Vita nuova.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.630
These are some of the concerns
and we can find some others.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:34.029
Let me just pass onto Canto VI,
which is really not completely

00:40:34.029 --> 00:40:37.130
unlike what we have been
describing here.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:43.637
Now we go into canto--Dante
goes--that's another part of

00:40:43.637 --> 00:40:46.239
this other strategy.
 

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:49.380
Whatever Dante has found out
about passion,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.614
about desire,
about this in the world of

00:40:53.614 --> 00:40:59.911
appetites and whatever he has
decided about himself and the

00:40:59.911 --> 00:41:05.340
meaning that this may have for
him as a poet,

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.929
and that scene of fainting at
the end,

00:41:07.929 --> 00:41:12.360
he will go on--this will become
the premise for other concerns

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.067
raised in Canto VI,
which as you know,

00:41:15.067 --> 00:41:16.420
is a political canto.
 

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.650
This is the strategy of Dante.
 

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.239
Let me see, I found out certain
things about me,

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:26.099
my responsibility,
I found some things about the

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:30.063
disruptive quality of desire,
vis-à-vis,

00:41:30.063 --> 00:41:34.509
the political order,
now let me find out--let me see

00:41:34.509 --> 00:41:37.652
if--
let me find out how authentic

00:41:37.652 --> 00:41:39.510
this finding may be.
 

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.817
Let me move into a public
realm, so we go from the world

00:41:42.817 --> 00:41:45.733
of the court,
the private world of Francesca,

00:41:45.733 --> 00:41:48.320
now to literally the world of
the city,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.067
the world of Florence where we
are still talking about

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:56.097
incontinence in a different
form: the question of gluttony

00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:57.300
and politics.
 

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.338
And let's see--so he takes
elements that he has already

00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:04.480
anticipated here in Canto V,
the political,

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.369
and goes on thinking about
politics in Canto VI.

00:42:08.369 --> 00:42:12.467
Here we go then with Canto VI,
the third circle,

00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:13.949
the gluttonous.
 

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:18.740
"With return of my mind,
with the return of my mind that

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.030
was shut off when the piteous
state of the two kinsfolk,

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.099
which was quite confounded me
with grief,

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:29.130
new torments and new souls in
torment I see about me,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.320
wherever I move and turn and
set my gaze."

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.686
I find first of all the
presence of the word mind,

00:42:37.686 --> 00:42:44.260
in Italian it is mente,
in line 1, very suggestive.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.849
We are dealing here now with
bodies.

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:51.315
Canto VI is all about bodies:
it's all about gluttonous souls

00:42:51.315 --> 00:42:54.739
who were bodies who took care of
the bodies.

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:58.579
Dante uses as a counterpoint
the question of mind,

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:03.219
as if the sin of these bodies,
the sin of these gluttonous has

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:07.250
also been the sin of not
thinking in terms of mind.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.193
The mind is a necessary
counter, a necessary compliment

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:13.239
to the presence of bodies.
 

00:43:13.239 --> 00:43:15.108
The word mind,
of course as you know or in

00:43:15.108 --> 00:43:16.619
Italian--
in English we have

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:19.199
mental,
in Italian it's mente,

00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:21.541
Latin mens,
really comes from the Latin for

00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:22.018
measure.
 

00:43:22.018 --> 00:43:26.483
The mind is that which measures
things, the mind is that which

00:43:26.483 --> 00:43:30.510
gives a sense of the measure of
even our own desires.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.690
The metaphor of mind appears
throughout Canto VI.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.740
We are asked to think of that
which is missing in this

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.717
biological reflection,
a reflection about the--what I

00:43:42.717 --> 00:43:45.239
call the biology of politics.
 

00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:49.460
Politics now reduced to the
question of appetites of bodies.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.335
It's not--normally we have the
pride of minds when we think

00:43:53.335 --> 00:43:56.809
about all the people who have
whatever fantasies,

00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:58.849
whatever megalomanias,
whatever desires,

00:43:58.849 --> 00:44:01.960
but mental above all when we
talk about politics,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.309
but here it's really a question
of politics in terms of the

00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:09.010
inexhaustible appetites of
bodies.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.335
We are going to talk about
politics and gluttony,

00:44:13.335 --> 00:44:15.320
politics and bodies.
 

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.530
Dante here meets the figure
that is presiding;

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.710
the mythological figure that is
presiding over this canto,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:27.192
this area of gluttony is the
classical figure of the

00:44:27.192 --> 00:44:31.778
three-headed Cerberus,
a way of hinting about the

00:44:31.778 --> 00:44:35.891
voraciousness,
the many mouths of this

00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:37.960
monstrous animal.
 

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.101
"Cerberus,
a beast fierce and

00:44:40.101 --> 00:44:41.789
hideous"
and so on.

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:48.079
And we do know that the
landscape is stinking under an

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:52.992
endless rain;
there are hints that this is

00:44:52.992 --> 00:44:59.034
really one of--some kind of
repulsive form of waste and

00:44:59.034 --> 00:44:59.929
food.
 

00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:04.072
"The rain makes them howl
like dogs, and the profane

00:45:04.072 --> 00:45:08.438
wretches often turn themselves,
of one side making a shelter

00:45:08.438 --> 00:45:09.768
for the other.
 

00:45:09.768 --> 00:45:13.280
When Cerberus,
the great worm perceived us,

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.639
he opened his mouths and showed
us the fangs,

00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:19.050
not one of his limbs keeping
still and my Leader."

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.860
And so on.
 

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.827
"As the dog that yelps for
greed and becomes quiet when it

00:45:23.827 --> 00:45:26.231
bites its food,
being all absorbed and

00:45:26.231 --> 00:45:29.329
struggling to devour it,
such became these foul visages

00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:30.679
of the demon Cerberus...
 

00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:35.179
We passed over the shades that
were beaten down by the heavy

00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:39.603
rain, setting our feet on their
emptiness which seemed real

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:40.900
bodies."
 

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.391
This is actually the great--the
description and figuration of

00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:47.400
gluttony.
 

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:53.789
Bodies that are always empty
and they are empty now.

00:45:53.789 --> 00:45:56.550
They are punished to be empty,
as empty forms;

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.130
and they seem--they are not
bodies, they seem real bodies.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.012
"They were all lying on
the ground except one who sat up

00:46:03.012 --> 00:46:05.030
as soon as he saw us passing
before him.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.985
'O thou who art led through
this hell,' he said to me,

00:46:08.985 --> 00:46:13.148
'recall me if thou canst;
thou wast begun before I was

00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:16.219
ended.'"
Another little reference to

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:20.594
birth, the birth of Dante and
the death of--it's part of a

00:46:20.594 --> 00:46:21.440
cycle.
 

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.139
There's no necessary connection
between the three heads.

00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:28.099
The death of--the name is
Ciacco, meaning a pig,

00:46:28.099 --> 00:46:31.626
that's the way he was surnamed
in the streets of Florence and

00:46:31.626 --> 00:46:34.090
the death--
and the birth of the pilgrim.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.599
"I said to him,
'The anguish--

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:39.253
the anguish thou hast perhaps
taken thee from my memory,"

00:46:39.253 --> 00:46:42.697
and the word is mente,
the mind, "so that I do

00:46:42.697 --> 00:46:44.500
not seem ever to have seen thee.
 

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.320
Tell me who you are,
put in a place of such misery

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.083
and under such a penalty that,
if any is greater,

00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:51.579
none is so loathsome.'
 

00:46:51.579 --> 00:46:53.931
And he said to me,
'thy city,"

00:46:53.931 --> 00:46:57.876
we are talking about Florence,
this is the politics of the

00:46:57.876 --> 00:46:58.500
city.
 

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.699
"Thy city,"
it doesn't say our city,

00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:02.869
your city.
 

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:07.719
He's already--Ciacco views
himself as outside of it,

00:47:07.719 --> 00:47:10.300
not really occupying a place
within the city,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.800
"which is so full of envy
that already the sack runs over,

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.230
held me within it in the bright
life,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.061
when you citizens,"
once again the distance of

00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:23.820
Ciacco from the city of
Florence,

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.219
"called me Ciacco.
 

00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:28.467
For the damning fault of
gluttony, as thou seest,

00:47:28.467 --> 00:47:32.063
I lie helpless in the rain;
and in my misery I'm not alone,

00:47:32.063 --> 00:47:34.802
for all these are under the
same penalty for the same

00:47:34.802 --> 00:47:35.329
fault.'
 

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:37.849
And he said no more."
 

00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:42.920
Okay here I have to stop a
little bit to tell you what--

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.130
something that you already
caught of course,

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:49.597
what the basic metaphor,
what the basic conceit is in

00:47:49.597 --> 00:47:53.318
this canto,
and it's the conceit of the

00:47:53.318 --> 00:47:55.090
city and the body.
 

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.824
You--in the classical world
you're used to the conceit

00:47:58.824 --> 00:48:01.447
between--
of the correlation between the

00:48:01.447 --> 00:48:04.338
soul and the city,
but for Dante this is a

00:48:04.338 --> 00:48:05.420
soulless city.
 

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.512
The only way to talk about is
through this image which is very

00:48:08.512 --> 00:48:10.940
ancient,
very Roman actually,

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.590
the story of the city as a
corporate,

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.260
as a body, as a corporate
structure.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.221
The image, some of you readers
of Shakespeare you may remember

00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:25.472
your Coriolanus,
where Coriolanus makes the same

00:48:25.472 --> 00:48:28.449
speech about the city and the
body.

00:48:28.449 --> 00:48:32.449
But it really goes back to a
historian of the classical world

00:48:32.449 --> 00:48:34.449
that Dante absolutely loves.
 

00:48:34.449 --> 00:48:37.904
He's not the only one,
all the way Augustine is

00:48:37.904 --> 00:48:40.632
using--
the name is Livy who wrote this

00:48:40.632 --> 00:48:43.969
famous book about from--
about the--from the foundation

00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:47.132
of Rome,
a Roman historian who tells the

00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:48.559
history of Rome.
 

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:53.735
One of the stories he tells is
that of the famous civil war in

00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:59.079
Rome: the civil war between the
patricians and the plebeians.

00:48:59.079 --> 00:49:01.259
The plebeians,
the workers,

00:49:01.259 --> 00:49:05.449
were so tired of what was
happening in the city.

00:49:05.449 --> 00:49:08.909
They were doing all the work;
that's the way they complained,

00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:13.126
but they had few of the
pleasures coming from living in

00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:16.250
the city that they decided to
secede.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.409
It is the famous secession
whereby they go--

00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:22.300
it's a kind of schism,
they go on the--

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.994
they retreat on the Aventine
Hill, one of the seven hills of

00:49:24.994 --> 00:49:26.521
Rome,
and the patricians,

00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:29.150
the city is paralyzed as you
can imagine,

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.550
it's a strike,
the patricians send one of

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:32.922
their--
an emissary,

00:49:32.922 --> 00:49:36.882
a man by the name of Menenius
to convince the plebeians to

00:49:36.882 --> 00:49:38.409
return to the city.
 

00:49:38.409 --> 00:49:43.893
Menenius manages to do this by
telling the plebeians a famous

00:49:43.893 --> 00:49:48.371
fable which called,
is still known as The fable of

00:49:48.371 --> 00:49:49.559
Menenius.
 

00:49:49.559 --> 00:49:50.820
What does he tell them?
 

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.579
He said, look,
the city's really like a body.

00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:56.440
When you have a body the hands
work.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.264
Yes, it seems that the mouth
enjoys and savors the great

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:02.420
pleasures of foods and so on.
 

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.280
It seems that the stomach can
be full,

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.443
but actually whatever they
produce and take in and they

00:50:07.443 --> 00:50:09.706
ingest,
they redistribute to the body,

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:13.219
to the rest of the body,
to the hands, the feet, etc.

00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:15.780
The city is like a body.
 

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.768
That's the analogy.
 

00:50:16.768 --> 00:50:19.090
Between the corporate structure
of the city,

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.940
the idea that the city is a
corporation and--

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.199
which by the way we carry on a
reminder of this,

00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:28.849
how vital this is,
we carry on a dime.

00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:32.849
I don't have a dime with me,
but if you have a dime you can

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:34.920
read e pluribus unum.
 

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.981
And it says one body out of
many limbs, out of many members,

00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:39.590
still an image that we carry.
 

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.179
It's still a conceit that we
have, right?

00:50:42.179 --> 00:50:48.315
The idea is that the city is
like a body and plebeians are

00:50:48.315 --> 00:50:54.451
convinced and they go back to
order and they recompose the

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.820
order of the city.
 

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.349
This is the fundamental
structure here.

00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:03.717
I said something else which is
really is going to--does Dante

00:51:03.717 --> 00:51:06.469
believe in the corporate
structure of the city?

00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:12.097
Can it really hold together and
I go on submitting to you that

00:51:12.097 --> 00:51:15.050
he no longer believes in this.
 

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.251
If you--when you read the canto
you will see that all the body

00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:23.659
parts are literally littering
the city, they're all mentioned.

00:51:23.659 --> 00:51:28.849
The nails, the hands,
the heart, the beard,

00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:31.985
the hair, etc.,
the mouth are sort of spread

00:51:31.985 --> 00:51:35.106
all over,
and as if to imply the

00:51:35.106 --> 00:51:41.336
impossibility of constituting
these body parts into an organic

00:51:41.336 --> 00:51:43.380
unified totality.
 

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.954
There's another little issue
here that is being raised and

00:51:46.954 --> 00:51:50.215
that I want to talk about before
the end of the hour:

00:51:50.215 --> 00:51:53.978
the question of civil war and
what Dante understands by civil

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:56.800
war because Dante's political
thought,

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.179
the reality of his political
thinking is always the civil

00:52:01.179 --> 00:52:01.650
war.
 

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.835
Let me just give you some
textual evidence and then we'll

00:52:04.835 --> 00:52:05.289
go on.
 

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:09.692
"I answered him Ciacco,
thy distress so weighs on me

00:52:09.692 --> 00:52:11.500
that it bids me weep.
 

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.898
But tell me if thou canst,
what the citizens of the

00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:17.889
divided city,"
this is now Florence,

00:52:17.889 --> 00:52:21.579
"shall come to and whether
any there is just,

00:52:21.579 --> 00:52:25.500
and tell me the cause of such
discord assailing it."

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.936
An amazing image discord
because it's a musical metaphor:

00:52:29.936 --> 00:52:32.746
accord,
discord but it really comes

00:52:32.746 --> 00:52:36.782
from--it makes the 'heart,'
that's where the word comes

00:52:36.782 --> 00:52:39.902
from;
discord makes the heart the

00:52:39.902 --> 00:52:45.601
place, the receptacle where all
the envy, all these jealousies

00:52:45.601 --> 00:52:50.179
that destroy the city are
placed, are located.

00:52:50.179 --> 00:52:53.108
"He said to me,
'After a long strife this shall

00:52:53.108 --> 00:52:56.612
come to blood and the party of
the rustics shall drive out the

00:52:56.612 --> 00:52:59.869
other with much offense;
then by force of one who is now

00:52:59.869 --> 00:53:01.731
maneuvering,"
meaning the Pope,

00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:04.179
"that party is destined to
fall."

00:53:04.179 --> 00:53:09.007
This is the Guelfs and
Ghibellines that--within which

00:53:09.007 --> 00:53:11.050
the city is divided.
 

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:14.260
"To fall within three
years and the other to prevail,

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.750
long holding its head high and
keeping the first under grievous

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.820
burdens,
for all their tears and shame.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.579
Two men are just and are not
heeded there.

00:53:22.579 --> 00:53:25.635
Pride, envy and avarice,"
these are the cause,

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:28.630
these are "the
sparks" he calls them.

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:31.577
"'These are the causes
that have set these hearts on

00:53:31.577 --> 00:53:32.000
fire.'
 

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.179
Here, he made an end of his
grievous words."

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:41.931
And then Dante goes on
literally evoking a street scene

00:53:41.931 --> 00:53:48.005
in Florence, goes on asking
about some other characters in

00:53:48.005 --> 00:53:49.389
the city.
 

00:53:49.389 --> 00:53:52.963
"I would still learn from
thee and I beg thee to grant me

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:53.960
further speech.
 

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.342
Farinata,"
he mentions about whom we shall

00:53:57.342 --> 00:54:01.018
see next Thursday in Canto X of
Inferno,

00:54:01.018 --> 00:54:03.518
"Tegghiaio,
men of such worth,

00:54:03.518 --> 00:54:06.880
lacopo Rusticucci,
Arrigo, and Mosca and the rest

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.539
whose minds were set on
well-doing,

00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:12.320
tell me where they are and give
me knowledge of them;

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.228
for I'm pressed with a great
desire to know whether they

00:54:15.228 --> 00:54:17.766
share in Heaven's sweetness,
or the bitterness of

00:54:17.766 --> 00:54:18.559
Hell."
 

00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:23.338
I would like to point out to
you the presence of this--of the

00:54:23.338 --> 00:54:27.639
language of gluttony throughout:
sweetness, bitterness,

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:29.949
pleasant, unpleasantness.
 

00:54:29.949 --> 00:54:34.827
This really runs through the
canto and gives its--and links

00:54:34.827 --> 00:54:37.940
together gluttony and the
politics.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.574
It's the body:
you can see the body metaphor,

00:54:40.574 --> 00:54:42.670
but also these other
experiences.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:46.405
What is happening here he asks,
as Dante asks about these other

00:54:46.405 --> 00:54:48.815
famous Florentines,
the "men of such

00:54:48.815 --> 00:54:49.780
worth"?
 

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.219
He says, where are they?
 

00:54:51.219 --> 00:54:54.965
They achieved so much worth,
so set on well-doing in the

00:54:54.965 --> 00:54:58.780
city and the English cannot
quite render the ambiguity of

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.869
the Italian.
 

00:54:59.869 --> 00:55:02.813
The ambiguity of the Italian is
benfare which is really

00:55:02.813 --> 00:55:05.885
very difficult to translate,
which you don't know if it

00:55:05.885 --> 00:55:09.155
means "doing well"
or "doing good,"

00:55:09.155 --> 00:55:12.244
and that impossibility of
deciding what the sentence

00:55:12.244 --> 00:55:15.820
really means is exactly what
Dante's dramatizing here.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.619
What he's dramatizing is the
distance between human

00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:21.536
perspective,
the judgments that we make as

00:55:21.536 --> 00:55:25.224
human beings,
and the divine judgment on the

00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:29.059
dealings and doings of these
famous people;

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:32.311
the discrepancy between them
here on earth when they judge

00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:34.777
one way,
then the real--the reality of

00:55:34.777 --> 00:55:38.074
the worth and value of these
other people that can be

00:55:38.074 --> 00:55:38.900
different.
 

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.300
We are talking about--he's
talking about them,

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.436
the black souls,
that is to say they're further

00:55:45.436 --> 00:55:49.458
down in the fire and different
faults weigh them down to the

00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:50.139
depth.
 

00:55:50.139 --> 00:55:54.798
What an extraordinary metaphor,
the weight, the burden of sin,

00:55:54.798 --> 00:55:58.771
but it's really an image that
goes back, the gravity,

00:55:58.771 --> 00:56:00.909
the question of gravity.
 

00:56:00.909 --> 00:56:04.146
This is--we speak of civic
gravity, but here it's a

00:56:04.146 --> 00:56:05.960
different kind of gravity.
 

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.550
It's an idea of--it's an old
idea.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:16.322
When you want to talk about the
weight that we carry within us,

00:56:16.322 --> 00:56:21.349
the gravity we have within us,
that gravity is love.

00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:24.456
The way of deciding,
the way of understanding this

00:56:24.456 --> 00:56:27.688
line: there's a passage in
the Confessions of

00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:30.398
Augustine,
where Augustine says,

00:56:30.398 --> 00:56:34.670
that he wants to exemplify why
some people go up,

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:38.654
other people go down,
and he says it's like the

00:56:38.654 --> 00:56:41.340
gravity of objects around us.
 

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:46.963
A stone, you drop a stone and
the stone goes down out of its

00:56:46.963 --> 00:56:50.679
own gravity, its own specific
weight.

00:56:50.679 --> 00:56:54.918
A fire, he says,
goes up out of its own specific

00:56:54.918 --> 00:56:55.730
weight.
 

00:56:55.730 --> 00:57:00.050
We are carried wherever our
love carries us.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:03.731
We are--our love is our own
gravity, inner gravity,

00:57:03.731 --> 00:57:07.853
and whether we go up or down,
it depends according to the

00:57:07.853 --> 00:57:09.989
direction of our desires.
 

00:57:09.989 --> 00:57:13.663
Let me just go back to--this is
to give you a sense of all the

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:16.648
resonances of this canto,
but at the heart of it all,

00:57:16.648 --> 00:57:18.380
there is the question of civil
war.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.139
Between Guelfs and the
Ghibellines,

00:57:20.139 --> 00:57:23.027
between patricians and
plebeians: Dante sees the whole

00:57:23.027 --> 00:57:24.782
of history,
Roman history,

00:57:24.782 --> 00:57:27.409
whether he is going to read
Virgil,

00:57:27.409 --> 00:57:30.880
or will read Lucan,
or he will read Statius,

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.501
which actually deals not with
Roman history in this great epic

00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:36.789
the Thebaid.
 

00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:39.590
He reads--he's really
reading Greek history,

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:42.630
the story of Oedipus and
Eteocles and Polyneices.

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:47.159
They view history from the
point of view of the civil war.

00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:51.251
Let me just formulate the
question of the political

00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:53.380
understanding Dante has.
 

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.615
For those of you who may have
read a little bit of

00:57:55.615 --> 00:57:57.657
Monarchia,
for instance,

00:57:57.657 --> 00:58:02.860
which is the treatise about the
desirable form of a universal

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.525
confederation of states,
under the one emperor:

00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:09.900
that's the grand vision that
Dante has in Monarchia.

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.150
He thinks about the needed
unity of all states,

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.909
a kind of sort--we could call
it today,

00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:21.126
a confederation of states,
very much patterned on the

00:58:21.126 --> 00:58:22.920
Roman Empire.
 

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.548
The idea of the--in fact the
Roman Empire becomes the model

00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:28.489
for this kind of unification.
 

00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:32.297
That's really what most of us
think that Dante's political

00:58:32.297 --> 00:58:33.099
vision is.
 

00:58:33.099 --> 00:58:37.769
In effect, Dante sees history
especially as--and it's kind of

00:58:37.769 --> 00:58:41.039
inevitable--a satanic form of
civil war.

00:58:41.039 --> 00:58:45.920
So harsh is he going to be
about the realities of the

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.978
cities,
that you really wonder how can

00:58:48.978 --> 00:58:51.449
he go on elaborating a theory
of,

00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:53.273
a constructive theory,
of politics.

00:58:53.273 --> 00:58:54.670
You see what I'm saying?
 

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:58.123
Once you are so harsh about the
reality of politics,

00:58:58.123 --> 00:59:02.119
then you really wonder how can
one go around really thinking

00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:04.489
that politics can be necessary.
 

00:59:04.489 --> 00:59:07.552
It's necessary that you can
explain, that it's somehow

00:59:07.552 --> 00:59:09.230
useful, that it's feasible.
 

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:15.333
Where does it say--where does
this understanding of Rome come

00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:16.250
to him?
 

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:19.099
Dante does not really agree
with Virgil.

00:59:19.099 --> 00:59:23.175
And Dante does not agree with
Virgil's greatest critic who is

00:59:23.175 --> 00:59:26.639
Augustine in The City of
God. For Virgil,

00:59:26.639 --> 00:59:31.666
Rome is the providential
empire, an empire that can

00:59:31.666 --> 00:59:35.739
really bring about,
unify the whole world.

00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:39.849
Augustine writes against Virgil
and says,

00:59:39.849 --> 00:59:43.074
no because even Rome,
as I just indicated to you a

00:59:43.074 --> 00:59:46.420
little earlier,
even Rome is part of the

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.309
history of violence.
 

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:52.398
Dante comes along and pulls
together within the Divine

00:59:52.398 --> 00:59:56.779
Comedy the question of Rome
and the needed empire and the

00:59:56.779 --> 00:59:58.969
question of the civil war.
 

00:59:58.969 --> 01:00:02.460
What do they have in common?
 

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.179
What is it that connects them?
 

01:00:04.179 --> 01:00:07.659
Dante's argument is the
following: you,

01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:15.389
Virgil, are right in believing
in the unity of all mankind,

01:00:15.389 --> 01:00:18.679
a Stoic idea that we all live
in a cosmopolis,

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:22.157
in a city which is the city of
the world where we all find a

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:22.630
place.
 

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:28.306
And you, Augustine,
are right in claiming that the

01:00:28.306 --> 01:00:34.679
empire is all built and based on
the libido and lust.

01:00:34.679 --> 01:00:36.927
You're right;
you are both right,

01:00:36.927 --> 01:00:39.197
and yet you are both wrong,
precisely because you

01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:40.380
contradict each other.
 

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.047
What Dante says to Augustine,
if there is no empire,

01:00:45.047 --> 01:00:50.539
then we are living in a world
of disorder and lawlessness.

01:00:50.539 --> 01:00:55.523
The empire becomes the
necessary remedy to the evils of

01:00:55.523 --> 01:00:57.000
the civil war.
 

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.862
The civil war is the condition
where my own brother,

01:01:00.862 --> 01:01:04.119
my own neighbor,
can become my own enemy.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:07.909
Augustine does not acknowledge
the reality of civil war.

01:01:07.909 --> 01:01:11.260
To him, it's just empire and
the empire is evil.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.001
And we'll finish with the
famous line: what do I care who

01:01:16.001 --> 01:01:20.320
governs me, provided that they
don't make me sin?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.233
It's the famous Christian
response to the idea of the

01:01:24.233 --> 01:01:27.170
evil, the historical evil of
empires.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:33.052
Let me retreat into myself and
find within myself some kind of

01:01:33.052 --> 01:01:36.429
comfort and some kind of
shelter.

01:01:36.429 --> 01:01:39.655
And Dante will respond to him,
says no that's not enough

01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:43.115
because once you think that you
have retreated into yourself

01:01:43.115 --> 01:01:46.753
then there is the reality of the
civil war that will reach into

01:01:46.753 --> 01:01:47.340
you.
 

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.617
What I have been explaining to
you and I will stop because I

01:01:50.617 --> 01:01:53.172
want to talk about something
else before we go,

01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:53.949
Canto VII.
 

01:01:53.949 --> 01:01:57.235
What I've been trying to
explain to you is that the

01:01:57.235 --> 01:02:00.849
movement from Canto V to Canto
VI of Inferno,

01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:04.996
it's a movement from the
internal world of desires that

01:02:04.996 --> 01:02:08.070
seem to be so private and so
personal.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.501
Then, I said,
Dante has to go outside of

01:02:10.501 --> 01:02:12.746
himself to test,
to find out what the

01:02:12.746 --> 01:02:16.239
authenticity is of what he has
found out in Canto V.

01:02:16.239 --> 01:02:19.157
In Canto VI,
the political canto will tell

01:02:19.157 --> 01:02:23.639
them there is no such comfort
zone of one soul in the world,

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:27.393
that the inner world is
necessarily part of the outside

01:02:27.393 --> 01:02:31.565
world and the outside world will
encroach upon it and it will

01:02:31.565 --> 01:02:33.789
enter one's own inner world.
 

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:38.090
The terms for this kind of
movement between the inner and

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:41.469
the outer are really Virgil and
Augustine.

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:45.327
Virgil with the idea of the
defense of the empire,

01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:50.052
Augustine with his undermining
of the notion of the necessity

01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:51.469
of the empire.
 

01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:56.420
Dante will go on harmonizing
the two visions.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.911
He will endorse the idea of the
empire, aware that that's the

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:05.329
only possible best response to
the tragedy of civil wars.

01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:10.146
Let me say just a few things
about Canto VII and then I'll

01:03:10.146 --> 01:03:13.780
give you a chance to ask some
questions,

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.690
there should be two or three
minutes for questions.

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:20.643
Canto VII also is a canto that
can be read symmetrically with

01:03:20.643 --> 01:03:24.525
the other Canto VII of the
Divine Comedy,

01:03:24.525 --> 01:03:28.159
Purgatorio VII,
just as Canto VI.

01:03:28.159 --> 01:03:31.940
I neglected to mention it,
but Canto VI of Inferno

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.630
is about the city and
politics;

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:36.860
Canto VI of Purgatorio
about the nation;

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.054
Canto VI of Paradise
about the empire,

01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:41.829
so they're really connected;
the same thing with Canto VII.

01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:45.920
This is the only canto that's
not individualized sinners.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.753
He meets avaricious,
the avaricious and the

01:03:48.753 --> 01:03:51.148
prodigals,
and they are sort of taken in a

01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:53.135
kind of--
they have no--there's no

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:55.130
individual figuration for them.
 

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:59.000
It is as if this became a kind
of an anonymous,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.739
therefore a more collective
kind of problem,

01:04:01.739 --> 01:04:05.766
avaricious and prodigality,
which he represents in terms of

01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:09.099
the counter movement of Scylla
and Charybdis,

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:12.400
and here we have the great
figuration of Fortune.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.139
You remember as I call her the
Vanna White of the time,

01:04:17.139 --> 01:04:21.070
the lady who is at the Wheel of
Fortune,

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:25.824
turning blindfolded and let me
say something about this

01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:26.969
figuration.
 

01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:32.760
Dante describes it as--what is
it?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.951
It's a great--an idea that
I--what is it about the

01:04:36.951 --> 01:04:41.570
avaricious and the prodigals who
could turn around,

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:48.199
so one against the other,
how can this be possible?

01:04:48.199 --> 01:04:55.219
What is--why are we so attached
to the things of the world?

01:04:55.219 --> 01:04:58.927
And then Dante goes on
explaining on Canto VII,

01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:02.070
lines 80 and following,
he will say,

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:05.340
"He ordained them,"
He meaning God,

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.280
"for them for worldly
splendours,

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.563
a general minister and guide
who should in due time change

01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:14.003
vain well from race to race,
and from one to another blood

01:05:14.003 --> 01:05:16.170
beyond the prevention of human
wits,

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:19.550
so that one race rules and
another languishes according to

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.559
her sentence...
 

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.844
She foresees,
judges, and maintains her

01:05:22.844 --> 01:05:25.789
kingdom as the other heavenly
powers do theirs.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.889
Her changes have no respite.
 

01:05:27.889 --> 01:05:31.195
Necessity makes her swift,
so fast men come to take their

01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:31.610
turn.
 

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:34.746
This is she who is so
reviled,"

01:05:34.746 --> 01:05:37.530
meaning Fortune,
"by the very men that

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:40.478
should give her praise,
laying on her wrongful blame

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:41.570
and ill repute.
 

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.679
But she is blest and does not
hear it.

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:47.532
Happy with the other primal
creatures she turns her sphere

01:05:47.532 --> 01:05:49.829
and rejoices in her bliss."
 

01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:55.059
It's Fortune at the wheel,
but it's a figuration that in

01:05:55.059 --> 01:05:58.579
many ways it needs some
explaining.

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:04.539
How can Dante believe in God as
Fortuna?

01:06:04.539 --> 01:06:09.271
How can he go on talking about
this pagan deity,

01:06:09.271 --> 01:06:13.802
she is Roman deity,
Lady Luck, how is he doing

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:14.710
this?
 

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:18.090
How can that--do you see how he
lives in a world of

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:21.878
providentiality where there is
well--and he does say that

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.449
Fortune is an intelligence of
God.

01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:26.112
That is to say,
not the--though she's

01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.224
blindfolded;
there is also a kind

01:06:28.224 --> 01:06:31.958
of--there's some criteria,
there is an intelligence,

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:35.400
there is a will,
and a meditation behind it.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.766
What it means is that what is
up will inevitably turn down to

01:06:40.766 --> 01:06:44.969
go down, it's an endless
rotation of fortune.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:49.025
In a certain way when you are
down you only--the only--it's

01:06:49.025 --> 01:06:52.590
the best time to be at,
because you only get to--you

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:53.920
can only go up.
 

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.496
We are always though on
the--precariously poised on

01:06:58.496 --> 01:07:00.420
this--on the curve.
 

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.610
We are never quite stable in
our own achievements.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:09.181
How can Dante relate this
fortune--idea of fortune to the

01:07:09.181 --> 01:07:13.507
providential scheme that
he--that regulates and shapes

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:15.059
his own vision?
 

01:07:15.059 --> 01:07:18.880
What I would have to tell you
is that the--two things.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.264
The first thing is that as you
see, Canto VII begins with an

01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:26.090
illusion to the great war in
Heaven.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:31.324
The angels, the primal struggle
that disrupted the order of the

01:07:31.324 --> 01:07:33.349
cosmos,
in other words,

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:38.070
Fortune is for Him the divinity
that rules over the world,

01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:41.250
this sublunary world of
generation of corruption.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.739
That is to say,
she is a minister within the

01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:47.420
world of the fall,
first thing.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.938
There is still a fallen world
and that's how perception of all

01:07:51.938 --> 01:07:54.159
the changes that take place.
 

01:07:54.159 --> 01:07:58.130
And the other thing is,
that Dante is intimating that

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:02.329
the only way to conquer Fortune
is to really give up.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:04.699
It's a kind of mystical idea.
 

01:08:04.699 --> 01:08:06.956
Mystical in the sense of a
spiritual idea,

01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:10.369
that is, give up the attachment
to the things of this world.

01:08:10.369 --> 01:08:16.850
Let's stop here with the
briefest summary of Canto VII.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.369
Let me see if there are
questions about some of the

01:08:20.369 --> 01:08:23.819
weighty issues that I raised in
Canto V and VI.

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:27.846
And there is much more that we
can say, but let me,

01:08:27.846 --> 01:08:32.519
if you want to ask questions
and maybe I can qualify things

01:08:32.519 --> 01:08:35.500
that were left in the
background.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.810
Please?
 

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:43.520
Student:  In Canto V,
&gt;?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.390
Prof: The question is a
very good question,

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:49.911
what is the significance of
Francesca doing all the talking

01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:51.859
and not Paolo,
I guess.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.640
I take the significance is that
this is--

01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.661
to me is that this is a canto
where Dante understands some of

01:09:00.661 --> 01:09:05.850
the elements that he had put
forth in the Vita nuova.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.630
You remember where we discussed
the Vita nuova?

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:11.118
There I indicated that the
great poem,

01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:13.511
"Women who have intellect
of love,"

01:09:13.511 --> 01:09:17.112
where the--
he discovers that they are the

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:19.618
interlocutors about love.
 

01:09:19.618 --> 01:09:22.122
Not only are they the
interlocutors about love,

01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:24.896
there are also those--the
privilege of interlocutors

01:09:24.896 --> 01:09:26.908
because they know how to
combine;

01:09:26.908 --> 01:09:30.997
because they understand the
necessary independence of

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:32.649
intellect and love.
 

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:35.158
They are not two separate
entities,

01:09:35.158 --> 01:09:38.720
they are not two separate
aspects, and therefore,

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.806
now he has Francesca as a woman
who can become indeed his own

01:09:44.806 --> 01:09:46.328
interlocutor.
 

01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:49.402
That's one aspect,
the other one is that medieval

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:52.666
romances had made this
extraordinary discovery and I

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:56.056
think that it's the most
revolutionary change that has

01:09:56.056 --> 01:09:58.810
taken place in the consciousness
of--

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:02.615
in the imagination of the--in
the Western world in modern

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.158
times.
 

01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:06.061
That is to say,
before it became a sociological

01:10:06.061 --> 01:10:07.862
issue,
before it becomes a

01:10:07.862 --> 01:10:12.060
philosophical problem,
the dignity and worth of the

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:17.340
woman was already retrieved and
vindicated by romances.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:22.141
It's there that the woman
becomes either the figure in

01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:26.310
charge or the partner,
or friend of the man.

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.729
Does that answer your question?
 

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:30.590
Student: 
&gt;

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.109
Prof: By the way the
answer was yes.

01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:36.930
That could not be picked up by
the video.

01:10:42.909 --> 01:10:44.329
Other questions?
 

01:10:55.729 --> 01:11:00.042
Well, okay thank you,
we'll see you next time with

01:11:00.042 --> 01:11:02.770
Canto IX, X, and XI,
I guess.

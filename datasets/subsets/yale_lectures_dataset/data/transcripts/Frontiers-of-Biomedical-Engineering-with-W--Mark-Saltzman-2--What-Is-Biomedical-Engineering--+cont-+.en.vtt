Professor Mark
Saltzman: What I'm going to

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.751
talk about today is to continue
our discussion about what is

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.162
Biomedical Engineering and go a
little bit further and we'll

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.960
spend about half the class doing
that,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.262
and then I want to spend the
last half of the class talking

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:28.907
about some biological structures
that are very important and that

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:32.572
you might not be familiar with.
I'll talk about biological

00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:35.660
membranes and lipids and how
they're assembled.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.126
But first, I want to start with
the assignment I gave you last

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.478
time, and I asked you all to
think about these two questions

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:46.568
and write some things down.
Let's start with the first,

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:50.527
with A on this list here.
What products of Biomedical

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:52.690
Engineering have you
encountered?

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.066
We talked about a few of these
last time but I'm sure there's

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:01.005
others, so what things did you
come up with as you were

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.610
thinking, anybody?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.778
Student:
[inaudible]

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:17.645
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Okay,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:23.645
so in the category of already
available: drug delivery

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.103
patches.
These are now available for a

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:30.204
variety of drugs,
Scopolamine for motion sickness

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:34.080
was one of the first that was
available and nitroglycerin for

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.698
treating heart disease is
already available and these are

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.993
really like band-aids but
they're band-aids that are

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:44.804
loaded with drugs and they're
designed in such a way that if

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.810
you apply this band-aid with
adhesive to your skin,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.992
drug will enter your
bloodstream from the band-aid

00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:54.330
through the skin,
and that's been,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.930
I think, a good example.
Others?

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.769
Student:
[inaudible]

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.012
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Dissolvable

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:10.387
stitches or sutures,
now what needs to be engineered

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:11.380
in those?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.393
So they have to be engineered
to be inert so that they can be

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:20.981
safely inside a system and
there's not every material you

00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.830
could pick would have that
property.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.392
It's - a suture or a stitch has
to hold the wound closed so it

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.012
has to have certain mechanical
strength and imagine the problem

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:33.399
of making something that's
dissolvable so it disappears but

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.786
also is strong enough to hold a
wound closed reliably for a

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:42.800
length of time.
Others?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.072
Student:
[inaudible]

00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:45.943
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Arthroscopic

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:47.740
surgery - what are you thinking
about there?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.687
Student:
[inaudible]

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:55.493
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Yeah,

00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:56.543
so you're thinking about the
instruments that they use in

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.897
arthroscopic surgery,
arthro means 'joint',

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:02.724
scopic means 'looking',
so it's looking into a joint

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:06.684
and these are instruments that
have very fine sort of needles

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:09.053
on the end,
but also cameras in them,

00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:12.151
and you can put them inside a
joint and then look around and

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:15.960
see what's happening inside.
And not just a camera but there

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.111
are also tools on the end of
these things so you can cut and

00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.770
you can do manipulations through
this instrument,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.189
so that's a great example also.
Yeah?

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.644
Student:
Hearing

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:33.001
aidsProfessor Mark
Saltzman: Hearing aids -

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:34.680
that's a good one,
others?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.654
Student:
[inaudible]

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:40.190
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Cochlear implants,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.522
so that's the same kind of
function as a hearing aid,

00:03:45.522 --> 00:03:49.624
to improve hearing,
but using a different

00:03:49.624 --> 00:03:52.607
mechanism.
Not just an amplification

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:56.320
system that you put in your ear,
but actually an implant that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.600
replaces the function of an
organ inside your ear.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.330
That's a good example, others?

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.174
Must be a couple of others -
yeah--Student:

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:15.373
[inaudible]
Professor Mark

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:17.060
Saltzman: contact lenses.

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:28.484
Student: Lasik
surgeryProfessor

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:32.364
Mark Saltzman:
Lasik surgery - now why

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:37.389
that one, what makes you think
of that as an example?

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.913
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.730
Mark Saltzman:
Instruments,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.177
it involves lasers and learning
how to make lasers that can do

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:50.660
the right amount of damage to
tissue,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.543
right?
Because that's what the laser

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:54.850
is doing in the surgery is
cutting like a knife would do,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.441
but doing the right amount of
damage and controlling it with

00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.640
light is an advance there.
Others?

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.338
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:05:09.338 --> 00:05:12.875
Mark Saltzman: Tissue
culturing - now what has to be

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.010
engineered in tissue culturing?

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.694
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:21.160
Mark Saltzman: I beg your
pardon?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.005
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:31.432
Mark Saltzman: So what
kinds of engineering do you

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:34.936
think goes on behind that?
Student:

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.693
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman: The

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:38.482
technology that they use and
really there's quite a lot of

00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.397
technology here starting from
the plates that you grow them in

00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:42.500
turn out to be engineered so
they have the right properties.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.780
And we're going to talk about
this more when we talk about

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.460
cell culturing later,
and we'll talk about lots of

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.690
potential applications of that
as well.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.511
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:05:56.511 --> 00:06:00.066
Mark Saltzman: Dialysis -
and this is a method to replace

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:02.550
or augment the function of your
kidneys,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.535
to remove waste products really
from the blood,

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:08.780
which is something the kidney
does continuously.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.553
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:06:17.553 --> 00:06:22.420
Mark Saltzman: Cosmetic
surgery - you gave two examples,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.640
one was Botox and the other was
liposuction.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.763
So two different kinds of
strategies, one is a surgical

00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:38.608
strategy, actually removing
tissue and we talked a little

00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:41.605
bit about the engineering of
surgical instruments and things

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:44.552
like - so there's a lot of
Biomedical Engineering that goes

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:47.550
into everything that happens in
the operating room.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.403
Botox is an injection of a
molecule, or a complex molecule

00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:56.150
but a molecule,
so in what ways would that be

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.450
Biomedical Engineering?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.797
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:21.757
Mark Saltzman:
Right and I think all of

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:22.675
those are good,
so there's lots of different

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.051
ways.
One is in terms of how you

00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.774
deliver the molecule so it goes
where you want it to go and not

00:07:26.774 --> 00:07:29.290
where else you want it to go.
And that's an engineering

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.909
problem that we're going to talk
a lot about, how to deliver

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:34.129
drugs so that you get the action
that you want,

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.750
at the site that you want and
not the toxicity.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.208
If you delivered Botox all over
your body that wouldn't be a

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.875
good thing, it might not even be
a good thing if you delivered it

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.106
one place in your body,
but it's definitely not good if

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:46.471
you deliver it everywhere.
So controlling the dose is

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:49.435
really important and that's
going to turn out to be very

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:52.454
important in cancer therapy
because these are very potent

00:07:52.454 --> 00:07:55.795
drugs that will have bad effects
in other sites and you want to

00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:59.025
localize them where they want,
so we're going to talk about

00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:00.884
that.
I think this is as good

00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:04.604
list so let's go and think about
what might be a little bit more

00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:09.313
challenging.
So in the future what things do

00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:16.466
you think Biomedical Engineering
is going to produce in the

00:08:16.466 --> 00:08:19.509
future?

00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:40.265
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:46.072
artificial hearts that can
be used long term and that is a

00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:51.500
- there's probably several
elements to that.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.743
One is long term,
making them compatible with the

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:58.190
body so that you could tolerate
it for long term.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.743
And the other thing means if
it's going to be long term,

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:05.360
than probably it has to be
implantable and that means all

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.879
of the heart has to be
implantable.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:11.373
This is where we don't have
something that satisfies both of

00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:14.863
those categories right now.
Imagine how much power it takes

00:09:14.863 --> 00:09:18.295
to drive an artificial heart,
so you've got to have a battery

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:21.899
or some way of generating power
continuously to operate that and

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:25.503
that makes it difficult to think
about implantable and so that's

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:28.650
a really good example of
Biomedical Engineering.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.770
Student:

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.730
Mark Saltzman:
Food supplies - food from

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.540
cloned animals.

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:47.317
We're going to talk about
cloning next week,

00:09:47.317 --> 00:09:51.280
but why would cloning be an
advantage in producing food?

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.986
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:09:56.986 --> 00:09:59.018
Mark Saltzman:
Controlling quality because

00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:01.304
cloned animals are all
genetically identical and so you

00:10:01.304 --> 00:10:03.039
wouldn't have variability that
way,

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:08.241
and so potentially you could
have - pick an individual that

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:13.623
has a really good quality meat
and always reproduce that same

00:10:13.623 --> 00:10:14.520
thing.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.441
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:28.688
Mark Saltzman:
Genetic scans for disease

00:10:28.688 --> 00:10:29.470
predictions,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.440
and we talked about one way you
might do that using gene chips.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.362
Last time we talked very little
about that and so we'll talk

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:41.164
more about that next week,
but certainly technology is

00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:43.940
going to be available,
but there's going to need to be

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.559
ways developed to put this
technology together.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:49.647
If we looked at all 30,000
genes that were important in

00:10:49.647 --> 00:10:53.250
each individual how do you pick
out which ones are important for

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.867
a particular disease?
Or what - and often it's not

00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:58.200
going to be just one gene,
it's going to be combinations

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.471
of genes,
and how do you predict the fate

00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:03.993
of the individual based on all
of the genes that you know to be

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:06.720
involved in progression of a
certain disease.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.875
So it's not just knowing what
genes or figuring out ways to

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:13.363
look at gene expression,
it's figuring out how this

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:18.149
expression of key genes affects
the fate of the individual.

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:23.807
That's really a complex systems
problem, the kind of problems

00:11:23.807 --> 00:11:28.240
that engineers are very good at
dealing with.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.230
Others?

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:35.728
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.631
Mark Saltzman: So I'm
going to call that chips

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:39.460
implanted in the brain to
control prosthetics,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.020
but I'm going to make it a
little bit more general and call

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.188
a brain-machine interface.
So it's some way of interfacing

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:50.899
activity in your brain with the
outside world,

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.478
and we'll talk about this as we
go along, but there's lots of

00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:57.818
reasons to think that we're
going to have this in the not

00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:59.190
too distant future.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:07.399
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.731
Mark Saltzman:
Spinal cord regeneration -

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:17.622
that's a good one.
Student: Organs that

00:12:17.622 --> 00:12:22.107
can be cultivated
…[inaudible]

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:29.457
Professor Mark
Saltzman: Organs grown from

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.700
single cells.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:43.481
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:46.768
Mark Saltzman:
I didn't hear the last

00:12:46.768 --> 00:12:50.896
partStudent:
[inaudible]Professor

00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:54.259
Mark Saltzman:
Imaging of moving parts

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:58.540
like the - like a joint or
another moving part that might

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.049
be interesting to look at in
motion is the heart.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:07.250
If you could image how the
heart is moving,

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.450
you would know a lot about its
function.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.729
You could potentially learn a
lot about its function by

00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:15.924
looking at how it moves,
not just a static picture of

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:18.740
it.
There's lots of parts of our

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.250
bodies that move,
the lungs for example,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.220
and so yeah that's a good one.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:34.379
Two
more--yeah--Student:

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:39.203
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:13:39.203 --> 00:13:45.234
artificial pancreas - now
how are you thinking that might

00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:46.340
work?

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:02.157
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:04.139
Mark Saltzman:
So maybe - and here

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.111
thinking about the pancreas has
many functions but one of its

00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:09.490
important functions is to
secrete insulin.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.769
So diabetics have lost that
normal function.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:17.674
What if you could take just a
pump that's capable of

00:14:17.674 --> 00:14:21.809
continuously administering
insulin at various rates and

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:26.479
connect it to a sensor that's
able to continuously measure the

00:14:26.479 --> 00:14:30.431
sugar level in your blood?
Insulin is important for

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:33.059
regulating levels of sugar in
your blood.

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:36.501
Well if you can continuously
measure and then give the amount

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.426
of insulin you need to
compensate for that amount of

00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:41.572
blood,
those things could work

00:14:41.572 --> 00:14:44.579
together to be a totally
artificial pancreas,

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:47.450
make it totally out of
synthetic parts.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.511
Now another approach would
be to take pieces of the

00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:56.100
pancreas that already have all
that capability within them.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.756
Individual cells of the
pancreas are capable of - of a

00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:03.552
healthy pancreas are capable of
both sensing glucose and

00:15:03.552 --> 00:15:06.847
secreting insulin.
So what if you could take cells

00:15:06.847 --> 00:15:09.887
from a healthy individual and
put them into a diabetic

00:15:09.887 --> 00:15:13.594
individual?
Then maybe those new cells you

00:15:13.594 --> 00:15:18.628
put in would function as a
totally natural artificial

00:15:18.628 --> 00:15:23.440
pancreas.
Now why isn't that done?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.350
Why doesn't that already work,
do you think?

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.644
What are the engineering
problems to overcome to get that

00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:33.590
to work?

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.045
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:43.363
Mark Saltzman:
The same problem is with

00:15:43.363 --> 00:15:46.454
organ transplantation is that
the recipient has to be matched

00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:48.669
to the donor and so that's a
problem.

00:15:48.669 --> 00:15:53.289
That's a big problem and so can
you protect these cells that you

00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:57.543
give to the recipient from
attack by the recipient's immune

00:15:57.543 --> 00:16:01.019
system?
That's one challenge and we'll

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:06.446
talk about ways to think about
engineering approaches to solve

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:08.768
that problem.
One

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:14.928
more--Student:
control of angiogenesis

00:16:14.928 --> 00:16:18.906
within…
[inaudible]Professor

00:16:18.906 --> 00:16:21.513
Mark Saltzman:
control of angiogenesis,

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:25.164
and angiogenesis - angio
means 'blood' and genesis

00:16:25.164 --> 00:16:28.640
means 'new' and so angiogenesis
is a development of new blood

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.818
vessels.
Many people believe that

00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:37.590
tumors, most tumors require
blood vessels in order to grow.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.091
If a tumor starts to grow and
it doesn't develop a vascular

00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:43.990
supply it doesn't develop blood
vessels in it,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.937
then it can't get bigger than a
certain size and there's lots of

00:16:46.937 --> 00:16:49.509
evidence from many cancers
showing that this is true.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.692
So if you could stop a tumor
from being able to develop blood

00:16:52.692 --> 00:16:55.875
vessels you might be able to
stop its growth at a stage where

00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:58.846
it's not harmful.
In fact, I don't know if in the

00:16:58.846 --> 00:17:02.139
news the pioneer in this is a
man named Judah Folkman,

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:06.447
who is a surgeon who first
speculated that this was

00:17:06.447 --> 00:17:09.980
important, and sadly he died on
Monday,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.579
but had a dramatic impact on
our understanding of how cancers

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.920
develop in people and new
approaches.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.030
So there already are some
approaches like this that are

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.910
working, but there's more that
needs to be done.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.691
So of these things that are
up here, are any that seem

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:29.671
controversial to you or that you
would have said wasn't on my

00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:33.850
list and I wouldn't say that
that's Biomedical Engineering?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.169
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:17:38.169 --> 00:17:40.916
Mark Saltzman:
Controversial in what

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:43.792
sense?
Student:

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:49.409
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:56.663
Controversial in the sense
that maybe it's not a good thing

00:17:56.663 --> 00:17:59.529
to do,
or there might be some limits

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:02.742
on what we want to do there in
terms of integrating machines

00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:06.726
with people's brains.
I think that's probably right,

00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:12.077
and there might be some others
here where there might be some

00:18:12.077 --> 00:18:17.430
concerns, or others that have
kind of concerns like that.

00:18:30.099 --> 00:18:31.353
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:18:31.353 --> 00:18:32.431
Mark Saltzman:
So there's some issues

00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:33.559
about how these technologies
might be applied,

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.256
right?
If you had genetic scans that

00:18:35.256 --> 00:18:38.001
were available for disease
prediction, do you want to know

00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:40.457
everything that's going to
happen to you in terms of

00:18:40.457 --> 00:18:43.365
susceptibility to disease?
Well, probably you want to know

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:46.059
some of it but you might not
want to know all of it right?

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:49.036
You might not want to know all
of it and that's a really

00:18:49.036 --> 00:18:52.120
complicated question for an
individual to figure out and a

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.880
complicated question for society
to figure out,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.210
what you want to make of
available in the regard.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.278
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:11.062
Mark Saltzman:
If you can start to predict

00:19:11.062 --> 00:19:13.143
you're going to have heart
disease that starts to develop

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.150
when you're 45 and you're
looking to buy insurance when

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.145
you're 30,
or you're looking for a job

00:19:17.145 --> 00:19:19.844
when you're 30 and that
information is available to your

00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:21.710
insurance company or your
employer,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:28.294
that could have dramatic
effects on the choices that you

00:19:28.294 --> 00:19:32.108
get to make.
So that's really - these are

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:35.009
really difficult questions to
answer.

00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:39.150
We'll talk about - we'll raise
these issues as they come up.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.568
We'll try to raise them with
all the technologies,

00:19:41.568 --> 00:19:44.183
we won't try to answer them,
there are probably better

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.950
people at Yale to answer those
kinds of questions than I am.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.937
We'll talk about the technology
and the questions that it brings

00:19:49.937 --> 00:19:52.688
up, but I hope some of you get
interested and these will be

00:19:52.688 --> 00:19:55.486
good topics to think about for
term papers as well for those

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:57.619
you that have that kind of
inclination.

00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:59.936
But any that seem like
controversial or like,

00:19:59.936 --> 00:20:02.727
‘I don't think that's
Biomedical Engineering' or

00:20:02.727 --> 00:20:06.150
‘that's not what I want to
learn about in this course'.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.095
Let me put it that way;
I hope we don't spend a week

00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:11.738
talking about that one because
that's not what I thought

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:13.180
Biomedical Engineering was.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.030
Any of these or do they all
seem on the mark?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.700
Yeah?
Student: Food from

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.684
cloned animals
Professor Mark

00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:35.613
Saltzman: Food from cloned
animals - you didn't expect that

00:20:35.613 --> 00:20:38.600
to be Biomedical Engineering?
So why?

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:55.099
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:56.746
Mark Saltzman:
I think - I see where you

00:20:56.746 --> 00:20:58.858
wouldn't see - I see where you
would put it in that category

00:20:58.858 --> 00:21:01.150
and how you would be surprised
to put it in that category.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.853
It should be in the category
because it's engineering to be

00:21:04.853 --> 00:21:06.450
able to do this,
right?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.254
It's a biological system that
you've engineered from taking

00:21:09.254 --> 00:21:11.961
cells from one organism and
cloning them and developing a

00:21:11.961 --> 00:21:15.640
whole other organism.
And it's also engineering that

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.369
helps humans,
right?

00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:21.330
Because nutrition is going to
be one of the big problems of

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.493
your generation;
how to have enough nutritious

00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:26.960
food for the population as it
grows.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.988
Even to understand what
individuals should eat,

00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:32.832
what should I be eating?
That's a really complicated

00:21:32.832 --> 00:21:34.930
question that we have gotten
very confused about.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.903
In large part because our
government has confused us about

00:21:38.903 --> 00:21:41.970
it, but it's a confusing
question to know.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.119
I think engineers have a role
to play in that,

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:49.250
but it's not sort of classical
Biomedical Engineering in the

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.819
way that developing an
artificial heart is where you

00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:56.434
can see that.
But I think it's a good example

00:21:56.434 --> 00:22:00.414
of a place where biomedical
engineers of the future are

00:22:00.414 --> 00:22:03.870
going to contribute.
So I want to try to put

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.653
this together into a form that
I've come to understand what

00:22:07.653 --> 00:22:10.980
Biomedical Engineering is and
present it to you.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.980
Not only am I not an ethicist
and I'm not good at those kinds

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.180
of problems, I'm not much of an
artist either.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.192
So this is a person - you can
recognize it as a person,

00:22:22.192 --> 00:22:25.089
but let's say it was a person a
long,

00:22:25.089 --> 00:22:31.261
long time ago and there was a
point when one person decided to

00:22:31.261 --> 00:22:36.623
take instruments that were
around them and use them to

00:22:36.623 --> 00:22:40.683
improve their life.
Somebody thought about a wheel,

00:22:40.683 --> 00:22:43.759
or some group of people
discovered how to use a wheel,

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:46.456
some a knife,
and some levers and these were

00:22:46.456 --> 00:22:50.218
very useful things in improving
the quality of their life and

00:22:50.218 --> 00:22:53.980
that was - that's who you would
call the first engineer.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.507
Then some - it couldn't have
been too long after those

00:22:57.507 --> 00:23:00.319
instruments became available,
but somebody,

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:02.911
let's call them the first
biomedical engineer,

00:23:02.911 --> 00:23:05.735
decided to use those
instruments to look at either

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:08.040
themselves or probably more
likely,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.674
their neighbor.
Take a knife and open up the

00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:12.269
skin and let's see what's
inside.

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:15.099
How do these fascinating things
around me work?

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:19.436
So people started turning these
machines they developed on

00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:23.240
themselves to try to understand
how they worked.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.154
This is one aspect of
Biomedical Engineering,

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.555
developing tools that allow you
to understand how human's

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:33.320
function and what's wrong when
they have disease and so some of

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.660
the things we've talked about
have that category.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.952
Arthroscopic surgery in one
sense is a fancy example of

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:45.721
that, a way of looking inside a
joint to see what's happening

00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:50.650
inside while the person is alive
and without hurting them.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:24:00.242
Imaging of moving parts that
same way is sort of advance in

00:24:00.242 --> 00:24:03.344
that.
As these tools became applied

00:24:03.344 --> 00:24:06.831
more and more widely,
we learned more about how human

00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.122
physiology worked.
As we learned about how humans

00:24:10.122 --> 00:24:14.074
operate we could start to design
machines that would help humans

00:24:14.074 --> 00:24:16.710
when they weren't functioning
properly.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.003
I think the simplest example
was that once we learned that

00:24:20.003 --> 00:24:22.950
there were bones or hard
elements inside the leg,

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.135
and that those bones were
important in keeping the leg

00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:28.420
straight so that you could stand
up,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.188
then somebody could invent an
artificial bone,

00:24:31.188 --> 00:24:34.880
a splint that would be wrapped
around - that would be secured

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.572
to the outside of the leg to
give you mechanical support even

00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:42.079
after you fell out of a tree and
you broke you leg.

00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:46.119
So this is another kind of
engineering, an engineering not

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:50.158
to look more closely at how
humans work but an engineering

00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:53.559
to improve their function when
it's failing.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:56.544
As time goes on,
we've developed ever more

00:24:56.544 --> 00:25:00.657
complex machines to study people
and we've talked about some of

00:25:00.657 --> 00:25:02.779
these already:
EKG machines,

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:06.464
so an example of an electrical
device that can be used to

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:10.279
monitor a very elaborate
function deep inside your body,

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:13.150
the beating of your heart and
the rhythm of your heart.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.204
We talked about modern imaging
methods and this is an example

00:25:17.204 --> 00:25:20.781
of an fMRI, a functional MRI;
a map of the brain that not

00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:23.633
only shows you the anatomy of
the brain but shows you

00:25:23.633 --> 00:25:26.869
something about the chemistry of
what's going on inside.

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:31.247
You can put somebody in an MRI
machine now and have them read a

00:25:31.247 --> 00:25:35.342
book and look at what parts of
their brain become activated

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:39.578
when they're reading and what
parts stop activating when they

00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:43.193
stop reading,
so you can learn where in their

00:25:43.193 --> 00:25:46.606
brain is reading done.
You can ask them to read French

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:50.060
and to read Spanish and you can
find different locations in the

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.124
brain that are involved in
processing of those different

00:25:53.124 --> 00:25:55.945
languages.
These are really incredible

00:25:55.945 --> 00:25:59.623
tools for understanding deep
inside the body what's

00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:02.194
happening.
We can even understand it on a

00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:05.663
molecular or cellular level now.
This is a picture of patch

00:26:05.663 --> 00:26:09.246
clamp, it's a device that
engineers built to fasten onto

00:26:09.246 --> 00:26:12.894
individual cells in order to
look at how molecules in the

00:26:12.894 --> 00:26:15.369
membrane of the cell are
working,

00:26:15.369 --> 00:26:19.130
and I'll talk a little bit
about that as we go along.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.026
We can understand down to a
very fine level now because of

00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:26.960
machines that we've built.
As our understanding is

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.617
improved and we've been able to
build more complicated

00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:34.779
approaches to replacing
function.

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:38.458
We talked about the artificial
hip which is a modern precursor

00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:40.750
of the splint I talked about
before.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.946
Much more sophisticated in
terms of the materials that are

00:26:43.946 --> 00:26:47.029
required and the design thinking
that goes behind it.

00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:50.651
So now somebody can get an
artificial hip and they can live

00:26:50.651 --> 00:26:54.147
for many decades with it and
have almost full function of

00:26:54.147 --> 00:26:56.519
that hip over that period of
time.

00:26:56.519 --> 00:27:01.768
This is an example of a
rudimentary brain machine

00:27:01.768 --> 00:27:05.039
interface.
It's a device called a deep

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:08.376
brain stimulator,
developed by a company called

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:11.087
Medtronic,
and it looks like a pacemaker

00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:13.220
that's implanted inside your
body.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.695
Here is as pacemaker and this
pacemaker does the same thing

00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:19.631
that a heart pacemaker does,
it generates periodic

00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:22.678
electrical signals.
But instead of those signals

00:27:22.678 --> 00:27:25.299
going to your heart they go into
the brain.

00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:28.698
They go through these wires and
into these electrodes that are

00:27:28.698 --> 00:27:31.150
deep in your brain,
and they stimulate tissue

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.330
inside the brain.
We've found that stimulation,

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.628
electrical stimulation deep in
the brain can help patients that

00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:42.926
have Parkinson's Disease and can
reduce the tremors and loss of

00:27:42.926 --> 00:27:46.322
muscle control that many
patients with Parkinson's

00:27:46.322 --> 00:27:49.355
Disease use.
Now these are electrodes that

00:27:49.355 --> 00:27:52.724
are only sending out signals.
They're producing electrical

00:27:52.724 --> 00:27:56.025
signals in the brain--they're
not recording from the brain,

00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.359
but it's not that big of a
difference.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:03.046
It won't be long before we're
using these same kind of devices

00:28:03.046 --> 00:28:07.425
to both record--to test what's
going on--and to act in the

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:11.574
right way and response.
This is a beginning of real

00:28:11.574 --> 00:28:14.569
interface between machines and
brains.

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:17.638
Dialysis,
this is an example of a

00:28:17.638 --> 00:28:21.506
membrane dialysis unit.
Dialysis is done millions of

00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:24.730
times per day in this country
and around the world,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.258
and keeps people alive when
their kidneys have failed and

00:28:28.258 --> 00:28:31.849
they wouldn't survive for even a
week without dialysis.

00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:35.258
You can keep people alive for
many decades with periodic

00:28:35.258 --> 00:28:38.420
dialysis to remove waste
products from the blood.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:45.263
We'll talk about these examples.
What I want to leave you with

00:28:45.263 --> 00:28:49.449
is my picture,
not a very elaborate picture,

00:28:49.449 --> 00:28:55.680
of what Biomedical Engineering
is to me, and two parts of it.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.319
One, developing ways to
understand how humans work

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:02.289
better, how human physiology
operates,

00:29:02.289 --> 00:29:06.964
and second, developing new
approaches for replacing

00:29:06.964 --> 00:29:10.609
function in people when they're
sick.

00:29:10.609 --> 00:29:14.707
I want to talk about - move
on and talk a little bit about

00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:18.201
some general concepts from
physiology that are really

00:29:18.201 --> 00:29:22.299
important and here is a table
that gives characteristics of an

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:26.221
average person.
This would be an average adult

00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:30.490
male, 30 years old,
the average height and weight,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:34.943
and surface area and
temperature, and lots of

00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:38.890
characteristics of an average
person.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.930
Let's think about some of these
like weight.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.998
We think a lot about weight in
this country,

00:29:46.998 --> 00:29:52.296
but weight is a remarkably
carefully controlled parameter

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:55.700
of a person,
that is, you have to work

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.180
pretty hard to gain weight or to
lose weight.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.435
We take in a lot of food and
water everyday,

00:30:02.435 --> 00:30:06.749
every year, and yet most of us
our weight stays remarkably

00:30:06.749 --> 00:30:11.367
stable over that period of time
for adults despite how much we

00:30:11.367 --> 00:30:15.192
eat and how much we drink.
Your body is able to regulate

00:30:15.192 --> 00:30:18.190
your weight fairly well without
you really thinking about it.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.407
Anybody - you're all too young
to have tried to lose weight

00:30:21.407 --> 00:30:24.457
yet, but when you get to be
older and you start to think

00:30:24.457 --> 00:30:26.509
about as your metabolism
changes,

00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:29.802
trying to control your weight,
you realize how hard it is to

00:30:29.802 --> 00:30:32.982
do, and you know this because
people spend a lot of energy

00:30:32.982 --> 00:30:36.750
thinking about it.
Weight is remarkably well

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:41.730
controlled if you let your body
do its business.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.103
Also, temperature,
you could measure your

00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:47.232
temperature and you'd find
variations throughout the day or

00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:51.268
maybe some throughout the year,
but within a remarkably narrow

00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:53.990
range your temperature is
controlled.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.954
When you go from here to going
outside, to going to a much

00:30:56.954 --> 00:31:00.075
hotter room, your temperature
stays the same and your body is

00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.000
able to control this on your
own,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.769
you don't have to think about
it.

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:07.210
In fact, temperature is such a
carefully controlled parameter

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.191
that when it changes just a
little bit by a couple of

00:31:10.191 --> 00:31:12.849
degrees,
we know that something's wrong.

00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:16.224
You measure your temperature is
a little up, you've got a fever,

00:31:16.224 --> 00:31:19.227
'something's wrong,
I better find out what that is'

00:31:19.227 --> 00:31:22.740
because temperature is a very
highly controlled variable.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.831
You could go through a lot
of these parameters and think

00:31:25.831 --> 00:31:28.817
about it in the same way that
these things are really very

00:31:28.817 --> 00:31:33.085
highly controlled.
Well that process of control to

00:31:33.085 --> 00:31:38.009
maintain a constant environment
inside our body,

00:31:38.009 --> 00:31:41.228
whether it's an environment of
constant mass or constant

00:31:41.228 --> 00:31:43.510
composition, or constant
temperature,

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.006
is called homeostasis.
Your body has elaborate

00:31:47.006 --> 00:31:50.571
mechanisms for maintaining this
state of homeostasis,

00:31:50.571 --> 00:31:53.039
that is, things staying the
same;

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:56.289
the body stays the same,
homeostasis.

00:31:56.289 --> 00:32:00.323
This, in spite of the fact that
we take a variety of chemicals

00:32:00.323 --> 00:32:04.158
into our bodies in different
ways and we have to do that to

00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:07.981
stay alive,
but we have mechanisms to

00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:13.389
control this very well.
So homeostasis is enabled by

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:17.905
sometimes complex,
sometimes very simple control

00:32:17.905 --> 00:32:20.882
mechanisms.
These are mechanisms that

00:32:20.882 --> 00:32:24.033
can be described not too
differently from mechanisms that

00:32:24.033 --> 00:32:26.960
you're familiar with for
maintaining homeostasis.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.783
For example,
the thermostat in your dorm

00:32:29.783 --> 00:32:31.387
room.
Maybe you don't control

00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:34.250
thermostats in your dorm room,
some of you do and some of you

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.752
don't probably,
and maybe it doesn't work very

00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:40.038
well so it might not be a good
example, but imagine a perfect

00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:42.941
thermostat that you set for a
temperature and then the

00:32:42.941 --> 00:32:46.008
temperature stays the same
inside the room no matter what

00:32:46.008 --> 00:32:49.150
the temperature is outside.
Well how does that work?

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:53.670
It works by a control mechanism
called negative feedback,

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:58.755
and the thermostat is measuring
the temperature and then sending

00:32:58.755 --> 00:33:03.567
a signal to a heater somewhere.
If the temperature drops below

00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:07.210
a certain level it sends a
signal, 'turn on the heat',

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:12.967
and that signal stays on until
it gets a negative signal to

00:33:12.967 --> 00:33:15.275
turn off.
When does that negative signal

00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:17.336
happen?
When the temperature gets above

00:33:17.336 --> 00:33:21.447
the level you want it to be.
So that's a negative feedback

00:33:21.447 --> 00:33:23.906
control system.
The heater is on,

00:33:23.906 --> 00:33:27.550
it's producing heat until a
negative signal is registered,

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.809
'oh we've gone too high',
and then it turns off.

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:34.946
Our bodies have mechanisms
like that, that mainly use the

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:38.600
principle of negative feedback
in order to control the

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.150
parameters that are important
for life within a certain range.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.405
So why is temperature,
for example,

00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:47.859
such an important thing to
control?

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:52.302
Why are all of us in this room
within plus or minus a few

00:33:52.302 --> 00:33:57.440
tenths of a degrees at 37°
Centigrade, or 98.6°

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.170
Fahrenheit, why is that such an
important thing?

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.390
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.740
Mark Saltzman:
Because that's the

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.921
temperature at which many of the
molecules in our bodies operate

00:34:11.921 --> 00:34:14.703
at their most efficient,
and enzymes is the best example

00:34:14.703 --> 00:34:16.444
of that.
Enzymes work best,

00:34:16.444 --> 00:34:20.284
enzymes are proteins that
catalyze chemical reactions and

00:34:20.284 --> 00:34:24.809
our bodies operate by elaborate
networks of chemical reactions,

00:34:24.809 --> 00:34:28.510
and our enzymes are optimized
to work at 37°.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.711
When we're off from that
temperature then they don't work

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:34.601
properly.
And there are other examples as

00:34:34.601 --> 00:34:37.300
well, but that's why it's
important.

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:45.517
So we're going to think
about - in the next few weeks -

00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:49.407
we're going to think about the
human organism at different

00:34:49.407 --> 00:34:53.570
levels of magnification and I've
shown those levels here.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.865
The whole human organism is
made up of a collection of

00:34:56.865 --> 00:34:59.539
organs, and organ systems,
you know this.

00:34:59.539 --> 00:35:02.336
The cardiovascular system,
which is the heart and the

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:05.240
blood vessels which are
responsible for - and the blood

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.575
and so this is responsible for
moving blood around the body and

00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:11.640
the blood brings oxygen and
nutrients to every part of the

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.750
body,
you know that.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.021
Organs, organ systems like
the cardiovascular system are

00:35:17.021 --> 00:35:20.293
made up of tissues and tissues
are collections of cells that

00:35:20.293 --> 00:35:22.900
are working in synchrony for
some function.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.300
The heart, for example,
has a muscular tissue.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.894
It has a very well-developed
muscular tissue and its function

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.710
is to contract and relax,
contract and relax.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.496
As it does that it changes the
volume of the heart and gives

00:35:36.496 --> 00:35:40.540
the - creates the pressure that
moves blood around your body,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.338
so it has that muscular system.
It also has a blood vessel

00:35:45.338 --> 00:35:48.106
system in it.
The muscles of the heart have

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:52.320
to give blood themselves so they
have blood vessels inside.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.414
Your stomach is a very complex
organ that has a muscle layer,

00:35:56.414 --> 00:36:00.371
it has an epithelial layer
which is the interface with food

00:36:00.371 --> 00:36:03.792
that comes in,
and it also has a nervous

00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:07.813
system, so does the heart.
So organs are made up of

00:36:07.813 --> 00:36:11.945
combinations of tissues where
all the tissues are collections

00:36:11.945 --> 00:36:14.769
of cells that are doing some
function,

00:36:14.769 --> 00:36:18.020
nervous tissue,
muscular tissue,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.948
epithelial tissue,
those are examples of tissues

00:36:22.948 --> 00:36:26.717
that form organs.
Here I just show tissues at

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:29.649
two levels of magnification and
when we think about tissues

00:36:29.649 --> 00:36:32.278
we're going to be interested in
a couple of different

00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:34.644
characteristics.
One, at the first level,

00:36:34.644 --> 00:36:37.090
what are the cells that make up
that tissue?

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.167
Because the cells are the
fundamental component of our

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:44.008
bodies;
very interesting because all of

00:36:44.008 --> 00:36:48.096
our cells in our body share many
characteristics and some of

00:36:48.096 --> 00:36:51.630
those characteristics are shown
on this picture.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.609
They have a nucleus,
they have a cell membrane,

00:36:54.609 --> 00:36:58.690
they have organelles throughout
them, they have the same DNA.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.670
All of your cells have the same
DNA, so the same genetic

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.000
information, and yet cells in
your brain,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.998
and cells in your heart,
and cells in your kidney do

00:37:06.998 --> 00:37:09.690
very different things.
So how can cells,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:13.457
which have the same sort of
master information DNA,

00:37:13.457 --> 00:37:15.642
in your brain,
and your heart,

00:37:15.642 --> 00:37:18.429
and your kidney be so
different?

00:37:18.429 --> 00:37:22.595
That's a question and it's one
that we'll talk about in weeks

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:24.391
to come.
How do those differences

00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:27.099
between cells contribute to the
properties of the tissues,

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:30.066
which contribute to the
properties of the organs,

00:37:30.066 --> 00:37:33.404
which contribute to the
properties of a person and this

00:37:33.404 --> 00:37:37.188
maintenance of homeostasis?
The main function of all your

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:40.601
cells, and all your tissues,
and all your organs is to

00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:44.818
maintain this homeostasis,
which allows you to live in a

00:37:44.818 --> 00:37:48.623
changing environment.
We're going to spend the

00:37:48.623 --> 00:37:52.669
first few weeks of the course
talking about first DNA and

00:37:52.669 --> 00:37:54.739
genes.
We'll talk about how they work

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:57.625
and we'll go over that quickly
because I know most of you know

00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:00.369
something about how DNA - what
DNA is and how it works.

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:03.559
Then we'll talk about
engineering of DNA and why this

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:06.933
has been such - not only a
rapidly growing and advancing

00:38:06.933 --> 00:38:10.860
area but one that's so important
for Biomedical Engineering.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.761
We'll talk about cells and how
they work, how cells in

00:38:13.761 --> 00:38:16.170
different parts of the body are
different,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.044
why, and how they contribute to
tissues at a very sort of simple

00:38:20.044 --> 00:38:23.918
level so that you can understand
this as we start thinking about

00:38:23.918 --> 00:38:26.440
using cells for engineering
purposes.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.948
I want to just highlight
what's in Chapter 2,

00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:31.926
because I told you we're not
going to cover the details in

00:38:31.926 --> 00:38:34.867
Chapter 2 in the course,
but I give it to you as a

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:38.590
resource so that you - you might
have other books which describe

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.700
this which you like,
and you've read already and so

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.259
- but I'm going to assume that
you understand this information

00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:47.367
to some extent.
And again if you don't,

00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:50.080
and you feel like you'd like a
review session on this please

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.380
send me an email and I'll set
one up next week.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.110
I do want to talk about one
important subject which you

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.840
might not have thought too much
about and that's lipids,

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.918
because lipids are so important
to the structure of the body

00:39:02.918 --> 00:39:05.683
because they make up the
membranes that form the cells

00:39:05.683 --> 00:39:09.014
that are the fundamental units.
Lipids are really complex

00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:12.626
molecules on their own right,
but because of their particular

00:39:12.626 --> 00:39:16.298
kind of complexity they allow
certain biological structures to

00:39:16.298 --> 00:39:18.275
form.
So most of the lipids,

00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:22.089
which make up cell membranes in
your body are of this category

00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:24.826
of phospholipids.
They're derived from a

00:39:24.826 --> 00:39:27.056
precursor called
triacylglyceride,

00:39:27.056 --> 00:39:30.908
which is as glycerol molecule
with three fatty acid chains

00:39:30.908 --> 00:39:34.042
dangling off of it.
Fatty acid chains are fat

00:39:34.042 --> 00:39:37.129
molecules, they behave,
if you have a lot of them in

00:39:37.129 --> 00:39:39.985
solution like oil.
That's what triglycerides are

00:39:39.985 --> 00:39:43.679
like, they're just like oil.
So if you had a jar full of

00:39:43.679 --> 00:39:47.976
triglycerides it would behave
like an oil, many would be

00:39:47.976 --> 00:39:52.343
liquid at room temperature.
What happens if you add them to

00:39:52.343 --> 00:39:55.400
water?
You get salad dressing, right?

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.547
You get glob- if you mix it you
get globlets of oil,

00:39:58.547 --> 00:40:02.188
or globlets of triglycerides,
they're floating around in the

00:40:02.188 --> 00:40:05.563
fluid if you mix it.
If you let it sit they settle

00:40:05.563 --> 00:40:08.827
out into two phases again,
that's how triglycerides

00:40:08.827 --> 00:40:11.247
behave.
Now if you've gone to the

00:40:11.247 --> 00:40:14.783
doctor, often they'll measure
your triaglyceride level as a

00:40:14.783 --> 00:40:18.197
measure of how healthy your
liver is and how healthy your

00:40:18.197 --> 00:40:20.681
diet is.
Having too much triaglyceride

00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:23.306
or fat in your blood,
the wrong kind of fat in

00:40:23.306 --> 00:40:25.989
particular, is not considered a
good thing.

00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:29.080
You need some of it because
some of it gets converted into

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.900
molecules called phospholipids,
and phospholipids are

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.312
different.
They have two fatty acid chains

00:40:34.312 --> 00:40:37.084
and so these are the oily like
parts of the molecule,

00:40:37.084 --> 00:40:39.110
the molecules that behave like
oil.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.643
And then linked to the glycerol
instead of a third fatty acid

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:45.530
chain is a water soluble
molecule, like a salt.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.590
Often it's a salt called
phosphocholine and so you get a

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:56.019
phospholipid that's made of
choline and two lipid chains.

00:40:56.019 --> 00:40:59.002
Now this behaves very
differently in water because

00:40:59.002 --> 00:41:01.364
part of it is water soluble,
this part is,

00:41:01.364 --> 00:41:04.635
it's a molecule that would like
to dissolve in water and part of

00:41:04.635 --> 00:41:06.883
it is like oil,
it doesn't want to dissolve in

00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:08.522
water.
So what happens when you put

00:41:08.522 --> 00:41:11.372
these molecules in water?
Well instead of forming

00:41:11.372 --> 00:41:15.369
droplets like fat they arrange
in a very particular way,

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:19.335
they form these structures that
are called self-assembled

00:41:19.335 --> 00:41:22.309
structures because they occur
naturally,

00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:24.760
because of properties of the
lipids.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:30.076
The lipids will form a bi-layer
where the water soluble part of

00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:35.049
the lipid points out of this
layer and the oily part points

00:41:35.049 --> 00:41:37.538
in.
The fascinating part about this

00:41:37.538 --> 00:41:41.073
layer is that it solves the
problem for phospholipids about

00:41:41.073 --> 00:41:44.789
how to exist in water when half
of you wants to be in oil,

00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:49.231
and that the water soluble part
of the top leaflet here,

00:41:49.231 --> 00:41:52.300
of the top points up into the
water,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.570
and the fatty acid chains point
down.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.885
The opposite leaflet does the
other thing, the water soluble

00:41:58.885 --> 00:42:01.190
part points down and the fat
points up,

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:07.086
so now you have thin region of
fat which is surrounded on both

00:42:07.086 --> 00:42:10.248
sides by water.
This is a really

00:42:10.248 --> 00:42:14.652
interesting system because it
also solves a problem for the

00:42:14.652 --> 00:42:17.155
cell.
The problem it solves for the

00:42:17.155 --> 00:42:20.880
cell is how to do I make a
barrier around myself to define

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.997
what's in me and what's outside
of me when most of what's around

00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:28.688
me and what's in me is water.
So inside the cell mostly

00:42:28.688 --> 00:42:32.330
water, outside the cell mostly
water, but I need to separate my

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.038
water from the water outside.
We'll see why they have to

00:42:36.038 --> 00:42:39.978
separate that in a minute,
but they do that - these lipid

00:42:39.978 --> 00:42:44.409
bi-layers solve that problem for
them and they're self-assembled

00:42:44.409 --> 00:42:48.489
structures from these molecules
called phospholipids.

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:51.013
Now that's not the only
thing in cell membranes,

00:42:51.013 --> 00:42:53.190
there are also proteins in cell
membranes,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.565
and these proteins are special
proteins that can exist within

00:42:57.565 --> 00:43:00.723
membranes like this,
and they exist because these

00:43:00.723 --> 00:43:03.553
proteins also have different
segments with different

00:43:03.553 --> 00:43:05.680
properties.
Some of the segments dissolve

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.288
in water, the gray segments
here, and the lightly colored

00:43:08.288 --> 00:43:10.989
segments don't dissolve in
water, they dissolve in fat.

00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:14.718
So they like to be in the
membrane and they're stable

00:43:14.718 --> 00:43:18.949
there and they won't come out
because their structure allows

00:43:18.949 --> 00:43:21.889
them to exist in these unique
spaces.

00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:25.665
I'm going to stop there and
we'll pick up on this topic,

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:28.224
not next week,
but the week after when we

00:43:28.224 --> 00:43:30.719
start talking about cell
structure.

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:34.656
I wanted to introduce it to you
so that if you don't - haven't

00:43:34.656 --> 00:43:38.399
heard about this before you
might want to read a little bit

00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:41.110
about this before we get to
Chapter 5.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.756
Next week we're going to talk
about genes and genetic

00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:46.822
engineering, that's Chapter 3.

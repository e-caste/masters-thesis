00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.924
Prof: Okay,
so let's pickup where we left

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:08.915
off on Monday,
and we were starting to talk in

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:12.510
more detail about MacIntyre's
argument.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.017
And one of the things I want to
zero in centrally on today is

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:23.800
his account of human psychology,
or what used to be called human

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.810
nature.
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.498
And that differs importantly
from every account of human

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:34.870
psychology we've looked at thus
far for a number of reasons,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.533
and I'm going to spell them out
in a little bit more detail than

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.050
we talked about on Monday.
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.277
Basically it is an Aristotelian
conception of the structure of

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:51.791
human psychology,
and that has a number of

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.420
features to it.
 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.431
One is that I mentioned to you,
that we think of human beings

00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:00.770
as teleological creatures.
 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.369
We are purposive creatures.
 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.578
We always want to know what the
point of an activity is.

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:13.242
Now if you go back to
Aristotle, Aristotle held the

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:19.022
view that while we are purposive
creatures we only reason about

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:24.580
the means to achieve our goals,
not the goals themselves.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.405
For Aristotle,
Aristotle's conception of

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:29.702
virtue,
the virtues,

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.000
the virtues were given for all
time,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.583
and he had his list of the
virtues which you can find if

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:36.696
you go back and read the
Nicomachean

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.730
Ethics.
 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.322
They're things like,
courage, honesty,

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:44.916
and various others,
perhaps debatable,

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:46.470
perhaps not.
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.541
But in any event in Aristotle's
scheme of things,

00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:55.290
what we reason about is the
means to achieve the virtues,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920
not the virtues themselves.
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.549
And I'm going to come back to
that because one of the respects

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.105
in which MacIntyre differs from
Aristotle is that he wants to

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:11.320
say the virtues--
he wants to at least go this

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.878
far with the Enlightenment
thinkers,

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:20.639
he wants to say that what
counts as a virtue is,

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:25.530
to some extent, up for debate.
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.834
Just to what extent and how we
debate it are things that I'll

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:30.908
come back to.
 

00:02:30.908 --> 00:02:35.635
But the more important point is
that this as an account of the

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:40.750
structure of human psychology we
need to know what the point is.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.190
We have goals.
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.860
We have purposes.
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.400
When those purposes are met
we're happy and fulfilled.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.208
When they're not met we're
frustrated and unsatisfied and

00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:59.300
discontented.
 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.407
Just to give you a somewhat
different perspective on this

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:08.028
approach to thinking about human
psychology I would say that the

00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:11.550
other influential Aristotelian
of our time,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.887
besides Alasdair MacIntyre,
is the Nobel Prize winning

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:22.024
economist Amartya Sen who
develops the idea of human

00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:25.650
potentiality as the core notion.
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.818
That we're people who have
potential,

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:33.270
and unless we realize our
potential we're going to be in

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.192
some basic sense incomplete,
not fulfilled not happy human

00:03:40.192 --> 00:03:41.410
beings.
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.068
And so in Sen's account of
justice,

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:49.477
which I wish we had time to
talk about in this course but we

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:51.901
don't,
it's analogous that he's an

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.919
economist,
not a philosopher,

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.641
so he brings the considerations
of an economist to this

00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.470
question.
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.967
But it's the same question of
human beings who have a certain

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:09.834
kind of potential that has to be
realized in order for them to be

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:14.050
fulfilled in their teleological
capacity,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.370
that has to occur.
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.641
And so with MacIntyre,
too, it's this idea of the

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.000
structure of human psychology
being goal-directed,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.649
and we'll get into the content
later.

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:36.673
But so that's the first thing,
and then the second was that

00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:41.759
our behavior is,
in a very fundamental way,

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.060
other-directed.
 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.413
So just, again,
by way of comparison think back

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:53.523
to the assumptions about
other-directedness in previous

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:58.350
thinkers who we have considered
in this course.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.079
When we focused on the
utilitarian tradition we saw

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.959
people as essentially
self-referential.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.887
Remember Ronald Reagan's famous
question in 1984,

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:13.670
"Are you better off than
you were four years ago?"

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.259
was a self-referential question.
 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.600
"Are you better off than
you were four years ago?"

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.540
All you have to look at is how
you were faring four years ago

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.480
and how you're faring now,
and ask yourself that question.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.949
Other people don't enter into
it at all.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.382
Then when we considered Marxism
we came to think about

00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:40.233
other-directed conceptions of
human psychology in that Marx

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:45.170
made our welfare critically
reliant on what others get.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.161
And so he said that your
perception of whether you're

00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:58.480
exploited turns upon what your
employer gets.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.483
Remember we talked about this
in some depth and concluded that

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:08.242
Marx was half-right in that
people are often other-directed

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:13.165
in that their sense of whether
what they get is legitimate is

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:18.345
dependent on what others get,
but what he was wrong about was

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:22.291
that people tend to compare
themselves to people who are

00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:25.810
similarly situated in the
socioeconomic order.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.076
So autoworkers compare
themselves maybe to steel

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:35.069
workers, but not to auto
executives, and they don't make

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.519
those kinds of global
comparisons.

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:43.079
Nonetheless there is something
to this idea that people's

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:48.209
conception of their welfare is
connected to what others get,

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:53.021
and so relative inequalities
matter simply from the

00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:58.220
perspective of your feeling of
how well-off you are.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.858
And you can tell yourself any
number of stories to make this

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:05.759
point.
 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.553
The telling one,
quite often,

00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:11.206
I think is you give a child a
glass of orange juice that's

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:15.300
half full and he's very happy,
and then you give his sister

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.264
one that's completely full and
he immediately becomes unhappy

00:07:19.264 --> 00:07:23.297
because what matters to him is
the relative difference and not

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:25.278
what he has in his glass.
 

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.319
So that's a notion of
other-directed.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.319
And of course you can take this
notion of other-directed

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.391
further,
still, by linking your utility

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:40.319
not just to what other people
get,

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.420
but to actually what other
people experience.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.177
And this is the concept of
interdependent utility,

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:56.230
as it gets referred to in the
literature.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:02.088
And the examples here are
things like a parent taking

00:08:02.088 --> 00:08:07.947
pleasure in their child's
success and feeling pain at

00:08:07.947 --> 00:08:11.778
their child's lack of success.
 

00:08:11.778 --> 00:08:16.596
One of the famous one-liners
that parents will resonate with

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:20.923
is, "You can only be as
happy as your least happy

00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:22.230
child."
 

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.199
So if your kids are unhappy
then you are miserable.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:27.930
That's the notion of
interdependent utility.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.910
Your happiness is conditioned
on what others get,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:37.000
but not just in making us a
relative judgment with the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.932
orange juice kind of a case,
but your happiness becomes

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:46.289
dependent on what people
actually themselves experience,

00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:49.038
hence interdependent utility.
 

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:53.440
The example of the child's
happiness making the parent--

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.826
or the child's success making
the parent happy is an

00:08:56.826 --> 00:09:01.618
interdependent positive utility,
but of course there are

00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:06.982
interdependent negative
utilities as well as when a

00:09:06.982 --> 00:09:13.528
sadist's or a rapist's utility
goes up as a byproduct of their

00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:17.070
victim's utility going down.
 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.653
Again, that interdependent
negative utility,

00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:23.440
and it's the mirror image of
interdependent positive utility.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.783
The Aristotelian conception
that MacIntyre embraces takes

00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:34.320
interdependent utilities a step
further even than that,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.798
though, in that it's not just
that your happiness,

00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:44.106
or satisfaction,
or fulfillment is conditioned

00:09:44.106 --> 00:09:50.269
upon the experience of others,
but it's the experience of

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.798
others as it relates to you.
 

00:09:52.798 --> 00:09:57.200
It's the others' experience of
you, if you like.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.306
And so a good example of this
actually comes from Hegel's

00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:07.321
Phenomenology where he
talks about this dialectic

00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:13.340
between the master and the slave
as being inherently unstable.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.166
But it's not just unstable
because the slave is going to

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:20.360
find it unsatisfactory.
 

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.351
It's unstable because the
master will find it

00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.278
unsatisfactory.
 

00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:30.490
Hegel says, in The
Phenomenology,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.974
that what we want most
fundamentally is recognition

00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:38.619
from others,
but it can't be recognition

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:41.600
from others that we don't
respect.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.287
So recognition of a slave
saying, "Yes,

00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:44.850
master.
 

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.480
No, master,"
is not going to be satisfactory

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.220
or fulfilling to you.
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.980
What you want is recognition
from an equal or perhaps a

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.652
superior, but you want
recognition from somebody whose

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:03.090
recognition can be valuable to
you.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.970
It's a source of feeling valued
by somebody you value.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.572
So it takes this idea,
as I said, of interdependent

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:17.452
utility even a step further
because it now goes to the

00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:23.158
reciprocal relationship between
you and the other person,

00:11:23.158 --> 00:11:28.120
and that is the idea of
practices.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.735
It's this sort of neo-Hegelian
idea in this particular sense

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:36.490
that informs MacIntyre's notion
of a practice.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.100
When I gave you the example on
Monday I said,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.298
"If I build sheds and
write books,

00:11:43.298 --> 00:11:48.870
it's not enough for me to have
the carpenters say,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.019
'Oh, you wrote a good book,'
and the academics say,

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.418
'That's a nice shed.'
 

00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:56.529
I want the carpenter to say
that's a good shed,

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:59.668
and the people who know about
writing books to say,

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:03.636
'This is a good book.'"
That's the notion of he's a

00:12:03.636 --> 00:12:05.080
pitchers' pitcher.
 

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.639
You want recognition from
people for whom you have esteem

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.320
at the relevant activity.
 

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.817
So this is a different,
again, view of the structure of

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:19.399
human psychology.
 

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:24.316
All of these different theories
are predicated on some account

00:12:24.316 --> 00:12:27.460
of the structure of human
psychology.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.582
And indeed, I think that one
thing you should be seeing as we

00:12:32.582 --> 00:12:37.450
move through and examine these
different arguments is that

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.830
every political theory has an
account of human psychology,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.158
and an account of how the world
operates causally.

00:12:46.158 --> 00:12:50.330
And you need to sometimes dig
to get them out,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.388
but one of the ways in which
you should evaluate them is you

00:12:54.388 --> 00:12:57.956
should ask yourself,
"What is the theory of

00:12:57.956 --> 00:13:00.240
human psychology driving this?
 

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.360
Does it make sense?
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.072
Is it true to my own experience
or not, and if not why

00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:07.139
not?"
 

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:09.517
That's one question,
and then the second is,

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:12.558
"What are the assumptions
about how the world works

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:13.610
causally?"
 

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.230
and I'll come back to those in
relation to MacIntyre again.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.099
But you could go through all
the thinkers we've considered

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:24.424
and find assumptions and
arguments about those two

00:13:24.424 --> 00:13:27.006
things,
and they provide a very good

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:30.984
comparative reference point for
thinking about how they stack up

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:34.393
against one another as we've
just seen as went from the

00:13:34.393 --> 00:13:37.269
utilitarian,
to the Marxian,

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:43.883
to the different variance of
other-referential assumptions

00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:46.899
about human psychology.
 

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:51.652
So this is the MacIntyre
approach that what we really

00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:56.769
want out of life is esteem from
people who we esteem,

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:03.668
and that operates through these
practices as he describes them.

00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:10.169
And this is just a summary
statement of what I've already

00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:16.206
told you, where he says,
virtues as he describes them

00:14:16.206 --> 00:14:19.690
are embedded in practices.
 

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.643
"It belongs to the concept
of a practice as I have outlined

00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:26.076
it--
and as we're all familiar with

00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:29.344
it in our actual lives,
whether we are painters or

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:32.631
physicists or quarterbacks or
indeed just lovers of good

00:14:32.631 --> 00:14:36.244
painting,
or first rate experiments or a

00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:39.629
well-thrown pass--
that its goods can only be

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:43.118
achieved by subordinating
ourselves within the practice in

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.808
our relationships to other
practitioners.

00:14:45.808 --> 00:14:49.940
We have to learn to recognize
what is due to whom;

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.047
we have to be prepared to take
whatever self-endangering risks

00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:58.527
are demanded along the way;
and we have to listen carefully

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:03.254
to what we are told about our
own inadequacies and to reply

00:15:03.254 --> 00:15:07.250
with the same carefulness for
the facts."

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.879
So this is the notion that I
translated into the proposition

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:16.428
that when you walk into your
first Yale College course,

00:15:16.428 --> 00:15:18.870
you don't look around and say
to the people next to you,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.669
"How should we run this
course?

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:22.889
What should we agree too?"
 

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:27.590
On the contrary what you do is
say, "What is the practice?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.447
What are the norms?
 

00:15:28.447 --> 00:15:29.350
What are the rules?
 

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.759
How do I do well here?
 

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:33.298
What's expected of me?
 

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:35.298
How will know if I'm doing
well?"

00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:38.437
It might occur to you much
later on to say,

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.649
"That wasn't a very
well-run course.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.274
It could have been run better
if this, that and the

00:15:44.274 --> 00:15:45.009
other."
 

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:49.475
So you can criticize,
and I'll come back to that

00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:53.605
point later,
but you can only criticize on

00:15:53.605 --> 00:15:58.926
the basis of first having
internalized the norms governing

00:15:58.926 --> 00:16:00.418
the practice.
 

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:04.975
You don't criticize somebody's
pitching style in major league

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:09.000
baseball until you've learned a
lot about pitching.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.091
Or maybe you do.
 

00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:13.778
You sit there and throw your
beer can at the screen,

00:16:13.778 --> 00:16:17.558
"Err, he's terrible,"
but it's not the form of

00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:20.240
criticism he is going to care
about,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.557
and that's the point,
and it's not likely to be the

00:16:24.557 --> 00:16:27.840
criticism that makes any
difference.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.948
So rather than the voluntary
agent being at the center of

00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:38.083
things,
which is the workmanship story,

00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:43.879
this anti-Enlightenment story
subordinates the individual to

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:46.493
the practice,
to the group,

00:16:46.493 --> 00:16:49.759
to the inherited system of
norms and values.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.100
And if you want a contemporary
reference point just,

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.889
again, to sharpen the
comparison here,

00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:02.736
compare the Cartesian idea
which puts the willing agent at

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:06.650
the center of the universe with
the Ubuntu,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.622
which is a kind of African
religion which does the

00:17:11.622 --> 00:17:13.548
contrarian thing.
 

00:17:13.548 --> 00:17:16.028
Instead of, "I think
therefore I am,"

00:17:16.028 --> 00:17:19.372
it's "I am because we are,
and since we are,

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.328
therefore I am."
 

00:17:21.328 --> 00:17:25.291
So it's this idea of
subordinating yourself to an

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:29.913
inherited system of norms and
practices in which you find

00:17:29.913 --> 00:17:33.086
yourself,
not which you created or

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:36.108
hypothetically might have
created,

00:17:36.108 --> 00:17:38.140
but rather in which you find
yourself.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:45.150
So this is a fundamental
difference.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:50.058
It doesn't get more fundamental
than this,

00:17:50.058 --> 00:17:52.586
I think, because as you've seen
in every variant of

00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:56.673
Enlightenment thinking,
it's the willing creative agent

00:17:56.673 --> 00:18:00.700
that is at the ultimate bottom
of the heap,

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.558
and here it's not.
 

00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:09.058
It's the subordinated
individual, and the community,

00:18:09.058 --> 00:18:12.848
or the practice,
or the tradition to which the

00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:18.240
person is subordinated that is
at the very bottom of the heap.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.680
So this is really a fundamental
difference.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.300
So, features of Aristotelian,
or we might call it

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.150
neo-Aristotelian psychology;
one is we're teleological in

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.250
the sense of being purposive.
 

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.345
We have potential to realize
and realizing that potential is

00:18:41.345 --> 00:18:43.848
essential to our happiness.
 

00:18:43.848 --> 00:18:47.078
It's not just getting more of
what gives you utility.

00:18:47.078 --> 00:18:50.068
There's some developmental
dimension to this.

00:18:50.068 --> 00:18:55.904
Second, the individual is
subordinated to a practice,

00:18:55.904 --> 00:19:02.525
and that translates into this
idea of the community becoming

00:19:02.525 --> 00:19:06.788
before the individual in
politics.

00:19:06.788 --> 00:19:13.470
But third, and in some ways for
MacIntyre's story most important

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:19.196
of all, is that on the
Aristotelian scheme human nature

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:21.000
is malleable.
 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.759
It's plastic.
 

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:26.588
It can be shaped in different
ways.

00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:33.115
And what is so deeply misguided
about the Enlightenment project

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:39.640
from MacIntyre's point of view
is that it does not take account

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.430
of this fact.
 

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.856
It does not take account of the
fact that human beings are

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:46.180
malleable creatures.
 

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.640
Human psychology is shaped by
circumstances.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.595
And so when Rousseau says at
the start of The Social

00:19:58.595 --> 00:20:03.104
Contract,
"I'm going to reason about

00:20:03.104 --> 00:20:08.681
politics taking men as they are
and laws as they might be,"

00:20:08.681 --> 00:20:13.373
that underscores the fact that
Rousseau is missing the

00:20:13.373 --> 00:20:18.772
developmental features of human
psychology and reasoning about

00:20:18.772 --> 00:20:20.190
politics.
 

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.184
And it's in missing that that
the Enlightenment project went

00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:26.538
off the rails.
 

00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:30.130
So let's talk about Aristotle's
scheme.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.192
Let me just read this to you
and then I will explain it if

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.190
you haven't understood it.
 

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:41.101
He says in his description,
"We thus have a threefold

00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:46.442
scheme in which human-nature-as-
it-happens-to-be (human nature

00:20:46.442 --> 00:20:51.182
in its untutored [or raw]
state) is initially discrepant

00:20:51.182 --> 00:20:56.093
and discordant with the precepts
of ethics and needs to be

00:20:56.093 --> 00:21:00.660
transformed by the instruction
of practical reason and

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.796
experience into human-nature-as-
it-could-be-if-i

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.640
t-realized-its-telos.
 

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.358
Each of the three elements of
the scheme--

00:21:10.358 --> 00:21:13.890
the conception of untutored
human nature,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.298
the conception of the precepts
of rational ethics,

00:21:17.298 --> 00:21:20.050
and the conception of
human-nature-as-

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.098
it-could-be-if-i
t-realized-its-telos--

00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:28.643
requires reference to the other
two if its status and function

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:31.460
are to be intelligible."
 

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:37.105
So his point here is,
if you go back and read

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:42.881
Aristotle, he had a view of raw,
or untutored,

00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:49.940
or brute human nature,
how we are when we are born.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.792
Then he had an account of human
beings as they could be if they

00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:59.224
realized their telos,
their purposes,

00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:03.885
and then he had an account of
the rules that get you from the

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.440
one to the other.
 

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.296
The rules, the norms that get
you from the one to the other,

00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:11.650
and those are the rules of
ethics.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.358
So what are the rules of ethics?
 

00:22:15.358 --> 00:22:19.853
The rules of ethics are those
things that get you from

00:22:19.853 --> 00:22:25.194
untutored or raw human nature to
the kinds of beings who realize

00:22:25.194 --> 00:22:27.568
their telos or purposes.
 

00:22:27.568 --> 00:22:29.673
And that's why,
if you look at ancient

00:22:29.673 --> 00:22:31.950
philosophers like Aristotle or
Plato,

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.523
the two central features of
their political theories that

00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:39.710
are completely absent when you
read,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.613
say John Rawls,
are a theory of family life and

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:45.650
a theory of education.
 

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:51.054
It would have been bizarre
beyond imagining for Aristotle

00:22:51.054 --> 00:22:57.230
or Plato to think you could have
a theory of politics that didn't

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.538
put a huge amount of attention
to those two things.

00:23:02.538 --> 00:23:05.453
Think of how many people in
this room have read Plato's

00:23:05.453 --> 00:23:08.099
Republic,
at least a good number of you.

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:10.759
That's a book about politics.
 

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:15.364
Think how much of that is about
how to rear children and the

00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:18.720
system of education that has to
prevail,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.328
an enormous amount of it,
probably half the book.

00:23:23.328 --> 00:23:27.373
There's nothing of that in
Rawls's Theory of

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:32.118
Justice, or Mill's account
in On Liberty.

00:23:32.118 --> 00:23:35.945
So it's a big difference,
and the reason is--and the same

00:23:35.945 --> 00:23:39.840
is true of Aristotle's ethics
and his other writings about

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.730
politics.
 

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.788
Lots of attention to education,
to the family,

00:23:44.788 --> 00:23:51.731
to these things that involve
shaping this malleable plastic

00:23:51.731 --> 00:23:58.913
human nature so that we have a
good outcome rather than a bad

00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:00.348
outcome.
 

00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:05.463
And so what bugs MacIntyre is,
he's saying,

00:24:05.463 --> 00:24:11.917
"We want to derive the
rules of ethics from human

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:16.180
nature as it is,
as we find it.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.858
 
 

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:26.472
But that's never going to work
because the rules of ethics are

00:24:26.472 --> 00:24:32.109
designed to improve behavior,
not to simply aggregate

00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:33.519
behavior.
 

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:39.496
And so anything we design
that's just derived from people

00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:45.471
as they happen to be is going to
seem unsatisfying to us,

00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:48.140
unsatisfactory to us.
 

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.227
So to go back to the examples,
we discussed affirmative

00:24:53.227 --> 00:24:55.058
action,
the ones he mentions at the

00:24:55.058 --> 00:24:58.391
beginning of the book,
abortion, affirmative action

00:24:58.391 --> 00:24:59.390
and so on.
 

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:04.136
Yes, we're going to see people
have different values and

00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:08.538
therefore different views about
those questions,

00:25:08.538 --> 00:25:12.861
but they're not going to
ultimately be satisfied with

00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:16.019
just recognizing their
differences,

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:21.520
because they have inherited a
whole language of talking about

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.288
ethics that presumes these
things can be resolved.

00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:32.914
There is more to ethical
disagreement than just accepting

00:25:32.914 --> 00:25:36.108
the differences among us.
 

00:25:36.108 --> 00:25:42.425
And that, at the end of the
day, is why the Enlightenment

00:25:42.425 --> 00:25:45.808
project was a fool's errand.
 

00:25:45.808 --> 00:25:50.117
This is just MacIntyre's more
eloquent and lucid statement of

00:25:50.117 --> 00:25:53.996
what I've been saying to you for
the last five minutes,

00:25:53.996 --> 00:25:55.720
that I'm capable of.
 

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.176
He says, "Since the moral
injunctions were originally at

00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:02.519
home in a scheme in which their
purpose was to correct,

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:06.670
improve and educate that human
nature,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.488
they are clearly not going to
be such as could be deduced from

00:26:10.488 --> 00:26:13.180
true statements about human
nature."

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.900
Just think of Bentham.
 

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.249
He says, "We are driven by
pleasure-seeking and

00:26:18.249 --> 00:26:19.298
pain-avoiding.
 

00:26:19.298 --> 00:26:22.720
I'm going to derive a whole
system from that."

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.003
MacIntyre is saying,
"That's crazy because

00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:32.126
these moral injunctions were
designed to be at odds with

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:34.269
human nature."
 

00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:37.721
"The injunctions of
morality, thus understood,

00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:41.243
are likely to be ones that
human nature...has strong

00:26:41.243 --> 00:26:43.038
tendencies to disobey.
 

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:47.444
Hence the eighteenth-century
moral philosophers engaged in

00:26:47.444 --> 00:26:51.000
what was an inevitably
unsuccessful project;

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.762
for they did indeed attempt to
find a rational basis for their

00:26:54.762 --> 00:26:58.650
moral beliefs in a particular
understanding of human nature,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.571
while inheriting a set of moral
injunctions on the one hand and

00:27:02.571 --> 00:27:05.420
a conception of human nature on
the other,

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.806
which had been expressly
designed to be discrepant with

00:27:09.806 --> 00:27:11.348
each other."
 

00:27:11.348 --> 00:27:16.548
"They inherited incoherent
fragments of a once coherent

00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:19.720
scheme of thought and action
and,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.740
since they did not recognize
their own peculiar historical

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.518
and cultural situation,
they could not recognize the

00:27:29.518 --> 00:27:33.162
impossible and quixotic
character of their

00:27:33.162 --> 00:27:35.740
self-appointed task."
 

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.950
 
 

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:43.928
Whether it's Bentham trying to
derive maxims of conduct from

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:48.568
the postulative pleasure-seeking
and pain-avoidance,

00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:54.111
or Rousseau trying to come up
with a system of government

00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:59.848
taking men as they are and their
laws as they might be,

00:27:59.848 --> 00:28:03.952
or Kant trying to see what
principles human beings as they

00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:08.559
currently are would affirm from
every conceivable standpoint,

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:12.318
it's never going to work.
 

00:28:12.318 --> 00:28:18.144
The morality that comes out of
this kind of reasoning is going

00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:23.108
to seem, and actually will be,
unsatisfying to us.

00:28:23.108 --> 00:28:28.034
And so if you now go back and
look at some of the puzzles and

00:28:28.034 --> 00:28:32.630
conundrums we came up with when
we were considering those

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.885
different theories,
MacIntyre would say,

00:28:35.885 --> 00:28:38.460
"Well, you shouldn't be
surprised.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:45.878
You shouldn't be surprised that
objective utilitarianism allows

00:28:45.878 --> 00:28:53.180
people to take advantage of one
another in appalling ways,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.557
and you shouldn't be surprised
that subject of utilitarianism

00:28:57.557 --> 00:29:01.715
allows people to ignore one
another in a morally appalling

00:29:01.715 --> 00:29:02.298
way.
 

00:29:02.298 --> 00:29:06.558
Because what makes things seem
morally appalling to you,

00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:12.019
treat people with dignity,
don't lie,

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:16.529
cheat and steal,
these are maxims that we know

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:20.240
people have a tendency to
disobey,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.558
and so that's the point of them.
 

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:30.567
They're to make us behave
better, and you're not going to

00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:35.308
be able to derive them in this
sense from a completely

00:29:35.308 --> 00:29:40.942
empirically accurate description
of human beings as we find them

00:29:40.942 --> 00:29:43.180
in the world."
 

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.450
So it's a kind of secular
doctrine of the fall.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:53.358
In Christian thinking we have
the fall,

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:56.848
and then we have inadequate
human beings,

00:29:56.848 --> 00:30:02.800
and the possibility of
redemption through internalizing

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.990
and accepting Christ as your
savior.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.930
This is a secular version of
the fall;

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:15.528
 
 

00:30:15.528 --> 00:30:18.460
the secular version of fallen
man, untutored,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:23.401
ill-formed human nature,
and then we have what we could

00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:28.503
be if we are properly formed,
and then the system of the

00:30:28.503 --> 00:30:33.436
rules of ethics that are going
to get us from the one to the

00:30:33.436 --> 00:30:34.190
other.
 

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:41.769
And it's the virtues within
practices that achieving them,

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:47.698
or achieving lives lived in
accordance with them that enable

00:30:47.698 --> 00:30:52.118
us to realize our purposes in a
good way,

00:30:52.118 --> 00:30:58.667
and it's the rules and norms
governing those practices that

00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:01.038
get us from A to B.
 

00:31:01.038 --> 00:31:05.326
And the big problem with the
Enlightenment philosophically is

00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:10.230
what I've just said to you,
that they try and engage in

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:15.798
this quixotic task,
but in politics itself it's the

00:31:15.798 --> 00:31:19.328
creation of an emotivist world.
 

00:31:19.328 --> 00:31:25.470
It's a creation of a world that
separates means from ends;

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:30.634
that values instrumental
reasoning, the business school

00:31:30.634 --> 00:31:32.259
world at large.
 

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:36.463
The world in which we make
ourselves agnostic about

00:31:36.463 --> 00:31:41.423
people's purposes and just try
to set ourselves up as a most

00:31:41.423 --> 00:31:44.618
efficient executor of any
purpose.

00:31:44.618 --> 00:31:47.970
"Have skills,
will travel."

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.759
"I'm a consultant."
 

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:51.969
"For what?"
 

00:31:51.969 --> 00:31:54.098
"Well, whatever you
need."

00:31:54.098 --> 00:31:58.134
That's what he finds
politically shocking and

00:31:58.134 --> 00:32:03.086
appalling, but he thinks it's
underpinned by this whole

00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:05.380
philosophical scheme.
 

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.883
Now, MacIntyre wrote this
during the--this book came out

00:32:09.883 --> 00:32:14.058
in 1984, which was at the height
of the Cold War.

00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:19.603
One of the points he was making
was everybody thinks that the

00:32:19.603 --> 00:32:25.423
great battle of our time is the
confrontation between capitalism

00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:30.932
and communism,
but for MacIntyre these are two

00:32:30.932 --> 00:32:38.439
sides of the same coin because
they are both ways in which this

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:45.219
Enlightenment project has been
played out in politics and

00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:50.640
they're both,
for him, appalling.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.817
I started out saying to you
MacIntyre thought of himself as

00:32:56.817 --> 00:33:02.259
a person on the political left,
at least when he was young when

00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:05.432
he wrote Marxism and
Christianity and Against

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:08.779
the Self-Images of the Age
and those early books,

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:11.130
but it's in a different sense.
 

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:16.884
It's not like Robert Bork said
at one point in his confirmation

00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:20.320
hearings,
you all are really too young to

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.682
remember this,
but they questioned him about

00:33:23.682 --> 00:33:28.160
his changing ideological beliefs
and at one point he said,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.978
"Well, I've always thought
if you're not a socialist before

00:33:31.978 --> 00:33:35.663
the age of 30 you have no heart,
and if you are a socialist

00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:38.309
after the age of 30 you have no
head."

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:40.838
This isn't MacIntyre.
 

00:33:40.838 --> 00:33:45.920
He wants to say the whole
Enlightenment venture,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.019
whether it's in its capitalist
or its socialist form is a

00:33:53.019 --> 00:34:00.997
variant of this deeply muddled,
hopeless quest to develop a

00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:08.739
science of politics based on
human nature as we find it.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:12.380
And so his prescriptions are
rather different.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.188
He says, "What matters at
this stage is the construction

00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:19.744
of local forms of community
within which civility and the

00:34:19.744 --> 00:34:23.492
intellectual and moral life can
be sustained through the new

00:34:23.492 --> 00:34:26.539
dark ages which are already upon
us."

00:34:26.539 --> 00:34:29.556
He's not a utopian;
he's a dystopian,

00:34:29.556 --> 00:34:30.309
almost.
 

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:33.693
"And if the tradition of
the virtues was able to survive

00:34:33.693 --> 00:34:35.780
the horrors of the last dark
ages,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.829
we are not entirely without
grounds for hope.

00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:41.539
This time however,
the barbarians are not waiting

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:44.143
beyond the frontiers;
they have already been

00:34:44.143 --> 00:34:46.159
governing us for quite some
time.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.422
And it is our lack of
consciousness of this that

00:34:49.422 --> 00:34:52.059
constitutes part of our
predicament.

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:57.023
We are waiting not for Godot,
but for another--doubtless very

00:34:57.023 --> 00:34:58.181
different--St.
 

00:34:58.181 --> 00:34:59.670
Benedict."
 

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:07.949
Now people criticized MacIntyre
for a variety of things,

00:35:07.949 --> 00:35:11.813
but one of the things they
criticized him for was that this

00:35:11.813 --> 00:35:15.610
seems to be sort of throwing up
your hands and saying,

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.050
"The whole world is
terrible.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.661
We're about to enter the new
dark ages, and there's not much

00:35:23.661 --> 00:35:27.030
we can do about it except hunker
down and hope."

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.248
And he wrote several books,
probably the most important of

00:35:31.248 --> 00:35:34.429
which is a book called,
Whose Justice?

00:35:34.429 --> 00:35:38.351
Which Rationality? in an
attempt to respond to these

00:35:38.351 --> 00:35:39.280
criticisms.
 

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.960
I'll talk about some of that in
a minute.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.576
On the actual politics that
flow from this,

00:35:49.576 --> 00:35:54.302
he never had anything more to
say than this,

00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:58.699
so it is a diagnosis without a
cure.

00:35:58.699 --> 00:36:03.289
I said this was written at the
height of the Cold War.

00:36:03.289 --> 00:36:06.157
If you look at the post-Cold
War and you say,

00:36:06.157 --> 00:36:09.090
"What would MacIntyre say
today?"

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:17.311
it's not at all clear because
he certainly would not be a fan

00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:20.190
of militant Islam,
 

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.530
 
 

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.070
but it's not clear what he
would, you know,

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:32.275
he would probably find the
spread of globalization as just

00:36:32.275 --> 00:36:37.206
one more step in this appalling
triumph of instrumental

00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:39.489
reasoning and values.
 

00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:45.840
So I think he would be no less
despondent,

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:51.429
and I think his diagnosis--this
is pure speculation,

00:36:51.429 --> 00:36:55.050
I haven't had this conversation
with him--

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.643
but my guess is that his
diagnosis of militant Islam and

00:36:57.643 --> 00:36:59.389
Jihadism and all of that would
be,

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.768
he would just say, "Well,
it's an inevitable undertow.

00:37:02.768 --> 00:37:11.635
It's an inevitable reaction by
the losers from globalization

00:37:11.635 --> 00:37:20.349
against the endless spread of
Enlightenment ideas."

00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:25.344
I think in some ways there
could be a more interesting

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:29.210
MacIntyrian analysis of China in
that,

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.737
in China, we see now the fusion
of communist politics and

00:37:33.737 --> 00:37:38.668
capitalist economics neither of
which shows any signs of going

00:37:38.668 --> 00:37:39.719
anywhere.
 

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:44.800
And so when in 1984 somebody
had said,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.280
"Well, capitalism and
communism are two sides of the

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.016
same coin,"
people would have been quite

00:37:51.016 --> 00:37:51.949
dismissive.
 

00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:56.297
When you think about China
today, it's quite thought

00:37:56.297 --> 00:37:57.320
provoking.
 

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.659
 
 

00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:05.929
So that's MacIntyre in a
nutshell.

00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:09.880
 
 

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.889
Lots of it's quite appealing.
 

00:38:12.889 --> 00:38:15.670
This account of human beings,
how many people--

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.380
never mind the unrealism of the
politics,

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.239
how many find this account of
human nature plausible,

00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:23.780
true to your own experience?
 

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.460
At least some. Not that many?
 

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.706
We do, you know we want--we've
sort of got lots of unrequited

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:33.320
love.
 

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.159
We want to be liked.
 

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:39.030
We want to be wanted,
and we want to be wanted by

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.500
cool people, or people we think
are cool.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:48.552
So that whole side of it seems
right, and the notion that

00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:54.389
political morality should
somehow be an improving thing

00:38:54.389 --> 00:38:56.119
seems right.
 

00:38:56.119 --> 00:39:01.579
That you can't just derive it
from the--

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:05.141
as Rousseau said it,
"If you take all of our

00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.954
individual preferences,
and add them up,

00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:11.271
and get rid of the pluses and
minuses that cancel one another

00:39:11.271 --> 00:39:13.760
out," that's maybe the
general will,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.413
but MacIntyre would say,
"It's going to be the

00:39:18.413 --> 00:39:21.018
lowest common denominator.
 

00:39:21.018 --> 00:39:24.000
It's going to cater to our base
instincts and we are malleable,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.422
shapeable, improvable creatures
and we're not happy unless

00:39:28.422 --> 00:39:31.059
that's actually happening."
 

00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:34.760
So all of that seems right,
but on the other hand,

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.657
as I mentioned to you,
MacIntyre makes one huge

00:39:39.657 --> 00:39:45.619
concession to the way of
thinking that at least motivated

00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:51.373
the Enlightenment,
which was that Aristotle was

00:39:51.373 --> 00:39:56.210
wrong to say we don't reason
about ends.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:03.092
Aristotle took ends as given
and said we only reason about

00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:04.059
means.
 

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:08.210
 
 

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:13.380
So the big challenge for
MacIntyre is to say,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:19.143
"Well, how do you say ends
can be put in question as

00:40:19.143 --> 00:40:24.396
subjects for debate,
but not then wind up with

00:40:24.396 --> 00:40:26.360
emotivism?"
 

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.739
How do you structure?
 

00:40:30.739 --> 00:40:32.389
How do you put limits,
if you like,

00:40:32.389 --> 00:40:35.809
on debates about ends which
recognizes that people do,

00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:41.920
in fact, you know--a difference
between human beings and dogs,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.141
let say, or lions is that dogs
and lions can't think critically

00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:49.079
about their own ends.
 

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:53.702
They just think instrumentally
about how--their ends really are

00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:54.300
given.
 

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.309
Dog wants to sit on a warm
couch.

00:40:56.309 --> 00:41:00.842
A lion wants to kill a buck,
and there's no question about

00:41:00.842 --> 00:41:02.989
that for a dog or a lion.
 

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:06.592
How you get on a warm couch
without being kicked off it by

00:41:06.592 --> 00:41:09.438
some nasty human,
that's a question for a dog,

00:41:09.438 --> 00:41:12.030
but not whether you want to be
on it.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.018
Human beings aren't like that.
 

00:41:14.018 --> 00:41:18.606
Human beings are capable of
thinking critically about

00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.460
purposes and goals.
 

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:26.626
What MacIntyre wants to say is
we have the structure of an

00:41:26.626 --> 00:41:31.170
Aristotelian psyche but not the
content.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:36.349
We are not, in the end,
dogs and lions in that sense.

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:39.500
We can critically appraise our
goals,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.152
but then we can argue about
them, and then we can disagree

00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:45.657
about them,
and we can even have civil wars

00:41:45.657 --> 00:41:47.889
about them when it really gets
down to it.

00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:51.518
So what do you do with the fact
that we reason about goals?

00:41:51.518 --> 00:41:58.030
That's why he introduces the
concept of a practice.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.998
He says, "Well,
it's true we reason about

00:41:59.998 --> 00:42:02.010
goals, but we don't pluck them
from nowhere.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:07.619
We're born into practices where
the goals are defined,

00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:11.726
where the goal of chess is to
get the person checkmate with as

00:42:11.726 --> 00:42:14.960
many of their pieces on the
board as possible.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.405
You don't say,
"Let's invent a board

00:42:17.405 --> 00:42:18.199
game."
 

00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:20.400
You say, "What are the
goals of chess?"

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.052
And so they're given by
practices or communities,

00:42:26.052 --> 00:42:33.000
and if we think about what is a
practice or a community over

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.179
time, it's a tradition.
 

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:41.324
And so what he wants to say is
we're born into practices and

00:42:41.324 --> 00:42:46.382
communities and we reproduce
them into the future simply by

00:42:46.382 --> 00:42:48.039
living in them.
 

00:42:48.039 --> 00:42:52.777
We inherit, we live,
and we reproduce into the

00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:55.851
future,
so it's a little reminiscent,

00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:59.753
or perhaps even more than a
little reminiscent of Burke's

00:42:59.753 --> 00:43:02.916
line about,
yes, we are part of a social

00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:05.811
contract,
but it's a contract among those

00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.974
who are dead,
those who are living,

00:43:07.974 --> 00:43:09.860
and those who are yet to be
born.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:15.300
And so, yes, we do question.
 

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.090
You might play chess for a time
and say,

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:21.869
"Well, should it really be
the goal of chess to beat the

00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:25.840
person with as many of their
pieces on the board as possible?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.318
Why?
 

00:43:26.318 --> 00:43:33.742
Maybe getting their subordinate
pieces on the way to before the

00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:39.130
checkmate should be a goal of
chess."

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.909
You could have a debate.
 

00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:45.199
Does it take more skill to
knock off the knights,

00:43:45.199 --> 00:43:47.802
and the bishops and so on in
order and then get the

00:43:47.802 --> 00:43:50.155
checkmate,
or does it take more skill to

00:43:50.155 --> 00:43:53.679
get the person checkmate with
their knights and bishops on the

00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:54.199
board.
 

00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:57.474
And that could be a debate you
could have, but it's a contained

00:43:57.474 --> 00:43:57.949
debate.
 

00:43:57.949 --> 00:44:00.018
It's a structured debate.
 

00:44:00.018 --> 00:44:05.639
And he wants to say our debates
about ends are always like that.

00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:08.659
 
 

00:44:08.659 --> 00:44:11.802
Think about debates,
getting closer to home for

00:44:11.802 --> 00:44:15.969
MacIntyre, think about debates
within with Catholic Church.

00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:19.610
The next generation of
Catholics doesn't say,

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.260
"Should we have a church?
 

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.289
Should it be organized?
 

00:44:23.289 --> 00:44:26.090
Should the bishop of Rome have
a special status?

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.710
Should there be papal
infallibility?"

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:33.115
No, you're born into a
structure that's already there,

00:44:33.115 --> 00:44:36.523
and then maybe you say,
"Well, why is there papal

00:44:36.523 --> 00:44:37.679
infallibility?
 

00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:41.000
It's only a relatively recent
creation.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.829
It doesn't make sense."
 

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:48.266
So your questioning of ends is
always from the vantage point of

00:44:48.266 --> 00:44:52.650
somebody who's born into an
inherited tradition.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.451
And it doesn't make sense to
criticize it from the

00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:57.110
perspective of outer space.
 

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:01.454
It doesn't make sense to any of
the participants,

00:45:01.454 --> 00:45:06.612
and it won't ultimately give
you any answers that'll be in

00:45:06.612 --> 00:45:09.510
any sense meaningful to you.
 

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:16.730
And so he sees traditions as
the mechanisms through which

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:21.630
practices are reproduced over
time,

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.041
and he wants to say,
yes, there is argument about

00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:28.923
ends within traditions,
but it's always this kind of

00:45:28.923 --> 00:45:32.775
structured argument that is
shaped by the way in which

00:45:32.775 --> 00:45:35.610
questions come up within
traditions.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.010
He says somewhere,
"Of course,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:43.655
part of what it means to be a
Jew is to argue about what it

00:45:43.655 --> 00:45:46.996
means to be a Jew,
that within the Jewish

00:45:46.996 --> 00:45:50.414
tradition that is one of the
things that people argue about

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:53.492
and disagree about,
but it's always going to be

00:45:53.492 --> 00:45:57.860
this bounded,
structured disagreement that

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:04.440
brings to bear other ideas
within the tradition on some

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.340
particular traditional claim.
 

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.621
For those of you who like
philosophical jargon Michael

00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:17.224
Walzer wrote a book along
comparable lines where he talked

00:46:17.224 --> 00:46:21.990
about the idea that the only
effective criticism is imminent

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.916
criticism which is a bit like--
imminent for Walzer,

00:46:26.916 --> 00:46:30.599
is a bit like internal for
MacIntyre.

00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:34.956
If you want to influence
Catholics to change their

00:46:34.956 --> 00:46:40.289
behavior you're not going to
influence them unless you appeal

00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:44.715
to values they embrace,
to norms they embrace,

00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:49.733
to elements of the tradition
they accept and show them how

00:46:49.733 --> 00:46:54.572
they are undermined by the
particular thing that you are

00:46:54.572 --> 00:46:56.070
criticizing.
 

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.639
So internal criticism,
imminent criticism,

00:46:59.639 --> 00:47:04.865
not ex cathedra criticism made
from outside a whole system of

00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:08.960
norms, and values,
practices, institutions.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.813
You might think you're right,
but it'll never have an effect

00:47:14.813 --> 00:47:19.079
on the people you're trying to
influence.

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:23.079
So MacIntyre's very much in
that spirit.

00:47:23.079 --> 00:47:28.855
We can argue and reason about
ends, but only from inside

00:47:28.855 --> 00:47:31.690
traditions and practices.
 

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:35.722
Okay, we're out of time,
and I will finish up with this

00:47:35.722 --> 00:47:39.530
and then start talking about
democracy on Monday.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:46.000

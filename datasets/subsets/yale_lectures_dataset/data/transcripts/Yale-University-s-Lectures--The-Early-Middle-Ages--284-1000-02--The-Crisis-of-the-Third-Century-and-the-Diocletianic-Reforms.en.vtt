00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:05.700
PAUL FREEDMAN: But the
advantage of talking to you,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.900
even on an inconvenient day,
is Diocletian.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.400
We don't use terms in the
professional world of history

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.500
like awesome very much.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.233
But the guy certainly
deserves that.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.433
He rescued the Roman Empire, and
we'll begin by saying what

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.967
he rescued it from.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:33.133
As a preliminary, the sections
are meeting this week.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:38.000
If you're wait-listed for
a section, just go to it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.200
We will have enough sections for
however many people take

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000
this course, right?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.967
So there are currently four.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:51.000
The additional ones that were
added since last week are

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.167
Wednesday at 2:30 and
Thursday at 7:00.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.167
And again, if you're
wait-listed, just go.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.400
We'll figure this out.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.567
There will be enough sections
for everybody.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:10.767
So I referred last time to
the third century crisis.

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:14.167
A crisis of the Roman Empire
that preceded the accession of

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:18.633
Diocletian, from 235 to 284.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:23.167
And we mentioned several
interrelated weaknesses of the

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.600
Empire that might be
seen as long-term

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.433
causes of this crisis.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.300
The size of the Empire.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.833
It's sheer, massive size.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.100
The problem the succession.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.867
That is, it was never quite
clear, and we'll talk about

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:52.267
this in more detail, how one
emperor succeeded another.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.667
The urban-rural imbalance.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:02.533
This was an empire
built on cities.

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.667
And to some extent, although
heavily debated among

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:09.433
historians to what extent, but
to some extent, the cities may

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:15.300
be said to have drained off the
energy, or been parasites

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.833
to the productivity of
the countryside.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.833
It was an empire that was,
according to one point of

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.433
view, more cosmopolitan than
it had been, according to

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.900
another point of view,
more barbarian.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.433
In other words, this was an
empire whose Roman population

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:40.500
was less dominant, partly
through its own success in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.567
co-opting other peoples.

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:47.367
Some of the peoples that it
co-opted we're not actually

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.433
originally inhabitants
of the Empire.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:52.933
Particularly, this is visible in
the armies, which tended to

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:59.033
be staffed by so-called
barbarian tribes.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:02.767
So called by the Romans,
who referred to them as

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:04.033
barbarians.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:10.467
Another problem is the East-West
imbalance, where the

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:13.900
East tends to do better
economically and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.700
demographically than the West,
demographically meaning

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.300
population.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.700
We live in a world where one
of the great threats is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.933
over-population.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:30.267
It is therefore not
self-evident, although true,

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:34.033
that for most of the time,
historically, most places have

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:36.900
trouble reproducing
their population.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.533
And indeed, we are starting to
enter into a period of great

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.033
demographic decline.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.967
The infant mortality, the low
life expectancy, the death of

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:57.800
women in childbirth, the
prevalence of disease, and to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.733
some extent, military threats
of invasion, or if not

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:06.533
threats, the reality, made it
hard for one generation to

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:09.100
produce children to
replace itself.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.767
And this is true up until
the dawn of modernity.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:17.500
So these are fundamental
problems of the Roman Empire.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.033
The real question is
why do they explode

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:24.367
in the third century?

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:28.233
And this is a question, as I
think I said last week, with

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:29.867
any great empire.

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:36.633
It's easy to point to the flaws
in a complicated system.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.100
Often size is one of them.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.167
Often bureaucracy.

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:44.033
Often overspending
on the military.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:48.600
But some of these go on for a
very long time, more or less

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.467
success of successfully,
despite the flaws.

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:56.067
And the Roman Empire went on
longer than most, as we said.

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:05.133
The immediate problems that
explode in the third century

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:08.400
are invasions and succession.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.767
Invasions by, first
of all, Persia.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.333
Persia is the old enemy
of the Roman Empire.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:22.833
Indeed, as many of you know,
the old enemy of the Greek

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:28.933
city-states that precede the
Roman Empire as far back as

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:33.400
the first historian of the
Western tradition, Herodotus--

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.700
first week of directed studies,
for those of you who

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.233
are nostalgic for that
experience--

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:41.400
Persia is the enemy.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.867
Now we never study Persia.

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.567
It's kind of like offstage
all the time.

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:47.900
And that's the great benefit
of the Department of Near

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.633
Eastern Languages
and Cultures.

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:55.433
If you want to learn about
Persia really from within,

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:57.567
instead of oh, my god,
the Persians.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.900
And it's oh, my god, the
Persians in 370 BC,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.800
[correction:470]

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.467
and it's going to
come to an end.

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:10.167
It is going to come to an end
in the seventh century.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:14.267
But that's because of Islam,
just to anticipate.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.633
But in the third century, Persia
becomes resurgent.

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:19.967
Having been rather passive, it
has this frontier with the

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:24.167
Roman Empire in the East. More
or less, buffer states are

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:28.067
Mesopotamia, present-day
Iraq, and Armenia.

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:30.233
It's not exactly the same as
the present-day state of

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:35.067
Armenia, but more like
eastern Turkey.

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:42.133
The dynasty that controls
Persia, and that is more

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:48.300
aggressive than its predecessor
are the Sassanids,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.700
and this appears in
your reading.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.100
The Sassanid Dynasty, the rulers
of Persia, just more

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.367
aggressive and more
adventurous.

00:06:55.367 --> 00:07:03.300
Beginning in 224, they start to
probe that frontier along

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.667
the Armenian and Mesopotamian
border, and eventually cross

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.100
it and start to wreak havoc in
some of the eastern provinces

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.800
of the Roman Empire.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.567
The climax of this is the
Emperor Valerian was captured

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:22.833
by the Persians in 260.

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:26.967
Valerian actually one of the
longer-reigning Emperor's of

00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:30.833
this chaotic period,
253 to 260.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.867
They kept him for
a little while.

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:37.100
Displayed him in chains,
maybe flayed him.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.033
Anyway, he died in captivity.

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:43.333
They did a kind of
a job on him.

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.767
I think maybe he was flayed
after he died, just not to be

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.733
too gruesome, but I think
they displayed the skin.

00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:51.867
As I said, I'm not a
Persian specialist.

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:58.067
But the second invasion
is across the

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:00.100
Danube-Rhine frontier.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.967
The Danube and the Rhine form
what the Romans thought of as

00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:06.700
a natural frontier with
the barbarian states.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.933
That didn't mean that they
didn't cross them.

00:08:08.933 --> 00:08:15.800
In fact, many of their great
fortresses and establishments

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.400
were on the eastern
side of the Rhine.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.733
But they considered those as
bulwarks against a dramatic

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:23.900
invasion across the Rhine.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.967
The Rhine and the Danube
almost meet--

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:31.633
the Rhine going from modern
Netherlands down to

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:36.867
Switzerland, and the Danube
going also from Germany

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:40.867
eventually Austria, Hungary,
into the Black Sea.

00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:44.433
As we'll see, Charlemagne, in
the early ninth century, tried

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.900
to build a canal between
the two of them.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.267
And there are actually traces of
this immense and completely

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:52.967
unsuccessful project.

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:55.900
And there now is a canal
between them.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.267
So this is sort of the frontier
of the Roman Empire,

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:01.267
and this is the line above which
wine grapes are grown,

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:02.233
[correction: wine grapes
become scarce]

00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:04.733
no olive oil is pressed.

00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:11.000
And it's got to be protected,
but not worth conquering.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.600
So we have pressure on the
Rhine-Danube frontiers in the

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.900
third century, and another
Emperor, Decius, died fighting

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.367
the Goths in 251, Decius.

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:27.400
And Valerian dies in 260.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.033
So the Emperors are certainly
out there as leaders, but that

00:09:33.033 --> 00:09:35.467
actually has to do with
the fact that

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:37.100
they're military guys.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.800
And that is part
of the problem.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.600
The major problem besides the
invasions was succession.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:50.500
It depends on how you count--

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.367
is someone a real Emperor, or
is he merely a pretender?--

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:59.667
there are at least 30 Emperors
between 235 and 285.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:02.767
Many of them ruling
for months, most

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.600
of them being killed.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.700
They're assassinated by the
Praetorian Guard, that is, by

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.467
their own troops.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:16.367
They're killed in battle against
foreign enemies, like

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:18.367
Decius and Valerian.

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:20.833
They're killed in battle against
other people claiming

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.733
to be Emperors.

00:10:23.733 --> 00:10:27.600
But the most common thing is
they're assassinated by their

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.833
own troops.

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:36.433
How had Roman Emperors
succeeded each other?

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:38.267
There were several ways.

00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:41.667
One is what you would expect,
and that is dynastic.

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:43.400
But that's not all
that common.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.267
Dynastic, in other words,
families rule.

00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:50.433
And the family is recognized
as a ruling family, and

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:57.533
therefore it goes from father to
son, or if there's no son,

00:10:57.533 --> 00:11:01.667
father to person daughter
marries, or father to nephew,

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.767
something like that.

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:07.667
But that was not actually
so common.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:16.533
Sometimes the next Emperor was
chosen by his predecessor.

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:20.767
This is characteristic of the
second century AD, the era of

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:23.967
the so-called good Emperors.

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:26.133
In theory, this is
a great system.

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:28.500
You have no family prejudice.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.567
You simply, as a good Emperor,
pick someone who looks to you

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.900
like he's going to be
a good Emperor.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.667
So that is another
possibility.

00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:48.500
Another possibility is some guy
is powerful, and uses his

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.400
troops to take over.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.400
And that's what we see
in the third century.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.133
We see not only the
militarization of the Empire,

00:11:56.133 --> 00:12:05.800
but the interference of the army
in raising successors, in

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.133
raising new Emperors.

00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:13.033
The army was able to make
and unmake Emperors.

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:17.533
Just as in some countries with
unstable political structures,

00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:21.867
the military is able to make
and unmake rulers.

00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:24.467
What is interesting about the
third century is that they're

00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:26.600
able to do it far from Rome.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.133
Some of these armies are
in North Africa.

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:30.700
Some of them are
on the frontier

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.467
fighting the Persians.

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:37.133
Rome is becoming less and less
relevant as the dominant city

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:38.333
of the Empire.

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:42.867
And I mentioned that now,
because we'll see on Wednesday

00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:46.200
the result of this is will be
the establishment of another

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.800
capital, a second capital in
the East, in what would be

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.267
called Constantinople,
modern Istanbul.

00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:58.967
Rome is fortified for
the first time.

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:01.733
There is a wall that you can
still see in many parts of

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:08.767
Rome, built by the Emperor
Aurelian in 271.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:13.000
And this is a significant thing,
because until 271 for

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.067
centuries, Rome had not been
walled, because it was not

00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:17.567
threatened.

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:24.000
And fortification in 271 starts
to indicate things to

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.767
come, or at least things that
we know are to come.

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:33.300
Namely, barbarian invasions,
just as the marginalization of

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.067
Rome begins at this time.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.300
Rome in the third century is
ruled, if one can call it

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.000
that, by a succession
of generals.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.633
Not members of an upper class
elite, but men who have come

00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:53.100
from the provinces.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.167
Men who are not particularly
well-educated, who would have

00:13:56.167 --> 00:14:03.033
trouble recognizing a tag from
Horace, there being no

00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:07.267
internet just to look
these quotes up.

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:10.633
They hold the traditional
Roman elite in contempt.

00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:15.567
The Senate of Rome is the
embodiment of that elite.

00:14:15.567 --> 00:14:20.300
The Roman Senate is a collection
of extremely

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.633
wealthy people, from good
families, extensive property,

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:30.700
and very, very fine education.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.833
The people leading in the third
century now are generals

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.267
raised by their troops.

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:39.667
One of the reasons that the
troops both raised up

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:42.200
generals, and then killed them,
was that they tended to

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.333
get a kind of reward from
the new Emperor--

00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.200
a thing called a donative.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.733
A donative is money
that you get when

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:52.267
there's a new Emperor.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.333
A bad idea from the point of
view of the Emperors, because

00:14:55.333 --> 00:15:01.300
it encourages double-dipping,
or triple-dipping.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.133
OK, now we've gotten our money
from this guy, let's kill him

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.600
and get money from
another guy.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.533
I don't think that's too cynical
to say that that is

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:11.433
some of what is going on.

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:14.100
Now of all the crises of the
third century, this is the one

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.433
that leaves the most
visible impression.

00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:19.633
There's absolutely no doubt that
there are all of these

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:21.933
different Emperors, and
that the top of the

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:23.933
government is unstable.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:28.233
The question is how much does
that carry over into the lives

00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:30.533
of ordinary people?

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:33.167
One measure of the effectiveness
of a

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:37.533
civilization is that is
survives, and even people

00:15:37.533 --> 00:15:42.533
don't comment very much on
political instability.

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:48.133
In a way, we are testing
that now.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:52.467
For many people, the fact that
the government is polarized

00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:55.067
doesn't really matter, in terms
of their everyday life.

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:59.033
How long can that go on?

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:03.500
That's partly because all sorts
of institutions are

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.100
functioning perfectly fine.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:05.933
Here we are.

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:08.100
We are meeting.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:14.200
There's no problem of the supply
of water suddenly, or

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:20.033
scarce provisioning, or
barbarians massed outside, and

00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.400
we have to sort of protect
against during our class.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.633
It hasn't come to that.

00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:28.733
Yet.

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:32.300
But if you look at the lives
of ordinary people in the

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:38.233
third century, they are not
saying not another Emperor, I

00:16:38.233 --> 00:16:41.333
can't take it anymore.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.067
The philosopher Plotinus, for
example, one of the great

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:45.733
intellectual figures
of this time.

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.700
Now it's true, he has a very
otherworldly way of thinking

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.367
about things.

00:16:49.367 --> 00:16:52.833
He is a follower of Plato, he's
the leading so-called

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:55.767
neo-Platonist philosopher,
flourishes during the third

00:16:55.767 --> 00:16:58.167
century, travels a bit.

00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:02.133
But we never hear of any
difficulty, any kind of

00:17:02.133 --> 00:17:05.967
problems raised by these
unstable conditions.

00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:09.800
The one that might have affected
more people than the

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.867
instability is inflation.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:18.000
Roman coinage was silver and
bronze, and based on ratios of

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.733
these metals to gold.

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:26.500
The ultimate standard of value
was gold, but bronze and

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.900
silver had attributed values
in relation to gold.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.567
The need to reward the army with
those donatives, and the

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:39.433
dislocations of the invasions
led to tremendous government

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.367
expenditures.

00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:46.233
And this was a society that did
not have debt financing.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.733
There are no bonds.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:52.200
There are no ways of the
government anticipating future

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.933
revenues and borrowing
money against them.

00:17:55.933 --> 00:17:58.700
That is actually an invention
of the Middle Ages.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.100
This is an example of something
that the Romans

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.867
didn't have that Medieval cities
in Italy pioneered,

00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:06.800
debt financing.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800
I don't have to tell
you what that is.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.733
And it's a great advantage,
up to a point.

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:16.233
Great advantage, because it
gives you leverage, allows you

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:17.467
to do things now.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:25.900
So how does a government deal
with problems like this if it

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.233
can't borrow money?

00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:30.200
It does what is called
debasing the coinage.

00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:38.333
To debase, that is degrade,
the coinage means that you

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:42.933
just don't put in as much silver
or bronze, let alone

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:46.467
gold, and try to get
people to accept it

00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:48.767
for its value anyway.

00:18:48.767 --> 00:18:54.233
So up until the 1970s, the
American currency was based on

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:58.267
gold, and dollar bills were
called silver certificates.

00:18:58.267 --> 00:19:05.067
They said that you could hand
this bill in for a dollar's

00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:06.133
worth of silver.

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:10.500
It was, technically speaking,
not currency.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.300
It was merely a representative
of currency, which

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.167
you could trade in.

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:19.233
And before that, of course,
the coins were metal.

00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:23.800
Dollars were both silver and
paper, with the silver one

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.233
being, in some sense,
the more real.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:31.533
It is in the nature of modern
government financing that, at

00:19:31.533 --> 00:19:33.000
some point, the government
could just say

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.233
forget about it.

00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:37.933
And even long before the
1970s, of course the

00:19:37.933 --> 00:19:42.033
government didn't have enough
silver for everyone to trade

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:47.533
them in, just as it doesn't have
enough gold in Fort Knox

00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.900
to float the entire
world's currency.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.467
It has a lot.

00:19:51.467 --> 00:19:55.533
And that's important that there
be some real kind of

00:19:55.533 --> 00:20:00.667
value, or bullion, or bottom
line kind of gold bars.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:04.600
But the fact that it's
not enough is not

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.733
intrinsically a problem.

00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:13.000
But here, so let's say the
government receives, in the

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.700
form of taxes and stuff,
a thousand gold units.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.533
And it issues two thousand
units using that gold.

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:28.133
The coins say they're worth a
unit, but they're actually, in

00:20:28.133 --> 00:20:31.567
terms of precious metal
value, worth a half.

00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:33.733
So it pays its expenses
that way.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.133
It pays the army.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.767
It gets people to accept
this money.

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:44.267
But when most people go to buy
stuff, they are going to find

00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:50.100
that the stuff is 50% more
expensive, because their coins

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.933
are not actually very good.

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:56.433
The governments tend to do this
gradually, hoping the

00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:59.800
people don't notice in the first
place, or that if the

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.467
inflation is say, 10%,
it's not so bad.

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:06.867
But once having embarked on the
debasement of the coinage,

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:10.033
this tends to get out of control
because of the famous

00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:12.633
Gresham's law-- an 18th
century economist--

00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:15.433
that bad money drives
out good.

00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:23.733
If I have good sestertia, or
Roman currency, with the full

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:28.233
measure of silver that they say
they have, one full unit,

00:21:28.233 --> 00:21:31.933
and I've got other coins that
say one full unit, but only

00:21:31.933 --> 00:21:36.533
have half, I'm going to try to
get rid of the bad ones and

00:21:36.533 --> 00:21:38.467
hoard the good ones.

00:21:38.467 --> 00:21:42.067
And only spend the good ones
if I absolutely have to, or

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.833
demand a premium on them.

00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:48.367
So therefore, there are all
these crappy coins circulating

00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:54.400
like mad, and the good ones
retreat into peoples' wealth--

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.533
they don't really have
mattresses then-- but into

00:21:56.533 --> 00:22:01.467
their store boxes, or under
their beds, creating in itself

00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:05.033
more and more inflation.

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:07.133
So you have a fierce
inflation.

00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:08.300
Prices go up.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.167
People don't know the
value of things.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.167
They start bartering.

00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:15.633
And the Roman economy is very,
very adversely affected, as

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:17.933
hyperinflation tends to.

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:26.333
And a final problem is the
ruin of the local elite,

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:31.033
partly because of this economic
chaos, but partly

00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:33.967
from deeper causes.

00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:36.433
The importance of this is
something that I alluded to

00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:40.267
last time, and that is that the
Empire could not be held

00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:44.033
together, really, by the
government, however big the

00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:45.633
government was.

00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:50.867
It required the cooperation of
wealthy people with ties to

00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:52.300
their native city.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.067
It was these people who
sponsored games, civic

00:22:56.067 --> 00:23:01.567
improvements, maintained the
temples, and kept a kind of

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:04.633
local order.

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:09.833
The third century crisis
undermines this elite.

00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:12.700
This elite is undermined by the
militarization of society.

00:23:15.767 --> 00:23:19.800
They are, to some extent,
ruined by taxation and

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.233
increased taxation.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:24.633
They're just powerful enough
to be well-off, but not

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:29.833
powerful enough to
evade taxation.

00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:35.300
But they also tend to be
undermined by an Empire that's

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.467
more cosmopolitan, where local
elites don't matter as much.

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:43.767
Where, for example, military
people who move around a lot,

00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:45.600
are more important.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.333
And I emphasize this, not only
because of these elites

00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:54.300
themselves and their role in
holding the Empire together,

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.367
but we're going to talk about
this when we talk about

00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:57.900
Christianity.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.067
Because when the local
elites are

00:24:00.067 --> 00:24:03.567
ruined, so is local religion.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:07.367
And local religion
means polytheism.

00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:13.600
If I am of a grand family of,
let's say the city of Sardis

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.300
in Asia Minor, in modern Turkey,
and I feel that my

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.233
ancestors have always been
involved in the worship of the

00:24:20.233 --> 00:24:25.633
goddess Cybele and I am a
votary, or an officer, or like

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:31.167
a member of the governing board
of the club, or society

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:35.667
that runs the cult of Cybele,
I'm going to feel very loyal

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:39.067
to that local deity.

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:42.333
But if I come from North Africa,
and I'm in Sardis

00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:45.267
because that's where my army
is, I'm not going to don't

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:47.067
care about some local.

00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:54.767
No more than you might care
about a club that's important

00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:58.167
at Yale, if you went to the
University of Illinois.

00:24:58.167 --> 00:25:03.733
No more important than you might
feel about pizza in New

00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:07.433
Haven, if you came from
somewhere else

00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:08.967
and didn't like pizza.

00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:12.933
It's just like this local cult,
and you don't understand

00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:14.900
it, and you don't care.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.067
So the kind of things you will
care about, we'll see,

00:25:20.067 --> 00:25:20.933
religiously.

00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:24.600
But they will tend to be
religions that cross borders,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.633
like Christianity.

00:25:25.633 --> 00:25:30.300
Religions that are not
identified with one place and

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.467
one god, in the sense of local
god, local temple, my people.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.100
So into this mess Diocletian--
because Diocletian defeats his

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.100
predecessor, Carinus
in battle in 284.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.933
Diocletian is a general.

00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:51.033
In 284, it would have seemed
like more of the same.

00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:56.167
But Diocletian rules until
305 and he abdicates.

00:25:56.167 --> 00:26:01.667
He passes the power
to someone else.

00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:04.567
He is, however, very typical
of the military

00:26:04.567 --> 00:26:05.967
class of the Empire.

00:26:05.967 --> 00:26:08.767
He came from nowhere,
socially.

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:12.967
He was the son of an ex-slave
from Dalmatia,

00:26:12.967 --> 00:26:14.767
modern coastal Croatia.

00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:18.833
You can still see his palace in
the Croatian city of Split

00:26:18.833 --> 00:26:21.200
on the Adriatic.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.933
His retirement palace,
actually.

00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:29.800
Under his severe guidance,
the Empire was reformed.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.433
And the way it was reformed was
that it was, in effect,

00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:35.067
militarized.

00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:37.567
Diocletian was not a great
general, but he was a

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:39.633
brilliant manager.

00:26:39.633 --> 00:26:44.400
And he was a brilliant
bureaucratic organizer.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.800
I used the term bureaucracy,
not to mean inefficient,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.233
useless administration,
but administration.

00:26:53.233 --> 00:26:58.000
Administration officers of the
state, who are capable of

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.067
doing their jobs, or maybe not
capable of doing their jobs.

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:02.133
But who are nevertheless--

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:04.567
I'm not making a value judgment
with the term

00:27:04.567 --> 00:27:04.867
bureaucracy--

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:08.633
I simply mean the proliferation
of government

00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:10.900
and government offices.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:17.733
Diocletian is responsible for
the militarization of society.

00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:20.967
That is, building society around
the army in order to

00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:21.967
protect it.

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:26.833
And he is responsible for
a more efficient, and

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:29.867
ultimately, burdensome
form of taxation.

00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:35.533
The two are enlinked because, as
we know, you have to pay to

00:27:35.533 --> 00:27:38.933
have a large and effective
military.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.300
Diocletian did not set out
to be a revolutionary.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.133
His aims were conservative.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:52.933
He wanted to save, preserve,
restore, the Roman Empire of

00:27:52.933 --> 00:28:01.133
the pre-235 era.

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:03.067
His methods were radical.

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:08.133
He was willing to undertake
radical measures.

00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:09.967
And the debate among
historians,

00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:11.067
now somewhat muted.

00:28:11.067 --> 00:28:13.433
Many historians at one time
felt that he had basically

00:28:13.433 --> 00:28:14.800
destroyed the Empire.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.100
By making it so bureaucratic,
so militarized, so

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.033
heavy-handed, in terms of
government, it no longer was

00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:22.133
the Roman Empire.

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:23.567
It was something else.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:30.967
Now the reason this is no longer
exactly considered to

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:33.867
be a big problem, or a big
controversy, you'll see when

00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:35.300
we come to read Wickham.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.200
The Empire has an impress
on society.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.067
There is what he calls the
Burden of Empire, but it is,

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:47.233
at the same time, not a
totalitarian empire that

00:28:47.233 --> 00:28:49.400
controls everything.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.867
Society has an identity that's
different from the government.

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:59.000
So he has three goals.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.433
One, solving this problem of
the imperial succession.

00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:07.167
Two, stabilizing the economy.

00:29:07.167 --> 00:29:09.533
Three, protecting
the frontiers.

00:29:12.233 --> 00:29:14.833
Of these three, he's actually
only really successful in the

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:17.400
third, protecting
the frontiers.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.433
He devises a system, that we're
going to talk about in a

00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:23.367
moment, of succession, but
it does not really

00:29:23.367 --> 00:29:26.800
outlast him very long.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.100
The economy does get fixed but,
not exactly because of

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.333
his policies.

00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:38.900
What he's really successful
at, and what changes most

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.833
dramatically, is what
rulership means.

00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:47.600
That includes the figure of the
Emperor, who becomes more

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.500
sacred and more powerful, in
terms of imagery, as well as

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.900
administration.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.000
Changes in the administration,
of taxes in particular, and

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.267
then that goal of his to change
and grow the military.

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:12.700
The size of the army grew,
probably doubled.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.600
Maybe, just as a ballpark
figure, from 200,000 troops to

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.467
400,000 troops.

00:30:21.467 --> 00:30:23.467
This is a major, major
increase that

00:30:23.467 --> 00:30:24.667
had to be paid for.

00:30:24.667 --> 00:30:30.433
And it had to be paid for
by taxation, and from a

00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:32.467
population not particularly
eager to

00:30:32.467 --> 00:30:35.733
volunteer to pay more.

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.800
Ultimately, it looks as if
Diocletian didn't so much

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.633
increase taxation, as increase
the efficiency of its

00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:43.167
collection.

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:45.500
In order to increase the
efficiency of his collection,

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.467
he had to increase the
bureaucracy charged with

00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:49.900
monitoring the taxes.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.300
And that means first making an

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.800
inventory of taxable resources.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.333
There is no income tax in this
society because it's an

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:02.467
economy based more on land
than on salaries.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.233
An income tax is easy because
you can keep records of what

00:31:11.233 --> 00:31:13.567
people are earning.

00:31:13.567 --> 00:31:17.167
The government, to this day,
finds it much easier to take a

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:22.100
portion of your wages, because
it knows from your company

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.667
what you're being paid.

00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:27.733
If you're being paid in some
other form, like you're a

00:31:27.733 --> 00:31:33.600
waiter, and a lot of your
money is in tips, that's

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.800
harder for the government.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.000
If your wealth is in property,
it's hard to

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.600
put a value on that.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.733
You own estates.

00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:51.367
You have people who are free
tenants, who rent land from

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:56.533
you, and pay you in money,
or produce, or labor.

00:31:56.533 --> 00:31:58.533
You have some slaves.

00:31:58.533 --> 00:32:02.033
You have a water mill.

00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:06.067
How do you pay taxes on
all of this stuff.

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:08.900
The opportunities for
evasion are greater.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.567
So the first bureaucratic tasks
was just to have a lot

00:32:11.567 --> 00:32:15.567
of people could value things,
who could come into a

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:19.900
territory and say OK, this farm
is worth so much, and it

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.833
has these many people.

00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:28.233
They develop a system to
evaluate productive units of

00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:32.500
things like land, and
population, and to tax them

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.767
according to a formula.

00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:38.833
So I have a lot of land, but
it's not very good land.

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:41.567
I don't have a lot of people
making a living off it.

00:32:41.567 --> 00:32:45.000
I will be taxed at a lower rate
than someone was maybe

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.467
half that land, but twice the
people, better soil, more

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:53.233
clearance of forest, whatever
the reason.

00:32:53.233 --> 00:32:55.067
It changes.

00:32:55.067 --> 00:32:59.333
So every 15 years, the
government changes its

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:00.667
estimation.

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:09.333
A second means, once you have
this taxation system in place,

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:13.500
of bringing the Empire together
and dominating it

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.867
more, is to have the army really
have first call on the

00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:21.600
resources of the state.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.267
We now start to have a
state supply system

00:33:24.267 --> 00:33:27.367
for the army alone.

00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:30.367
This allows the state to
avoid dealing with

00:33:30.367 --> 00:33:32.000
that debased currency.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.167
So for example, the state just
goes in and takes wheat and

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:39.567
gives it to the army, without
taking money, buying wheat,

00:33:39.567 --> 00:33:40.800
giving that to the army.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.433
Diocletian binds the Empire
together, also very

00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:48.633
effectively, by a
postal system.

00:33:48.633 --> 00:33:53.100
Post in this case meaning a
system of riders, horses,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.933
communications, that allows the
Emperor to go faster than

00:33:56.933 --> 00:34:00.133
anyone else, to have news
quicker than anyone else, to

00:34:00.133 --> 00:34:02.233
send orders quicker
than anyone else.

00:34:06.133 --> 00:34:12.233
And also, more punishment for
things like tax evasion.

00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:15.500
It's not just that people get
killed for not paying their

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.700
taxes, or imprisoned, or
tortured, but that groups are

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.800
responsible.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.067
Not only that if I don't pay my
taxes, I get punished, but

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:28.533
if you and I live in the same
village, and you don't pay

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.467
your taxes, I get punished.

00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:34.400
Or at the very least, taxed for
the part that you evaded.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.867
But the most important change
in government is the

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:44.967
establishment of what's
called the Tetrarchy.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.567
The Tetrarchy is the
rule of four.

00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:59.800
Four rulers Diocletian divides
the Empire, first in two--

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.900
East, West. A very significant
move that will have

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.667
consequences for the
next 1,200 years.

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:19.033
He then appoints a co-Emporer to
rule in the West, while he

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:28.367
rules in the East. And they each
appoint a helper, number

00:35:28.367 --> 00:35:29.567
three and number four.

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:37.267
The two Emperors are called
Augusti, Emperors, and the two

00:35:37.267 --> 00:35:40.767
helpers are Caesars.

00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:49.700
So they're subordinate to their
respective Augusti, and

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.267
they're supposed to help them.

00:35:51.267 --> 00:35:53.867
Why this system?

00:35:53.867 --> 00:35:56.767
This is really to overcome
the problems of size,

00:35:56.767 --> 00:35:59.633
communication, administration.

00:35:59.633 --> 00:36:03.400
It's a statement that the
Empire is too big

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.167
for one man to rule.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:18.833
But the chief Emperors
are also exalted now.

00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:20.633
There's no longer
a pretense that

00:36:20.633 --> 00:36:23.000
they're just first citizens.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.433
or princes.

00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:27.067
They are clothed in purple.

00:36:27.067 --> 00:36:32.867
They don't move a lot
in public audiences.

00:36:32.867 --> 00:36:35.267
We're familiar with this kind
of dichotomy between the

00:36:35.267 --> 00:36:38.433
political figure as distant
authority, versus the

00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:40.800
political figure at least
pretending to be just

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.900
like you and me.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.267
We're in the era
of the latter.

00:36:44.267 --> 00:36:48.467
The Diocletianic period ushers
in a period when the Emperor

00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:54.767
is distant, glimpsed, product
of ceremonies, wearing a lot

00:36:54.767 --> 00:36:59.100
of very funny-looking,
but fancy clothes.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.867
He doesn't appear
a lot in public.

00:37:01.867 --> 00:37:03.100
He's a god.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:12.233
You don't go up to him and
shake hands, or say hi.

00:37:12.233 --> 00:37:15.767
You throw yourself at his feet,
and don't look at him

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:17.067
until he tells you to.

00:37:20.433 --> 00:37:25.133
So the tetrarchy, great idea,
it really doesn't work.

00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:27.633
Because, first of all,
the Emperors

00:37:27.633 --> 00:37:29.467
don't necessarily cooperate.

00:37:29.467 --> 00:37:33.700
The Caesars don't necessarily
cooperate with the Emperors.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:43.800
And so in 285 Diocletian
nominates a Caesar, and then

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.033
makes him, in 286,
a co-Augustus.

00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:49.667
And this man is named
Maximian.

00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:04.767
In 293, Diocletian and Maximian
appoint two Caesars.

00:38:04.767 --> 00:38:09.000
I think I'm not going to burden
you with the personnel.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.300
I will hand out something on
Wednesday that gives you some

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.833
of this information.

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:19.300
Diocletian and Maximian appoint
Galerius in the East

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.767
and Constantius in the Western--
you don't have to

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:22.467
remember who these are--

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.333
and each of them marries
a daughter of

00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:26.333
their respective Augusti.

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:29.467
This looks like a
great system.

00:38:29.467 --> 00:38:33.967
In 305, Diocletian and Maximian
abdicate and then two

00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:35.367
people become Augusti.

00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:40.600
The two Caesars rise up to be
Augusti and they appoint their

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.867
own new Caesars.

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:47.167
It breaks down beginning
in 306.

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:50.133
One of the sons of one of
these Augusti is not

00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:53.267
appointed, and he's mad,
and he revolts.

00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:58.000
And then the Augusti
don't get along.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.633
Out of this chaos between 306
and 312 emerges one Emperor.

00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:06.400
And that is Constantine.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.567
And we'll be talking about
Constantine on Wednesday.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.733
So the Tetrarchy fails.

00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:23.333
Diocletian's second big
initiative was over this

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:27.600
question of the economy, and
ways of combating inflation.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.500
Diocletian issued a so-called
edict on prices.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.000
The edict on prices
attempted to set a

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.200
fixed price for goods.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.433
And if you sold them for more
than that, you were to be

00:39:43.433 --> 00:39:45.700
severely punished.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:51.900
This is the kind of classic
example of the state trying to

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.567
combat inflation by
dictating prices.

00:39:55.567 --> 00:40:01.067
Most of you are not familiar
with inflation, because we

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:05.100
have lived in an era of
very low interest and

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.900
fairly stable prices.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.800
But if you think of those
commodities whose inflation

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.100
you are familiar with, like
petroleum, it is very

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.000
dislocating.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.600
It starts to create panics, and
the panics then feed into

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.500
the inflation.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.400
Just as, if people keep on
getting gas because they think

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.100
that it's going to go up in
price, then there's a greater

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.567
demand for gasoline, and it
goes up further in price.

00:40:30.567 --> 00:40:35.000
Eventually, if the thing is
really just speculative, it

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.133
deflates again.

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:38.167
And that's what's happened
with products that we're

00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:40.133
familiar with in recent times.

00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:44.600
But there is also a kind of
structural, longer-term

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.733
inflation such as America
experienced, for

00:40:46.733 --> 00:40:48.400
example, in the '70s.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.567
And in theory, if you have
resource crises and things

00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:56.533
that are becoming scarcer, then
you ought to have more

00:40:56.533 --> 00:41:01.233
and more experience
with inflation.

00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:04.700
The government in the 1970s in
the United States tried also

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.267
to have an edict on prices.

00:41:07.267 --> 00:41:12.400
Under President Ford, there was
a kind of administration

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.533
of maximum prices.

00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:18.067
The problem with this is that
it creates a temptation for

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:21.333
black markets, creates a version
of what we were just

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:24.867
talking about with Gresham's
law of coinage.

00:41:24.867 --> 00:41:29.767
If you say that tomatoes can
only be sold for a dollar a

00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:33.067
pound, then those tomatoes
that are being sold for a

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:36.167
dollar a pound in a climate of
severe inflation will be

00:41:36.167 --> 00:41:40.167
terrible, will be rotten.

00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:44.067
If you want to pay $2.00 a pound
in secret, we have some

00:41:44.067 --> 00:41:45.667
nice tomatoes for you.

00:41:45.667 --> 00:41:48.733
And if you want to pay $5.00 a
pound, we have some really

00:41:48.733 --> 00:41:54.333
nice, locally-grown
tomatoes for you.

00:41:54.333 --> 00:42:00.467
All of which may be illegal, but
the legal market is empty.

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:03.000
And this is what happened
in response to

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.100
the edict of prices.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.833
This doesn't mean that the
government cannot--

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:09.000
I mean it still remains
debatable, obviously, the

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.833
degree to which government
can or cannot

00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:14.133
intervene in such things--

00:42:14.133 --> 00:42:17.600
but certainly, in the case of
the Roman Empire, this failed.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:25.267
What did bring back a measure
of economic stability is the

00:42:25.267 --> 00:42:26.267
reform of the taxation.

00:42:26.267 --> 00:42:30.267
The fact that the state simply
started getting in more

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:36.200
resources, that less was being
withheld by private people,

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.200
and so the state could
actually pay for its

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.767
administrative and
military costs.

00:42:46.233 --> 00:42:51.400
So Diocletian succeeded in
abdicating peacefully, spent

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:58.267
his retirement in Split in his
palace, and lived to see the

00:42:58.267 --> 00:43:01.367
breakdown, or the partial
breakdown of the Tetrarchy.

00:43:01.367 --> 00:43:06.800
And in certain respects, his
policies clearly failed.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.533
The edict on prices had to be
abandoned, the Tetrarchy did

00:43:11.533 --> 00:43:17.767
not work, and Diocletian failed
in trying to suppress

00:43:17.767 --> 00:43:18.500
Christianity.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.967
We'll talk about this some more,
but Diocletian, in the

00:43:20.967 --> 00:43:26.233
late part of his reign, a couple
animals were split open

00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:29.300
to see what the future
would be.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:29.933
Right?

00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:35.433
Isn't that what we all do if you
want to figure out what's

00:43:35.433 --> 00:43:36.733
going to happen?

00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:40.633
You slaughter an animal and
check out its liver.

00:43:40.633 --> 00:43:42.333
Maybe its kidneys
and spleen, too.

00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:44.800
But the liver is really what
you want to look at.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.067
And I don't exactly know what
the animal was, what the

00:43:50.067 --> 00:43:55.100
organs were, and why they didn't
splay out right, but

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.267
the liver told Diocletian
that the Christians were

00:43:57.267 --> 00:44:00.467
responsible for this, and that
he'd better go after them.

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.100
So there is this big persecution
of Christians in

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.600
the first part of the
fourth century.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.133
And he certainly didn't
succeed in that.

00:44:09.133 --> 00:44:13.567
Not only did the Christians
not crumble, but of course

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:16.567
Diocletian's most effective
successor, six years after he

00:44:16.567 --> 00:44:18.800
abdicated, would convert
to Christianity.

00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:25.600
But Diocletian is extremely
important, and in many

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.100
respects, extremely
successful.

00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:34.167
He did more than prop up
a tottering Empire.

00:44:37.867 --> 00:44:40.800
He did more than just transform
a tottering Empire

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.133
into a kind of tottering
tyranny.

00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:47.167
He saved the Roman Empire.

00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:49.733
He saved the Roman Empire
for 100 years.

00:44:49.733 --> 00:44:53.967
When you take a course like this
that goes for 700, 800

00:44:53.967 --> 00:44:57.767
years, you start to hurl
centuries around and get

00:44:57.767 --> 00:44:59.067
confused among them.

00:44:59.067 --> 00:45:03.200
But any polity that exists
for 100 years is fairly

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.367
impressive.

00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:08.467
Or a polity that looks like it's
about to collapse, and

00:45:08.467 --> 00:45:11.833
then is restored
for 100 years.

00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:14.833
The Roman Empire, conventionally
speaking, is

00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:16.533
thought to have collapsed
in the West in

00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:17.800
the late fifth century.

00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:25.200
In the East however, arguably,
Diocletian's reforms last for

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.233
more on the order
of 1,200 years.

00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:31.200
The Eastern Empire, the
Byzantine Empire

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.900
would fall in 1453.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.633
And to its last day, it was
modeled on Diocletianic

00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:48.867
administrative and
military forms.

00:45:48.867 --> 00:45:53.467
People at the time clearly
thought that they'd been saved

00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:55.133
from disaster.

00:45:55.133 --> 00:45:58.900
If you look at fourth century
artifacts, things like mosaics

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.833
on the floors of dining rooms,
people often put mottos there.

00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:05.200
And their mottos are things
like "Joyful times

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:13.200
everywhere." or "A world
restored." The fourth century

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:19.167
is interpretable as an era of
increasing gloom, because we

00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:22.500
know that in the fifth century
things are going to collapse.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.767
But people in the fourth century
are not saying to each

00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:28.533
other, I'm so glad I'm alive in
the fourth century, because

00:46:28.533 --> 00:46:31.733
I don't want to see what's going
to happen in the fifth.

00:46:31.733 --> 00:46:34.700
They are just happy that the
barbarians are back across the

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.333
Danube and the Rhine, the
Persians are more or less

00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:41.600
controlled along the frontier.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.300
Yes, taxes are high.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.967
Yes, the elite is some sort of
riff-raff, and not as well

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:49.467
educated, and they're
military people.

00:46:49.467 --> 00:46:53.967
But basically, things are
working, prosperity is

00:46:53.967 --> 00:46:58.233
restored to the people who had
been prosperous before, the

00:46:58.233 --> 00:47:01.133
local elites have declined,
but it's not so

00:47:01.133 --> 00:47:03.500
visible as it had been.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.500
But there are some changes.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.900
Changes that we can, with the
proverbial benefit of

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.367
hindsight, see.

00:47:09.367 --> 00:47:12.100
Changes in the center
of gravity.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.633
The dominant places are
now places that

00:47:14.633 --> 00:47:15.767
are military bases.

00:47:15.767 --> 00:47:20.600
They are great cities, with
all the amenities of Rome.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.967
That is, stadiums, gateways.

00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:26.133
One of the best-preserved
of these to this

00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:28.133
day is Trier in Germany.

00:47:31.167 --> 00:47:33.500
Trier, on the Moselle behind
[correction: west of]

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:39.800
the Rhine, has a wonderful
collection of Roman ruins.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:50.567
A gateway, the Porta Nigra, a
theater, a sports arena, a

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:54.767
basilica, a law court turned
into a church.

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:58.100
The reason trier was great was
because of the frontier.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.733
It was one of the most important
cities in the Empire

00:48:00.733 --> 00:48:02.667
because of the military, because
of its strategic

00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:03.567
importance.

00:48:03.567 --> 00:48:05.167
And there are other cities
that are like.

00:48:05.167 --> 00:48:09.067
Milan, for example, becomes
more important than Rome.

00:48:09.067 --> 00:48:12.800
Because Milan is further north,
it's a good place to

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.733
get to the Danube and to the
Rhine quickly, whereas Rome is

00:48:16.733 --> 00:48:18.367
buried in the Mediterranean.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.867
So we're in a new world.

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:26.167
We'll discuss more of the
new world on Wednesday.

00:48:26.167 --> 00:48:29.367
And we will see that
Constantine, in some cases,

00:48:29.367 --> 00:48:31.167
completely revolutionizes
things.

00:48:31.167 --> 00:48:35.300
And in other cases, continues
Diocletian's work.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.126
Prof: All right,
so I'm going to finish talking

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:05.630
about overlapping generations
today.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.512
I'm going to defer my plan to
save Social Security till a

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:13.186
couple of lectures from now,
and I'm going to start to

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:15.960
introduce uncertainty in this
class.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.785
The exam will only cover the
stuff up to basically the last

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:21.950
problem set.
 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.605
There are a few things about
overlapping generations I might

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:26.424
say today,
which will clarify what you

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:28.942
already know,
but you don't have to know

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:32.890
anything beyond the problem you
turned in on Thursday--

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.200
you're turning in today.
 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.988
So you I think are better
informed now than you were

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:39.880
yesterday.
 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.117
I think it's a big help to be
doing the problems,

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:46.220
so for those of you watching on
screen at home,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.570
do the problems.
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.477
So remember we had a situation
where there were generations,

00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:56.637
each of whom was rich when
young and poor when old,

00:00:56.637 --> 00:00:58.800
that looked like that.
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.740
And it went on forever.
 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.880
That was the only difference
from what we've had before.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.700
People's lives were shorter
than the lifetime of the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.650
economy,
and to go to the extreme,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.554
the economy goes on forever,
even though people only live

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:13.620
two periods.
 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.010
And then there was land,
1,1, 1,1.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.677
There's land,
and then there's

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:28.774
generation--because I forgot the
generation--here's generation 0,

00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:32.063
generation 1,
generation 2,

00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:34.720
generation 3...
 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.519
and time.
 

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.170
This is time.
 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.135
And here's time 1,
time 2, time 3,

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.780
time 4, time 5,
etc.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.412
Now this model,
I've been told,

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:48.970
is the hardest thing you do the
entire class.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.471
Things are going to get much
more complicated,

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:54.530
but since they build up slowly,
I think this model's the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.310
hardest thing you have to do the
entire class.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.849
I realize it's a little bit
confusing, but in the end,

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.670
I don't think it's that
complicated.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.840
And it reveals all the subtlety
of Fisher's thinking,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.253
not that Fisher understood
about overlapping generations,

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.449
but his ideas,
you can see here.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.908
So what are his ideas?
 

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:15.622
You've got a complicated model
in which you've got people

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:18.938
trading apples when they're
young, against land.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:26.787
So the objects in the economy
are land, which you're supposed

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:34.502
to think of as the stock market,
okay, so we've got land and

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:37.250
we've got apples.
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.841
Now what's interesting is,
the land is going to constantly

00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:43.050
change hands.
 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.869
So the young here are going to
buy the land,

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.240
but when they get old,
they're going to sell the land.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.180
So the land is constantly
changing hands.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.873
It's not that one person buys
it at the beginning and holds it

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:53.479
forever.
 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:03:00.723
So Fisher's formula,
remember, was that the price of

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:09.530
any asset was going to be equal
to the discounted dividends.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.520
And the logic seemed to be at
the time that the price,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.889
you know, if the person was
going to buy the asset,

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.214
that they could take the money
now or they could wait and get

00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:20.770
all the dividends in the future,
and they would compare what

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.264
they would get out of the
dividends in the future to what

00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:24.598
they have to give up today.
 

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:25.729
But you see,
in this example,

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.060
it's a little more complicated.
 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.860
Nobody's going to hold the land
and get all the dividends.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.704
Each person who buys the land
knows that he's going to sell it

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:38.169
long before getting all the
dividends from that land.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.560
And yet the price of the land
is still given by this formula,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.930
so we never use the fact,
in Fisher's argument,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.310
that the same person had to
hold the asset till the end.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.282
And so now we have a case,
an extreme case,

00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:52.628
where people only hold the
asset for one period.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.395
It's always turning over,
turning over,

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.205
turning over,
but still the price of the

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.389
asset is equal to the discounted
dividends.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.943
So the secret to solving this
problem, according to Fisher is,

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:04.810
forget about the asset.
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.408
That makes it too complicated.
 

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:09.288
Fisher's argument again is,
take financial equilibrium--

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:12.158
maybe I should write it on a
different board--

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:18.319
Fisher's argument is,
financial equilibrium,

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.810
equilibrium, okay.
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.860
Get rid of assets.
 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:33.252
Put dividends into endowments,
and transform it into general

00:04:33.252 --> 00:04:37.249
equilibrium,
the very thing you saw within

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.237
the first couple days of class,
okay, and then go backwards and

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:44.440
figure out what the financial
equilibrium is.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.903
So although it seemed very easy
before, it's a little subtler

00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:50.269
this time, but it's the same
principle.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:55.339
Whose endowment should you put
the dividends into?

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.259
The land is changing hands all
the time.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.336
There's a new guy owning it,
a new guy owning it every

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:01.302
period,
so whose endowments do we

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:04.451
increase when we put the
dividends of the land into

00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:05.899
someone's endowment?
 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:09.290
You put it into the endowment
of the guy who owned it first.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.947
So put dividends into
endowments of original owners,

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:18.000
okay?
 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.310
So this old person who has the
right to the first apple,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.860
his own endowment of an apple,
and also the right to the first

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.899
dividend,
but he actually has a right to

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:29.750
all the dividends.
 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.529
So his endowment,
the endowment of Mr.

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.899
0 is going to be 2,1,
1,1, etc.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.264
Because he has his original
apple, plus he's got--he has his

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:45.036
endowment of an apple,
because everyone when they're

00:05:45.036 --> 00:05:46.589
old has an apple.
 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.910
He's also, because he's owned
the land before,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.610
gotten the right to this first
dividend of the apple,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.459
that's 2, and because he's the
original owner of land,

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:58.420
he owns all the future dividend
streams of the land.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.581
So we can forget about land
after we've stuck the dividends

00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.581
into the right person's
endowment, and now we just trade

00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.490
as if it's general equilibrium.
 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.067
We just look for supply and
demand and the present value

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:13.057
prices, which are p_1,
p_2,

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:15.009
p_3,
etc., okay?

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.122
And because it's symmetric,
we know that this is going to

00:06:19.122 --> 00:06:23.091
equal 1--
p--we can always make one of

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.675
them be--
one price can be 1,

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:30.040
so the present value prices are
going to look like this.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.829
The reason I can make this
simplification is by symmetry.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:38.336
Every generation is the same,
so it's obvious that I'll be

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:43.319
able to keep repeating the same
argument over and over again.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.706
Okay, and so what do I have--so
remember, the land has

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.279
disappeared here.
 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.985
Even though this generation is
buying the land and selling the

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:54.427
land, in Fisher's story,
you don't have to pay attention

00:06:54.427 --> 00:06:54.959
to that.
 

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.992
This guy bought the land,
and then he sold the land,

00:06:57.992 --> 00:06:59.480
so it was a fair trade.
 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.920
So he started without it and
ended without it.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.365
The fact that in between he
used the land to save,

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:07.910
you can already do that in a
general equilibrium.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.350
You don't need to think about
the land,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.103
because the only reason this
guy is buying the land is to use

00:07:12.103 --> 00:07:14.613
it for a means of saving,
which is already in Fisher's

00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:15.050
equation.
 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.339
So to solve for equilibrium is
then quite simple.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.389
We just, in every generation,
we look at--

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.879
remember, I forgot to write the
utility functions,

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:32.762
so we have U of consumption
when young and old is 1 half log

00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:37.850
young [consumption]
1 half log old [consumption].

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.180
Okay, and so therefore,
in equilibrium,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.363
we have to have that 1 half
times the income of every

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:47.459
generation--
every generation's going to

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.649
have 3 when young 1 when old.
 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.290
Now from the point of view of
any generation t,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.930
the prices are p,
say, p_2 when young

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.709
and p_3 when old.
 

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.930
Now remember,
any generation cares only about

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.839
relative prices.
 

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:02.233
So I can call them
p_2 or p_3,

00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:05.065
or I can call them 1 and p,
because the ratio's going to be

00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:05.360
p.
 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360
So, much simpler to think of
the prices as 1 and p.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.637
So the old guy,
if I'm doing any t,

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:13.048
like this period 4,
the old guy here,

00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:16.600
you know, that's p_4
and p_3.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.500
He cares about p_3
and p_4.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.744
But he only cares about the
ratio of p_3 and

00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:21.930
p_4,
which is p.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.476
So from his point of view,
he might as well have thought

00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:25.449
of them as 1 and p.
 

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:29.233
So his income is 3 1p,
and he's going to spend half

00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:33.094
his income on that good,
which for him is a relative

00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:34.230
price of p.
 

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.514
The young guy is going to spend
half his income,

00:08:38.514 --> 00:08:40.428
which is also 3 1p.
 

00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:43.090
This is the relative price
between t - 1 and t.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.779
This is the relative price
between t and t 1.

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:51.133
But he's now young,
so his price when young is 1,

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:57.155
and that has to = 3 1 1 =-- so
I wrote it as 1 3 1 = 5,

00:08:57.155 --> 00:08:58.158
okay?
 

00:08:58.158 --> 00:09:03.860
And we solved that,
and we found that p = .55.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.639
So are there any questions
about how we did that?

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:07.240
That's where we ended the last
lecture.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.169
Is that clear to everyone?
 

00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:08.750
Yes.
 

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:14.110
Student:
&gt;

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.178
Prof: Okay.
 

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:20.470
If I didn't have symmetry,
I would have to say this is--

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.918
I would have to write this--in
general,

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:30.539
this would be 3p_t-1
1p_t over

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:34.836
p_t,
and this guy would be

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:38.750
3p_t 1 p_t
1,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.889
divided by p_t.
 

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:42.288
Right?
 

00:09:42.288 --> 00:09:45.320
That would be,
in general, if I had prices,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.745
the present value prices,
this guy's income would be

00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:54.625
given by that,
because he's the old at time t,

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:58.909
and the young would be given by
that,

00:09:58.909 --> 00:09:59.480
okay?
 

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.269
And I'd have to do this,
a new equation,

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.629
for every t.
 

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:05.320
Who asked?
 

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.940
You asked the question,
so does that make sense?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.600
Student: Yes.
 

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.325
Prof: Okay,
but I have to do that for every

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:11.394
single t,
so I have an infinite number of

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.658
prices and an infinite number of
equations.

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:16.759
But then you say to yourself,
"Well,

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:24.065
hmm, if I take the ratio of
p_t over

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:30.186
p_t-1,
to = p, then the ratio of these

00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:35.965
two prices is the same as this
price," and so I'll have

00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:40.080
one equation and one unknown
variable,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.158
and that same equation will get
repeated every other generation.

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:45.870
Because when I go to generation
s,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.854
which is another generation,
all that matters is the ratio

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:51.210
between p_t-1 and
p_t,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.830
and p_t and p_t
1.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.134
So if I assume those ratios are
always the same,

00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:03.264
I'm going to be repeating the
same equation over and over

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.178
again.
 

00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:06.251
So if I can solve it once,
I can solve it an infinite

00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:06.970
number of times.
 

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.546
It's basically the same
equation written infinitely

00:11:09.546 --> 00:11:11.698
often,
and so as long as I stick

00:11:11.698 --> 00:11:14.995
in--keep these ratios constant,
I'm just doing it over and over

00:11:14.995 --> 00:11:17.178
again,
so I only have to do it once.

00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:20.538
So it doesn't have to work out
that it's--it's just because

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:24.011
every generation has the same
endowments and every generation

00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:25.460
has the same utility.
 

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.889
That's why it's such a simple
thing to solve.

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.009
Yeah?
 

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:31.461
Student:
With the regular p,

00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:34.995
before you erased it,
is that a weight thrust that

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:38.240
becomes the old
&gt;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.658
because we assume young age
&gt;?

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:46.044
Prof: The p,
this p, is just the ratio

00:11:46.044 --> 00:11:48.428
between--this is how I got p.
 

00:11:48.428 --> 00:11:53.249
p_t--okay,
p is p_t over

00:11:53.249 --> 00:11:58.181
p_t-1,
which also = p_t 1

00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.759
over p_t.
 

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:03.740
The ratio of all the prices is
always p.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.370
The ratio between time t and
time t 1, this good is more

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.559
valuable than that good.
 

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:12.000
This good is only worth p.
 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.259
p is .55.
 

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:16.269
It's only worth 55 percent of
this good.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:20.048
And then this good here is only
worth 55 percent of that good.

00:12:20.048 --> 00:12:24.359
So the symmetry assumption,
the symmetry of the problem

00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:28.428
suggests that I could guess that
the prices are--

00:12:28.428 --> 00:12:36.548
the present value prices are
going to decline by the same

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:40.320
percentage every period.
 

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.639
Okay, any other questions?
 

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:42.409
We'll keep going with questions.
 

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:42.970
Yes?
 

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.000
Student:
Could you explain the e^(0) =

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.759
2,1, 1,1?
 

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:49.115
Prof: Yeah,
what is the endowment of the

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:50.090
original old guy?
 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.240
He's the guy who owns the land.
 

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.200
So what does he have?
 

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.232
He has one apple,
his endowment when he's old,

00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:58.389
like everybody else who's old.
 

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:01.177
He has an apple,
his own tree in his back yard

00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:03.408
gives him an apple when he's
old,

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.058
or when he's an old man or an
old woman,

00:13:06.058 --> 00:13:10.279
he can barely scrape together
one apple.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.278
Now he also has the land.
 

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:17.129
The land is his for all time,
so the land is paying an apple

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.500
every year forever.
 

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.835
So his own apple,
at time 1, plus the land's

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:25.480
apples is this 2,
and the land produces an apple

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.730
every time in the future.
 

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.629
So that's his endowment.
 

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:32.950
I stuck the dividends of the
land into his endowment.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.456
Student:
&gt;

00:13:35.456 --> 00:13:38.840
like he lives forever,
or &gt;?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.899
Prof: Right,
I'm not assuming he lives

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:40.139
forever.
 

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:40.908
He doesn't.
 

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:43.158
In fact, he knows he's going to
die in period 1.

00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.311
He wants to do all his
consuming in period 1,

00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:48.048
but he hasn't--that's another
subtle thing about this.

00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:53.870
You can own endowments that
occur after you're dead.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.147
If you own a tree,
the tree, the land is going to

00:13:57.147 --> 00:14:00.220
be producing stuff long after
you're dead,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.419
so when you sell off the land,
you're selling off those future

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.048
dividends.
 

00:14:04.048 --> 00:14:05.750
Of course, you're not going to
hold the land.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.230
If you don't care about your
children,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.860
you're not going to hold the
land beyond the time you live,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.019
because you want to just
consume as much as you can.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:15.226
So you're going to sell off the
land and consume,

00:14:15.226 --> 00:14:18.498
but you're selling off all
these future dividends,

00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:19.100
okay?
 

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:26.279
So another thing this model
gives us is a new argument for

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:33.210
the real interest rate,
real r, being greater than 0.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.450
So why is it?
 

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.619
Because from this
formula--gosh,

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:41.039
I was so clever.
 

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.490
Where did I--oh, here.
 

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.960
From the price of the asset,
this discounted dividends,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:51.710
that's going to be 1 over (1
r), 1 over (1 r) squared,

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.860
1 over (1 r) cubed,
..., by the way,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.870
that's = to p p squared p
cubed, you notice,

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.408
okay?
 

00:15:02.408 --> 00:15:09.168
So the discounted value of the
dividends is the price of land.

00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:11.730
So the price of land,
of course, has to be finite,

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.778
because if the old guy owned a
thing worth an infinite amount

00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:16.274
of money,
he'd sell it and he'd buy

00:15:16.274 --> 00:15:17.158
everything in the world.
 

00:15:17.158 --> 00:15:20.426
So if you're going to have
equilibrium, there's no plot of

00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:23.350
land that sells for 10,
for 100 trillion dollars.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.558
The price of every plot of land
is some finite amount.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:29.750
So if the land is producing,
I think it's sort of realistic.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.129
Land is probably going to
produce forever.

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:33.975
As long as the world lasts,
if you've got land,

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.298
you'll get something out of it.
 

00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:38.238
Someone will always want the
land, and so if it's going to

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:40.866
have a finite price,
the whole future dividends have

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:42.928
to be discounted to a finite
number.

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:46.178
If you put 0 in here for r,
you get infinity.

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:52.017
So this presence of land is
forcing the discount rate above

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:52.418
0.
 

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:54.991
So it's another argument that
Fisher never would have thought

00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:56.333
of,
because he never thought about

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:57.600
infinities or anything like
that--

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.080
another argument for the real
interest rate being positive.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.899
Okay, any other questions about
this?

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:17.880
So we reduce it to one
equation, and I'll put back the

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.889
p here in just one unknown.
 

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:25.299
Okay, = 5.
 

00:16:25.299 --> 00:16:29.470
And we saw that we get p = .55.
 

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.860
And it's a quadratic equation,
so you can all solve quadratic

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.940
equations.
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.690
Okay, what else do I want to
say?

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.250
So now you could analyze all
sorts of things.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.990
You could do the same
comparative statics Fisher does.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.075
Suppose we change the utility
function and made this 1 third

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:51.460
instead of 1 half.
 

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.750
That would correspond to doing
what?

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.360
Making people more?
 

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.990
More what?
 

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.950
Impatient, okay.
 

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.019
And what would you think would
happen to the interest rate?

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:06.680
Student: Go up.
 

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.380
Prof: Go up, okay.
 

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.990
So in the Excel file,
we're going to do just that.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.440
We're going to see it's going
to go up.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.009
Instead, we could do the Social
Security thing,

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:18.961
and we could have every young
person give something to the

00:17:18.961 --> 00:17:21.261
previous old,
which means everybody's

00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:24.078
endowment goes from say 3 to 2
and 1 to 2,

00:17:24.078 --> 00:17:27.328
so they get more in the future
and less early on.

00:17:27.328 --> 00:17:29.772
So again, you could re-solve
for equilibrium and Fisher's

00:17:29.772 --> 00:17:31.258
saying,
if you've got more endowment in

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:32.509
the future and less in the
present,

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:37.529
you're going to have a higher
real interest rate.

00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:39.288
So you get a higher real
interest rate.

00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:42.847
You could make the land more
productive and change this to a

00:17:42.847 --> 00:17:45.140
2 everywhere,
and see what happened.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.640
So in this Excel file,
I do that.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.920
Maybe I'll come back to that.
 

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.709
So we're going to do those
experiments in a second,

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:58.029
but now I want to do two more
things before I end this.

00:17:58.029 --> 00:18:01.076
The first is,
I want to say,

00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:05.480
suppose we had growth in the
economy.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.289
So what if you had growth?
 

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:09.309
Where am I going to add growth?
 

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:09.910
Over here.
 

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.240
I shouldn't have erased that.
 

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.099
So let's have growth.
 

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:20.880
What happens?
 

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.259
Well, Tobin,
you know, Yale's greatest

00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:27.118
economist after Irving Fisher,
he said something which was 90

00:18:27.118 --> 00:18:29.950
percent right but not 100
percent right.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.211
He said, you know,
I pointed out to him that I got

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:33.690
these guys at Social Security.
 

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.980
I worked with them.
 

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.224
Anyway, these people at Social
Security and the Social Security

00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:41.313
Administration calculated who
were the biggest beneficiaries

00:18:41.313 --> 00:18:44.632
of Social Security,
and it was Tobin's generation,

00:18:44.632 --> 00:18:46.970
the same generation as my
father.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.864
And I said, "Look,
it's your fault that Social

00:18:48.864 --> 00:18:49.848
Security is such a mess.
 

00:18:49.848 --> 00:18:53.108
You benefited and I'm going to
have to pay for it."

00:18:53.108 --> 00:18:56.188
And just like you're feeling
you're going to have to pay for

00:18:56.188 --> 00:18:57.910
it, so it's even worse for you.
 

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.288
But even my generation's not
getting a very good deal.

00:19:00.288 --> 00:19:03.288
Yours is getting a terrible
deal, Tobin's got a great deal.

00:19:03.288 --> 00:19:05.748
And so he said to me,
it's not his fault,

00:19:05.748 --> 00:19:08.329
it's my fault,
because I didn't have enough

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.130
children.
 

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.502
So the question is,
what happens if you--what does

00:19:12.502 --> 00:19:13.328
that mean?
 

00:19:13.328 --> 00:19:18.752
So what Tobin meant is that if,
instead of having 1 child for

00:19:18.752 --> 00:19:21.213
every adult--
so every family has 2 children,

00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:23.646
in other words,
instead of 1 child for every

00:19:23.646 --> 00:19:25.383
adult,
so it goes 3,1,

00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:29.640
3,1, 3,1, we start doubling--
the generations are growing

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.588
through time.
 

00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:33.213
So since this is 30 years or
something, we could think of the

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:34.220
generations doubling.
 

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.180
That wouldn't be such a fast
growth rate.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.817
And so Tobin might have meant,
if you double the generations,

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:44.529
you're going to have 6 and 2 as
the endowment.

00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:47.259
2 guys at 3 and 1,
which means 6 and 2.

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:48.868
Then you're going to have 12
and 4.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:51.348
It's going to be a gigantic
growth,

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:54.660
and so each generation,
when it's old,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.450
the young guys,
if there's 6 and 2 here now--

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.048
I should use a different color.
 

00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:09.548
If I wrote 6 and 2 here,
then each guy would have to--

00:20:09.548 --> 00:20:18.266
or 2 guys at 3 and 1,
each (3,1) guy would only have

00:20:18.266 --> 00:20:23.923
to give up half a unit,
because there'd be 2 of them

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:25.660
each giving half a unit to the
old guy.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.759
And each one,
when he gets old,

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.298
getting a full unit.
 

00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:30.970
So this guy would get a full
unit.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.298
The next generation would only
give up half a unit,

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.500
and because there were 4 times
as many people in the next

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.664
generation,
each of them would still give 1

00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:39.839
half,
making these 2 old guys get

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:40.779
their full 1.
 

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:43.259
And when they got old,
they'd similarly get a full 1

00:20:43.259 --> 00:20:43.990
each of them.
 

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.150
So it would seem that if you
had a faster growing population,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.308
then Social Security would be a
much better deal,

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:53.088
because the young would have to
give up less to the old and

00:20:53.088 --> 00:20:55.390
still get fully paid back when
they were old,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.140
and so Social Security wouldn't
have been a problem.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.567
Ok, so why wasn't it our fault,
my fault--and your generation

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:06.553
is probably not going to have
any more children than my

00:21:06.553 --> 00:21:07.660
generation.
 

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.528
Is that true, Tobin's argument?
 

00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:13.734
Is it true that if we just had
enough children,

00:21:13.734 --> 00:21:16.180
no one would have to lose out
in Social Security?

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.223
We could make the original
generation better off and also

00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:21.779
every other generation after
that better off?

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:22.190
Yeah?
 

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.032
Student:
&gt;

00:21:26.032 --> 00:21:29.492
even giving up half to get 1
wouldn't

00:21:29.492 --> 00:21:32.279
&gt;
 

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:34.140
Prof: Right, exactly.
 

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.664
And so you can't know that
until you actually solve the

00:21:36.664 --> 00:21:37.038
model.
 

00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:39.707
So the point is,
that if the generations keep

00:21:39.707 --> 00:21:43.409
growing like that,
the interest rate is going to

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:45.914
go up,
and so it's still going to be a

00:21:45.914 --> 00:21:48.277
loss,
because although you're going

00:21:48.277 --> 00:21:50.828
to be trading off - 1 half to
get 1,

00:21:50.828 --> 00:21:54.731
as opposed to - 1 to get 1--so
this looks like a much better

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:55.460
scenario.
 

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.132
Once you get to this scenario,
there's going to be a bigger

00:21:58.132 --> 00:21:58.868
interest rate.
 

00:21:58.868 --> 00:22:02.682
So remember,
the present value of that trade

00:22:02.682 --> 00:22:04.808
is - 1 (1 over (1 r)).
 

00:22:04.808 --> 00:22:06.970
That's why it's negative,
because r is positive.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:16.058
Here it's - 1 half (1 over (1
r)), but that's a different r.

00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:17.847
That's an r,
I'll put it at the top,

00:22:17.847 --> 00:22:19.993
that's in a new economy,
a growing economy,

00:22:19.993 --> 00:22:22.088
and that r is going to be a
bigger r.

00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:24.538
So even though it's - 1 half
instead of 1,

00:22:24.538 --> 00:22:27.943
this thing's going to be small
enough, so you still end up

00:22:27.943 --> 00:22:28.960
losing money.
 

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.460
But you'd never know that
unless you solved it.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.269
And in fact,
it's still going to depend on a

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:34.490
little delicate assumption.
 

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.778
So Tobin, by the way,
never bothered to work this

00:22:37.778 --> 00:22:38.190
out.
 

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.592
I claim that if you're going to
be doubling the population like

00:22:43.592 --> 00:22:45.498
this,
there are going to be a lot

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:48.596
more people working on the land,
and so the dividends of the

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:51.519
land are probably going to grow
at the same rate.

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:54.900
So I would add a 2 here.
 

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.479
I'd make the dividends of the
land also double,

00:22:57.479 --> 00:22:59.048
if the population doubled.
 

00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:02.058
So the land dividends are going
to grow.

00:23:02.058 --> 00:23:05.838
Now you can see why the
interest rate has to go up,

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:09.299
because the present value of
the land still has to be a

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.710
finite number,
the present discounted value of

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.348
the dividends.
 

00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:14.602
And if the dividends are
growing, then the interest rate

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:16.895
had better be growing even
faster if you're going to make

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.920
that a finite number.
 

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.590
So sure enough,
when you solve it,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.869
you're going to get a higher
interest rate.

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.759
So how would you solve it?
 

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:35.357
Let's say the growth rate is g,
so every generation is 1 g

00:23:35.357 --> 00:23:42.608
times bigger the previous
generation.

00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:46.980
So you could just change this
equation very simply.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.328
What would you do?
 

00:23:49.328 --> 00:23:54.523
Well, for any generation,
it's the same equation,

00:23:54.523 --> 00:24:00.474
except that you've got 1 g
times as many old guys as you

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:03.828
have--these are young guys.
 

00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:07.509
The number of young guys is 1 g
times the number of old guys.

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:14.313
So if it's generation t,
time t, this would be (1 g) to

00:24:14.313 --> 00:24:22.250
the (t - 1), and this would get
multiplied by (1 g) to the t.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.580
And the dividend,
5, so everybody's endowment is

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.565
also going up,
so it would be--actually I

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:27.308
screwed up.
 

00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:33.752
It would be,
the old guy's 1 times (1 g) to

00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:40.656
the (t-1) the young guys times
(1 g) to the t,

00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:49.710
the dividend times (1 g) to the
t, or t - 1, whichever.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.279
Okay, so that's the new
equation.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:55.578
You can divide through by (1 g)
to the (t - 1).

00:24:55.578 --> 00:25:01.130
So this is period t's market
clearing equation,

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.224
but you can see I
haven't--because the number of

00:25:03.224 --> 00:25:05.515
old guys,
for each one of them that's

00:25:05.515 --> 00:25:08.549
behaving like that,
but there are now this many of

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:10.509
them,
and the young guys are behaving

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.450
just as before,
but there are this many of

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.048
them, more of them.
 

00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:17.578
And then the endowments of the
old have been grown that far,

00:25:17.578 --> 00:25:19.980
you know, the old generation
has this many endowments.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.522
The young has this much
endowments when young,

00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:24.838
and then the land we also
assumed grew.

00:25:24.838 --> 00:25:28.498
Okay, so now you can just
divide through by (1 g) to the

00:25:28.498 --> 00:25:30.948
(t - 1),
and that goes away,

00:25:30.948 --> 00:25:35.117
and that just leaves that,
and that goes away,

00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:37.970
and that goes away,
and that goes away.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.328
So you'd have that equation.
 

00:25:39.328 --> 00:25:40.700
Student:
Can you do that again?

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.269
Prof: Oh no, yes.
 

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:46.680
I was afraid someone was going
to do that.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:58.400
So let's just see where I got
this equation from.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.681
So I took my original equation,
which didn't have any 1 gs in

00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:03.766
it,
and I just said,

00:26:03.766 --> 00:26:06.738
if I had growth in the economy,
it's no big deal to take that

00:26:06.738 --> 00:26:07.519
into account.
 

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:10.259
I'm still going to have 1
equation, so I can still solve

00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:10.509
it.
 

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:15.068
It's just that at every time t,
how many old guys do I have?

00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:19.248
I have each old guy behaving
the same way as before,

00:26:19.248 --> 00:26:23.098
except that now there's been a
growth of 1 g.

00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:26.983
This is a generation before
this one, so this generation is

00:26:26.983 --> 00:26:29.058
of size (1 g) to the (t - 1).
 

00:26:29.058 --> 00:26:31.867
The young generation,
which was 1 generation ahead,

00:26:31.867 --> 00:26:33.608
has grown by a factor of 1 g.
 

00:26:33.608 --> 00:26:36.450
So there's (1 g) to the t of
these guys.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.890
So I take their old demand,
you know,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.608
the same for each guy,
but different number of guys,

00:26:41.608 --> 00:26:44.657
and the young generation's
demand, and I have to set it =

00:26:44.657 --> 00:26:45.529
to the supply.
 

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:47.630
But that's just the old guy's
endowment,

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.242
so 1 for each old guy,
and there are that many old

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:52.349
guys,
the young guys' endowment,

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:56.048
same as before,
and there are that many of

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.005
them, the land,
which I've also assumed has

00:26:59.005 --> 00:27:01.210
been doubling,
1 g is 2.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.440
So the land is also doubling.
 

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.686
And I'm not sure whether I
called this t or t - 1,

00:27:07.686 --> 00:27:10.538
but either one,
it's not going to make a big

00:27:10.538 --> 00:27:11.930
difference, okay?
 

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.559
Who asked the question?
 

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:14.950
You follow that, right?
 

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.000
I've got 1 gs everywhere,
so I can cancel a lot of them

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.450
out.
 

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.500
That's all I did.
 

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.513
So if I divide by (1 g) to the
(t - 1), I just get rid of the

00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.519
(1 g) to the (t - 1)s.
 

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:31.009
I change (1 g) to the t divided
by (1 g) to the (t - 1).

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:32.549
That's just to the first power.
 

00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:34.190
I got rid of this one.
 

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.346
I made this to the first power,
and this to the first power,

00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:38.838
okay?
 

00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:45.948
So I can solve that perfectly
easily and I'll do that in Excel

00:27:45.948 --> 00:27:47.578
in a second.
 

00:27:47.578 --> 00:27:50.170
And then we can see what
happens to everybody's utility.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:59.880
So any questions about what I
did here?

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.910
Yes.
 

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.450
Student:
&gt;

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.103
Prof: Yeah,
it's going to change the

00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:09.230
answer, but it's going to
qualitatively be the same.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:15.048
Student:
&gt;

00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:16.730
Prof: Well,
it depends whether when I do

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.329
this I want to say this is 2,
4,8, 16 or whether I want to

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:22.240
call it 1,2, 4,8,
16.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.970
So I don't know which is the
right thing.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.180
Probably I should have done
1,2, 4,8.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:35.019
Probably the way I have it here
which is t - 1.

00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:41.048
Okay, any other questions about
this?

00:28:41.048 --> 00:28:45.297
So the last thing to do is to
just do it numerically,

00:28:45.297 --> 00:28:49.544
because it's a pain to have to
solve these, you know,

00:28:49.544 --> 00:28:51.750
these quadratic things.
 

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:59.709
It's only 1 equation,
but it's still a pain to solve,

00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:08.894
and I happen to have written a
file that you can use to solve

00:29:08.894 --> 00:29:13.180
these all automatically.
 

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:25.028
This doesn't look too good.
 

00:29:25.028 --> 00:29:27.410
So the first one,
the first case I did,

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.980
suppose A, that's the exponent
for how patient you are.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.161
That's half,
that's the first exponent,

00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:35.250
half, half.
 

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:40.308
So I always can make the log
utilities, the 2 coefficients,

00:29:40.308 --> 00:29:41.880
so it's A log B.
 

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:50.269
So I'm assuming utility here,
U of young and old is A log

00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:55.961
young (1 - A) log old,
old consumption,

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:57.309
okay?
 

00:29:57.309 --> 00:29:59.618
So A I took to be 1 half.
 

00:29:59.618 --> 00:30:01.548
That's just what we were
figuring out.

00:30:01.548 --> 00:30:04.673
I took the endowments when
young to be 3 and when old to be

00:30:04.673 --> 00:30:06.828
1 and the land output to be 1
forever.

00:30:06.828 --> 00:30:10.269
Then the price is what I'm
going to try and solve for,

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:15.270
and so I solved the market
clearing equation and cleared it

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.410
and did Excel solver and got the
consumption,

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:27.147
which we figured out was 1.775
when young and when old was

00:30:27.147 --> 00:30:29.125
3.225,
which adds up,

00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:31.230
the two of them add up to 5
together,

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.440
just as we thought.
 

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.838
And so I even calculated the
utility of each of the people.

00:30:36.838 --> 00:30:40.807
I didn't do log utility,
actually, I wrote a monotonic

00:30:40.807 --> 00:30:42.078
transformation.
 

00:30:42.078 --> 00:30:44.650
I put Y to the A,
Z to the (1 - A).

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.740
It's easier for me,
you get positive numbers.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.730
That's e to the U.
 

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.730
So I might as well describe
utility as the exponent of U.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.250
Take e to it,
so it's a positive number.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.824
When you do logs of small
numbers, you get negatives,

00:30:58.824 --> 00:31:00.309
so that's easier to look at.
 

00:31:00.309 --> 00:31:02.858
So that's the utility.
 

00:31:02.858 --> 00:31:07.240
Okay, now we can do Social
Security.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.578
What happens with Social
Security?

00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:10.519
The only effect of Social
Security, remember,

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:11.490
it's the same model.
 

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.095
You just take stuff away from
the young and give it to the

00:31:14.095 --> 00:31:14.368
old.
 

00:31:14.368 --> 00:31:17.441
So nothing changes,
except the young's endowment

00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:20.970
goes down to 2 and the old's
endowment goes up to 2.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.618
And then the rest of the
model's exactly the same.

00:31:23.618 --> 00:31:24.980
And so, of course,
it's going to give you a

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.498
different price.
 

00:31:25.498 --> 00:31:26.470
p_A is different.
 

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.298
So p_A is smaller.
 

00:31:28.298 --> 00:31:31.529
That means today's price of
next year's good is smaller.

00:31:31.529 --> 00:31:33.548
There must be more discounting.
 

00:31:33.548 --> 00:31:38.551
So I did the interest rate,
1 over 1 r = p,

00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:42.838
so the inverse of p is this
thing.

00:31:42.838 --> 00:31:46.865
So the forward rate is 161
percent, and if you think of

00:31:46.865 --> 00:31:49.921
that as 30 years,
that's an annualized 3.2

00:31:49.921 --> 00:31:51.858
percent interest rate.
 

00:31:51.858 --> 00:31:54.625
Before, it was only a 2 percent
interest rate annualized,

00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:55.019
right?
 

00:31:55.019 --> 00:32:00.638
Remember we got the 1 r to be
181 percent, 1.81,

00:32:00.638 --> 00:32:03.150
so r is 81 percent.
 

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.450
So this Social Security doubled
the interest rate from 81

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.368
percent to 161 percent.
 

00:32:09.368 --> 00:32:12.410
Huge increase in the interest
rate, so Social Security has

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.848
raised the interest rate.
 

00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:18.691
And so you re-solve the whole
equilibrium and it didn't crush

00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:23.371
everybody, but everybody's
utility went down except for the

00:32:23.371 --> 00:32:25.470
very first generation.
 

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.108
We know they won for free.
 

00:32:29.108 --> 00:32:33.078
But now I could do the same
thing with growth.

00:32:33.078 --> 00:32:37.278
I could just solve that
equation on the left,

00:32:37.278 --> 00:32:42.430
and so I plug in now the growth
rate from generation to

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.818
generation, 1 growth,
and here I've got 2.

00:32:46.818 --> 00:32:49.358
So it doubles every period,
just the example I did,

00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:51.815
and so I solve it and you see
that of course from the

00:32:51.815 --> 00:32:54.742
generations growing and land is
being more productive and there

00:32:54.742 --> 00:32:56.680
are more apples and stuff like
that,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.509
there's just more for everybody
to consume.

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:02.019
It's actually made everybody
better off.

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:07.144
But now we see that Tobin and
the interest rate is higher,

00:33:07.144 --> 00:33:11.548
way higher, 247 percent instead
of 161 percent.

00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:15.828
If I do now Social Security in
the growing economy,

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:20.867
every generation when young
only has to give up half an

00:33:20.867 --> 00:33:24.598
apple and get 1 whole apple when
old,

00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.798
so that raises the interest
rate from 247 percent to 300

00:33:30.798 --> 00:33:34.689
percent,
annualized from 4 percent to

00:33:34.689 --> 00:33:35.920
4.7 percent.
 

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.317
So the rate of growth is faster
now than the growth of the

00:33:40.317 --> 00:33:41.630
economy, right?
 

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.121
This interest rate,
300 percent is faster than the

00:33:45.121 --> 00:33:47.900
rate of growth,
which is 100 percent.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.298
So again, everybody is going to
lose.

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:53.670
They're going to go from
3.06--they're still going to

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.630
lose by Social Security,
to go down to 3.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.608
But Tobin, I would say,
is 90 percent right,

00:33:58.608 --> 00:34:02.125
although more children doesn't
solve the Social Security

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:04.461
problem,
because it's going to increase

00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:05.660
the rate of interest.
 

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.578
So you're still going to have
losers.

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:10.518
Nonetheless,
the loss is now much smaller

00:34:10.518 --> 00:34:13.679
with lots of children than it
was before.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.929
So Tobin, I would say,
is 90 percent right.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.322
If only every generation would
have more children,

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.960
we still would have had a
crisis in Social Security.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.132
We still would have had this
every generation complaining it

00:34:25.132 --> 00:34:28.882
was getting a bad deal,
but it would be a lot less bad

00:34:28.882 --> 00:34:30.510
than it was before.
 

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.733
And then I did this variant,
depending on what we said,

00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:39.661
whether the growth was--whether
I had a g to the t or a g to the

00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:41.070
(t - 1) there.
 

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.690
It doesn't really change that
much.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.000
Okay, so that's it.
 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.358
So you see, just by a very
simple modification of the

00:34:47.358 --> 00:34:49.820
problem,
you can resolve--it's just

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.568
understanding is,
at least in my mind,

00:34:52.568 --> 00:34:56.239
so much clearer now about what
role growth plays.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.639
Having more children doesn't
make the problem go away.

00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:01.059
It makes it better,
but you can never make it go

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:04.096
away, because the interest rate
is always going to be higher

00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:06.309
than the rate of growth of the
economy.

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:14.750
So let's do one last experiment
on this stuff.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.679
Another problem to resolve.
 

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:24.563
I wrote a paper,
the newspapers were saying the

00:35:24.563 --> 00:35:35.360
same sorts of things and I'll
tell you what they were saying.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.610
Oh no, I did a mistake.
 

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:48.670
Sorry.
 

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:53.043
Okay, so remember those
pictures that we showed before

00:35:53.043 --> 00:35:54.860
of the stock market.
 

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.150
If you take out inflation,
the stock market seems to go in

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.500
these waves where prices go up
and then they come down,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.293
then prices go up,
then they come down and prices

00:36:03.293 --> 00:36:04.590
go up,
then they come down.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.891
We've had 5 big waves of stock
markets going up and coming

00:36:08.891 --> 00:36:09.420
down.
 

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.340
We're now in a period where
they've been coming down.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.400
The stock market is lower now
than it was 10 years ago,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.929
correcting for inflation.
 

00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:17.949
In fact, even not correcting
for inflation.

00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:20.800
So why would you expect that to
happen?

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.579
Is there any logic to that?
 

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:25.449
So here's an old picture of the
stock market.

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:28.190
I wrote this paper in 2005.
 

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.360
Remember at the first class,
we had a picture like that.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.809
You can see the stock market
going up and down,

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:34.088
up and down,
up and down,

00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:35.579
up and down,
five waves.

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:36.880
It's now come down further.
 

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.480
This is like 2001 or '02,
so it's come down way further

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.280
than that.
 

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:49.030
So is there any explanation for
why that would happen?

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.527
So here's an explanation I gave
in a paper, which a lot of

00:36:52.527 --> 00:36:54.920
people in the newspapers were
giving.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.739
I said, the baby boomers.
 

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:01.789
I said all these baby boomers
like me, we're getting old.

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:04.300
We're going to start selling
our stocks and so the stock

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.579
market's going to go down.
 

00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:09.239
And so that's what newspapers
were saying too.

00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:11.985
The difference is,
that the economists criticized

00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:14.844
the newspapers and me and they
say, "Oh you're

00:37:14.844 --> 00:37:16.389
crazy," they said.
 

00:37:16.389 --> 00:37:18.784
"The stock market,
it can't be that the stock

00:37:18.784 --> 00:37:21.094
market is going to go down,
and everybody knows it's going

00:37:21.094 --> 00:37:22.608
to go down,
because if we knew it was going

00:37:22.608 --> 00:37:29.130
to go down in the future,
it would have already gone down

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.090
now."
 

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.139
Okay, so you have to give an
argument.

00:37:33.139 --> 00:37:38.164
So what I pointed out was that
if you look at the history of

00:37:38.164 --> 00:37:41.400
live births, you get the same
cycle.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.969
Look, it went up and down,
up and down.

00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:45.989
I don't know if you can read
that.

00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:47.159
I can hardly read it myself.
 

00:37:47.159 --> 00:37:48.090
What years are these?
 

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:53.219
Why is it so unreadable?
 

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:56.110
Let's just see if I blow it up
a little bit.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.030
Now I can see it.
 

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.367
This is 1910,
'20, '30, '40,

00:38:01.367 --> 00:38:05.199
'50, '60, '70,
'80, '90,2000.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.018
You can see these were live
births.

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:10.626
So births, there a baby boom
and then a plummet,

00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:12.929
then another huge baby boom.
 

00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:15.389
That's the famous baby boom,
my baby boom,

00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:16.650
and then a plummet.
 

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.119
And then there was another baby
boom.

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:20.474
I forget what they call it,
the X generation or whatever it

00:38:20.474 --> 00:38:22.139
is, some other baby boom that
happened.

00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:25.135
Basically my baby boomers,
me having children,

00:38:25.135 --> 00:38:28.929
another big baby boom and then
birth rates are going to go

00:38:28.929 --> 00:38:29.530
down.
 

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.717
So I think that you are--the
number of 18 year olds in the

00:38:33.717 --> 00:38:37.914
country is at its all time high,
or is going to be in two years

00:38:37.914 --> 00:38:40.300
when my poor son tries to get
into college.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.699
And so then it's going to go
down again.

00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:47.737
So this is a cyclical thing
that keeps happening over and

00:38:47.737 --> 00:38:50.550
over again with baby booms and
busts.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.842
And everybody knows about the
baby boom after the war,

00:38:53.842 --> 00:38:56.449
my generation,
the '50s and '60s when I was

00:38:56.449 --> 00:38:57.010
born.
 

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.405
Everybody knows about that,
but they don't realize that

00:38:59.405 --> 00:39:01.802
there's been baby boom after
baby boom after baby boom,

00:39:01.802 --> 00:39:03.489
and this is a cyclical
phenomenon.

00:39:03.489 --> 00:39:07.034
And then the thing that they
really don't know is that it's

00:39:07.034 --> 00:39:09.480
exactly the same as the stock
market,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.989
that those 5 patterns in the
stock market were the same

00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:16.329
patterns of the baby boom.
 

00:39:16.329 --> 00:39:21.550
Okay, so I'm going to end with
that picture.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.362
Okay, so a picture is worth a
thousand words,

00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:25.012
but it's not that compelling an
argument.

00:39:25.012 --> 00:39:26.619
You need a little bit of
analytics.

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:29.619
Suppose everybody knew that
generations were going to get

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:32.780
bigger and then smaller and then
bigger and then smaller.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.496
Would the stock market go up
and then down and then up and

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:38.023
then down, as I was saying,
and as all these newspaper

00:39:38.023 --> 00:39:39.309
columnists were saying?
 

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:43.809
Or would it just stay the same,
as these less imaginative

00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:48.146
economist critiquers were
saying, that it couldn't have

00:39:48.146 --> 00:39:50.960
anything to do with demography?
 

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.170
Because by rationality,
people would look forward and

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.806
they'd anticipate it going down,
so they'd all sell before it

00:39:55.806 --> 00:39:57.579
went down,
so it would never go down.

00:39:57.579 --> 00:40:01.090
So it turns out that it does go
up and down,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.311
and that argument the
economists gave doesn't make any

00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:06.224
sense,
because they were implicitly

00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:08.806
assuming that the rate of
interest stayed the same the

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:09.489
whole time.
 

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:12.045
And if the rate of interest
doesn't stay the same,

00:40:12.045 --> 00:40:15.070
then there's no reason why the
stock market has to stay the

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:15.539
same.
 

00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:21.452
So let's go back to where we
were before and change the model

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:22.929
a little bit.
 

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:30.021
Let's suppose that the model is
an alternation between big

00:40:30.021 --> 00:40:34.500
generations and small
generations.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:41.231
So let's suppose that you have
(6,2), (3,1),

00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:43.110
and (6,2).
 

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.619
I think I kept--so it's a good
question.

00:40:45.619 --> 00:40:47.070
What should I do with land?
 

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.559
I think I kept it at 1 every
period.

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:54.699
God, I hope that wasn't the key
to the result.

00:40:54.699 --> 00:40:57.083
So in the paper,
of course, I had,

00:40:57.083 --> 00:41:00.983
you know, people living 80
years and I had their income

00:41:00.983 --> 00:41:05.389
reflecting the sort of trend in
income over the lifetime.

00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:10.693
But anyway, for the purposes of
this class, let's say there's a

00:41:10.693 --> 00:41:14.800
small generation where it goes
young 3, old 1.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.096
Then the next generation,
which is just 2 guys,

00:41:17.096 --> 00:41:19.242
so they're both (3,1) guys,
so in aggregate,

00:41:19.242 --> 00:41:20.739
they're going to be (6,2).
 

00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:24.155
The next generation's (3,1),
the next generation's (6,2),

00:41:24.155 --> 00:41:27.876
the next generation's (3,1) and
it keeps alternating like that

00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:28.610
forever.
 

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.889
Now, how would you solve for
equilibrium?

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:34.090
Does the whole thing just get
much more complicated?

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.150
I mean, what happens, after all?
 

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.360
Any questions here about what
we're doing?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.750
So it looks way more
complicated, but it's not.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.750
It's a little bit more
complicated, but not much.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:49.630
You can still solve for this.
 

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.887
So I'm going to not spend too
much time on this,

00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:54.340
but I'm just going to show you
what you would do.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.929
So what would you do?
 

00:41:55.929 --> 00:42:01.773
Well, by symmetry,
I claim, you can guess that

00:42:01.773 --> 00:42:06.320
there are going to be two
prices.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.681
So you notice that every
generation only cares about the

00:42:09.681 --> 00:42:12.800
relative price when it's young
and when it's old.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.750
So there's this relative price.
 

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.768
That relative price between
consumption at time 1 and time

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:20.840
2, that's going to affect the
generation born at time 1.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.929
It actually has no effect on
any other generation.

00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:26.795
These generations are born
after that, so this interest

00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:29.447
rate, this relative price
between these two periods

00:42:29.447 --> 00:42:31.039
affects only 1 generation.
 

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:35.449
So this generation is affected
by the interest rate between

00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:36.969
time 2 and time 3.
 

00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:42.467
This generation is affected by
the interest rate at time 3 and

00:42:42.467 --> 00:42:43.280
time 4.
 

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.608
Every generation is responding
to the interest rates during its

00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:50.750
life, not during another
generation's life.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.530
So by symmetry,
I think, you can guess--

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.637
and it turns out to be
true--that there's going to be a

00:42:55.637 --> 00:43:00.610
price,
a relative price--I should call

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:05.992
them small--
for the small generation,

00:43:05.992 --> 00:43:12.190
and a relative price for the
big generation.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.050
The same thing is going to
happen.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.695
So this relative price will be
p_small,

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.050
this will be p_big.
 

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.911
Then we'll get
p_small again here,

00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:25.840
and p_big connecting
these guys.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.101
And it's just going to keep
repeating itself over and over

00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:28.420
again.
 

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.217
And by symmetry,
you could guess that the

00:43:32.217 --> 00:43:35.539
equilibrium would look like
that.

00:43:35.539 --> 00:43:39.269
Is this making sense?
 

00:43:39.269 --> 00:43:40.170
It's not making sense.
 

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.360
Is it making sense?
 

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:49.409
So what would I have to check
to see that there's equilibrium?

00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:53.539
Let's do it over here.
 

00:43:53.539 --> 00:44:02.739
Let's do a small generation.
 

00:44:02.739 --> 00:44:04.360
Okay, so we never did the first.
 

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.155
So the first generation,
it depends whether we start

00:44:07.155 --> 00:44:08.909
with a small one or a big one.
 

00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:12.123
But remember,
if we can clear all the markets

00:44:12.123 --> 00:44:14.827
for all time,
except the first market,

00:44:14.827 --> 00:44:17.750
that one has to automatically
clear.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.460
That was Walras' insight.
 

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.250
So we know that if we can clear
all these,

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.090
the first one's going to look
very different,

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.681
but it's going to clear anyway,
so I don't really have to worry

00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:28.320
about it.
 

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.820
So we'll see why that works.
 

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.862
So I'm going to now talk about
market clearing at any time,

00:44:34.862 --> 00:44:38.349
except the first one,
which is more complicated.

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:40.938
The first one seems really
complicated because there's this

00:44:40.938 --> 00:44:43.260
guy 0 who owns these dividends
that go on forever.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.010
But of course,
they're just worth the price of

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.449
land, which he's going to sell
off.

00:44:46.449 --> 00:44:48.730
But anyway, we'll come back to
that in a second.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:54.405
So in every generation,
every time period,

00:44:54.405 --> 00:45:01.329
when small generation is young,
what do you get?

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:04.739
What's the market clearing
equation going to be?

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:09.376
Well, the small generation is
going to be young,

00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:13.518
so that means the old
generation is big.

00:45:13.518 --> 00:45:17.134
Sorry, it's a half-year,
so the big old guys,

00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:20.010
their endowment is going to be
6.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.630
There's 2 of them,
so I can put the 2 out here.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:33.739
3 1 p_big,
divided by p_big,

00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:41.050
that's the big old generation
and the young generation,

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:46.440
they're the usual 3 1
p_young,

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.518
divided by 1.
 

00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:53.829
A has to = now,
how many endowments do we have?

00:45:53.829 --> 00:46:01.599
We've got 2 old guys each
owning 1, so that's 2 times 1.

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:05.143
That's their endowment,
3, that's the young guys,

00:46:05.143 --> 00:46:06.619
the land dividend.
 

00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:08.639
So that's 6.
 

00:46:08.639 --> 00:46:10.824
Student:
If you divide the second

00:46:10.824 --> 00:46:12.224
&gt;
 

00:46:12.224 --> 00:46:12.730
small?
 

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.532
Prof: So this should be
p_small,

00:46:14.532 --> 00:46:15.360
not p_young.
 

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.150
p_small.
 

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.786
No, I don't,
because the old guys--the big

00:46:19.786 --> 00:46:21.559
generation is old.
 

00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:22.960
The small generation is young.
 

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.826
So the young generation,
they're consuming in their

00:46:25.826 --> 00:46:28.750
youth now, so they're looking at
their endowment.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.550
The price when they're young is
1.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.940
So their young endowment is 3,
their old endowment--

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.688
their income's 3 times the
price to them of 1 when they're

00:46:36.688 --> 00:46:38.797
young,
plus the endowment of 1 when

00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:40.860
they're old times
p_small,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.150
divided by the price when
they're young,

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.840
which they're thinking of as 1,
right?

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.322
They only care about the
relative price between young and

00:46:46.322 --> 00:46:46.590
old.
 

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:50.420
That relative price is
determined by p_small.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.668
So I could call it
p_t and p_t

00:46:52.668 --> 00:46:54.969
1, but I know that ratio
is going to be

00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:56.119
p_small.
 

00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:59.014
So really, it only depends on
the ratio, so I might as well

00:46:59.014 --> 00:47:01.010
just use the ratio,
p_small.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.094
This is a crucial idea that
I've used 100 times and I

00:47:04.094 --> 00:47:06.452
think--
I've used it now 3 or 4 times

00:47:06.452 --> 00:47:08.170
anyway--
so, but I think some of you

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.300
don't quite know what the hell
I'm talking about.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.346
So somebody ask me a question
if they don't know why this is

00:47:13.346 --> 00:47:13.760
right.
 

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.072
Whoever just asked it,
maybe you still don't know why

00:47:16.072 --> 00:47:16.650
it's right.
 

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.909
Who asked this question a
minute ago?

00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:20.619
Yes.
 

00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:22.420
Do you understand how I got
this?

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.230
You do.
 

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.971
Okay, but when the old
guys--see, the old guys,

00:47:25.971 --> 00:47:29.190
which is the big generation,
we're clearing time--we're

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.679
looking at this time.
 

00:47:30.679 --> 00:47:33.880
So the total endowment is 3 for
the young generation.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.469
Their endowment is 2,
and the 1 unit of land.

00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:40.869
That's where I got the total
supply of 6.

00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:42.550
So this generation when it's
young,

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.719
they care about the
p_small,

00:47:44.719 --> 00:47:46.739
the relative price between here
and here,

00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:50.010
and so they're looking at
p_small,

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.980
the relative price of 1 to
p_small.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.798
The old generation at the same
time is looking over their

00:47:54.798 --> 00:47:57.266
lifetime at the ratio of
consumption here to here,

00:47:57.266 --> 00:47:59.179
which is given by
p_big.

00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:01.505
So they've got a
p_big here,

00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:04.835
and they're consuming when old,
so they're dividing by

00:48:04.835 --> 00:48:06.469
p_big,
okay?

00:48:06.469 --> 00:48:16.570
But now we've got a second
equation, which is when the big

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.469
generation is young.
 

00:48:20.469 --> 00:48:24.329
So why don't you tell me what
that equation's going to be?

00:48:24.329 --> 00:48:29.070
How much is the endowment when
the big generation is young?

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.750
That's, maybe,
clearing it this time.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:37.860
Here the big generation is
young, so what's the endowment?

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.195
It's going to be the young--so
the old, there's only going to

00:48:41.195 --> 00:48:42.030
be 1 old guy.
 

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:49.170
There are going to be 2 young
guys, each have endowment of 3,1

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.449
unit of land,
so that's 8.

00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:58.409
You can see that adds up to 6 1
1 is 8.

00:48:58.409 --> 00:48:59.880
Okay, and what's their demand?
 

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.840
What's the demand for the 2--so
there's the old.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.268
What are the old going to be
doing here?

00:49:07.268 --> 00:49:10.980
It's in this generation we're
doing the market clearing.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.650
Somebody knows how to answer
this.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.320
Yeah.
 

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:22.090
Student:
&gt;

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.585
Prof: :
Over here, the young,

00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.639
the small generation only has 1
when it's old.

00:49:25.639 --> 00:49:27.349
Student: Big generation.
 

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:28.135
Prof: :
But big generation,

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:28.590
that's over here.
 

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.894
We're clearing at this time
period, so there's a bunch of

00:49:32.894 --> 00:49:35.739
young guys and just a few old
guys.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:38.320
So the endowments are 6 1 1.
 

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:47.021
The time is going that way,
so that's why that's an 8 over

00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:48.090
here.
 

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.750
So if this is the 1 old guy's
endowment, 2 young guys who have

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.389
3 each, that's endowment of 6,
the land is 1,

00:49:54.389 --> 00:49:55.409
so you get 8.
 

00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:57.030
That's how I got an 8 over
there.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:58.119
That's the supply.
 

00:49:58.119 --> 00:49:59.019
So what's the demand?
 

00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:03.079
Who's trying to buy the stuff?
 

00:50:03.079 --> 00:50:05.780
What's the demand of the old
guys?

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.630
Student:
&gt;

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.650
Prof: And that's going
to be what?

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.690
They're planning to spend when
they're old.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:14.530
We're doing this one.
 

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.590
They make their plans when
they're young.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.478
They anticipate what the prices
are going to be and so how much

00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:22.389
do they plan to spend when
they're old?

00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:26.570
Student:
1 half times 3 1p--

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.239
Prof: 3 1p what?
 

00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:31.880
p what?
 

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.679
What p?
 

00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:34.360
Student:
p_small.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:38.449
Prof: p_small,
exactly.

00:50:38.449 --> 00:50:43.621
Over p_small, plus
Student:

00:50:43.621 --> 00:50:44.820
&gt;
 

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.389
Prof: What are the young
guys doing?

00:50:48.389 --> 00:50:49.610
We're over here.
 

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:50.650
So 2.
 

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:58.880
There are 2 of them.
 

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.559
What's this?
 

00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:01.719
p what?
 

00:51:01.719 --> 00:51:06.340
Divided by?
 

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.860
Oh, there's 1 half here.
 

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:12.989
Student:
&gt;

00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:14.199
Prof: 1.
 

00:51:14.199 --> 00:51:14.869
Okay, exactly.
 

00:51:14.869 --> 00:51:15.960
So that's it.
 

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.099
So there are 2 equations and 2
unknowns, p_big and

00:51:19.099 --> 00:51:21.070
p_small,
and 2 equations.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:25.840
So to solve this whole model,
you could get 2 equations--you

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.965
just have to solve these two
simultaneous equations,

00:51:29.965 --> 00:51:31.260
which I did.
 

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.789
And then you can find the
effect.

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:36.519
So the economist critiquers
would say, "Well,

00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:39.184
p_big should
equal--"

00:51:39.184 --> 00:51:42.840
What would be the price of
land, by the way?

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:53.250
So what's the price of land
going to be in the end?

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:57.512
What's going to be the price of
land, according to Fisher,

00:51:57.512 --> 00:51:58.409
at time 1?
 

00:51:58.409 --> 00:52:02.949
At time 1, let's say.
 

00:52:02.949 --> 00:52:04.829
So right here,
what's the price of land?

00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:07.625
Remember, it's the price after
the dividend is paid,

00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.268
so what's the price of land?
 

00:52:09.268 --> 00:52:13.570
Student:
&gt;

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.710
Prof: Let's do the
present value of the discounted

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.170
dividends.
 

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:21.219
What would it be?
 

00:52:21.219 --> 00:52:32.449
Maybe I'd better write it over
here.

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:37.356
Remember, the dividends are
just 1 1--you know,

00:52:37.356 --> 00:52:43.115
1 --so there's going to be 1 1
1 1, but I'm going to be

00:52:43.115 --> 00:52:46.210
multiplying by something.
 

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:51.199
So what is the price of land?
 

00:52:51.199 --> 00:52:52.793
p_small,
incidentally,

00:52:52.793 --> 00:52:55.876
=--
I could always write that as 1

00:52:55.876 --> 00:53:01.719
over 1 r_small and I
could write p_big as 1

00:53:01.719 --> 00:53:04.170
over 1 r_big.
 

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:07.480
Okay, so what's the price of
land going to be?

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.644
So it's the price of land
starting here just after the

00:53:10.644 --> 00:53:11.780
dividend is paid.
 

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.711
So it's hard to think about
this, but if you can figure this

00:53:14.711 --> 00:53:16.333
out,
then you've totally understood

00:53:16.333 --> 00:53:18.751
everything in the course,
because this is so much

00:53:18.751 --> 00:53:22.289
more--it uses all the ideas in a
just way more complicated way.

00:53:22.289 --> 00:53:23.300
Yes?
 

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.909
Student:
&gt;

00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:30.750
Prof: Well,
start telling me the formula.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.318
So if I want--when I do the
first terms, what is this first

00:53:34.318 --> 00:53:34.750
term?
 

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:40.219
Student:
&gt;

00:53:40.219 --> 00:53:44.550
Prof: So you would put 1
r_small here?

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.829
Okay, and now what would you
put over here?

00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:51.739
Student:
1 r_big.

00:53:51.739 --> 00:53:54.539
Prof: You'd put 1
r_big here?

00:53:54.539 --> 00:53:59.130
Student:
&gt;

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.460
Prof: Okay, very good.
 

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.340
So now you guys really know
what's going on.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.030
What would you put over here?
 

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:08.239
Student:
&gt;

00:54:08.239 --> 00:54:09.650
Prof: Okay, exactly.
 

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:13.670
1 r_small time 1
r_big,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.349
times 1 r_small.
 

00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.900
Okay, that's that one.
 

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.960
I'm going to stop with that.
 

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.019
Too much.
 

00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:21.780
dot, dot, dot.
 

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.119
So you have the idea now.
 

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:24.539
What's the idea?
 

00:54:24.539 --> 00:54:28.429
You're taking the present value
of all the dividends.

00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:32.030
So this dividend,
you have to discount it by 1

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.630
r_small.
 

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.659
This one, you have to discount
it twice.

00:54:35.659 --> 00:54:37.829
First to bring it back here,
that's 1 r_big,

00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:39.588
then to bring it back here,
that's another 1

00:54:39.588 --> 00:54:40.489
r_small.
 

00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:42.260
So 1 r_big,
1 r_small.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.217
The third dividend,
you discount first at the small

00:54:45.217 --> 00:54:48.293
discount, then at the big
discount, then at the small

00:54:48.293 --> 00:54:50.010
discount, just like that.
 

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.400
You keep adding them.
 

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:59.443
So why should the prices--what
if you look at the price of land

00:54:59.443 --> 00:55:01.000
at time 2?
 

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.889
Is it the same number as that?
 

00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:06.409
Is it the same formula?
 

00:55:06.409 --> 00:55:10.199
Student:
&gt;

00:55:10.199 --> 00:55:13.188
Prof: It's not the same
formula, because at time 2

00:55:13.188 --> 00:55:15.641
you're starting here,
and the first discount is

00:55:15.641 --> 00:55:16.710
p_big.
 

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:21.844
So it's going to be 1 over 1
r_big 1 over 1

00:55:21.844 --> 00:55:26.684
r_big times 1
r_small 1 over 1

00:55:26.684 --> 00:55:31.423
r_big times 1
r_small times 1

00:55:31.423 --> 00:55:34.980
r_big dot,
dot, dot.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.719
So this isn't the same as that.
 

00:55:37.719 --> 00:55:40.755
It would only be the same as
that if r_big was = to

00:55:40.755 --> 00:55:43.184
r_small,
if p_small was equal

00:55:43.184 --> 00:55:44.349
to p_big.
 

00:55:44.349 --> 00:56:02.159
So which one do you think is
bigger?

00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:06.264
Do you think p_small
is = to p_big,

00:56:06.264 --> 00:56:10.139
or one of them is bigger than
the other, and why?

00:56:10.139 --> 00:56:11.739
That's the answer to the
critics' puzzle.

00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:14.101
So you see, you've taken
something that appeared in the

00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:14.670
newspapers.
 

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:16.829
It sounds like common sense.
 

00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:20.056
If there are all these
middle-aged people like me,

00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:23.219
bidding up--you know,
there are so many of us who

00:56:23.219 --> 00:56:24.800
want to hold stocks.
 

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.250
We're at the peak of our
earning power.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:31.219
We've got tremendous amounts of
money.

00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:33.340
What are we going to do with it
except put it into stocks.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.597
You'd think common sense would
be the price of stocks would

00:56:35.597 --> 00:56:36.219
have to go up.
 

00:56:36.219 --> 00:56:38.592
When we get old and we're
selling all our stocks,

00:56:38.592 --> 00:56:41.213
you'd think the price of stocks
would have to go down,

00:56:41.213 --> 00:56:41.659
okay?
 

00:56:41.659 --> 00:56:47.914
So that would tell you that the
interest rate was going to be

00:56:47.914 --> 00:56:50.000
bigger or smaller.
 

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.606
So that would suggest that the
price at time 1,

00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:57.447
when the small generation was
young, would be low,

00:56:57.447 --> 00:57:00.739
and the price at time 2 would
be high.

00:57:00.739 --> 00:57:04.280
And that could happen if this
interest rate was low,

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.639
and this interest rate was
high.

00:57:06.639 --> 00:57:08.840
But does that happen or doesn't
that happen?

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.190
You can't know until you solve
in the model.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.257
The critics said, "Oh,
that can't be right,

00:57:14.257 --> 00:57:16.626
because somehow the price
should even out and everybody

00:57:16.626 --> 00:57:19.126
should be looking ahead and
buying or selling at the right

00:57:19.126 --> 00:57:19.829
time."
 

00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:22.054
You can't buy and sell at the
right time, because you're going

00:57:22.054 --> 00:57:22.530
to be dead.
 

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:25.969
So you don't have much choice,
except when you're young here

00:57:25.969 --> 00:57:28.768
to save, and when you're old
here to dis-save.

00:57:28.768 --> 00:57:33.110
They seem to have overlooked
that small problem.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:36.590
So the point is that,
to know the answer,

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:40.070
you can't just reason it out
verbally.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:42.898
You have to write down a model,
solve for the model and see

00:57:42.898 --> 00:57:43.630
what happens.
 

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:50.164
And sure enough,
it happens--so we go back to

00:57:50.164 --> 00:57:52.539
the paper now.
 

00:57:52.539 --> 00:57:54.570
Okay, are there any questions
about this?

00:57:54.570 --> 00:58:31.110
 
 

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:34.072
Okay, so all I did in this
spreadsheet is I wrote down

00:58:34.072 --> 00:58:35.190
these 2 equations.
 

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:40.007
So you see that I've got the
young and the old are the same

00:58:40.007 --> 00:58:42.250
half, half log utilities.
 

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:46.679
The small generation is 3,1,
the big generation is 6,2.

00:58:46.679 --> 00:58:49.849
Land is always producing 1
every period and we get 2

00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:51.030
different prices.
 

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:54.050
The price is called
p_A.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.668
That's the A generation,
which is the small generation

00:58:56.668 --> 00:58:59.239
and the B generation,
which is the big generation.

00:58:59.239 --> 00:59:02.025
So you can see that
p_A is a very small

00:59:02.025 --> 00:59:05.159
number when the generation is
small, and that means the

00:59:05.159 --> 00:59:06.960
discount rate is very high.
 

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.764
So a high interest rate when
the generation is small,

00:59:09.764 --> 00:59:12.730
and a low interest rate when
the generations are big.

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:18.280
So in the money making peak of
the big generation,

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.920
the real interest rate is
small, and so that means you're

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.405
not discounting very much,
and so the prices are very high

00:59:24.405 --> 00:59:25.018
of land.
 

00:59:25.018 --> 00:59:28.161
And so sure enough,
the price when the small

00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:32.398
generation is young is 1.29,
and when the big generation is

00:59:32.398 --> 00:59:35.030
young, it's 2.08,
vastly higher.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:38.302
So it really is the case that
as the generations rise and

00:59:38.302 --> 00:59:40.097
fall,
the interest rates rise and

00:59:40.097 --> 00:59:42.309
fall and the price of land rises
and falls,

00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:44.780
and everybody's rational,
anticipating everything.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:49.489
So it really could be--I'm not
saying it's true,

00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:51.856
because it could be a
coincidence that these things

00:59:51.856 --> 00:59:53.777
all matched up,
but the fact is,

00:59:53.777 --> 00:59:57.452
demography can have a big
effect on economic equilibrium

00:59:57.452 --> 00:59:58.989
in the stock market.
 

00:59:58.989 --> 01:00:01.099
And you can be an economist and
believe in demography.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:03.793
You don't have to be a Marxist
or something to think demography

01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:06.659
and fertility and all that stuff
is going to affect the economy.

01:00:06.659 --> 01:00:09.791
For a long time,
economics tried to wall itself

01:00:09.791 --> 01:00:12.650
off from other social sciences
and say,

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.518
"Oh, those fertility
people and,

01:00:14.518 --> 01:00:16.030
you know, all those
touchy-feely people,

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.829
it's got nothing to do with the
real markets."

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:19.920
Well, it has a lot to do with
the real markets.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.579
Okay, so one last thing,
would you rather be in the

01:00:22.579 --> 01:00:24.760
small generation or the big
generation?

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.518
Student:
&gt;

01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:32.027
Prof: Of course,
the answer's there,

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:33.530
but tell me why.
 

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.219
Yeah?
 

01:00:34.219 --> 01:00:35.070
Student: Small.
 

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.429
Prof: Okay,
that's correct.

01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:37.909
So I'm screwed.
 

01:00:37.909 --> 01:00:39.530
And so why is that?
 

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.920
Student:
&gt;

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.907
Prof: It turned out to
be the utility of the--this is

01:00:47.907 --> 01:00:51.880
the utility of the big
generation per person.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.885
Of course, adding the two
people together,

01:00:53.885 --> 01:00:55.746
it's bigger,
so per person it was this,

01:00:55.746 --> 01:00:58.829
a lot less than the generation
of the utility of the small.

01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:01.260
So why did that happen?
 

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.360
Why exactly is that happening?
 

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.079
So remember,
I'm distinguishing your peak.

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:11.108
I'm calling young your peak
earning years and old I'm

01:01:11.108 --> 01:01:14.485
calling the stuff when you're
retired, I'm not earning very

01:01:14.485 --> 01:01:15.010
much.
 

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:20.159
So why is it that a high
interest rate is good?

01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:20.820
Yes.
 

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.333
Student:
It encourages consumption today

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:26.550
for the younger generation.
 

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.423
Prof: Well,
I think the point is,

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:30.539
if you're making money when
you're young,

01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:32.579
and you've got a high interest
rate,

01:01:32.579 --> 01:01:34.329
that means a high return.
 

01:01:34.329 --> 01:01:37.275
So you can make a big return
through your life,

01:01:37.275 --> 01:01:40.219
whereas my generation had a
very low return.

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:43.000
The return I'm getting now is
terrible.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.309
It's negative.
 

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:47.070
The return I'm getting now is
just hideous.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.449
But when my parents were young,
they were making an

01:01:50.449 --> 01:01:53.829
astronomical return,
incredible rates of return.

01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:56.664
And they were earning money in
their younger years and

01:01:56.664 --> 01:01:59.875
investing it to save when they
were old and they were getting

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.320
incredibly high return.
 

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.010
There was nothing to do with my
money.

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.443
There are so many people like
me pouring money into the stock

01:02:05.443 --> 01:02:07.121
market,
we're getting a very bad

01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:10.197
return, and that's why it's not
so good to be part of a big

01:02:10.197 --> 01:02:10.940
generation.
 

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.550
So other people had said the
same thing.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:15.449
They said big generations have
to squeeze into the same houses,

01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:18.389
so there's less housing stock,
or we build more houses,

01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:20.409
the next generation comes
along, there are all these

01:02:20.409 --> 01:02:22.469
houses built for them and there
are less of them,

01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:24.099
so they get better houses.
 

01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:26.389
Everything's better when you're
the small generation.

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:29.519
You're screwed as the big
generation and here's an example

01:02:29.519 --> 01:02:29.960
of it.
 

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.719
Okay, so that's it for Social
Security.

01:02:32.719 --> 01:02:35.960
All the things I wanted to say
about Social Security.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.422
Now the exam,
as I say, you won't have to do

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:43.690
the two generations and all that
stuff on the exam.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.269
But the first part about
solving for the .55,

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:49.320
that one you might have to do
something like that.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.001
But anyway, the lesson that you
can have a controversy in the

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:55.639
newspapers with arguments on
both sides,

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:58.708
you never can figure out the
right answer till you write down

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.219
a model.
 

01:02:59.219 --> 01:03:01.302
And the model can be very
simple, the kind of thing you

01:03:01.302 --> 01:03:02.500
could do as an undergraduate.
 

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.480
That's the lesson I'm trying to
communicate.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.795
All right, so from now on
though, we have to change gears

01:03:08.795 --> 01:03:11.757
and I think the course gets a
lot more interesting,

01:03:11.757 --> 01:03:12.289
okay.
 

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.742
But we needed all this
background basics to have the

01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:17.030
logic of finance.
 

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.570
But finance is really nothing
without uncertainty.

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:22.510
If you don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow,

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:24.300
that's when the thing gets
interesting,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.059
that's when you have to think
harder,

01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:28.293
that's when people make
mistakes, that's when a hedge

01:03:28.293 --> 01:03:30.898
fund can make a profit,
that's when everything gets

01:03:30.898 --> 01:03:33.222
more exciting,
when there's uncertainty,

01:03:33.222 --> 01:03:36.342
and we have to start adding
uncertainty to our thinking

01:03:36.342 --> 01:03:37.440
about the world.
 

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.829
So since I only have a few
minutes,

01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:44.846
I'm going to spend the last few
minutes just reminding you of

01:03:44.846 --> 01:03:49.860
what you're supposed to know
about uncertainty,

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.230
which is this slide, okay?
 

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:55.079
So it's not a very complicated
thing.

01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:57.639
Where's the--I see PowerPoint.
 

01:03:57.639 --> 01:04:01.300
Okay so there are two kinds of
uncertainty, one of which we're

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.739
never going to get to.
 

01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:05.594
So the uncertainty that we're
going to work with in this

01:04:05.594 --> 01:04:08.760
course is everybody understands
what could possibly happen.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.987
So this was a brilliant states
of the world model,

01:04:11.987 --> 01:04:12.909
it's called.
 

01:04:12.909 --> 01:04:16.608
So Leibniz is supposed--see,
it says states of the world

01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:17.550
right there.
 

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:21.521
Leibniz was the one who first
invented the idea of states of

01:04:21.521 --> 01:04:22.329
the world.
 

01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:23.990
He said, "We live in the
best of all possible

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.500
worlds."
 

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.574
So if you don't know what's
going to happen in the future,

01:04:27.574 --> 01:04:30.809
we're going to represent that
as many potential states of the

01:04:30.809 --> 01:04:31.349
world.
 

01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:34.373
Now there are other ways you
could model uncertainty,

01:04:34.373 --> 01:04:37.630
and it's a big subject in
epistemology and philosophy.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:41.987
I'm going to stay--hew closely
to the states of the world

01:04:41.987 --> 01:04:42.610
thing.
 

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.534
So if there's something about
the world we don't know

01:04:44.534 --> 01:04:46.313
tomorrow,
I'm not going to assume that

01:04:46.313 --> 01:04:49.219
it's just vague in our minds and
we can't quite make it out.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.670
I'm going to assume you
actually can make it out.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.302
It's just you don't know which
of the possibilities are going

01:04:54.302 --> 01:04:54.829
to happen.
 

01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:57.170
So it's many states of the
world.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.492
So an example of that,
of course, is spinning a dice,

01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:03.686
or spinning two dice,
so you don't know which of 36

01:05:03.686 --> 01:05:06.050
possibilities is going to
happen.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:10.880
Each of those would be one
state of the world.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.547
Okay, so those are all the
possible sums,

01:05:13.547 --> 01:05:17.615
so there are more states of the
world than there are outcomes,

01:05:17.615 --> 01:05:18.349
notice.
 

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:20.777
You can get 2 through 12,
is the sum of the dice,

01:05:20.777 --> 01:05:23.409
but there's still 36 possible
states of the world.

01:05:23.409 --> 01:05:27.043
And so that random variable,
the sum of the two dice,

01:05:27.043 --> 01:05:29.070
is expressed as a function.
 

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.235
It says, in every state of the
world, what is the random

01:05:32.235 --> 01:05:33.329
variable's value?
 

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:37.094
So our state of the world,
by that I mean something that's

01:05:37.094 --> 01:05:40.661
so detailed that it tells you
the value of every random

01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:41.518
variable.
 

01:05:41.518 --> 01:05:43.639
So that's how I'm going to be
thinking of uncertainty,

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:46.840
that we're here today and a
bunch of different things could

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.518
happen tomorrow,
and this is an exhaustive list

01:05:49.518 --> 01:05:51.690
of everything that can happen
tomorrow.

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:55.016
We're going to have to come
back and criticize this

01:05:55.016 --> 01:05:58.876
assumption, but it introduces
uncertainty in a way which is

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:01.340
still quantifiable and not
vague.

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.027
So you can talk about the
histograms of outcomes of the

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:07.007
dice, you know,
how many ways,

01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:10.217
what are the chances of getting
a 7,6 out of 36,

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:10.900
etc.
 

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.159
So this is stuff I'm sure you
all know, okay.

01:06:14.159 --> 01:06:18.721
The most famous histogram of
mathematics is the normal

01:06:18.721 --> 01:06:22.077
distribution,
which I don't have time to

01:06:22.077 --> 01:06:23.110
explain.
 

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.762
And so a normal distribution,
remember, is this exponential

01:06:25.762 --> 01:06:26.130
thing.
 

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.963
The dice example,
you know, sort of looks like

01:06:29.963 --> 01:06:30.389
it.
 

01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:33.733
In fact, if you had enough
dice, and you kept averaging

01:06:33.733 --> 01:06:35.838
their outcome,
it would be normally

01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:36.829
distributed.
 

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:38.650
So lots of things turn out to
be normal.

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:44.014
One of the properties of normal
is that the tail gets small very

01:06:44.014 --> 01:06:49.210
quickly, and so you're not going
to get very many outliers.

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.739
The normal distribution is a
very common distribution.

01:06:52.739 --> 01:06:56.231
There're lots of reasons why it
should occur all the time,

01:06:56.231 --> 01:06:59.539
and it's also mathematically
very easy to work with.

01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:02.255
So economists for a long time
assumed that everything was

01:07:02.255 --> 01:07:04.391
normally distributed,
but an implication,

01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:06.900
as I say, of normal
distribution is that it's very

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.460
unlikely something extreme is
going to happen,

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.210
because this thing goes down
exponentially fast to 0,

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.489
so you're almost never going to
see something way out here.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.690
Yet we get these crashes fairly
frequently.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.677
Every 10,20,
30 years or something,

01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:21.550
there's some gigantic outlier.
 

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.724
So clearly things can't be
normally distributed,

01:07:24.724 --> 01:07:26.750
and that's called fat tails.
 

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.860
I'm sure you've heard about
that in the newspaper.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.309
We're going to come back to
that.

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:37.079
Now there are a couple of
things that you need to--

01:07:37.079 --> 01:07:40.811
so you can represent the payoff
of any random variable as a

01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:42.804
picture,
and every state,

01:07:42.804 --> 01:07:44.409
what is its payoff?
 

01:07:44.409 --> 01:07:47.170
So a riskless random variable,
riskless investment,

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.489
will pay the same amount in
every state.

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:51.119
I still have a few minutes here.
 

01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:54.400
Okay, so now two incredibly
important concepts,

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.610
which I'm sure you know--or at
least the mean you know--just

01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:01.750
the average, what's the expected
payoff?

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.476
So the expected payoff is,
you multiply the outcome in

01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:07.768
every state by the probability
of the state and you add it up.

01:08:07.768 --> 01:08:11.949
Okay, so there are how many
different ways?

01:08:11.949 --> 01:08:14.679
So if you have 1 dice,
you can figure out the

01:08:14.679 --> 01:08:16.170
expectation of 1 dice.
 

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:18.542
It's equally likely to get 1,2,
3,4, 5 or 6,

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:21.469
and so if you add all those up,
multiplied by a sixth,

01:08:21.469 --> 01:08:22.850
you get 3 and 1 half.
 

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.140
So the expectation of 1 dice is
3 and 1 half.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:31.289
The expectation of two dice is
therefore--okay,

01:08:31.289 --> 01:08:33.430
that's 1 dice.
 

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.965
Okay, now the expectation of
adding 2 dice together is of

01:08:36.965 --> 01:08:39.600
course going to be 7,
because the expectation of 1

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.920
dice is 3 and 1 half and the
other dice is 3 and 1 half,

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.358
and so the expectation of the
sum is the sum of the

01:08:44.358 --> 01:08:45.960
expectation,
so it's 7.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.859
Okay, so you know that.
 

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:50.069
Now one more thing that you
have to know is the variance.

01:08:50.069 --> 01:08:54.182
So how do you measure how
uncertain you are about what's

01:08:54.182 --> 01:08:55.529
going to happen?
 

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:58.445
Well, the simplest number to
do, like with the dice,

01:08:58.445 --> 01:09:01.020
is to say, the expectation is 3
and 1 half.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.779
When we don't get 3 and 1 half,
it means there is some error.

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:06.560
Expectation wasn't confirmed.
 

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.722
So you could just measure the
error as the distance between 3

01:09:09.722 --> 01:09:11.779
and 1 half and what you actually
got.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:14.689
So if you got a 4 you could say
you were off by 1 half.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:17.260
But people don't do that.
 

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.212
They measure the square of the
distance and they take the

01:09:20.212 --> 01:09:23.640
average square of the distance,
and that's called the variance.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.948
So if you got 4 when you were
expecting 3 and 1 half,

01:09:26.948 --> 01:09:31.039
the error is 1 half squared,
so you take 1 sixth times 1

01:09:31.039 --> 01:09:33.818
half squared,
1 sixth times 1 and 1 half

01:09:33.818 --> 01:09:35.759
squared,
1 sixth times 2 and 1 half

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:36.220
squared.
 

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.948
That's for the high mistakes.
 

01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:40.894
And the low mistakes,
you'd take 1 half times 1 half

01:09:40.894 --> 01:09:42.136
squared,
1 half times 1 and 1 half

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.543
squared, plus 1 half time 2 and
1 half squared [correction:

01:09:43.543 --> 01:09:44.538
1 sixth times each error,
not 1 half].

01:09:44.538 --> 01:09:47.894
Now why do they use the
expected squared error instead

01:09:47.894 --> 01:09:49.729
of just the expected error?
 

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:53.585
Well, for this simple reason,
which you may not have thought

01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:57.337
of: if you had to guess--
if you looked at the error as

01:09:57.337 --> 01:10:00.010
the penalty for making a wrong
guess,

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:01.569
and you were forced at the
beginning to say,

01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:04.057
"What guess would you like
to make for how the dice is

01:10:04.057 --> 01:10:06.171
going to turn out--
how the dice is going to turn

01:10:06.171 --> 01:10:09.340
out and if you're wrong,
we'll penalize you by this

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.260
measure of error?"
 

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.904
Well, if you were just taking
the absolute error,

01:10:13.904 --> 01:10:16.880
your best guess would be any
number between 3 and 4.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.158
You could say 3 and 1 half,
but you could also say 3 and 1

01:10:19.158 --> 01:10:20.423
quarter,
because if you said 3 and 1

01:10:20.423 --> 01:10:22.484
quarter,
you'd become closer on all the

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:25.083
low rolls of the dice,
and be a little further off on

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:27.427
all the high rolls,
and you'd get exactly the same

01:10:27.427 --> 01:10:27.779
error.
 

01:10:27.779 --> 01:10:31.210
So you could say any number
between 3 and 4.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.569
But if you make the error the
square of the mistake,

01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:39.930
your best guess is always to
say the expectation.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:43.414
3 and 1 half is the only thing
you can say to minimize your

01:10:43.414 --> 01:10:46.179
expected penalty,
if the penalty is the squared

01:10:46.179 --> 01:10:46.779
error.
 

01:10:46.779 --> 01:10:50.358
So because of that--so that's
connected to a mathematical

01:10:50.358 --> 01:10:53.170
thing and orthogonal vectors and
all that.

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:56.243
Because of that,
the error we talk about always

01:10:56.243 --> 01:10:57.779
is the squared error.
 

01:10:57.779 --> 01:10:59.460
And so that's whenever we're
measuring uncertainty,

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.779
we're going to talk about the
squared error,

01:11:02.779 --> 01:11:04.856
the average of the squared
errors--or the square root of

01:11:04.856 --> 01:11:06.617
that,
which is called the standard

01:11:06.617 --> 01:11:07.189
deviation.
 

01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:09.408
Okay, I've one more minute to
just finish this.

01:11:09.408 --> 01:11:14.149
I'm assuming you all know that
or can learn that.

01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:16.521
One more thing,
I'm going to assume you know,

01:11:16.521 --> 01:11:18.408
the last thing is the
covariance.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:22.858
What does it mean to say that
random variables X and Y move in

01:11:22.858 --> 01:11:24.390
the same direction?
 

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.319
So this was quite a brilliant
thought.

01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:30.550
So what it means is that to
move in the same direction,

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:33.872
means if X surprises you by
being above what you would have

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.796
expected,
so if the expectation of X is X

01:11:36.796 --> 01:11:38.939
bar,
and the expectation of Y is Y

01:11:38.939 --> 01:11:42.363
bar, if you multiply the 2 and
they're both higher than you

01:11:42.363 --> 01:11:44.920
expected,
you'll get a positive number.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.965
If they're both lower than
expected, you'll also get a

01:11:46.965 --> 01:11:47.658
positive number.
 

01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:52.055
So by taking this sum,
the expected deviation from the

01:11:52.055 --> 01:11:54.722
expectation,
multiplied, you get a number

01:11:54.722 --> 01:11:56.104
which,
when it's very positive,

01:11:56.104 --> 01:11:58.256
it means they're either both
positive together or both

01:11:58.256 --> 01:11:59.109
negative together.
 

01:11:59.109 --> 01:12:01.170
So they're going in the same
direction.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.363
If one of them is above the
average while the other one's

01:12:03.363 --> 01:12:05.087
below the average,
then you'll get a negative

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:05.520
number.
 

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.460
So big covariance means they
move in the same direction.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.421
Big negative covariance means
they move in the negative

01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:13.078
direction.
 

01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:16.442
Okay, so I'm going to take it
for granted you know this,

01:12:16.442 --> 01:12:19.864
and we're going to take this
up, starting right after the

01:12:19.864 --> 01:12:21.699
exam, which is on Tuesday.
 

01:12:21.699 --> 01:12:27.000

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.520
Professor Robert
Shiller: I'm Bob Shiller.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.231
I have the pleasure of
introducing this Okun lecturer,

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:12.686
Lawrence Summers.
I wanted to say first that the

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:18.220
Okun Lecture Series was funded
by an anonymous donor in honor

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.459
of Arthur Okun,
who was Professor of Economics

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.984
here at Yale,
who later became Chairman of

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.080
the Council of Economic
Advisors,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.970
who founded with William
Brainard the Brookings Papers

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.560
on Economic Activity and was
widely admired both here at Yale

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.188
and around the world as an
economist that had a lot of

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:48.730
impact on policy--an economist
with a purpose.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.727
It's altogether fitting that we
have Lawrence Summers here as

00:00:53.727 --> 00:00:59.927
our Okun lecturer for this year.
Larry Summers--I'll go through

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:06.661
his career briefly--he started
out at age sixteen at MIT as a

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.501
physics major.
Fortunately for us,

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:15.890
he switched into economics at a
very--as a teenager.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.696
He got his PhD at Harvard.
He got tenure at Harvard at one

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:28.510
of the--he's one of the
earliest, at age twenty-eight.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.412
In 1993, he won the John Bates
Clark Medal for the best

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:36.590
economist under the age of
forty.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.970
He joined the staff of the
Council of Economic Advisors.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.903
He was Undersecretary of
Treasury for International

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.974
Affairs.
He was Chief Economist at The

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.779
World Bank.
He was the U.S.

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:55.203
Secretary of Treasury.
He was President of Harvard

00:01:55.203 --> 00:02:00.638
University and now he is a
University Professor at Harvard

00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:04.069
and also a Director at D.E.
Shaw.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.130
His research has done truly
stunning--I've always been a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.915
huge admirer of it--and it
covers many fields--public

00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:17.004
finance,
labor, macroeconomics,

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.530
and finance,
in particular.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.608
I thought I would just conclude
my introduction with a couple of

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:27.562
famous Larry Summers quotes.
These quotes are advice to

00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:31.896
graduate students but they might
as well be advice to any

00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:35.411
researcher.
Larry is quoted as saying,

00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:41.020
"You might as well work on big
problems because it takes just

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.631
as much time to write a paper on
a little problem as on a big

00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:51.278
problem."
Another bit of advice to

00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:59.763
students: "Do your research on
the economy not on the economic

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:04.237
literature."
I think that's a bit of wise

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:06.800
advice.
But, I think that--to me,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.389
that says something about the
essence of his research style.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.044
He's been extremely potent in
his work on very important

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:21.036
results that kind of shape our
view of the world and I think

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:26.029
that it's this research style
that is part of the reason why

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:30.430
he's been tapped for such
important positions.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.310
I'm pleased to introduce Larry
Summers.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.174
Professor Larry Summers:
Thank you, Bob,

00:03:51.174 --> 00:03:55.180
very much for that overly
generous introduction.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.819
At least one thing you said
wasn't quite right.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.926
It may or may not have been
economics' good luck when I left

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:09.600
physics, but it was surely the
good luck of the physics

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.630
profession when I left physics.

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.205
I appreciated your generosity
in reflecting on the different

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:51.740
sectors in which I've had a
chance to work.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.500
When I first moved from the
University to Washington,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.264
people asked me,
well what's different about

00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:08.579
being a senior Treasury official
from being a professor at

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:11.829
Harvard?
I realized the answer to that

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:14.441
one was easy.
As a professor at Harvard,

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.299
the single worst thing you
could do was to sign your name

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.399
to something you had not written
yourself.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.641
On the other hand,
in the Treasury Department,

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:28.603
it was a mark of effectiveness
to do so as frequently as

00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:31.281
possible.
Then, I got back to Harvard and

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:34.819
had the honor of serving as its
president and people asked me,

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:41.029
what was different about the
University from Washington?

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.514
In those first months I gave an
answer that in retrospect seems

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:47.100
slightly breathtaking in its
naiveté.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.390
I said, Washington is so
political;

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.157
there's so much opposition;
University is very different

00:05:55.157 --> 00:05:58.920
from that;
we're all on the same side.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.572
It is a real honor to be here
at Yale and it is a particular

00:06:06.572 --> 00:06:12.149
honor to deliver the Arthur Okun
lecture.

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:18.629
I am told that I first met Art
Okun when I was one week old,

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.999
as he and my father were close
friends during the time when

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:30.709
they were assistant professors
at Yale together.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:38.148
In fact, I grew up until a
certain age calling him Uncle

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.982
Art.
I don't have many vivid

00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:46.082
memories, but I have a quite
vivid memory and I was able to

00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:51.968
go back and place the year.
It was 1969 and Art delivered a

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:56.892
set of lectures,
probably a set of lectures like

00:06:56.892 --> 00:07:00.294
this one,
at the University of

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:04.689
Pennsylvania and he stayed at
our house.

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:11.399
He stayed up telling my parents
a whole set of stories about

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:16.290
life as an economist with Lyndon
Johnson.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.954
Some of the stories are a
little too raunchy to repeat

00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:26.587
right here, but it was the first
inkling I had that this academic

00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:30.547
research stuff,
like my parents did,

00:07:30.547 --> 00:07:37.410
really could have a very direct
and real impact on the policy

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.539
arena.
I remember, especially,

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:41.929
somehow--I don't know what
determines what makes an

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.889
impression on you when you're
fifteen,

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:48.427
fourteen--but my father telling
me this story of how there was

00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:52.889
a--and I have no idea whether
this story is actually true.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:58.429
But, the story he told was that
there was a publication that the

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:03.089
Department of Commerce published
called BCD,

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:06.161
which stood for Business
Cycle Digest,

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:10.071
which compiled all the facts
about the business cycle and

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.470
whether the economy was up or
whether the economy was down.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.755
Because of all this stuff that
economists had figured out,

00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:25.132
like Art, we now had these
practical policies that we could

00:08:25.132 --> 00:08:29.120
use so that when there was a
recession,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.503
we'd stop the recession from
happening and when there was an

00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:34.509
excessive boom,
we'd smooth off the boom.

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:37.889
So, we didn't necessarily have
to have business cycles anymore.

00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:43.159
We liked calling the
publication BCD.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:48.645
So, Art had had the clever idea
of renaming the publication to

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:53.502
The Business Conditions
Digest, to celebrate the

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:59.135
success of Keynesian economics.
Time went on and the first

00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:03.151
great success,
if there ever were any great

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.740
successes of my career as a
graduate student,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.827
came when Art Okun and George
Perry invited Kim Clark and I to

00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:18.916
give what was the first
significant paper that I had

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:24.734
written as a graduate student,
on labor market dynamics and

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:28.372
unemployment,
at the Brookings Papers on

00:09:28.372 --> 00:09:31.490
Economic Activity
Conference.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:37.400
It was the thrill of our young
lives and it was also a vastly,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.310
vastly better paper in the form
in which it was published than

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.930
it was in the form in which it
was originally written,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:56.063
thanks to Art.
I have a final memory that

00:09:56.063 --> 00:10:00.970
pertains to Art that also says
something about Art.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.687
I remember sometime in the
early 1980s sitting at the lunch

00:10:05.687 --> 00:10:10.811
table in the MIT faculty club in
a way that some of you who know

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:15.315
me won't find surprising.
I was declaiming on various

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:20.162
subjects with a certain lack of
reticence that perhaps was not

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:23.500
commensurate with my lack of
knowledge.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.271
I asserted some proposition and
Paul Samuelson turned to me and

00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:35.950
he said, Larry I just wrote a
eulogy for Art Okun,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.250
who died recently,
and I said that in all the

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:45.774
years that I had known Art Okun,
Art Okun had never said a

00:10:45.774 --> 00:10:50.434
stupid thing.
Well Larry, now I won't be able

00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:52.240
to say that about you.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.258
One of the things that gives me
particular pleasure in,

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:06.458
along with Greg Mankiw,
taking over the editorship of

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:10.721
the Brookings Papers on
Economic Activity from Bill

00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:15.654
Brainard and George Perry,
who had done such a stellar job

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:21.094
for the last twenty-five years,
is the knowledge that it was a

00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:24.840
project that had been initiated
by Art.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:31.862
It was a project that had been
initiated by Art out of a

00:11:31.862 --> 00:11:39.778
conviction that I have tried to
live by in my career and that I

00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:46.928
hope in some small way to
illustrate with my remarks here

00:11:46.928 --> 00:11:54.589
today--that serious economic
thinking can help one understand

00:11:54.589 --> 00:12:01.315
the world much better;
that with the aid of the

00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:08.431
metaphors and the models and the
measurements that come from

00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:14.976
serious economic thinking,
one can direct economic

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:21.070
policies in better and in more
sensible ways.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.802
As a consequence,
the lives of very large numbers

00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:29.391
of people, most of whom who will
never hear of economics and

00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:32.580
certainly will not study its
details,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.523
will in some way be improved by
having higher incomes,

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:44.961
by facing less risk,
by being more secure as they go

00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:51.223
through their livelihoods.
It's in that spirit that I want

00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:56.740
to reflect today on some aspects
of macroeconomic thinking and

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.896
experience and then some aspects
of financial thinking and

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:06.779
experience and how they bear on
financial crisis.

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:11.029
Then tomorrow,
on the particular financial

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:16.419
crisis that we face right now,
what has been done,

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:21.092
what may happen,
what should be done,

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:28.750
and what can be done over the
longer term to make the return

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:35.110
of such a crisis more
important--less likely.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.935
Art was preoccupied through
most of his career with the

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:44.940
central macroeconomic issue of
assuring stable growth.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.224
To use language that's perhaps
more congenial to older than

00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:57.399
younger ears--avoiding
underemployment and output gaps.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.428
It's revealing that the journal
he founded was called the

00:14:00.428 --> 00:14:02.970
Brookings Papers on Economic
Activity,

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.476
suggesting a concern with the
cyclical performance of the

00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:11.982
economy.
He surely, as much as anyone,

00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:17.026
would have subscribed to Jim
Tobin's famous dictum--that it

00:14:17.026 --> 00:14:21.374
takes a heap of Harberger
triangles to fill an Okun

00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:25.983
gap--or that the macroeconomic
issues of recession and

00:14:25.983 --> 00:14:31.500
depression are terribly,
terribly important relative to

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.048
the microeconomic efficiencies
that are a preoccupation of a

00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:44.477
very large number of economists.
This idea, this first idea that

00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:48.481
Okun gaps exist,
and are large,

00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:56.756
and are very important relative
to microeconomic inefficiencies

00:14:56.756 --> 00:15:03.830
is one that is increasingly
unfashionable today.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.722
Discussing them within the
context of what has been called,

00:15:07.722 --> 00:15:11.279
although I suppose it can't be
called that anymore,

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:14.719
the new classical
macroeconomics is almost

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:17.893
impossible;
there's no role for any kind of

00:15:17.893 --> 00:15:21.299
gap.
It's much like discussing

00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:25.720
epicycles with a modern
astronomer.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.656
Even within a Keynesian
tradition, the accepted versions

00:15:32.656 --> 00:15:40.348
of the Keynesian model greatly
circumscribe the scope for what

00:15:40.348 --> 00:15:47.158
was Art's major concern:
underemployment and the output

00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:51.687
gap.
If one thinks about the

00:15:51.687 --> 00:16:00.070
centerpiece of the supply side
of any macroeconomic model,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:07.521
almost any macroeconomic model
post 1980, in some form or other

00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:14.853
it has the implication that the
change in inflation is in some

00:16:14.853 --> 00:16:20.353
way dependent on the output gap.
Perhaps it's the change in

00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:22.517
inflation;
perhaps even more

00:16:22.517 --> 00:16:26.930
problematically,
it's the unexpected component

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.783
of inflation.
Perhaps the causation runs the

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:38.679
other way and the output gap is
related to the--is caused by the

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:45.028
change in inflation or is caused
by the level of unexpected

00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:48.023
inflation.
Any equation,

00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:53.747
any theory of output that has
that property has a simple

00:16:53.747 --> 00:17:00.200
consequence if you aggregate it
over a long period of time.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.022
Namely, that if you look at the
difference between inflation at

00:17:05.022 --> 00:17:09.223
the end of the period and
inflation at the beginning of

00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:11.588
the period,
or equivalently,

00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:15.782
if you look at the average
level of unexpected inflation,

00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:20.866
which has to be zero,
it will relate to the size of

00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:25.289
the output gap.
Therefore, if one thinks of a

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:30.509
steady state as being a state in
which unexpected inflation

00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:35.190
averages zero or a state in
which the accelerant,

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.576
the change in inflation,
averages zero,

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:44.770
you know what the output gap
has got to be;

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:50.924
it has got to average zero.
This doesn't mean there's no

00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:56.450
role for cyclical policy,
but it has the very strong

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:02.736
implication that what you gain
in the booms you lose in the

00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:06.243
recessions.
If you have deeper recessions,

00:18:06.243 --> 00:18:08.549
you will be able to have larger
booms;

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:15.028
that if you have larger booms,
you will be able to have--you

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:19.750
will be forced to have deeper
recessions.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:26.854
In a sense, if one accepts this
idea, the subject of cyclical

00:18:26.854 --> 00:18:33.840
fluctuations in macroeconomics
becomes an order of magnitude

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.827
less important than it was if
one maintained some older idea

00:18:40.827 --> 00:18:48.050
in which it's possible to have
output gaps that are not offset

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:55.473
by subsequent gains in output.
To be sure, much has been made

00:18:55.473 --> 00:19:01.381
of the point at certain moments;
there may be some impact of

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:06.565
non-linearity in the
relationship between the gap and

00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:11.650
the change in inflation or
unexpected inflation.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:17.003
If this relationship is
non-linear, then it's possible

00:19:17.003 --> 00:19:22.761
that by running a smoother
economy, one can run a somewhat

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:26.998
higher-pressure economy.
In a world where

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:31.927
econometricians struggle to
estimate any kind of Phillips

00:19:31.927 --> 00:19:34.707
Curve,
the idea that one can measure

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:38.270
with any precision a
non-linearity of this kind is,

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:46.704
at the very least, problematic.
Ironically, the Keynesian model

00:19:46.704 --> 00:19:53.035
as it came to evolve--the
Keynesian model that--and the

00:19:53.035 --> 00:20:00.186
Keynesian discussion that had as
its center piece the Phillips

00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:06.229
Curve in some form,
in almost all of the forms in

00:20:06.229 --> 00:20:13.023
which the Phillips Curve came,
was quite skeptical of the role

00:20:13.023 --> 00:20:18.925
of macroeconomic policy in
affecting average levels of

00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:25.020
output through time.
Very little room for Art Okun's

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.000
dedication to closing output
gaps or maintaining a higher

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.406
pressure economy as a way of
spurring economic growth or as a

00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:43.279
way of promoting a more equal
income distribution.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:49.342
Art's lastâ€“the last
decade of Art's professional

00:20:49.342 --> 00:20:55.748
work was directed at questions
that in one way or another

00:20:55.748 --> 00:21:01.103
relate to these equations.
His final book was entitled

00:21:01.103 --> 00:21:05.590
Prices and Quantities.
His dominant professional

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.976
preoccupation was,
in his last years,

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:14.430
with how the rate of inflation
could be brought down with a

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.380
minimum level of the output gap
with,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:24.630
as he would have put it,
a minimum sacrifice ratio.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:31.411
It's not hard to understand why
these questions relating to

00:21:31.411 --> 00:21:37.842
inflation and output were
preoccupations of Art's during

00:21:37.842 --> 00:21:45.932
his professional lifetime.
It's interesting to think about

00:21:45.932 --> 00:21:50.220
U.S.
business cycle history.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:56.641
When people like me gave talks
about the economic outlook to

00:21:56.641 --> 00:22:02.410
non-academic audiences fifteen
or twenty years ago,

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:08.752
it was considered a cleverness
to observe that American

00:22:08.752 --> 00:22:13.920
economic expansions do not die
of old age;

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.774
they're murdered by the Federal
Reserve with inflation control

00:22:19.774 --> 00:22:25.094
as the motive.
If one thought about--thinks

00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:33.609
about--a universe of experience,
the three Eisenhower recessions

00:22:33.609 --> 00:22:40.886
that were formative for Art,
although I believe the second

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:46.634
of them coincided with my
birth--the 1966-1967 economic

00:22:46.634 --> 00:22:53.339
downturn--more conspicuously the
major downturns in '74-'75,

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.453
in the wake of the oil supply
shock, and in 1980-'82,

00:22:57.453 --> 00:23:01.997
the Volcker disinflation;
these were most of the

00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:08.236
experience we had with the
business cycle in a substantial

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:13.912
sloth of economic history.
The economy expanded in one way

00:23:13.912 --> 00:23:18.676
or another, inflation got out of
control, people got nervous

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:23.569
about inflation,
the Fed hit the brakes,

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:30.436
interest rates spiked,
the yield curve inverted,

00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:36.423
the economy slowed.
To be sure, there were great

00:23:36.423 --> 00:23:42.069
controversies about how--what
exactly the mechanism was.

00:23:42.069 --> 00:23:45.087
What was the role of credit
rationing in the housing sector

00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:48.879
versus higher interest rates?
To what extent did the

00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:54.130
transmission mechanism take
place through Tobin's Q.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.914
If one asked,
what was the cause of

00:23:58.914 --> 00:24:03.980
downturns, the cause was
monetary.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:11.736
The accounts of business cycle
historians who tracked events

00:24:11.736 --> 00:24:18.660
were couched in those terms.
The enormously influential

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:25.425
monetary history of the United
States emphasized the role of

00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:31.960
monetary contractions and of
Federal Reserve policies.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.106
The academic issues of the day,
which focused critically on the

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:43.368
questions of price rigidity,
therefore led to a natural

00:24:43.368 --> 00:24:47.593
focus as the canonical
experiment of--suppose you

00:24:47.593 --> 00:24:49.680
reduce M,
the money stock,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.481
what happens to the level of
output in the short-run and why

00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:57.144
does that happen?
The prevailing view about

00:24:57.144 --> 00:25:02.464
business cycles was that they
were determined by monetary

00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:07.404
policy and what led to
contractionary monetary policy

00:25:07.404 --> 00:25:13.390
was either a mistake by the Fed
or a necessary action by the Fed

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:18.883
as inflation accelerated.
It is interesting to

00:25:18.883 --> 00:25:26.119
contemplate that if one looks
before or after what one might

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:33.601
think of as the Okun period and
tries to give a simple account

00:25:33.601 --> 00:25:40.960
of what was behind the business
cycles that took place,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:49.700
one offers a rather different
kind of story.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:55.680
1907 is linked to a financial
panic;

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:01.888
it couldn't have been caused by
the Feds, since the Fed didn't

00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:06.051
exist yet.
In 1929, the actions of the

00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:12.259
Federal Reserve in 1928 or 1929
may or may not have been a

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:18.379
crucial causative factor,
but there's a reason they talk

00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:24.619
about the stock market crash as
a prelude to The Depression.

00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:31.189
The dominant influences were
endogenous to the workings of

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:38.227
the financial system.
If one thinks about the three

00:26:38.227 --> 00:26:45.943
most recent instances of
cyclical fluctuation in the

00:26:45.943 --> 00:26:51.843
United States,
the 1990,1992 case can be

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:55.250
debated.
There was an oil shock;

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.889
there had been some tightening
of monetary policy,

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:03.122
but I think most observers
would assign dominant influence

00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:07.430
to the problems in the financial
system associated with the

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.630
S&amp;L's and the overextension
of banks in real estate lending.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:17.650
There's no question that almost
any close watcher,

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:22.055
if asked to say,
what was the 2001 recession

00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:27.561
about,
they would say bursting of the

00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:34.141
technology bubble.
I'll have more to say about the

00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:39.211
2008 recession a little later
and tomorrow,

00:27:39.211 --> 00:27:46.333
including some speculations on
the probability that there is

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:50.788
one.
No one would say of the current

00:27:50.788 --> 00:27:57.308
fluctuation that it reflected
the Federal Reserve's excessive

00:27:57.308 --> 00:28:03.067
or necessary effort to curb
inflation in product price

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:07.686
markets.
Rather, they would attribute it

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:12.961
in one way or another to
something endogenous to the

00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:16.597
financial system.
The debates would turn on

00:28:16.597 --> 00:28:20.172
whether it was best thought of
in terms of a housing price

00:28:20.172 --> 00:28:24.922
bubble;
whether it was best thought of

00:28:24.922 --> 00:28:32.479
as a matter having to do with
the excessive extension of

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:37.693
subprime credit;
whether it was a reflection of

00:28:37.693 --> 00:28:42.206
a generalized excessive
complacency in credit markets

00:28:42.206 --> 00:28:46.980
that led to the extension of
financial institutions.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:54.450
All of those questions could be
debated, but no serious dispute

00:28:54.450 --> 00:29:01.679
about the proposition that it
came out of the workings of the

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:07.640
financial system.
With this history before us,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:14.867
in thinking about macroeconomic
policy and in thinking about

00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:21.121
cyclical fluctuations,
seems to me appropriate that we

00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:26.989
at least consider redirecting
some macroeconomic attention

00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:32.446
from traditional preoccupations
with the price setting

00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:39.034
process--the Phillips Curve--and
disinflation to more traditional

00:29:39.034 --> 00:29:45.006
Keynesian preoccupations with
the workings of the financial

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:49.329
system with animal
spirits--with,

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:53.927
if you like,
shocks to the IS Curve that

00:29:53.927 --> 00:29:59.940
come out of the workings of the
financial system.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:06.577
This view, I would suggest,
is certainly confirmed by less

00:30:06.577 --> 00:30:12.400
detailed reflection on
international experience.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.278
One thinks about the two most
dramatic OECD macroeconomic

00:30:17.278 --> 00:30:21.433
events of the last twenty years.
They are almost always--excuse

00:30:21.433 --> 00:30:23.303
me, President Zedillo,
[former Mexican President

00:30:23.303 --> 00:30:25.131
Ernesto Zedillo,
who was among the people seated

00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:26.444
in the classroom for Summers'
lecture.]

00:30:26.444 --> 00:30:33.163
permanent OECD member events,
so I exclude the drama of which

00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:42.579
you were a--you were so central,
so central a part.

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:47.561
They were, almost certainly,
the Japanese financial crisis

00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:52.806
followed by depression in the
1990s and the dramatic declines

00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:58.400
in output associated with the
failure of the banking system,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:05.586
to the point where it needed to
be nationalized in the Nordic

00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:14.054
countries in the early 1990s.
Indeed, it is interesting to

00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:23.052
note that in recent years
financial crises have become

00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:26.895
pervasive.
One always remembers the

00:31:26.895 --> 00:31:30.710
comments one makes about
economic fluctuations that prove

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.730
to be prescient and forgets the
ones that prove to have been

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.380
completely wrong.
I am no exception.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:45.217
I will recall that I was fond
of observing in 2005 and 2006

00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:50.640
that if one looked at the last
twenty years,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.109
there had been six or
seven--six major financial

00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:02.339
crises: the 1987 stock market
crash;

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:07.089
the 1990 savings and loan real
estate crash;

00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:13.300
the 1995 Mexican crash--some
would argue that if this is a

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.460
U.S.
list, that Mexico doesn't

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.343
belong and one could have that
argument--the 1997 Asian

00:32:22.343 --> 00:32:27.773
financial crisis;
the events associated with LTCM

00:32:27.773 --> 00:32:32.960
and Russia that President
Clinton and Secretary Rubin,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.445
at the time,
labeled the most serious

00:32:36.445 --> 00:32:40.900
financial crisis since the
Second World War;

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:48.507
and the 2001 financial crisis
associated with the bursting of

00:32:48.507 --> 00:32:54.056
the tech bubble,
problems in the high yield

00:32:54.056 --> 00:33:01.846
sector, the subsequent problems
in capital markets--exemplified

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:09.003
by what happened at Enron.
It is interesting to ask the

00:33:09.003 --> 00:33:16.155
question, whether there is some
relation between all these

00:33:16.155 --> 00:33:20.470
events.
Because what I've suggested so

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:26.592
far is that if one distinguishes
the last generation from the

00:33:26.592 --> 00:33:32.000
preceding generation--in the
preceding generation,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.730
financial crises were
relatively rare;

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.070
business cycles were caused by
the Federal Reserve

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.119
eliminating--Federal Reserve's
concern about inflation.

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:49.600
For the last generation,
business cycles have been

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.646
associated with financial crisis
and the Federal Reserve has not

00:33:56.646 --> 00:34:02.910
caused downturns through its
concern with inflation.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:10.619
How are these events linked?
I'm not entirely sure.

00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:14.227
Sitting in the Brookings
Papers meetings for all

00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:17.768
these years, I've learned how
Bill Nordhaus is hard to

00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:20.126
satisfy.
Sometimes people have

00:34:20.126 --> 00:34:23.906
t-statistics of three and Bill
pronounces them to be

00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:27.834
quote-unquote Darwinian,
reflecting the data mining of

00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:30.220
the author.
On other occasions,

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.306
they have only a few
observations,

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:36.162
in which case they're deemed to
have committed one-observation

00:34:36.162 --> 00:34:40.276
econometrics.
I'm going to commit about

00:34:40.276 --> 00:34:47.183
four-observation econometrics
and offer the hypothesis that

00:34:47.183 --> 00:34:53.136
the right way to understand this
pattern is that we

00:34:53.136 --> 00:35:00.519
achieved--that Art's generation
and then Paul Volcker--achieved

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:08.101
a hugely important thing.
They achieved a measure of

00:35:08.101 --> 00:35:15.935
credibility and commitment to
non-inflationary monetary

00:35:15.935 --> 00:35:24.204
policies that enabled inflation
expectations to be kept in

00:35:24.204 --> 00:35:29.039
check.
That, just as success in curing

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:35.517
infectious disease leads there
to be far more cancer than there

00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:41.159
was before infectious disease
was brought in check,

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:49.694
so too the achievement of
disinflation leads to an economy

00:35:49.694 --> 00:35:58.828
in which expansions are enabled
to continue until they lead to

00:35:58.828 --> 00:36:07.063
the complacency and confidence
associated with financial

00:36:07.063 --> 00:36:10.501
crisis.
Perhaps we will have 6%

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:14.391
inflation two years from now and
the Fed will cause--Fed will

00:36:14.391 --> 00:36:18.346
find it necessary to engineer a
recession and this theory will

00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:23.461
fall completely by the wayside.
Perhaps there is an

00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:32.099
alternative, more compelling
explanation for this pattern.

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:37.611
But for now,
I would adduce the hypothesis

00:36:37.611 --> 00:36:45.946
that the increased incidence of
financial crisis and the closer

00:36:45.946 --> 00:36:54.282
relationship between financial
crisis and economic downturns is

00:36:54.282 --> 00:37:01.810
a by-product of our success in
achieving low and credible

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:09.070
inflation and the associated
great moderation.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:17.588
Whether or not we can accept
that idea as to why financial

00:37:17.588 --> 00:37:26.107
crisis seems to have been the
cause of previous recessions

00:37:26.107 --> 00:37:34.488
where it was not previously,
the empirical observation

00:37:34.488 --> 00:37:42.117
stands that financial crises are
frequent and that not

00:37:42.117 --> 00:37:47.557
infrequently,
when there is a financial

00:37:47.557 --> 00:37:54.334
crisis, it leads to some
significant disruption in real

00:37:54.334 --> 00:38:01.478
economic activity.
It follows that the causes of

00:38:01.478 --> 00:38:10.652
financial crisis and the policy
response to financial crisis

00:38:10.652 --> 00:38:18.581
need to occupy a larger part of
our consideration of

00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:26.199
macroeconomics than they have
traditionally.

00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:34.526
I should suggest also that this
is--this conclusion is

00:38:34.526 --> 00:38:40.340
reinforced by the observation
that,

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:46.041
whereas disinflation recession
lends itself very much to the

00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:50.970
unfortunate conservation
argument I presented at the

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:56.575
beginning that suggested that
you couldn't really alter the

00:38:56.575 --> 00:39:02.180
output gap over long periods of
time if you did not want to

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.608
accept changes in inflation.
It is easy to understand

00:39:07.608 --> 00:39:11.994
financial crisis and the
associated downturns in output

00:39:11.994 --> 00:39:15.079
as a reduction in aggregate
supply.

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:17.118
And, therefore,
[it is]

00:39:17.118 --> 00:39:22.306
highly plausible to believe
that the better management of

00:39:22.306 --> 00:39:27.216
financial crisis or the
prevention of financial crisis

00:39:27.216 --> 00:39:32.219
will lead not just to a smoother
path of output,

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:35.858
but a path that,
by avoiding downturns,

00:39:35.858 --> 00:39:40.550
has a higher average over long
periods of time.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.307
And, therefore,
[it]

00:39:42.307 --> 00:39:47.952
is more successful in achieving
the goal that Art Okun and Jim

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:53.135
Tobin and Yale,
for many, many years,

00:39:53.135 --> 00:40:02.758
set for macroeconomic policy of
raising the average level of

00:40:02.758 --> 00:40:08.128
output.
Now, discussions of financial

00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:13.799
crisis tend to have the
character of accident

00:40:13.799 --> 00:40:17.912
investigations.
There are many different

00:40:17.912 --> 00:40:22.335
suspects;
great numbers of details are

00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:28.003
mustered to tell the story.
There are always particular

00:40:28.003 --> 00:40:31.769
words associated with particular
financial crises.

00:40:31.769 --> 00:40:35.649
One talks about portfolio
insurance in the context of the

00:40:35.649 --> 00:40:39.709
1987 crash.
One talks about Tesobonos in

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:44.110
the context of the Mexican
experience.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:49.305
One talks about bubble
psychology in the context of the

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:53.870
NASDAQ experience.
One uses the--one speaks about

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.742
the viscidities of the
separation between the

00:40:57.742 --> 00:41:02.935
originators and the owners of
mortgages in talking about the

00:41:02.935 --> 00:41:06.280
current subprime mortgage
crisis.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.530
It all brings to mind Tolstoy's
observation that every happy

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:18.674
family is the same and every
unhappy family is miserable in

00:41:18.674 --> 00:41:24.254
its own way.
It is all correct--not all of

00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:32.156
it is correct--but in each of
the crises there are important

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:40.059
elements of institutional detail
of particular practice that

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:48.230
explain how the story played out
in the way that it did.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:54.930
I want to suggest that there is
some common structure that lies

00:41:54.930 --> 00:42:00.550
behind the various phenomena
that are associated with

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:06.290
financial crisis.
The understanding of which can

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:13.000
at least help us to think about
the mechanism of crisis and

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.090
perhaps the appropriate policy
responses.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:25.728
For thinking about financial
crises, economics has a classic

00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:32.719
metaphor that captures many
elements of the problem.

00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:35.825
It's a set of ideas that go
back at least to Bagehot

00:42:35.825 --> 00:42:38.809
[British businessman and writer
Walter Bagehot,

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:41.311
1826-1877]
economic history and are known

00:42:41.311 --> 00:42:44.875
to current economic theorists as
Diamond-Dybvig phenomena.

00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:47.751
[Douglas Diamond and Philip
Dybvig, "Bank Runs,

00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:50.190
Deposit Insurance and
Liquidity,"

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:55.079
Journal of Political Economy,
91(3), 1983]The idea is simple,

00:42:55.079 --> 00:43:00.630
powerful, and incomplete.
Imagine a bank;

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:07.181
the bank takes deposits;
the deposits can be withdrawn

00:43:07.181 --> 00:43:12.980
at any moment or at least can be
withdrawn at high frequency.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:19.780
It takes the deposits and it
lends the money for projects.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:27.278
The projects have a higher rate
of return than the deposits do,

00:43:27.278 --> 00:43:34.292
but the projects take some
significant time to complete and

00:43:34.292 --> 00:43:40.460
there is no market for a
half-finished project.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:47.360
Think about that financial
institution;

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:54.463
perhaps it also chooses to keep
a portion of its deposits on

00:43:54.463 --> 00:44:00.610
hand in cash.
A moment's reflection on that

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:09.441
financial institution will cause
you to recognize that it is

00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:18.328
subject to multiple equilibria.
If everyone believes that the

00:44:18.328 --> 00:44:25.269
bank will remain healthy,
the bank will in fact remain

00:44:25.269 --> 00:44:30.030
healthy.
Depositors all can be paid back;

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:34.534
the project will be completed;
the bank shareholders are

00:44:34.534 --> 00:44:39.190
better off;
the depositors are better off;

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:44.418
the entrepreneurs who have been
lent money for their projects

00:44:44.418 --> 00:44:49.394
are better off.
It is a Nash Equilibrium and

00:44:49.394 --> 00:44:55.533
everyone is better off.
It is not, however,

00:44:55.533 --> 00:45:03.601
the only Nash Equilibrium.
A moment's thought will also

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:10.934
cause you to realize that if
everyone else is taking their

00:45:10.934 --> 00:45:17.230
money out of the bank,
then you are well advised to

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:23.940
take your money out of the bank
as soon as you can because the

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:31.309
bank is not going to be able to
pay off all of the claims on it.

00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:38.869
A solvent bank is subject to
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:46.689
It can either remain solvent or
it can fail depending upon the

00:45:46.689 --> 00:45:53.488
state not just of expectations,
but in a manner much like

00:45:53.488 --> 00:45:58.316
Keynes's Beauty
Contest--expectations of others'

00:45:58.316 --> 00:46:01.740
expectations.
If I expect that you expect

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.389
that TN [Professor T.
N.

00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:06.094
Srinivasan, Yale University]
expects that the bank is going

00:46:06.094 --> 00:46:08.380
to fail and that he is going to
withdraw money,

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:14.940
then the safer thing for me to
do is to withdraw money.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:21.669
If one wants a simple theory of
why if you go to any American

00:46:21.669 --> 00:46:27.949
town and you look for the most
solidly built building,

00:46:27.949 --> 00:46:31.157
with the most impressive
façade,

00:46:31.157 --> 00:46:35.210
it will be a building that was
used as a bank,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.634
particularly if it was
constructed before the era of

00:46:39.634 --> 00:46:44.389
deposit insurance.
It is precisely this notion of

00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:49.019
multiple equilibrium that
explains why banks,

00:46:49.019 --> 00:46:55.736
more than other institutions,
are at such pains to project

00:46:55.736 --> 00:47:00.449
credibility and to project
permanence.

00:47:00.449 --> 00:47:05.907
Notice that this metaphor is
very powerful and is very

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:11.262
suggestive of a case for
activism because it suggests

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:16.823
that there are multiple
possibilities to which the free

00:47:16.823 --> 00:47:21.770
market will be subject.
It suggests that if

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:27.652
coordination can be achieved,
there are possibilities that

00:47:27.652 --> 00:47:33.740
are unambiguously better for
everyone and possibilities that

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:40.896
are worse for everyone.
It suggests a natural role for

00:47:40.896 --> 00:47:49.430
government as a coordinator or
as a guarantor in favor of the

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:54.537
better equilibrium.
Now to be sure,

00:47:54.537 --> 00:48:02.844
the more rigorous and skeptical
among you will have noticed that

00:48:02.844 --> 00:48:10.360
I slipped an important issue by
in telling this story;

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:16.330
I said quickly that there was
no market for unfinished

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.885
projects.
It's hard to understand why,

00:48:19.885 --> 00:48:24.847
if it's a certainty that all
unfinished projects are going to

00:48:24.847 --> 00:48:29.561
succeed and it's a certainty
that when they do succeed the

00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:34.441
bank will have more money--have
enough money--to pay off its

00:48:34.441 --> 00:48:38.099
depositors;
why there will not be some

00:48:38.099 --> 00:48:42.856
profit-maximizing actor who is
prepared to come in and buy

00:48:42.856 --> 00:48:47.213
those unfinished projects and,
in the process,

00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:54.745
make the depositors whole.
In the language that is always

00:48:54.745 --> 00:49:03.881
used in talking--frequently used
in talking--about financial

00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:08.345
crisis,
it's hard to understand how you

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:13.988
can have a liquidity problem
without at least the possibility

00:49:13.988 --> 00:49:18.251
of a solvency problem.
And once you have the

00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:23.258
possibility of a solvency
problem, it becomes less clear

00:49:23.258 --> 00:49:28.538
just how much you're making
everybody better off by lending

00:49:28.538 --> 00:49:33.272
the money or by allowing the
projects to be partially

00:49:33.272 --> 00:49:36.339
completed.
Nonetheless,

00:49:36.339 --> 00:49:43.429
this liquidity--nonetheless,
this Diamond-Dybvig bank run

00:49:43.429 --> 00:49:51.278
metaphor has been very powerful
in influencing financial policy

00:49:51.278 --> 00:49:59.066
in a wide range of situations.
It was this idea that was the

00:49:59.066 --> 00:50:03.579
justification,
albeit without mentioning

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:10.326
Diamond or Dybvig's name,
that Secretary Rubin [Treasury

00:50:10.326 --> 00:50:16.171
Secretary Robert Rubin]
and I used in explaining to

00:50:16.171 --> 00:50:23.184
President Clinton why it was
important that we support Mexico

00:50:23.184 --> 00:50:30.431
in 1995 and in countless other
efforts of what their supporters

00:50:30.431 --> 00:50:37.094
call support programs and their
opponents call bailouts in

00:50:37.094 --> 00:50:43.767
financial history.
When institutions or countries

00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:50.100
or individuals in financial
distress were provided with

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:55.026
support,
the concept of it's a liquidity

00:50:55.026 --> 00:51:02.064
problem, so by providing support
we can coordinate around the

00:51:02.064 --> 00:51:07.510
positive equilibrium,
was invoked.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:13.015
This idea of a bank run or a
set of bank runs and the

00:51:13.015 --> 00:51:19.685
provision of support provides a
powerful way of thinking about a

00:51:19.685 --> 00:51:25.429
destructive,
gap-increasing financial crisis.

00:51:25.429 --> 00:51:32.658
It certainly fits a variety of
situations--the situation that

00:51:32.658 --> 00:51:38.994
Mexico faced in 1985;
perhaps the situation that Bear

00:51:38.994 --> 00:51:45.579
Stearns faced several weeks ago;
certainly the situation that

00:51:45.579 --> 00:51:51.855
the Fed was concerned about that
has led it to provide financial

00:51:51.855 --> 00:51:58.230
support in the form of back-stop
facilities of many kinds to many

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:05.032
financial institutions.
It does not really address or

00:52:05.032 --> 00:52:13.611
seem in an obvious way to apply
to many of the financial crises

00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:18.166
that we observe.
Many of the financial crises

00:52:18.166 --> 00:52:22.364
that we observe--think of the
1987 crash or think about events

00:52:22.364 --> 00:52:26.080
in the housing market or
mortgage market today--involve

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.219
freely traded assets;
they don't involve banks;

00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:33.869
they don't seem to involve bank
runs.

00:52:33.869 --> 00:52:40.406
What I'd like to suggest--and I
can only suggest this in an

00:52:40.406 --> 00:52:47.167
imprecise way--is that in an
important sense there is a broad

00:52:47.167 --> 00:52:53.929
class of behavior that goes on
in speculative markets that is

00:52:53.929 --> 00:53:01.480
in its character very similar to
the character of a bank run.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:10.789
One way of thinking about that
bank run is to think about the

00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:19.943
value that you associate with a
deposit claim on the bank in

00:53:19.943 --> 00:53:23.738
question.
There's this troubled--there's

00:53:23.738 --> 00:53:25.506
this bank;
in normal times,

00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:29.385
I have a one dollar deposit.
The deposit is worth one

00:53:29.385 --> 00:53:33.172
dollar--have a one dollar
deposit that's worth one

00:53:33.172 --> 00:53:38.474
dollar--that's easy.
Now, imagine that the price of

00:53:38.474 --> 00:53:45.757
that deposit falls because there
comes to be a question whether

00:53:45.757 --> 00:53:52.922
that bank is going to succeed or
whether that bank is going to

00:53:52.922 --> 00:53:56.452
fail or,
for that matter,

00:53:56.452 --> 00:54:03.585
that the price of that claim
falls because of doubts about

00:54:03.585 --> 00:54:09.116
the solvency of the bank.
Do I, as a depositor,

00:54:09.116 --> 00:54:14.905
wish to put more deposits into
the bank because the price has

00:54:14.905 --> 00:54:19.889
fallen?
Or do I wish to sell my claim

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:25.650
as rapidly as I can?
Think about it for a minute.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:31.553
The situations in which the
values of deposits are falling

00:54:31.553 --> 00:54:38.182
are the very situations in which
you are most eager to sell those

00:54:38.182 --> 00:54:44.278
deposits back to the bank.
To go back to economics'

00:54:44.278 --> 00:54:50.878
standby, the most basic idea
that we teach freshmen in

00:54:50.878 --> 00:54:57.976
economics is the law of supply
and demand--the stabilizing

00:54:57.976 --> 00:55:06.070
nature of markets--markets as a
negative feedback mechanism.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.250
We tell the story in lots of
ways;

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:19.415
there's a surplus of apples;
when there's a surplus of

00:55:19.415 --> 00:55:26.366
apples, the price falls,
and then demand increases,

00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:33.039
then there isn't a surplus of
apples anymore.

00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:38.491
There's a shortage of apples,
the price rises and then there

00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:41.909
isn't a shortage of apples
anymore.

00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:46.177
Our basic image of the economic
system is as a

00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:51.677
self-equilibrating system with a
single equilibrium that is

00:55:51.677 --> 00:55:56.230
determined by that law of supply
and demand.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:56:06.761
If the demand curve slopes in
the wrong way--if a falling

00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:14.639
price leads to less demand or,
equivalently,

00:56:14.639 --> 00:56:22.789
to more supply--then none of
our normal intuitions work.

00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:30.852
Price falls in response to
excess demand and rises in

00:56:30.852 --> 00:56:38.760
response to excess supply,
magnifying the excess.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:43.460
If there's a single
equilibrium, it can be unstable.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:49.981
If the demand curve has the
more exotic shape that goes with

00:56:49.981 --> 00:56:56.391
some people responding to price
over some range by reducing

00:56:56.391 --> 00:57:02.360
demand and others responding by
increasing demand;

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.409
and there are other
possibilities.

00:57:04.409 --> 00:57:09.276
I draw here a diagram that's
been produced many times,

00:57:09.276 --> 00:57:13.737
in many different contexts,
where you engage in the

00:57:13.737 --> 00:57:17.410
intellectual exercise of--this
is complicated;

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.230
this is wild;
this is really crazy.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:22.214
Let's think of a reason why the
demand curve could have both

00:57:22.214 --> 00:57:24.277
slopes.
Let's suppose that sometimes

00:57:24.277 --> 00:57:27.550
there's the normal slope and
sometimes it has the other.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.968
Then, if it fits together in
the right way,

00:57:30.968 --> 00:57:34.548
there can be two
equilibria--one good and one

00:57:34.548 --> 00:57:38.579
bad.
One could clearly proliferate

00:57:38.579 --> 00:57:46.116
examples of this kind.
If there is a mechanism present

00:57:46.116 --> 00:57:54.888
more generally in financial
markets that causes the price

00:57:54.888 --> 00:58:04.287
of--the demand for financial
assets to increase with price or

00:58:04.287 --> 00:58:13.373
to decrease with supply or
to--or causes demand to decrease

00:58:13.373 --> 00:58:19.996
as price falls,
then one has the possibility of

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:26.349
instability that has very much
the character of the bank run.

00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:37.570
Is this a reasonable hypothesis
to maintain?

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:43.979
This brings us,
and I will not dwell on this at

00:58:43.979 --> 00:58:51.085
any length, to a broad set of
issues associated with

00:58:51.085 --> 00:58:55.744
behavioral finance.
Like Bob Shiller,

00:58:55.744 --> 00:59:00.194
I was very struck when I
encountered the assertion of

00:59:00.194 --> 00:59:05.156
Mike Jensen and others in the
late 1970s that the efficient

00:59:05.156 --> 00:59:09.691
market hypothesis was the
best-established fact in the

00:59:09.691 --> 00:59:13.816
social sciences.
By the way, that didn't

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:18.693
necessarily mean that it was a
well established fact,

00:59:18.693 --> 00:59:23.570
but as Jensen used the term
that was its meaning.

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:26.985
I have to say that as I make
that remark about social

00:59:26.985 --> 00:59:30.531
sciences, I'm reminded of the
observation somebody once

00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:33.750
offered--that if you have to
call it science,

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:40.052
it isn't--cognitive science,
Christian science,

00:59:40.052 --> 00:59:47.039
political science,
social science--and so I have,

00:59:47.039 --> 00:59:53.747
ever since hearing that,
never used the term economic

00:59:53.747 --> 00:59:58.519
science to refer to any
phenomenon.

00:59:58.519 --> 01:00:05.030
These issues were crystallized
for me.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:11.898
I had followed Bob's work on
excess volatility and tried to

01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:19.239
contribute some of my own on the
power of statistical tests.

01:00:19.239 --> 01:00:24.409
I was struck by the bitterness
of the controversies that

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:28.639
surrounded Bob's work on excess
volatility.

01:00:28.639 --> 01:00:32.388
In particular,
where so many in finance seemed

01:00:32.388 --> 01:00:36.886
to regard attacks on the
efficient market hypothesis in

01:00:36.886 --> 01:00:41.800
rather the way they would regard
attacks on their spouses or

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.514
children,
and called for not just a

01:00:45.514 --> 01:00:49.555
rational rejoinder,
but some effort at the

01:00:49.555 --> 01:00:56.237
destruction of the assailant.
I remember that my sense of the

01:00:56.237 --> 01:01:02.039
issue and the merits,
where my sympathies had always

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:06.932
been with Bob,
crystallized in the summer of

01:01:06.932 --> 01:01:09.563
1987.
In the summer of 1987,

01:01:09.563 --> 01:01:13.230
there was a certain set of
facts that was very clear.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:18.148
It was very clear in the summer
of 1987 that if you divided

01:01:18.148 --> 01:01:22.050
stock prices by any interesting
denominator,

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:28.248
they were at an extraordinarily
high level--earnings,

01:01:28.248 --> 01:01:31.110
dividends, sales,
GNP.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:33.468
If you were at Yale,
the value--the capital--you

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:36.328
added the debt and you divided
by the value of the capital

01:01:36.328 --> 01:01:38.073
stock.
It didn't matter,

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:41.033
all denominators;
stock prices were

01:01:41.033 --> 01:01:46.980
extraordinarily high.
Then, the question was how to

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:54.884
interpret that observation and
there were two interpretations

01:01:54.884 --> 01:01:59.498
on offering.
One was the conventional

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:05.543
interpretation that would have
seemed the only plausible

01:02:05.543 --> 01:02:11.150
interpretation to anyone who
read the newspaper,

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:16.294
which was that stocks had been
going great and a lot of people

01:02:16.294 --> 01:02:20.658
wanted to buy stock.
Therefore, they all tried to

01:02:20.658 --> 01:02:26.032
buy stock and there only was so
much stock and the price went

01:02:26.032 --> 01:02:29.638
up.
As a consequence of the price

01:02:29.638 --> 01:02:35.880
going up, it was probably true
that the return going forward

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:42.123
was going to be lower than it
had been before the price went

01:02:42.123 --> 01:02:45.989
up.
That was one interpretation.

01:02:45.989 --> 01:02:51.190
That seemed the obvious and
natural interpretation.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:56.359
The alternative interpretation
was that, for some reason,

01:02:56.359 --> 01:03:01.712
people who used to demand 8%
expected returns to buy stocks

01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:07.435
were now demand--had decided for
some reason that they'd really

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:13.619
be just--they used to demand 8%
to buy stocks given the risk,

01:03:13.619 --> 01:03:16.952
but all of a sudden for
whatever reason--and the reason

01:03:16.952 --> 01:03:20.716
was never spelled out with any
clarity--they now were happy to

01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:24.044
accept a 6% rate of return.
Therefore, all the future

01:03:24.044 --> 01:03:27.271
dividends and all the future
earnings were discounted at a

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:30.046
lower level.
There was, in a way,

01:03:30.046 --> 01:03:34.960
a simple intuition for deciding
what you believed.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.883
Did you believe that returns
were low because stock prices

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:43.071
were high?
Did you believe that stock

01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:48.202
prices were high because people
had decided they were perfectly

01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:52.438
content with low returns?
Well, it was an easy way to

01:03:52.438 --> 01:03:56.276
distinguish those hypotheses.
Bob did it at the time,

01:03:56.276 --> 01:03:59.689
which was to ask people,
what returns they were

01:03:59.689 --> 01:04:03.400
expecting--what returns they
were settling for.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.734
The answer suggested that,
if anything,

01:04:06.734 --> 01:04:11.209
they favored high returns
rather than--they expected

01:04:11.209 --> 01:04:15.070
higher returns than they had
previously,

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:18.770
not lower returns than they had
previously.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:25.306
Why do I dwell on all of this?
Because it is a first example

01:04:25.306 --> 01:04:30.249
of what I actually think are a
substantial variety of

01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:34.938
mechanisms,
all of which can produce this

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:41.539
kind of positive feedback
behavior in financial markets.

01:04:41.539 --> 01:04:48.457
The first and easiest mechanism
for understanding why there will

01:04:48.457 --> 01:04:52.300
be positive feedback behavior
or,

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.472
equivalently,
a decline in demand as price

01:04:55.472 --> 01:04:59.960
falls and an increase in price
in demand as price rises,

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.835
is the extrapolative
expectations that come from

01:05:02.835 --> 01:05:05.562
recent experiences.
One of the things I learned

01:05:05.562 --> 01:05:08.874
painfully, being involved with
managing the dollar as Secretary

01:05:08.874 --> 01:05:12.334
of the Treasury,
was there is absolutely no way,

01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:16.908
no matter how powerful you are
and no matter how clever you

01:05:16.908 --> 01:05:19.706
are,
that the dollar can be lower

01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:23.193
without falling.
It cannot happen no matter how

01:05:23.193 --> 01:05:27.368
much you want to have a falling
dollar without--a low dollar

01:05:27.368 --> 01:05:31.881
without a falling dollar.
In just the same way,

01:05:31.881 --> 01:05:38.150
a rising stock price leads to a
higher stock price.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:44.076
Therefore, if people demand
more after increases in price,

01:05:44.076 --> 01:05:48.340
they are demanding more as
price rises.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.581
That's one mechanism through
which there can be positive

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.940
feedback.
A second mechanism,

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:03.471
which Bob has put considerable
emphasis on in his writing,

01:06:03.471 --> 01:06:08.934
is social contagion.
It's people persuade other

01:06:08.934 --> 01:06:10.829
people;
people look at other people.

01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:16.722
Basically, the bubble
psychology takes hold as a

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:23.366
social dynamic not necessarily
related to any rational

01:06:23.366 --> 01:06:29.510
assessment of the future
behavior of markets.

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:38.019
A third mechanism is one that
can easily be given rational

01:06:38.019 --> 01:06:42.210
explanation.
I am the risk manager;

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:46.248
John is a trader.
I don't actually know whether

01:06:46.248 --> 01:06:49.436
John knows anything or not;
he says he does,

01:06:49.436 --> 01:06:54.171
but he's got a complicated
story and I can't quite tell how

01:06:54.171 --> 01:06:59.530
much he knows.
He just lost a lot of money.

01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:06.243
Should I have more confidence
in John or should I have less

01:07:06.243 --> 01:07:10.988
confidence in John,
knowing that he lost a

01:07:10.988 --> 01:07:15.849
lot--that he just lost a lot of
money?

01:07:15.849 --> 01:07:21.250
Probably, I should have less
confidence in John.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:28.920
As an empirical proposition,
his risk manager will have less

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:34.125
confidence in John.
So, positions that do not

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:39.077
succeed have less capital
associated with them than

01:07:39.077 --> 01:07:46.363
positions that do succeed,
again creating this kind of

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:54.541
positive feedback.
A fourth mechanism that will

01:07:54.541 --> 01:08:05.590
create this kind of positive
feedback derives from leverage.

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:12.641
Anyone who buys on margin or
any financial institution that

01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:18.720
has a capital requirement--when
they lose money,

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:28.412
there is a margin call or a
need to generate capital,

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:38.290
which can lead to--that can
lead to the liquidation of

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:44.590
positions;
again, falling price,

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:52.011
more selling.
A fifth example and a fifth

01:08:52.011 --> 01:09:02.668
source of positive feedback
comes from what one might think

01:09:02.668 --> 01:09:09.562
of as model uncertainty.
There are different ways to

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.499
tell the story and I suspect it
could be given much more

01:09:13.499 --> 01:09:17.579
rigorous formalization than I'm
going to attempt here.

01:09:17.579 --> 01:09:22.019
A prominent macroeconomist,
early in his career,

01:09:22.019 --> 01:09:27.781
developed on the basis of some
macroeconomic model that he had

01:09:27.781 --> 01:09:33.354
an extremely strong view that
the British pound was going to

01:09:33.354 --> 01:09:37.525
depreciate.
With great excitement,

01:09:37.525 --> 01:09:42.890
he found an older colleague who
had a broker;

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:50.745
called the broker and explained
that he wished to place an order

01:09:50.745 --> 01:09:56.729
in the futures market to sell
the pound short.

01:09:56.729 --> 01:10:04.020
The broker said,
okay I've got your order.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.600
What would you like your
stop-loss to be?

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:15.989
The young macroeconomist said,
what's that?

01:10:15.989 --> 01:10:21.247
The broker explained that it
was normal that when you placed

01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:25.970
a position, in case the position
moved against you,

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.819
since you didn't want to lose
too much money and if the

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:32.059
position moved against you,
it might signal that you didn't

01:10:32.059 --> 01:10:35.367
understand this--things weren't
playing out according to your

01:10:35.367 --> 01:10:38.180
theory of the case--that you
might want to sell.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.329
The macroeconomist said,
hell no.

01:10:41.329 --> 01:10:47.600
If it goes up 5%,
I want to buy a lot more.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.421
The young macroeconomist did
not have--went on to have a very

01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:54.159
distinguished career as a
macroeconomist,

01:10:54.159 --> 01:11:01.220
but a rather less distinguished
career as a speculator.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.406
If I asked you,
in what way would you like to

01:11:06.406 --> 01:11:10.649
place a--you have some
conviction.

01:11:10.649 --> 01:11:14.019
You've got some idea that the
Yen is going to up--that the Yen

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:17.444
is going to go down--something,
let's suppose it's that the Yen

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:21.330
is going to go up.
I say, would you rather buy

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:27.562
Yen, take your chances that the
Yen might go up or the Yen might

01:11:27.562 --> 01:11:33.199
go down, or would you rather buy
an option on the Yen?

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:36.643
If you buy an option on the
Yen, then there's no way,

01:11:36.643 --> 01:11:40.219
no matter what happens,
that you can lose more than the

01:11:40.219 --> 01:11:42.670
amount that you paid for the
Yen.

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:48.205
You can get very substantial
leverage on the option if you

01:11:48.205 --> 01:11:53.032
buy an out-of-the-money option;
you can pay only a very little

01:11:53.032 --> 01:11:55.177
bit of money.
If the Yen goes up,

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:59.339
you will multiply your initial
stake by a very substantial

01:11:59.339 --> 01:12:02.569
amount.
Most people presented with that

01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:06.682
choice, if they believe the
option is priced fairly,

01:12:06.682 --> 01:12:11.293
choose to buy the option.
But if you think about what

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:16.436
that means, that is a decision
to pursue a positive feedback

01:12:16.436 --> 01:12:20.490
trading strategy.
That is a decision that the

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:25.710
more the position moves in your
favor, the more your option is

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:30.228
in-the-money,
and the larger is your exposure

01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:35.510
to the underlying stock or the
underlying currency.

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:40.822
Anyone who chooses to use
options as a trading vehicle is

01:12:40.822 --> 01:12:46.420
choosing an approach in which
they are going to increase the

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:52.207
magnitude of their position as
the price rises or decrease the

01:12:52.207 --> 01:12:57.899
magnitude of their position as
the price falls--again,

01:12:57.899 --> 01:13:05.479
exactly the opposite of the
natural, stabilizing response.

01:13:05.479 --> 01:13:14.106
A final source of this kind of
positive feedback is the

01:13:14.106 --> 01:13:22.254
prospect that increases in
movement for any of these

01:13:22.254 --> 01:13:31.040
reasons are jumped on by those
who simply anticipate the

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:37.909
positive feedback behavior of
others.

01:13:37.909 --> 01:13:44.243
Therefore, trends follow in an
effort to front run others who

01:13:44.243 --> 01:13:50.568
are generating these trends.
I would suggest to you that

01:13:50.568 --> 01:13:55.715
consideration of these
mechanisms, along with

01:13:55.715 --> 01:14:03.084
consideration of the experience
in markets--a basic pattern that

01:14:03.084 --> 01:14:08.348
we tend to observe in
markets--positive serial

01:14:08.348 --> 01:14:16.563
correlation in the short run,
mean reversion in the long

01:14:16.563 --> 01:14:25.030
run--suggests the pervasiveness
of this kind of positive

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:31.708
feedback behavior and,
therefore, suggests the

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:38.595
likelihood that financial
markets will be subject to very

01:14:38.595 --> 01:14:44.989
substantial instability and
multiple equilibrium.

01:14:44.989 --> 01:14:52.228
Just as the positive feedback
associated with the bank run

01:14:52.228 --> 01:15:00.609
makes a case for--or least opens
up a case--for activist policy,

01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:05.235
so also, in the case of
financial markets,

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:11.778
the possibility of downdrafts
caused by falling prices that

01:15:11.778 --> 01:15:18.321
lead to selling--that lead to
more selling--lead to falling

01:15:18.321 --> 01:15:25.090
prices--or updrafts caused by
the opposite mechanisms,

01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:34.703
make a potentially strong case
for government action to contain

01:15:34.703 --> 01:15:41.513
financial crisis.
So far, I've tried to make the

01:15:41.513 --> 01:15:48.981
case that I want to make for
today--that the macroeconomics

01:15:48.981 --> 01:15:56.321
of the next generation will be
much more about finance and

01:15:56.321 --> 01:16:02.245
financial crisis than the
macroeconomics of the

01:16:02.245 --> 01:16:08.039
generations that shaped our
textbooks;

01:16:08.039 --> 01:16:14.932
that the social gains from
preventing and containing

01:16:14.932 --> 01:16:21.420
financial crises are likely to
be significant.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:27.455
And offer the prospect of
achieving the deep-seated goal

01:16:27.455 --> 01:16:31.076
of every Keynesian
macroeconomist:

01:16:31.076 --> 01:16:37.770
reducing the average output gap
over a long period of time and

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:42.380
thereby producing more total
output.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:50.675
That a realistic theory of
financial crisis has to be based

01:16:50.675 --> 01:16:59.829
on something other than the idea
that the market is efficient.

01:16:59.829 --> 01:17:05.582
And that the notion that bank
run-like behavior can be

01:17:05.582 --> 01:17:11.985
generated out of the behavior of
speculative participants in

01:17:11.985 --> 01:17:16.869
financial markets who respond
perversely,

01:17:16.869 --> 01:17:22.796
from an economist's point of
view, to price signals,

01:17:22.796 --> 01:17:28.843
is a highly plausible one.
Tomorrow, I hope to illustrate

01:17:28.843 --> 01:17:33.872
that these broad ideas have
connection with the current

01:17:33.872 --> 01:17:38.248
financial crisis that we face
and to suggest--to

01:17:38.248 --> 01:17:42.997
evaluate--some of the policy
measures that have been

01:17:42.997 --> 01:17:49.330
undertaken and to suggest some
policy actions for the future.

01:17:49.330 --> 01:18:01.840
Thank you very much.
Bob, I don't know what the

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.050
format here is,
but I'd be happy to answer a

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:08.020
few questions.
Yes, sir?

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.219
Student: If the
government seeks to stabilize

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:14.543
this plan of avoiding these
perverse positive feedback

01:18:14.543 --> 01:18:18.126
consequences,
doesn't that very government

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:22.260
action itself make for this very
possibility?

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.685
Does the government continue
doing that and,

01:18:24.685 --> 01:18:27.449
therefore, it gets to a point
where it says no,

01:18:27.449 --> 01:18:31.406
it will have created its own
positive feedback mechanism

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:35.384
reverse itself?
Professor Larry Summers:

01:18:35.384 --> 01:18:40.625
I had a conclusion addressed to
the word moral hazard that I

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:45.956
decided to defer to the first
part of what I was going to say

01:18:45.956 --> 01:18:50.643
tomorrow.
But, since you ask essentially

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:55.350
the question,
I'll address it right now.

01:18:55.350 --> 01:19:00.507
I chose, in summarizing the
main points, to use the

01:19:00.507 --> 01:19:06.284
phrase--this possibility of
positive feedback--open space

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:12.061
for constructive government
action precisely so as to not

01:19:12.061 --> 01:19:17.631
judge with absolutism that in
every case there would be

01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:22.479
desirable things for governments
to do,

01:19:22.479 --> 01:19:27.813
precisely because of the
expectational effects that you

01:19:27.813 --> 01:19:31.316
describe.
It seems to me that before

01:19:31.316 --> 01:19:36.336
embracing moral hazard
fundamentalism and the idea that

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:40.536
if the government gets involved,
then there will be expectations

01:19:40.536 --> 01:19:42.399
of the government doing things,
and then if their expectations

01:19:42.399 --> 01:19:43.560
that the government's doing
things,

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.883
people will respond to those
expectations and then it'll

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:50.005
surely be bad.
Before embracing that idea,

01:19:50.005 --> 01:19:53.039
one needs to pause over three
points.

01:19:53.039 --> 01:20:00.733
First, moral hazard is not a
reason why there should not be

01:20:00.733 --> 01:20:08.293
insurance or a reason why
problems should not be addressed

01:20:08.293 --> 01:20:13.771
by collective action.
The standard wise crack on the

01:20:13.771 --> 01:20:17.662
subject is: the fact that I
smoke in bed is not usually

01:20:17.662 --> 01:20:22.130
considered a good reason for the
fire department not to come to

01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:27.466
my house to put out the fire,
especially if my house borders

01:20:27.466 --> 01:20:31.699
very closely on many other
people's houses.

01:20:31.699 --> 01:20:34.757
The first point is,
yes there may be adverse

01:20:34.757 --> 01:20:38.668
effects that come from the
expectations and there may be

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:42.650
beneficial effects that come
from the direct action;

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:48.213
those have to be traded off.
Second, there is a certain

01:20:48.213 --> 01:20:54.852
sloppiness in supposing that all
induced behavioral changes are

01:20:54.852 --> 01:21:01.172
to be thought of as undesirable.
Consider a standard bit of

01:21:01.172 --> 01:21:07.010
public policy--the placing of
guard rails beside highways.

01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:11.582
The government chooses,
as part of the provision of a

01:21:11.582 --> 01:21:16.418
public good, to place guard
rails beside highways and to

01:21:16.418 --> 01:21:20.199
place good guard rails beside
highways.

01:21:20.199 --> 01:21:23.527
It is a documented,
empirical fact that as a

01:21:23.527 --> 01:21:27.241
consequence of the presence of
those guard rails,

01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:31.109
people drive faster than they
otherwise would.

01:21:31.109 --> 01:21:34.896
How should one think about,
as an economist,

01:21:34.896 --> 01:21:37.890
the fact that they drive
faster?

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:43.142
As in doing a welfare
evaluation of guard rails,

01:21:43.142 --> 01:21:49.400
I think a moment's thought
should convince you that since

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:56.217
they had the option of driving
at the same speed that they did

01:21:56.217 --> 01:22:00.080
before,
in the presence of the guard

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.180
rails they adjusted their
behavior.

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:10.085
The welfare gain from building
the guard rails is greater than

01:22:10.085 --> 01:22:16.764
it would have been if people--is
magnified by the behavioral

01:22:16.764 --> 01:22:21.956
response that takes place.
If people decide,

01:22:21.956 --> 01:22:26.184
for example,
that because we have deposit

01:22:26.184 --> 01:22:32.736
insurance they are not going to
check on the expressions of the

01:22:32.736 --> 01:22:37.069
bank tellers at their bank
everyday,

01:22:37.069 --> 01:22:42.949
that I would argue is an
induced behavioral response from

01:22:42.949 --> 01:22:48.616
a public intervention,
but it is one that magnifies

01:22:48.616 --> 01:22:55.358
the gain from deposit insurance
rather than reducing the gain

01:22:55.358 --> 01:23:01.773
from deposit insurance.
The third point to be

01:23:01.773 --> 01:23:12.420
considered, and it's getting a
bit ahead of our story tomorrow,

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:20.116
is that there is no--is that
one has to very carefully

01:23:20.116 --> 01:23:27.377
consider the cost to the
government of contemplated

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:33.054
actions.
People talk about bailouts in a

01:23:33.054 --> 01:23:39.654
rather indiscriminate way,
but it is a very different

01:23:39.654 --> 01:23:48.853
thing for me to loan my friend,
John, $1,000 than for me to

01:23:48.853 --> 01:23:54.279
give my friend,
John, $1,000.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:24:00.437
If I loan my friend,
John, $1,000 at a premium

01:24:00.437 --> 01:24:08.100
interest rate that exceeds the
cost at which I borrow,

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:16.503
it may even be profitable for
me to lend money to my friend,

01:24:16.503 --> 01:24:20.926
John.
If I am making a profit,

01:24:20.926 --> 01:24:29.351
the question of in what sense I
am subsidizing him becomes a

01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:34.920
rather--becomes a rather subtle
one.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:43.542
So, take as a concrete example
that poses the issue:

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:53.180
the loan that the United States
made to Mexico in 1995.

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:59.303
The loan that the United States
made to Mexico came at a premium

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:03.191
of, let's say,
on average about 200 basis

01:25:03.191 --> 01:25:07.760
points over the Treasury's
borrowing costs.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.222
At the time the United States
made it, Mexico would have

01:25:12.222 --> 01:25:17.252
probably been unable to borrow
at any interest rate below 1,000

01:25:17.252 --> 01:25:21.470
basis points and perhaps would
have been unable--more

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:25.121
realistically,
probably would have been unable

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:29.557
to borrow at all.
So, how does one think about

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:33.015
that 200 basis-point loan?
One way to think about it is,

01:25:33.015 --> 01:25:35.479
we made a profit;
200 is more than 0.

01:25:35.479 --> 01:25:40.562
Another way to think about is,
well wait, the market price of

01:25:40.562 --> 01:25:44.119
a loan to Mexico was 1,000 basis
points;

01:25:44.119 --> 01:25:48.254
we made the loan at 200 basis
points, therefore the loan is

01:25:48.254 --> 01:25:50.750
under water in the first
instant.

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:56.451
Another way to think about it
is, well the market price is 200

01:25:56.451 --> 01:26:00.657
basis--the market price is 1,000
basis points,

01:26:00.657 --> 01:26:06.264
but that's assuming that it's
Citibank trying to collect from

01:26:06.264 --> 01:26:09.536
Mexico.
Probably the United States is

01:26:09.536 --> 01:26:13.366
going to be much better at
collecting from Mexico for a

01:26:13.366 --> 01:26:15.989
variety of reasons than
Citigroup,

01:26:15.989 --> 01:26:21.073
just as the Fed is going to be
much better at collecting from

01:26:21.073 --> 01:26:27.475
Merrill Lynch than most others.
There's considerable subtlety

01:26:27.475 --> 01:26:34.188
involved in judging whether
lending activity at premium

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:41.149
interest rates does or does not
constitute a subsidy.

01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:44.004
Almost always,
it will be profitable if paid

01:26:44.004 --> 01:26:47.189
back relative to the lender's
borrowing costs.

01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:52.159
Almost always,
it will be at an interest rate

01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:59.500
that is lower than the borrower
could borrow at on the markets.

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.843
And almost always,
in the case of public or

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:06.665
quasi-public activity,
there will be a reasonable

01:27:06.665 --> 01:27:11.124
argument that the lender is
better at collecting than the

01:27:11.124 --> 01:27:16.873
private sector would have been.
So, the question of evaluating

01:27:16.873 --> 01:27:21.280
subsidy is difficult.
The position that I always took

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.449
as Secretary of the Treasury,
with respect to the IMF,

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:30.058
was, look we've got a long
experience and over time our

01:27:30.058 --> 01:27:34.239
loans have been paid back and
we've made money;

01:27:34.239 --> 01:27:39.659
so, you can't really think of
this as bailout and subsidy.

01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:42.060
I think it was a pretty strong
argument.

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:46.900
I would want to resist in the
strongest terms the idea that

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.574
because government involvement
will affect private sector

01:27:51.574 --> 01:27:55.629
behavior,
there is to be some presumption

01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:58.120
that it is to be avoided.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:19.715
Yes?
Student: Why didn't

01:28:19.715 --> 01:28:40.069
people see these defaults
coming?

01:28:40.069 --> 01:28:50.380
Professor Larry Summers:
The world is a very uncertain

01:28:50.380 --> 01:29:00.689
place and default risks are
very, very difficult to judge.

01:29:00.689 --> 01:29:05.848
It's far from clear that,
as a general matter,

01:29:05.848 --> 01:29:10.090
investors understate default
risks.

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:14.400
Indeed, I think most people who
look closely at pricing patterns

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.000
in bond markets would tell you
that,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.315
if anything,
investors systematically

01:29:20.315 --> 01:29:25.309
overstate default risks.
So, on a very consistent basis,

01:29:25.309 --> 01:29:29.250
if you buy riskier bonds and
sell safer bonds,

01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:34.493
that on average proves to be a
profitable strategy and even

01:29:34.493 --> 01:29:39.104
proves to be a profitable
strategy adjusting for the

01:29:39.104 --> 01:29:42.539
degree of risk that you're
taking.

01:29:42.539 --> 01:29:48.414
The premise of policy has
tended to be a great deal of

01:29:48.414 --> 01:29:55.397
emphasis on transparency in the
hope that with more transparency

01:29:55.397 --> 01:30:01.376
and better information,
investors will make more

01:30:01.376 --> 01:30:08.966
rational decisions and will make
more rational decisions ex

01:30:08.966 --> 01:30:12.538
ante.
There are also sets of issues

01:30:12.538 --> 01:30:16.552
that are involved here--and I'll
say something about this

01:30:16.552 --> 01:30:20.996
tomorrow--having to do with the
fact that the optimal number of

01:30:20.996 --> 01:30:26.406
auto accidents is not zero.
The optimal number of plane

01:30:26.406 --> 01:30:31.512
crashes is not zero.
There is a trade off to be made

01:30:31.512 --> 01:30:36.444
between accepting a certain
possibility of accidents and a

01:30:36.444 --> 01:30:41.895
variety of advantages that come
from the conservation of capital

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:47.260
and the making available of
finance in a variety of ways.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.660
Thank you very much.

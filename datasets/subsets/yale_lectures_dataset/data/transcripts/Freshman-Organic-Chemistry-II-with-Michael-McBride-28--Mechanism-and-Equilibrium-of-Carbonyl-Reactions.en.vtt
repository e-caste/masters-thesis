00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:04.000
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So we've
started talking about the

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.167
mechanism about
carbonyl chemistry.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.333
We'll talk today about addition
to carbonyl, the 

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.800
mechanism, and the equilibrium
constant. 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.300
About protecting groups, a
little bit of NMR review at 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.433
the end if we have time. 

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.500
And if we really have time, a
little bit about the next 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.467
topic, which is oxidation and
reduction as it involves

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:28.100
carbonyl groups and
electron transfers.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.167
So last time we took an overview
of basic carbonyl 

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.367
reactivity. 

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.667
That you have addition. 

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.767
You can have addition where the
nucleophile attacks, 

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.900
that's the old Burgi-Dunitz
story. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.433
And then the acid A comes on to
oxygen and you complete it. 

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.167
Or you can do it the other
direction. 

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:52.700
You can start with the acid
protonating the oxygen first. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.767
Or whatever acid it is. 

00:00:54.767 --> 00:01:00.300
And then to give an oxygen
cation that's stabilized by 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.800
the double bond. You can a draw
resonance structure with plus 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.700
on carbon and the nucleophile
comes in. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.367
So there are two ways of doing
it. 

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:11.500
Initially with a nucleophile,
initially with an acid. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.533
And we saw that if you have an
alpha hydrogen, then it's 

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.700
possible to pull it off with
base to make an enolate and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700
put it on-- 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.033
back on the oxygen. 

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.100
So that's-- 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.600
you can do an allylic
rearrangement to an enol. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200
It can be base-catalyzed, by the
enolate. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.133
It also could be acid-catalyzed.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.533
You could first put the proton
on the oxygen and take it off 

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.800
the alpha carbon. 

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:45.067
You can also, because of having
that functionality, 

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:49.167
enolate anion at the alpha
carbon, or the double bond of 

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.567
the enol, you can also do alpha
substitution. 

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.067
So we'll see examples of that. 

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:57.733
And if you have a leaving group,
the thing is called an 

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.600
acid derivative, right? 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.267
And you can replace it by a
nucleophile, by-- 

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:05.767
in the two-step reaction, first
add to the carbonyl then 

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.067
remove the nucleophile. 

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:12.233
So nucleophilic substitution of
acid derivatives. 

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:16.967
And in the case of carboxylic
acids you can have 

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:18.100
addition, of course. 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.767
just as we did before. 

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.333
You can have substitution at
carbon, where you make a 

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.400
new carbon-oxygen bond. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.533
Or you can have substitution at
oxygen, where you make a 

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.767
new O-R bond. 

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.233
And again, if you have an alpha
carbon it's possible to 

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.333
do substitution at the alpha
carbon. 

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.500
And we'll see examples of that.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.267
Now, one particular example is
what's called Fischer 

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.933
esterification which was
invented, you'll not be 

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.000
surprised to hear, by Emil
Fischer. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it's substitution at carbon
of a carboxylic acid to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.533
convert it into an ester. 

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:58.033
And it's acid-catalyzed. 

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.733
So let's think about how this
works. 

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:03.067
Where's the acid going to come
in and protonate this? 

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:03.367
Karl? 

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:04.100
STUDENT: At the oxygen. 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800
PROFESSOR: There are two
oxygens. 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.100
STUDENT: Oh. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.567
The oxygen that's connected by
the single bond. 

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:10.433
PROFESSOR: How do you know? 

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.333
Why should it do that one? why
not the other? 

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.667
STUDENT: Because water's a good
leaving group, and so 

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.100
that O just put the H...or you
put the proton on-- 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.100
PROFESSOR: I'm not asking what's
a good leaving group. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.133
I'm asking where the best place
to protonate is. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.633
STUDENT: Um, from-- that O has--

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:36.067
that O has the unshared pairs. 

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:37.867
PROFESSOR: How about the oxygen
on top? 

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:41.867
STUDENT: That also has unshared
pairs, so-- 

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:47.300
PROFESSOR: Let's look at what
would happen, if you brought 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.000
the proton in on top. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.267
You'd get that cation. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.100
Anything good about that one
that you can't have if you 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.500
protonate the bottom one? 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.367
Anybody see? 

00:03:59.367 --> 00:03:59.833
Debbie? 

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:00.833
STUDENT: Resonance? 

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:02.700
PROFESSOR: You can get resonance

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.000
stabilization of that one. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.300
Why protonate this one instead
of that one? 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.400
Well notice in the starting-- 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.900
that this unshared pair is
stabilized by that. 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.433
By the low LUMO next door, so
that makes it a little harder 

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.033
to protonate, right? 

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:22.567
On the other hand, the one
that's up here is-- 

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.400
it could be a lower-energy one,
if it were in those 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.667
rabbit-ear sp square orbitals. 

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.600
So that would suggest that this
one 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.167
might be better, right? 

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.467
But it's killed by that. 

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:35.833
And when you protonate-- 

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:40.367
but notice the stability you get
there gets even more so 

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.967
when you protonate on the top. 

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:45.867
Whatever stabilization you had
of this unshared pair before 

00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:48.700
you protonated it, you have more
now because you have a 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.233
lower LUMO to stabilize it. 

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:54.433
So you get that special
stabilization, which you can 

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:58.267
draw by a resonance structure,
that resonance structure. 

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:01.800
So you in fact protonate the
top, not the bottom. 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.567
OK? 

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:06.233
So once you've done that then
you can bring in an alcohol 

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:07.367
and attack the carbon. 

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:09.067
It's going to be easy to attack
now, 

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:10.833
since a very low LUMO. 

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:11.900
And then lose-- 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.167
so you get a tetrahedral
intermediate. 

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:16.200
You started with a trigonal
carbon, three 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.633
atoms attached to it. 

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.300
Now there are four. It's a
tetrahedral intermediate. 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.700
So notice that as opposed to SN2
substitution, this one 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.267
first does an addition, 

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:29.867
and then loses the leaving
group. 

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:33.167
They're not both happening at
the same time. 

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.267
In that sense it's analogous the
nucleophilic 

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:37.933
aromatic substitution. 

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.567
Here's a nucleophile that comes
in, forms a 

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:44.900
tetracoordinated carbon, and
then this one is going to 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.100
leave. Here the amine came in,
formed a tetracoordinated 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.800
carbon, from the one that had
only three things when the 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.967
fluorine was down here. 

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:57.667
And now this is strictly
analogous to that. 

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:02.133
What we do next is lose a proton
from here, and then 

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:03.967
lose the flouride. 

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:06.667
Here we're going to lose a
proton from here 

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.067
and then lose hydroxide. 

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:10.333
So we lose the proton-- 

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:13.667
now, of course there's an easier
way than losing 

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.500
hydroxide directly. 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.467
Now you can do what you want to
do, Karl. 

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.300
STUDENT: Bring on the protons to
that oxygen. 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.967
PROFESSOR: To that-- to your
favorite oxygen there. 

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.367
Now you've got the leaving
group. 

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:27.600
But the first protonation was up
here and you went through 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.300
that tetrahedral intermediate. 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.300
It wasn't the case of making
this a leaving group, and then 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.900
doing something like an SN2. 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.667
You first did an addition to the
carbonyl and then 

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.233
eliminate the water, and of
course the proton 

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:44.500
then comes off again. 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.000
So that's the mechanism of
Fischer esterification. 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And of course you can run it
either direction. 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.633
You can run it forwards or
backwards. 

00:06:55.633 --> 00:07:01.733
It's a way of replacing OR on
the acid carbon, 

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:02.933
the carbonyl carbon. 

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:08.133
And you can do it with where R
is H, as well as where R is 

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:09.467
some alkyl group. 

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:11.867
So you can go either way,
trading them back and forth. 

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:15.367
So the way you decide to get
ester, rather than getting 

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:18.267
acid, which way are you going to
go, is to have a lot more 

00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:19.967
alcohol than water there. 

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.200
So you drive the equilibrium one
way. 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.000
If you turn it around and have a
lot more water than alcohol, 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.133
you'll drive it the other way. 

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:27.300
OK. 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.300
So that's Fischer
esterification. 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.833
Now Victor Meyer, we saw last
time, was the short-term 

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:36.700
supervisor of Moses Gomberg. 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.700
And remember what Gomberg did in
his lab? 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.033
He made tetraphenylmethane, 

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:47.100
which was hard to make because
it was so sterically hindered, 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.733
as we found out in trying to
make it with models last time. 

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:54.600
But in fact it was Victor Myer
who introduced the idea of 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600
steric hindrance in 1894. 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.133
He wrote, "the source of this
behavior is stereochemical, 

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:05.500
the space filling of the
neighboring groups." So this 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.933
was something else that was
added to the organic model in 

00:08:08.933 --> 00:08:10.767
the 19th century that we didn't
really 

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:12.267
discuss last time. 

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:16.433
We discussed configuration--
things involving arrangement 

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:20.267
in space-- which was van't Hoff
in 1874. 

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:22.633
We talked about strain, ring
strain. 

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:25.100
That was Baeyer, 1885. 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.100
And we talked about conformation
which Sachse 

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.267
tried, unsuccessfully, to
introduce into the 

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.433
discussion in 1891. 

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:36.333
But Meyer had the idea of steric
hindrance. 

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.933
And he said the source of this
behavior. 

00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:40.300
What was this behavior? 

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.333
What was it the basis of his
proposing steric hindrance? 

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:48.267
It was Fischer esterification in
the situation where it 

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:51.133
doesn't work. 

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:55.233
So it doesn't work for
2,6-dimethylbenzoic acid. 

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.800
When you have a methyl group
here and a methyl group here 

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.500
adjacent to that, then you can't
do Fischer 

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.733
esterification. 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.033
Now why not? 

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:09.233
You can clearly start out here
by bringing in a proton and 

00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:10.333
putting it on there. 

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.967
No problem. 

00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:14.733
Where do you get into trouble,
do you see? 

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.733
Karl, try again. 

00:09:18.733 --> 00:09:22.433
STUDENT: When you're going to
bring in the OR group, because 

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.700
it's going to have to attack
from that way. 

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.367
PROFESSOR: It's going to have to
come in from here, where 

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:27.600
this thing is. 

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.067
And you're going to try to make
that into a tetrahedral 

00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:33.900
carbon with three extra
substituants on it. 

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.867
So it's going to to have the-- 

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:40.333
it's going to have whatever just
came in, right? 

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.067
Some OR group. 

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:45.833
Plus, this one protonated and
this one protonated. 

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.867
So you've got to get all these
three things here, where 

00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:52.600
that's not an H. That's whatever
just came in. 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.567
Adjacent to these two things,
and it's quite crowded as you 

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:59.767
can see here, that there's going
to be strain involved in 

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:01.333
these things running into one
another. 

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:04.267
So you can't get to the
tetrahedral intermediate of 

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:07.167
the Fischer esterification. 

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:09.967
And this was actually the basis
of the first suggestion 

00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:13.000
that there was such a thing as
steric hindrance. 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.900
OK. 

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.433
So this tetrahedral intermediate
is hard to make 

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:20.600
if R is really big and crowded.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.300
OK? 

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.900
But there's a way to make the
ester, none the less. 

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.233
And it was invented by a guy who
sat in some of your seats. 

00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:30.867
I don't know which seats he sat
in when he was a student 

00:10:30.867 --> 00:10:32.733
here because it was a long time
ago. 

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:33.833
So we can't do that. 

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.300
We can't do Fischer
esterification that way. 

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.833
But Melvin Newman, whose picture
we showed last 

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:43.800
semester, figured out in 1941
how to do this. 

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.733
And he did it by putting the
acid into concentrated 

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:49.000
sulfuric acid. 

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:52.933
Now what happens when you put it
into 

00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:55.333
concentrated sulfuric acid? 

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:56.000
Karl? 

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.267
So you put it into concentrated
acid, it's going 

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:00.967
to protonate it. 

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:02.733
Where will it protonate it? 

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:04.967
STUDENT: On the top. 

00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:07.500
PROFESSOR: On the top, right? 

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.300
Wrong again. 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.700
No, actually you're right of
course. 

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.800
You do protonate it up. 

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.267
You put it in 100% sulfuric
acid, you do protonate it on 

00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:20.633
the top, right? 

00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:22.933
For the same reason we went
through before. 

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:25.133
But once in a while-- 

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.233
you were right originally. 

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:32.067
Once in a while, it'll protonate
on the bottom. 

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.200
The one you wanted. 

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.367
And what's good about that? 

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:35.800
STUDENT: It's a leaving group. 

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.067
PROFESSOR: It's a leaving group.

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:43.233
So in fact, that can now go
away. 

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:45.033
Now of course it could come back
again. 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.800
But, in concentrated sulfuric
acid, water is all protonated. 

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.067
And as long as it's protonated
it can't come back. 

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:01.833
It doesn't have the high HOMO. 

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:04.967
So in fact, you can make this
thing, which is called in an 

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:08.167
acylium ion. 

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:11.133
And now, what he does is take
this concentrated sulfuric 

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:15.233
acid and pour it, carefully,
into water-- 

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:18.567
or pardon me, into alcohol. 

00:12:18.567 --> 00:12:21.967
So as he pours it into alcohol
it's no longer concentrated 

00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:24.233
sulfuric acid. 

00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:25.233
So the acid-- 

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:27.900
so you won't be able to make
these things anymore. 

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.800
But alcohol rather than water is
the thing that 

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.367
will get the carbon. 

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:35.633
So then you'll-- 

00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:38.367
that inhibits the reversal, as
we just said. 

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:43.467
And you pour it into ROH and now
the OR traps it, and 

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:45.833
you'll lose a proton, and you've
made the ester. 

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.400
But notice the difference. 

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.733
Here you made it by dissociation
followed by 

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:53.500
association when it's crowded. 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.067
The normal Fishcer
esterification is association 

00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:58.833
and then dissociation. 

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:02.233
But by doing it in real strong
sulfuric acid, Newman figured 

00:13:02.233 --> 00:13:06.700
out how to do this in the very,
very hindered cases. 

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.067
OK. 

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:12.567
So now, hydration of carbonyl
groups, which can be done 

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:14.367
either acid or base. 

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:17.800
And that was a note to myself
which I forgot to take out. 

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.367
So let's talk about acid
catalyzed hydration of 

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.800
formaldehyde. 

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.733
So I want somebody to help me
out on here. 

00:13:24.733 --> 00:13:28.133
Here, down at the bottom, we
have formaldehyde and water. 

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:32.400
And what I want to do is add to
get the hydrate, as it's 

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.667
called, of the aldehyde right? 

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.067
The diol. 

00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:40.567
That's a hydrate or a gem-diol,
the two OH's on the 

00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:41.600
same carbon. 

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.933
So how do we do that? 

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:43.867
Here we have-- 

00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:47.600
it's acid catalyzed, it's
hydration, so we have water, 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.633
and it's formaldehyde. 

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:50.900
How are we going to begin here?

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.933
Amy what do you say? 

00:13:55.933 --> 00:13:57.867
STUDENT: Umm-- 

00:13:57.867 --> 00:13:59.767
PROFESSOR: It's acid catalyzed,
so 

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:00.800
what's going to happen? 

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.267
STUDENT: You're going to
protonate one of the-- 

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:08.233
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
protonate something. 

00:14:08.233 --> 00:14:09.900
So far, so good. 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.667
What are you going to protonate?

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:13.400
STUDENT: We're starting on that
side, right? 

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.200
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.467
STUDENT: We're starting on that
side, right? 

00:14:15.467 --> 00:14:16.700
PROFESSOR: We're going to
protonate. 

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.167
Where are we going to protonate
it? 

00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:19.467
STUDENT: The carbonyl group? 

00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:21.367
PROFESSOR: Where on the carbonyl
group? 

00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:22.333
Which atom? 

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:24.267
STUDENT: The O. 

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:25.000
PROFESSOR: OK, good. 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.733
So bring it down, we bring that
on, and now we have that, 

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:30.800
which is a nice stable cation,
right? 

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.500
It's a resonance stabilized. 

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.000
OK. 

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.300
What's going to happen next? 

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.333
You want to keep us going? 

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:42.700
STUDENT: Then the O on the H2O's
going to come in and 

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.900
attack the cation. 

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.367
PROFESSOR: OK, so that will come
in, attack the cation. 

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.833
So now we got that. 

00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:52.700
And finally? 

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.633
We're getting pretty close to
the product, what 

00:14:53.633 --> 00:14:54.900
do we have to do? 

00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:00.767
STUDENT: We have to deprotonate
the OH. 

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.300
PROFESSOR: Right, so you just
have to lose the proton. 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.500
And it doesn't just fly off. 

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.767
An alcohol will take it or
something. 

00:15:07.767 --> 00:15:08.100
OK. 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.000
Or water. 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.367
OK. 

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:11.967
So we've done it. 

00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:15.233
So that's acid catalyzed
hydration of formaldehyde. 

00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:20.400
Now how about base catalyzed
hydration of formaldehyde? 

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.467
Need someone to help us here. 

00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:24.567
Lauren, how about you? 

00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:26.500
So what's going to attack what?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.500
STUDENT: Well...

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.100
PROFESSOR: We've got base for a
catalyst. Notice, we got the H 

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100
plus back again here. 

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.667
It was catalytic, right? 

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.600
Came in at first, then came out
again. 

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.700
So OH minus is going to come in
at first, 

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.667
and come out again-- 

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:43.500
it's base-catalyzed-- 

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.867
and we've got water, and we've
got an aldehyde. 

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.000
What are we going to attack with
the OH? 

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.967
STUDENT: Is it going to attack
the double bond? 

00:15:48.967 --> 00:15:50.900
PROFESSOR: Where will it attack?

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.133
STUDENT: The lone pair will
attack the pi* 

00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:58.767
PROFESSOR: On which atom, O or
C? 

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:00.233
STUDENT: On the C. 

00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:01.200
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.667
STUDENT: On the C. 

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:02.600
PROFESSOR: On the C, 

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.400
right. This is our old favorite
attacking pi*. 

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.267
So that will come down there. 

00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:10.233
And now we got that. 

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:13.233
But what we need is the hydrate,

00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:14.100
the gem-diol. 

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.633
So what's going to happen next?

00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:24.000
What do we need in order to get
there? 

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.200
To get from here to here, what
atom do we need? 

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.500
STUDENT: A proton. 

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:29.933
PROFESSOR: A proton. 

00:16:29.933 --> 00:16:30.867
Where do we get it? 

00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:31.833
STUDENT: From water. 

00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:32.167
PROFESSOR: From water. 

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:33.400
It's in base, right? 

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.100
So we're not going to get it
from H plus. 

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.300
We're going to get it from
water. 

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.333
So the water will come down, do
an SN2 

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.900
type reaction at hydrogen-- 

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.400
substitution at hydrogen-- 

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.467
and we've got the product 

00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:47.533
and hydroxide which comes back
and catalyzes another one. 

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:50.433
Lives to fight another day.

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:50.733
OK. 

00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:55.233
So either acid- or
base-catalyzed schemes 

00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:56.700
will work for that. 

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.067
Now, how about independent of
which catalyst you use, there 

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:04.433
is going to be an equilibrium
constant between water plus 

00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:08.933
the aldehyde, and the diol, the
gem-diol, the hydrate. 

00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:12.333
And as luck would have it, for
acetaldehyde, the one which 

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:15.100
has CH3 and H on the carbonyl,
the 

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.867
equilibrium constant is one. 

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:20.533
And now we're going to see how
that equilibrium constant 

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:24.900
changes as we change what kind
of aldehyde or ketone we're 

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.167
dealing with. 

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:26.700
OK. 

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.600
So suppose we have formaldehyde.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.967
I want someone to predict for me
whether this equilibrium 

00:17:32.967 --> 00:17:34.667
constant is going to be greater
than one 

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:35.900
or less than one. 

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:43.500
Can anybody see any factors that
will be relevant? 

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.200
Alex, can you see a difference--
we want 

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.800
differences between this and
this, or between this and 

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.267
this, that it's going to make
one or the other more stable, 

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.167
and therefore change the
equilibrium constant. 

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:57.400
STUDENT: Well I guess the top
right one might be 

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.267
crowded by the methyl. 

00:17:58.267 --> 00:17:59.133
PROFESSOR: Aha. 

00:17:59.133 --> 00:17:59.967
That's a good point. 

00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:02.833
This angle gets smaller here,
right? 

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:08.900
So this CH3 could run into the
H. But also, the CH3 gets more 

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.267
crowded because we've got two
O's on here now. 

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:12.533
So that's a good point. 

00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:15.300
But it's the one that I've
animated second. 

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:15.567
OK. 

00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:17.400
Which way is that going to
change it? 

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.733
Is it going to make the
equilibrium constant greater or

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:20.500
less than one? 

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.800
STUDENT: It'll make the bottom
one higher than one. 

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.900
PROFESSOR: It'll make this one
less energetic than that was. 

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.733
Lower in energy, so that'll tend
to shift it to the right. 

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:32.333
OK? 

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:33.267
Any other factors? 

00:18:33.267 --> 00:18:35.267
How about anything on the left?

00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:36.533
Anybody see anything there? 

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:43.067
Between this and this. 

00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:47.333
Notice that here we have an sp
squared bond to carbon and 

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:51.233
here we have an sp squared bond
to hydrogen. 

00:18:51.233 --> 00:18:51.700
Karl? 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.467
STUDENT: Would the methyl be
more electron withdrawing? 

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:59.167
PROFESSOR: Generally electrons
consider-- 

00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:01.733
carbon is considered donating,
but that's not the factor. 

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:07.600
The strength of bond, remember
the strength of the 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.300
carbon-carbon bond depends on
hybridization. 

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.533
The strength of the
carbon-hydrogen bond depends on

00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:13.667
hybridization. 

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:16.033
But the carbon-carbon bond is
more sensitive to 

00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:19.667
hybridization, gets stronger
when you go sp squared than 

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:21.633
the carbon-hydrogen does. 

00:19:21.633 --> 00:19:28.100
So this one was a stronger bond
than that one, with 

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.667
respect to the sp squared
hybridization. 

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.333
So that made this one low. 

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:37.300
And this one was high originally
because of sterics, 

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.267
as we said. 

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:39.300
Now we've got-- 

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.067
this one is now higher, and this
one is lower. 

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:47.067
So it should shift it to the
right, and indeed, both the 

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:50.333
bond strength that we just
talked about, and the steric 

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:56.633
hindrance both suggest that it
should shift to the right. 

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:57.300
And it does. 

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.500
It's 20,000, the equilibrium
constant. 

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.300
Now let's try this way. 

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.533
Let's look at acetone. 

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:07.200
Two CH3s. 

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.067
Now what do you think? 

00:20:08.067 --> 00:20:11.000
How about on the left? 

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.200
Is this going to be better or
worse than before, than the 

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.433
ones above? 

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.133
Po-Yi. 

00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:24.300
STUDENT: As for bond strengths.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.500
PROFESSOR: It's got two of these
carbon-carbon bonds that 

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500
are especially strong. 

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.000
So this is good on the left. 

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
How about on the right? 

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.733
STUDENT: There is more steric
hindrance. 

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.333
PROFESSOR: Right, there's even
more steric hindrance. 

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.533
So that one should go to the
left from one. 

00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:42.133
And in fact it goes the other
way, right? 

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:45.633
By a factor of a thousand
roughly. 

00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:46.633
OK. 

00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:48.767
Now let's look at this. 

00:20:48.767 --> 00:20:54.500
Let's put chlorine on the methyl
group on top. 

00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.133
Now, does anybody have any ideas
about that? 

00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:06.633
So the fact of the chlorine will
change this bond. 

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:08.700
It'll also change that bond. 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.367
Because it's electron
withdrawing. 

00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:14.400
So where can it withdraw
electrons better from? 

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.400
Can it withdraw electrons better
from an sp squared or 

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.100
from an sp cubed bond? 

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.500
Where does it withdraw better? 

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.600
Cassie, you got an idea? 

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.167
Which is the more likely to
donate electrons, sp cubed or 

00:21:30.167 --> 00:21:31.467
sp squared? 

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:33.767
Which one is going to hold the
electrons tighter? 

00:21:33.767 --> 00:21:35.600
STUDENT: sp squared. 

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.133
PROFESSOR: Right, the one with
more s will hold tighter and 

00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:39.967
not be willing to give them up.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:43.133
So if chlorine wants to get
them, it's going to get them 

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:46.767
better from here than from here.

00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:49.967
So it should shift the
equilibrium in that direction. 

00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:53.500
So the electron donation-- and
it shifts it, not nearly by 

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.767
factors of a thousand, but by
a factor of 37,

00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:01.833
compared to when I had an H
instead of a chlorine. 

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.100
Now, suppose we have
three chlorines.

00:22:10.867 --> 00:22:13.533
Obviously the same direction
should happen. 

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.667
But how big should it be? 

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:16.933
Sebastian do you have an idea? 

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:24.567
If one chlorine did 37, a factor
of 37-- 

00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:30.233
so it changed the free-energy
difference enough to make a 

00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:36.100
factor of 37, what should two
more do? 

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.733
What should one more-- 

00:22:37.733 --> 00:22:39.500
suppose we just put one more in.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.233
By what factor should we
increase it do you think? 

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.567
Bear in mind that if you make
the same energy change, that 

00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:55.467
translates... because it's in an
exponent for an equilibrium, 

00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:57.033
the energy, 

00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:59.433
it's a certain factor, 

00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.767
because if you add things in
exponents it's like 

00:23:01.767 --> 00:23:04.367
multiplying things, right? 

00:23:04.367 --> 00:23:08.800
So if one changes it by 37, the
second one, if things are 

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.767
simple, would change it by a
factor of 37. 

00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:15.233
And the third would change it by
another factor of 37. 

00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:19.333
So if we go all the way from one
to three, by what factor 

00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:22.233
should we increase the
equilibrium constant? 

00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:23.700
STUDENT: 37 squared. 

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.767
PROFESSOR: 37 squared. 

00:23:25.767 --> 00:23:28.233
Is everybody me on that? 

00:23:28.233 --> 00:23:28.867
OK. 

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:33.667
Now, 37 squared is a little
bigger than 1,000, right? 

00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:36.733
And look at that it's 28,000. 

00:23:36.733 --> 00:23:40.667
That's better than we had any
reason to expect. 

00:23:40.667 --> 00:23:42.600
But it makes sense. 

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.033
And finally, what if we have
benzene as the substituant. 

00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:48.267
So benzaldehyde. 

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:52.533
Is that going to shift it right
or 

00:23:52.533 --> 00:23:54.433
left, what do you think? 

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.767
Arvind, do you have an idea? 

00:23:56.767 --> 00:23:59.800
Where will the phenyl be
stabilizing things more, on 

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.233
the right or on the left? 

00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:02.867
STUDENT: Probably on the left. 

00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:03.767
PROFESSOR: Why? 

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:05.567
STUDENT: Because there'll be
more resonance at the-- 

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:06.033
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:09.467
Because you're going to have
HOMO/LUMO interaction between 

00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:13.167
the carbonyl and the pi system
of benzene ring. 

00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:16.133
So it should shift things to the
left. 

00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:18.300
Conjugation should stabilize the
aldehyde, 

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.600
and in fact it does. 

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.100
It's a factor of 100, right? 

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.800
Instead of one, it's 0.01. 

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.433
So it shifted it to the left. 

00:24:25.433 --> 00:24:29.833
So all these make sense in terms
of what we understand of 

00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:34.100
what controls molecular energy.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:41.367
OK now, acetal formation happens
only with acids. 

00:24:41.367 --> 00:24:44.433
And I think that this is the
one. 

00:24:44.433 --> 00:24:45.333
Oh no, OK. 

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:45.833
Yeah, OK. 

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:50.833
Now, so let's look at
acid-catalyzed hemiketal

00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:52.800
formation from formaldehyde.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.200
This is closely related to a
slide that I just showed you. 

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.467
So what we have is, we want to
get from the 

00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:04.367
aldehyde to this, right? 

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:05.600
a hemiketal. 

00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:10.833
And so what we-- it's
acid-catalyzed ROH is 

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:12.000
going to add to this. 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.200
And how's it going to happen? 

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
Well let's not mess around here.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.833
Let's just go there, OK? 

00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.167
So we protonate just as we did
last time when 

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:22.333
we were adding water. 

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:27.200
Alcohol comes in, forms the
bond, bingo, we lose the 

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.967
proton, it's catalytic, and we
have the product. 

00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:35.100
OK, nobody's surprised by that.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.733
I'm doing the-- 

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:38.133
I'm belaboring this, I realize.

00:25:38.133 --> 00:25:40.733
We did the same thing last time
essentially. 

00:25:40.733 --> 00:25:43.033
Or we did the reaction going the
other direction, 

00:25:43.033 --> 00:25:44.400
now I'm going back. 

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.000
But it's really important that
you get this. 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.933
Now, base-catalyzed. 

00:25:50.933 --> 00:25:53.000
We can do this just like with
water, right? 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.900
We bring that in, attack the
pi*, get that. 

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.233
It takes a proton this time from
alcohol, 

00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:00.833
instead of from water. 

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.900
And we have the hemiketal. 

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.133
So fine. 

00:26:04.133 --> 00:26:04.700
OK. 

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.467
But suppose what we wanted to do
was get the 

00:26:06.467 --> 00:26:09.300
ketal, not the hemiketal, 

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.100
OK? 

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.800
Now, notice that that proton can
attack either oxygen. 

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.400
It could either protonate OR, in
which case what would 

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.033
happen if you then broke a bond?

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:22.400
You see which way-- where you're
going if you protonate 

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.000
OR and then break the bond
between O and C. Have alcohol 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.700
leave. Amy? 

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.300
STUDENT: Would you go back? 

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.733
PROFESSOR: You're going right
back where you started. 

00:26:32.733 --> 00:26:36.200
But you can protonate this one
as well as that one. 

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.800
So if you protonate this one and
lose water, then instead 

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.600
of reversing, you can continue.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.300
So you lose water and you get
that stable cation, 

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.633
Just like this stable cation
except it has an R on it 

00:26:50.633 --> 00:26:54.967
instead of the H. And then you
bring another alcohol in, and 

00:26:54.967 --> 00:26:57.033
do your trick, and you've got
the full ketal. 

00:26:57.033 --> 00:26:57.733
Fine. 

00:26:57.733 --> 00:26:59.500
We talked last time we went-- 

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.333
spent a lot of time going from
the ketal 

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.633
back to the carbonyl. 

00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:04.467
Now we're just going the other
direction, 

00:27:04.467 --> 00:27:05.967
reversing all of them. 

00:27:05.967 --> 00:27:08.867
Now let's try to do the same
thing with base catalysis, is 

00:27:08.867 --> 00:27:12.133
it going to work? 

00:27:12.133 --> 00:27:14.767
What's the first step going
backwards for base catalysis? 

00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:20.233
If we want to start from here
and go backwards, what's the 

00:27:20.233 --> 00:27:23.233
first thing that happens? 

00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:24.133
Linda? 

00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:25.533
STUDENT: It deprotonates. 

00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:28.533
PROFESSOR: The base will pull
off the proton, right? 

00:27:28.533 --> 00:27:33.467
Here the acid could protonate
either oxygen. 

00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:36.233
But here, when the base has to
pull off a proton, there's 

00:27:36.233 --> 00:27:37.800
only one to pull off. 

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.867
It can't pull it off from the R.
And you can't do an SN2-- 

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:46.267
pulling the R off would be like
doing an SN2 reaction, 

00:27:46.267 --> 00:27:49.500
where hydroxide attacks the R,
and this O leaves. 

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.900
But that's a terrible leaving
group. 

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.900
That's not a good one. 

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.333
So it can only take-- 

00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:56.167
so the ether-- 

00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:57.933
ethers are inert to base. 

00:27:57.933 --> 00:28:00.467
They don't under go SN2
reactions. 

00:28:00.467 --> 00:28:04.633
So it can only reverse, it can't
go on. 

00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:07.300
So you can get a ketal by acid
catalysis. 

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.733
But you can only get a hemiketal
with base catalysis. 

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:15.467
And furthermore, not only is
there no way to get the ketal, 

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:18.467
but you can't attack the ketal
with base either. 

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:22.033
Once you've got the ketal, it
won't attack with base, 

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:26.267
because you can't attack ethers
with a base. 

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:30.667
So it's the old joke, "You can't
get there from here."

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.633
Base will not do it with ketals,

00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:36.733
either making them or taking
them apart again. 

00:28:36.733 --> 00:28:37.433
OK. 

00:28:37.433 --> 00:28:41.567
Now, this relates to protecting
groups. 

00:28:41.567 --> 00:28:45.100
And I'm going to do this on the
board. 

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.067
If I were talking about pedagogy
I would say it's good 

00:28:48.067 --> 00:28:50.467
for me occasionally to draw
these things, just so you can 

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.833
see a human draw them, rather
than have them 

00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:54.133
all animated there. 

00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:58.300
But in fact I didn't have time
to do this last night. 

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.100
So there we go.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.833
So let's take this up a bit.

00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:17.067
So we're going to look at ketals
as protecting groups. 

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:17.967
Just a couple examples. 

00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:19.900
There are plenty of examples in
the book. 

00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:26.100
Now, a particularly interesting
compound is 

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:37.233
glucose, which is an aldehyde,
and an alcohol. 

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:39.733
In fact it has many alcohol
groups. 

00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:47.333
It's got OH here, OH here, OH
here, OH here. 

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:59.233
Now remember, the ketal, or
hemiketal, is formed by 

00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:03.233
reaction of an alcohol with the
aldehyde. 

00:30:03.233 --> 00:30:06.400
But now we don't have to add an
alcohol. We've got alcohols 

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.567
in there already to react with
the aldehyde. 

00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:11.367
In fact, we've got plenty of
them. 

00:30:11.367 --> 00:30:14.333
And the question is, which one?

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:18.300
Now if we were to react this
oxygen to make a ring with 

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.200
this carbon, then how many atoms
would be in the ring? 

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.900
How big a ring would it be? 

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.900
It would have the oxygen-- 

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.833
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven. 

00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:30.933
It would be a 7-membered ring. 

00:30:30.933 --> 00:30:34.533
7-membered rings are not so easy
to form because they 

00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:36.633
pucker up and things, and on
opposite sides 

00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:38.667
run into one another. 

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:40.400
So that's not so good. 

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.767
Obviously if you use this one to
attack the carbon, it would 

00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:44.800
be a 3-membered ring. 

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.400
That's bad. 

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.067
That's strain. 

00:30:46.067 --> 00:30:47.867
This one would be a 4-membered
ring. 

00:30:47.867 --> 00:30:49.933
But this one would be a
5-membered ring, 

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:50.800
that's not so bad. 

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.600
This one would be a 6-membered
ring and that's good. 

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.233
So let's see how we can do that.

00:30:55.233 --> 00:31:12.900
If we made a hemiketal, we could
have C, OH, H, COH, COH. 

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.300
I'll just draw it that way. 

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.033
COH I'll draw it that way. 

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:19.000
C, and now-- 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.733
and down here is CH2OH. 

00:31:21.733 --> 00:31:26.900
And now, this oxygen has to go
to there. 

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.267
So I could draw it this way. 

00:31:31.867 --> 00:31:34.400
But nobody thinks I'm trying to
draw what it 

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.700
actually looks like. 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.400
In fact, it's a 6-membered ring.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.500
It would look like a
cyclohexane. 

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.333
But, just for purposes of
showing what's bonded to what, 

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.233
it's often drawn that way. 

00:31:44.233 --> 00:31:44.500
OK. 

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.567
So that would be a hemiketal. 

00:31:46.567 --> 00:31:52.700
And it's 6-membered ring,
6-ring, and that thing is 

00:31:52.700 --> 00:32:00.600
called a pyranose, when it's a
6-membered ring. 

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:13.800
Now if it were this carbon, then
we would have C, H, OH, 

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.833
and we can come down here and
we'd have CH2OH, and we'd have 

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:27.267
OH here, and we'd have CH, O
coming out, O here. 

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.333
And we'd have OH and OH. 

00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:35.667
And this would be one, two,
three, four, 

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:36.900
5-membered ring. 

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:41.100
And that's called a furanose. 

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.400
OK. 

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.967
So it could go either way, and
they're reversible, too. 

00:32:55.967 --> 00:32:59.600
Because we know that with either
acid- or base-catalysis 

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.000
you can go back and forth
between hemiketals and the 

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.433
carbonyl group. 

00:33:06.433 --> 00:33:06.833
OK. 

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:10.700
Now how could you find out which
ring size it is? 

00:33:14.933 --> 00:33:20.500
Well the way it's actually done
nowadays is by NMR. But, 

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.967
in the old days, when they
didn't have NMR, they had to 

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:26.667
do chemical transformations to
figure out what was what. 

00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:27.933
So chemical degradation. 

00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:45.067
So one thing they could do would
be to treat it with acid 

00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:47.633
and alcohol, say methanol. 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.467
So acid can protonate an OH, and
then lose 

00:33:58.467 --> 00:34:01.867
water to leave a cation. 

00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:04.433
But it turns out that only one
of the-- 

00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:07.300
that one of the OH's reacts much
more 

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.033
rapidly than the others. 

00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:15.167
Which one is easy to protonate
and lose water, so as to 

00:34:15.167 --> 00:34:17.467
generate a stable cation? 

00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:18.300
OK. 

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.300
If we-- say we protonated this
one, for example. 

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.000
We'd generate a secondary
cation. 

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.700
Protonate this one, secondary
cation, this one, secondary 

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.033
cation, this one, primary
cation-- 

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:29.167
not so good. 

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:33.767
This one-- what would happen if
we protonated that one, and 

00:34:33.767 --> 00:34:36.000
lost water? 

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.733
I'll write it down below here. 

00:34:37.733 --> 00:34:48.000
So we had OH, H, this O down
here, et cetera. 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.267
Suppose I protonated this one
and lost water. 

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.300
Here is the cation I would get.

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:04.733
And then I could bring methanol
in to put the oxygen 

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:08.200
on there, lose the proton from
methanol, and I would have 

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.633
made what functional group? 

00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:12.367
If I now have O-- 

00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:16.000
instead of OH up here I have
OCH3. 

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.733
Everyone sees how I did that,
don't I? 

00:35:17.733 --> 00:35:19.400
It's the same thing we've been
doing all the time. 

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.133
You protonate, lose water, put
the alcohol on, lose proton. 

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:25.267
That replaces OH with OR. 

00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:28.133
Why did it do it there and not
do it at 

00:35:28.133 --> 00:35:30.533
all these other places? 

00:35:30.533 --> 00:35:35.067
What was specially good about
this cation that the others 

00:35:35.067 --> 00:35:36.300
didn't have? 

00:35:39.733 --> 00:35:41.700
Chris? 

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.867
Let me draw the-- 

00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:46.467
I'll draw the cation here, or
here. 

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:51.067
So the cation has an O on it, an
H on it, a 

00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:52.900
carbon on it, +. 

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.733
What's good about-- and this one
goes 

00:35:54.733 --> 00:35:56.400
down then to the bottom. 

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.400
What's good about that cation,
Chris? 

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.300
STUDENT: Secondary cation. 

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.333
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:01.300
STUDENT: Secondary cation. 

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.867
PROFESSOR: It's secondary if you
want to consider an oxygen 

00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:05.667
as if it were carbon, but so
were all 

00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:07.033
these others secondary. 

00:36:07.033 --> 00:36:07.233
Right? 

00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:09.533
If you protonated those and lost
water. 

00:36:09.533 --> 00:36:11.367
What's especially good about
this one? Matt? 

00:36:11.367 --> 00:36:15.633
STUDENT: You have an
electron-withdrawing oxygen. 

00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:17.800
PROFESSOR: Is that good to make
a cation if you have 

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.567
something that's electron
withdrawing? 

00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:22.033
That means it's already
positive. 

00:36:22.033 --> 00:36:24.000
It doesn't want to get
more positive.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.500
STUDENT: Oh. 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.600
PROFESSOR: So the electron
withdrawal by the oxygen is

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.467
going to be bad for this.

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:30.900
But there's something that
makes it good.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.300
Brandon? 

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.067
STUDENT: The lone pair mixes
with the carbon. 

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:35.167
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:36:35.167 --> 00:36:38.400
The unshared pair on the oxygen
is stabilized by this 

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.800
vacant orbital, right? 

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.567
You can draw a resonance
structure that puts 

00:36:41.567 --> 00:36:42.933
a double bond here. 

00:36:42.933 --> 00:36:45.300
And + on the oxygen. 

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:45.867
OK. 

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:50.300
So this one is the one that's
reactive to make a ketal. 

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.467
This thing is a ketal. 

00:36:51.467 --> 00:36:54.733
It's got two OR groups on it. 

00:36:54.733 --> 00:36:57.900
And that one we could make a
ketal too, up here of course, 

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.467
and not the other places. 

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:02.100
So we can make a ketal, right? 

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.167
Now, it's possible under those
circumstances to do reactions 

00:37:07.167 --> 00:37:12.767
with alcohols to chew up the
other alcohols, but not chew 

00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:16.000
up this one. 

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.467
Because that alcohol is now in
the form of OCH3. 

00:37:21.967 --> 00:37:25.633
We'll talk about reactions next
class that involve 

00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:26.700
reactions of alcohols. 

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.800
Oxidation for example. 

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.600
OK. 

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.633
So this is protecting that
particular carbon from being 

00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:37.467
reacted by having a full ketal
there. 

00:37:37.467 --> 00:37:41.167
Now, then you can take it apart
again by treating it 

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:42.533
with acid and water. 

00:37:42.533 --> 00:37:45.500
Get it back and see what
compound you have. Which of 

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.233
the oxygens in that chain got
oxidized and which ones were 

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:50.133
not oxidized. 

00:37:50.133 --> 00:37:53.133
Compare with known compounds and
you know what the size of 

00:37:53.133 --> 00:37:54.367
the ring was. 

00:37:57.067 --> 00:37:58.300
Because notice that this-- 

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:03.400
not only did this group keep...
this OH keep from getting 

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.067
oxidized, this OH, 

00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:12.233
that is this OH, didn't get
oxidized on this side, right? 

00:38:12.233 --> 00:38:16.400
And this OH didn't get oxidized
there. 

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.067
So the protection protects not
only the aldehyde from being 

00:38:20.067 --> 00:38:24.300
oxidized, it also protects the
alcohol. 

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.167
Professor Ziegler, who we've
mentioned, who teaches Chem 

00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:31.333
220 often, is a synthetic
chemist and always, when he 

00:38:31.333 --> 00:38:34.733
teaches a class in synthesis he
always points this out. 

00:38:34.733 --> 00:38:37.233
That people have tunnel vision
often. 

00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:39.133
They think of ketals as
something that 

00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:41.033
protects the carbonyl. 

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.667
But it also protects an alcohol
at the same time 

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:46.700
that's tied up as an ether and
won't do the reactions that 

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.233
the alcohol would do. 

00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:52.667
So you not only protect a
carbonyl, you 

00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:54.767
also protect the ROH. 

00:38:54.767 --> 00:38:59.400
And a particular example of that
is what's called THP 

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.833
protection. 

00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:11.133
So this compound can be reacted
with 

00:39:11.133 --> 00:39:16.367
ROH and acid catalysis. 

00:39:19.533 --> 00:39:21.533
So how's it going to start out?

00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:24.833
Derek, you tell us. 

00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:27.000
Where are you going to protonate
this? 

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.600
STUDENT: The O? 

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.067
PROFESSOR: You could protonate
this O, you could protonate 

00:39:31.067 --> 00:39:32.467
this O, right? 

00:39:35.733 --> 00:39:39.500
Either of them particularly
good? 

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.867
There's actually another place
to protonate that's very good. 

00:39:42.867 --> 00:39:43.600
Can anybody see? 

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.000
Arvind? 

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.367
STUDENT: On the carbon-carbon
double bond? 

00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:48.300
PROFESSOR: Where, top or bottom?

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.567
STUDENT: Umm, bottom. 

00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:53.533
PROFESSOR: Nope. 

00:39:53.533 --> 00:39:55.267
STUDENT: The top. 

00:39:55.267 --> 00:39:56.500
PROFESSOR: Top. 

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:02.567
OK, if we put the H plus here,
why is that good? 

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.267
Got the H here, there are now
two H's there, of course. 

00:40:11.267 --> 00:40:12.533
There was one there already. 

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:18.067
What's good about that cation? 

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:19.000
Matt? 

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.933
STUDENT: Stabilized by the lone
pair on the oxygen. 

00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:21.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.700
You can say-- 

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.433
that's what everybody always
says, that it's stabilized by 

00:40:25.433 --> 00:40:27.600
the lone pair on the oxygen. 

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.967
But actually what it does is
stabilize the lone pair on the 

00:40:30.967 --> 00:40:33.267
oxygen, which makes the molecule
more stable. 

00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:35.500
You're right, that's what
everyone says, that it's 

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.967
stabilized by the lone pair. 

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:40.500
But in truth, it stabilizes the
lone pair. 

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.400
OK, so we got this. 

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.367
Now we got ROH, what's it going
to do? 

00:40:47.467 --> 00:40:49.300
John? 

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.867
What's the ROH going to do now
when you add that cation? 

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:56.333
STUDENT: It'll-- the lone pair
on the oxygen will attack it. 

00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:57.833
PROFESSOR: And then what? 

00:40:57.833 --> 00:41:01.333
STUDENT: And then it'll lose H.

00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:02.233
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:41:02.233 --> 00:41:03.000
Lose proton, right? 

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.900
So we got this. 

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.367
And what functional group is
this that we now have? 

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:12.167
Does anybody recognize this
functional group? 

00:41:16.233 --> 00:41:18.600
It's familiar. 

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.467
Lee? 

00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:23.967
It's a ketal, right? 

00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:27.267
Two ethers on the same carbon. 

00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:33.133
But we didn't make it from a
carbonyl, we made it this way. 

00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:35.900
OK, so now we could do
reactions. 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.633
Suppose this R had something
else coming off that was going 

00:41:39.633 --> 00:41:41.233
to react, maybe a double bond. 

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:43.733
And we wanted to react that, but
we didn't want to react 

00:41:43.733 --> 00:41:45.300
the alcohol. 

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.000
But the ether keeps the alcohol
safe. 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
We do the reaction down here. 

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.100
Now we need to get the alcohol
back again, having done what 

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.567
we wanted to do down here. 

00:41:55.567 --> 00:41:57.533
How are we going to get it back?

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.333
How can we remove this stuff? 

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.867
We can protonate. 

00:42:09.867 --> 00:42:14.500
Protonate the O, lose this,
generate this nice stable 

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.167
cation again, go back. 

00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:17.500
We'd just go back and forth,
right? 

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.033
With water. 

00:42:19.033 --> 00:42:20.567
Go back with water. 

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:21.433
So we can make-- 

00:42:21.433 --> 00:42:23.833
so this is a protecting group
for an alcohol, 

00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:25.100
to keep it from reacting. 

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.533
I'll mention one other
protecting group for alcohols 

00:42:30.533 --> 00:42:34.000
here because they mention it in
the text book that many of 

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.767
you have, which is called TBDMS.
It's 

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.033
t-butyldimethylsilyl. 

00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:48.000
So t-butyl, dimethyl, silyl. 

00:42:51.467 --> 00:42:54.600
And you start with the chloride.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.800
Now the chloride has a bond
strength, this bond, of 

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.333
90 kcal/mole. 

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.833
But you could react it with ROH
and the unshared pair will 

00:43:11.833 --> 00:43:15.433
react to form a bond with
silicon, right? 

00:43:15.433 --> 00:43:19.867
So now the silicon has five
things attached to it. 

00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:22.367
But then the chloride can leave.

00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:24.067
It's not an SN2 reaction. 

00:43:24.067 --> 00:43:27.567
It's an association, followed by
dissociation. 

00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:30.700
Because silicon down in the next
row of the periodic table 

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.467
has vacant orbitals that can
make a bond with that. 

00:43:39.567 --> 00:43:48.667
So now we've got t-butyl, Si,
methyl methyl, O, R. And the 

00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:59.700
strength of the SiO bond is 110
kcal/mole. 

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.733
So this is downhill in energy. 

00:44:02.733 --> 00:44:03.867
OK. 

00:44:03.867 --> 00:44:07.567
Now, so now you can do what you
want to do, other things 

00:44:07.567 --> 00:44:10.100
in the R group, without
touching-- 

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.367
it's not an alcohol anymore. 

00:44:11.367 --> 00:44:13.900
It's a little bit like an ether.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.300
But the neat thing is that
there's a special 

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.700
way to take it apart. 

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.933
You can take it apart by
treating it with 

00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:28.433
tetramethylammonium, methyl, 4N
plus, a salt, 

00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:30.767
but the business end is
fluoride. 

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.633
Because fluoride can attack the
silicon the same way the 

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:38.900
unshared pair on oxygen did
here. 

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.933
And then you can protonate and
lose the OR. 

00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:47.400
So this is the nice thing-- the
product from the silicon 

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.167
is now S-- which you don't
really care about-- 

00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:54.900
is the Si-F, and the Si-F bond
is a fabulous bond. 

00:44:54.900 --> 00:45:06.500
It's 135 kcal/mole. 

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:13.967
Plus now your ROH, once
you've protonated it.

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:17.333
So the nice thing about this is
there's not many things 

00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:19.100
that react with fluoride easily.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.767
It's a terrible nucleophile
generally. 

00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:25.600
So now you have something that's
very selective, that 

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.967
will only do that and take this
protecting group off and 

00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:32.333
not mess up other things that's
in your R group. 

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:36.200
And this was invented in the
1970s by a professor at 

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.800
Harvard who got the Nobel Prize
in Synthetic Chemistry, 

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.033
Professor Corey. 

00:45:44.167 --> 00:45:47.800
So that's those things. 

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.667
And now imines and their
derivatives, and the role of 

00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:55.600
electron pair repulsion and
allylic stabilization. 

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.333
So I'm going to just introduce
this here, and we'll 

00:45:58.333 --> 00:45:59.600
finish it next time. 

00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:09.933
So we have a carbonyl, and we've
been reacting it with 

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.800
alcohols or water. 

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:19.167
But let's consider reacting with
an amine, which actually 

00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:23.333
has certain similarity to water,
of course. 

00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:26.900
It's got the unshared pair, and
protons on the nitrogen 

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.100
the way alcohol has protons on
the oxygen. 

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.400
So this can react, 

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.433
and of course that can lose a
proton here, and it can put a 

00:46:45.433 --> 00:46:47.267
proton on there. 

00:46:47.267 --> 00:46:48.567
It's probably not the same
proton. 

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.733
And this is called a carbinol
amine. 

00:47:02.367 --> 00:47:06.233
What's the analog when you have
an oxygen 

00:47:06.233 --> 00:47:08.500
instead of NH in there? 

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.100
What functional group is it? 

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.767
If this were just an O instead
of an NH, what would you call 

00:47:18.767 --> 00:47:20.033
this functional group? 

00:47:23.233 --> 00:47:25.000
I see you're all bored. 

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.867
It's a hemiketal. 

00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:28.533
That's what we've just been
talking about. 

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:31.967
But the carbinol amine is the
amine analog. 

00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:32.833
Now you can do-- 

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:37.333
because you have this hydrogen
here, you can 

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:40.033
do something special. 

00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:44.133
You can lose this OH, say
protonate and lose it, helped 

00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:45.400
out by this. 

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:51.200
And we get this, 

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.067
and water. 

00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:07.200
Pardon me, it would be
originally NH plus when we use 

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:07.833
the unshared pair, 

00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:10.267
but then we can lose the H plus.

00:48:10.267 --> 00:48:14.633
So now we have this functional
group, 

00:48:14.633 --> 00:48:21.133
which is called an imine, which
is rather like a ketone. 

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.333
So we got rid of the oxygen and
replaced with NR, and the 

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:32.200
oxygen became H2O, by this same
kind of 

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.567
stuff we've been doing. 

00:48:34.567 --> 00:48:40.167
So these imines turn out to be
very important, not only in 

00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:42.833
organic chemistry, but also in
biology. 

00:48:42.833 --> 00:48:44.800
And we'll continue with that
next time. 

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.667
Or actually-- 

00:48:45.667 --> 00:48:48.467
yeah, we'll continue with that,
but there will be no 

00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:52.133
more on the exam on Friday than
what we've done today. 

00:48:52.133 --> 00:48:52.367
OK. 

00:48:52.367 --> 00:48:54.233
STUDENT: Do we need to know
about the amines? 

00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:55.433
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:56.067
STUDENT: We need to know about
the amines? 

00:48:56.067 --> 00:48:58.067
PROFESSOR: Oh, forget the
amines, OK? 

00:48:58.067 --> 00:49:01.300
Just do the ketals and
hemiketals. 

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.600
Imines will be on the final.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.764
All right, so this was the
definition we saw at the end

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:06.915
last time.
I've tried to write it a bit

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.940
larger, it just repeats the
second of those definitions.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.162
This is the definition that
connects the notion of

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:16.450
evolutionary stability,
for now in pure strategies,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.429
with Nash Equilibrium.
Basically it says this,

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.687
to check whether a strategy is
evolutionarily stable in pure

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:24.991
strategies,
first check whether

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.940
(Ŝ,Ŝ) is a symmetric
Nash Equilibrium.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.891
And, if it is,
if it's a strict Nash

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.396
Equilibrium we're done.
And if it's not strict,

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:38.918
that means there's at least
another strategy that would tie

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:42.453
with Ŝ against Ŝ,
then compare how Ŝ

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:46.924
does against this mutation with
how the mutation does against

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:48.475
itself.
And if Ŝ

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:52.129
does better than the mutation
than the mutation does against

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.613
itself then we're okay.
One virtue of this definition

00:00:56.613 --> 00:01:02.261
is it's very easy to check,
so let's try an example to see

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:07.314
that and also to get us back
into gear and reminding

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:11.079
ourselves what we're doing a
bit.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.014
So in this example--sort of
trivial game but still--the game

00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:22.492
looks like this.
And suppose we're asked the

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:27.129
question what is evolutionarily
stable in this game?

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.260
So no prizes for finding the
symmetric Nash Equilibrium in

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.480
this game.
Shout it out.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.640
What's the symmetric Nash
Equilibrium in this game?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.301
(A,A).
So (A,A) is a symmetric Nash

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.940
Equilibrium.
That's easy to check.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.994
So really the only candidate
for an evolutionarily stable

00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:54.561
strategy here is A.
So the second thing you would

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.800
check is: is (A,A) a strict Nash
Equilibrium?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.900
So what does strict Nash
Equilibrium mean?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.610
It means that if you deviate
you do strictly worse.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:18.870
So is (A,A) strict Nash?
Well is it strict Nash or not?

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.757
It's not.
So if you deviate to B,

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:30.860
you notice very quickly that
U(A,A) is equal to U(B,A).

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.048
Is that right?
It's just tie,

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:34.883
both of these get 1.
So it's not a strict Nash

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:38.000
Equilibrium so we have to check
our third rule.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.901
What's our third rule?
So we need to check how does A

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:48.716
do against the possible
deviation which is here--which

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:55.080
is B here, how does that compare
with B against itself?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.595
So U(A,B) the payoff to A
against B is 1 and the payoff to

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:09.319
B against itself is 0:
1 is indeed bigger than 0,

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:18.370
so we're okay and A is in fact
evolutionarily stable.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.074
So: just a very,
very simple example to

00:03:21.074 --> 00:03:24.490
illustrate how quick it is to
check this idea.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.511
I want to spend all of today
going over more interesting

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.971
examples, so having the payoff
of having invested in this last

00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:35.005
time.
To start off with,

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.520
let's get rid of this rather
trivial example.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.780
I want to think about evolution
as it's often applied in the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.324
social sciences.
So one thing you might talk

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:57.128
about in the social sciences is
the evolution of a social

00:03:57.128 --> 00:04:00.726
convention.
Sometimes you'll read a lot in

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:03.145
sociology or political science
about the evolution of

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:05.425
institutions or social
conventions and things like

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:07.752
this--maybe also in
anthropology--and I want to see

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:10.637
a trivial example of this to see
how this might work and to see

00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:15.338
if we can learn anything.
The trivial example I'm going

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:20.930
to think about is driving on the
left or the right;

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.189
on the left or right side of
the road.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.819
So this is a very simple social
convention.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.056
I think we all can agree this
is a social convention and let's

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:32.459
have a look at the payoffs in
this little game.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:37.099
So you could imagine people
drive on the left or drive on

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.987
the right, and if you drive on
the left and the other people

00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:45.914
are driving on the right,
you don't do great and nor do

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:48.109
they;
and if you drive on the right

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:51.348
and they're driving on the left
you don't do great,

00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:55.609
and nor do they.
If you both drive on the right,

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:58.803
you do fine.
But if you both drive on the

00:04:58.803 --> 00:05:02.718
left you do a little better,
because you look a little bit

00:05:02.718 --> 00:05:06.930
more sophisticated.
So this is our little game.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.912
We can see that this,
this could be an evolutionary

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:10.350
game.
So you could imagine this

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.717
emerging--you can imagine a
government coming in and

00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:15.363
imposing a law saying everyone
has to drive on the left or

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:17.220
everyone has to drive on the
right,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.995
but you could also imagine at
the beginning of roads in

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:22.769
different societies in different
parts of the world,

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.417
people just started doing
something and then they settled

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:27.120
down to one convention or
another.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.621
You can see how evolutionary
stability's going to play a role

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.699
here.
Well perhaps we should just

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.050
work it through and see what
happens.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.601
So what are the potential
evolutionarily stable things

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:40.016
here?
What are the potentially

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:43.310
evolutionarily stable things?
Let's get some mikes up.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.125
What's liable to be
evolutionarily stable in this

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:55.009
setting?
Anyone?

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.348
Student: Left,
left and right,

00:05:56.348 --> 00:05:59.260
right are both candidates.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.378
Good, so our obvious candidates
here are left,

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:04.110
left and right,
right.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.964
These are the two candidates.
More formally,

00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:09.900
left is a candidate and right
is a candidate,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.170
but you're right to say that
left, left and right,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.439
right are both Nash Equilibria
in this game.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.311
What's more,
not only are they Nash

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.340
Equilibria but what kind of Nash
Equilibria are they?

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.554
They're strict Nash Equilibria.
The fact they're strict,

00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:29.232
both are strict,
so indeed left is

00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:35.920
evolutionarily stable and right
is evolutionarily stable.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.184
Let's just talk through the
intuition for that and make it

00:06:38.184 --> 00:06:40.980
kind of clear.
So suppose you're in a society

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.302
in which everybody drives on the
left, so this is England and

00:06:45.302 --> 00:06:49.623
suppose a mutation occurs and
the mutation you could think of

00:06:49.623 --> 00:06:53.200
as an American tourist.
An American tourist is dropped

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.593
into English society,
hasn't read the guidebook

00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:58.193
carefully,
starts driving on the right,

00:06:58.193 --> 00:07:00.460
and what happens to the
tourist?

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.302
They die out pretty rapidly.
Conversely, if you drop an

00:07:04.302 --> 00:07:07.959
unobservant Brit into America
and they drive on the right,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.778
they're going to get squashed
pretty quickly,

00:07:10.778 --> 00:07:14.364
so it's kind of clear why
everyone driving on the left or

00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:17.759
why everyone driving on the
right is each of these are

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.730
perfectly good evolutionarily
stable social conventions.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.351
But despite that simplicity,
there's kind of a useful lesson

00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:30.061
here.
So the first lesson here is you

00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:35.160
can have multiple evolutionarily
stable settings,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.578
you could have multiple social
conventions that are

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:39.907
evolutionarily stable.
We shouldn't be surprised

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:42.850
particularly if we think there's
some evolutionary type force,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.744
some sort of random dynamic
going on that's generating

00:07:46.744 --> 00:07:49.610
social conventions other than
stable,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.730
we should not be surprised to
see different social conventions

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.297
in different parts of the world.
In fact we do,

00:07:55.297 --> 00:07:58.313
we do see parts of the world
like England and Japan,

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:01.920
and Australia where they drive
on the left and we see parts of

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.231
the world like France and
America where they drive on the

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:12.622
right,
so we can have multiple

00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:22.699
evolutionarily stable
conventions.

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:26.545
There's another lesson here,
which is you could imagine a

00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:30.459
society settling down to a
social convention down here.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:34.387
You could imagine ending up at
a social convention of right,

00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:36.614
right.
What do we know about the

00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:40.139
social convention of everyone
driving on the right?

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:44.735
We know it's worse than the
social convention of everyone

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:48.509
driving on the left,
at least in my version.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:51.350
So what do we regard,
what can we see here?

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.590
We can see that they're not
necessarily efficient.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:08.164
These need not be equally good.
So it's hard to resist saying

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:12.435
that American society's driving
habits, if we think about the

00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:17.356
alternatives to evolution,
are a good example of

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:22.307
unintelligent design.
So when you're talking about

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:25.732
this in a less formal way,
in your anthropology or

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.658
political science,
or sociology classes you want

00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:31.071
to have in the back of your
mind, what we mean by

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:34.238
evolutionary stability and that
it doesn't necessarily mean that

00:09:34.238 --> 00:09:36.299
we're going to arrive at
efficiency.

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.166
In some sense this is exactly
analogous to what we discussed

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:41.790
when we looked at games like
this with rational players

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.220
playing if you think about
coordination games.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.230
These are essentially
coordination games.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.840
That was a fairly
straightforward example.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.073
To leave it up there let me,
there's another board here

00:09:58.073 --> 00:10:03.498
somewhere, here we go,
let's look at yet another

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:08.000
example, slightly more
interesting.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.780
So today I'm going to spend
most of today just looking at

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:25.042
examples and talking about them.
So here's another example of a

00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:31.840
game we might imagine and once
again it's a two-by-two game,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.306
a nice and simple game,
and here the payoffs are as

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:39.505
follows.
So down the diagonal we have

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:45.889
0,0, 0,0 and off the diagonal we
have 2,1 and 1,2.

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:50.429
So what is this game
essentially?

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:53.837
It's very, very similar to a
game we've seen already in

00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:56.620
class, anybody?
This is essentially Battle of

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.833
the Sexes.
I've taken the Battle of the

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:02.127
Sexes Game, The Dating Game,
I've just twiddled it around to

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:07.319
make it symmetric,
so this is a symmetric version

00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:13.080
of Battle of the Sexes or our
dating game.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.344
You can think of this game also
in the context of driving

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.372
around.
So you could imagine that one

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:24.330
version of this game,
you sometimes hear this game

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.211
referred to as chicken.
What's the game chicken when

00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:30.509
cars are involved?
Anybody?

00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:34.230
What's the game chicken when
cars are involved?

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.880
It's probably a good thing that
people don't know this.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.296
No one knows this?
Okay, all right somebody knows

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:44.470
it.
Can I get the mic way back

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.759
there?
Yeah shout it out.

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:52.230
Right, so you can imagine,
here we are on a road that

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.985
perhaps isn't big enough to have
driving and driving on the

00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:56.975
right.
These two cars face each other,

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:59.664
they drive towards each other,
both of them going in the

00:11:59.664 --> 00:12:03.287
middle of the road,
and the loser is the person who

00:12:03.287 --> 00:12:06.781
swerves first.
If you think of A as being the

00:12:06.781 --> 00:12:11.154
aggressive strategy of not
swerving and B as being the less

00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:13.399
aggressive,
more benevolent strategy,

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.398
if you like,
of swerving--so the best thing

00:12:15.398 --> 00:12:18.016
for you is for you to be
aggressive and the other person

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.679
to swerve,
and then at least they remain

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:22.453
alive.
Conversely, if you're

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:25.928
benevolent and they swerve,
you remain alive but they win

00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:28.606
and unfortunately now,
if you're both aggressive you

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:30.549
get nothing, and the way we've
written this game,

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:32.730
if you're both benevolent you
get nothing.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.629
You can imagine making some
more negatives here.

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:41.735
So this is a game that seems
kind of important in nature,

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:46.059
not just in teenage male
behavior but in animal behavior,

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:54.120
since we're talking about
aggression and non-aggression.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.679
So what's evolutionarily stable
in this game?

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.240
Well remember our starting
point is what?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.580
Our starting point is to look
for symmetric Nash Equilibria.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:12.381
So are there any symmetric Nash
Equilibria in this game and if

00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:15.990
so what are they?
There are some Nash Equilibria

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.425
in pure strategies,
there are some Nash Equilibria

00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:20.224
in this game,
for example,

00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:25.161
(A,B) is a Nash Equilibrium and
(B,A) is a Nash Equilibrium,

00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:28.759
but unfortunately they're not
symmetric,

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.678
and so far we're focusing on
games that are symmetric,

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:34.637
this is random matching.
There's no asymmetry in the

00:13:34.637 --> 00:13:37.466
rows--in the row and column
player, although in the

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:40.495
handout--not the handout,
in the reading packet I made

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:43.385
for you--they do also look at
some asymmetric versions of

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:45.175
games,
but for now we're just looking

00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:48.045
at symmetry.
So neither (A,B) nor (B,A) will

00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:51.823
serve our purpose because
they're not symmetric Nash

00:13:51.823 --> 00:14:02.563
Equilibria.
In fact, there is no symmetric

00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:17.120
pure strategy Nash Equilibrium
in this game.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:23.573
So it can't be that if this was
a species, if this was an animal

00:14:23.573 --> 00:14:26.676
that came in,
that had two possible

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:30.853
strategies, aggression or
passivity, it can't be the case

00:14:30.853 --> 00:14:35.553
in this particular game that you
end up with 100% aggression out

00:14:35.553 --> 00:14:39.954
there--100% aggressive genes out
there--or 100% unaggressive

00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:42.576
genes out there.
In either case,

00:14:42.576 --> 00:14:45.115
if you had 100% aggressive
genes out there,

00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:48.555
then it would be doing very,
very badly and you get an

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:52.436
invasion of passive genes and if
you had 100% passive genes out

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:54.811
there,
you'd get an invasion of

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:59.775
aggressive genes.
You can't have a pure ESS,

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:06.570
a pure evolutionarily stable
gene mix out there.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.351
So what does that suggest?
It suggests we should start

00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:18.149
looking at mixed strategies.
There is a mixed strategy,

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:27.270
there is a symmetric mixed
strategy Nash Equilibrium in the

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:34.820
game and we could go through and
work it out.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.947
We all know now--probably
you've been laboring through the

00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:41.020
homework assignments--so you all
know how to find a mixed

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.379
strategy Nash Equilibrium in
this game,

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:47.610
you have to set the mix to make
the other player indifferent

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.189
between her two strategies.
But this is a game we've seen

00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:53.515
already, it's essentially Battle
of the Sexes,

00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:56.669
so you probably remember from a
week ago what that equilibrium

00:15:56.669 --> 00:15:59.332
mix is.
Can anyone remember what the

00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:02.250
equilibrium mix in Battle of the
Sexes?

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:10.663
Its (2/3,1/3),
turns out that (2/3,1/3) is a

00:16:10.663 --> 00:16:16.964
Nash Equilibrium here.
So if you go back to your notes

00:16:16.964 --> 00:16:20.172
a week ago you'll find something
very much like that was a Nash

00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:23.379
Equilibrium in the original
version of Battle of the Sexes.

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:26.861
A week ago it would have been
(2/3,1/3), (1/3,2/3) because

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.947
things weren't symmetric.
Now I've made things symmetric,

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.710
it's just (2/3,1/3) for both
players.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.700
You can check it out.
So what's this telling us?

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.253
It's telling us that there's at
least an equilibrium in this

00:16:40.253 --> 00:16:44.806
game in which 2/3 of the genes
are aggressive and 1/3 of the

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:48.090
genes are unaggressive.
But does that mean anything?

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.979
What could that mean?
In terms of biology what could

00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:53.182
that mean?
Well, so far,

00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:58.868
we've been looking at
evolutionarily stable pure

00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:04.191
strategies and the
evolutionarily stable pure

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:10.966
strategies correspond to
evolutionarily stable situations

00:17:10.966 --> 00:17:17.619
in nature which are what are
called monomorphic.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:23.758
Monomorphic means one shape or
one type out there,

00:17:23.758 --> 00:17:30.397
but you can also have
situations in nature where there

00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:38.789
are actually stable mixed types
and they're called polymorphic.

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:41.119
It's probably not hyphenated,
it's probably just one word.

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:48.222
So you can have a monomorphic
population, that's what we've

00:17:48.222 --> 00:17:54.223
focused on so far,
but you could also have a mixed

00:17:54.223 --> 00:17:57.515
population.
Now for this to be a mixed

00:17:57.515 --> 00:18:00.650
population we better change the
definition accordingly.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.406
We'll come back and talk about
what it means in a second a bit

00:18:03.406 --> 00:18:06.162
more, but first we better make
sure we have an okay definition

00:18:06.162 --> 00:18:08.107
for it.
So what I'm going to do is I'm

00:18:08.107 --> 00:18:11.051
going to drag this definition
down and do something you're not

00:18:11.051 --> 00:18:15.111
meant to do usually in teaching,
I'm going to use the eraser to

00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:18.842
correct my definition.
So here I have my pure strategy

00:18:18.842 --> 00:18:22.419
definition and let me just
change it into a definition that

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:25.380
will allow for these polymorphic
populations.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:31.582
So I'm going to change this
into a P, I'm going to change

00:18:31.582 --> 00:18:38.120
this pure into mixed,
and everywhere you see an

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:46.100
Ŝ I'm going to put a P,,
and over here too and

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:54.240
everywhere you see an S' I'm
going to put a P.''

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.484
The reason I'm doing this this
way is I want to emphasize that

00:18:57.484 --> 00:19:01.671
there's nothing new here,
I'm just writing down the same

00:19:01.671 --> 00:19:06.899
definitions we had before,
except I'm now allowing for the

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:11.249
idea of populations being mixed,
and I'm also,

00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:15.546
just to note in passing,
I'm also allowing for the

00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:19.580
possibility that a mutation
might be mixed.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.775
Did I catch them all?
So I've just gone through the

00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:25.953
definition you have and I've
switched everything from pure to

00:19:25.953 --> 00:19:26.430
mixed.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:45.619
So in our example does the mix
2/3,1/3 satisfy the definition

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:49.730
above?
Let's go through carefully.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.201
So (2/3,1/3) is a Nash
Equilibrium so we've satisfied

00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:56.872
part A, it's a symmetric Nash
Equilibrium, so we're okay

00:19:56.872 --> 00:20:00.613
there.
Is this equilibrium a strict

00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:04.859
equilibrium?
Is this mixed population 2/3

00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:10.398
aggressive and 1/3 unaggressive,
or this mixed strategy,

00:20:10.398 --> 00:20:18.210
is it a strict equilibrium?
How do deviations do against it?

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.260
Anybody?
Go ahead.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.948
Student: Equally well.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:20:23.948 --> 00:20:24.789
Equally well,
thank you.

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:29.621
So it can't be a strict Nash
Equilibrium, because if we

00:20:29.621 --> 00:20:34.990
deviated to A we'd do as well as
we were doing in the mix,

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.615
or if we deviated to B,
we'd do as well as we're doing

00:20:37.615 --> 00:20:39.877
in the mix.
Another way of saying it is,

00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:43.401
an A mutation does exactly as
well against this mix as the mix

00:20:43.401 --> 00:20:45.729
does against itself,
and a B mutation does exactly

00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:47.055
as well.
In fact, that's how we

00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:49.269
constructed the equilibrium in
the first place.

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:58.132
We chose a P that made you
indifferent between A and B,

00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:07.978
so in a mixed Nash Equilibrium
it can't be strict since it is

00:21:07.978 --> 00:21:11.599
mixed.
In a mixed Nash Equilibrium,

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:14.991
a genuinely mixed Nash
Equilibrium by definition,

00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:18.950
you're indifferent between the
strategies in the mix.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:24.004
So to show that this is in fact
evolutionarily stable we'd have

00:21:24.004 --> 00:21:28.498
to show rule B,
so we need to show--we need to

00:21:28.498 --> 00:21:35.027
check--let's give ourselves some
room here--we need to check how

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:40.116
the payoff of this strategy,
let's call it P,

00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:47.505
how P does against all possible
deviations and compare that with

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:52.900
how those deviations do against
themselves.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.101
We have to make this comparison
- how does this mix do against

00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:01.026
all other possible mixes versus
how those mixes do against

00:22:01.026 --> 00:22:04.779
themselves?
We'd have to do this,

00:22:04.779 --> 00:22:10.607
unfortunately,
we'd have to check this for all

00:22:10.607 --> 00:22:18.119
possible--and now we have to be
careful--all possible mixed

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:22.569
mutations P''.
So that would take us a while,

00:22:22.569 --> 00:22:26.315
it's actually possible to do.
If you do enough math,

00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:30.016
it isn't so hard to do.
So rather than prove that to

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:34.099
you, let me give you a heuristic
argument why this is the case.

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:37.218
I'm going to try and convince
you without actually proving it

00:22:37.218 --> 00:22:41.059
that this is indeed the case.
So here we are with this

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:46.817
population, exactly 2/3 of the
population is aggressive and 1/3

00:22:46.817 --> 00:22:52.339
of the population is passive.
Suppose there is a mutation,

00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:57.164
P'', that is more aggressive
than P, it's a relatively

00:22:57.164 --> 00:23:00.193
aggressively mutation.
For example,

00:23:00.193 --> 00:23:03.648
this mutation may be 100%
aggressive, or at least it may

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.721
be very, very highly
aggressively,

00:23:05.721 --> 00:23:08.799
maybe 90% aggressive or
something like that.

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:12.608
Now I want to argue that that
aggressive mutation is going to

00:23:12.608 --> 00:23:16.670
die out and I'm going to argue
it by thinking about this rule.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.457
So I want to argue that the
reason this very aggressive

00:23:20.457 --> 00:23:24.736
mutation dies out is because the
aggressive mutation does very

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.220
badly against itself.
Is that right?

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.489
If you have a very aggressive
mutant, the very aggressive

00:23:31.489 --> 00:23:34.996
mutants do very,
very badly against themselves,

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:39.240
they get 0.
And that's going to cause them

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.940
to die out.
What about the other extreme?

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.250
What about a deviation that's
very passive?

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.932
So a very nice mutation,
a very passive type,

00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:52.363
for example,
it could a 100% B or you know

00:23:52.363 --> 00:23:55.460
99% B or 98% B,
how will that do?

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.124
Well it turns out,
in this game again,

00:23:58.124 --> 00:24:02.230
it doesn't do very well against
itself and in addition,

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.644
the original mix,
the mixed P that is more

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:10.308
aggressive than this very
passive mutation does very well

00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:13.780
against the mutation.
So the mix that's in there,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.509
the mix that's in the
population already is relatively

00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:19.547
aggressive compared to this very
passive mutation and so the

00:24:19.547 --> 00:24:21.712
incumbent,
the relatively aggressive

00:24:21.712 --> 00:24:24.719
incumbents are doing very,
very well on average against

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:27.670
the mutation,
and hence once again,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.843
this equality holds.
So just heuristically,

00:24:30.843 --> 00:24:33.274
without proving it,
more aggressive mutations are

00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:36.109
going to lose out here because
they do very badly against

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:39.170
themselves,
and more passive mutations are

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.595
going to do badly because they
make life easy for P which is

00:24:43.595 --> 00:24:46.836
more aggressive.
So it wasn't a proof but it was

00:24:46.836 --> 00:24:50.410
a heuristic argument and it
turns out indeed to be the case.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.027
So in this particular game,
a game you could imagine in

00:24:54.027 --> 00:24:57.711
nature, a game involving
aggression and passivity within

00:24:57.711 --> 00:25:01.213
this species,
it turns out that in this

00:25:01.213 --> 00:25:06.791
example the only equilibrium is
a mixed equilibrium with 2/3

00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:11.924
aggressive and 1/3 unaggressive.
And this raises the question:

00:25:11.924 --> 00:25:16.013
what does it mean?
What does it mean to have a mix

00:25:16.013 --> 00:25:19.503
in nature?
So it could mean two different

00:25:19.503 --> 00:25:22.665
things.
It could mean that the gene

00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:27.160
itself is randomizing.
It could mean that the strategy

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.509
played by the particular ant,
squirrel, lion,

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:33.631
or spider is actually to
randomize, right,

00:25:33.631 --> 00:25:36.046
that's possible.
But there's another thing it

00:25:36.046 --> 00:25:37.680
could mean that's probably a
little bit more important.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.430
What's the other thing it could
mean?

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.511
It could mean that in the
stable mix, the evolutionarily

00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:48.369
stable population,
for this particular spider say,

00:25:48.369 --> 00:25:53.403
it could be that there are
actually two types surviving

00:25:53.403 --> 00:25:57.586
stably in these proportions.
If you go back to what we said

00:25:57.586 --> 00:26:00.405
about mixed strategies a week
ago, we said one of the possible

00:26:00.405 --> 00:26:02.854
interpretations of mixed
strategies is not that people

00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:06.276
are necessarily randomizing,
but that you see a mix of

00:26:06.276 --> 00:26:09.772
different strategies in society.
Again in nature,

00:26:09.772 --> 00:26:12.378
one of the impossible
interpretations here,

00:26:12.378 --> 00:26:15.170
the polymorphic population
interpretation,

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.728
is that, rather than just have
all of the species look and act

00:26:20.728 --> 00:26:26.013
alike, it could be there's a
stable mix of behaviors and/or

00:26:26.013 --> 00:26:31.734
appearances in this species.
So let me try and convince you

00:26:31.734 --> 00:26:35.380
that that's not an uninteresting
idea.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.444
So again, with apologies I'm
not a biologist,

00:26:37.444 --> 00:26:40.352
I've spent a bit of time on the
web this weekend trying to come

00:26:40.352 --> 00:26:43.167
up with good examples for you
and the example I really wanted

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:45.544
to come up with,
I couldn't find on the web,

00:26:45.544 --> 00:26:48.533
which makes me think maybe it's
apocryphal, but I'll tell you

00:26:48.533 --> 00:26:50.990
the story anyway.
It's not entirely apocryphal,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.559
it may just be that my version
of it's apocryphal.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:55.905
So this particular example I
have in mind,

00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:59.165
is to do with elephant seals,
and I think even if it isn't

00:26:59.165 --> 00:27:02.375
true of elephant seals,
it's definitely true of certain

00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:04.792
types of fish,
except that elephant seals make

00:27:04.792 --> 00:27:08.301
a better story.
So imagine that these elephant

00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:12.790
seals--it turns out that there
are two possible mating

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.009
strategies for male elephant
seals.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:19.119
By the way, do you all know
what elephant seals are?

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.650
They're these big--people are
looking blankly at me.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.703
You all have some rough image
in your mind of an elephant

00:27:23.703 --> 00:27:25.003
seal?
You've all seen enough nature

00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:28.109
shows at night?
Yes, no, yes?

00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:32.826
Okay, so there are two male
mating strategies for the male

00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:36.624
elephant seal.
One successful male mating

00:27:36.624 --> 00:27:40.430
strategy is to be the head,
the dominant,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.233
or a dominant elephant male,
male elephant seal,

00:27:45.233 --> 00:27:50.208
and have as it were,
a harem of many female elephant

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:54.109
seals with which the male mates
with.

00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:56.417
For the males in the room don't
get too happy,

00:27:56.417 --> 00:27:58.930
these are elephant seals,
they're not you guys.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.643
So one possible successful
strategy is to be a successful

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:08.272
bull elephant seal and have
many, many, many potentially

00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:13.066
wives, so to be a polygamist.
Presumably to do that well a

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:17.673
good idea, a thing that would go
well with that strategy is to be

00:28:17.673 --> 00:28:20.127
huge.
So you could imagine the

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:24.509
successful male elephant seal
being an enormous animal.

00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:28.471
It looks like a sort of a
linebacker in football and

00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:33.519
basically fights off all other
big elephant seals that show up.

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:35.931
But it turns out,
I think I'm right in saying if

00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:39.058
I did my research correctly,
this is true among northern

00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:42.529
elephant seals but not true
among southern elephant seals,

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:44.775
so the Arctic not the
Antarctic, but someone's going

00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:46.355
to correct me.
Once it's on the web I'm going

00:28:46.355 --> 00:28:48.020
to get floods of emails saying
that I've got this wrong.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.054
But never mind.
So it turns out that this is

00:28:51.054 --> 00:28:55.280
not quite evolutionarily stable.
Why is this not evolutionarily

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.737
stable?
What's the alternative male

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:05.297
strategy that can successfully
invade the large bull harem

00:29:05.297 --> 00:29:10.710
keeper elephant seal?
Any guesses?

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:16.054
Anyone looking for a successful
career as an elephant seal,

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:19.230
as a male elephant seal?
Say that again?

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.848
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak:

00:29:21.848 --> 00:29:24.049
Good, so good thank you.
Did people catch that?

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:29.083
Good, an alternative strategy
is to be a male elephant seal

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:33.509
who looks remarkably like a
female elephant seal.

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:38.418
Instead of looking like a
linebacker, they look like a

00:29:38.418 --> 00:29:41.106
wide receiver.
I'm offending somebody in the

00:29:41.106 --> 00:29:43.350
football team.
You get the idea, right?

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.146
What do they do?
They sneak in among these large

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:52.499
numbers of male elephant seals
and they just mate with a few of

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:54.533
them.
So they look like a female

00:29:54.533 --> 00:29:57.684
seal, and they can hide among
the female elephant seals in the

00:29:57.684 --> 00:29:59.636
harem,
and they mate with a few of

00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:02.444
them and provided this is
successful enough it'll be

00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:05.748
evolutionarily stable for the
female elephant seal to want to

00:30:05.748 --> 00:30:08.452
mate with that too.
Now I forget if actually this

00:30:08.452 --> 00:30:10.455
is exactly right,
but it's certainly--I did

00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:13.411
enough research over the weekend
to know it's right at least in

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:15.849
some species,
and the nicest part of this

00:30:15.849 --> 00:30:19.302
story is that at least some
biologists have a nice technical

00:30:19.302 --> 00:30:22.930
name for this strategy that was
well described by our friend at

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.469
the back,
and the name for this strategy

00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:32.179
is SLF, and since we're on film
I'm going to tell you what the S

00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:35.111
and the L are,
but you'll have to guess the

00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:39.585
rest.
So this is sneaky,

00:30:39.585 --> 00:30:50.720
this is little,
and you can guess what that is.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.370
So this turns out to be
actually quite a common

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.440
occurrence.
It's been observed in a number

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.461
of different species,
perhaps not with the full added

00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:04.478
color I just gave to it.
So having convinced you that

00:31:04.478 --> 00:31:08.679
polymorphic populations can be
interesting, let's go back to a

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:10.466
case,
a more subtle case,

00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:12.550
of aggression and
non-aggression,

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.651
because that seems to be one of
the most important things we can

00:31:16.651 --> 00:31:23.541
think of in animal behavior.
So let's go back and look at a

00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:30.180
harder example of this,
where we started.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.890
So as these examples get
harder, they also get more

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.139
interesting.
So that's why I want to get a

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:34.460
little bit harder.

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:45.008
So the chicken game,
the Battle of the Sexes game,

00:31:45.008 --> 00:31:47.377
is not a particularly
interesting version of

00:31:47.377 --> 00:31:51.063
aggression and non-aggression.
Let's look at a more general

00:31:51.063 --> 00:31:53.847
version of aggression versus
non-aggression,

00:31:53.847 --> 00:31:57.927
and let's look at a game that's
been studied a lot by biologists

00:31:57.927 --> 00:32:01.359
and a little bit by economists
called hawk-dove.

00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:05.673
And again, just to stress,
we're talking about within

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:10.070
species competition here,
so I don't mean hawks versus

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.083
doves.
I mean thinking of hawk as

00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:17.702
being an aggressive strategy and
dove as being a dovish,

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:21.624
a passive strategy.
So here's the game and now

00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:25.932
we're going to look at more
general payoffs than we did

00:32:25.932 --> 00:32:28.785
before.
So this is the hawk strategy,

00:32:28.785 --> 00:32:33.250
this is the dove strategy--hawk
and dove--and the payoffs are as

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:38.220
follows.
V + C--sorry, start again.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:45.182
(V-C)/2 and (V-C)/2 and here we
get V/2 and V/2,

00:32:45.182 --> 00:32:52.589
and here we get V and 0 and
here we get 0 and V.

00:32:52.589 --> 00:32:55.488
So this is a generalization,
a more interesting version of

00:32:55.488 --> 00:32:57.761
the game we saw already.
Let's just talk about it a

00:32:57.761 --> 00:33:01.181
little bit.
So the idea here is there's

00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:07.695
some potential battle that can
occur among these two animals

00:33:07.695 --> 00:33:11.670
and the prize in the battle is
V.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:17.250
So V is the victor's spoils and
we're going to assume that V is

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.804
positive.
And unfortunately,

00:33:19.804 --> 00:33:25.279
if the animals fight--so if the
hawk meets another hawk and they

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:30.059
fight one another--then there
are costs of fighting.

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:35.475
So the costs of fighting are C,
and again, we'll assume that

00:33:35.475 --> 00:33:42.769
they're positive.
So this is the cost of fighting.

00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:45.769
This more general format is
going to allow us to do two

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:48.131
things.
We're going to look and ask

00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:50.957
what is going to be
evolutionarily stable,

00:33:50.957 --> 00:33:54.588
including mixtures now.
And we're also going to be

00:33:54.588 --> 00:33:56.498
allowed to ask,
able to ask,

00:33:56.498 --> 00:33:59.044
what happens,
what will happen to the

00:33:59.044 --> 00:34:03.499
evolutionarily stable mix as we
change the prize or as we change

00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:08.161
the cost of fighting?
Seems a more interesting,

00:34:08.161 --> 00:34:12.375
a richer game.
Okay, so let's start off by

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:17.682
asking could we have an
evolutionarily stable population

00:34:17.682 --> 00:34:22.828
of doves?
So is D an evolutionarily

00:34:22.828 --> 00:34:27.587
stable strategy?
I'll start using the term ESS

00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:30.620
now.
So ESS means the evolutionarily

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:37.719
stable strategy.
Is D in an ESS.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:41.223
So in this game,
could it be the case that we

00:34:41.223 --> 00:34:44.090
end up with a population of
doves?

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.823
Seems a nice thing to imagine,
but is it going to occur in

00:34:48.823 --> 00:34:51.429
this game in nature?
What do people think?

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.330
How do we go about checking
that?

00:34:54.330 --> 00:35:00.646
What's the first step?
First step is to ask,

00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:07.405
is (D, D) a Nash Equilibrium?
If it's evolutionarily stable,

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.892
in particular,
(D,D) would have to be a Nash

00:35:09.892 --> 00:35:12.421
Equilibrium.
That's going to make it pretty

00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:14.913
easy to check,
so is (D, D) a Nash Equilibrium

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:17.409
in this game?
It's not, but why not?

00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:19.940
Because if you had a mutation,
keep on tempted to say

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.519
deviation, but you want to think
of it as mutation.

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:27.976
If I had a mutation of hawks,
the hawk mutation against the

00:35:27.976 --> 00:35:32.491
doves is getting V,
whereas, dove against dove is

00:35:32.491 --> 00:35:36.160
only getting V/2,
so it's not Nash.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.757
So we can't have a
evolutionarily stable population

00:35:44.757 --> 00:35:48.510
of doves, and the reason is
there will be a hawk mutation,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.659
an aggressive type will get in
there and grow,

00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:55.579
much like we had last week when
we dropped Rahul into the

00:35:55.579 --> 00:35:58.940
classroom in Prisoner's Dilemma
and he grew,

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:05.393
or his type grew.
So second question:

00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:14.250
is hawk an evolutionarily
stable strategy?

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.052
So how do we check this?
What we have to look at once

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:24.184
again--and ask the
question--this is the first

00:36:24.184 --> 00:36:30.000
question to ask is:
is (H,H) a Nash Equilibrium?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.949
So is it a Nash Equilibrium?
Well I claim it depends.

00:36:33.949 --> 00:36:42.406
I claim it's a Nash Equilibrium
provided (V-C)/2 is at least as

00:36:42.406 --> 00:36:46.730
large as 0.
Is that right?

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.934
It's a Nash Equilibrium--it's a
symmetric Nash Equilibrium

00:36:49.934 --> 00:36:53.307
--provided hawk against hawk
does better, or does at least as

00:36:53.307 --> 00:36:59.795
well as, dove against hawk.
So the answer is yes,

00:36:59.795 --> 00:37:07.929
if (V-C)/2 is at least as big
as 0.

00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:13.665
So now we have to think fairly
carefully, because there's two

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:18.042
cases.
So case one is the easy case

00:37:18.042 --> 00:37:23.590
which is when V is strictly
bigger than C.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:28.872
If V is strictly bigger than C,
then (V-C)/2 is strictly

00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:32.304
positive, is that right?
In which case,

00:37:32.304 --> 00:37:35.040
what kind of a Nash Equilibrium
is this?

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:42.554
It's strict right?
So if V is bigger than C then

00:37:42.554 --> 00:37:50.699
(H, H) is a strict Nash
Equilibrium.

00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:59.567
The second case is if V is
equal to C, then (V-C)/2 is

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:07.431
actually equal to 0,
which is the same as saying

00:38:07.431 --> 00:38:17.470
that the payoff of H against H
is equal to the payoff of dove

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:24.690
against hawk.
That correct?

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.699
So in that case what do we have
to check?

00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:28.403
Well I've deleted it now,
it'll have to come from your

00:38:28.403 --> 00:38:30.331
notes, what do I have to check
in the case in which there's a

00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:30.910
tie like that?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.460
What do I have to check?
I have to check--in this case I

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.938
need to check how hawk does
against dove,

00:38:43.938 --> 00:38:48.079
because dove will be the
mutation.

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:59.570
I need to compare that with the
payoff of dove against dove.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.269
So how does hawk do against
dove?

00:39:01.269 --> 00:39:06.630
What's the payoff of hawk
against dove?

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.680
Anybody?
Payoff of hawk against dove.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.808
It shouldn't be that hard.
It's on the board:

00:39:10.808 --> 00:39:13.340
hawk against dove.
Shout it out.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.881
V, thank you.
So this is V and how about the

00:39:17.881 --> 00:39:25.545
payoff of dove against dove?
V/2, so which is bigger V or

00:39:25.545 --> 00:39:28.027
V/2?
V is bigger because it's

00:39:28.027 --> 00:39:30.890
positive, so this is bigger so
we're okay.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.366
So what have we shown?
We've shown,

00:39:34.366 --> 00:39:41.804
let's just draw it over here,
we've shown,

00:39:41.804 --> 00:39:52.870
that if V is at least as big as
C, then H is an evolutionarily

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:58.034
stable strategy.
So in this game,

00:39:58.034 --> 00:40:02.519
in this setting in nature,
if the size of the prize to

00:40:02.519 --> 00:40:07.598
winning the fight is bigger than
the cost that would occur if

00:40:07.598 --> 00:40:11.963
there is a fight,
then it can occur that all the

00:40:11.963 --> 00:40:15.885
animals in this species are
going to fight in an

00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:20.117
evolutionarily stable setting.
Let me say it again,

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:24.400
if it turns out in this setting
in nature that the prize to

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.448
winning the fight is bigger,
or at least as big as,

00:40:28.448 --> 00:40:32.444
the cost of fighting,
then it will turn out that it

00:40:32.444 --> 00:40:37.000
be evolutionarily stable for all
the animals to fight.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.690
The only surviving genes will
be the aggressive genes.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.002
What does that mean?
So what typically do we think

00:40:44.002 --> 00:40:46.670
of as the payoffs to fight and
the costs of fighting?

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.800
Just to put this in a
biological context.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.166
The fight could be about what?
It could be--let's go back to

00:40:53.166 --> 00:40:57.155
where we started from--it could
be males fighting for the right

00:40:57.155 --> 00:40:59.811
to mate with females.
This could be pretty important

00:40:59.811 --> 00:41:02.114
for genetic fitness.
It could be females fighting

00:41:02.114 --> 00:41:04.019
over the right to mate with
males.

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:08.186
It could also be fighting over,
for example,

00:41:08.186 --> 00:41:12.484
food or shelter.
So if the prize is large and

00:41:12.484 --> 00:41:17.867
the cost of fighting is small,
you're going to see fights in

00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:22.460
nature.
But we're not done yet,

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.960
why are we not done?
Because we've only considered

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.469
the case when V is bigger than
C.

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:35.579
So we also need to consider the
case when C is bigger than V.

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:39.648
This is the case where the cost
of fighting are high relative to

00:41:39.648 --> 00:41:43.199
the prize in the particular
setting we're looking at.

00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:46.202
So again let's go back to the
example, suppose the cost of

00:41:46.202 --> 00:41:49.205
fighting could be that the
animal could lose a leg or even

00:41:49.205 --> 00:41:51.796
its life,
and the prize is just today's

00:41:51.796 --> 00:41:55.150
meal, and perhaps there are
other meals out there.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.250
Then we expect something
different to occur.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.626
However, we've already
concluded that even in this

00:42:00.626 --> 00:42:04.346
setting it cannot be the case
only to have doves in the

00:42:04.346 --> 00:42:06.782
population.
We've shown that even in the

00:42:06.782 --> 00:42:10.090
case where the costs of fighting
are high relative to the prizes,

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.883
it cannot be evolutionarily
stable only to have dove genes

00:42:14.883 --> 00:42:17.340
around;
passive genes around.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.383
So in this case,
it must be the case that if

00:42:19.383 --> 00:42:22.140
anything is evolutionarily
stable it's going to be what?

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:28.301
It's going to be a mix.
So in this case,

00:42:28.301 --> 00:42:40.100
we know that H is not ESS and
we know that D is not ESS.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.140
So what about a mix?

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.798
What about some mix P?
We could actually put P the in

00:42:52.798 --> 00:42:59.996
here.
We can imagine looking for a

00:42:59.996 --> 00:43:09.981
mix P, 1- P that will be stable.
Now how we do go about finding

00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:14.772
a possible mixed population that
has some chance or some hope of

00:43:14.772 --> 00:43:18.050
being evolutionarily stable?
So here we are we're biologists.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.019
We're about to set up an
experiment.

00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:22.056
We're about to either
experiment, or about to go out

00:43:22.056 --> 00:43:24.140
and do some field work out
there.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.992
And you want to set things up.
And we're asking the question:

00:43:27.992 --> 00:43:30.800
what's the mix we expect to
see?

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.070
What's the first exercise we
should do here?

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.911
Well if it has any hope to be
evolutionarily stable,

00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:40.768
what does it have to be?
It has to be a symmetric Nash

00:43:40.768 --> 00:43:45.442
Equilibrium.
So the first step is,

00:43:45.442 --> 00:43:57.568
step one find a symmetric mixed
Nash Equilibrium in which people

00:43:57.568 --> 00:44:04.505
will be playing P (,1- P).
It's symmetric,

00:44:04.505 --> 00:44:07.760
so both sides will be playing
this.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.110
So this is good review for the
exam on Wednesday.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:17.570
How do I go about finding a
mixed equilibrium here?

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.550
Shouldn't be too many blank
faces.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.099
This is likely to come up on
the exam on Wednesday.

00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:24.150
Let's get some cold calling
going on here.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.030
How do I find the mix strategy?
Just find anybody.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.400
How do we find--how do I find a
mixed strategy equilibrium?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.070
Student: Just use the
other player's payoff.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:33.537
Professor Ben Polak: I
use the other player's payoffs

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:35.670
and what do I do with the other
person's payoffs?

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.449
Student: You set them
equal.

00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:37.580
Professor Ben Polak: Set
them equal, okay.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.053
So here it's a symmetric game.
It's really there's only one

00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:43.993
population out there.
So all I need,

00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:49.100
I need the payoff of hawk
against P or (P,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:56.325
1-P), I need this to be equal
to the payoff of dove against

00:44:56.325 --> 00:44:59.662
this P.
So the payoff of hawk is going

00:44:59.662 --> 00:45:02.665
to be what?
Just reading up from up

00:45:02.665 --> 00:45:08.574
there--let's use our pointer--so
hawk P of the time will meet

00:45:08.574 --> 00:45:12.119
another hawk and get this
payoff.

00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:23.794
So they'll get--so P of the
time they'll get a payoff of

00:45:23.794 --> 00:45:35.893
(V-C)/2 and 1- P of the time
they'll meet a dove and get a

00:45:35.893 --> 00:45:44.572
payoff of V.
And dove against this same mix

00:45:44.572 --> 00:45:55.664
(P, 1- P): P of the time they'll
meet a hawk and get nothing and

00:45:55.664 --> 00:46:05.699
1-P of the time they'll meet
another dove and get V/2.

00:46:05.699 --> 00:46:06.829
Everyone happy with the way I
did that?

00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:10.990
That should be pretty familiar
territory to everybody by now,

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.786
is that right?
So I'm going to set these two

00:46:13.786 --> 00:46:16.753
things equal to each other since
they must be equal,

00:46:16.753 --> 00:46:19.719
if this is in fact a mixed
strategy equilibrium.

00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:22.230
And then I'm going to play
around with the algebra.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:27.174
So as to save time I did it at
home, so trust me on this--this

00:46:27.174 --> 00:46:31.713
is implication with the word
trust on top of it--trust me

00:46:31.713 --> 00:46:36.010
that I got the algebra right or
check me at home.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:53.309
This is going to turn out to
imply that P equals V/C.

00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:57.315
So it turns out that there is
in fact a mixed Nash

00:46:57.315 --> 00:47:02.120
Equilibirum.
There's a mixed Nash

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:09.808
Equilibrium which is of the
following form,

00:47:09.808 --> 00:47:17.130
V/C and 1-V/C played by both
players.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.820
Is this a strict Nash
Equilibrium?

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.539
I've found the Nash
Equilibrium, is it strict?

00:47:23.539 --> 00:47:24.390
Everyone should be shouting it
out.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.307
Is it strict?
It can't be strict because it's

00:47:27.307 --> 00:47:29.119
mixed right?
By definition it's not.

00:47:29.119 --> 00:47:31.688
It can't be strict because we
know that deviating to H,

00:47:31.688 --> 00:47:34.066
or, for that matter,
deviating to D yields the same

00:47:34.066 --> 00:47:36.119
payoff.
So it can't be a strict Nash

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:39.240
Equilibrium.
So we need to check something.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:50.846
So we need to check not strict;
so we need to check whether U

00:47:50.846 --> 00:48:00.322
of P against P'' is bigger than
U of P'' against itself,

00:48:00.322 --> 00:48:10.659
and we need to check this for
all possible mutations P''.

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:13.459
Again, that would take a little
bit of time to do in class,

00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:15.389
so just trust me on it and once
again,

00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:17.940
let me give you the heuristic
argument I gave to you before.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.050
It's essentially the same
argument.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.862
So the heuristic argument I
gave to you before was:

00:48:23.862 --> 00:48:26.682
imagine a P',
a mutation, that is more

00:48:26.682 --> 00:48:30.190
aggressive than our candidate
equilibrium.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.418
If it's more aggressive then
it's going to do very,

00:48:33.418 --> 00:48:36.905
very badly against itself
because C is bigger than V in

00:48:36.905 --> 00:48:39.596
this case.
So it's actually going to get

00:48:39.596 --> 00:48:43.090
negative payoffs against itself.
Since it gets negative payoffs

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.328
against itself,
it turns out that will cause it

00:48:45.328 --> 00:48:48.413
to die out.
Conversely, imagine a mutation

00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:52.420
that's relatively soft,
that's relatively dovish,

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:56.349
this mutation is very good for
the incumbents because the

00:48:56.349 --> 00:49:00.488
incumbents essentially beat up
on it or score very highly on

00:49:00.488 --> 00:49:02.173
it.
So once again,

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.500
the more dovish mutation will
die out.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.989
So again, that isn't a proof
but trust the argument.

00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:15.833
We need to show this but it
does in fact turn out to be the

00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:18.769
case.
So what have we shown here?

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:22.291
It didn't prove the last bit,
but what we've argued is that,

00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:25.932
in the case in which the cost
of fighting in nature are bigger

00:49:25.932 --> 00:49:28.380
than the prizes of winning the
fight,

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:34.230
it is not the case that we end
up with a 100% doves.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.689
So we don't end up with no
fights, for example:

00:49:36.689 --> 00:49:39.949
no fights is not what we would
expect to observe in nature.

00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:43.265
And we don't end up with a 100%
fights: 100% fights is not what

00:49:43.265 --> 00:49:47.267
you expect to see in nature.
What we end up with is a

00:49:47.267 --> 00:49:53.061
mixture of hawks and doves,
such that V/C is the proportion

00:49:53.061 --> 00:49:57.936
of hawks.
So the fights that occur are

00:49:57.936 --> 00:50:03.712
essentially V/C squared.
We can actually observe those

00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:06.602
fights in nature.
What lessons can we draw from

00:50:06.602 --> 00:50:07.390
this?
So biology lessons.

00:50:20.909 --> 00:50:24.648
So we used a lot of what we've
learned in the last day or so to

00:50:24.648 --> 00:50:26.820
figure out what the ESS was
there.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.862
We kind of did the nerdy part.
Now let's try and draw some

00:50:29.862 --> 00:50:30.550
lessons from it.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:51.927
So the first thing we know
is--I've hidden what we care

00:50:51.927 --> 00:50:59.050
about here--so we know that if V
is smaller than C,

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:11.780
then the evolutionarily stable
mixed population has V/C hawks.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.860
So let's just see how much of
this makes sense.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:19.472
So as V goes up,
as the prizes go up--if you

00:51:19.472 --> 00:51:26.014
took the same species and put
them into a setting in which the

00:51:26.014 --> 00:51:32.449
prizes tended to be larger--what
would we expect to see?

00:51:32.449 --> 00:51:35.519
Would we expect to see the
proportion of hawks up or down?

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:45.760
Up right: as V goes up,
we see more hawks.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:52.201
What else do we see?
Not so surprisingly as C goes

00:51:52.201 --> 00:52:00.579
up--we look at settings where
the cost of fighting is

00:52:00.579 --> 00:52:06.539
higher--we tend to see more
doves.

00:52:06.539 --> 00:52:09.677
Now this is in ESS,
so more hawks in the

00:52:09.677 --> 00:52:13.334
evolutionarily stable mix.
And more doves in the

00:52:13.334 --> 00:52:15.766
evolutionarily stable mix.
It's possible,

00:52:15.766 --> 00:52:18.496
of course that the species in
question can recognize these two

00:52:18.496 --> 00:52:20.690
different situations and be
coded differently,

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:24.434
to behave differently in these
two different situations but

00:52:24.434 --> 00:52:29.268
that's beyond the class for now.
Perhaps a more interesting

00:52:29.268 --> 00:52:32.719
observation is about the
payoffs.

00:52:32.719 --> 00:52:37.250
Let's look at the actual
genetic fitness of the species

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.697
overall.
So in this mix what is the

00:52:40.697 --> 00:52:43.207
payoff?
Well how are we going to figure

00:52:43.207 --> 00:52:46.730
out what is the payoff?
So the payoff in this mix,

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:51.809
we can actually construct by
looking at the payoff to dove.

00:52:51.809 --> 00:52:53.473
It doesn't really matter
whether you look at the payoff

00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:56.374
to dove or the payoff to hawk.
Let's look at the payoff to

00:52:56.374 --> 00:53:00.230
dove.
So the payoff was what?

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:04.220
It was, if you were dove,
then 1-V/C of the time,

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.959
you met another dove and in
that instance you get a payoff

00:53:08.959 --> 00:53:13.865
of V/2 and it must be the payoff
to being a dove is the same

00:53:13.865 --> 00:53:20.880
since they're mixing.
This is the payoff.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.896
So what's happening to this
payoff as we increase the cost

00:53:27.896 --> 00:53:31.079
of fighting?
What happens as C rises?

00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:38.210
So just to note out,
what happens as C goes up?

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:42.302
So you might think naively,
you might think that if you're

00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:45.174
in a setting,
be it a social evolutionary

00:53:45.174 --> 00:53:49.128
setting or a biology,
a nature evolutionary setting,

00:53:49.128 --> 00:53:53.373
you might think that as the
cost of fighting goes up for you

00:53:53.373 --> 00:53:56.065
guys in society,
or for the ants,

00:53:56.065 --> 00:53:59.297
antelopes, or lions we're
talking about,

00:53:59.297 --> 00:54:03.440
you might think the payoffs in
society go down.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.949
Costs of fighting go up,
more limbs get lost and so on,

00:54:06.949 --> 00:54:10.655
sounds like that's going to be
bad for the overall genetic

00:54:10.655 --> 00:54:14.590
fitness of the species.
But in fact we don't find that.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:20.780
What happens as C goes up?
The payoff goes up.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:27.340
As C goes up,
the payoff goes up.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.905
As we take C bigger,
this begets smaller,

00:54:30.905 --> 00:54:34.590
which means this is bigger.
Everyone see that?

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.739
Just look at that term
(1-V/C)(V/2),

00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:41.460
it's actually increasing in C.
So how does that work?

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:45.186
As the costs of fighting go up,
it's true that if you do fight,

00:54:45.186 --> 00:54:47.469
you're more likely to lose a
finger,

00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:51.601
or a limb, or a claw,
or whatever those things are

00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:56.659
called, or a foot or whatever it
is you're likely to lose.

00:54:56.659 --> 00:55:00.422
But the number of fights that
actually occur in this

00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:04.185
evolutionarily stable mix goes
down and it goes down

00:55:04.185 --> 00:55:07.800
sufficiently much to compensate
you for that.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.315
Kind of a remarkable thing.
So these animals that actually

00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:14.560
are going to lose a lot through
fighting are actually going to

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.380
do rather well overall because
of that mix effect.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.110
I feel like it's one of those
strategic effects.

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.223
Now of course that raises a
question, which is what would

00:55:25.223 --> 00:55:28.503
happen if a particular part of
this species evolved that had

00:55:28.503 --> 00:55:32.329
lower costs of fighting?
It could regrow a leg.

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:36.706
Sounds like that would do
pretty well, and that would be

00:55:36.706 --> 00:55:39.730
bad news for the species as a
whole.

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:42.094
Third thing we can observe here
is what's sometimes called

00:55:42.094 --> 00:55:42.800
identification.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.619
So what does identification
mean here?

00:55:51.619 --> 00:55:54.355
It means that by observing the
data in nature,

00:55:54.355 --> 00:55:58.002
by going out and filming these
animals behaving for hours and

00:55:58.002 --> 00:55:59.997
hours,
or changing their setting in a

00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:02.309
lab and seeing how they
interact, or changing their

00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:04.760
setting in the field and seeing
how they interact,

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.739
we can actually observe
something, namely the proportion

00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:10.085
of fights.
Perhaps we can do better now

00:56:10.085 --> 00:56:13.536
and actually look at their
genetics directly since science

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:17.230
has evolved, and we can actually
back out the V and the C.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:21.928
By looking at the proportion of
hawk genes out there or hawkish

00:56:21.928 --> 00:56:25.565
behavior out there,
we can actually identify what

00:56:25.565 --> 00:56:34.720
must be the ratio of V to C.
We can tell what the ratio V/C

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:41.474
is from looking at data.
We started off with a little

00:56:41.474 --> 00:56:43.802
matrix, I've just written in V's
and C's, I didn't put any

00:56:43.802 --> 00:56:45.958
numbers in there.
We can't tell what V is,

00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:48.971
we can't tell what C is,
but we can tell what the ratio

00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:50.980
is by looking at real world
data.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.928
So if you spend enough hours in
front of the TV watching nature

00:56:53.928 --> 00:56:56.341
shows you could back this out.
Not literally,

00:56:56.341 --> 00:56:59.079
you need to actually do some
serious work.

00:56:59.079 --> 00:57:02.750
So this is a useful input of
theory into empirical science.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.819
You want theory to be able to
set up the science so you can

00:57:05.819 --> 00:57:08.624
back out the unknowns in the
theory: and that's called

00:57:08.624 --> 00:57:12.836
identification,
not just in biology but in

00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:17.006
Economics as well.
Now there's one other thing

00:57:17.006 --> 00:57:20.320
you'd like theory to be other
than identifiable.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.320
You'd like theory to be
testable.

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.963
You'd like theory to make
predictions that were kind of

00:57:26.963 --> 00:57:29.730
outside of the sample you
started with.

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.059
Is what I'm saying familiar to
everyone in the room.

00:57:32.059 --> 00:57:34.964
This is a very familiar idea
I'm hoping to everybody,

00:57:34.964 --> 00:57:37.590
slightly philosophy but a very
familiar idea.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:41.246
You have a new theory.
It's one thing for that theory

00:57:41.246 --> 00:57:45.726
to explain the existing facts,
but you'd like it to predict

00:57:45.726 --> 00:57:46.929
new facts.
Why?

00:57:46.929 --> 00:57:49.713
Because it's a little easy--it
might be a little bit too easy

00:57:49.713 --> 00:57:52.590
to reverse engineer a model or
theory to fit existing facts,

00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:56.912
but if it has to deal with new
facts, that's kind of exciting,

00:57:56.912 --> 00:57:59.619
that's a real test.
Does that make sense?

00:57:59.619 --> 00:58:02.593
So you might ask about this
theory, you might say,

00:58:02.593 --> 00:58:05.750
well it's just a whole bunch of
'just so stories'.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.170
Does anyone know what I mean by
a 'just so story'?

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.800
It's children's stories,
written by Kipling,

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.347
and people sometimes accuse a
lot of evolutionary theory as

00:58:13.347 --> 00:58:16.371
being 'just so stories',
because you know what the fact

00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:19.038
is already, and you reverse the
game, you come up with a story

00:58:19.038 --> 00:58:21.428
afterwards.
That doesn't sound like good

00:58:21.428 --> 00:58:23.832
science.
So you'd like this theory,

00:58:23.832 --> 00:58:27.426
this theory that matches Game
Theory with evolution,

00:58:27.426 --> 00:58:31.019
to predict something that we
hadn't seen before.

00:58:31.019 --> 00:58:34.606
And then we can go out and look
for it, and see if it's there,

00:58:34.606 --> 00:58:36.840
and that's exactly what we now
have.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:43.790
So our last example is a
slightly more complicated game

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:44.820
again.

00:58:54.570 --> 00:59:05.927
The slightly more complicated
game has three strategies and

00:59:05.927 --> 00:59:12.763
the strategies are called,
I'll tell you what the

00:59:12.763 --> 00:59:15.346
strategies are called in a
second actually,

00:59:15.346 --> 00:59:17.929
I'll give you the payoffs first
of all.

00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:22.152
So once again this is a game
about different forms of

00:59:22.152 --> 00:59:26.536
aggression and we'll look at
other interpretations in a

00:59:26.536 --> 00:59:29.937
second.
Once again, V is going to be

00:59:29.937 --> 00:59:34.594
the prize for winning,
0 is going to be the prize for

00:59:34.594 --> 00:59:38.579
losing, and 1 is if it's a tie.
I'm just short sighted enough

00:59:38.579 --> 00:59:39.679
that I can't read my own
writing.

00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:43.340
So I hope I've got this right,
there we go.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:47.845
So this is the game,
and we're going to assume that

00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:51.719
the prize V is somewhere between
1 and 2.

00:59:51.719 --> 00:59:56.162
So V you can think of as
winning, 0 is losing,

00:59:56.162 --> 01:00:00.603
and 1 is if it's a tie.
Does anyone recognize what this

01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:02.932
game essentially is?
It's essentially rock,

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.363
paper, scissors.
And it turns out that when

01:00:05.363 --> 01:00:08.626
biologists play rock,
paper, scissors they give it a

01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:10.994
different name,
they call it "scratch,

01:00:10.994 --> 01:00:13.689
bite, and trample."
Scratch, bite,

01:00:13.689 --> 01:00:18.242
and trample is essentially the
tactics of the Australian

01:00:18.242 --> 01:00:20.537
football team.
So scratch, bite,

01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:23.356
and trample are the three
strategies, and it's a little

01:00:23.356 --> 01:00:25.340
bit like rock,
paper, and scissors.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.034
How do we change it?
First, we added 1 to all the

01:00:28.034 --> 01:00:32.140
payoffs to make sure there are
no negatives in there and second

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.320
we added a little bit more than
1 to winning.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.835
If we added 1 to
everything--sorry,

01:00:36.835 --> 01:00:38.530
a little bit less than 1 to
winning.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:43.406
So if we added 1 to everything
then V would have been 2,

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:47.130
but we kept V somewhere between
1 and 2.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:50.443
So this is certainly a game,
you can imagine in nature,

01:00:50.443 --> 01:00:53.694
there's three possible
strategies for this species and

01:00:53.694 --> 01:00:56.639
the payoff matrix happens to
look like this.

01:00:56.639 --> 01:00:58.699
So where's my prediction going
to come from?

01:00:58.699 --> 01:01:02.421
Well since this is rock,
paper, scissors we know that

01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:06.429
there's really only one hope for
an evolutionarily stable

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.953
strategy.
Since it's essentially rock,

01:01:08.953 --> 01:01:12.140
paper, scissors what would,
if there is an evolutionarily

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.644
stable strategy or
evolutionarily stable mix,

01:01:14.644 --> 01:01:17.659
what must it be?
(1/3,1/3,1/3).

01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:34.957
So the only hope for an ESS is
(1/3,1/3,1/3)--let's put that in

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:40.193
here.
So (1/3,1/3,1/3) and you can

01:01:40.193 --> 01:01:47.699
check at home that that indeed
is a mixed-strategy equilibrium.

01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:54.230
And the question is:
is this evolutionarily stable?

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:57.527
So we know it's a Nash
Equilibrium that I've given you,

01:01:57.527 --> 01:02:00.520
and we know it's not a strict
Nash Equilibrium.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.883
Everyone okay with that?
It can't be a strict Nash

01:02:02.883 --> 01:02:07.861
Equilibrium because it's mixed.
So if this is an ESS it must be

01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:13.378
the case--we'd have to check
that--let's call this P again

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:19.284
like we've been doing--we have
to check that the payoff from P

01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:24.995
against any other P' would have
to be bigger than the payoff

01:02:24.995 --> 01:02:30.950
from P' against itself.
We need that to be the case.

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:43.989
So let P' be scratch.
So let's compare these things.

01:02:43.989 --> 01:02:49.710
So U of P against scratch is
what?

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:54.393
Well you're playing against
scratch, you are 1/3 scratch,

01:02:54.393 --> 01:02:58.383
1/3 bite, 1/3 trample.
So 1/3 of the time you get

01:02:58.383 --> 01:03:02.733
1,1/3 of the time you get
nothing, and 1/3 of the time you

01:03:02.733 --> 01:03:04.170
get V.
Is that right?

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:14.769
So your payoff is (1+V)/3.
How would we do if we're

01:03:14.769 --> 01:03:18.810
scratch against scratch?
The payoff of scratch against

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.365
scratch is what?
No prizes for this,

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:23.290
what's the payoff of scratch
against scratch?

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:31.190
1.
Which is bigger, (1+V)/3 or 1?

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:38.150
Well look, V is less than 2 so
(1+V)/3 is less than 1.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:43.221
So 1 is bigger.
So in this game the only hope

01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:49.161
for an evolutionarily stable mix
was a (1/3,1/3,1/3) and it isn't

01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:51.789
stable.
So here's an example.

01:03:51.789 --> 01:04:00.369
In this example there is no
evolutionarily stable strategy.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.550
There's no evolutionarily
stable mix.

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:07.199
Then the obvious question is,
what does that mean in nature?

01:04:07.199 --> 01:04:10.270
Can we find a setting that
looks like rock,

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:14.000
paper, scissors in nature in
which nothing is ES?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.019
If nothing is ES what's going
to happen?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.599
We're going to see a kind of
cycling around.

01:04:18.599 --> 01:04:22.886
You're going to see a lot of
the scratch strategy,

01:04:22.886 --> 01:04:26.473
followed by a lot of the
trample strategy,

01:04:26.473 --> 01:04:31.110
followed by a lot of the bite
strategy and so on.

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:35.082
So it turns out that's exactly
what you see when you look at

01:04:35.082 --> 01:04:38.179
these, the example I've left you
on the web.

01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:41.361
There's an article in nature in
the mid 90s that looked at a

01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:44.323
certain type of lizard.
And these lizards come in three

01:04:44.323 --> 01:04:45.861
colors.
I forget what the colors are,

01:04:45.861 --> 01:04:47.660
I know I wrote it down.
One is orange;

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.719
one is yellow;
and one is blue.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.920
And these lizards have three
strategies.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.127
The orange lizard is like our
big elephant bull:

01:04:56.127 --> 01:05:00.085
it likes to keep a harem of
many--or a large territory with

01:05:00.085 --> 01:05:03.019
many female lizards in it to
mate with.

01:05:03.019 --> 01:05:07.914
But that can be invaded by our
SLF strategy which turns out to

01:05:07.914 --> 01:05:11.956
be the yellow lizard.
The yellow lizard can invade

01:05:11.956 --> 01:05:15.880
and just mate with a few of
these female lizards.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.469
But when there are too many of
these sneaky yellow lizards,

01:05:19.469 --> 01:05:23.120
then it turns out that they can
be invaded by a blue lizard:

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.400
and the blue lizard has much
smaller territories,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.525
it's almost monogamous.
So what happens in nature is

01:05:31.525 --> 01:05:34.330
you get a cycle,
orange invaded by yellow,

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.820
invaded by blue:
harem keeper invaded by sneaky,

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.110
invaded by monogamous invaded
by harem keeper again.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:44.276
Indeed, the population does
cycle around exactly as

01:05:44.276 --> 01:05:47.190
predicted by the model,
so here's an example of

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:49.648
evolutionary theory,
via Game Theory,

01:05:49.648 --> 01:05:53.110
making a prediction that we can
actually go off and test and

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:54.778
find.
This, for biologists,

01:05:54.778 --> 01:05:58.030
was like finding a black hole,
it's a really cool thing.

01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:00.859
We'll leave evolution here:
mid-term on Wednesday,

01:06:00.859 --> 01:06:04.440
we'll come back to do something
totally different next week.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.906
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.720
good morning.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.010
Today I decided not
to use PowerPoint,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.070
I'm using index cards.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.190
This is traditional
lecture style.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.630
I want to talk today about --

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.370
this is our third lecture
for financial markets.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.935
I wanted to talk today about
invention in finance.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.150
I think of finance, I don't
know whether this will

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.660
encourage you to be interested
or not, but I think of it as a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.640
form of engineering.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.680
Finance is all about
inventions.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.280
Devices that solve problems and
that help people do things

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.070
and get on with their
purposes in life.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.360
And the inventions have
many small details,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.070
just like any invention.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.220
Like an airplane.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.940
You look at an airplane, how
many parts are in there?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.000
How many different people worked
on the different parts?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.610
And it's so complicated that you
might have disbelief that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.410
this whole thing is
going to work, but

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.270
somehow it does work.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.360
And another part that I want
to emphasize in today's

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.060
lecture is that engineering
requires a human element.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.750
Engineers know that their
devices will be run by people,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.190
and people are imperfect.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.070
And so, they have a course in
engineering schools called

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.500
Human Factors Engineering.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.870
And that's about designing
machines, so that human beings

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.740
won't mess up when they
try to use them.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.260
That gets us into psychology.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.250
To me, when we talk about
behavioral finance, which is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.260
going to be a theme of this
course, human psychology and

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.010
finance, it's fundamental to the
inventive side of finance.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.320
So that's what I want
to talk about.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.430
I'm going to give you some
examples of invention and talk

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.330
about how they solve
the risk problem.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.030
The fundamental problem of
maintaining incentives in the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.240
face of risk.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.890
But before I start this lecture,
I wanted to just

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.790
briefly review the last lecture,
which was a very

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.550
important lecture for this
course, because it talked

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.180
about the underlying probability
theory and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.610
applications of probability
theory to finance.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.150
So, let me just mention some of
the concepts that I talked

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.390
about last time.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.600
The first one was return.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.740
We talked about the return on
an investment which has two

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.100
components, the capital gains,
which is the increase in the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.040
price of the investment, and
the other is the dividend,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.660
which is something that comes
separately in the form of a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.410
check maybe, or electronic
entry.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.090
But we then moved quickly
to probability theory.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.300
We talked about random
variables.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.160
A random variable is a quantity
that's created by

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.980
some kind of experiment or event
that is uncertain in

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.310
advance and becomes
known later.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.390
And then, we talked about
measures of probability

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.800
distributions.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.580
We talked about central
tendency, we talked about the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.530
average or mean, and the
geometric average, and we

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.265
talked about measures of
risk, notably variance.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.410
But then, there are also
measures of co-movements

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.000
between two random variables.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.960
We talked about covariance and
correlation, and we talked

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.300
about regression.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.340
And then finally we talked about
distributions of random

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.140
variables, and the normal
distribution, which is famous.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.730
It's the famous bell-shaped
curve, which is thought by

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.430
many people to represent
a typical distribution.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.840
And then finally, we talked
about failures of the --

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.870
the idea of independent random
variables that are normally

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.880
distributed is a
powerful idea.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.210
That we have some idea that
there's a bell-shaped curve.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.630
We know something about what
relates to something and what

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.190
doesn't relate to what.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.670
These ideas are partly
intuitive, and

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.650
they're partly wrong.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.130
And so, the concluding element
of the last lecture was that

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.750
the financial crisis that has
enveloped the world starting

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.360
around 2007 seems to be related
to people's failure to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.930
understand the limits of the
independence assumption they

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.750
were making, and also to the
limits of the normal

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.010
distribution.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.930
Namely, failure to consider
outliers.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.770
So let's just think
about independence

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.830
briefly for a moment.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.800
It's inherent in the intuitive
view we have of the world.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.580
When you toss a coin, every time
you toss it, you think

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.520
each toss has to be
independent of

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.710
the previous toss.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.690
They're not going to come up
the same, because there's

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.900
nothing relating
the two tosses.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.280
So you have a strong intuitive
sense that some events are

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.570
independent.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.520
You might also think that
returns on the stock market

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.780
from day to day are
independent.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.620
Why is that?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.320
Because they relate
to news, right?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.830
What changes the stock
market on any day?

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.470
Its news, and by definition
news has to be new.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.720
So it can't just be
yesterday's news.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.110
So it has to be something
fresh.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.110
And I showed you a plot of the
stock market and of Apple

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.240
stock, and in this plot it came
out that the stocks look

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.810
roughly independent, the returns
from day to day.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.150
But they're not necessarily
independent, and they can

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.180
surprise you, and that's
when crises occur.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.490
We also talked about
idiosyncratic

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.440
risk and market risk.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.840
Remember we regressed Apple
stock's returns on the stock

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.450
market's returns and we got a
fitted value, which was beta

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.170
times the market return.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.400
And that's the market component
of Apple risk.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.420
And then we saw that the extra
component, idiosyncratic, is

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.290
uncorrelated with
the market risk.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.340
But in this case it's
uncorrelated by construction,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.600
so it has to be uncorrelated.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.870
Oh by the way, I don't know
if you caught the news.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.990
It's just coincidence that I
mentioned Apple stock in my

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.620
last lecture.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.120
You must've heard the news.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.460
It was headline news on the
Wall Street Journal.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.120
We had a three-day weekend
because of the Martin Luther

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.290
King holiday in the U.S. and,
over the weekend, Apple

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.280
announced that Steve Jobs is
taking a long leave of absence

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.400
from Apple because
of his health.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.660
And so, we talked about that
Steve Jobs is viewed by a lot

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.920
of people as the genius behind
Apple, and the last time he

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.570
left for a long time Apple
didn't do well.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.960
And so, you wondered what would
happen to the stock.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.350
Well, since they announced it
on a day just before the

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.790
market was closed, and so it
opened in Europe and there was

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.330
a 7% drop in Germany
of Apple shares.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.860
It opened down 5% on Tuesday
in the U.S., but then it

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.180
recovered and it wasn't really
down that much, probably

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.730
because there was good earnings

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.060
news at the same time.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.400
That's just completing our
little story about Apple.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.720
I don't know if I gave enough
emphasis to the central limit

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.113
theorem last lecture.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:32.250
This is a fundamental theorem
from probability theory, which

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:44.890
says that if you have
independent identically

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.770
distributed random variables.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.620
That is, every random variable
is independent of the other,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.050
and they're all of the same
distribution, and if it has a

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:10.930
finite variance, then the
distribution of an average of

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:17.090
these variables converges to the
normal distribution as the

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.510
number of elements in the
average is increased.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.020
In other words, averages are
approximately normally

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.120
distributed.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.910
The bell-shaped curve works as
well as it does, because so

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.350
many things we observe in
nature are averages.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.160
So many things that we observe
are the sum of many affects.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.270
This is what history
is all about.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.070
Anytime big events occur, it's
probably because a number of

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.470
things chanced to happen
at the same time.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.480
And that's why probability
Theorists think that we kind

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.450
of know the probability
distribution, and that's this

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:02.640
bell-shaped curve which I had
on the slide last period.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.420
The critical thing about the
bell-shaped curve is that the

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.720
tails drop off really fast,
after you get a certain

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.520
distance up on either end.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.710
They essentially hit zero.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.750
They never hit zero.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.860
The probability is never zero.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:22.200
Anything can happen with a
normally distributed variable.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:29.880
But the normal distribution
does not have fat tails.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.440
After two or three or four
standard deviations, basically

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.190
the probability is zero
that that kind

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.500
of thing will happen.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.230
That a return --

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.070
if we're applying
it to returns,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.760
that that would occur.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.480
So, the problem with the central
limit theorem is that

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.900
it's only as good as
its assumptions.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.950
And it assumes that the
underlying variables have a

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.140
finite variance, that they
themselves are not so

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.220
fat-tailed that the variance
of them in infinite.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.850
And in fact, that assumption
might be wrong, because we

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.390
see, especially in finance, we
see big outliers coming from

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.640
time to time.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.920
And so I present a theory, and
I must say I like the theory.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.480
The central limit theory is an
important theory, but it's

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.550
also wrong.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.030
And that's the problem with
financial theory.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.070
It's not quite as good as the
theory that physicists or

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.950
chemists use.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.550
It has its limitations.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.850
Nonetheless, that's what
we have to talk about.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.665
We have to make do with that
as much as we can.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.980
I'm almost done with my review
of the last lecture.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.650
I wanted to just correct
what I said.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.880
I said that fat-tailed
distributions were discovered

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.540
by Benoit Mandelbrot,
but that's --

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.405
I have to give credit
properly.

00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:08.320
It's actually his teacher,
so I've got this now.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:23.710
Paul Pierre Levy was a
mathematician who lived from

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.400
1886 to 1971, who really first
developed a theory of

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.570
fat-tailed distribution.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:38.760
And he was at the Ecole
Polytechnique in France.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:46.890
And his student was Benoit
Mandelbrot, who was one of the

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.690
great mathematicians --

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.260
they're both among the great
mathematicians of the

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.510
twentieth century.

00:12:56.726 --> 00:13:00.630
Our knowledge of fat-tailed
distributions comes down to us

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.030
through word of mouth.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.570
From Levy, who was Mandelbrot's
teacher, to

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.590
Mandelbrot, to me, and
then to you, I think.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.780
So, we don't require any printed
word to know this.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.370
That's the way the history
of thought goes.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.270
There's an old joke about
the normal distribution.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.180
The joke goes as follows.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:31.790
The mathematicians think that
the normal distribution is

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.390
ubiquitous in nature, because
applied workers have

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.140
discovered that everything
is normally distributed.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.140
But applied workers think that
the normal distribution is

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.620
ubiquitous in nature, because
mathematicians have proved

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.040
that it's ubiquitous
in nature.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.000
In fact, it's sort of
ubiquitous, but it sort of

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.880
surprises you.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.530
And that's one of the

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.080
fundamental lessons in finance.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.040
The fundamental lesson in
finance is that you might go

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.900
through years observing some
random return, or some random

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.040
variable in finance, and you
kind of think you know how it

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.890
behaves, and you've learned
some confidence.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.830
There will come a day when
it defies all of your

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.660
expectations, and that's what
fat-tails are all about.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.570
OK, I want it to move on now to
today's lecture, which is

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.440
about invention, and

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.575
particularly financial invention.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.800
How should I start here?

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:55.900
Let me start by recalling
how much finance has

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:03.830
changed since 1970.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.780
OK, that's 40 years ago.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:15.530
In 1970, there were no
options exchanges.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.040
Well, there were options,
but they were not

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.870
traded on any exchange.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.340
There were no financial
futures.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.470
There were no swaps.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.890
I haven't defined what these
things are for you.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.420
What else did they not have?

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:46.840
They didn't have electronic
trading.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.630
They would do trading
by word of mouth.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.810
They would meet together on the
floor of an exchange and

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.710
shout at each other and talk.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.320
I guess they had telephones,
but it was all words and

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.490
people and writing on paper.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:10.410
So, the proliferation of
financial instruments in 40

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.460
years is stunning.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.870
So I wanted to use that as a
springboard to think about

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.150
what is the next 40 years
going to be like?

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.760
And if any of you go
into finance, this

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.500
would be your career.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.290
I think that it's reasonable
to suppose that the

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.330
transformation that we see in
the next 40 years is going to

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.340
be just as dramatic as the last
40, or more so, because

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.890
technical progress doesn't
slow down.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.830
I don't see any reason to think
that it's slowing down.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.470
So, I like to think about the
future, but it's hard to talk

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.280
about the future, because
we're not there yet.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.490
I've written a couple
of books.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.420
One of them is about the
future of finance.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.900
One of them is called Macro
Markets, which I wrote in 1993

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.940
about the big market.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.300
Macro means big markets that
we'll be seeing in the future.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.620
And the other one was called The
New Financial Order, which

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.420
I wrote in 2003, and we have the
introductory chapter there

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.850
on the reading list
for this lecture.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.360
What I see as happening
with all of these --

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.100
Incidentally, we have a lot
of questioning of these

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.840
inventions now, because they
kind of blew up on us in this

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.520
financial crisis.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.930
So, it's a little bit like
after an airplane crash.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.100
People are kind of critical
of the aeronautical

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.490
engineers for a while.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.850
Or when they invented steam
engines, some of them blew up,

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.020
and it was bad.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.050
You know, when a boiler blows
up, it scalds all the people

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.300
around it, awful.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.140
So people were mad at
them for a while.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.810
I think that's what we're
going through now.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:07.020
And people are angry about some
of these inventions, but

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.540
that's just part of progress.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.620
Well, it doesn't mean that we
don't want to regulate them.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.560
We regulate boilers and
airplanes right now to prevent

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.980
crashes, and we need to regulate
our financial markets

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.230
just as well.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:42.610
The financial markets that
we have, they're based on

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.970
mathematical models.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.950
This is a mathematical
discipline, but the

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:52.270
mathematical models depend only
on certain intuition.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.440
Maybe, a core part of the
intuition that underlies

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.865
financial inventions is the
idea of independence.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.760
I'm going to try and talk in
really basic terms. If risks

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.440
are independent of each other,
then we can pool

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.630
them and they go away.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.050
That's the core idea.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.220
But how to make that happen,
requires some thought, and

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.900
some devices.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.230
The intuitive idea that we can
exploit independence to

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.290
improve our lives goes back to
ancient times, actually.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.220
A lot of things that people do
are done in recognition of

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.260
what is independent
and what is not.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.050
I think, even the big causes
that people get emotional

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.280
about over the ages
are causes that --

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.240
I can think of them as examples
of the application of

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.710
probability theory in
modern finance.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.630
So, you might not agree with me,
but this is my view of it.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.660
Think of socialism.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.210
What is socialism?

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.430
Well, you know it was invented
by the philosopher,

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.930
entrepreneur Robert Owen.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.490
The word was invented
by him in the

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.350
early nineteenth century.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.870
What is it?

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:15.320
It is that society gets together
and pools all of its

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.200
activities.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.080
I think, well, why would
you want to do that?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.530
One reason you'd do that is
that it improves human

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.330
welfare, because it shares
risks, and we're all in it

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.180
together, and, you know, we
won't have rich and poor.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.420
I think that's part of
Robert Owens' idea.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.980
He was worried about inequality,
that some people

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.870
are much better off than others,
and that's bad, and so

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.760
let's create a socialist
society.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.240
So, he had an invention of
sorts, but it didn't seem to

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.750
be a very --

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.780
in his form is was not a very
successful invention, because

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.260
it didn't work somehow.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.410
He set up a town called New
Harmony in the United States,

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.040
which was supposed to be
harmonious, by the name of the

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.570
town, and everything
was shared.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.420
And unfortunately, they ended
up arguing and fighting

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.470
amongst each other, and
they were not happy.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.310
He didn't get it figured
out right.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.140
He was trying to pool risk,
but he didn't do it.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.360
There are other idealistic
societies that try to do it,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.620
like the kibbutzim in Israel.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.570
That's one of many where people
get together and form a

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.050
community, and they pool
everything, and it kind of

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.730
works for some people.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.660
But only a tiny fraction of the
population in Israel lives

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.370
on a kibbutz now.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.160
Why not?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.300
I think most people just
don't fit in that way.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.370
We share everything.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.160
After a few months living
there you might

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.170
think, I'm out of here.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.666
I don't want to share everything
with everybody.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.890
So, people do things.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:55.010
In the Old West, the pioneers in
America, they had a kind of

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.910
a social contract, that, if
one farmer's house burned

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.820
down, everyone will come by and
help and erect a new house

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.970
for that person.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.720
So that's, again,
risk management.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.570
That's it.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.610
And it works.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.680
It sounds almost like a moral
thing, but it works only,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.010
because they don't all burn
down at the same time.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.570
It would be totally worthless
if they all did.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.500
And so, there are primitive
ideas of insurance that

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.320
underlie that, but the ideas
aren't worked out well.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.560
And it doesn't perhaps work
well to do it on such an

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.850
informal basis.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:33.310
So, our society has particular
inventions that, we call them

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.820
financial or insurance
inventions, that make these

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.070
things work better.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.430
What we're talking about is
motivated by theory, the

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.720
mathematical theory of finance,
but that's not the

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.510
subject of this course.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.400
I want to in this course talk
more about the inventions

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:03.000
themselves and in particular
we'll be talking about risk

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.410
management.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.745
Now, this brings up a basic
issue about finance.

00:23:08.745 --> 00:23:11.300
Is finance good?

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.900
Is it helpful to people?

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:19.940
You know, a huge issue in the
history of humankind is

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.170
inequality.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:25.560
And that people get upset when
it seems like other people

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.270
have an unfair advantage
over us.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.790
But inequality is something that
you'd think finance works

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.610
against. Modern finance is
about risk management.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.020
So, you can get rid of the
purely random elements in

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.660
people's lives, that should
make people more equal.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.640
It should be a good thing.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.490
That is the way I view it.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.680
But the other side of finance
is that it also creates

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.380
opportunity, and opportunity
is very important also.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.410
We can all be equal and living
in poverty, and we don't

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.370
particularly like that.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:05.390
So that's why financial
inventions eventually inspire

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.350
and get people excited.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.460
I always remember Deng
Xiaoping's famous statement in

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.110
the late 1970's, when
China was adopting

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.700
modern financial methods.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:22.300
And some people were getting
rich, and someone asked Deng,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.390
isn't this inconsistent
with our ideology?

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.150
And he said, well, and I'm
quoting approximately, we're

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.350
all going to get rich, but
somebody has to get rich

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.750
first. And that's
the way it is.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.140
Financial markets
do manage risk.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.380
But they also create
opportunities and that can

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.960
actually increase inequality.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.790
So, you have to consider
both sides of it.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.120
Maybe the most important
concept in

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.300
finance really is risk.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:05.610
And risk is all about limiting
inequality, or at least the

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:11.740
random, gratuitous inequality,
right?

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:19.120
People are troubled by
inequality if it's arbitrary,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.350
but, you know, most people
wouldn't begrudge someone who

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:27.470
works very hard and shows real
genius and insight, and makes

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.215
a lot of money, most people
say that's all right.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:39.250
Part of the way we deal with
risk is our taxes, tax and

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.500
welfare system.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.550
I'm going to come back to that,
mostly in our second to

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.800
last lecture.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.640
We have a progressive income
tax that taxes rich people

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.250
more, and we have welfare.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.320
And we also have, I should
add, it's not counted as

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.540
welfare, but free public
education, which is a form of,

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.130
I wouldn't call it welfare,
but it's an equalizing

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.710
expenditure.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.060
These are actually our
most important

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.690
risk management devices.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.510
That's what makes life tolerable
in modern society,

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:24.140
that we do have progressive
taxes and welfare.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.490
But we don't rely on
those exclusively.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.860
And so, finance is getting into
the other dimensions.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.390
And we kind of want to let
insurance, private insurance,

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.220
rather than social insurance,
flourish.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.710
Because when the government
handles everything, it doesn't

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:46.450
seem to work as effectively or
creatively as it can if we let

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.970
private entrepreneurs
handle things.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:59.890
So, what we're talking about
here, and to always put it in

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.640
perspective, what we're talking
about in this course,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:09.440
is about something that is an
add-on to an existing welfare

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.900
and tax system.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.410
But an add-on that is, we hope,
particularly effective.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:22.280
And it's added-on by people in
their own self-interest, or

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.700
maybe for their own purposes,
but something that ultimately

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.110
contributes to a, I think,
a better world.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.400
That's what I want to.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.970
I have several themes
in this lecture.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.670
The first is a risk theme, which
I've just discussed.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.710
Another theme I want to talk
about here is a framing theme.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.330
Psychologists use the term
framing to refer to the

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:07.790
context and associations that
we have with some thing.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:15.210
So, the way people use things
depends on what they see them

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:22.210
associated with, because people
can't think through to

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.540
the fundamental theory
all the time.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.430
So, we have to frame things
in a way that's

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.690
convenient to people.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.040
And this is part of financial
engineering.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.200
I'll come back to that
in a minute.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.480
Framing has to do with
language, names

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.010
that we give to things.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:48.020
We have to design inventions,
so that they're

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.380
framed in good ways.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.760
I'll explain that in a minute.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.130
And then, I have a device theme,
that finance is really

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:01.560
about devices like
steam engines.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.340
We call them financial
contracts.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:16.160
Devices are complicated
structures that we set up for

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.740
a certain purpose, like
airplanes or automobiles, and

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:30.170
we learn through time how to
make them better and better.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:35.680
And they tend to come
on the world with

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.780
a flourish or surprise.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.790
There's some new invention.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.950
You know, when the Wright
Brothers first exhibited the

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.740
airplane in the Paris
Air Show in 1904, I

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.770
think, people were stunned.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.250
They were actually flying.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.550
And it immediately set
up around the world

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.385
the aircraft industry.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.770
If you look around
the world, these

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.080
devices look very similar.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.150
Automobiles, airplanes
they look almost the

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.300
same in every country.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.160
But that's because they have an
internal logic to them that

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.300
makes them work well.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.810
And the logic may not
be apparent to you.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.180
You might not, probably don't,
fully understand why a device

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.580
works as well as it does.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.740
Well, I have an example
of a simple invention.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.770
I was curious, I haven't used
this example before, how many

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.620
of you use this invention?

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.430
You know what a gimlet is?

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.150
How many of you own a gimlet?

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.820
Nobody.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.480
Nobody owns a gimlet.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480
Can someone tell me
what a gimlet is?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.350
It's amazing.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.340
A gimlet is a simple tool
that everyone used to

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.080
have 100 years ago.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.750
And what does it look like?

00:31:14.972 --> 00:31:17.100
It's made out of wire.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.620
This is a handle.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.250
OK, do you have a gimlet
now that I've drawn

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.500
a picture of it?

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.790
So what you did with those --
they were really cheap.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:41.700
You could buy one in 1820,
go to a hardware store in

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.680
downtown New Haven.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.100
They'd have a whole
set of them.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.590
And you use it to make holes.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.000
And it works really well.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.640
I find you can buy them
on the internet.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.050
I bought one out of curiosity,
and now I use it.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:57.840
The point it that inventions
come and go.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.870
The nice thing about a gimlet
is, it's really nice, it comes

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.530
to a pin point.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.220
And if you want to make a hole
in wood, you just push it in,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.230
and it goes exactly
where you want it.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.780
And then you just turn
it a little bit and

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.350
it goes right in.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.610
But we have electric
drills now, right?

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.110
We're kind of used to them.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.230
The problem, you know, once
you start using a

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.680
gimlet, you love it.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.920
Because you can control
it so well.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.230
That drill, when you start
drilling, it kind of bounces

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.110
around, and it doesn't make the
hole where you want it.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:37.000
So, there's something good
about this invention.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.430
But you can go out and buy one
now for very little money on

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.240
the internet.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.350
It'll be mailed to you.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.700
Now that I have it, I'm thinking
about it all the time

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.720
for using it.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.750
But somehow it comes and goes.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.690
Inventions are part of our
culture that appear and

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.995
disappear through time.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.340
I wanted to talk about
another invention.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.910
This is by way of inspiration.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.830
I'm getting to finance in a
minute, but I have to do

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.100
these simple --

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.880
Maybe someone will reintroduce
the gimlet.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.940
I don't know.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.160
It's probably gone forever.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.740
It illustrates the fact that
modern electronic technology

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.140
has given us something
maybe better.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.700
But if you were used to using
this, you'd want it.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.060
You know, I just don't want to
use that electric drill,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.660
because I know how to use this,
and I can control it.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.860
I'll give you another example
of an important invention

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.060
which I saw come in
my lifetime and

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.310
that's wheeled suitcases.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.210
OK, I bet you have
one of these.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.830
Right, a suitcase with
wheels on it?

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.990
When I was a boy there
were absolutely none.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.200
Nowhere.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.630
No one had a wheeled suitcase.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:58.820
Isn't that strange?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.770
You'd be carrying these
suitcases around.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:06.230
You put it on wheels, and
so I looked up the

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.776
inventors of this.

00:34:08.776 --> 00:34:10.250
It's not that long ago.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.510
The wheeled suitcase
was invented by

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:30.210
Bernard Sadow in 1972.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.900
And his was the first one.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.240
He had a suitcase with little
wheels, four little wheels,

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.940
and you had a strap and you'd
pull it, and it would trail

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.570
behind you.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.070
But then the other, the really
important invention, was by

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.430
Robert Plath.

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.006
This isn't finance, but I kind
of think of it as finance.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.600
It was 1991.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.210
And he called it
the RollAboard.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.260
This is what you own, right?

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.580
You own a RollAboard, right?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.450
It has a rigid handle that
collapses into the suitcase,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.380
and has two wheels that
are horizontal.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.880
The problem with Bernard Sadow's
invention is that it

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.920
tended to flop over.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.840
You're pulling it with a strap
behind you, and then you look

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.520
back and it's flopped over.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.690
You can't go around
corners very well.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:23.770
So, we lived with Sadow's
for 19 years.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:29.900
It took 19 years to invent
the modern RollAboard.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.340
I actually heard from
Bernard Sadow.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.560
I wrote about him in The
New Financial Order.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.810
And I got a letter from him
about two weeks ago,

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:39.230
or email from him.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.760
And he said, I heard about your
book and that you talked

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.860
about me in your book.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.460
And he said you he'd
like to get me to

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.030
autograph it for him.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.950
So I said fine, I'll
send you the book.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.580
And I sent him an autograph
with appreciation.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.020
That just shows, it's
not long ago.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.550
So I guess, I could ask you to
reflect, why didn't people

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:01.800
have wheeled suitcases?

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.420
But you weren't born
yet, right, so you

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.640
can't reflect on it.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.960
I'm thinking back to myself.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.090
You know, it's almost something

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.230
that I would do myself.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.700
I would put wheels on it.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.950
But I guess you were
embarrassed

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.860
to do it back then.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.270
Because maybe it seemed sissy.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.310
But was everybody worried
about being a sissy?

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.010
Not everybody.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.710
Why didn't anybody do it?

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.165
Well, Bernard Sadow, I had my
student interview him, and he

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:31.380
had listened to objections, and
people told him in 1972,

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.610
no one's going to buy that.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.830
Because if the suitcase is too
heavy, you just get a redcap.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.080
You know what a redcap is?

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.840
A redcap is someone, a poorly
paid person, who stands around

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.720
at train stations, with wearing
a red cap, and helps

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.230
you with your luggage.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.960
Right?

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.380
That's not a good
answer, right?

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.700
There isn't always a redcap to
help you, and so obviously you

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.100
need wheels on suitcases.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.610
But this illustrates how
technology moves.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.320
It moves sometimes slowly.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.840
I'll give you a couple other
examples from my book about

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.800
the slowness of inventions.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.080
One is just the invention
of wheels.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.150
Did you know that in the
Americas before Columbus there

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.030
were no wheels?

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.880
No wheeled vehicles.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.400
The American Indians had no
wheeled vehicles at all, not

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.320
even suitcases.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.770
Nothing.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:25.790
No wagons.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.150
Nothing.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.310
And then to complicate it,
they've discovered, from the

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.280
late classical period in Mexico,
they've discovered

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.770
wheeled toys.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.450
And if you go to a museum in
Mexico you can see them.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.060
They made toys for their kids.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.170
They're not cars, they're little
jaguars and animals,

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.050
and you could roll them
along the floor.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.680
So they made the toys,
why didn't they

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.630
think of making a wagon?

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.310
It just never occurred
to them.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.610
And another example I give in my
book that I really like is

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.420
the movie subtitle.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.480
This is an amazing thing.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.710
When they invented movies --

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.120
I gave you a Thomas Edison
sound movie,

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.430
but it didn't work.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.900
He couldn't make
a sound movie.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.760
They didn't find out
how to make sound

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.930
movies until the 1920's.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.880
So they did, in order to give
dialogue to a movie, they'd

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.030
give what they called
intertitles.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.890
They would show the movie,
you know what I'm saying?

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.910
Then they'd stop the movie and
there would be a title with

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.050
some phrase that someone
said, and then it would

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.300
go back to the movie.

00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:28.680
But it's obviously better just
to put subtitles on the bottom

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.510
of the screen, right?

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.330
Let the movie proceed.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.100
You've seen movies with
subtitles, right?

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.610
It works fine.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.470
Well, it turns out that someone
tried it in 1920.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.100
There was a movie called
The Chamber Mystery.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:45.050
And someone made us a subtitled
silent movie, but

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.780
the response was bad.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.900
It seemed like nobody
liked it.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.880
And so, it wasn't
for another --

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.420
subtitles didn't come
in until after

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.740
sound movies were invented.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.530
After sound movies were
invented, they wanted to make

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.660
movies in one language and show
them in another country,

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.210
so they had to put subtitles in,
so that people in another

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.300
country could see the movie.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.100
And then that's how
it came in.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.050
There's a slowness
to understand

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.690
or appreciate invention.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:21.080
Anyway, I want to move to
invention in finance, and the

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.490
analogies that I just talked
about are important.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:29.200
So let me start with an
important invention in finance

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.970
that goes way back.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.930
Well, I think I mentioned last
time, the very simple idea of

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.740
setting up a company and
dividing up shares in the

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.880
company, that's a really
old invention.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.760
That's thousands of years old.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.380
All right, you and your friends
are going to do a

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.170
business, how do we divide
up the profits?

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.930
Well, let's give shares
to each of us.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.820
And the guy who's contributing
more gets more shares, right?

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.500
And someone who's contributing
less gets less shares.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.030
But then, we all have an
incentive to make the company

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:12.930
go, and that's the idea
of a corporation.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.670
Corporation comes from
the Latin word

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.970
corpus, which is body.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:24.950
It becomes like a slave owned
mutually by all the people in

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.150
the company.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.390
And your share in the company is
determined by the number of

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.230
shares that you own.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.520
But I wanted to focus here
-- that's an old idea.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.760
It's an invention.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.140
But I wanted to really
focus on a

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.360
particular nuance that developed.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.409
It's limited liability.

00:40:53.566 --> 00:40:58.950
A limited liability corporation
is a corporation

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:05.110
that guarantees that you as a
shareholder will not be liable

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.000
for the debts of the company.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.370
In England, they sometimes
will put limited.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.030
The name of the company, after
it we'll say limited.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.360
But in the U.S., we just say
incorporated, so that tells

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.800
you that it's limited
liability.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.390
What it's talking about, limited
liability means that

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:31.190
somebody's sues the company,
and the company can't pay,

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.050
they can't go after
the stockholders.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.370
limited liability has kind
of a complicated history.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:45.670
But according to a history by
David Moss, who was a Yale

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:50.770
history graduate student when
he wrote this, but is now at

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:56.500
Harvard Business School, limited
liability really took

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:06.530
hold in 1811 with a corporate
law in the state of New York

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:11.130
which represented a significant
invention.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:15.630
The corporate law of New York
in 1811 actually had two

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.730
important components.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.210
The first component was,
anybody can start a

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.460
corporation.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.310
Just file the papers with the
government of New York, and

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.890
you've got a corporation.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:33.230
There may have been some
regulatory requirements, but

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.700
the point was, you didn't need
an act of congress, or an act

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.425
of parliament, to start
a corporation.

00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:42.520
It used to be very hard to
start a company, because

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.870
people would say, well,
what's your purpose?

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.730
And you know, we don't just
do this automatically.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.950
That was the first part of
the New York law in 1811.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.470
But the second part is
particularly interesting.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:59.190
They said under no circumstances
can the

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.140
shareholders be sued.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.200
You put in your money to
the company, that's it.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.800
You are protected by the law.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.070
No worries about that.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.100
Now, this was the first
corporate law in the world,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.310
according to Moss, that imposed
limited liability as a

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.770
clear right of the
shareholder.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.070
There were limited liability
clauses before, but it was

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.750
never so crystal clear.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:31.950
At the same time, around 1811,
other states in the United

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.800
States were looking at New York
and saying, you're crazy.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.950
What are you doing?

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.550
You can't sue the
shareholders?

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.430
They could do something
irresponsible.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.690
And so, the state of
Massachusetts, at around the

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.360
same year, made a completely
opposite law.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.970
They made it clear that the
shareholders are responsible.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.990
You invest in a company,
you're responsible.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.860
And that's the only way it's
fair, they thought.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.610
Well, guess what happened?

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.840
New York became the financial
center of America.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.770
Nobody wanted to set up a
company in Massachusetts

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.950
anymore, because they couldn't
raise money.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:16.030
The capitalists were at risk.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.640
If you bought one share in a
company in Massachusetts, and

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.660
the company did something
criminal, let's say, or bad, I

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.360
don't know, something bad, then
they come, they might sue

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.470
the company, and then come
looking for anybody who is

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:30.330
among the shareholders.

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.650
You owned one share in the
company, so we can take

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.920
everything from you.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.870
We can take your house,
your car.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.280
Well, you didn't have a car.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.500
Take whatever you have. So the
rule was, be really careful

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.020
before you invest
in any company.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.210
And you've got to watch
them all the time.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.560
But you know what that did?

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.020
That kept Massachusetts down.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.920
Because nobody wanted
to do that.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.440
I mean you'd only invest
with trusted friends.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.030
You'd never invest in just
some random company.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:59.150
But what happened in New York
was that companies started

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:02.360
appearing rapidly
because of this.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.860
And as many critics said, a
lot of these companies are

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.280
fly-by-night, they're going to
go under, we're going to find

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.930
out that they weren't doing
a good business.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.542
They were just show-offs.

00:45:13.542 --> 00:45:16.360
And they go bankrupt.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.520
But some of those companies did
extremely well, and they

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.040
created a powerful
New York economy.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.550
Then people learned, well, you
could invest in 100 companies.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:29.980
And 99 of them will go under.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.630
They're all wild.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.550
Not all of them.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.810
There's one of them that
would be the Walmart

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.000
and make you rich.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.750
So, the example set by New York
was eventually copied by

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.790
Massachusetts, by every state in
the United States, by every

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.720
country in Europe, and now every
country in the world.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:57.810
See, it was an experiment that
might not have gone well.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.190
You know what David Moss
thought, and this has to do

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.790
with framing again.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.800
Moss thought that, why is it
that New York became such a

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.020
capital of finance?

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.460
Because of this law.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.150
And because it made
investing fun.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.290
And this is a matter
of framing.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:19.240
Moss emphasized that when you
buy share in a company, and

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.160
it's limited liability, you know
that you have already put

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.250
out all the money that
you'll ever put out.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.985
But you could get an infinite
amount, well, there's no limit

00:46:28.985 --> 00:46:31.590
to the amount of money
on the upside.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:36.200
And he thought that just
framed better as a

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.850
psychologically appealing
gamble.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.570
It's like a lottery ticket.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.110
People like lottery
tickets, right?

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.700
They just enjoy the thought.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.780
I don't do this, but
apparently a lot

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.690
of people do it.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.100
You go and you spend a dollar
for a lottery ticket, or two

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.830
dollars for a lottery ticket,
and then you think, tonight I

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.610
could be a millionaire,
all right?

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.820
That's just so much fun that
you want to do it again.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.780
But if the lottery ticket said,
well you have a small

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.220
probability of being a
millionaire, but you also have

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.550
a small probability
of going bankrupt.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.240
We're going to come after
you and take everything.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.090
You wouldn't like that.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.480
That wouldn't be so much fun.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:19.600
You like to savor the
possibility of getting rich.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.750
And so, people flock
to these stocks.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.740
It's like a sport.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:29.670
It's an invention of something
fun to do for a lot of people.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.730
But it has this productive side
to it that it funnels

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.730
capital to where it's needed.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.350
So, that was an important
invention.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:44.360
I want to give you another
example that is a

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.460
variation on this.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.690
I'm going to move
forward in time.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.490
My next invention is the--uh,
I'm breaking chalk here.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.100
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: This
goes now to China, Township

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:14.500
and Village Enterprise or TVE.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.940
I'll try to say it in Chinese.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:22.770
Xiang zhen qi ye, did
I say that right?

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.850
Close anyway.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:28.140
So what was this?

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:33.050
When China emerged from a
communist, strictly communist

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:38.300
state, in the early
period in the --

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.370
maybe starting in the late '70s,
but more in the 1980's,

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:46.740
the Chinese economy increasingly
became built on a

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:53.240
certain kind of organization
called a township or TVE.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.260
And the TVE was like a company,
a corporation, except

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:03.030
that it always involved
the town.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.990
So in other words, if you wanted
to start a business,

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:10.850
making something, making toys
for export to the world, you

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.050
wouldn't just start
a toy company.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.890
You would go to the mayor of
your town, and you'd talk to

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.010
the mayor and say, I want to
start a toy company as this

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.810
town's enterprise, and I want to
share the profits with you,

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.870
with the whole town.

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.500
Now, this is kind of unique.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.260
Well, I don't know if it's
unique, but we don't see this

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.380
in the United States.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.790
But it proliferated.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:39.530
It was actually the invention
that led to initial successes

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.850
of the Chinese economy.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:47.580
By 1985, I believe, I have the
statistics here, there were 12

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.720
million TVEs in China.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:58.290
By the mid-1990's, most of the
industrial production of China

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.550
was done by TVE.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.520
So then you have to ask why --

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.960
this is an invention,
but we don't

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.170
see it in other countries.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.140
Why in China?

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:13.450
Well, people who look back on it
think that it was inventing

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:18.920
around certain constraints
at the time in China.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.010
And that the invention got
around a legal constraint.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:27.610
That China, having been a
communist country, did not

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.760
have all these financial
lawyers.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:36.070
And they did not have courts
that enforced legal contracts

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.630
the way we do in the U.S.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:44.440
And that entrepreneurs in China
were inhibited from

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.420
starting an enterprise, because
they thought it would

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.270
just be usurped by
the village.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.970
You live in a village, you start
a toy company, as soon

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.670
as you start making money,
they'll just put a tax on you.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.340
They'll take it.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.620
That was your worry.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.030
So you had to involve them.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:06.040
It was a fact of life, a very
important fact of life.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.755
You had to involve the
whole community.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.900
You could not start
a business without

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.480
involving the community.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.510
But it was a very successful
invention, because it actually

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:30.275
led the Chinese economy on
its first huge successes.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:38.360
I'm going to move to another
example now of an innovation

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.590
in finance.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:47.380
I want to talk about inflation
indexation.

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:55.890
And I can pick many.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.500
These are examples that
I like personally.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.870
There's an infinite number
of examples.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.360
It doesn't matter exactly
which example we pick.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:10.830
But there's a fundamental
financial problem, and that is

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.890
that the value of money
changes through time.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:17.990
We have inflation measured by
a Consumer Price Index.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.760
And when inflation proceeds, the
prices go up, and so the

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.030
buying power of money
goes down.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.390
And it's uncertain.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:37.720
There's inflation risk that
we face because of the

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.340
uncertainty about prices.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.780
This is an inflation risk that's
under concern right now

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.310
after the quantitative easing
that the Fed --

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:47.590
We'll come back to that.

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:52.670
The Federal Reserve is expanding
the money supply

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.560
dramatically in an effort to
deal with this crisis, and

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.880
some people are worried
about inflation risk.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.530
But it's a longstanding worry.

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.190
It goes way back in time.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:17.920
Most debts are done in nominal
terms. And that means they're

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.980
written in currency units, and
if the currency becomes

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.920
worthless, you're wiped out.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.180
Why do people write contract
in currency units?

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.540
Well, it's because it's familiar
with them, and so

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.680
it's framing.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:39.340
We're used to thinking in terms
of money and so we write

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.430
contracts in terms of
money all the time.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:48.620
So the idea is, maybe we should
start something else.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.860
Let's not write contracts in
terms of money, let's write in

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.730
terms of something else.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.500
And that's an invention.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.970
But it's another invention
that seems obvious.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.725
Let's index our debts to some
measure of inflation.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:12.670
The invention I want to talk
about first goes back to 1780.

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:17.670
I believe that the first indexed
bond was issued in the

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:24.410
state of Massachusetts in 1780
by the Massachusetts

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.660
government.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.484
And that was an indexed bond.

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.640
They defined a consumer price
index, they didn't call it

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:47.620
that, and they said that the
bond would pay you so many

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.810
pounds, they weren't using
dollars yet, they were using

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:54.975
pounds, British pounds, and the
amount of pounds you would

00:54:54.975 --> 00:54:59.910
get would be increased if
inflation were to start.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.390
So, they defined an index
of commodities

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:04.750
that you might purchase.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:12.360
And that index was used to input
a formula that created

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.510
inflation correction
to the bonds.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:21.840
So, these bonds were
issued in 1780.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.030
And it served an important
purpose, because the U.S. was

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:28.390
fighting a war with the United
Kingdom at the time, and there

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:30.700
was tremendous inflation.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.690
So they were very important.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:36.910
But after the war, after the
Revolutionary War ended, they

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.830
stopped issuing these bonds, and
they forgot about them in

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:45.070
the United States until 1997.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.390
It's amazing.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.670
Why did the invention
disappear?

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.750
It's like gimlets.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.160
I think maybe gimlets will
make a reappearance.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.230
Maybe some of you will
buy a gimlet.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:59.600
They're very cheap,
by the way.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.850
And very useful.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.600
It seems like there's a
psychological barrier toward

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.450
adopting something that's a
little bit complicated.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:16.180
And people have trouble
understanding index bonds, and

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:26.500
they have trouble
understanding,

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.060
how the formula works.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.930
They think, you know,
I just want money.

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:37.040
But, then you ask, well, why
didn't people learn?

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.050
If you look through history,
we've had bouts of inflation

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.260
so many times, in so many
different countries.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.380
And you know, if you buy a
nominal bond, it's risky,

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.980
especially if you buy
a 30-year bond.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.710
People are doing that even
today all over the world.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:54.210
They buy these 30-year bonds
denominated in dollars or

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:58.240
euros or some other currency,
and what's going to happen to

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.760
those currencies?

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.850
So, why don't you denominate
your bond in

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.980
something more realistic?

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:08.990
Well, after 1997, the
introduction in United States

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:14.060
of index bonds, the
reintroduction in 1997, seem

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.800
to be started by one person.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.410
Larry Summers, who is Assistant
Treasury Secretary,

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:21.020
just believed in this.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.220
And he did it.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.670
And so, we still have them.

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:27.650
It got up to over 10%
of the U.S. debt.

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:33.260
Now, under Bush and Obama,
they're kind of letting them

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.900
sag now, they're down to
6% of the U.S. debt.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.160
But it really should
be 100% of the U.S.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.210
debt should be indexed.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:45.370
So, this is a kind of example
of progress that is made

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:46.480
gradually through time.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.070
And maybe you'll see that
in the next 40 years.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.440
I'm trying to think of how we
can make these things happen.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:58:01.470
That's an agenda for people,
younger people who can start

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.003
innovating and changing
our financial system.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.490
I wanted to talk about an
invention that particularly

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:19.860
intrigues me that comes from
the country of Chile.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.890
It's a financial invention,
that overcomes framing

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.530
problems. Psychologically
salient --

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:35.410
it's an important invention,
and illustrates some of the

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.985
basic concepts.

00:58:36.985 --> 00:58:39.640
So let me talk about Chile.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.207
We're jumping around
the world here.

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:50.160
Chile had a problem with, like
many Latin American countries,

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.460
especially of that time,
with inflation.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:59:01.650
So, they had a currency called
the peso which inflated

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:03.170
enormously.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:05.910
It went up, I don't have the
numbers on it, but it went up,

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:07.990
you know like, prices went
up a thousand-fold.

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:14.200
And people were saying, we
can't trust anything.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.060
I wouldn't take a contract
paying pesos.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.760
The peso is gradually
becoming worthless.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.830
So, Chile switched to another
currency called

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:30.410
the escudo in 1960.

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.520
They said, OK, we're starting
fresh, we're not

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.650
going to have inflation.

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:34.890
And this is brand new.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:36.840
Now we're an escudo country.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.090
No inflation.

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:46.920
Then, in 1975, they switched
back to the peso.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.060
The exchange rate, peso to
escudo, was one escudo was

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.580
1,000 pesos.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.670
OK?

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:53.750
Because they'd had
something like a

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.950
1,000-fold price increase.

00:59:55.950 --> 01:00:00.230
And then, in 1975, the exchange
rate was one new peso

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.970
is 1,000 escudos.

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:05.890
So, a new peso was a
million old pesos.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.640
OK, this is getting
embarrassing.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.140
I mean like, can we trust
anything or anybody in Chile?

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.150
So, the invention
started in 1967.

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:19.980
People in Chile were saying,
we just want stability.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.040
You know, this is crazy,
our prices.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.750
If I owned one peso --

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:29.940
I have a nice 1,000 peso note
from 1955 and I pull it out in

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.500
1975 and it's worth nothing.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.840
It's not even worth the
paper it's printed on.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.390
So we've got to get
stability somehow.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:41.790
So, somebody in Chile had the
idea, all right, maybe we

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.830
can't protect, we don't know how
to protect the currency,

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:48.960
but we can create a unit
of account that

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.910
is stable in value.

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.980
And let's write contracts in
this unit of account rather

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.480
than pesos.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:01.400
So, in 1967, in Chile they
created something called the

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.690
Unidad de Fomento.

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:10.670
That's Spanish for Unit
of Development.

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:15.430
But what it was, was a
unit of account that

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.360
is indexed to inflation.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.110
And they said, write your
contracts in terms of --

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:24.840
and they called them
UFs, okay?

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:29.320
So, everything could
be written in UFs.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.530
Forget pesos, because you don't
trust pesos anymore.

01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:39.260
Let's write contracts in terms
of something else.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.510
And that stuck.

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:52.470
It started out as 100 escudos.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:02:10.730
I think it was one UF was 100
escudos in 1967, but, by 1977,

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:17.640
a UF was 450 new pesos.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.830
Now, if you want to know what a
UF is worth now, you just go

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:25.400
on the internet and it gives
it for every day.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.690
And the website is --

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:44.330
I think the website
is valoruf.cl, but

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:46.880
that's from my memory.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.500
And so, I looked up what a UF is
worth today, and it's, I'll

01:02:52.500 --> 01:03:00.820
use the dollar sign for
pesos, 21,468 pesos.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:07.720
So, that means that since 1977
prices have gone up about

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.240
50-fold in Chile.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.990
OK.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.790
But if you signed a contract
written in UFs, you're

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:19.310
completely protected
from that.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:24.945
And so, it's a very important
invention.

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.370
Why is it an important
invention?

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:33.300
It's important, because
without it

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.650
Chileans wouldn't index.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.350
We don't index much in the
United States, nothing, almost

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:41.250
nothing is indexed
to inflation.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:41.920
Why not?

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.430
I don't know.

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.510
It's like resistance to
wheeled suitcases.

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.660
You almost can't
figure it out.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.940
It's so obvious.

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.970
When you rent an
apartment, they

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:52.400
should index it to inflation.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.650
They should tell you, our
apartment rent goes up every

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:59.400
month, or down, depending
on the price level.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.080
When you advertise a house
for sale, it should

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.800
be indexed to inflation.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.700
Otherwise you're just
making it crazy.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.645
You're just making --

01:04:07.645 --> 01:04:10.432
Yale tuition should be
indexed to inflation.

01:04:10.432 --> 01:04:12.570
It should go up and down with
the level of inflation, that

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.980
keeps its real value constant.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.380
But we don't seem to do it,
because we can't --

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.460
something is blocking our
thinking about it.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.510
So, we have to do something
like this, I believe.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.710
And so, that's what
Chile has done.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:30.980
So, this is the way things
are done today in Chile.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.650
It became an invention
that took hold and

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:35.860
never left that country.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.860
If you rent an apartment in
Chile, good chance that your

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.120
rent will be quoted in UFs,
OK, and if you're paying a

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.720
monthly rent check, this
is what you do.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.970
So your rent is I don't
know how many UFs.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:57.090
You go to valoruf.cl, you find
out how many pesos it is, you

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.950
write out a check for that
number of pesos.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:01.130
OK?

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:05.560
And they do this out of habit.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.430
The amazing thing I discovered
is that in the United States,

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:11.660
and in just about every country
in the world except

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.430
Chile, alimony payments
are defined in

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.550
currency, all right?

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.020
You get a divorce.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.060
The mother, let's say, has
to support children.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.190
The father is required to pay
alimony for the next --

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.910
until the children grow
up, or indefinitely.

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:29.190
All right?

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.310
That's a long-term contract.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:31.850
What if there's inflation?

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:35.770
What does it do to the
value of the alimony?

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:39.540
Well, of course, the real
value goes down.

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:44.090
So, shouldn't courts just
index it to inflation.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.030
Well, they do in Chile.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:51.100
Because they've got a habit of
doing things in terms of UFs.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.520
So, this is an important
financial innovation.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.540
By the way, guess how much
consumer prices have gone up

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.380
in the United States since
we created a consumer

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:07.240
price index in 1913.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.630
It's 22-fold.

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:13.640
We've had a lot of inflation
in this country.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:19.940
22-fold.

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.870
Something that cost $1 in 1913
will cost $22 today.

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:28.010
That means, if you held cash
between 1913 and today,

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.480
basically you're completely
wiped out.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.340
But the inflation rate
is only 3% a year.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.940
That's 3% a year for
almost 100 years

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.520
is a 22-fold increase.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.180
So, we're living with this kind
of uncertainty in the

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.830
United States today.

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:52.000
We have not adopted the Chilean
invention of UFs.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.360
It's interesting that this
invention spread, somewhat,

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.290
throughout Latin America.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:00.620
And it stopped at
the Rio Grande.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.190
Mexico has something
called UDI.

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.000
Which is the Mexican version.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.970
It's U-D-I. Which is
the Mexican version

01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:10.110
of Unidad de Fomento.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.400
But the rest of the
world doesn't want

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.360
to copy this idea.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.490
Why is that?

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:19.920
I think it's partly because
this idea emerged out of

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.080
embarrassment.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.710
Chile had had massive
inflation which is

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:27.490
embarrassing, and nobody wants
to copy anything from someone

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:29.810
having that bad experience.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:32.960
It's also cultural, that
we're not used to

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.190
Latin American things.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:36.050
Just like we're not used
to using gimlets.

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:39.110
So, we don't have them.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.515
Let me just give one
more invention.

01:07:44.515 --> 01:07:45.630
It's important.

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.960
And then I'll stop.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.090
This is another financial
invention, more recently.

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:55.526
It's the invention
of the swap.

01:07:55.526 --> 01:07:59.390
I like to give this example,
because it relates to a couple

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:02.150
of our speakers.

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:05.130
What is a swap?

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:11.050
Well, the swap is a financial
contract that was invented by

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:19.110
none other than David Swensen,
who will be speaking soon.

01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:22.320
He is the Chief Investment
Officer for Yale University.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.920
He invented this before he
came to Yale, when he was

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.400
working for Salomon Brothers,
which was a major Wall Street

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.930
investment bank that
no longer exists.

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:36.890
But back then, in the early
80's, he apparently --

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.140
I've got a couple of sources.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.490
I think he is the real
inventor of it.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.690
What is a swap?

01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:48.600
It's a contact between two
parties, usually a fairly

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.250
long-term contract, to
exchange cash flows.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.600
So the simplest swap would
be a currency swap

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.230
where one country --

01:08:58.230 --> 01:09:00.930
There's two parties.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:03.370
Two different companies,
let's say.

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:09.050
One of them who promises to
exchange euros for dollars

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:12.380
every month for the next five
years, and the other one

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.640
promises to exchange dollars for
euros every month for the

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.330
next five years.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:22.180
It's a swap, but we decide in
advance on what the conversion

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:26.940
is, what the swap rate is,
between euros and dollars.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.730
So that's useful for risk
management purposes, because

01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:34.200
somebody, someone in Europe may
be getting dollars revenue

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200
in their business.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.130
They know they're going to get
this revenue over the next

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.720
five years.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.970
It's kind of a long-term
contract, long-term business

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:41.240
they're in.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.220
They might want to
go twenty years.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.680
But they don't know at what rate
they can convert it back

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.990
into euros.

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:51.270
And then, on the other side, we
have the Americans who may

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.400
be doing business in Europe, and
they get euro income and

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.070
they want to convert
it to dollars.

01:09:56.070 --> 01:10:04.060
So, they can make a contract
that swaps these cash flows.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.456
And that was the invention.

01:10:05.456 --> 01:10:07.960
And it didn't come
until the 1980's.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.900
It's amazing that these simple
ideas weren't out there.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.180
And why weren't they
out there?

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.180
Well, it may have something to
do with legal uncertainty,

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.570
regulatory uncertainty.

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:25.230
There's something called
ISDA which was

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:28.170
founded since the 1980's.

01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:31.720
That's the International Swaps
and Development Association.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.600
And what it does is, it lobbies
lawmakers for laws

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.540
that permit swaps to work
efficiently and effectively.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:46.120
And so, you need an organization
like ISDA that

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.720
will make these contracts work
as effectively as they are.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.660
Now swaps are a hugely
important contract.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:02.430
My last example, which is a
sub-example from this, is the

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:09.120
credit default swap, which is
something that I won't put

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.990
David Swensen's name.

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:22.360
The credit default
swap is a --

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.810
again a contract between two
parties that has to do with

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:30.610
the risk of a credit event.

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:33.780
So, there's a protection
buyer.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.860
There's two parties.

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.380
One we'll call the protection
buyer, and the other is a

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.470
protection seller.

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:45.370
And it would have
to do with --

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:51.910
basically the buyer promises to
pay the seller, at regular

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:58.480
intervals for some period of
time, and the money just flows

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.300
regularly from the buyer
to the seller,

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.830
until some event occurs.

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:05.250
We could say a bankruptcy
of some company.

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.000
It's defined in the contract.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.400
In which case, then, the
protection seller has to pay

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.650
the protection buyer.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.280
Now you might ask, isn't
this just like

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.770
an insurance contract?

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:19.580
Wouldn't you call
this insurance?

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:27.350
If I'm paying regular payments
to somebody else, and then, if

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:30.850
an event occurs, I'm getting
insurance against default by

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:32.140
some company.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.140
And I maybe doing business with
the company, or I may be

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.400
investing in the company's
bonds, so I may want this

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.250
protection.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.410
But it looks like insurance,
right?

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:44.300
Well actually, there's something
else called credit

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:52.915
insurance, which goes back to
the nineteenth century.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.620
There were companies in like
1880 that would allow you to

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.880
buy insurance against default,
or some failure of a company.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.710
So, this was an institution
and an invention of the

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:10.480
nineteenth century.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.750
But credit defaults
swaps are --

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.140
what's the difference?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:19.370
Well, the difference is, that
there is a whole culture and

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:21.860
regulatory environment developed
around credit

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:25.130
insurance that limited it.

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:26.710
They didn't have ISDA.

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:30.110
They had state insurance
regulators, OK, and they just

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.330
didn't have the same conceptual
framework.

01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:34.330
It's complicated.

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:39.780
The credit default swap was
boosted by ISDA and other

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.070
thinkers, who thought of
how to make this into

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:46.250
a huge, huge business.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:50.620
Credit insurance ended up being
kind of limited in its

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.140
application.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:58.000
And often the credit insurers
were more like consultants.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.420
They would say, we'll
insure your credit.

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.450
It will insure you against
the default by someone

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:06.100
you lend money to.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.980
But we want also to be involved
in helping you avoid

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.500
making bad contracts
like that.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.670
So, the credit default
swap became huge.

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.440
Let me just conclude
with this.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.786
This brings us back to one
of our outside speakers.

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:31.830
Hank Greenberg is going to talk
about his company AIG,

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:35.470
which failed because of errors
-- it didn't fail, it got

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.250
bailed out by the government.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.920
It got bailed out because
of errors made in

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.790
credit defaults swaps.

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:45.090
I don't think that these errors
were his fault, because

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:47.280
this happened after he
left the company.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.660
But I just want to mention this,
because it's all part of

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.590
a big picture.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:53.720
We had a financial invention,
the swap.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.270
Then we had the credit
default swap.

01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:59.160
And these are important
invention.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.460
They caused a leap forward
in our ability to do risk

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:02.960
management.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.210
But they created attendant
risks.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.560
They were new, and they weren't

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.030
understood well enough.

01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:11.250
And so, a big part of what
happened in this crisis was a

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:14.620
failure of the credit
default swap market.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.360
But that's not to me an
indictment of financial

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.240
innovation.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.090
I think the credit default
swap was an important

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:25.330
innovation, and we will see more
like it, and it will help

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.045
make for a better world.

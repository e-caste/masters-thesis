00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.700
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.065
In the one hundred years
between A.D.

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:10.399
98 and A.D.
 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.250
192, Rome had five emperors:
Trajan,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.110
Hadrian, Antonius Pius,
Marcus Aurelius and Commodus --

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.273
six if we count Lucius Verus,
who was co-emperor with Marcus

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:27.320
Aurelius for several years.
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.446
In the fifty years following
the death of the last of the

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:35.050
Severan emperors,
a young man by the name of

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.738
Alexander Severus,
who died in 235 A.D.,

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:42.640
Rome had twenty acknowledged
emperors,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.830
and many more pretenders to
imperial power.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.669
Rarely did anyone hold onto
power for more than a few years,

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:55.770
and some of them lasted only a
matter of months.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.395
I like to think of the emperors
as changing as quickly as the

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.170
seasons, in the third century
A.D.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.141
Any wrong move led to
assassination and replacement,

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:10.801
not by the Senate,
but by the provincial armies,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.060
by the provincial armies.
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.189
Civil wars were extremely
commonplace in the third century

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.046
A.D.,
and it was a very bad time for

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.787
the Roman emperors,
who could literally be stabbed

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:27.560
in the back at any moment;
and many of them were.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.150
The Roman frontiers were in
danger,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.742
the economy was in shambles,
and the vast bureaucracy was

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:39.500
also suffering significantly in
the third century A.D.,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.569
largely because of a lack of
central control.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.801
In view of this chaotic
situation, there was very little

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.614
time to build buildings,
which is obviously what's

00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:54.269
significant to us,
in the context of this course.

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:58.842
In many ways I think one can
describe, vis-Ã -vis

00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:02.060
architecture,
the third century A.D.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.120
as essentially a wasteland,
an architectural wasteland.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.330
There were no forums in the
third century A.D.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.560
There were no basilicas and
there were no baths.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.182
We will see that the major
project in the third century

00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:17.526
A.D.
 

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:21.122
was not unexpectedly,
given this situation,

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:23.520
a major defensive wall.
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.187
That was the main architectural
commission in the third century

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:30.388
A.D.,
and it's with that wall that I

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:33.360
want to begin today,
the so-called Aurelian Walls.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.752
Before I do,
I just want to give you a

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:39.633
glimpse of two of those twenty
acknowledged emperors who made

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:42.222
their way through the third
century A.D.:

00:02:42.222 --> 00:02:44.414
the boy emperor,
Gordian III,

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.650
on the left-hand side of the
screen,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.970
and the more mature emperor,
Pupienus,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.319
who was co-emperor with a man
by the name of Balbinus,

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.770
for a very short time.
 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.958
And, in fact,
just to give you a sense of the

00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.223
flavor of the third century,
both of them were dragged from

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.873
the palace,
not too long after they had

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:06.741
ascended to imperial power,
murdered and their bodies

00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:08.710
tossed in the Tiber River.
 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.530
If you look at these two
portraits,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.580
one of the boy emperor and one
of the more mature emperor,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.037
even though many,
many years separate them in

00:03:16.037 --> 00:03:18.456
chronological age,
I think you will see,

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:22.079
if you look at the way in which
these portraitists represented

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.550
their eyes,
in the likenesses of these two

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.293
individuals,
in these official portraits of

00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:29.825
Gordion and of Pupienus,
I think you'll see,

00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:32.959
if you look at those eyes,
that those eyes reveal the

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.330
concern that these emperors had
for the state of the Empire

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.699
during the third century A.D.:
a concern that was extremely

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.660
warranted, obviously.
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.647
So again I want to begin with
the only significant

00:03:47.647 --> 00:03:51.391
architectural project in the
third century A.D.

00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:56.520
in Rome, and that is this great
defensive wall system called the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.229
Aurelian Walls.
 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.272
The Aurelian Walls were built
for two main reasons:

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:04.335
one,
because the earlier walls,

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:07.229
the so-called Servian Walls,
which we studied at the very

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.921
beginning of the semester,
which date to the Republic--378

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:11.247
B.C.
 

00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:15.421
is when they were dedicated;
so way, way back in the

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.339
beginning of our discussion of
Roman architecture--

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.329
you'll remember that those
Servian Walls--

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:26.432
and I can show it to you with
this plan here of the walls

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.785
during ancient Roman times--
the Servian Walls encircled

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:33.180
just the Seven Hills of Rome.
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.339
So this central area here,
where we see the Palatine,

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:38.307
the Capitoline,
the Caelian,

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:42.476
the Quirinal Hill,
that was the location of that

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:44.569
original Servian Wall.
 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.240
As the city grew,
as the population grew,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.389
as more people were brought
back to Rome,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.877
through the various wars and
through the enslavement of large

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.557
numbers of people,
the city grew significantly in

00:04:57.557 --> 00:04:58.050
size.
 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.230
And so by this time,
by the third century,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.187
the Servian Wall was
essentially useless to protect

00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:07.795
Rome from those barbarians that
were literally at the gates at

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:10.399
this particular point in Roman
history,

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:14.300
so they needed to build that
wall to protect the city.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.021
But the other reason was
because of what was going on,

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:21.391
on the frontiers,
because Rome was more in danger

00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:23.709
than it had ever been before.
 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.500
Because of the kind of
political and economic situation

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.360
in Rome that I've just
described,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.867
there was a need for further
stability and the need to build

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:33.949
this second set of walls:
again,

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.310
the so-called Aurelian Walls.
 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.625
And this plan shows you how
much further out they went than

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.600
the Servian Walls,
all the way to the Tiber River.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.410
It didn't encompass the area
across the Tiber,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.180
where Hadrian's tomb,
Hadrian's mausoleum,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.612
the Castel Sant'Angelo is
located, but for the most part

00:05:50.612 --> 00:05:52.860
it did cover the main of the
city.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.050
And you can see,
it went far enough out that it

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.173
even encompassed some of the
major city roads,

00:05:59.173 --> 00:06:03.060
or the beginnings of some of
those major city roads.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.060
A view of the Aurelian Walls
itself,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.168
very well preserved,
here on the right-hand side of

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.600
the screen,
and a comparison of them with

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.240
the Servian Walls,
on the left.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.805
With regard to the Aurelian
Walls, they are named for the

00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:20.718
emperor Aurelian,
who was emperor of Rome between

00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.350
270 and 275 A.D.
 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.680
We believe that Aurelian began
the walls, either in 270 or 271.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.029
They were not finished by his
death in 275,

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.894
and they were completed by his
successor, a man by the name of

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:40.855
Probus, P-r-o-b-u-s;
Probus completed the Aurelian

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:46.529
Walls, and dedicated them right
after Aurelian's death,

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.000
in 275 A.D.
 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.670
The Aurelian Walls had a
twelve-mile circuit around the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.690
city of Rome.
 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.550
They were originally 25 and one
half feet tall,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.839
and there were eighteen major
gateways in the Aurelian Walls;

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.329
eighteen major gateways.
 

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:08.942
I think you can see from this
view on the right-hand side of

00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:13.399
the screen that the building
materials were concrete faced

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.060
with brick --
brick-faced concrete.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.329
You see that very clearly here.
 

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:21.238
And, of course,
it's important to keep in mind

00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:25.182
that that is different than what
the original Republican walls

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:26.540
were made out of.
 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.769
Those were made out of
cut-stone, ashlar blocks.

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:33.440
You see them here in this
section of the Servian Walls,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.985
that I show you once again,
blocks that are laid in the

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:39.350
scheme of headers and
stretchers,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.800
that we talked about at the
very beginning of the semester,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.310
when we discussed early Roman
wall building,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.490
both in Rome and in the early
colonies.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.035
And here again the Aurelian
Walls, with their up-to-date

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:54.350
concrete faced with brick.
 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.983
But it's a sign of the times
that scholars who have examined

00:07:57.983 --> 00:08:01.310
these bricks have determined
that they were not all new

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.720
bricks,
that many of them were re-used

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.372
bricks from earlier periods,
from the previous century in

00:08:08.372 --> 00:08:09.649
particular.
 

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:12.851
And the reason for that
probably has to do with the fact

00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.343
that again because there was so
little architectural activity

00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:19.836
during this period there was
simply no need to make bricks in

00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:22.420
large numbers,
and when they needed them for

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.821
this particular project,
they reached back and used some

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.410
that had been lying around of
earlier manufacture.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.496
So I think again that
underscores the incertitude of

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:37.788
this particular period of time.
 

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:41.048
Here's another very good view
of the Aurelian Walls,

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:43.539
as they look today,
brick-faced concrete

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.330
construction once again.
 

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.537
And what's impressive about the
Aurelian Walls is how much of

00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:51.009
them are preserved.
 

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.460
When I showed you the Servian
Walls,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.350
we could only look at bits and
pieces of those walls,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.320
preserved in different parts of
Rome,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.080
especially near the Rome train
station.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.178
But in the case of the Aurelian
Walls,

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:05.565
we have a very large extent of
those walls still preserved

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:08.056
today,
which is a tribute to how well

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:11.153
they were built,
that they have stood the test

00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:11.750
of time.
 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.017
And, in fact,
when one visits Rome,

00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:17.618
when you come into Rome from
Leonardo da Vinci Airport,

00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:21.620
the first things that you see
of the city are the walls.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.964
You go through those walls and
it announces to you,

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:29.379
of course, that you are in fact
about to enter the city of Rome.

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:33.629
I mentioned that the Aurelian
Walls had eighteen gateways.

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:36.291
Some of them are still
preserved, and I want to show

00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:38.794
you one of them here,
just to give you a sense of

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:40.570
what these gateways were like.
 

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.879
This is the so-called Porta
Appia.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:46.400
It also dates to the same time
as the walls,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.150
275 A.D.; called the Porta
Appia because it is at the exact

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.820
location of the Via Appia,
or the Appian Way in Rome.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.934
The gate--I'm going to show you
how the gate looked in the time,

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:07.080
in 275, and then how it was
altered somewhat later.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.553
You can see from the Monument
List that although it was built

00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:13.403
originally in 275,
it was restored by two

00:10:13.403 --> 00:10:17.710
Byzantine emperors by the name
of Honorius and Arcadius,

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.350
so this is in the post-Roman
period,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.897
and they did that in A.D.
 

00:10:23.897 --> 00:10:25.600
401 to 402.
 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.836
And the gate,
as you see it today,

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:31.566
extremely well preserved,
is the gate of the restoration

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:34.739
of the fifth century A.D.;
whereas this view,

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:37.018
this restored view from
Ward-Perkins,

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:40.500
shows you what the gate
would've looked like in 275.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.370
In 275 it had two arcuated
entranceways,

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.360
as you can see well here.
 

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.970
It had rounded towers,
rounded towers.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.065
It had small windows with
arcuations at the top,

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:56.899
as you can also see,
curvature at the top.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:59.890
And then Ward-Perkins
believes--there's some

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.576
controversy about this--but he
believes it was already

00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:06.360
crenulated in the third century
A.D.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.541
If you compare that to the gate
as restored by Honorius and

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:14.433
Arcadius, you can see that they
have removed one of the

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:15.658
entranceways.
 

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:19.517
There's a single arcuated
entranceway now in the center of

00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:22.768
the gate,
and they have also encased the

00:11:22.768 --> 00:11:26.019
rounded towers in these square
blocks,

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.139
as you can see here,
they've left the uppermost part

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:31.220
rounded but not the bottom part.
 

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.663
So they have changed it
somewhat, but I think it still

00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:37.436
gives you,
again, a very good sense of

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:40.232
what this gate,
and many of the other gates

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:43.870
that were part of this very
important defensive wall system,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.269
built in the third century,
looked like.

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:52.918
What we see happening toward
the end of the third century

00:11:52.918 --> 00:11:53.250
A.D.
 

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.820
is the return of a centralized,
of a strong,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.302
centralized government to Rome
and to the Roman Empire,

00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:04.788
after the bloody third century
A.D.

00:12:04.788 --> 00:12:08.690
and its numerous fly-by-night
emperors, as I call them here.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.419
And the vehicle of this return
of a stable government was the

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:16.808
foundation of what we call the
Tetrarchy;

00:12:16.808 --> 00:12:20.216
the Tetrarchy,
which means literally four-man

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:20.759
rule.
 

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:24.246
The Tetrarchy was the
brainchild of a man by the name

00:12:24.246 --> 00:12:25.320
of Diocletian.
 

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.288
Diocletian was a Dalmatian;
not a dog, but somebody who

00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:34.029
came from ancient Dalmatia,
now Croatia,

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:35.658
from Dalmatia.
 

00:12:35.658 --> 00:12:39.484
He was an imperial bodyguard
who rose to great heights and

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:41.899
eventually became emperor of
Rome.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:48.558
He began his own rise to power
in 283 A.D.; 283 A.D.

00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:52.246
But it was in 293,
after ten years into trying to

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:55.671
go it alone,
that he realized that the Roman

00:12:55.671 --> 00:13:00.287
Empire had become much too vast
for one man to be able to govern

00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:02.933
it alone,
and he came up with this

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:05.899
extraordinary idea to have
four-man rule.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:09.580
We've seen co-emperors before,
we've seen two-man rule--

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.937
there was two-man rule
initially with Marcus Aurelius

00:13:11.937 --> 00:13:14.969
and Lucius Versus,
for example--but we have never

00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:16.980
before seen a four-man rule.
 

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.221
But he felt that the Empire was
sprawling enough that it really

00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.778
needed emperors in four
different locations to enable

00:13:24.778 --> 00:13:29.500
the Empire to be governed and to
enable stability to be returned.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.664
And that was the concept of the
Tetrarchy, which again he

00:13:33.664 --> 00:13:34.928
founded in 293.
 

00:13:34.928 --> 00:13:38.961
By founding the Tetrarchy,
he made himself the main

00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:40.643
emperor,
the Augustus,

00:13:40.643 --> 00:13:43.879
but the Augustus in the eastern
part of the Empire,

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:48.764
and I'm sure he chose that
because of his own roots in

00:13:48.764 --> 00:13:51.740
Dalmatia,
in again what is now Croatia.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.195
He chose a man by the name of
Galerius to be his Caesar,

00:13:56.195 --> 00:14:00.567
to be his second-in-command,
in the eastern part of the

00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:01.460
Empire.
 

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.582
He selected Maximian,
Maximian to be Augustus in the

00:14:05.582 --> 00:14:08.841
West,
and then Constantius Chlorus to

00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:12.970
be the Caesar in the West:
Constantius Chlorus,

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.284
more well known as the father
of Constantine the Great than he

00:14:17.284 --> 00:14:19.533
is as a Tetrarch,
but he again,

00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:22.610
Constantius Chlorus,
was the designated Caesar in

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.379
the West.
 

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:28.190
Order was restored through the
vehicle of the Tetrarchy.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.788
And what that means for us,
in this course on Roman

00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:33.827
Architecture,
is that stability returned,

00:14:33.827 --> 00:14:38.408
stability that enabled major
architectural commissions to

00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:42.299
once again be done,
both in Rome and also around

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:44.974
the provinces,
and particularly in the

00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:48.620
provinces that these individuals
made their capitals,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.615
in a sense, and where they
lived, and where we'll see they

00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:54.440
built their own palaces.
 

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.308
So when we speak of tetrarchic
architecture,

00:14:58.308 --> 00:15:01.629
I think we have to keep in mind
that we are talking not just

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:04.735
about the renovation of Rome--
I mean, Rome itself,

00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:07.013
the renaissance,
let's call it that instead of

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:08.985
renovation;
the renaissance of Rome,

00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:12.649
Rome's rebirth under the
Tetrarchy and under Diocletian--

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:15.668
but we are also talking about
architecture,

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.296
as we'll see,
that was put up in the

00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:22.673
provinces,
also under the aegis of the

00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:24.620
Tetrarchs.
 

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.038
I want to just show you what
the Tetrarchs looked like,

00:15:28.038 --> 00:15:31.903
and their portraiture is also
illustrative of what their major

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:33.740
architectural agenda was.
 

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.217
We see a coin portrait on the
left-hand side of the screen of

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:39.577
Diocletian,
that gives his title,

00:15:39.577 --> 00:15:43.850
Augustus, as you can see here:
a typical Roman coin profile

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.827
portrait that shows him with a
closely cropped military

00:15:47.827 --> 00:15:49.668
hairstyle and beard.
 

00:15:49.668 --> 00:15:53.721
But the much more--and he is
represented this way in his

00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:57.182
coins, you know,
from 283, the first decade from

00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:58.730
283 to about 293.
 

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.215
But the image that becomes the
image of the Tetrarchs as a

00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:05.090
whole is the sort of thing that
you see here.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.631
We begin to see,
with the formation of the

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.610
Tetrarchy, representations of
them as a group.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.769
It's sort of a one for all and
all for one concept,

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:18.480
that they are shown in mutual
support,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.399
holding each other,
in fact embracing each other,

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:25.500
in mutual support as they try
to re-stabilize the government.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.870
This is a wonderful group
portrait of the four Tetrarchs.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.350
It's done in this
reddish-purplish stone that

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.379
comes from Egypt called
porphyry,

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:38.126
p-o-r-p-h-y-r-y,
and a stone that we'll see used

00:16:38.126 --> 00:16:40.440
extensively in this period.
 

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.668
This portrait is carved out of
that.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.375
We don't--we have thoughts
about where it might have come

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:48.759
from, perhaps even
Constantinople.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:52.450
But it ended up in Venice,
and any of you who make your

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.293
way to San Marco in Venice--
it's not immediately obvious

00:16:56.293 --> 00:16:58.658
where it is,
but if you stand in front of

00:16:58.658 --> 00:17:00.754
San Marco,
facing it, and go off a bit to

00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:03.809
the right,
you will see this incredible

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:08.403
porphyry group,
hugging one corner of the

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.880
building over here.
 

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.609
And again you can see
them--it's done--what's

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.588
interesting to us,
I think, is the fact that it's

00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:19.319
done in a very geometric
abstract style.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.808
It doesn't look realistic.
 

00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:26.228
They are done--their
proportions are stumpy and their

00:17:26.228 --> 00:17:29.391
bodies,
their military costumes and

00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:32.220
their faces seem almost more
like--

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.910
and the hats that they wear,
these Pannonian caps--

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.549
seem almost more like geometric
shapes than they seem like real

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:39.960
clothing and the like.
 

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.448
And that is part and parcel of
a certain aesthetic that we see

00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:46.707
developing, this interest in
geometric and abstract forms,

00:17:46.707 --> 00:17:48.480
that we see in portraiture.
 

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.829
But we also see,
which is important for us

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:53.238
today, we see that in
architecture as well,

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.269
that interest.
 

00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:57.240
And I think--and perhaps it's
going too far,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.673
but I don't think so--I think
that the taste for that

00:18:00.673 --> 00:18:04.240
particular formulation has to do
in part with this,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.548
the fact that they believe they
have returned,

00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:09.180
or they're trying to return
stability to the government,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.038
so they choose these very
solid, geometric,

00:18:12.038 --> 00:18:15.480
abstract forms to represent
their images --

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.660
be they portraiture or be they,
as we'll see,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.150
monumental works of
architecture.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.592
Perhaps it's not surprising to
see that when Diocletian begins

00:18:25.592 --> 00:18:28.868
to put up monumental
architecture in Rome,

00:18:28.868 --> 00:18:31.846
he chooses first public
monuments, public monuments that

00:18:31.846 --> 00:18:34.823
are going to be seen and that
are going to speak to this

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.798
return of stability to Rome,
and he chooses to put them in

00:18:38.798 --> 00:18:41.588
as visible place as he possibly
can.

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:45.210
And what's the most visible
place in the city of Rome but

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.990
the Roman Forum,
the great Forum Romanum.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.314
So we see Diocletian
commissioning a monument to put

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:54.348
up in the Roman Forum.
 

00:18:54.348 --> 00:18:58.358
That monument is referred to by
a variety of names.

00:18:58.358 --> 00:19:01.933
We usually call it--and I've
indicated this for you on the

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.099
Monument List--
we usually call it,

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:07.230
the preferred name for it is
the Decennial Monument,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.608
the Decennial Monument.
 

00:19:08.608 --> 00:19:11.892
But it is also sometimes called
the Five Column Monument,

00:19:11.892 --> 00:19:15.000
and it is sometimes called the
Tetrarchic Monument.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.707
It's called the Tetrarchic
Monument because it honors the

00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:18.528
four Tetrarchs.
 

00:19:18.528 --> 00:19:21.373
It's called the Five Column
Monument because it's made up,

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:22.970
as we'll see,
of five columns.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.263
And it's called the Decennial
Monument because it honors the

00:19:28.263 --> 00:19:32.032
decennalia,
the ten-year rule of the

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:35.626
Tetrarchy;
the Tetrarchy founded in 293,

00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:39.900
the monument is put up in 303,
so ten years of rule.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.720
And it also honored the
twentieth anniversary,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.900
the vicennalia,
v-i-c-e-n-n-a-l-i-a,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.940
the vicennalia,
of Diocletian,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.450
because Diocletian had become
emperor in 283.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.919
So he's lasted twenty
years--which is extraordinary

00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:57.833
considering some emperors of the
third century only lasted a

00:19:57.833 --> 00:20:00.739
matter of months--
he's lasted twenty years,

00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:03.650
and his Tetrarchy has lasted
ten years.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.288
And it's time for a
celebration, and he puts up a

00:20:07.288 --> 00:20:10.019
major monument in the Roman
Forum.

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:14.220
Let me show you via this map
first, this plan of the Roman

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.346
Forum as it would've looked
between the third century and

00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:20.410
the seventh century A.D.
 

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.255
We see a number of buildings
that we have looked at together

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:23.690
before.
 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.632
We can see in the uppermost
part the Tabularium,

00:20:26.632 --> 00:20:28.259
the Temple of Vespasian.
 

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:32.848
We see the Arch of Septimius
Severus up here.

00:20:32.848 --> 00:20:35.519
We see some buildings we did
not talk about;

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.726
for example,
the Temple of the Divine Julius

00:20:37.726 --> 00:20:40.019
Caesar,
and a couple of basilicas that

00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:42.750
were put here in the late
Republic and into--

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.548
and finished in the Augustan
period.

00:20:45.548 --> 00:20:48.958
The two buildings that we're
going to look at today are the

00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.838
Senate House,
or the Curia Julia,

00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:54.130
but also at the Rostra,
or what's behind the Rostra.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.088
You see the Rostra there,
right in the center;

00:20:56.088 --> 00:21:00.038
that's the dais from which
major speeches were made.

00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:03.460
If you look right behind the
Rostra, you will see four

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.557
columns on a curve,
and then another column right

00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:07.588
behind them.
 

00:21:07.588 --> 00:21:12.678
That is the so-called Five
Column Monument,

00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:16.916
of the Tetrarchy,
that we see there,

00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:20.308
right behind the Rostra.
 

00:21:20.308 --> 00:21:22.548
Now here we're looking at a
Google Earth image,

00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:26.222
from the same vantage point,
that shows us again the

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:28.939
Colosseum,
the Victor Emmanuel Monument,

00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:31.422
the Capitoline Hill,
the Palatine Hill,

00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:32.680
the Circus Maximus.
 

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.259
Here the Forum in the center.
 

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:41.759
And we can locate the Five
Column Monument by--

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:44.548
let me see, here we have the
Curia,

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:46.769
here we have the Arch of
Septimius Severus,

00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:51.298
and then right next to the Arch
of Septimius Severus,

00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:54.651
essentially to the left of it,
was the location of the Five

00:21:54.651 --> 00:21:58.460
Column Monument,
right behind the Rostra.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.270
Now the problem is that all we
have left of this so-called Five

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.538
Column Monument is a single
base, one base of one of the

00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:08.470
columns.
 

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.548
And you can see that base on
display,

00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:15.440
right in front of,
on a base, right--

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.618
on a base, on a different base
made out of brick,

00:22:20.618 --> 00:22:23.288
as you see here--the base of
that one column,

00:22:23.288 --> 00:22:26.288
right in front of the Arch of
Septimius Severus,

00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:28.568
dwarfed by the Arch of
Septimius Severus.

00:22:28.568 --> 00:22:31.892
In fact, I'm always on the
lookout when I'm in that part of

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:35.098
the Forum to see if anybody
looks at the column base,

00:22:35.098 --> 00:22:38.433
and nobody ever does,
they're so taken both with the

00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:41.759
Arch of Septimius Severus,
with the Baroque church that

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:44.820
lies behind and with the Curia
or Senate House that we're all

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.621
going to look at today,
that they don't happen to

00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.359
notice this.
 

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:50.269
But that is all that survives.
 

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:52.930
So you might ask yourself,
well then how in the world do

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.930
we know there was a five column
monument behind the Rostra,

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.298
and that this is one of those
columns?

00:22:57.298 --> 00:23:01.356
Because we have a depiction of
it on the Arch of Constantine,

00:23:01.356 --> 00:23:04.468
which we'll be looking at on
Tuesday, the early

00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:05.752
fourth-century A.D.
 

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:06.430
arch.
 

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.598
One of the scenes that shows
Constantine himself,

00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:12.769
is located in the Roman Forum,
and we see Constantine,

00:23:12.769 --> 00:23:15.571
now headless,
with some of his attendants and

00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:18.654
other individuals,
standing on the Rostra,

00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:21.160
making an address to the
people.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.068
He's surrounded--this is very
interesting,

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.931
we'll talk about why next
time--surrounded by seated

00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:28.400
portraits of Hadrian and Marcus
Aurelius,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.232
identifiable by their
portraits, and he's making an

00:23:31.232 --> 00:23:31.798
address.
 

00:23:31.798 --> 00:23:35.407
And if you look very carefully
you will see behind him are five

00:23:35.407 --> 00:23:38.663
columns;
five columns that have statues

00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:40.088
on top of them.
 

00:23:40.088 --> 00:23:43.577
That is the Five Column
Monument that stood behind the

00:23:43.577 --> 00:23:44.170
Rostra.
 

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.653
So that, combined with that
preserved base,

00:23:46.653 --> 00:23:50.083
gives us a very good sense of
what that monument might have

00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:51.029
looked like.
 

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:52.615
Now you may be asking yourself,
"What is she talking

00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:53.240
about, five columns?
 

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.630
There are only four Tetrarchs.
 

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.150
Is she misspeaking here?"
 

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.509
No, I'm speaking correctly,
there were five columns,

00:23:58.509 --> 00:24:02.588
but one of those columns was
put up to Jupiter,

00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:06.167
Jupiter: the head god,
Jupiter who was the patron god

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:07.269
of Diocletian.
 

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:10.980
So we see Jupiter in one column
on his own,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.817
back behind the others,
and then the other four columns

00:24:14.817 --> 00:24:18.150
of the Tetrarchs,
each with a base with

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.970
sculptural figural decoration
down below.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.781
The shaft was plain,
and then a statue of each of

00:24:25.781 --> 00:24:30.230
the four Tetrarchs and a statue
of Jupiter on the top.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.930
And we think that the column
and statue of Jupiter were

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.739
probably a little bit taller,
as is indicated here,

00:24:35.739 --> 00:24:39.380
because he was after all a god,
than the others.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.519
And you can see the way it is
located behind the Rostra,

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.720
so that again if someone were
speaking from the Rostra,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.740
this is exactly what you'd be
seeing behind,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.858
just as we see in the Arch of
Constantine.

00:24:51.858 --> 00:24:54.970
You also see its location,
as it faces the Temple of

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.630
Divine Julius Caesar--which is
probably not a coincidence;

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.140
we do see that Diocletian tried
to link himself to Caesar and

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.241
others, great leaders of the
Roman past--and then this

00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:07.288
basilica completed by Augustus.
 

00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:11.528
This was a very carefully
chosen location by Diocletian,

00:25:11.528 --> 00:25:14.461
to link himself,
after this bloody third

00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:16.442
century,
as I mentioned,

00:25:16.442 --> 00:25:20.900
to link himself with the great
leaders of the Roman past.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.230
I want to show you quickly,
because this is again,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.078
of course, in architecture and
not in sculpture,

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:28.598
but I do want to show you just
quickly the scenes on the base.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:32.737
Because I think one of the
interesting detective work one

00:25:32.737 --> 00:25:36.567
can do is to try to figure out,
since we have only one base,

00:25:36.567 --> 00:25:38.977
whose base was it,
which of the four Tetrarchs,

00:25:38.977 --> 00:25:40.338
or was it Jupiter's base?
 

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:43.215
And I've played that game
myself, and I'll give you my

00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:46.690
idea, and you'll see whether you
think it's a good one or not.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.507
We look at the scene at the top
uppermost part Ã¢â¬â

00:25:49.507 --> 00:25:52.588
we're looking at the four sides
of that sculptured base.

00:25:52.588 --> 00:25:56.338
At the top you see two
victories, with a shield,

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:58.640
and that shield has the word in
the center,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.830
decennalia,
decennalia:

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.815
that's how we know it's
dedicated to the decennial

00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:06.838
anniversary,
ten-year rule, of the Tetrarchs.

00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:10.900
You can also see barbarians
down below, so a reference to

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.220
those who have been conquered.
 

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.715
And if you look very carefully,
you'll see that the figures are

00:26:16.715 --> 00:26:20.156
outlined in the way that we saw
them at Orange and also at St.

00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:21.058
RÃ©my.
 

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:24.775
And then some of the items,
including the arms and armor,

00:26:24.775 --> 00:26:27.693
are actually inscribed,
carved, on the stone,

00:26:27.693 --> 00:26:29.420
directly on the stone.
 

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.680
So this very interesting use of
outlining here.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.328
Here I don't think the reason
for it is the same.

00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:37.123
I don't think they're looking
at copy books,

00:26:37.123 --> 00:26:40.826
but rather that there has
been--there's now an interest in

00:26:40.826 --> 00:26:43.750
this kind of outlining for
visual effect.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.568
Up here we see a sacrifice of
three animals being brought in

00:26:47.568 --> 00:26:50.086
for sacrifice,
and the men with their axes who

00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:52.190
are going to slit their throats
ultimately --

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.375
the sacrifice obviously in
honor of this decennial

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:58.480
celebration,
this anniversary celebration,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.298
making reference to ten-year
rule of the Tetrarchy.

00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:04.378
Here's a scene down
here--unfortunately,

00:27:04.378 --> 00:27:07.471
in all of these scenes where we
seem to have the emperor or

00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:10.028
emperors, the heads are no
longer preserved.

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:13.438
So here we have a sacrifice
scene, also a sacrifice being

00:27:13.438 --> 00:27:16.298
made in honor of this decennial
anniversary,

00:27:16.298 --> 00:27:18.278
but the emperor,
represented here,

00:27:18.278 --> 00:27:21.571
who was sacrificing,
whose base this probably was,

00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.759
his face is gone.
 

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:25.318
But you can see he's
accompanied by Roma,

00:27:25.318 --> 00:27:28.776
by the Senate,
the personification of the

00:27:28.776 --> 00:27:31.228
Senate,
by Mars, by Victory,

00:27:31.228 --> 00:27:34.740
who crowns him with a wreath,
as you can see here.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.063
And this looks like a figure of
Sol Helios, with the rayed

00:27:38.063 --> 00:27:38.529
crown.
 

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:41.540
So a whole panoply of
divinities by whom he is being

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.730
honored and with whom he wants
to associate himself.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.454
This is the most important
relief, I believe,

00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:51.420
in terms of speculating about
whose base this might have been.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.202
We see four figures,
four adult males,

00:27:54.202 --> 00:27:57.288
in the foreground,
with togas, all of them

00:27:57.288 --> 00:27:59.318
headless unfortunately.
 

00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:02.968
But four of them--that's no
coincidence, all four standing

00:28:02.968 --> 00:28:03.480
there.
 

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.990
So while we see one of
them--this is his base--one of

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.913
them sacrificing here;
I guess one could argue it's

00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:12.750
Diocletian as the head of the
Tetrarchy, that would be another

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.450
possibility.
 

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.259
But the four of them
represented here.

00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:18.374
But if you look very closely,
one of them is accompanied by a

00:28:18.374 --> 00:28:18.788
child.
 

00:28:18.788 --> 00:28:22.550
So my speculation would be
since one of them is accompanied

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.182
by a child,
and since it is Constantine who

00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:31.278
was thought most likely to be
the one to eventually succeed

00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:34.273
the Tetrarchs,
or become a Tetrarch himself,

00:28:34.273 --> 00:28:36.356
I would speculate--
and this is pure

00:28:36.356 --> 00:28:40.439
speculation--that this may have
been the base of Constantius

00:28:40.439 --> 00:28:43.746
Chlorus,
of his father Constantius

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:48.598
Chlorus, and that the clue there
is Constantine.

00:28:48.598 --> 00:28:52.358
Another building that
Diocletian was interested in,

00:28:52.358 --> 00:28:54.928
in the Roman Forum,
in terms of associating himself

00:28:54.928 --> 00:28:56.880
with Caesar and also with
Augustus,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.670
was the Senate House.
 

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.769
The Curia Julia it is called,
the Curia Julia:

00:29:01.769 --> 00:29:05.353
because it was actually not
built in the Diocletianic

00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:08.445
period,
but built initially--begun by

00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:10.692
Caesar,
begun by Julius Caesar to

00:29:10.692 --> 00:29:14.088
provide Rome with a Senate House
in the Roman Forum --

00:29:14.088 --> 00:29:18.349
begun by Caesar and completed
by Augustus after Caesar's

00:29:18.349 --> 00:29:18.970
death.
 

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.058
But the building was--and
that's why it's named Curia

00:29:23.058 --> 00:29:26.361
Julia after the Julian family,
that Caesar,

00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:29.348
and also Augustus,
were a part of.

00:29:29.348 --> 00:29:31.938
But that building,
the Curia Julia,

00:29:31.938 --> 00:29:34.906
was destroyed,
very seriously destroyed,

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:37.420
in a fire in Rome in 283 A.D.
 

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.970
And so what Diocletian does is
he restores it between 284--

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.232
he begins already in 284,
well before the formation of

00:29:45.232 --> 00:29:48.686
the Tetrarchy,
and he completes it in 305

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.910
A.D.; this restoration.
 

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.318
It continues to be called the
Curia Julia,

00:29:53.318 --> 00:29:56.548
but it is at this point a
Diocletianic building,

00:29:56.548 --> 00:30:01.692
but one that clearly--where he
instructed his designers to try

00:30:01.692 --> 00:30:05.910
to keep it as close to the
original as possible.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:09.481
Now what you're looking at here
on the right-hand side of the

00:30:09.481 --> 00:30:12.875
screen is a coin that comes from
the period of the emperor

00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:15.153
Augustus,
and it purports to represent--I

00:30:15.153 --> 00:30:17.670
don't think there's any question
that it represents,

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.940
given its inscription and so
on--the Senate House in Rome,

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.858
as it would have looked as
completed by Augustus,

00:30:24.858 --> 00:30:27.788
and he's in fact celebrating
the completion of this monument,

00:30:27.788 --> 00:30:30.500
and associating himself,
through this coin,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.440
with his divine adoptive
father, Julius Caesar.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.016
If we look at the form--if we
look at the exterior of this

00:30:37.016 --> 00:30:39.631
monument,
as it is depicted on the coin,

00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:42.298
you will see that it is a
regular square,

00:30:42.298 --> 00:30:45.390
the front of the building looks
like a square,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.210
with a very large pediment at
the top,

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.420
although I think that was
accentuated here,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.088
its size, in order to allow the
die cutter to include the

00:30:54.088 --> 00:30:56.970
sculpture in the pediment,
and also the sculpture

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:57.950
decorating the eaves.
 

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.298
We see the doorway right here.
 

00:31:00.298 --> 00:31:02.483
We see there seems to be a
triple window,

00:31:02.483 --> 00:31:03.740
up above the doorway.
 

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.094
And if you look very carefully
you will see that there seems to

00:31:07.094 --> 00:31:09.222
be a portico,
a series of columns,

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:12.885
that are there to relive the
severity of the otherwise very

00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:15.348
geometrically ordered
faÃ§ade.

00:31:15.348 --> 00:31:19.875
So that's what we think it
looked like in the time of

00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:22.400
Caesar, based on that coin.
 

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.558
You see it over here in plan.
 

00:31:24.558 --> 00:31:28.880
This is a plan of the forum in
Rome, in the Augustan period,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.538
10 A.D.
 

00:31:29.538 --> 00:31:32.192
We see the buildings that were
there at that time:

00:31:32.192 --> 00:31:34.378
the basilicas;
the Temple of Divine Julius

00:31:34.378 --> 00:31:35.849
Caesar;
the Rostra, but of course

00:31:35.849 --> 00:31:37.319
without the Five Column
Monument;

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.700
no Arch of Septimius Severus.
 

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.558
But we do see the Curia.
 

00:31:40.558 --> 00:31:43.596
And you see it here in plan as
a very plain,

00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:46.140
open, rectangular box,
in a sense.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.702
So even in its Caesarian and
Augustan beginnings,

00:31:49.702 --> 00:31:52.969
it seems to have been a very
straightforward,

00:31:52.969 --> 00:31:55.788
matter-of-fact kind of a
building.

00:31:55.788 --> 00:32:00.030
This is a restored view of what
we believe it looked like after

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.220
the restoration by Diocletian.
 

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.038
You won't be surprised to hear
that the materials were

00:32:05.038 --> 00:32:07.144
different,
that it's a building--in its

00:32:07.144 --> 00:32:10.380
restored version it was made out
of concrete faced with brick,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.298
exposed brick.
 

00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:14.430
So very much a building of its
own time.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.894
It would not have looked like
that in the time of Caesar and

00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:18.538
Augustus.
 

00:32:18.538 --> 00:32:20.730
But they have,
in every other way,

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.519
they have kept to the
underlying geometry of the form,

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:28.950
to the use of the triple window
with a curved top,

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.900
as you can see here an arcuated
top,

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.750
a pediment up above.
 

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.789
We don't know whether the
second version had pedimental

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:38.549
sculpture in it,
or other decorative sculpture.

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:39.690
The doorway down below.
 

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.200
But the severity of the
brick-faced,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.105
the exposed brick faÃ§ade
has been alleviated somewhat by

00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:49.508
the placement of marble
revetment at the bottom part of

00:32:49.508 --> 00:32:53.618
the wall,
behind a series of columns.

00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:56.279
So they have kept that portico,
that set of columns,

00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:59.424
to relive the severity,
but also to make this building

00:32:59.424 --> 00:33:01.630
look,
as much as they could,

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.720
like the original Caesarian and
Augustan structure.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.130
This is what the Curia looks
like today.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.150
It is extremely well preserved,
as you can see.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:16.570
Yes, it's lacking its marble
revetment, and it's lacking its

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.490
portico.
 

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.680
But in every other way you can
see very well exactly what this

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.839
building looked like in the time
of Diocletian:

00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:28.877
concrete faced with brick,
with the very simple windows,

00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:33.798
and this very geometric,
abstract ordering.

00:33:33.798 --> 00:33:36.542
Which again I believe--you
know, I think the explanation

00:33:36.542 --> 00:33:37.940
for that is twofold:
one,

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.085
that they are trying to
maintain the look of the

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:44.769
original Julian building,
but also because this is again

00:33:44.769 --> 00:33:48.689
the aesthetic of the time,
this decision to make buildings

00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:52.068
in a very geometrically ordered,
abstract way;

00:33:52.068 --> 00:33:56.444
I believe again to reflect the
stability of their new

00:33:56.444 --> 00:33:57.538
government.
 

00:33:57.538 --> 00:34:00.316
This building,
the Curia Julia,

00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:05.130
owes its excellent condition to
the fact that it,

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.240
like so many buildings we've
talked about this semester,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.059
was reused over time.
 

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:13.452
We know that it was turned into
a church already in the seventh

00:34:13.452 --> 00:34:16.284
century B.C.;
that it was restored in the

00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:20.322
twelfth and in the sixteen
century A.D.--did I say seventh

00:34:20.322 --> 00:34:21.670
century B.C.?
 

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.900
If I did, I meant A.D.;
seventh century A.D.;

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.670
twelfth and sixteenth
centuries, and then again in the

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.820
seventeenth century.
 

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.599
And it was in the seventeenth
century that it,

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:32.340
like so many other Roman
structures,

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.652
was transformed into a Baroque
church by an architect by the

00:34:36.652 --> 00:34:39.429
name of Martino Longhi the
Younger--

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.380
I've put his name on the
Monument List for you,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.313
Martino Longhi the Younger--and
it was re-consecrated as

00:34:46.313 --> 00:34:48.760
San'Adriano,
Saint Hadrian,

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.300
al Foro Romano,
San'Adriano al Foro Romano,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.960
Saint Hadrian in the Roman
Forum was the church.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.389
And when I say Baroque church,
I mean a Baroque church.

00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:02.628
It was deconsecrated by
Mussolini in the 1930s,

00:35:02.628 --> 00:35:06.217
Mussolini returning it to its
original ancient form,

00:35:06.217 --> 00:35:08.260
as you can see over here.
 

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.896
But this photograph shows the
work that was being done in the

00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:17.610
'30s to dismantle this Baroque
church into which the Curia had

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.460
become.
 

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.155
I mean, it's really hard to
believe that this was the Curia

00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:23.525
in the seventeenth century,
but that's exactly what it

00:35:23.525 --> 00:35:24.822
looked like,
as well as in the early

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:25.460
twentieth century.
 

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.376
And you can see a bell-tower
had been added,

00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:31.226
buttresses had been added to
the structure,

00:35:31.226 --> 00:35:34.889
completely encasing the Curia
in a Baroque church.

00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:38.581
And we see that being
dismantled in this view over

00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:39.110
here.
 

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.280
And I have a view I can show
you also of the interior.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.659
This was the interior in the
seventeenth century;

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:49.574
impossible to see that original
simple box-like interior that

00:35:49.574 --> 00:35:52.768
was there in the time of
Diocletian,

00:35:52.768 --> 00:35:54.820
and probably there in the time
of Caesar and Augustus,

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.063
so filled is it with the usual
Baroque paraphernalia of

00:35:59.063 --> 00:36:04.250
elaborate stucco work and angels
flying to the skies and these--

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.065
not that we haven't seen this
kind of thing in Roman

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:08.989
architecture,
we of course have.

00:36:08.989 --> 00:36:11.771
But you can see that the
original shape of this

00:36:11.771 --> 00:36:15.338
particular building has been
completely disguised by Martino

00:36:15.338 --> 00:36:19.329
Longhi the Younger as he redoes
the Curia as a Baroque church.

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:22.836
This is--when they took all of
that Baroque accretion off,

00:36:22.836 --> 00:36:24.929
this is what they ended up
with.

00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:26.719
This is what the Curia looked
like--

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:29.681
probably very similar to this
in the time of Caesar and

00:36:29.681 --> 00:36:31.293
Augustus--
what it looked like under

00:36:31.293 --> 00:36:33.166
Diocletian,
and what it again looks like

00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:33.510
today.
 

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.751
You can see from this view this
very simple, box-like shape for

00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:42.639
the interior of this structure:
plain walls;

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:45.289
a coffered, a flat coffered
ceiling;

00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:49.802
the only light brought in by a
series of very simple windows,

00:36:49.802 --> 00:36:53.789
with arcuated tops,
allowing light into the system.

00:36:53.789 --> 00:36:56.010
And then down below--again the
brick facing,

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.150
the concrete and brick facing
exposed--

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.182
but with the down below
probably some marble revetment

00:37:02.182 --> 00:37:04.010
on the wall down here.
 

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.364
Very simple niches,
arcuated and rectangular

00:37:06.364 --> 00:37:08.389
niches, but very,
very simple ones.

00:37:08.389 --> 00:37:10.679
And then here you see the
benches,

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:13.623
the stone benches,
on which the senators would

00:37:13.623 --> 00:37:16.239
have sat when they were
deliberating--

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:18.547
or stood in front of,
because they got up a lot and

00:37:18.547 --> 00:37:21.050
orated--
but stood in front of when they

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.289
delivered their speeches,
or sat.

00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:28.067
And then down below the
original marble revetted floor

00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:29.960
is still preserved.
 

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.329
And I can show you two views
here, in color,

00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:35.710
of that floor,
to give you a sense--

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.807
all done in marbles,
marbles brought from different

00:37:38.807 --> 00:37:40.110
parts of the world.
 

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.925
But the usual colors that the
Romans liked for most of their

00:37:42.925 --> 00:37:46.117
marble pavements,
a white or off-white,

00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:50.831
maroon, green and black,
but very nicely done for

00:37:50.831 --> 00:37:54.199
this--very simple,
very geometrically ordered,

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:56.079
but very beautiful interior.
 

00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:58.730
With regard to public
architecture,

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:02.460
Diocletian also built a major
bath in Rome,

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.039
following the lead of Caracalla
and many emperors before him,

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:09.858
to provide for the Roman people
a place where they could go and

00:38:09.858 --> 00:38:12.518
enjoy themselves,
as well as learn.

00:38:12.518 --> 00:38:16.195
Because you'll remember that by
this time these major imperial

00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:18.456
bath structures--
and this is one of

00:38:18.456 --> 00:38:22.429
those--placed the bathing block
inside a much larger precinct,

00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:27.012
that included rooms around it
that served as lecture halls and

00:38:27.012 --> 00:38:31.596
meeting halls and seminar rooms
and places for Greek and Latin

00:38:31.596 --> 00:38:35.693
libraries and the like,
and we see that same scheme

00:38:35.693 --> 00:38:36.949
being used here.
 

00:38:36.949 --> 00:38:40.581
The baths were built between
A.D.

00:38:40.581 --> 00:38:44.670
298 and 306 by Diocletian in
Rome.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.630
They're located near the train
station today;

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.465
so very close to those
remaining fragments of the

00:38:50.465 --> 00:38:51.409
Servian Walls.
 

00:38:51.409 --> 00:38:53.889
And you see again that plan
here.

00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:57.971
And you see that the outer
precinct has one of these large

00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:01.909
hemicycles that may have been
used for performances,

00:39:01.909 --> 00:39:05.063
as you can see,
and that it is like the other

00:39:05.063 --> 00:39:07.860
imperial baths that we've looked
at,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.869
with the central bathing rooms
in the center,

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:13.369
in axial relationship to one
another,

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:16.617
and in the usual sequence,
and then with other rooms

00:39:16.617 --> 00:39:19.099
disposed around them on either
side,

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:20.550
in a symmetrical way.
 

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.309
We see at Number 4 the
natatio or swimming pool.

00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:27.148
We see--which has a scalloped,
the bottom side,

00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:29.121
as you see it here,
is scalloped,

00:39:29.121 --> 00:39:30.110
the wall is.
 

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.505
Number 3 is the
frigidarium,

00:39:32.505 --> 00:39:36.099
the cold room of the baths,
which had a triple groin

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:37.510
vaulted ceiling.
 

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.800
From there we go into the
tepidarium;

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.501
you see it here,
a small circular structure with

00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:46.030
radiating arms that give it a
cross shape.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.170
And then down below a very
interesting caldarium,

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.226
because we see that Diocletian
and his architects have rejected

00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:56.637
the round caldarium,
with the radiating alcoves,

00:39:56.637 --> 00:39:58.570
looking so much like the
Pantheon,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.650
as we discussed,
and almost as large,

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.590
from the Baths of Caracalla.
 

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.920
They've rejected that in favor
of a more rectangular shape,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.079
that's more similar to the
shape of the frigidarium,

00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:14.056
but with radiating apses that
have a series of columns that

00:40:14.056 --> 00:40:18.090
allow views and vistas from one
to the other.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.317
This is another version of the
same plan, from Ward-Perkins in

00:40:21.317 --> 00:40:24.280
this particular case that shows
again the natatio,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.710
the frigidarium.
 

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.380
Here you can see better the way
in which the circle becomes a

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.159
cross shape for the
tepidarium;

00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:33.079
and then here the
caldarium below,

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:35.050
where you can also see better,
I believe,

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.800
the columns on those alcoves
that allow views,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.119
both from inside out and
outside in.

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.268
And here still another one.
 

00:40:46.268 --> 00:40:49.047
This is the one that you have
on your Monument List that shows

00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:50.961
you those spaces,
once again from the other

00:40:50.961 --> 00:40:51.599
direction.
 

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.726
The natatio,
where you can see very well the

00:40:53.726 --> 00:40:55.596
scalloped wall;
the frigidarium,

00:40:55.596 --> 00:40:57.690
where you can see the
triple-groin vault;

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.360
the tepidarium with its
round shape and radiating arms;

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.708
and then most importantly the
caldarium with probably

00:41:04.708 --> 00:41:06.923
also triple groin vaulted,
just like the

00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:09.820
frigidarium,
but with radiating alcoves;

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.039
and then all of these other
rooms disposed among them

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.030
symmetrically.
 

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.355
Now what's very interesting
also, in terms of more

00:41:17.355 --> 00:41:23.800
architecture in later times,
is the Baths of Diocletian were

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.422
also reused,
but in this case not for a

00:41:27.422 --> 00:41:30.559
single building but for a
variety of buildings,

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:34.159
including a major museum of
antiquities,

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:36.530
a planetarium,
and also a church,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.159
the famous Church of Santa
Maria degli Angeli,

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:41.610
Saint Mary of the Angels.
 

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.300
Now while this plan is still on
the screen,

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.304
I want to show you when the
Church of Santa Maria degli

00:41:48.304 --> 00:41:51.510
Angeli was redesigned--
and one of the redesigners,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.282
by the way,
was Michelangelo--when it was

00:41:54.282 --> 00:41:58.090
redesigned what they did was
they took the alcove--

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.043
from where we're standing the
bottom alcove of the

00:42:01.043 --> 00:42:04.246
caldarium--
they used that as the curved

00:42:04.246 --> 00:42:06.460
faÃ§ade of their church.
 

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.360
They used the tepidarium
as the vestibule.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.065
They used the
frigidarium as the main

00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:14.449
space of the church.
 

00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:19.349
And also and they--and so that
becomes the church,

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:22.340
that main, the bottom part of
the caldarium,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.217
the tepidarium,
and the frigidarium

00:42:24.217 --> 00:42:25.000
become the church.
 

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.045
And then some of these other
spaces are used again for other

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.420
kinds of buildings,
including a planetarium.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.621
I call your attention
especially to the ones at the

00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:36.264
upper right and the upper left,
both of which are octagonal

00:42:36.264 --> 00:42:38.838
spaces,
as you can see comparable to

00:42:38.838 --> 00:42:42.489
earlier octagonal spaces under
Nero or under Domitian.

00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:45.773
And one of those rooms,
this one to our right,

00:42:45.773 --> 00:42:49.639
but to the left when you're
facing the entrance to the

00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:53.070
church today,
is still very well preserved;

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.889
and I'm going to show you that
in a moment.

00:42:54.889 --> 00:42:57.170
First here's a view into the
church,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.880
into the nave of Santa Maria
degli Angeli,

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.016
which again what you're looking
at is the original

00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:07.090
frigidarium of the Baths
of Diocletian.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.617
You can see all the things one
usually sees in a

00:43:09.617 --> 00:43:12.097
frigidarium,
and I show you a restored view

00:43:12.097 --> 00:43:14.304
of what we think the
frigidarium of the Baths

00:43:14.304 --> 00:43:16.079
of Caracalla looked like in
antiquity.

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:19.659
And you can see there's a close
resemblance between the two.

00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:21.230
The groin vaults are still
preserved.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.480
We see original columns here,
granite columns,

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.768
with capitals--some of the
capitals are ancient,

00:43:26.768 --> 00:43:29.760
some of them are not--and we
see a lot of color,

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:35.559
just as we would've seen in the
original Baths of Diocletian.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:39.614
One difference is that we see
the groin vaults in the Santa

00:43:39.614 --> 00:43:43.251
Maria degli Angeli are white,
and that is the work of

00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:44.440
Michelangelo.
 

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.869
Michelangelo decided that he
wanted something much plainer

00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:50.760
for the vaulting of Santa Maria
degli Angeli,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.579
and it was he who stuccoed it
over,

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:56.110
and no one ever dared to change
Michelangelo's work.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:59.768
But another architect by the
name of Luigi Vanvitelli,

00:43:59.768 --> 00:44:02.849
V-a-n-v-i-t-e-l-l-i--love the
name,

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:07.740
Luigi Vanvitelli--was at work
in the Santa Maria degli Angeli

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.949
interior,
in the eighteenth century;

00:44:09.949 --> 00:44:12.659
precisely in 1749.
 

00:44:12.659 --> 00:44:17.090
He came in to spruce up the
decoration,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.873
and it was Vanvitelli who added
to the original Roman granite

00:44:21.873 --> 00:44:24.567
columns,
who added these mottled--you

00:44:24.567 --> 00:44:28.054
see these mottled pilasters;
I'll show you a detail of them

00:44:28.054 --> 00:44:30.833
in a moment with their
capitals--some new capitals to

00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:32.760
match the ancient Roman
capitals.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.976
He added a lot of the stucco
decoration that you see here

00:44:35.976 --> 00:44:38.213
now,
and a lot of the altarpieces

00:44:38.213 --> 00:44:40.291
were put in,
in the seventeenth and

00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:43.188
eighteenth century,
to make it the church that it

00:44:43.188 --> 00:44:44.300
needed to become.
 

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.349
But if I show you a detail of
Vanvitelli's work,

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:49.829
you can see--you know,
as you stand in Santa Maria

00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:52.103
degli Angeli,
one tries to figure out what's

00:44:52.103 --> 00:44:55.356
ancient and what is modern--
but you can see here what seems

00:44:55.356 --> 00:44:58.373
to be a granite shaft,
from an ancient column,

00:44:58.373 --> 00:45:01.677
with a new Corinthian capital,
designed by Vanvitelli,

00:45:01.677 --> 00:45:04.710
that imitates those,
the Roman ones that are there.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.559
But all of this mottled work,
and all of the stucco

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:10.978
decoration that you see over
here, added by Vanvitelli in the

00:45:10.978 --> 00:45:12.289
eighteenth century.
 

00:45:12.289 --> 00:45:15.416
But you've seen enough Roman,
ancient Roman architecture,

00:45:15.416 --> 00:45:18.880
especially of the baroque kind,
to know that this sort of thing

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.500
did exist in Roman times.
 

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.565
And I think Vanvitelli has
actually done a pretty good job

00:45:23.565 --> 00:45:27.007
of giving us a sense of what the
figidarium of these baths

00:45:27.007 --> 00:45:29.860
would have looked like in the
time of Diocletian.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.978
Now here's the faÃ§ade,
and so you see exactly what I

00:45:32.978 --> 00:45:34.000
described before.
 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.179
This is one of the alcoves.
 

00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:38.536
You can see the concrete
brick-faced alcove that they

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:40.668
have--I mean,
this is the simplest

00:45:40.668 --> 00:45:42.800
faÃ§ade of any in Rome.
 

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.119
There's nothing quite like this.
 

00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:47.605
But it's so typical of the
Italians to take wonderful

00:45:47.605 --> 00:45:49.550
advantage of what there is.
 

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.588
And so in this case they
decided best to leave it as it

00:45:52.588 --> 00:45:53.730
is;
it speaks for itself.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.190
They just use that alcove.
 

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.159
They added a couple of doors,
created a niche,

00:45:58.159 --> 00:46:00.771
slapped the name,
Basilica Santa Maria degli

00:46:00.771 --> 00:46:01.945
Angeli,
on the front,

00:46:01.945 --> 00:46:03.599
very simply,
put a cross at the top,

00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:06.420
and this became the
faÃ§ade into the church,

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.550
and it has remained this,
to this day.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.590
Here's another view of the
Baths of Diocletian,

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:14.980
as they look today.
 

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.054
We're looking at the outside,
where we can see the outside of

00:46:19.054 --> 00:46:22.653
the frigidarium,
with its windows and its groin

00:46:22.653 --> 00:46:25.099
vaulting exposed on the outside.
 

00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:28.190
This is the tepidarium,
and the roofing of the

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.380
tepidarium.
 

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:33.099
And over here you can see the
curved faÃ§ade that's--

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:35.177
the part of the
caldarium that survives

00:46:35.177 --> 00:46:36.980
uses the faÃ§ade of the
church.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.972
And then as you stand here,
if you go to the right,

00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:43.621
you can go and look at what one
of those octagonal rooms looks

00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:44.518
like today.
 

00:46:44.518 --> 00:46:47.572
And what they've done,
they've taken advantage--this

00:46:47.572 --> 00:46:49.070
is a spectacular space.
 

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.264
This was just--we don't know
exactly what purpose this served

00:46:52.264 --> 00:46:55.045
in the bath originally,
but it's actually a space

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:58.226
that's more similar to the
caldarium of Caracalla's

00:46:58.226 --> 00:47:01.800
Baths than it is to anything
else in the Baths of Diocletian.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.646
But you can see that they have
taken advantage of this

00:47:04.646 --> 00:47:08.202
extraordinary octagonal shape,
with radiating alcoves,

00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:11.380
going back to Nero's Domus
Transitoria,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.050
Domus Aurea,
to use as a place to display

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.992
some of the greatest works of
sculpture in the part of these

00:47:17.992 --> 00:47:20.530
baths that now serves as a
museum.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.043
One very interesting feature
though that I want to point out

00:47:23.043 --> 00:47:24.532
to you,
that will be important for

00:47:24.532 --> 00:47:27.150
something later we talk about
today and for Tuesday's lecture,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.871
is the fact that you do see
them using here windows in the

00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:34.768
lower part of the dome:
windows,

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:38.150
arcuated windows,
to allow light into the system.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.182
We see this development in late
antiquity where they move from

00:47:41.182 --> 00:47:44.117
providing light through the
oculus to providing light

00:47:44.117 --> 00:47:45.710
through a series of windows.
 

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:48.858
And again they're sophisticated
enough in their use of concrete

00:47:48.858 --> 00:47:51.449
to be able to do that,
and we see that's a trend.

00:47:51.449 --> 00:47:57.471
Diocletian was as interested in
private architecture as he was

00:47:57.471 --> 00:47:59.940
in public architecture.
 

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.230
He was a man--you can tell a
lot about him just from what

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.170
I've told you.
 

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.492
He was very organized and he
planned ahead for his own

00:48:07.492 --> 00:48:10.465
abdication eventually,
his own retirement,

00:48:10.465 --> 00:48:14.313
and he wanted to live
ultimately back where his roots

00:48:14.313 --> 00:48:16.047
were,
on the Croatian,

00:48:16.047 --> 00:48:17.650
on the Dalmatian Coast.
 

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:23.126
And he built for himself a
palace in a place called Split,

00:48:23.126 --> 00:48:25.530
in what is now Croatia.
 

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.460
And I show you again the map of
this part of the world.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.358
If you look at Pola,
that we--I can't reach it from

00:48:32.358 --> 00:48:34.626
where I am,
but if you look at Pola,

00:48:34.626 --> 00:48:36.811
where that is,
and down the Dalmatian Coast,

00:48:36.811 --> 00:48:39.059
you'll see Split,
right below that.

00:48:39.059 --> 00:48:40.619
Dubrovnik is at the base.
 

00:48:40.619 --> 00:48:43.092
This is actually a view I took
of Dubrovnik,

00:48:43.092 --> 00:48:46.139
just to give you a sense of
this part of the world.

00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:51.173
It's magnificently beautiful
there, and one can imagine why

00:48:51.173 --> 00:48:56.730
Diocletian was drawn to return
to his homeland for his palace.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.193
So we are looking here at the
plan of the Palace of

00:48:59.193 --> 00:49:01.559
Diocletian, which is extremely
well preserved;

00:49:01.559 --> 00:49:02.760
this is from Ward-Perkins.
 

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.614
And you should be immediately
struck by this palace,

00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:13.039
because it--which dates,
by the way, to 300 to 305 A.D.

00:49:13.039 --> 00:49:17.215
We see here something that I'm
sure you've all noticed already,

00:49:17.215 --> 00:49:21.054
and that is that he has built
this palace in the form of a

00:49:21.054 --> 00:49:24.739
Roman castrum;
it's a Roman military camp.

00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:27.673
It is a little city;
it's a city in its own right,

00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:30.170
in the form of a Roman military
camp.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.079
Why did he do that?
 

00:49:31.079 --> 00:49:32.110
That's interesting.
 

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.327
Well I think it had something
to do with the fact that the

00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:37.360
structure was located on the
sea,

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.358
right on a promontory on the
sea, and could easily have been

00:49:42.358 --> 00:49:43.289
attacked.
 

00:49:43.289 --> 00:49:45.760
And times were still--he was
still--

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.179
he had brought stability back,
yes,

00:49:47.179 --> 00:49:51.268
but he was very aware of what
had preceded him,

00:49:51.268 --> 00:49:54.880
in the third century,
and desirous of protecting

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.340
himself and his possessions in
his palace,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.735
on the Dalmatian Coast,
and so he builds it in the form

00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:03.119
of a castrum.
 

00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:07.907
You can see all the elements of
a typical Roman military camp,

00:50:07.907 --> 00:50:11.597
just as we saw in city
building, urban planning,

00:50:11.597 --> 00:50:13.559
from the Republic on.
 

00:50:13.559 --> 00:50:15.239
It's rectangular in shape.
 

00:50:15.239 --> 00:50:15.929
It has walls.
 

00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:19.108
It has watchtowers;
you can see they are

00:50:19.108 --> 00:50:22.500
alternately rectangular and
octagonal watchtowers.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.420
It has entrances and exits.
 

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.630
It has a cardo and a
decumanus that cross at

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.489
the intersection of the palace.
 

00:50:29.489 --> 00:50:34.130
You can see there are--the main
gateway is on the northern side;

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.000
the southern side faces the sea.
 

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.190
As you walk from the northern
entranceway,

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.730
along the cardo and the
decumanus,

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:43.123
so to speak,
of this palace,

00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:45.239
you will see that they are
colonnaded,

00:50:45.239 --> 00:50:48.230
just as they usually are in the
eastern part of the Empire,

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.280
but not in the western part of
the Empire.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.635
As you walk along from the
entranceway, you enter into a

00:50:53.635 --> 00:50:55.956
public court over here,
very elaborate,

00:50:55.956 --> 00:50:59.130
that's still preserved,
with an arcuated lintel;

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.590
I'm going to show you that in a
moment.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.179
Then into this domed area here,
with alcoves.

00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:10.099
But note that on either side of
this open space,

00:51:10.099 --> 00:51:13.170
with the arcuated lintel,
which is called the peristyle

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.489
of the villa,
you can see on one side a small

00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:18.706
temple,
which is a temple to Jupiter,

00:51:18.706 --> 00:51:22.242
the patron god of Diocletian,
and on the other side a

00:51:22.242 --> 00:51:24.739
mausoleum, an octagonal tomb.
 

00:51:24.739 --> 00:51:27.489
Now that should strike you as
very interesting and very

00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:28.000
unusual.
 

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.050
We have not seen a tomb as part
of palace architecture before.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.099
This is new, to late antiquity.
 

00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:38.516
This probably has to do in part
with again Diocletian planning

00:51:38.516 --> 00:51:40.420
this as his place of retirement.
 

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.920
He knew he was going to retire
there,

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.503
he knew he was going to die
there, and he wanted to make

00:51:44.503 --> 00:51:46.570
sure that he supplied for
himself a tomb--

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.407
he was not going to be buried
in one of these major mausolea

00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:51.996
in Rome;
he wanted to be buried at home,

00:51:51.996 --> 00:51:55.530
and so he plans for this by
building an octagonal--

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.500
not a round,
like Augustus and Hadrian--

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.820
but an octagonal tomb,
with a porch here in the villa.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.585
And note that it is right
across from the Temple of

00:52:04.585 --> 00:52:07.170
Jupiter;
no coincidence there.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.485
Go through the domed room,
domed space,

00:52:09.485 --> 00:52:11.739
into the private wing of the
house.

00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:15.018
You see a room here with a
basilican shape.

00:52:15.018 --> 00:52:17.039
We're not exactly sure what it
was used for,

00:52:17.039 --> 00:52:19.059
but probably some kind of
reception hall.

00:52:19.059 --> 00:52:22.994
And then here a series of
interestingly shaped rooms,

00:52:22.994 --> 00:52:27.610
that was where the emperor's
private quarters were located.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:31.358
This is a restored view of what
this fortressed palace would

00:52:31.358 --> 00:52:34.407
have looked like,
when it was built in the fourth

00:52:34.407 --> 00:52:35.170
century.
 

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.460
We see here all of the things
I've already described:

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.619
the outer walls;
the watchtowers;

00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:44.690
the entranceway on the north;
the colonnaded streets.

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.382
You can see the octagonal tomb
rising up over there,

00:52:48.382 --> 00:52:50.989
across from the Temple of
Jupiter;

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:54.739
and then down here the private
area, the private wing.

00:52:54.739 --> 00:52:57.630
And you can see how the
southern side faces the sea,

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:01.199
and there seems to have been an
arcuated lintel on that side.

00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:04.021
We've seen that that's grown in
influence and importance since

00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:06.010
it was first used in the time of
Hadrian.

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:11.228
This is the Porta Aurea,
or the northern gate of the

00:53:11.228 --> 00:53:12.150
palace.
 

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:15.309
You see it in a restored view
from Ward-Perkins.

00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:18.266
Rectangular entranceway,
lintel, window-like,

00:53:18.266 --> 00:53:21.248
with grates above;
niches on either side,

00:53:21.248 --> 00:53:23.110
with arcuated pediments.
 

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:26.588
But most interestingly is the
upper tier where you see a

00:53:26.588 --> 00:53:29.940
series of columns on brackets
that support arcades.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.518
This whole idea of arcades on
columns began,

00:53:34.518 --> 00:53:38.344
as we know, later in antiquity,
and continues to be important

00:53:38.344 --> 00:53:41.469
into the late third and early
fourth centuries.

00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:45.791
We saw it at the Severan Forum
at Leptis Magna,

00:53:45.791 --> 00:53:50.864
where you can see again
columns, this arcaded colonnade

00:53:50.864 --> 00:53:51.710
here.
 

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:54.244
We saw it in residential
architecture at Ostia,

00:53:54.244 --> 00:53:56.010
late residential architecture.
 

00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:00.166
Think of the House of Fortuna
Annonaria where we have those

00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:04.608
columns with arches above them
that separate the fountain court

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:06.829
from the triclinium.
 

00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:09.172
So I just wanted to make the
point that we see it not only at

00:54:09.172 --> 00:54:12.119
Diocletian's Palace,
but it's very common in late

00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:15.780
Roman residential and civic
architecture as well.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.980
This is a view of the peristyle
as it looks today.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.686
We are walking--we've come from
the North Gate,

00:54:21.686 --> 00:54:24.690
we're walking along,
we're hitting the peristyle.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:27.431
We're going to be going from
the peristyle into that domed

00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:28.010
area here.
 

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.860
Imagine views through the
columns of the peristyle--

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.329
and some of those columns are
still preserved,

00:54:33.329 --> 00:54:35.610
as you can see them,
the original columns--

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.998
views clearly of the Temple of
Jupiter and of the Mausoleum of

00:54:39.998 --> 00:54:42.230
Diocletian on the other side.
 

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:46.610
Arcuated lintel here inside a
complete pediment.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:50.838
So that scheme also used as the
major decoration of the

00:54:50.838 --> 00:54:53.969
peristyle in the Palace of
Diocletian.

00:54:53.969 --> 00:54:57.699
Here's a view of what the small
Temple of Jupiter looks like.

00:54:57.699 --> 00:55:00.300
We're looking--it originally
had a statue of Jupiter;

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.054
now it has a statue of St.
 

00:55:02.054 --> 00:55:03.268
John the Baptist.
 

00:55:03.268 --> 00:55:07.855
But you can see the shape --
very much like the Curia,

00:55:07.855 --> 00:55:09.500
a box-like shape.
 

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.708
Very simple,
in this case not with a flat

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:14.028
coffered ceiling,
but with a barrel vaulted

00:55:14.028 --> 00:55:15.190
coffered ceiling.
 

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:17.130
But again very simple,
very geometric.

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:20.119
And we can see that that barrel
vault is exposed on the

00:55:20.119 --> 00:55:20.730
exterior.
 

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:23.878
We can see the shape of the
barrel vault from the outside,

00:55:23.878 --> 00:55:25.480
as well as from the inside.
 

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.449
Here a view of the octagonal
tomb.

00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:32.469
The plan of that tomb:
an octagon with colonnade

00:55:32.469 --> 00:55:34.449
around it;
columns on the inside;

00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:37.139
radiating rectangular and
curved niches.

00:55:37.139 --> 00:55:38.875
But a porch,
the whole idea of the

00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:41.873
porch--not unlike the Pantheon,
except that it's octagonal

00:55:41.873 --> 00:55:44.030
instead of round--porch on the
front;

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:46.280
deep porch;
freestanding columns;

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.409
faÃ§ade orientation;
single staircase.

00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:53.190
So this is very similar to
things that we've seen earlier.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:58.697
And two quick views,
one an engraving of what the

00:55:58.697 --> 00:56:01.494
mausoleum,
the octagonal mausoleum would

00:56:01.494 --> 00:56:04.001
have looked like,
with its--you can see it's

00:56:04.001 --> 00:56:06.699
faced with stone--
with its entranceway

00:56:06.699 --> 00:56:08.860
faÃ§ade and staircase.
 

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.764
And here you can see it is very
well preserved still today,

00:56:12.764 --> 00:56:16.130
in Split, where you see the
surrounding columns.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.588
You can see the octagonal shape
and the stonework,

00:56:19.588 --> 00:56:23.260
all still very well preserved,
as is the interior.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.797
The interior very ornate,
with columns projecting from

00:56:27.797 --> 00:56:30.297
the walls,
supporting these projecting

00:56:30.297 --> 00:56:31.983
entablatures,
deeply drilled,

00:56:31.983 --> 00:56:34.420
dematerialized,
in the baroque manner,

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.943
with lots of sculptural
decoration: representations of

00:56:37.943 --> 00:56:41.961
victory and death--
victory over hunting and

00:56:41.961 --> 00:56:45.702
victory in war--
and consequently this close

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:47.355
association,
as we've seen,

00:56:47.355 --> 00:56:48.320
among all of those.
 

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.827
And then scenes of both,
with a portrait of Diocletian

00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:57.110
and a portrait of his wife,
Prisca, both of those being

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.215
carried in these wreaths,
up to the heavens,

00:57:00.215 --> 00:57:01.590
by flying cupids.
 

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:04.396
Here's another view,
perhaps a better one that just

00:57:04.396 --> 00:57:07.429
gives you some of the sense of
the over-decoration,

00:57:07.429 --> 00:57:10.440
over-ornamentation,
the baroque effects of the

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.980
interior of the tomb.
 

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.219
So a very different feel to the
Temple of Jupiter,

00:57:15.219 --> 00:57:17.929
than to the Tomb of Diocletian
himself.

00:57:17.929 --> 00:57:21.780
Here he's gone all out and
commissioned the most ornate

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.847
possible decoration,
with all the baroque effects

00:57:24.847 --> 00:57:27.355
that we've described,
in two tiers,

00:57:27.355 --> 00:57:30.949
for the interior of his
mausoleum.

00:57:30.949 --> 00:57:34.329
I want to show you a succession
of other palaces,

00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:37.608
each fairly quickly,
other palaces that were built

00:57:37.608 --> 00:57:40.373
during this period,
that may have been--well in

00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:43.543
some cases we know for sure,
but in other cases we're not as

00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:46.789
sure whether they were in fact
palaces for the Tetrarchs.

00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:48.480
This is the one that's the
least certain.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.373
It's a palace in the western
part of the Empire that we

00:57:52.373 --> 00:57:56.699
believe may have been the palace
of Maximian, Augustus in the

00:57:56.699 --> 00:57:57.349
West.
 

00:57:57.349 --> 00:58:01.199
And in fact I should--yes,
so let's look at that first.

00:58:01.199 --> 00:58:03.043
And that dates,
as you can see from your

00:58:03.043 --> 00:58:05.172
Monument List,
to sometime in the early fourth

00:58:05.172 --> 00:58:05.929
century A.D.
 

00:58:05.929 --> 00:58:08.150
Now if you look at the plan of
this quickly,

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:13.210
you will see that it is very,
very different in feel from--

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.820
and in plan--from the Palace of
Diocletian at Split.

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.557
This may have something to do
with the personality of

00:58:19.557 --> 00:58:21.655
Maximian,
or whoever the commissioner

00:58:21.655 --> 00:58:24.969
was, but it may also have to do
with the fact that this is not

00:58:24.969 --> 00:58:28.230
on the sea but in a remote town
in south-central Sicily,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:34.414
which was much less likely to
be under attack than the palace

00:58:34.414 --> 00:58:35.550
at Split.
 

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:39.231
In fact, as you look at this,
you must be reminded,

00:58:39.231 --> 00:58:42.619
I'm sure, of the Villa of
Hadrian at Tivoli;

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:47.005
it is very similar to that:
a sprawling villa with a series

00:58:47.005 --> 00:58:49.880
of very interestingly shaped
rooms,

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.690
spread across the terrain,
interacting with nature,

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:56.449
just as they did at Hadrian's
Villa at Tivoli.

00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:59.737
Very much a countryside villa,
and I think Hadrian's Villa

00:58:59.737 --> 00:59:01.179
clearly the main model.
 

00:59:01.179 --> 00:59:03.414
As we walk through this
axonometric view,

00:59:03.414 --> 00:59:05.539
you see we enter on the western
end.

00:59:05.539 --> 00:59:10.565
At 1 we see a horseshoe shaped
vestibule, with columns all

00:59:10.565 --> 00:59:13.838
around this villa;
just like Hadrian's Villa at

00:59:13.838 --> 00:59:15.780
Tivoli, does have a lot of
columns.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.480
We see those here.
 

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.090
Then you make an abrupt right
into this passageway here,

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:22.929
at 2(a).
 

00:59:22.929 --> 00:59:26.246
Then into the peristyle court,
with columns all the way

00:59:26.246 --> 00:59:28.034
around;
a pool in the center,

00:59:28.034 --> 00:59:30.619
an interestingly shaped pool in
the center;

00:59:30.619 --> 00:59:34.389
and then a series of living
spaces, to either side.

00:59:34.389 --> 00:59:40.349
On 2(c) we see a transverse
corridor,

00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:43.985
which is very important because
it links various parts of the

00:59:43.985 --> 00:59:46.860
villa to one another,
but it was also very decorated

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.900
with mosaics,
many of which are preserved;

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.659
and I'll show you those in a
moment.

00:59:50.659 --> 00:59:54.248
2(d), with its niche at the end;
probably a kind of audience

00:59:54.248 --> 00:59:56.181
hall;
3 is where the private

00:59:56.181 --> 01:00:00.605
compartment is for the emperor,
and you can see that that too

01:00:00.605 --> 01:00:04.070
is fronted by a small horseshoe
shaped area.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:07.532
Then over here,
at 4, we see a tri-lobed dining

01:00:07.532 --> 01:00:09.385
room;
the main dining room of the

01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:10.809
house with the triple lobes.
 

01:00:10.809 --> 01:00:15.179
And then down below a forecourt
for that that is oval in shape.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:17.780
So some very interestingly
shaped rooms,

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.400
and where we see a combination
of the interest in curvilinear

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.657
shapes,
just as in Hadrian's Villa,

01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:26.920
and in the use of columnar
architecture;

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.679
references to Classical Greece.
 

01:00:28.679 --> 01:00:31.460
Over here, at 5,
we see several rooms,

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.596
very interestingly shaped
again, that make up the baths,

01:00:35.596 --> 01:00:39.130
the private baths of this
particular place.

01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:41.590
One can visit it still today.
 

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.320
Parts of it are very well
preserved.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.920
We're clearly looking at the
peristyle court with the pool in

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.780
the center of it,
right here.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.570
And again it is particularly
well known for its mosaics.

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:55.610
We see a long corridor here,
with those mosaics.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:59.103
They depict primarily scenes of
hunting, and I show you a couple

01:00:59.103 --> 01:01:00.380
of those scenes here.
 

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.005
And there's been some
speculation that this was not

01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:05.257
Maximian's,
that it may have belonged to

01:01:05.257 --> 01:01:07.523
somebody who,
like those individuals who had

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:09.268
the Hunting Baths at Leptis
Magna,

01:01:09.268 --> 01:01:15.539
whose work it was to collect
wild animals from Africa--

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:18.297
Africa is very close to
Sicily--collect them from Africa

01:01:18.297 --> 01:01:22.597
and send them,
to supply them to amphitheaters

01:01:22.597 --> 01:01:24.599
around the world.
 

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:27.960
But even though most of these
scenes are hunting scenes,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:34.070
the most famous mosaics from
the Palace of Maximian,

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.610
so-called, at Piazza Armerina
in Sicily,

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:41.469
are the so-called bikini girls,
and I show you the bikini girls

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:42.280
right here.
 

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.686
And there's nothing like this
mosaic anywhere else in Roman

01:01:45.686 --> 01:01:46.039
art.
 

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:48.795
But you can see why they're
called the bikini girls,

01:01:48.795 --> 01:01:52.039
and they are involved in all
kinds of athletic activities.

01:01:52.039 --> 01:01:58.041
One of them has received a
crown and a palm branch for her

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.409
excellence.
 

01:01:59.409 --> 01:02:02.599
This one is twirling who knows
what here.

01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:06.360
These two are
playing--passing--playing ball.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.956
And over here we see a woman on
the left with her five-pound

01:02:09.956 --> 01:02:11.360
weights, working out.
 

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.800
So, I mean, this is probably as
close as we get to--

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.619
one doesn't--this is very hard
to interpret exactly what this

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:19.969
means and what it's all about
and why it's here.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:24.215
But perhaps we can see it as a
kind of women's version to the

01:02:24.215 --> 01:02:27.329
mosaic that we saw in the Baths
of Caracalla,

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:30.159
with the famous athletes of the
day;

01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:34.023
I mean, perhaps these were
famous women athletes of the

01:02:34.023 --> 01:02:37.742
day, some of whom were good
enough even to be awarded

01:02:37.742 --> 01:02:38.530
prizes.
 

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.233
But the jury is out on exactly
what these were and why they're

01:02:42.233 --> 01:02:42.719
there.
 

01:02:42.719 --> 01:02:45.849
But they're memorable,
these inimitable bikini girls,

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.650
and very, very famous -- along
with the Alexander Mosaic,

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:53.420
probably the most famous mosaic
surviving from Roman antiquity.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.081
Again I want to show you just
very briefly,

01:02:56.081 --> 01:02:59.440
to give you an inkling of a
couple of more palaces.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.951
One of these we know for sure
is the Palace of Galerius in the

01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:09.469
northern part of Greece,
the Palace of Galerius.

01:03:09.469 --> 01:03:16.456
Galerius, as you'll recall,
was the Caesar in the eastern

01:03:16.456 --> 01:03:20.949
part of the Empire,
to Diocletian.

01:03:20.949 --> 01:03:24.554
And I should mention--I think I
neglected to mention--that

01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:27.338
Diocletian did,
by the way, abdicate on the 1

01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:28.730
of May in 305 A.D.
 

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:33.679
He voluntarily stepped down,
and when he voluntarily stepped

01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:37.958
down, two new--the Caesars were
elevated to Augusti,

01:03:37.958 --> 01:03:40.980
and two new Caesars were
chosen;

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.530
two new Caesars were chosen.
 

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:46.523
And Galerius became an
Augustus, and he built for

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:51.018
himself this extraordinary
palace in northern Greece at

01:03:51.018 --> 01:03:52.099
Salonica.
 

01:03:52.099 --> 01:03:57.367
And we can see from this
plan--and I've given you the

01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:01.753
date of it, to 297 to 305 A.D.;
I've given you a plan of it,

01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:03.487
and you should be,
even though only part of it

01:04:03.487 --> 01:04:05.329
survives,
you should be immediately

01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:08.269
reminded of palaces that we've
already looked at,

01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:09.789
not just today but in the past.
 

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:13.059
Think of Domitian's Palace on
the Palatine Hill.

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:15.768
There's a hippodrome here,
just as Domitian's Palace had,

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:17.655
although Domitian's Palace,
it was used,

01:04:17.655 --> 01:04:19.639
as you'll recall,
as a sunken garden.

01:04:19.639 --> 01:04:22.681
We're not sure how it was used
here, but we think it may have

01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:24.610
actually been used as a circus
here.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:27.025
Other rooms,
including an octagonal one,

01:04:27.025 --> 01:04:29.378
with alcoves,
looking sort of like what

01:04:29.378 --> 01:04:32.353
Rabirius designed,
again for Domitian's Palace on

01:04:32.353 --> 01:04:33.840
the Palatine Hill.
 

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.922
But up above we see,
just as Diocletian's Palace at

01:04:36.922 --> 01:04:38.650
Split, it includes a tomb.
 

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:42.829
Galerius has also provided for
himself and his afterlife by

01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:44.559
creating a round tomb.
 

01:04:44.559 --> 01:04:47.820
You see the uppermost part in
this plan from Ward-Perkins.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.032
And then very interestingly,
just like Diocletian's Palace

01:04:51.032 --> 01:04:52.943
at Split,
you can see two major,

01:04:52.943 --> 01:04:55.746
what look like major roads,
colonnaded roads,

01:04:55.746 --> 01:04:59.804
colonnaded streets,
that intersect in the center,

01:04:59.804 --> 01:05:02.590
just like Diocletian's Palace.
 

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.219
And then in the center of that,
where they intersect,

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:08.050
there's a four-sided arch that
I'm going to show you in a

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:09.820
moment, that's still preserved.
 

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.967
Here's a plan of the Tomb of
Galerius, at his villa ,

01:05:14.967 --> 01:05:20.610
in this case round with
radiating, rectangular alcoves.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.030
You see it here.
 

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:23.719
It's actually very well
preserved.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.780
Here's the interior,
showing again,

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:31.110
just as we saw in the Baths
of--the octagonal room in the

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:35.030
Baths of Diocletian,
use of windows in the second

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:37.380
tier, right at the base of the
dome,

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.619
rather than an oculus.
 

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:42.230
And we see that also very well
in plan.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.739
In fact, there were two sets of
them, as you can see here.

01:05:44.739 --> 01:05:48.219
So they've abandoned the
oculus in favor of these

01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:50.369
windows at the base of the dome.
 

01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:53.867
And then from the outside you
can see that here they have used

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:57.480
concrete faced with brick for
the exterior of the structure,

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.340
which was turned into a
church--and you can see some

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.050
mosaics from when it was turned
into a church--

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:08.869
and a minaret was also added at
one other point in time.

01:06:08.869 --> 01:06:13.512
Here's a spectacular view of
the tomb as it looks today in

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:14.409
Salonica.
 

01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:16.900
You can see it here;
the exterior,

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.750
as well as its relationship
along what would have been one

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:22.045
of those colonnaded streets,
with the arch,

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:25.579
which is in part preserved --
the so-called Arch of Galerius.

01:06:25.579 --> 01:06:29.849
You can also see from this view
how similar modern Salonica is

01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:31.949
to modern Athens:
same country,

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:35.518
same World War,
post-World War II construction;

01:06:35.518 --> 01:06:39.068
mostly residential houses of
five, six, seven stories,

01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:41.077
white in color,
with balconies,

01:06:41.077 --> 01:06:42.349
as you can see.
 

01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:47.273
Here's a view of the
relationship of the tomb to the

01:06:47.273 --> 01:06:47.949
arch.
 

01:06:47.949 --> 01:06:50.757
These two colonnaded streets
that intersect,

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:54.219
and at that intersection the
placement of the arch.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:58.079
The arch was four-sided so the
streets could go underneath it.

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:01.427
But it was also triple-bayed,
as you can see here:

01:07:01.427 --> 01:07:05.000
single, central large bay;
two smaller bays on either side;

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.570
and then the piers decorated
with sculpture,

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:11.230
that give us a report on the
exploits,

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.820
the military exploits of
Galerius in the eastern part of

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:15.670
the Empire.
 

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.878
These were Galerius' wars,
Galerius' victories that are

01:07:18.878 --> 01:07:19.829
depicted here.
 

01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:24.139
But we do believe that since it
was one for all and all for one,

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:26.518
that it honored the Tetrarchy
as a whole as well,

01:07:26.518 --> 01:07:30.445
and that there were niches that
were placed somewhere on this

01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:32.889
arch,
that would have had in them

01:07:32.889 --> 01:07:36.335
representations,
portraits, of each of the four

01:07:36.335 --> 01:07:37.130
Tetrarchs.
 

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:40.476
Another view of the Arch of
Galerius, at Salonica,

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:42.800
where you can see its
relationship,

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.148
even today, to what was once
the Tomb of Galerius,

01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:46.900
here.
 

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:52.389
And a more detailed view of
some of the scenes,

01:07:52.389 --> 01:07:56.710
and how crowded they are,
with one rectangular panel,

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.527
piled one on top of another,
and decorative motifs in

01:07:59.527 --> 01:08:00.340
between them.
 

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.409
And if we look at a detail,
we see the usual scenes that we

01:08:03.409 --> 01:08:06.110
see on things like this:
the emperor sacrificing;

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:09.300
the emperor on horseback,
trampling barbarian enemies;

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.275
the emperor seated,
with the other Tetrarchs down

01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:15.128
here, and with a host of gods
and goddesses and

01:08:15.128 --> 01:08:16.430
personifications.
 

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.622
So again an honoring of
Galerius' own personal

01:08:19.622 --> 01:08:23.948
victories, but an expansion of
those to include reference also

01:08:23.948 --> 01:08:26.220
to the Tetrarchy as a whole.
 

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.810
We're going to be talking next
time about two men in

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:34.104
particular: a man by the name of
Maxentius and Constantine the

01:08:34.104 --> 01:08:34.810
Great.
 

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.283
Constantine the Great,
as I've already mentioned,

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:39.189
was the son of Constantius
Chlorus.

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:41.420
Maxentius was the son of
Maximian.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.832
So we see the generations
continue, and the sons of the

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:47.738
Tetrarchs also want to be
Tetrarchs themselves,

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.130
if not sole ruler.
 

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.408
And we'll see Maxentius and
Constantine do battle against

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:54.460
one another in Tuesday's
lecture.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.863
But I just want to
mention--we'll talk about

01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:58.988
Maxentius in some detail next
time,

01:08:58.988 --> 01:09:01.488
especially his construction,
or the beginning,

01:09:01.488 --> 01:09:04.729
his beginning construction on a
great basilica in Rome,

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:06.658
that Constantine eventually
finished,

01:09:06.658 --> 01:09:09.039
the so-called Basilica of
Maxentius/Constantine,

01:09:09.039 --> 01:09:10.359
or the Basilica Nova.
 

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.960
But I want to mention just in
passing today a villa,

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.430
about a villa that Maxentius
built in Rome,

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.551
on the Via Appia in Rome,
just to round the circle and to

01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:22.340
show you that some of these
palaces were still--

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.500
they were being built in these
capitals elsewhere in the world,

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.328
but were still being built in
Rome.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:30.261
And we know that Maxentius
built a villa in the early

01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:33.078
fourth century A.D.,
as I said on the Via Appia.

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:35.279
And there are some remains of
it today.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.350
I show you a general view of
those here,

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:40.920
and a view, from the air,
from Ward-Perkins I believe,

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.130
that shows you that part of
that villa,

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:45.292
which is still preserved,
was another one of these

01:09:45.292 --> 01:09:46.439
hippodromes, the circus.
 

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:49.912
And in this case we know that
this circus was used as a

01:09:49.912 --> 01:09:53.773
circus--horse races took place
here--and that it was built to

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:57.938
hold 15,000 spectators;
15,000 spectators to come out

01:09:57.938 --> 01:10:02.880
onto the Via Appia to see horse
races at Maxentius' villa.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.011
We also know that this villa
had a tomb that Maxentius

01:10:06.011 --> 01:10:08.963
provided for himself,
and perhaps for his family as

01:10:08.963 --> 01:10:10.560
well, inside his villa.
 

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.689
So we see the same idea that
we've seen in the provinces,

01:10:13.689 --> 01:10:16.500
being used in Rome
concurrently,

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.670
a tomb that is not all that
well preserved,

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:24.337
but there is enough where we do
believe it was a kind of mini

01:10:24.337 --> 01:10:25.010
Pantheon.
 

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:28.250
And I show it to you here in
two restored views that give you

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.488
a sense of what it would have
looked like: that it was indeed

01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:33.510
a mini Pantheon;
that it was round;

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:36.189
that it had a traditional porch
in the front,

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:38.010
with columns and pediments,
deep porch,

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:40.460
freestanding columns,
single staircase,

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.649
faÃ§ade orientation,
domed as you can see here.

01:10:43.649 --> 01:10:45.960
This one looks like it
reconstructs an oculus,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.314
although I don't think we're
absolutely sure that this

01:10:48.314 --> 01:10:51.516
structure had an oculus;
which seems an unlikely thing

01:10:51.516 --> 01:10:54.358
to do with a tomb anyway,
to have an opening in the

01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:57.538
ceiling and rain coming,
water coming into that tomb.

01:10:57.538 --> 01:11:00.430
But leaving that particular
detail aside,

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.899
we believe it was in the form
of the Pantheon.

01:11:03.899 --> 01:11:06.288
A better preserved tomb that I
can show you,

01:11:06.288 --> 01:11:07.770
that seems to have been quite
like it,

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:10.600
is this last monument that I'm
showing you today,

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.726
the Tor de'Schiavi,
a restored view from

01:11:13.726 --> 01:11:17.194
Ward-Perkins,
that was a tomb that was put up

01:11:17.194 --> 01:11:18.180
in around A.D.
 

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.998
300 on one of Rome's other
major streets,

01:11:20.998 --> 01:11:24.100
the Via Praenestina,
as I've indicated on the

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:25.510
Monument List.
 

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:28.988
And once again we see this
whole idea of the mini Pantheon,

01:11:28.988 --> 01:11:31.510
being used not as a temple to
all the gods,

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:34.167
but as a tomb;
as a tomb, a round structure

01:11:34.167 --> 01:11:36.420
with a traditional porch on the
front,

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.698
a rectangular pediment,
deep porch,

01:11:39.698 --> 01:11:41.390
freestanding columns in that
porch,

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:44.658
single staircase faÃ§ade,
emphasis here.

01:11:44.658 --> 01:11:47.448
You also see,
interestingly enough,

01:11:47.448 --> 01:11:49.750
that this one we know did not
have an oculus,

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.837
and you can see that they have
put windows at the base to

01:11:52.837 --> 01:11:53.720
provide light.
 

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.760
These are not the usual windows
that we've seen,

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.729
that were arcuated at the top,
but rather round windows,

01:11:58.729 --> 01:12:02.948
sort of portholes,
into this particular tomb.

01:12:02.948 --> 01:12:05.954
Up above you see the plan,
as in Ward-Perkins,

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:08.827
round with radiating,
alternating curved and

01:12:08.827 --> 01:12:10.430
rectangular alcoves.
 

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:14.206
There is some controversy about
the porch, whether it had a

01:12:14.206 --> 01:12:16.680
regular, complete,
triangular pediment,

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.350
or whether it had an arcuated
lintel.

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.100
We're not sure.
 

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.948
Various scholars have put
forward one view or the other.

01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:27.377
But the last thought that I
want to leave you with is that

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:30.925
it's very interesting to see
these mini Pantheons being used

01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:34.766
as tombs in late antiquity,
by the Tetrarchs and by others,

01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:38.627
and if not mini Pantheons,
octagonal structures that also

01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:40.260
look back to the past.
 

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.270
And I think that's important,
and it's a nice note to end on,

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:46.921
because it reminds us that when
Diocletian and the other

01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:50.654
Tetrarchs come into Rome,
after the chaos of the third

01:12:50.654 --> 01:12:52.929
century A.D.,
and want to establish

01:12:52.929 --> 01:12:56.220
stability--once again,
re-establish stability--what do

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:56.670
they do?
 

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:57.810
They look to the past.
 

01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.500
They build buildings in the
Roman Forum,

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.775
but they also look to the great
architecture of their earlier

01:13:02.775 --> 01:13:05.387
counterparts,
of Caesar--of the great leaders

01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:09.288
of the Roman past--
Caesar, Augustus, Hadrian.

01:13:09.288 --> 01:13:12.020
They look to them,
they look to their buildings,

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:17.707
and they use their buildings as
models to indicate that they are

01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:21.408
in a line from those earlier
emperors,

01:13:21.408 --> 01:13:22.920
that they're just as much in
control,

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.750
that they have brought
stability back to Rome,

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:29.595
and also to the Empire as a
whole, which is why we see them

01:13:29.595 --> 01:13:33.310
building not just in Rome but
also around the Empire,

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.881
as they govern from the
fringes, as well as they govern

01:13:36.881 --> 01:13:38.470
from the city of Rome.
 

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:39.659
Thank you all.
 

01:13:39.659 --> 01:13:41.079
Have a good day.

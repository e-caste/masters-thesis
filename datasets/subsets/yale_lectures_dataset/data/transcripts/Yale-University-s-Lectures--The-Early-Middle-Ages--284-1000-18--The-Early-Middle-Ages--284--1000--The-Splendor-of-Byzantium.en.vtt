00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.100
PAUL FREEDMAN: We in the
midst of the laughs,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.200
attempted to look at the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.100
seventh century last time as a
turning point in the history

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.367
of the period that we're dealing
with, the post-Roman

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:20.667
world, the early Middle Ages.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:27.900
Certainly among the major shifts
was the rise of Islam

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.667
and the consequent radical
changes in the Mediterranean

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:37.867
territories, particularly, of
course, the areas conquered

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:43.433
from the Eastern Roman Empire
by Byzantium, namely Syria,

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:47.500
Palestine, Egypt, and eventually
North Africa.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:55.200
The seventh century, therefore,
changed the shape

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.000
of the Byzantine Empire,
and so its

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.333
orientation as well as culture.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:05.900
Here I have a kind
of periodization.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:13.167
We've spoken about Justinian's
expansion.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.767
Very shortly after his death,
there begins what seems in

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:19.767
retrospect, at least
in part, to be a

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.633
reaction to imperial overreach.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:27.867
Imperial overreach is a
phenomenon seen throughout

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:32.500
history, described most
memorably, perhaps, by our own

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.233
Paul Kennedy, the tendency for
empires simply, in order to

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.833
protect themselves or in order
to fulfill their ambitions to

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:45.600
get too large for their own
ability to hold onto their

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.233
possessions.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:51.000
This is an economic problem, a
logistical problem, a resource

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300
problem, and even a
cultural problem.

00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:00.267
In general, it's hard to say
what provokes the crisis.

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.467
That is, with the Roman Empire
as with the Abbasids, we can

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:06.833
say, "Oh, well it
was too big".

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:09.400
On the other hand, it
was too big and did

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.967
just fine for centuries.

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.233
In the case of the Abbasid
Empire, maybe not centuries,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.133
but 150 years, which as
these things go is

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.733
a pretty long time.

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:21.300
Here, however, we're talking
about something that is much

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.533
more obviously related to
some kind of overreach.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:31.133
Justinian formed his expanded
empire, which is the first map

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.367
in the handout.

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.433
And merely a few years
after his death,

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.767
it started to unravel.

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:44.433
You'll recall that we said
that he had at great cost

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.100
conquered Italy.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.433
After the easy conquest of North
Africa, this looked like

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:52.933
it would be easy as well.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:56.133
But in fact, while North
Africa, occupied by the

00:02:56.133 --> 00:03:02.067
Vandals, fell within a year or
two, Italy took twenty years

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:04.000
to wrest from the Ostrogoths.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.967
And the peninsula was devastated
and in radical

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:14.500
economic decline when
Byzantium took over.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.233
A mere three years after
Justinian's death in 568,

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:20.367
Italy was invaded
by yet another

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.567
barbarian tribe, the Lombards.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:27.000
The Lombards did not take
over all of it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.767
The Byzantine Empire--

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:33.433
Eastern Roman Empire-- managed
to hold on to Sicily, much of

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:37.800
southern Italy, the east
coast, particularly the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.933
capital of the Byzantine
province, Ravenna.

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:43.467
But nevertheless, the Lombards

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:48.300
occupied most of the peninsula.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.000
And as we'll discuss in a
moment, other disasters piled

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.200
up in this period that I have
just called contraction.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.633
But it's not just a question of
the empire getting smaller.

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:11.033
It's really a radical crisis and
an ongoing crisis with the

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:15.867
appearance of many enemies and
the radical shrinking of the

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.467
borders of this empire.

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:24.600
So again, look at the
empire in 565.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.767
It's making a good attempt at
Justinian's death to mimic the

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:33.367
Roman Empire at the beginning
of our course, at its height

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:36.033
in the third century.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:41.000
It doesn't have northwestern
Europe, but it has most of the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.500
Mediterranean.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.167
And to the degree that the Roman
Empire was, as we with

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:49.400
fatiguing repetition have said,
a Mediterranean-centered

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.533
empire, this empire of
Justinian's does a good job of

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:59.133
restoring that Mediterranean
orientation.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:06.633
If you look at the second map
during this period of what the

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:09.067
author of this book that I took
the map from, Haldon,

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:13.600
H-A-L-D-O-N, calls "the process
of devastation", you

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.567
can see how much has been lost.
The Empire at this point

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:24.633
consists mostly of Anatolia,
a little bit of

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:26.933
Italy, a few islands.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:33.433
Even the Balkans is mostly
occupied by Slavs and Bulgars.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:39.500
There then follows a period
of reconstruction, of the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.200
stabilization of borders, of
taking back some lands in the

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.433
Balkans and in Anatolia from the
Arabs in Anatolia and from

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.233
various groups in the Balkans.

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:57.167
This is also the period of the
iconoclastic emperors.

00:05:57.167 --> 00:06:03.267
And then finally, an expansion
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:07.767
The golden age of the Byzantine
Empire is this

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:12.333
period after the settlement of
Iconoclasm in 843, until the

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:15.667
appearance of a new enemy, the
Seljuk Turks, who won a

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:23.233
devastating victory in 1071 and
begin a process of what

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:24.000
ultimately--

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.633
but, in this case, ultimately
means 350 years-- what

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:31.000
ultimately would be the final
crisis for the Byzantine

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.533
Empire, which would
be extinguished by

00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:34.600
the Turks in 1453.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.667
So if you look at map number
three, the Byzantine Empire

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:44.400
around the year 1000--

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.067
Ignore Bulgaria for the time
being; that is a separate

00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:49.133
kingdom, and we're going
to talk about it soon.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:57.733
This is a compact empire
compared to that of Justinian.

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:01.900
It is not in control of
the Mediterranean.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.033
It has two bases, really, the
Balkans and Asia Minor.

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:13.067
And it has a little bit of
territory in Italy still.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:20.133
But this empire made logistic
sense, was never

00:07:20.133 --> 00:07:22.567
easy to keep together.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:27.433
Nevertheless, it was stable,
had enough money for its

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:31.867
substantial military expenses,
and even to create a kind of

00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:34.767
cultural efflorescence.

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.867
So here we have a story not
merely of survival, but of

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:42.500
survival, adaptation,
and expansion.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.333
And that's what I want to
discuss with you today.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.767
The reason we're doing this is
because this is part of early

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:50.567
medieval history.

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:55.567
We've talked about the legacy
of the Roman Empire, a

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:59.467
three-part kind of legacy
in our formulation.

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:02.433
On Wednesday, we'll start
talking again about Europe,

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:05.033
northern Europe and the degree
to which Charlemagne in

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:09.767
particular it is a
self-conscious heir to the

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:10.467
Roman Empire.

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:13.567
He revised the title
of Roman Emperor.

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:16.100
In the case of the East, these
people have never abandoned

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.800
the title of Roman Emperor.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.433
And indeed, the key thing about
the Byzantine crisis in

00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:23.667
contrast to the crisis of
the West is that the

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.067
Empire never falls.

00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:28.067
It is never destroyed.

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:34.700
But it does undergo many
of the same crises and

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.900
consequences of the crises
that the West did

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.067
in the fifth century.

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:43.567
I said last time that to some
extent, while we don't like

00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:50.567
the term "Dark Ages", certainly
after the collapse

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:53.033
of the Western Roman Empire in
the fifth century, Europe

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.367
enters into a period
of radical material

00:08:56.367 --> 00:09:00.800
simplification: That is to
say, it is more rural.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.467
There's less commerce.

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:06.733
It is politically more
decentralized.

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:07.967
It is militarized.

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:16.767
And its culture is the preserve
of a relatively small

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:19.800
group of clergy.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.900
A lot of the same things happen
in the Byzantine Empire

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.867
in the seventh and
eighth centuries.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:32.100
This is a kind of dark
age for Byzantium.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.733
We don't have a lot of written
sources, for example.

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:39.867
There seems to be an almost
complete desertion of the

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:45.067
ancient cities, with the
exception of Constantinople

00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:48.967
itself and one or two others,
the same kind of ruralization

00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:49.967
of society.

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:53.167
It is a militarized society,
although as we'll see, with

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:55.767
more central governmental
role.

00:09:55.767 --> 00:10:00.467
But it is a society built
around warfare.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:05.733
And it is a society in which
culture is also somewhat

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:07.533
restricted.

00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:11.267
The libraries don't get
destroyed exactly, but they

00:10:11.267 --> 00:10:14.767
certainly don't get a whole lot
of use, at least in terms

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:18.100
of things that we can understand
or follow.

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:27.767
And the Byzantine Empire faced
an awful lot of enemies.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:31.567
The history of Byzantium is to
some extent the history of

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:34.900
emperors you've never heard of,
writers you've never heard

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.000
of, a lot of really neat art,
heresies that you may have

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.867
never heard of before but you
have to learn anyway, and

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:49.733
invaders, some of whom you've
heard of, some of whom not.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:52.100
But heresies and invaders
are really the story.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.933
I didn't make this history,
but it is very important.

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:03.933
And actually, I think heresies
are kind of neat, although who

00:11:03.933 --> 00:11:06.400
am I to say since I went
into this for a living?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.200
So I must've liked them.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.900
The most dramatic enemy of
Byzantium in this period is

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.833
Caliphate, the Arab
empire of Islam.

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:24.067
And so in terms of the shocks
and crises of this period of

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:28.833
contraction after Justinian,
the rise of Islam, and in

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:33.033
particular the two dramatic
sieges of Constantinople in

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:40.300
674, where a naval battle
finally defeated the Arab

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.133
forces, and the siege of 717.

00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:47.800
So 674, 717, two sieges of

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.367
Constantinople by the Caliphate.

00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:03.400
So what was the problem of
imperial overreach--

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.267
just to take this back
to its origins?

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:10.133
Justinian in particular, as we
said, was focused on the

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:14.500
conquest of the Western Roman
Empire, which he saw, of

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.967
course, not as a conquest but as
a reconquest, a restoration

00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:23.967
of territories taken unjustly by
barbarian rulers, which he

00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:26.600
was determined to take back.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.100
He already had one enemy,
however, and that was Persia

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.367
on the eastern front.

00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:33.667
This is nothing new.

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:39.300
We started the course with the
Rhine and Danube frontier as

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.233
one front and the
Persian frontier

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:44.233
in the East as another.

00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:46.433
The only difference is now the
Rhine and Danube frontier has

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.700
been breached.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.000
Justinian pacified the Persians,
paid them off, made

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.867
a treaty with them in order to
have a free hand to undertake

00:12:54.867 --> 00:12:59.367
the conquests in the West.
In retrospect, with the

00:12:59.367 --> 00:13:04.567
historian's ability to
quarterback after the game,

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:09.500
the lack of attention to
Persia was a mistake.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.033
The Persians in fact invaded
despite this peace

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:15.600
treaty in the 540s.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.533
The Italian campaign
didn't go well.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:20.700
Things were patched up.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.400
Justinian died in peace.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.500
But his empire was
quite fragile.

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:31.267
In addition to everything else,
there's a plague in

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:36.867
541-542 that's kills a very
large proportion of the

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:39.400
population.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.600
And as I said, after Justinian's
death in 568, the

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.867
Lombards invade Italy.

00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:49.300
And beginning just a few years
later, in the 570s, we start

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.900
to have another force
that's a little more

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.167
difficult to describe.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:58.467
Just in the manner of the
convenient term "Lombards" we

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:00.400
don't really know what
"Lombards" means.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.267
We don't really know who
these people are.

00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:04.000
I mean, we know a
bit about them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.067
But it's a pseudo-ethnic name.

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:10.233
We don't really know how people
identified themselves.

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:13.500
But it becomes even more
confusing with the groups that

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.467
invaded the Balkans.

00:14:15.467 --> 00:14:19.167
The conventional way of
describing these is that the

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:24.600
leaders were a group called
the "Avars" and their

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.467
subordinates, their sort of cast
of thousands, their slave

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:31.400
armies, whatever you want to
call them, were "Slavs".

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.433
The Avars are a Turkic
or Mongol people.

00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:44.167
The Slavs are Indo-European
Slavs.

00:14:44.167 --> 00:14:48.200
This is to some extent how the
Slavs get into the Balkans.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.600
How this worked, relations
between the Slavs and the

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.900
Avars, is not completely
clear.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.967
But we certainly know that they
took over much of the

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.933
Balkans, including Greece.

00:15:04.933 --> 00:15:06.267
Greece in this case has to be

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:09.033
considered part of the Balkans.

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:14.333
So the southeastern corner
of Europe, modern Greece,

00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:21.700
Bulgaria, European Turkey,
Albania, Croatia, Serbia,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:31.333
Kosovo, Bosnia, Herzegovina, all
of these countries are a

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.000
heartland of the Byzantine
Empire in its post-Justinianic

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.967
form, but now invaded by Avars
and Slavs beginning in 570.

00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:46.033
The emperor Maurice was murdered
by his troops in 602,

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:49.400
campaigning in the Balkans
against the Avars and the

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.200
Slavs. He was succeeded by a
cruel but hapless general

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.633
named Phocas, whose disastrous
rule as emperor involved not

00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:05.467
only the uprising or invasion
of Avars and Slavs in the

00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:12.567
Balkans, but a Persian invasion
in the East. Phocas

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:16.000
was overthrown in 610.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.233
The Persians, Avars, and Slavs
allied against Constantinople.

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:25.233
And in 626, the city was
besieged from both sides.

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:30.967
The Persians camped out across
the Bosphorus in the end of

00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:31.967
Asiatic Turkey.

00:16:31.967 --> 00:16:35.500
And the Avars and the Slavs
camped out outside the great

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.900
Theodosian Walls of the city
that were on its land side,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.967
its western side.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:46.700
The fact that the city managed
to overcome this was

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.900
attributed to various miracles
of saints, and particularly

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.767
the protection of
the Virgin Mary.

00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:53.933
And it's very important in terms
of the later history of

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:57.800
iconoclasm to point out that
they had icons and all sorts

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.600
of wonder-working portrayals
of powerful saints on the

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.433
walls in order to protect
the city.

00:17:05.433 --> 00:17:07.733
And it worked--

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:10.233
or at least certainly it
looked like it worked.

00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:12.933
The invasions were foiled.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:15.767
How did the Byzantine
Empire fight?

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:20.667
How did manage to withstand
these invasions?

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:24.067
Very briefly, one factor is
the strategic position of

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:27.033
Constantinople, a
city extremely

00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:29.667
difficult to take by force.

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:33.667
Indeed, it would not be taken
by a flat-out assault until

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:39.767
1204, when Western crusaders,
an alliance of the Venetians

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:43.267
and the Franks, as
they're called--

00:17:43.267 --> 00:17:46.600
basically various Western
European groups--

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.533
took Constantinople.

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:51.800
How they took Constantinople;
why they didn't go to

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.567
Jerusalem, which was the
original plan; how they took a

00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:58.067
Christian city instead of the
Muslim-held city of Jerusalem

00:17:58.067 --> 00:18:01.800
is a topic for the
next semester.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.067
But that is the first
time that the walls

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:08.833
were breached by force.

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:11.567
There are very successful
sneak attacks.

00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:20.567
So for example, in our period,
the emperor Justinian II had

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:26.800
been deposed and had his
nose and tongue slit.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.900
This form of mutilation
was to prevent him

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.100
from coming back again.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.967
It was considered more humane
to mutilate someone than to

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:34.667
kill them, but the
mutilation was

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.767
considered to be disabling.

00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:42.067
You can't have an emperor whose
nose is basically gone.

00:18:42.067 --> 00:18:43.600
But they were wrong about him.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.467
In fact, he came back with a
force of people from-- if you

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:51.833
look at that third map--

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:54.533
Chersonesos, the Crimean
peninsula that's sticking out

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.200
into the Black Sea.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.867
They besieged the city, and he
and some followers snuck in at

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:05.300
a point where one of the
aqueducts met the wall.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.033
There was a little sort
of space to sneak in.

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:15.200
And they managed to, by a
surprise attack and by

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.567
acclamation of the noseless
Emperor Justinian, win the

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:21.600
city for themselves.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.833
So this is an example of a
successful siege, but not a

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:28.900
flat-out open assault.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.367
Justinian had a reign of terror
for another six or

00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:36.200
seven years after 705, the
date of the siege.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.067
He was a very angry man.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:41.133
And he got his revenge on as
many people as possible,

00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:43.600
including people who had
nothing to do with his

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.167
mutilation.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:46.267
And he was eventually killed.

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:49.400
An awful lot of these emperors
died violent deaths.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.100
They're they're tough guys, but
it's a fairly tough time.

00:19:57.267 --> 00:20:03.933
So Persian/Avar/Slav siege of
626, the seeming victory of

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:08.767
Heraclius over these forces, and
then its virtual undoing

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:14.667
by the Islamic conquests of much
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:18.500
Remember, the conquest of
Syria in the 630s, the

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.400
capitulation of Alexandria
in 642?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.900
We looked at all of these from
the Muslim side very recently.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.467
Meanwhile, while Byzantine was
busy losing much of its empire

00:20:32.467 --> 00:20:36.400
in the East, the Slavs were
permanently settling in the

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.067
Balkans and in Greece.

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:40.300
And they were now joined
by another

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.933
invading people, the Bulgars.

00:20:42.933 --> 00:20:44.267
The Bulgars--

00:20:44.267 --> 00:20:46.867
that is, the people who
live in Bulgaria now--

00:20:46.867 --> 00:20:48.800
are a Slavic people.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.733
But the original Bulgars were
a more Turkic people who

00:20:52.733 --> 00:20:56.300
formed a kind of what
was called khanate--

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:05.200
that is, a state ruled by a
military leader, a khan.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.067
But here again, who are the
Bulgars ethnically?

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.933
How many of them have
Slavic followers?

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.533
It's both very controversial--

00:21:16.533 --> 00:21:20.767
that is, the modern Bulgarians
hate the notion of being

00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:23.833
thought of as ancestrally Turks,
so what I'm saying is

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:27.367
heresy in some quarters.

00:21:27.367 --> 00:21:30.033
But these ethnic designations
are not as meaningful, or at

00:21:30.033 --> 00:21:34.800
least as stable, as we often
tend to think they are.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.967
The Bulgars would intermarry
with the Slavs. And they would

00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:41.200
eventually convert
to Orthodoxy.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.333
But they would be a problem for
Byzantium from about 700

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:52.833
until just after 1000.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:56.667
So how was this empire
rebuilt?

00:21:56.667 --> 00:22:00.233
It was rebuilt on the basis
of control over

00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:01.900
the Balkans and Anatolia.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.100
It was also rebuilt
on the basis of

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.633
reorganization of the army.

00:22:06.633 --> 00:22:10.367
Obviously, the position of
Constantinople and its walls

00:22:10.367 --> 00:22:14.400
is not enough to assure victory
in battle once you get

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.200
away from Constantinople.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.433
There's certain kinds of
weapons that they had.

00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:21.600
There's this mysterious one that
I mentioned before called

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.633
"Greek fire", which is certainly
part of the victory

00:22:24.633 --> 00:22:27.900
of 674, the naval battle
against the Caliphs.

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:38.000
It's a some sort of burning
substance that explodes on

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.200
impact and is useful
to burn ships.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.067
But the army is reorganized.

00:22:47.067 --> 00:22:51.867
And this is one of the key
aspects of this period of

00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:54.967
contraction and of
reconstruction, of crisis and

00:22:54.967 --> 00:22:59.300
of recovery.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.033
And we'll come to that
in a moment.

00:23:02.033 --> 00:23:05.833
During this era of crisis, it
should not be thought that

00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:07.900
they didn't have time for
religious controversies.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.067
In the seventh century, the big
controversies continued to

00:23:14.067 --> 00:23:19.767
be those related to the natures
of Christ. Even though

00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:24.367
the territories that were
Monophysite had been taken by

00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:29.267
Islam, or at least the most
Monophsite territories, there

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:33.300
still are controversies trying
to compromise this question of

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.167
does Christ have one or two
natures, how, if he has two

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:39.833
natures, are these
two related?

00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:45.167
Rather than saying he has two
natures, the emperors proposed

00:23:45.167 --> 00:23:47.467
two possible solutions.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.933
Christ is both God and human,
but he's got one energy,

00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:58.367
Mono-energism.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:11.467
Well maybe he's both God and
man, but he's got one will,

00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:12.733
Monothelitism.

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:28.800
The emperors in the seventh
century tried to impose

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.367
Monothelitism, or tried to
impose Monotheletism and then

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:38.600
prohibit discussion, or just
prohibit discussion about it.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:51.167
The Papacy was adamant
in upholding the two

00:24:51.167 --> 00:24:52.533
natures, one person.

00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:54.633
And this eventually won.

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:58.400
But a huge amount of energy
was expended in this

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.367
controversy.

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:03.667
And in the eighth and early
ninth centuries, we then have

00:25:03.667 --> 00:25:08.333
Iconoclasm, which as we've
spoken about, is the

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:12.000
prohibition on the
worship of icons.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Icons, again, are a form of
religious art that remains

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.733
characteristic of the
Eastern Church.

00:25:20.733 --> 00:25:24.333
And the difference between
icons and other forms of

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:27.367
religious art is that
they're portable.

00:25:27.367 --> 00:25:30.133
You can carry them around.

00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:33.833
And they are non-narrative.

00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:35.833
They don't tell a story.

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:41.200
So an icon doesn't have a
depiction of the Annunciation

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.133
or a depiction of events.

00:25:44.133 --> 00:25:47.767
They don't come in series,
showing, for example, the life

00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:52.633
of a saint or the life
of the Virgin.

00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:55.233
They are a single depiction.

00:25:58.033 --> 00:26:00.267
The iconoclasts were
worried about this

00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:02.467
as a form of idolatry.

00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:07.733
We're not sure where this
concern came from.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.167
There is no evidence that it
comes directly as a reaction

00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:15.300
to Islamic or Jewish criticism,
although of course

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.000
Islam and Judaism patrol the
frontier against idol worship

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.067
or image worship much more
severely than does

00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:25.300
Christianity.

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:29.933
It does seem to be a reaction
to the crisis.

00:26:29.933 --> 00:26:35.733
It does seem to be part of an
effort to remake Byzantium

00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:41.267
into what I guess now would be
called a leaner, more adroit,

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:47.000
responsive, or that obnoxious
business word, now, "robust",

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.900
a robust response to the crisis
imposed by Islam.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.033
Certainly it has something
to do with that.

00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:01.567
But what it really shows
us is the role of

00:27:01.567 --> 00:27:06.567
the emperor in religion.

00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:11.133
The role of the secular ruler
in the West is not as

00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:16.467
extensive, even as we will see
soon under Charlemagne.

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:20.900
Remember Chlothar and his
attempts to dictate religious

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.167
doctrine to Gregory of Tours,
who, scared though he is of

00:27:24.167 --> 00:27:27.667
Chlothar, basically
laughs at him?

00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:31.833
That shows a ruler who does not
really have control, at

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:34.933
least over the doctrine of his
church, even if he's got a lot

00:27:34.933 --> 00:27:37.833
of control over the wealth
of the Church.

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:43.767
The Western tradition would tend
to separate out ruler of

00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:47.133
the state and ruler
of doctrine.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:50.033
The East less so.

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:54.600
This is partly just the
way the Patriarch of

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.767
Constantinople is situated.

00:27:56.767 --> 00:28:00.733
He's right next to the palace of
the emperor, and so can be

00:28:00.733 --> 00:28:04.500
intimidated by the emperor.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.933
It is in the tradition of the
Orthodox Church that there is

00:28:08.933 --> 00:28:11.900
less resistance to state
authority on the part of the

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:18.000
Church, more collaboration with
state authority, and less

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.267
controversy.

00:28:20.267 --> 00:28:24.300
This is the way it's normally
taught, is that the emperor

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.667
functions kind of like the Pope
in the West. The emperor

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.600
defines doctrine.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.133
But actually, however much
deference is paid to the

00:28:34.133 --> 00:28:38.867
emperor, and however much the
emperor tries to define

00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:43.033
doctrine, the real story,
certainly for our period, is

00:28:43.033 --> 00:28:45.867
of the lack of success
of the emperors.

00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:51.867
The emperors constantly come
down on the wrong side or come

00:28:51.867 --> 00:28:55.733
up with compromises or doctrines
that don't work.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.967
They propose what in a sense
seems like a rational

00:29:02.967 --> 00:29:05.767
compromise over Monophysitism,
but theology

00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:06.867
doesn't work that way.

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:09.300
Just because you come up with
a compromise doesn't mean

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.067
everybody's going
to accept it.

00:29:11.067 --> 00:29:16.467
In fact, often compromises mean
that nobody accepts it.

00:29:16.467 --> 00:29:22.067
It's not like a negotiation
over political trade-offs.

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:25.933
This is a theological truth.

00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:28.067
So the emperors then
create their

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:29.967
own theological position.

00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:34.800
Iconoclasm is very much
an imperial demand.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.267
And for a time, they succeed
in imposing it.

00:29:37.267 --> 00:29:41.133
They succeed in imposing it
for 120 years, off and on.

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:43.333
Sometimes there will be an
emperor who is a moderate

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:46.900
iconoclast, but lets the
icons come back.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.300
Sometimes there's an emperor's
who's a moderate iconodule or

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.567
iconophile.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.500
But the emperors, even in the
East, even where the emperor

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.700
is so heavily involved in
religion, have limitations on

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.400
their ability to define
doctrine.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.267
Nevertheless, clearly, they are
the leaders of a besieged

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:14.900
people who sees itself both as
Christians against pagans or

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:22.400
Muslims, or at least infidels,
and as a religious people and

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.800
as a secular population.

00:30:30.733 --> 00:30:38.900
So with all of these crises,
sieges, invaders, how did the

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.133
Empire survive?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.400
We can see some of the plans
of the emperors.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.333
One plan was simply to get out
of Constantinople and rebuild

00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:55.533
a kind of Western empire based
in the West. So Constans II--

00:30:55.533 --> 00:30:59.333
you'll remember I
said in 661--

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:03.300
moved his capital to
Syracuse in Sicily.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.833
This was intended in part to
guard the possessions in Italy

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:10.800
and in part to hold
onto North Africa.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.367
Constans was murdered
in his bath in 668.

00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:17.933
The capitol was moved back to
Constantinople, and within

00:31:17.933 --> 00:31:20.333
thirty years, all of
North Africa had

00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:22.367
been lost to the Arabs.

00:31:22.367 --> 00:31:27.500
And you start to get the shape
of the Empire to resemble that

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.567
of the map that we looked
at last, that of 1000, a

00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:32.600
Balkan/Anatolian empire.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.400
Constans is very important,
though, even though his plans

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.733
come to naught.

00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:43.100
Because it seems to be
under his reign--

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.500
not exclusively, but very
much forwarded by him--

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.967
that two things develop
that are crucial

00:31:49.967 --> 00:31:52.233
for Byzantine success.

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:56.900
One is the practice of deporting
whole peoples and

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.367
settling them on new lands.

00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:01.633
This extremely brutal
practice--

00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:05.333
you can imagine what it's
like at any time.

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:09.367
Of course, this is practiced
a considerable amount, for

00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:12.067
example, in the former Soviet
Union, where you just tell

00:32:12.067 --> 00:32:13.567
people to get up and you're
going to move

00:32:13.567 --> 00:32:15.400
them 2,000 miles away.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.167
They're going to have better

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.233
opportunities there or whatever.

00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:20.500
But in the meantime, some of
them are going to starve.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.200
Many of them are going
to fall to disease.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.767
This is a brutal kind of
transporting of peoples,

00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:30.167
manipulation of peoples from
one area to another.

00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:33.500
The peoples manipulated in this
case were often Slavic

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:39.367
prisoners or groups taken over
as the Empire expanded, and

00:32:39.367 --> 00:32:44.167
often sent to Anatolia to
resettle lands that had been

00:32:44.167 --> 00:32:47.100
deserted in the Arab invasions
and now seized

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.333
back from the Arabs.

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:53.400
This policy, against what one
might expect, actually seems

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.333
to work, to the extent that it
does increase the population

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:05.733
of these key frontier regions
in the East with militarized

00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:12.100
forces transported
from the Balkans.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:17.467
Related to this is the
organization of the army by

00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:23.100
locality instead of as a mobile
and very large force.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.467
And this is related to the
problems of paying the army.

00:33:27.467 --> 00:33:30.567
As far back as the beginning of
the course, we said that a

00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:34.600
lot of imperial policy, just
as it's true of the state

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.733
today, is dictated by the
need to pay for troops.

00:33:38.733 --> 00:33:42.367
The most expensive thing that
most states, including the

00:33:42.367 --> 00:33:48.967
United States, does is maintain
an army and use it.

00:33:48.967 --> 00:33:51.367
For a number of reasons, this is
just a very, very expensive

00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:56.200
thing, and clearly a necessary
thing, something that is not

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.867
easy to dispense with.

00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:04.433
Diocletian's reforms indeed, the
whole restructuring of the

00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:07.567
Empire in the late third century
and early fourth

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:10.533
century was oriented
around increasing

00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:11.867
the size of the army--

00:34:11.867 --> 00:34:13.300
basically, doubling it--

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.367
and figuring out a tax
regime to pay for it.

00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:22.967
This no longer works in the
post-Justinianic world, in the

00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:28.233
crucial era here and beyond.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:29.867
Because the state does
not have enough

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:30.933
money to pay these.

00:34:30.933 --> 00:34:33.000
It does not have a tax base.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
It cannot raise the money for a
large army to operate in the

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.200
Balkans and to oppose the Arabs
without the tax revenues

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.167
from its richest province,
Egypt, and from other very

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:50.633
wealthy and important provinces
such as Syria.

00:34:50.633 --> 00:34:54.733
How, then is, it going to
have an army at all?

00:34:54.733 --> 00:35:01.833
To some extent, it is going to
do this by creating local

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:08.200
armies paid for not so much
money as by kind--

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.133
that is to say, grain, leather,
weapons, and things

00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:17.967
manufactured locally, harvested
locally, and that

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:20.500
stay locally.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.233
This is the so-called
theme system.

00:35:24.233 --> 00:35:28.567
And Wickham doesn't talk too
much about it because

00:35:28.567 --> 00:35:32.400
historians are in the process
of drawing back from this.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.600
This is one of those frustrating
things about

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.767
progress in history.

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.867
A lot of progress in history
is the dismantling of

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:42.567
convenient kinds of formulae.

00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:45.700
So when I started teaching
this, the themes were

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.167
everything.

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:48.800
I would have spent sixty
percent of this lecture

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.633
talking about the theme
situation and how it saved the

00:35:52.633 --> 00:35:54.467
Byzantine Empire.

00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:59.033
The themes look like soldiers
who are peasants.

00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:03.400
In other words, to some extent
the deal that's offered to

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.967
these troops is, we will give
you land, and we will allow

00:36:06.967 --> 00:36:10.200
you to keep most of what you
produce, rather than paying it

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.533
as tribute to a landlord.

00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:13.333
But you've got to be willing
to fight for it.

00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:15.267
You've got to owe military
service.

00:36:15.267 --> 00:36:17.300
You've got to be ready
for military service.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.500
And indeed, the land was often
in places that were dangerous,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.567
places that were liable
to invasion.

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:30.300
This is to some extent true,
but it's a little less of a

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.900
kind of Homestead Act deal.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.133
If you look at the map number
three, the year 1000--

00:36:38.133 --> 00:36:42.300
see the things that are in
italic capitals like Opsikion,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.500
Armeniakon, Anatolikon?

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.633
These are themes.

00:36:47.633 --> 00:36:51.800
They are large agglomerations
of provinces.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.033
They are what might be called
"military provinces".

00:36:55.033 --> 00:37:00.533
And as such, they combine
civilian and military rule.

00:37:00.533 --> 00:37:04.100
The Empire is now divided
into military provinces.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.867
Nothing terribly new about that,
even though the shape

00:37:06.867 --> 00:37:08.467
and the size is different.

00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:12.367
What's new is that, rather than
the revenue being raised

00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:15.767
in cash from taxes paid all
over the Empire, and then

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:19.167
transported to Constantinople,
and then disbursed to

00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:24.300
mercenaries or to standing
armies, the money that's

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.833
raised in the Opsikion tends
to stay in the Opsikion.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:34.533
These provinces tend to be
responsible for their soldiers

00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:37.400
and for paying their soldiers.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.500
The state is very heavily
involved.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.667
This is not a militia in the
sense of a bunch of trusty

00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:45.633
guys getting their muskets
or whatever they

00:37:45.633 --> 00:37:47.533
used off the wall.

00:37:47.533 --> 00:37:50.433
This is not Paul Revere,
or something like that.

00:37:50.433 --> 00:37:57.933
But it is an army that is closer
to the population and

00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:03.167
in which the male population
is largely involved in the

00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:05.367
military forces.

00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:08.033
Another word that I don't
particularly care for in its

00:38:08.033 --> 00:38:10.233
modern use" "stakeholder".

00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:12.800
They're stakeholders in the
sense that it makes a big

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.767
difference to them.

00:38:13.767 --> 00:38:16.567
They're not just civilians
in this case.

00:38:16.567 --> 00:38:20.467
This is, then, a militarization
of society.

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:25.733
It is a new way of paying for
things in an economy that is

00:38:25.733 --> 00:38:34.333
less productive of revenues, at
least of taxable revenues.

00:38:34.333 --> 00:38:39.500
And it is, above all, whatever
its exact nature, an

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.867
innovation that works.

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:48.000
The basis for this expansion
that takes place after 843,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.100
and indeed for the stabilization
of the frontiers

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.000
that proceeds it is a
reorganization of the army,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.133
the theme system, a
reorganization of revenues,

00:39:00.133 --> 00:39:05.500
and a kind of strategic plan to
define the Byzantine Empire

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:10.467
in a way that is ultimately
feasible and defensible.

00:39:13.033 --> 00:39:18.067
From 717 to 843, the Empire
recovers slowly.

00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:20.967
We choose 843 because that's
the end of the iconoclast

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.267
controversy.

00:39:23.267 --> 00:39:26.300
The Empire continued to have
to fight on both fronts

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.900
against the Arabs
and the Bulgars.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.433
But it had a viable state, a
viable military structure, and

00:39:33.433 --> 00:39:36.867
some capable emperors.

00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:42.233
After 843, we see a real
rebirth and expansion.

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:49.033
From 843 to 1000, the Empire
grew by about one third.

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:52.800
Even though that map, the third
one, for the year 1000,

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.700
doesn't seem very imposing, if
you take a look at it, you'll

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:02.400
see that its frontiers with
Islam are much more secure

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.167
than they have been before.

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:10.233
The Empire extends eastward as
far as Armenia, for a long

00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:18.067
time a frontier province, and it
is on the borders of Syria.

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.667
It has the great city
of Antioch again.

00:40:20.667 --> 00:40:22.733
It has all of Anatolia.

00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:25.767
It has the islands of Cyprus
and Crete, which had been

00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:29.567
occupied by Islamic
forces for years.

00:40:29.567 --> 00:40:35.000
It has control over all of
modern Greece and has held

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.867
onto some possessions
in Italy.

00:40:38.867 --> 00:40:43.133
This is an era of great
splendor, ceremony, the

00:40:43.133 --> 00:40:45.500
restoration of education,
and of learning.

00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:56.333
The Bulgars will be defeated
definitively by 1019.

00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:59.567
Constantinople would be besieged
by them twice.

00:40:59.567 --> 00:41:02.167
You can't have a century without
a couple of sieges of

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:04.867
Constantinople.

00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:08.500
The Abbasids are defeated, and
the expansion of the Byzantine

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.400
Empire, as you see, as far south
as modern Lebanon and as

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.167
far east as modern Armenia--

00:41:16.167 --> 00:41:17.400
well, historic Armenia.

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:30.067
This is a society that is still
involved in religious

00:41:30.067 --> 00:41:32.533
controversy.

00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:34.067
This is--

00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:38.767
in the ninth century with the
Carolingians, there would be a

00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:44.367
controversy over the holy ghost
in relation to the son

00:41:44.367 --> 00:41:46.733
and the father, the so-called
"filioque controversy".

00:41:50.267 --> 00:41:59.800
But it is a world of great
energy: artistic, cultural,

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.267
and actually religious.

00:42:02.267 --> 00:42:05.167
Perhaps the most lasting and
significant accomplishment of

00:42:05.167 --> 00:42:08.367
this era is the conversion of
the Slavs and the conversion

00:42:08.367 --> 00:42:10.433
of much of Eastern Europe--

00:42:15.167 --> 00:42:18.800
conversion to what would become
the Orthodox as opposed

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.067
to Catholic form of
Christianity.

00:42:22.067 --> 00:42:24.733
The official split between the
Orthodox world and the

00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:28.000
Catholic world won't
occur until 1054.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.567
In 1054, the Patriarch of
Constantinople excommunicated

00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:34.200
the Pope and the Pope
excommunicated the Patriarch

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.367
of Constantinople.

00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:38.800
I think they've taken it back,
but obviously the churches are

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.067
not joined.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.733
They have differences already,
however, that are visible in

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:48.400
the ninth and tenth centuries.

00:42:51.433 --> 00:42:56.100
Orthodoxy is less politically
centralized.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.867
If, as we just said, it's very
dependent on the ruler, if the

00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:02.167
ruler is different, then
the Church has a

00:43:02.167 --> 00:43:04.367
sort of national identity.

00:43:04.367 --> 00:43:08.400
Thus, there is no Pope in
the Orthodox Church.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:16.767
The Bulgarian Orthodox, Greek
Orthodox, Russian Orthodox

00:43:16.767 --> 00:43:19.900
essentially form a confederation
under their own

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.900
patriarchs.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.267
They also have their
own languages.

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:27.100
The Bible could be translated
into vernacular, and the

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:33.167
liturgy was not in one
language necessarily.

00:43:33.167 --> 00:43:38.233
So Slavonic, the ancestor of
modern Slavic languages, would

00:43:38.233 --> 00:43:40.467
be instituted as the
liturgy in many of

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:43.167
these converted places.

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:46.133
Priests are allowed to marry
in the Orthodox Church.

00:43:50.267 --> 00:43:53.033
There were just, sort of,
questions of style.

00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:56.267
For example, the Orthodox
Church, even when it has

00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:59.900
admitted icons back, does not
have statues, does not have

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.733
three-dimensional statues,
whereas the Catholic world, of

00:44:02.733 --> 00:44:03.633
course, does.

00:44:03.633 --> 00:44:10.267
Think of Notre Dame of Paris and
its sculptural program or

00:44:10.267 --> 00:44:17.233
Chartres or the Michelangelo and
Bernini sacred sculptures.

00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:19.967
This is partly because, while
icons are OK because they're

00:44:19.967 --> 00:44:23.033
two-dimensional, statues were
thought of as being too much

00:44:23.033 --> 00:44:24.800
like the idols denounced
again and

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.167
again by the Old Testament.

00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:30.767
Greek Orthodox priests
have beards;

00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:32.000
Catholic priests don't.

00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:40.600
They're different styles
of worship.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.467
In Orthodox churches, you stand;
there aren't seats.

00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:50.600
Some of this is style.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.800
Some of this is theology.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.200
Some of this is just culture.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.133
But of course, this would be
in the ninth century and

00:44:57.133 --> 00:45:00.067
remain a very strong
difference.

00:45:00.067 --> 00:45:03.533
So you can see that those
countries converted by the

00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:09.400
Catholics have a Latin liturgy
and a Western or Latin or

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.000
Roman orientation.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.267
Poland is Catholic.

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:16.967
Russia, on the other hand,
would be converted to

00:45:16.967 --> 00:45:19.300
Byzantine Christianity.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.967
The division is clear and
unfortunately tragic in the

00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:26.867
former Yugoslavia.

00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:31.367
Serbian and Croatian are almost
the same language.

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:34.667
Serbian is written in Cyrillic,
Croatian in Roman.

00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:39.667
The Croatians are Catholics;
the Serbians are Orthodox.

00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:43.367
Their hatred for each other,
and then of course the

00:45:43.367 --> 00:45:47.533
complication of having an
Islamic people, the Bosnians,

00:45:47.533 --> 00:45:53.233
was the background to the tragic
Yugoslav Civil War of

00:45:53.233 --> 00:45:55.733
the early 1990s.

00:45:55.733 --> 00:46:02.133
So these religious boundaries,
which sort of correspond to

00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:03.200
ethnic boundaries--

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.033
even though those ethnic
definitions are themselves

00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:07.867
invented, to some extent--

00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.733
these religious boundaries
continue to be very meaningful

00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:13.100
and to define culture
in Europe.

00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:21.300
The conversion of this world
is, then, one of the most

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.933
important events of the
renascent Byzantine Empire.

00:46:24.933 --> 00:46:30.600
The coronation of the king of
Russia, the king of Kievan

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.067
Russia, in 989 at Cherson on
the Crimean Peninsula,

00:46:36.067 --> 00:46:41.633
presided over by emissaries of
the Byzantine Emperor is one

00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:44.433
symbol of this.

00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:47.967
The conversion of the Bulgars.

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:54.533
The conversion of many of the
peoples of the Balkans.

00:46:54.533 --> 00:46:59.367
And indeed, there is a kind
of aftermath of Byzantine

00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:00.633
civilization.

00:47:00.633 --> 00:47:06.233
The closest heir to the Eastern
Roman Empire is the

00:47:06.233 --> 00:47:08.000
Russian Empire.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.133
The look of Orthodox worship,
the look of the Russian

00:47:13.133 --> 00:47:23.200
churches, the icons, the gold,
the imperial style is very

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.367
closely related,
self-consciously, to the model

00:47:26.367 --> 00:47:28.467
established by the Byzantine
emperors.

00:47:28.467 --> 00:47:31.500
Indeed, in the sixteenth
century, after the fall of

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:37.267
Constantinople, Russian monks
claimed that there had been

00:47:37.267 --> 00:47:39.700
three Romes.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.600
The Rome of the West, the
original one, had fallen in

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.833
the fifth century; the great
Eastern Rome, that of

00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:50.367
Constantinople, had fallen in
the fifteenth; and the third

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:53.600
Rome was Moscow.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.633
I don't think that outside of
the Russian orbit most people

00:47:58.633 --> 00:48:03.433
think of Moscow as the third
Rome for a number of reasons,

00:48:03.433 --> 00:48:08.667
whatever its power and its
own form of splendor.

00:48:08.667 --> 00:48:14.067
But the degree to which Russia
in its history is the heir to

00:48:14.067 --> 00:48:17.933
the world that we have briefly
described cannot be denied,

00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:22.067
even if to some extent it is a
self-formed or self-conscious

00:48:22.067 --> 00:48:24.467
manifestation.

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:28.933
Moving from Byzantium, on
Wednesday, we will come back

00:48:28.933 --> 00:48:35.000
to friendly old Francia and
discuss the rise and

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.900
efflorescence of the
Carolingians.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.133
Thanks.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.500
Professor Paul Bloom:
Sex is really strange.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.157
You ask people,
"What's your favorite

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:28.544
activity?"
and if you ask people,

00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:33.962
particularly college students,
particularly just fresh from

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:40.220
spring break – I've seen teen
movies – they'll often answer,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.145
"Sex."
or some word that is synonymous

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:48.886
with sex.
But there's a kind of a puzzle

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:53.470
about how much time we spend on
sex.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.410
And it turns out there is data
on this.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.345
So, people say sex is their
favorite activity,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:03.128
but it turns out we actually
know how much time the average

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:07.059
American spends on sex.
And the data I'm going to

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:12.005
follow from was summarized in
this wonderful book by James

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.046
Gleick:
Americans tell pollsters

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:17.760
their single favorite activity
is sex.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.948
In terms of enjoyability,
they rank sex ahead of sports,

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.993
fishing, bar-hopping,
hugging and kissing,

00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:28.355
talking with the family,
eating, watching television,

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.442
going on trips,
planning trips,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.780
gardening, bathing,
shopping, dressing,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.245
housework, dishwashing,
laundry, visiting the dentist,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:39.747
and getting the car repaired.
On the other hand,

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:45.206
these same studies suggested
the average time per day devoted

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:49.209
to sex is four minutes and three
seconds.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.628
[As Gleick says,]
This is not much,

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:58.260
even if the four minutes
excludes time spent flirting,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.021
dancing, ogling,
cruising the boulevard,

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.489
toning up in gyms,
toning up in beauty parlors,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.885
rehearsing pick up lines,
showering, thinking about sex,

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:11.722
reading about sex,
doodling pornographically,

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:16.027
looking at erotic magazines,
renting videos,

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:19.578
dreaming of sex,
looking at fashion magazines,

00:02:19.578 --> 00:02:22.592
cleaning up after sex,
coping with the consequences of

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:24.799
sex,
building towers or otherwise

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.030
repressing, transferring,
and sublimating .

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.271
And I like this passage because
it illustrates two points,

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:38.411
two important points.
One is we don't actually spend

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:41.696
that much time on sex.
In fact, the four minutes and

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:46.165
three seconds is an interesting
number because when you do times

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:50.278
studies on how much Americans
spend filling out tax-related

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:54.745
forms for the IRS,
it's four minutes and a few

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:57.748
seconds.
But the passage also points out

00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:00.935
that regardless of the brute
time we spend on it,

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.259
it is extraordinarily
important.

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.877
Everything in life follows from
it – marriage,

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:09.879
family, children,
much of aggression,

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.348
much of competition,
much of art and music and

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:17.166
creative pursuits.
Much of everything follows from

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.092
it.
If we were a creature without

00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:21.120
sex, everything would be
different.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.847
And what's interesting is,
there are creatures without

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:27.054
sex.
There are creatures that

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:29.547
reproduce by cloning.
And in fact,

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:32.763
this basic fact about people
– that we fall,

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:37.479
roughly, into males and females
– is an evolutionary mystery.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:42.787
It's not clear why animals that
are somewhat large have two

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:45.132
sexes.
From a biological Darwinian

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:48.774
perspective, having two sexes is
bizarre because each time you

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:51.819
have an offspring you toss away
half your genes.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.770
My children only have--each of
them have half my DNA.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.680
If I were to clone,
they would have all of it.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.650
And so, it's a puzzle how sex
ever evolved.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.586
This is not a course in
evolutionary biology,

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.360
and that's not the puzzle we're
going to be looking at today.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.009
We're going to look at a few
questions.

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.644
First, we're going to talk from
first a theoretical point of

00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:17.278
view and then an empirical point
of view about how males and

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:20.600
females are different.
Then we're going to talk about

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.640
sexual attractiveness,
some research about what people

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.766
find to be sexually attractive,
and then we'll talk a very

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.481
little bit at the end about the
origins of sexual preference:

00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:33.274
why some people are straight,
others gay, others bisexual,

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:38.147
and others harder to classify.
Now, of all the topics I'm

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:42.964
presenting, sex is one of the
sort of dicey ones from an

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:47.885
emotional point of view.
These are difficult issues

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:50.735
because sex is,
by definition,

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:56.139
an intimate part of our lives,
and it matters a lot.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.860
Moreover, sex is fraught with
moral implications.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.079
And since I'm talking about
this from, at least at the

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.420
beginning, from a Darwinian
evolutionary perspective,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.367
I'm obliged to start off by
dealing with some of the moral

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:13.000
consequences and moral
implications.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.798
So, for instance,
many biologists – all

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:21.925
biologists I would say – will
have argued that sexual

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:24.012
behavior,
sexual action,

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:25.960
sexual desire is,
to some extent,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.370
a biological adaptation
existing to spread our genes.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.901
From that perspective then,
non-procreative sex –

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:37.889
including gay sex,
sex with birth control,

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.160
sex by post-menopausal women
– does not serve this

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.528
reproductive goal and,
in some sense perhaps,

00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:50.512
is unnatural.
And one might argue then,

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:54.302
"Does this mean it's wrong?"
We'll also be talking about sex

00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:56.970
differences, differences between
men and women,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.097
for instance,
in how much you want anonymous

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:03.370
sexual encounters,
differences between men and

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.709
women in social intelligence,
in aggression and empathy.

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:11.812
And regardless of what you
think about these differences,

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:16.500
whether you think they're right
or wrong or it doesn't matter,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.030
you'll ask the question,
"To what extent are they

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.100
mutable?"
That is, if they exist through

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.914
Darwinian natural selection,
to what extent can we ever get

00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:30.250
rid of them?
And I want to address those two

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.488
issues, the issues of morality
and inevitability,

00:06:33.488 --> 00:06:36.671
from the very start.
And I want to start off

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:40.147
with--for each of them have a
quote by a prominent

00:06:40.147 --> 00:06:43.506
evolutionary scholar.
So, the first one is by Steve

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:45.620
Pinker in How the Mind
Works.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.546
And he writes, 
Nature does not dictate

00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:52.100
what we should accept or how we
should live our lives.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.352
Well into my procreating years,
I am so far voluntarily

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:59.147
childless, having squandered my
biological resources reading and

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:00.733
writing,
doing research,

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:03.209
helping friends and students,
and jogging in

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.779
circles--ignoring the solemn
imperative to spread my genes.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:09.890
By Darwinian standards,
I am a horrible mistake,

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.199
a pathetic loser,
but I am happy to be that way,

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.103
and if my genes don't like it
they can go jump in the

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.916
lake.
Pinker's point,

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:22.685
I think, is a reasonable one.
It is true that certain things

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:26.456
we do exist to serve the
dictates of natural selection,

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:28.970
but that doesn't make them
right?

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.525
If you think that something is
only right if it leads to the

00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:36.873
generation of more genes,
if it leads to reproduction,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.670
then you're not going to think
very much about birth control.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.529
You're not going to think very
much about any sort of

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.856
non-procreative sex.
On the other hand,

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:47.957
if you're--Moreover,
if you think something's wrong

00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:51.052
if it's unnatural,
you're going to think much

00:07:51.052 --> 00:07:54.983
about flying in a plane or
refrigerating food or surviving

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.446
a severe infection.
More generally,

00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:00.600
our bodies and brains have
evolved for reproductive

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.943
success, but we can use these
brains to choose our own

00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:06.577
destinies.
Nothing moral necessarily

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.939
follows from the facts of
biology.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:12.339
That's all I'm going to say
about morality.

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:15.485
But I want you to keep it in
mind when we discuss different

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:17.980
claims about what's evolved and
what hasn't.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.006
What about inevitability?
Here I want to turn to Richard

00:08:22.006 --> 00:08:24.220
Dawkins.
Richard Dawkins writes, 

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.158
If a child has had bad
teaching in mathematics,

00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:30.550
it is accepted that a resulting
deficiency can be remedied by

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.149
extra-good teaching in the
following year.

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:35.898
But any suggestion that the
child's deficiency might have a

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.362
genetic origin is likely to be
greeted with something

00:08:38.362 --> 00:08:41.007
approaching despair.
If it's in the genes,

00:08:41.007 --> 00:08:44.669
it is determined and nothing
can be done about it.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:48.460
This is pernicious nonsense on
an almost astrological scale.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.851
Genetic causes and
environmental causes are in

00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:53.029
principle no different from each
other.

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:55.899
Some may be harder to reverse,
others may be easy.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:58.987
What did genes do to deserve
their sinister,

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:02.718
juggernaut-like reputation?
Why are genes thought to be so

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:05.576
much more fixed and inescapable
in their effects than

00:09:05.576 --> 00:09:09.519
television, nuns or books.
I like the nuns.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:16.482
And the point here is what
causes something is logically

00:09:16.482 --> 00:09:21.039
separate from what can reverse
it.

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:25.124
And you can think of clear
cases where something is plainly

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:29.280
genetic but is fairly easily
reversed and where something is

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.520
cultural and is very difficult
to reverse.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.519
Here's an example.
My eyesight is quite poor.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:40.630
The reason why my eyesight is
quite poor is not due to the

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.019
patriarchy, television,
culture or "the man."

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:48.343
Rather, my eyesight is quite
poor due to the crappy genes Mom

00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:50.879
and Dad gave me.
It is genetically determined if

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.940
anything is.
It is also fairly easy to fix.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.303
There are these machines where
they put panes of glass in front

00:09:58.303 --> 00:10:01.259
of your eyes and help you to see
better.

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:04.301
More advanced machines known as
contact lenses actually stick

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:07.822
the thing into your eyes,
and at the cost of occasional

00:10:07.822 --> 00:10:10.419
infections you come to see
better.

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:15.370
It's biologically caused but
fairly easy to fix.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.525
On the other hand,
take an example of society's

00:10:18.525 --> 00:10:21.971
treatment of the obese.
It turns out when we – and

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:25.373
we'll get to this a little bit
when we talk about sexual

00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:29.269
attractiveness – how thin
somebody is or how fat they are;

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:32.166
what you think of that is
actually not particularly

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.586
hard-wired.
It varies a lot from culture to

00:10:34.586 --> 00:10:36.809
culture.
But once it's in a culture,

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:39.000
it is almost impossible to
shake.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.218
So, the point,
there is just that genetic does

00:10:43.218 --> 00:10:47.998
not mean inevitable,
and cultural does not mean easy

00:10:47.998 --> 00:10:50.150
to fix.
Okay.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.169
That's general background.
Let's start with basic Sex Ed.

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:56.200
What's the difference between
males and females?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:02.009
Well, don't even think penis
and vagina.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:05.019
There are a lot of animals that
have neither one.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.460
And the difference actually
runs deeper.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.611
By definition,
when biologists talk about

00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:14.629
this, animals that are males
have a little sex cell,

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:19.120
which carries genes and nothing
else – sperm cells.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.471
Animals that are females have a
big sex cell,

00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:26.965
which has genes but also food
and a protective cover and all

00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:30.609
sorts of other stuff.
Typically, the little sex cell

00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:32.870
is much littler than the big sex
cell.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.100
This is the only erotic picture
I'm going to show you today.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:42.090
It's a bunch of these little
sperm circling around the egg.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:48.759
It's romantic.
But this raises a puzzle.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:51.925
I just described male and
female roughly in terms of a

00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:55.218
size difference.
Males are the smaller of the

00:11:55.218 --> 00:11:57.269
sex cells;
females are the bigger.

00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:02.082
Why is it then that for so many
animals males are the bigger

00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:06.080
ones, physically,
and the more aggressive ones.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.858
This has been a puzzle that has
occupied scientists for a long,

00:12:09.858 --> 00:12:13.315
long time.
And we're pretty--there is now

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:18.200
a pretty clear answer to it.
And the answer goes like this.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.096
It is based on an idea by
Robert Trivers called "parental

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:27.708
investment."
And what parental investment

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:31.907
is, it's defined here as,
any investment that's going to

00:12:31.907 --> 00:12:36.565
increase the offspring's chance
of survival at the cost of the

00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:40.460
parent's ability to invest in
other offspring.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.770
So, for example,
suppose an animal could create

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.304
an offspring by blinking an eye
and then the offspring would run

00:12:48.304 --> 00:12:50.937
off?
That would be extremely little

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.831
investment.
Suppose another animal had to

00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:57.045
work for ten years,
and during those ten years

00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:59.760
could not create another
offspring.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.000
That would be a huge investment.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.300
Trivers points out that within
a species, females typically

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.210
have a much higher parental
investment than males.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.616
Because females have these big
sex cells, they typically

00:13:17.616 --> 00:13:21.529
incubate them internally.
They carry them.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.769
If they're eggs,
they might have to sit on them.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:29.379
And hence, each potential child
is a huge cost.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:33.690
For males, which have the small
sex cell, you don't have the

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.245
same thing.
For males, it might just be a

00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:40.929
few moments of copulation and
that's it.

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:44.831
If you could ask yourself,
for humans, each one of you in

00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:48.941
the room, "What is the minimum
effort you can do to create a

00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:53.663
child that has half your genes?"
And it's apparent that the male

00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:57.020
investment, on average,
is lower than the female

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.052
investment.
Males can choose,

00:13:59.052 --> 00:14:02.697
or might do better off in some
circumstances by putting a lot

00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:05.855
of investment into their
offspring, but females don't

00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:09.373
have a choice.
Females, barring technological

00:14:09.373 --> 00:14:13.470
advance, have a huge investment
into any offspring;

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.450
not investment in the sense or
hard work and effort,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.305
though there's that too.
Investment in the sense that

00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:24.641
when you're--when you're
pregnant with one offspring,

00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:28.730
you can't have another.
What this does is it has

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.769
ramifications that percolate
upwards.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:37.529
So, it leads to different
psychologies.

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:41.692
Males--and a single male could
fertilize several females,

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:45.558
forcing some males to go
mate-less and giving rise to

00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:49.870
competition to see who can mate
with the most females.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.072
For females,
however, females can always

00:14:53.072 --> 00:14:56.649
find mates.
So, sheer numbers don't count.

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:00.776
But there's competition to mate
with the right males,

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:05.379
those whose offspring have the
best chance of surviving.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:09.600
The competition now explains
the puzzle we started with.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.065
It explains why males are
typically larger,

00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:15.059
and often why males have
evolved special weapons.

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:18.631
These special weapons evolved
for fighting other males for

00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:22.259
reproductive access.
It also explains something else.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:25.059
Females, biologically,
are choosy.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:30.876
And so males have to compete
not merely with other males to

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:35.889
get reproductive access but also
to woo females.

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:39.279
And so often,
males have evolved special

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:42.929
displays like this ,
which exist only to be

00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:47.970
beautiful, only to be attractive
and to attract mates.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:54.207
This cold evolutionary logic
was captured in this cartoon,

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:59.787
which really does sum up a
hundred of mate-selection

00:15:59.787 --> 00:16:01.210
research.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.249
The logic goes like this then:
difference in the size of sex

00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:11.860
cells leads to differences in
typical parental investment,

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.424
leading to differences in the
sorts of psychological and

00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:16.290
physiological mechanisms that
evolved.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.519
Okay, that's a good story.
What sort of evidence is there

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.606
for it?
Well, it turns out this could

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:24.759
explain some otherwise
surprising things.

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:27.577
For instance,
there should be--there are some

00:16:27.577 --> 00:16:30.779
cases where the parental
investment is switched,

00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:34.949
some cases where it turns
out--where the males end up with

00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:37.509
more investment than the
females.

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:43.327
And it--and the theory predicts
that in these cases you should

00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:47.173
get an asymmetry.
So, in cases like pipefish,

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.411
for instance,
the male takes the eggs into a

00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:53.800
pouch and plugs them into his
bloodstream.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.953
The females shoot off.
They have less of an investment

00:16:56.953 --> 00:16:58.633
than the males.
In this case,

00:16:58.633 --> 00:17:01.968
you would predict,
as is true, the females should

00:17:01.968 --> 00:17:05.928
be larger, the females fight
other females more than males

00:17:05.928 --> 00:17:09.035
fight males,
and the females try to compete

00:17:09.035 --> 00:17:13.929
for the attention of the males.
Recall the movie "March of the

00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:16.393
Penguins."
We saw a clip from it,

00:17:16.393 --> 00:17:20.146
and this was in the context of
discussing the emotions that

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:22.539
have evolved toward our
offspring.

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:26.579
But remember the story and how
both the male and the female

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.339
have to go to tremendous lengths
to protect the egg.

00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:34.015
And if one of them fails,
the egg dies and neither one

00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:37.011
has it.
You should then not even have

00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:41.346
to remember whether male
penguins are much bigger than

00:17:41.346 --> 00:17:44.328
female penguins.
You should realize they should

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:47.766
not be, and in fact they aren't.
They're about the same size

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:51.642
because the parental is equal.
You should be able to predict

00:17:51.642 --> 00:17:54.928
the size differences and
aggression differences based on

00:17:54.928 --> 00:17:58.545
differing parental investment.
So for instance,

00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:04.200
elephant seals are four
times--the males are enormous.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.539
They're four times bigger than
the females.

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:10.097
And this is in large part
because elephant seals compete

00:18:10.097 --> 00:18:13.380
for harems of females.
It's a "winner take all."

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.766
Gibbons are about the same size.
And this is because gibbons are

00:18:17.766 --> 00:18:20.210
pretty monogamous;
they raise children together.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.519
This illustrates something,
which is, it's not always the

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:32.660
case that male parental
investment is low.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.028
There are some species,
including gibbons,

00:18:35.028 --> 00:18:38.148
where it's in the male's
reproductive advantage to care

00:18:38.148 --> 00:18:41.018
for the offspring.
Imagine a situation,

00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:44.536
for instance,
where an offspring would die if

00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:49.572
both parents didn't watch it for
many years and where the effort

00:18:49.572 --> 00:18:53.650
devoted to that offspring had to
be exclusive.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.735
If you focused on another
family or went away,

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:57.825
the offspring would die.
In that case,

00:18:57.825 --> 00:19:01.463
you'd have equal investment.
It would matter equally to the

00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:04.124
male and the female to invest in
their offspring,

00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:08.152
and the cost would be the same.
There's no species--it's hard

00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:12.066
to see species that have that
much of an equal system,

00:19:12.066 --> 00:19:14.799
but some primates are close to
it.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:17.800
And this raises the question
then, "What about humans?"

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.446
What about us?
What do we know about the

00:19:20.446 --> 00:19:22.750
differences between males and
females?

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:30.250
Well, humans are a relatively
polygamous species.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:35.960
Most cultures--most human
cultures are polygamous.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.180
American culture is what they
call "serial monogamy."

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.260
So, we're not like some species
of birds.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.289
We don't mate for life.
We do a series of peer-bondings

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:48.579
for some period of time.
It could be for life,

00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:52.250
but indeed may not be and
usually isn't.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.063
Males are bigger than females.
Human males--the size estimates

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:58.073
vary so much,
but the average human male is

00:19:58.073 --> 00:20:01.039
about fifteen percent larger
than the average human female.

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:04.481
This suggests that there's
some--there's been,

00:20:04.481 --> 00:20:08.917
in our evolutionary history,
some male-male competition for

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.613
access to females,
which suggests,

00:20:11.613 --> 00:20:15.529
in turn, that the parental
investment is not quite equal.

00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:19.502
Males have smaller testicles
for their body size than

00:20:19.502 --> 00:20:23.323
chimpanzees, but larger
testicles than gorillas and

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:26.221
gibbons.
And this suggests that there

00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:30.607
was some intermediate amount of
competition for the capacity to

00:20:30.607 --> 00:20:33.160
create sperm.
And this is relevant for a

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.439
different sort of competition,
which regards the impregnation

00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:38.569
of females that have multiple
mates.

00:20:38.569 --> 00:20:41.907
And this suggests that over
evolutionary history women were

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.554
not wantonly promiscuous,
but were not entirely

00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:47.924
monogamous either;
so much so that it paid from an

00:20:47.924 --> 00:20:51.727
evolutionary point of view to
evolve--males to evolve the

00:20:51.727 --> 00:20:55.190
capacity to produce more sperm
than other males.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.480
Aggression.
Males are meaner.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.490
I mean I'm summarizing here.
Meaner is not a technical term.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.888
Yes, females can be meaner,
but males are at least more

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:07.401
physically violent.
They're more violent in the

00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:10.509
womb, in utero;
they're more violent as

00:21:10.509 --> 00:21:14.130
children, and they're more
violent as adults.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:19.959
Again, this is not to say that
you can't find violent women or

00:21:19.959 --> 00:21:23.136
non-violent men.
It's just on average there is

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:25.670
this difference.
They kick more;

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:30.238
males kick more in the uterus.
As children they're more

00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:33.809
involved in play fighting and
violent combat-like sports.

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:37.201
And as adults,
wherever you go you will find a

00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:40.157
prison.
And wherever you go you will

00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:43.410
find that prison is mostly full
of men.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.779
They are far more likely to
kill one another and to harm one

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:49.679
another.
Male sex hormones,

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:52.706
like testosterone,
are not the sort of thing one

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:56.570
would want to inject in somebody
unless you want them to turn

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.777
kind of mean.
They increase aggressiveness,

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:02.460
both in humans and in other
primates.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:09.289
What about sexual choosiness?
Do male humans and female

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:16.511
humans differ in the extent to
which they will favor anonymous

00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:19.025
sex?
And this is relevant from an

00:22:19.025 --> 00:22:22.396
evolutionary perspective,
because the parental investment

00:22:22.396 --> 00:22:26.430
theory predicts males should be
more receptive to anonymous sex.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.964
Because for males,
to impregnate somebody else

00:22:30.964 --> 00:22:35.700
might fortuitously lead to
another offspring;

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.053
it might be good for you and
doesn't carry the sort of harm

00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:40.846
that females,
on the other hand,

00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:44.509
have to be very picky.
Because they have to choose

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:47.497
carefully.
Remember, these systems evolved

00:22:47.497 --> 00:22:50.759
before birth control and
vasectomies and so on.

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:52.853
So, what do we know
cross-culturally and

00:22:52.853 --> 00:22:56.710
psychologically?
Well, prostitution is a

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:02.869
universally, or near
universally, male interest.

00:23:02.869 --> 00:23:06.992
There are male prostitutes,
of course, but contrary to some

00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:11.400
various fantasies and sitcoms,
they cater to male customers.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.220
Pornography is a human
universal.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.156
In every society,
males have done some sort of

00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:23.230
depictions of naked females for
the purposes of arousal.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.390
Often they carve them into
trees or do sort of sculptures.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.061
One of the weirdest findings in
the last decade or so is that

00:23:32.061 --> 00:23:35.019
this extends as well to monkey
porn.

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:39.836
And so, some scientists at Duke
set up a situation where monkeys

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:43.488
could pay in fruit juice,
by giving up fruit juice,

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:47.299
to look a picture either of the
female's hindquarters or of a

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:50.497
celebrity monkey,
a socially dominant monkey,

00:23:50.497 --> 00:23:54.281
some sort of combination of
People Magazine and

00:23:54.281 --> 00:23:57.356
Penthouse.
And so, there's some interest

00:23:57.356 --> 00:23:59.400
in this even by non-human
primates.

00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:06.920
What about actually preference
for sexual variety?

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.190
Well, you can get at this in
different ways.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:16.078
There is what biologists
describe as the "Coolidge

00:24:16.078 --> 00:24:18.470
Effect."
I have this here.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.094
And the Coolidge Effect is
based on President Calvin

00:24:21.094 --> 00:24:23.760
Coolidge.
And it's a story about Calvin

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.453
Coolidge and his wife,
who were being shown around a

00:24:27.453 --> 00:24:30.498
farm separately.
And the person showing around

00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:33.490
his wife pointed out that there
were a lot of hens;

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.552
she noticed that there were a
lot of hens but only one

00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:38.764
rooster.
And she asked the guy showing

00:24:38.764 --> 00:24:40.849
her around, "Is one rooster
enough?"

00:24:40.849 --> 00:24:42.395
And the guys said,
"Well, you know,

00:24:42.395 --> 00:24:45.425
the rooster works very hard.
The rooster has sex dozens of

00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:46.827
times a day."
And she said,

00:24:46.827 --> 00:24:48.990
"Well, be sure to tell that to
the president."

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.791
The story goes,
the president went around,

00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:54.730
the guy tells the story to the
president.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.680
The president asks the man,
"Huh.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.510
Has sex dozens of times each
day.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.892
Same hen every time?"
The guy says,

00:25:01.892 --> 00:25:04.271
"No, different hen every time."
And he says,

00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:06.700
"Tell that to Mrs.
Coolidge."

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.397
Now, there are two responses to
this sort of story,

00:25:10.397 --> 00:25:13.059
and they're both kind of
negative.

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:15.475
One thing is,
"Well, everybody knows males

00:25:15.475 --> 00:25:17.950
prefer anonymous sex with
strange women.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.662
Duh."
The other response is,

00:25:20.662 --> 00:25:25.369
"That's sexist claptrap."
You might think--you might be a

00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:27.569
male and say,
"That's not me."

00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:30.608
You might know males and say,
"The males I know are not like

00:25:30.608 --> 00:25:32.740
that."
So, how do you find out?

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.036
Well, there are indirect
measures, such who goes to

00:25:35.036 --> 00:25:37.191
prostitutes.
But there are also fairly

00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:40.448
direct measures.
One fairly direct measure is

00:25:40.448 --> 00:25:43.869
you could ask people in
anonymous surveys.

00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:46.021
So, in fact,
I'll give you some anonymous

00:25:46.021 --> 00:25:47.740
surveys.
I'm not going to ask people.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.983
And you just ask them.
So, for instance,

00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:56.299
I want everybody to consider
this question.

00:25:56.299 --> 00:25:59.980
How many sexual partners do you
want to have in the next month?

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.460
What is it--we're coming up to
April.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.360
How many sexual partners do you
want in April?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.566
Next two years?
Take many of you through

00:26:10.566 --> 00:26:12.178
graduation.
When you leave Yale,

00:26:12.178 --> 00:26:14.429
what do you want--like,
"I had X sexual partners,

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:17.720
and that's what I wanted."
Or your lifetime?

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.730
We get people to answer these
questions.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.427
Professor Chun last year in
this course had clickers,

00:26:24.427 --> 00:26:28.021
and he got people to do it.
We are not so high tech,

00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:30.190
so we'll just do it in our
heads.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.589
But here is the way the answers
come out.

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:35.039
Women say less than one in the
next month.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.970
That doesn't mean they want
less than one;

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.384
that means many of them--many
of them say zero,

00:26:40.384 --> 00:26:46.650
some say one and so on.
One--four to five.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:55.968
Men--two, eight, eighteen.
You can ask other questions

00:26:55.968 --> 00:26:58.689
from this population.
So, you could ask,

00:26:58.689 --> 00:27:01.749
"Would you have sex with a
desirable partner you have

00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:04.750
known--so somebody really
desirable--for a year;

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.075
women say yes,
six months--unsure,

00:27:08.075 --> 00:27:14.064
week or less--no.
Men [laughter]--and with men

00:27:14.064 --> 00:27:21.049
you could get a majority going
to five minutes.

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:25.541
This is all Q &amp;
A, pen and pencil sort of

00:27:25.541 --> 00:27:28.039
things.
Some brave scientists have

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:30.839
actually done experiments.
And in one experiment

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:33.434
somebody--I don't,
you know, this is the sort of

00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:36.140
thing which you probably
wouldn't do nowadays.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.085
This work has been done ten
years ago, where they have an

00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:42.399
incredibly attractive man and an
incredibly attractive woman and

00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:45.690
they approach people on campus.
They're not from campus;

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.424
they're actors brought in.
And they go to people,

00:27:48.424 --> 00:27:49.730
to strangers,
and they say,

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.790
"I've been noticing you around
campus.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.258
I find you very attractive.
Would you go out with me

00:27:55.258 --> 00:27:56.729
tonight?
Would you come over to my

00:27:56.729 --> 00:27:58.908
apartment tonight?
Would you go to bed with me

00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:01.376
tonight?"
The experiment you wouldn't

00:28:01.376 --> 00:28:05.636
think anybody would've done has
been done, and women about--a

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:08.818
very attractive man,
over half of the women

00:28:08.818 --> 00:28:11.069
approached say,
"Yeah, I will."

00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:12.862
Very few agree to this ["Would
you come to my apartment

00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:14.952
tonight?"], and nobody agrees to
this ["Would you go to bed with

00:28:14.952 --> 00:28:17.283
me tonight?"].
For men, the data are like

00:28:17.283 --> 00:28:20.550
this, they go up to there and
then up to there .

00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:30.459
In this study,
the twenty five percent of

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:34.339
males who said "no" apologized
profusely,

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:37.612
and they said,
"Oh, you know,

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:42.990
my fiancé's in town,
and [unintelligible]."

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.686
What about behavior?
Well, you--if we're interested

00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:52.608
in sex differences,
you can't actually figure out

00:28:52.608 --> 00:28:56.093
what people want,
male female differences,

00:28:56.093 --> 00:28:59.498
by looking at simply at the
average number of times people

00:28:59.498 --> 00:29:02.544
have sex because if males and
females have different

00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:05.141
priorities,
then heterosexual sex is a

00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:09.309
compromise between two groups of
people with competing interests.

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:15.846
What's a more clear reflection
then is gay sex between two

00:29:15.846 --> 00:29:21.810
women or between two men,
because then you get a pure

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.930
reflection of sexual desire.
Now, the data here tend to be

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.222
very messy.
Again, they're survey studies

00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:32.667
but by and large every study
done tends to find a difference

00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:36.907
in the expected direction,
which is that females tend to

00:29:36.907 --> 00:29:42.089
be--lesbians tend to be much
more monogamous than gay men.

00:29:42.089 --> 00:29:46.977
Some studies prior to AIDS –
this was many years ago –

00:29:46.977 --> 00:29:50.750
found gay men to be extremely
promiscuous,

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.440
often having over a hundred or
over a thousand partners.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.789
You wouldn't find this sort of
promiscuity in females.

00:29:56.789 --> 00:30:00.969
And a way to think about this
is, what these gay men are doing

00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:05.012
is exactly what your average
heterosexual man would do if he

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:08.849
had that degree of willing
females who were as willing as

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:11.534
he was.
And this all suggests that

00:30:11.534 --> 00:30:15.743
there's some sort of difference
along lines expected in sexual

00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:19.522
choosiness in humans.
What about sexual

00:30:19.522 --> 00:30:23.290
attractiveness?
What about mate preference?

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.608
What do we find attractive?
Well, unlike the choosiness

00:30:26.608 --> 00:30:30.853
studies, here we actually have
some pretty good cross-cultural

00:30:30.853 --> 00:30:32.353
data.
So one study,

00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:35.475
for instance,
was done in 10,000 people from

00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:38.161
thirty-seven countries,
asking people,

00:30:38.161 --> 00:30:41.606
"Who do you want to be with?"
And there are different

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.069
studies, some of them asking,
"Who do you want to marry?"

00:30:44.069 --> 00:30:46.910
Other studies,
"Who do you want as a mate?

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.759
Who do you want as a sexual
partner?"

00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:53.253
And one main finding is kind of
reassuring, everybody likes

00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:57.668
kindness and intelligence,
or at least everybody says they

00:30:57.668 --> 00:31:02.500
like kindness and intelligence.
These are valued pretty highly.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.200
But at the same time,
there are sex differences.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.144
Females focus more on power and
status and more on interest in

00:31:10.144 --> 00:31:13.176
investing in children.
And think about that from an

00:31:13.176 --> 00:31:15.000
evolutionary point of view and
it makes sense.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.295
It doesn't matter hugely,
from the standpoint of

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:20.750
reproduction,
how old the man is.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.963
The difference between fifteen
and twenty-five and thirty-five

00:31:23.963 --> 00:31:27.440
and forty-five may matter a lot
for his status in the community,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.972
his physical strength,
his lifespan but from the

00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:32.720
standpoint of his sperm it
doesn't matter hugely.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.661
Later on there's a drop off and
it does begin to matter,

00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:38.958
but it doesn't matter hugely.
What does matter is his

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:42.804
interest in being a good father,
in protecting you from

00:31:42.804 --> 00:31:44.538
predation,
from murder,

00:31:44.538 --> 00:31:48.650
from assault by other people,
and in taking care of the kid.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.435
Women's brains are wired up to
find males with those

00:31:52.435 --> 00:31:55.925
properties.
Similarly, males focus a little

00:31:55.925 --> 00:31:58.874
bit differently.
They're more interested in all

00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:01.324
of these things,
but also on the ability to have

00:32:01.324 --> 00:32:03.483
children.
So, from an evolutionary point

00:32:03.483 --> 00:32:06.345
of view, there's actually a very
big difference between a

00:32:06.345 --> 00:32:08.390
twenty-year old and a fifty-year
old,

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.837
from a male standpoint looking
at a female, because the one can

00:32:11.837 --> 00:32:13.950
have offspring and the other
cannot.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.397
So, this is a difference.
But what I want to focus more

00:32:18.397 --> 00:32:21.490
on right now is back to another
similarity.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:27.341
Everybody likes beauty.
And I want to devote a little

00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:30.900
bit of this lecture to talking
about physical beauty.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.806
Physical beauty,
as these beautiful people say,

00:32:34.806 --> 00:32:38.338
is a curse.
So she--she's like a big model,

00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:40.297
a supermodel,
maybe even a

00:32:40.297 --> 00:32:44.998
super-supermodel--points out the
arbitrariness of finding her

00:32:44.998 --> 00:32:49.020
devastatingly beautiful.
Famous actor points out how

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.911
frustrating it is that people
only ignore his accomplishments

00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:55.700
and focus merely on his physical
beauty.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.839
This is very frustrating.
So what is beauty?

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:04.577
What does this mean we say we
find--you know,

00:33:04.577 --> 00:33:08.569
yeah, they really are very
attractive people.

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.239
What is it about that that
makes you look and say,

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:14.058
"Yeah, that makes sense?"
Well, we kind of know the

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:16.019
answer.
We know some universals.

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:19.180
Beauty seems to signal two
things.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:27.380
Beauty seems to signal youth--I
mean, not pre-school youth,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:33.460
but youth like sexually mature
but young.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.650
And so the cues we find
beautiful are cues to that –

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.130
large eyes, full lips,
smooth, tight skin.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.789
Beauty signals something else.
Beauty is a marker for health.

00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:50.085
And so what we find beautiful,
things like the absence of

00:33:50.085 --> 00:33:53.664
deformities, clear eyes,
unblemished skin,

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:59.069
intact teeth – that's very
big – and an average face.

00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:02.900
And that last part might seem a
little bit strange.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.509
What would be so good about an
average face?

00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:09.165
And there are different answers
to that, but one answer is,

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:11.972
an average face,
on average, should be

00:34:11.972 --> 00:34:16.431
considered attractive because
any sort of deformities are

00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:21.057
variations from the average.
And if you average every face

00:34:21.057 --> 00:34:24.851
together, you get a face
that--where nothing bad has

00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:27.710
happened to it.
There's no distortion,

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.748
there's no deviation.
As one gets older,

00:34:30.748 --> 00:34:34.289
the face gets less symmetrical
and so on.

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:38.462
Average-ness seems to factor
out all the bad things that

00:34:38.462 --> 00:34:40.900
could happen.
Good theory.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.983
How do we know it's true?
Well, there's a photo roster

00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:49.329
that comes--that I have access
to for this class.

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:53.218
So, I can look at each of your
pictures, and I will make you a

00:34:53.218 --> 00:34:56.980
bet about who has the most
beautiful face in this course.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.260
The bet is it would be all of
you.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.226
Aw.
Wouldn't it be funny if I

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:10.388
shouted out somebody's name?
And you know,

00:35:10.388 --> 00:35:13.560
A) I don't have the energy to
do this, and B) it would

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.792
probably violate four hundred
different privacy laws or

00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:19.643
whatever.
But if I took all those faces

00:35:19.643 --> 00:35:23.740
and morphed them together,
I would get a very pretty face.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.139
And how do we know this?
Well, people have done this.

00:35:27.139 --> 00:35:32.210
They've done it with--so look
at the faces from here to here.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.337
And if you are like most
people, you see as you're going

00:35:35.337 --> 00:35:38.750
to the right they're looking
better and better and better.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.254
It's subtle,
but it's actually not so subtle

00:35:42.254 --> 00:35:46.151
that babies don't notice it.
The same researchers who

00:35:46.151 --> 00:35:49.295
constructed this--these
face--these average Caucasian

00:35:49.295 --> 00:35:50.852
faces,
male and female,

00:35:50.852 --> 00:35:54.457
have shown these faces to
babies and find that babies that

00:35:54.457 --> 00:35:57.684
prefer to look at average
faces--suggesting that our

00:35:57.684 --> 00:36:01.289
preference for averaging is not
the product of culture but

00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:04.010
rather is to some extent
hard-wired.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:09.230
These two people don't exist.
They're computer composites.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:14.330
They're a heavily averaged male
face and a heavily averaged

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.640
female face, both from a
Caucasian data sample.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.430
They don't look bad right?
They're good faces.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.015
They don't cheat.
So the hair,

00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:24.787
for instance,
is identical--so they

00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:28.789
don't--you can't use hair cues.
But they're pretty attractive.

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:32.969
But the story of attractiveness
does not end there.

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:35.420
How do you get a better than
average face?

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.643
What can you do to these faces,
these average faces,

00:36:38.643 --> 00:36:42.810
and make them look even better?
Well, I'll have a vote.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.500
Who's prettier?
Who says the one on the right?

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.045
Who says the one on the left?
Left is average face,

00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:53.570
and there might be variation in
this class.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:58.469
There are definitely variations
in what people favor.

00:36:58.469 --> 00:37:02.070
This is a feminized version of
the average face where certain

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.489
prototype features were made
more feminine than average to

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.890
cue this as more of a sexual
object.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.730
This is more complicated.

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:30.710
Who thinks face A is more
attractive?

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.230
Who thinks face B is more
attractive?

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:39.719
Okay.
Most people like face B.

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:42.842
The exception is,
and this has been statistically

00:37:42.842 --> 00:37:45.510
replicated, I think,
now in three labs.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.406
Face A is preferred by women
who are ovulating,

00:37:50.406 --> 00:37:56.154
and the story about why is
complicated and will take us

00:37:56.154 --> 00:38:01.463
beyond the scope of this class.
But currently the idea is that

00:38:01.463 --> 00:38:04.687
this is a really handsome guy;
he's young, he's healthy,

00:38:04.687 --> 00:38:06.719
he looks strong,
good provider;

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:10.287
this guy is really hot,
and he may not be a good

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:14.310
provider and everything,
but I'm sure he has wonderful

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.056
genes.
So, the idea is that one should

00:38:17.056 --> 00:38:20.390
have sex with him and then have
him raise the kids.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.736
We've talked so far about
things, about sex and sexual

00:38:28.736 --> 00:38:32.598
attractiveness largely from a
biological perspective,

00:38:32.598 --> 00:38:35.180
looking at universals.
And in fact,

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.110
there are some universals in
what men and women have in

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.659
common and what distinguishes
men and women.

00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:44.578
And in some of the sex
differences, particularly

00:38:44.578 --> 00:38:48.912
related to aggression and mate
preference, seem to be

00:38:48.912 --> 00:38:51.691
universal.
They seem to show up to some

00:38:51.691 --> 00:38:54.568
extent across every culture you
look at and, hence,

00:38:54.568 --> 00:38:57.559
are likely candidates for
biological adaptations.

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:01.616
But there are other sex
differences that people are

00:39:01.616 --> 00:39:05.510
aware of where the origins are
far less clear.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.597
And I think that intelligent,
reasonable people could

00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:11.268
disagree about this,
but I am personally quite

00:39:11.268 --> 00:39:14.949
skeptical about the extent to
which these reflect biology.

00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:20.793
I'll mention them to capture
the debate, but the thing to

00:39:20.793 --> 00:39:24.550
keep in mind here is that
biology,

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.123
natural selection,
is one reason why the men in

00:39:27.123 --> 00:39:30.199
this class might differ from the
women in this class.

00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:31.625
But of course,
there are other,

00:39:31.625 --> 00:39:34.469
social, factors.
Babies are treated differently.

00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:37.625
There have been many studies
where you take a baby and

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:41.376
swaddle it in blue and describe
it as a boy versus swaddle it in

00:39:41.376 --> 00:39:44.935
pink and describe it as a girl,
and people treat it differently

00:39:44.935 --> 00:39:47.840
when they think it's a boy than
when they think it's a girl.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.471
You're treated differently too.
It matters a lot--and there's

00:39:53.471 --> 00:39:56.426
study after study suggesting,
for instance,

00:39:56.426 --> 00:40:00.720
that when you send an email or
a job application or a paper to

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.358
a scientific journal,
it matters whether it has the

00:40:05.358 --> 00:40:10.199
name John Smith on it versus the
name Joan Smith.

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:13.422
It matters because people have
different expectations and

00:40:13.422 --> 00:40:16.070
different reactions to males
versus females.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.286
Some if you may have firsthand
experience with this if you're a

00:40:20.286 --> 00:40:24.095
man with a name that could be
taken as a woman's name –

00:40:24.095 --> 00:40:27.784
friend of mine is named Lynn,
and often people think he's

00:40:27.784 --> 00:40:30.942
female – or if you're a woman
who has a name that could be

00:40:30.942 --> 00:40:33.580
taken as a man's name,
or if you have a name

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.294
sufficiently foreign to Western
ears that people can't easily

00:40:37.294 --> 00:40:39.708
tell.
You'll often find people

00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:43.865
saying, "Oh," people are
high-fiving each other there

00:40:43.865 --> 00:40:48.741
--you'll often find some degree
of surprise and some degree of

00:40:48.741 --> 00:40:51.638
people saying,
"Oh my, I didn't know you were

00:40:51.638 --> 00:40:53.601
a man.
Now I will treat you

00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:56.653
differently."
And so, these social factors

00:40:56.653 --> 00:41:00.120
could play a role in explaining
some male and female

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.364
differences.
Also, there are the facts of

00:41:03.364 --> 00:41:06.561
gender self-segregation.
So here something very

00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:08.599
interesting happens
developmentally.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:12.349
Males segregate with other
males;

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:16.782
females segregate with other
females--for a period lasting,

00:41:16.782 --> 00:41:20.909
it depends on the culture,
but say from age four to age

00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:24.095
eleven.
This self-segregation might

00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:27.570
exaggerate and enhance sex
differences.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.965
It might be,
for instance,

00:41:28.965 --> 00:41:31.979
as Eleanor Maccoby has
proposed, that boys are slightly

00:41:31.979 --> 00:41:35.752
more aggressive than girls.
But then boys go into groups of

00:41:35.752 --> 00:41:39.375
boys, and that enhances and
exaggerates their aggression

00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:42.998
while the girls' non-aggressive
behavior is enhanced and

00:41:42.998 --> 00:41:47.610
exaggerated in different ways by
them falling into girls' groups.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.033
So, what sort of differences
are we talking about when we say

00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:55.321
we're not sure of their cause?
Well, one difference is one in

00:41:55.321 --> 00:41:58.354
empathy.
So Simon Baron-Cohen wrote a

00:41:58.354 --> 00:42:03.108
wonderful book called The
Essential Difference where

00:42:03.108 --> 00:42:07.369
he argues that men are by nature
less empathetic,

00:42:07.369 --> 00:42:12.144
women are by nature more
empathetic, and that this is a

00:42:12.144 --> 00:42:16.030
core sex difference.
So, what do you know?

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.949
Well, what's the source for
this?

00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:20.010
One thing is men are more
violent.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.551
Simon Baron-Cohen describes
violence as the ultimate

00:42:23.551 --> 00:42:27.369
act--murder as the ultimate act
of a lack of empathy.

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:32.241
There's some relationship
between how much testosterone

00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:37.113
you have in your system and how
social you are – more

00:42:37.113 --> 00:42:39.820
testosterone,
less social.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.901
Boys tend to be less empathetic
than girls, and there's some

00:42:43.901 --> 00:42:46.599
evidence, though it's not
conclusive,

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:50.284
that boys do worse than girls
on social cognition theory of

00:42:50.284 --> 00:42:53.016
mind tasks.
That's what I have here,

00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:57.443
though that is quite debated.
And the biggest effect,

00:42:57.443 --> 00:43:02.239
which isn't debated at all,
is problems with empathy,

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:07.648
problems of social cognition,
are much more frequent in men

00:43:07.648 --> 00:43:11.068
than in women.
So, these disorders like

00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:14.926
autism, Asperger's Syndrome,
conduct disorder and

00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:17.980
psychopathy are predominately
male.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.641
And Simon Baron-Cohen suggests
that--basically,

00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:26.258
he has this slogan where he
says, "To be a man is to suffer

00:43:26.258 --> 00:43:29.840
from a particularly mild form of
autism."

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.239
That males are just socially
clueless relative to women.

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:38.593
Final bit of trivia--This is
Simon Baron Cohen,

00:43:38.593 --> 00:43:43.040
who is a very famous
developmental psychologist,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.340
but his cousin Sasha Baron
Cohen is far more famous.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.316
Another debate is a debate
concerning sex differences in

00:43:52.316 --> 00:43:54.920
the capacity for math and
science.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.606
A few years ago there used to
be a president of Harvard known

00:43:59.606 --> 00:44:03.738
as Larry Summers.
There are so many reasons to

00:44:03.738 --> 00:44:08.059
hiss at this point.
And Larry Summers is no longer

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:13.241
president of Harvard for various
reasons, but one reason was this

00:44:13.241 --> 00:44:15.172
quote,
which included in his

00:44:15.172 --> 00:44:18.206
speculations about sex
differences, "...in the special

00:44:18.206 --> 00:44:21.752
case of science and engineering,
there are issues of intrinsic

00:44:21.752 --> 00:44:25.050
aptitude, and particularly of
the variability of aptitude..."

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.992
He argued, or suggested,
that the under-representation

00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:32.860
of women in the sciences in
academia is because of an

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.241
intrinsic aptitude difference;
women are, on average,

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:42.289
less biologically predisposed
to do this sort of reasoning.

00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:45.884
The variability point is that
he wasn't suggesting that

00:44:45.884 --> 00:44:48.480
there's just a difference on
average.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.967
In fact, he agreed that the
average skills of men and women

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:55.201
are identical.
The claim is that males show

00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.291
more variation.
This means that there are more

00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:01.875
male retarded people and more
males who are just horribly bad

00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:05.400
at this, but it also means there
are more male geniuses.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.099
And he suggested that this
plays a role.

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:11.186
This, as you can imagine,
proved to be an extremely

00:45:11.186 --> 00:45:14.211
controversial claim,
and rather than go through it

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:18.038
– because it would take me a
class to treat the pros and cons

00:45:18.038 --> 00:45:21.680
of this argument responsibly –
I'm going to refer you to a

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.519
wonderful debate between Steve
Pinker,

00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:28.306
who was quoted earlier,
and Liz Spelke who's one of the

00:45:28.306 --> 00:45:31.724
big infant cognition people.
And we spoke a lot about her

00:45:31.724 --> 00:45:34.610
work earlier on in the course.
And they have a wonderful

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.873
debate between two of the
smartest people I know on The

00:45:37.873 --> 00:45:41.259
Edge,
which was done at Harvard about

00:45:41.259 --> 00:45:44.219
a year ago and is on video here
.

00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:47.774
So, if you're interested in sex
differences and different

00:45:47.774 --> 00:45:50.758
theories about the mechanism of
sex differences,

00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:55.985
this is where you should go.
Finally, and a final topic,

00:45:55.985 --> 00:46:02.969
some of us, about 98%--and the
numbers are very difficult to

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.619
pin down.
Maybe it isn't 98%;

00:46:05.619 --> 00:46:08.150
maybe it's ninety-seven,
maybe it's ninety-nine.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:14.360
Let's say 98% of women are
sexually attracted to men.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.280
About 96% of men are sexually
attracted to women.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.154
And the numbers vary and it's
very difficult to estimate it

00:46:23.154 --> 00:46:24.602
properly.
As you could imagine,

00:46:24.602 --> 00:46:27.179
there are all sorts of problems
with this sort of research.

00:46:27.179 --> 00:46:30.041
But there's some proportion of
the population that's

00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:33.351
exclusively homosexual--some
proportion of the population of

00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:35.820
men who are only attracted to
other men,

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.693
some proportion of the
population of women who are only

00:46:38.693 --> 00:46:42.170
attracted to other women.
When people talk about sexual

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.336
orientation here,
it's important to realize we

00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:48.079
are not talking here about
behavior.

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:52.197
There are all sorts of reasons
why somebody might have sex with

00:46:52.197 --> 00:46:56.130
somebody of the same sex.
You know, they might be bored.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.165
You may, you know,
be experimenting,

00:46:58.165 --> 00:46:59.818
be whatever.
The question is,

00:46:59.818 --> 00:47:02.522
"What do you want to do?"
All things being equal,

00:47:02.522 --> 00:47:05.265
what sort of person--if you
could be sexually or

00:47:05.265 --> 00:47:08.650
romantically involved with any
person, who would it be?

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.309
And most people are
heterosexual.

00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:14.351
There's a considerable amount
that varies cross-culturally of

00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:17.303
people who are bisexual.
But the real puzzle is

00:47:17.303 --> 00:47:20.910
exclusive homosexuality.
So, why?

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.933
Well, nobody knows.
We know some reasons,

00:47:24.933 --> 00:47:27.739
some answers are probably not
right.

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:30.452
It is not the case,
almost certainly – maybe

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:33.828
there are some exceptions –
but it is not the case that

00:47:33.828 --> 00:47:36.420
people choose their sexual
orientation.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.865
I'm not going to do this in
this room, but if you asked

00:47:39.865 --> 00:47:43.693
people to raise their hands as
to how many people decided who

00:47:43.693 --> 00:47:48.119
to become sexually attracted to,
very few people would.

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:52.574
Part of the issue rises in the
fact that people who are gay are

00:47:52.574 --> 00:47:56.814
often extremely discriminated
against, and they have no wish

00:47:56.814 --> 00:47:59.083
to be gay.
They might even think it's

00:47:59.083 --> 00:48:00.980
morally wrong for them to be
that way.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.928
That makes it implausible that
their sexual orientation is a

00:48:04.928 --> 00:48:09.364
conscious choice.
What about experience after

00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:12.253
puberty?
So, there is a view that keeps

00:48:12.253 --> 00:48:16.041
coming up over and over again in
the literature that people who

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:19.280
are gay have in some sense been
seduced by people,

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.210
by other people--or something
happened to them afterwards.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.913
This seems unlikely.
There are in particular the

00:48:26.913 --> 00:48:31.926
seeds of sexual orientation
later on in life seem to show up

00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:35.557
quite early in life.
Again, the studies are sort of

00:48:35.557 --> 00:48:39.025
suspect, but there's some reason
to believe that people who are

00:48:39.025 --> 00:48:42.436
gay and people who are straight
are different long before they

00:48:42.436 --> 00:48:46.239
hit puberty with regard to their
sexual and romantic fantasies.

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:50.835
You would now expect me to say,
"Well, being gay and being

00:48:50.835 --> 00:48:53.789
straight is built in.
It's hard-wired.

00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:55.050
None of these stories seem
right.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.139
It seems to be built in."
And the answer to that is,

00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:01.860
sort of.
So, if you do the standard

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.598
behavioral genetic tests,
and you by now know how to do

00:49:05.598 --> 00:49:09.406
them--you'd look for differences
between monozygotic and

00:49:09.406 --> 00:49:12.114
dizygotic twins,
you'd do the adoption

00:49:12.114 --> 00:49:15.162
comparison--you know adopted
siblings and biological

00:49:15.162 --> 00:49:17.276
siblings.
The answer is yes,

00:49:17.276 --> 00:49:21.699
you find that there is some
sort of genetic predisposition

00:49:21.699 --> 00:49:27.814
towards homosexuality.
But it can't be entirely

00:49:27.814 --> 00:49:31.262
genetic.
One reason why it can't be

00:49:31.262 --> 00:49:34.447
entirely genetic is,
if I'm gay and I have an

00:49:34.447 --> 00:49:38.101
identical twin,
the odds that my identical twin

00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:41.059
will be gay--it's about fifty
percent.

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:44.582
Those are very high odds
compared to the average in the

00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:47.934
population.
But if it was truly genetic,

00:49:47.934 --> 00:49:51.960
entirely genetic,
what should the number be?

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.210
A hundred percent – he's my
clone.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.989
He should be exactly as I am.
And it's not.

00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:01.525
So, we know then that some sort
of experience,

00:50:01.525 --> 00:50:05.610
possibly prenatal experience,
is what explains it.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:10.908
Why is it so – I said before
this is a huge puzzle – why is

00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:15.473
it such a huge puzzle?
Well, exclusive homosexuality

00:50:15.473 --> 00:50:20.058
is an evolutionary mystery.
Again, do not think that this

00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:24.292
carries any moral weight to it.
What it does mean though is

00:50:24.292 --> 00:50:28.340
that it doesn't seem to follow
as a biological adaptation.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:34.640
The puzzle is not why is it
that some men have sex with men.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.116
That's not a big puzzle.
Maybe they have sex with men as

00:50:37.116 --> 00:50:39.970
some sort of recreational things
or pair bonding or whatever.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.784
That's not the puzzle.
The puzzle is why are there

00:50:43.784 --> 00:50:47.739
some men who don't want to have
sex with women?

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:51.620
Similarly, why are there some
women who don't want to have sex

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.309
with men?
From an evolutionary adaptive

00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:58.701
standpoint, you would think that
the genes that give rise to such

00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:02.613
a behavior would be weeded out
because creatures with that

00:51:02.613 --> 00:51:05.556
behavior typically,
putting aside modern

00:51:05.556 --> 00:51:07.760
technology, don't have
offspring.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.179
And that's what makes it such a
puzzle.

00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:14.924
So, your reading response for
this week is "solve that

00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:17.095
puzzle."
I know I said early on in the

00:51:17.095 --> 00:51:19.646
course that reading responses
would be really easy and just

00:51:19.646 --> 00:51:21.230
require you reciting back
things,

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.409
but that proved to be too
boring.

00:51:23.409 --> 00:51:26.369
So, just solve this deepest of
all puzzle.

00:51:26.369 --> 00:51:29.320
The thing in brackets at the
end is very important.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.456
Your account,
whatever it is,

00:51:31.456 --> 00:51:35.806
should bear some relationship
to the facts as discussed in

00:51:35.806 --> 00:51:40.190
lectures and readings.
We have about five more minutes.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:44.300
Any questions or thoughts?
Yes?

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.440
Student:
I like your leather jacket.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.600
Professor Paul Bloom:
Thank you very much.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:54.635
She likes my leather jacket.
Any questions or thoughts,

00:51:54.635 --> 00:51:56.910
just like that one?
No.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.385
Yes?
Student:

00:51:59.385 --> 00:52:05.009
My question's not exactly like
that one, but in other animals

00:52:05.009 --> 00:52:09.789
do they--is there similar data
on other species?

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:11.650
Professor Paul Bloom: On
sexual preferences?

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.805
That's a very good question
because certainly your answer to

00:52:14.805 --> 00:52:17.853
the origin – give me two more
minutes – certainly your

00:52:17.853 --> 00:52:20.955
answer about the origin of
sexual preference in humans will

00:52:20.955 --> 00:52:23.949
be informed by the question of
cross-species data.

00:52:23.949 --> 00:52:27.125
What we do know is that there
are many animals that engage in

00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:30.036
homosexual behavior;
they engage in sex with members

00:52:30.036 --> 00:52:32.972
of their own sex.
What I don't know is whether

00:52:32.972 --> 00:52:35.650
you get exclusive homosexual
behavior.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.644
So, I don't know what the rate
is in nonhuman primates,

00:52:38.644 --> 00:52:41.029
for instance,
of primates who do not want to

00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:43.579
have sex with members of the
opposite sex.

00:52:43.579 --> 00:52:47.000
Okay, I'll see you all
Wednesday.

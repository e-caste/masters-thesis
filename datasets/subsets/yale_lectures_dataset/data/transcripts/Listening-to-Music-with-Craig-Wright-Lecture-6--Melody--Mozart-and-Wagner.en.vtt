00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.390
Prof: All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's get started.
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880
We are going to continue our
discussion of melody,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.680
and last Thursday we were
talking about melody in terms of

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.620
scales: major scales,
minor scales, chromatic scales.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.791
Then we went on to talk a
little bit about what it is in a

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:24.181
melody that makes us feel the
way we do about that particular

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.354
melody--
the major and minor quality of

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:30.341
them,
and the fact that that quality

00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:33.610
shows up rather early on in the
scale,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.800
the third step of the scale.
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.020
Then we talked about conjunct
melodies,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.128
and disjunct melodies,
and we ended up talking about

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:44.957
Beethoven's Ode to Joy,
which he incorporated in the

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.360
last movement of his last
symphony,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.560
Symphony no. nine.
 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.868
And we said that that had a
particular quality of phrase

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:57.490
construction--antecedent and
consequent phrase structure.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.600
&gt;
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.340
Opening it up--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.650
--and closing it back down.
 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.697
And I was thinking over the
weekend of all the pieces that

00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:15.379
operate that way.
 

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:19.430
&gt;
 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.420
Antecedent--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.010
--consequent.
 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.820
And then it goes on with an
extension the way Beethoven went

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.180
on with an extension--
&gt;

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.560
Antecedent-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.920
--consequent.
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:54.587
I was a thinking of a piece of
Mozart--&lt;&lt;plays

00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:59.489
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.390
Was that really Mozart?
 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.674
Well let's listen here to just
a little bit of what that really

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:04.939
is.
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:15.280
 
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.050
Okay.
 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:34.569
&gt;
 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.509
All right.
 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.800
That's enough of that.
 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.110
Dumb pet trick.
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.074
All I did was take the theme of
the Macarena and strip

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:44.150
away all the rhythmic stuff
underneath,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.008
and put an eighteenth-century
Alberti bass with it,

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:55.384
that Mozart would have
used--&lt;&lt;plays

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.449
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.038
--and so on.
 

00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:02.587
But the point here is that even
the Macarena is using

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:06.197
this antecedent and consequent
phrase structure--something as

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:07.280
basic as that.
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.110
So it's sort of endemic to how
melodies are constructed.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.722
Now I was thinking--and I
always like to try to come up

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:16.198
with new, however albeit
lame-brained,

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.538
ideas--for teaching this class.
 

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:21.570
Supposing I got a student up
here, I mean melody--what makes

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.650
a melody beautiful?
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.319
What makes a great melody?
 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.158
Anybody know?
 

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:27.924
Well, if you do,
let me know,

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:30.949
because I don't know,
and nobody really knows.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.329
It's sort of like the
definition of pornography:

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.164
you know it when you see it,
or you know it when you hear

00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:36.520
it.
 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.740
So in pursuit of this,
I was trying to think,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.406
"Well, maybe I'll have a
student come up and try to craft

00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:47.810
a melody right here on the
spot."

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.508
And I supposed we could play
with that,

00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:52.084
but then I said,
"That's probably not a

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:54.455
good idea,
because a) No student would

00:03:54.455 --> 00:03:57.757
really want to do this,
and b) It would probably take

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:00.639
too long to work through all the
aspects of it."

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.945
So what I did--and this was
about four o'clock yesterday

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:04.497
afternoon--and I thought,
"Craig,

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:05.840
you think up a melody."
 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.881
So I started thinking up a
melody, and I hope I can

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.280
remember how it went.
 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:41.370
&gt;
 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.649
Something like that.
 

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.100
So what would you give me as a
grade for that melody?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.149
Come on, now.
 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:52.800
Daniel, what do I get for that
melody?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.420
B minus? C plus?
 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.824
Student:  B..
 

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:56.170
Prof: B?
 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.079
Well, this is the days of grade
inflation.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.120
I've been inflated up to a B.
 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.439
It was kind of C, C minus.
 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.620
It wasn't particularly inspired.
 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.632
But in crafting that,
it made me think of "Why

00:05:09.632 --> 00:05:13.189
do I do this at this particular
point and not that?"

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.759
Well, there are certain
confines that we're operating

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:17.240
with.
 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.560
We've got to be in a scale.
 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.459
&gt;
 

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:22.790
Certain kinds of
phrases--&lt;&lt;plays

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.709
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.036
--something ending like that in
a piece that's going to end

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:27.439
here--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.540
--tells me that's got to be in
the middle;

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.579
that can't come at the end.
 

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:32.319
So there's a syntax here also.
 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.168
We've talked about that before,
that musical phrases have to

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:39.560
come in a particular order for
them to make sense.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.475
So instead of working with my
lame-brained melody,

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.259
let's work with a great one.
 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.473
We're going to work a melody by
Giacomo Puccini here,

00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:50.315
and you can see his name on the
board up there,

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.160
and get a sense of the melody
in question.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.504
It's an aria-- and we'll talk
about what an aria is later--but

00:05:56.504 --> 00:05:59.410
it's an aria from his opera
Gianni Schicchi.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.139
Now, that's not a well-known
opera by Puccini;

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.920
can anybody tell me the name of
a better-known opera by Puccini?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.569
Student:  Tosca..
 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:07.259
Prof: Tosca,
yes.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.605
Student:  Madame
Butterfly..

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:09.920
Prof: Madame
Butterfly.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.052
You haven't hit the most
obvious yet--La

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:13.730
Bohème,
for example.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.730
Rent was based on La
Bohème.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.360
So he has written a lot of
well-known operas;

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.750
this happens to be a
lesser-known opera.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.884
But it has one sort of
drop-dead beautiful melody in

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:27.060
the thing,
"O mio babbino caro,"

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.276
where a young lady is trying,
in effect, to con some money

00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:31.019
out of her father.
 

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.764
And it's an odd thing,
this thing so beautiful--trying

00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:38.579
to separate her father from
money is an odd thought.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:41.327
And it occurs rather early on
in the opera,

00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:41.720
too.
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.980
And dramatically,
it's not of any particular

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.769
significance.
 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:48.553
It just happens to be an
absolutely gorgeous melody that

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:51.029
you've all heard many,
many times.

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.829
One day--you'll recognize it as
soon as I start to play it--one

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:57.779
day I was playing this at home;
my then-thirteen-year-old son

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.920
came in and said,
"I know that.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.500
That's beautiful."
 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.930
I said, "Ah, that's my boy.
 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.350
He's going to be a music
lover."

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.322
"Yes, that's the
background music for Grand

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:11.689
Theft Auto."
 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.529
"What's Grand Theft
Auto, Chris?"

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:17.778
Well, I found out.
 

00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:22.699
But it shows you that this
particular aria has legs.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.470
It's kind of everywhere.
 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.637
So let's listen to a little bit
of Puccini's "O mio bambino

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:31.910
caro."
 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:47.600
&gt;
 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.339
Okay, let's pause it right
there.

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:50.500
Let's pause it.
 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.230
&gt;
 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.747
What's kind of neat about that,
right, at the outset

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:04.230
there--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.600
What's that?
 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.860
Why, again, do our spirits soar
at that particular point?

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.750
We've got a large leap there.
 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.879
It's the leap of a--
Student:  An octave.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.769
Prof: Of an octave.
 

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:19.538
We wouldn't expect you to
recognize that,

00:08:19.538 --> 00:08:22.190
but it's interesting to fold
that in, because we were talking

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.430
about octaves last time.
 

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.629
So we have this opening phrase,
and it's about to be coupled--

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:32.715
we're going to continue now--
with the next phrase that will

00:08:32.715 --> 00:08:36.120
complete the antecedent phrase.
 

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:52.250
&gt;
 

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:59.190
So we're sitting here--can you
see the tonic?

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.700
That's where we want to go,
that's where we want to go.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.908
So we're going to step right
above the tonic.

00:09:03.908 --> 00:09:05.926
So that's the end of the
antecedent phrase,

00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:08.278
the opening-up phrase,
but we're not on the tonic.

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:08.710
Okay?
 

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.629
So now we're going to continue,
and you can imagine we're going

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:13.230
to hear some of that same music.
 

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.354
But ultimately,
it's going to come back to the

00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:18.299
tonic;
we hadn't gone away from it.

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:20.559
Okay.
 

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.559
&gt;
 

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:25.059
Starting again.
 

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:31.240
&gt;
 

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.080
Here's our octave.
 

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:56.149
&gt;
 

00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:58.490
Now, something interesting
happened there.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.149
&gt;
 

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:03.820
Ah, there's our tonic.
 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.298
We should be back to our tonic.
 

00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:07.580
But that's not exactly what
happened.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.480
&gt;
 

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.168
We went to the tonic melody
note, but underneath he

00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:19.340
harmonized it with an unexpected
harmony.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.850
We expected to hear:
&gt;

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.740
We got: &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.509
So we were deceived there a
little bit.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:31.389
And musicians call this a
deceptive cadence.

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:33.735
When the whole thing has been
set up to come back to the tonic

00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:35.466
with the tonic chord
underneath--&lt;&lt;plays

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:36.120
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.860
--we get something other than
the tonic chord.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.279
So in music,
we have to kinds of really

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.190
broad categories of cadence.
 

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.009
We have this kind of thing
called--&lt;&lt;plays

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:45.590
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.308
Or: &gt;
 

00:10:47.308 --> 00:10:49.509
--where we come back to the
expected tonic.

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:51.519
We call those authentic
cadences.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:54.421
We also have another class of,
as mentioned,

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.457
deceptive cadences where we do
things such as:

00:10:57.457 --> 00:10:59.548
&gt;
 

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:01.710
Where you're expecting to go:
&gt;

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.379
But we go: &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:06.799
Or we go even more bizarre:
&gt;

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.360
Something like that.
 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.981
You keep the same tonic note in
the melody, but you change the

00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:13.230
harmony underneath.
 

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.450
So that's what Puccini has done
here.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.710
&gt;
 

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.846
Instead of going there,
he goes: &lt;&lt;plays

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:20.753
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:11:20.753 --> 00:11:21.519
--there.
 

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.090
Here is a silly analogy.
 

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.250
One time I was flying into the
city of Minneapolis.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.655
"Fasten your seat belts,
trays up,"

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.081
etc., etc., etc.;
we're coming right in there,

00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:36.072
you can see the tarmac there
and suddenly the plane goes

00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:37.158
"Zoom."
 

00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:40.721
It doesn't land,
it does a barrel roll almost

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:44.332
off to the right,
circles all the way around,

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:48.541
announces there was some piece
of equipment on the landing

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.418
strip,
and he was doing a flyover.

00:11:51.418 --> 00:11:53.850
In music, you have to do the
same kind of thing.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.903
If a composer has set this up
so that you're expecting to go:

00:11:56.903 --> 00:11:58.379
&gt;
 

00:11:58.379 --> 00:11:59.828
And you don't,
you go here-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:00.360
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.039
We can't end that way.
 

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.250
We just can't end that way.
 

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.070
We need our daily supply of
tonic.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.860
So what we've got to do is a
musical flyover.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.831
He's going to fly all around
this thing again,

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:14.528
and then come back in and this
time land on the tonic.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:39.039
So let's listen to the flyover:
&gt;

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:43.590
Here's our tonic.
 

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.889
But it's so lovely,
he can't stop.

00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:49.768
So he's going to give you a
little reminiscence of the

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:51.669
beginning--
&gt;

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:53.350
There's our octave.
 

00:12:53.350 --> 00:13:17.408
&gt;
 

00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:19.561
So there's just a little
reminiscence of the beginning,

00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:21.393
but again coming back and just
then, of course,

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:22.350
ending on the tonic.
 

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.630
So that's the structure of an
aria by Puccini,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.820
and it is highly structured.
 

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.003
Now I want to talk about
another aria that's structured

00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:34.009
in a different way,
and that's by Richard Wagner.

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:36.727
But before we do that,
we need to talk about one other

00:13:36.727 --> 00:13:38.779
process in music,
and that has to do with

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:40.730
something called melodic
sequence.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.908
And oddly, students over the
years have had difficulty

00:13:43.908 --> 00:13:46.610
understanding and hearing
melodic sequence.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.470
But it's a pretty simple idea.
 

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.456
Melodic sequence is simply the
repetition of a musical motive

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:58.110
at a successively higher or
lower degree of the scale.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.246
So I could take a
motive--anybody want to sing a

00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:02.649
motive for me here?
 

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:04.639
Daniel do you want to sing a
motive?

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.409
Give me four notes.
 

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:13.600
 
 

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:24.399
&gt;
 

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:28.570
So we've set up a descending
melodic sequence.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.159
Now, supposing we did this?
 

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:35.259
&gt;
 

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:39.220
That's obviously an ascending
melodic sequence.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.654
So that's what's involved here,
and generally speaking,

00:14:42.654 --> 00:14:44.879
going down introduces
relaxation;

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:46.860
going up, perhaps, tension.
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.029
All right.
 

00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:51.600
So that's a little bit of the
set up with regard to that.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.210
So now we're going to work
through this--

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.279
we'll call it an aria for the
moment--

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:00.538
of Wagner, in which,
rather than structured units,

00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:04.548
he's going to continually
evolve new music,

00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:09.649
but using a motive that he
presses up continually through

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:11.379
melodic sequence.
 

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:14.943
So it's a slightly different
process of melodic structure

00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:15.389
here.
 

00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:23.048
Richard Wagner--not a very nice
man, needless to say.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:26.504
But he was a spectacular
composer, and wrote many great

00:15:26.504 --> 00:15:27.080
things.
 

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.450
And one of them,
arguably the best that he

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.590
wrote, is his opera
Tristan.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.616
Tristan and Isolde,
written in 1865,

00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:37.139
as you can see on the board
here.

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:42.102
And we should know about it
because we here at Yale own the

00:15:42.102 --> 00:15:46.038
piano on which Wagner wrote
Tristan,

00:15:46.038 --> 00:15:47.950
or it was at least involved in
part of Tristan.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.408
Next time you are walking past
DUH over there,

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:54.668
you know, the Health Center,
at seventeen Hillhouse Avenue,

00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:56.947
there's a building there,
a rather foreboding looking

00:15:56.947 --> 00:15:57.428
building.
 

00:15:57.428 --> 00:15:59.692
Inside is a wonderful
collection of keyboard

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.428
instruments.
 

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:03.802
So go in there and look at the
Bechstein piano,

00:16:03.802 --> 00:16:07.102
this German piano,
Bechstein, that Wagner used

00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:09.668
when working on Tristan.
 

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:14.467
So we have the opera,
and we're going to start here

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:17.538
with a little bit of the plot.
 

00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:20.288
It's a story of this English
knight,

00:16:20.288 --> 00:16:23.860
Tristan, and this Irish
princess, Isolde,

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.206
and it's Tristan's job to go
over to Ireland and pick her up

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:30.725
and deliver her back to Cornwall
where she is supposed to marry

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:31.519
King Mark.
 

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:35.053
But en route,
they inadvertently consume a

00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:39.535
love potion, so she is
passionately in love with him,

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:41.259
and he with her.
 

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:44.432
So we're going to listen to a
little bit of the overture here

00:16:44.432 --> 00:16:44.750
now.
 

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.042
Wagner actually called it a
prelude--that doesn't

00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:51.058
matter--opening music here,
to Tristan.

00:16:51.058 --> 00:16:55.850
And I have two questions
for you as we listen here.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.899
What instruments are playing?
 

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:03.269
And what musical process is
Wagner using at this point?

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:54.400
&gt;
 

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.660
Okay, we're going to stop it
there, now.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.527
So what instruments were
playing there in that little

00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:02.670
dialogue--the dialogue between
families of instruments?

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.960
Strings, and?
 

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.798
Woodwinds.
 

00:18:06.798 --> 00:18:08.798
Okay, alternating back and
forth.

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:11.747
The strings were at the lower
point--&lt;&lt;plays

00:18:11.747 --> 00:18:12.650
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.876
--and the woodwinds would
answer--&lt;&lt;plays

00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:16.930
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:34.819
--then strings--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:35.630
And so on.
 

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.170
So what melodic process were
they using there?

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.108
Rising melodic sequence.
 

00:18:42.108 --> 00:18:49.869
All right, it sort of chugged
along until we got

00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:55.319
to--&gt;
 

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:56.368
What's this?
 

00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:01.559
We talked about this before in
regard to Richard Strauss.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:03.970
That sound?
 

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.670
It's a dissonant sound
resolving to consonant.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.347
So it uses this sequence to
work up to a climax,

00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:13.140
hits a dissonance,
resolves it into consonance.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.471
Let's listen to a little bit
further along here in the

00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:18.289
prelude.
 

00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:28.058
&gt;
 

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:30.680
Now he's churning his way up
here through sequence;

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.200
each level gets higher and
higher in the violins.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:20:03.259
&gt;
 

00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:04.808
Okay, let's stop it there.
 

00:20:04.808 --> 00:20:08.582
And you heard the trumpets come
in there--&lt;&lt;plays

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:09.630
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.393
--with that chromatic figure,
almost kind of like a snake

00:20:12.393 --> 00:20:13.380
rising through it.
 

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.269
So it's not only the rising
melodic sequence.

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:20.680
This is highly chromatic music,
and that also produces tension.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.230
How do you make love in music?
 

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.181
Well, you've got rising dynamic
volume, we've got rising

00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:31.421
sequence that works up to a
climax where there is dissonance

00:20:31.421 --> 00:20:32.930
and then release.
 

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.419
So if I'm using rather
suggestive language here,

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:38.348
it's done intentionally.
 

00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:41.400
This ain't Mary Poppins
or The Sound of Music or

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.450
Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs;

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.109
this is the passionate story of
Tristan and Isolde:

00:20:47.109 --> 00:20:49.306
lust, desire,
carnal knowledge,

00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:50.990
that sort of thing.
 

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.619
And how does Wagner give you
this sense?

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:54.380
How does he communicate this?
 

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.430
Well there's this idea of
continually rising sequence that

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.196
then hits this climax with a
dissonant, almost painful

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:05.038
dissonance, and then the
resolution;

00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:08.690
the music duplicating in an odd
way life's processes.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.027
The climax of the opera,
the real climax,

00:21:11.027 --> 00:21:14.532
however, really doesn't come
until about three hours into it,

00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:15.410
at the end.
 

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:21.240
Now we have Tristan dying of a
mortal wound.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.809
Isolde is cradling him in her
arms.

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:27.390
And she sings an aria.
 

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.950
We'll call it an aria;
Wagner called it a different

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.170
name, it's called the
"Liebestod."

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.038
She's singing about her vision
of their life in the hereafter,

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:41.710
in the world beyond,
in the celestial realm.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.204
And so it's called a
"love-death,"

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:48.556
a Liebestod here,
and it's typical,

00:21:48.556 --> 00:21:52.230
I suppose, of the conventions
of the Romantic period.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.891
This is the nineteenth century;
this is romance,

00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:57.019
Tristan and Isolde.
 

00:21:57.019 --> 00:22:02.397
So we're going to pick this up
about halfway through the

00:22:02.397 --> 00:22:07.680
Liebestod of Isolde,
and once again we will hear

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.690
these little snippets,
these motives.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:22.740
&lt;&lt;noise from
outside&gt;&gt;

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.868
I don't have absolute pitch.
 

00:22:23.868 --> 00:22:26.011
When you're really annoyed with
things in life,

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.713
you can sometimes at least have
some fun, enjoy it somehow,

00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:30.808
by trying to figure out what
key it's in.

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:34.010
That was a pipe in F we were
listening to,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.509
a rather unresonant pipe in F.
 

00:22:36.509 --> 00:22:39.246
Okay, so let's go back to the
midpoint of the Liebestod

00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:42.029
here, and we're going to
hear these little snippets.

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:43.900
This is not antecedent and
consequent;

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.203
this is a motive being pushed
higher and higher each time to a

00:22:48.203 --> 00:22:48.838
climax.
 

00:22:48.838 --> 00:24:06.358
Here we go:
&gt;

00:24:06.358 --> 00:24:09.490
Okay, we're going to pause it
there just for a second.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:10.650
It's glorious.
 

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.048
It's a glorious sound.
 

00:24:12.048 --> 00:24:15.582
And isn't it nice to have our
audio system working properly

00:24:15.582 --> 00:24:16.068
again?
 

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:18.319
This is really the first day
that it's worked properly.

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:22.150
So it sounds wonderful.
 

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.808
It's glorious.
 

00:24:22.808 --> 00:24:25.577
It's a glorious climax that
Wagner has been working for--for

00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:27.078
three hours here,
that we've got,

00:24:27.078 --> 00:24:28.298
that we've arrived at.
 

00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:30.380
But now he's going to turn
everything around.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.029
The entire sentiment is going
to change.

00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:36.480
And I think we should be able
enumerate here,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.317
maybe as many as four different
ways in which Wagner does turn

00:24:40.317 --> 00:24:43.838
our emotions one hundred eighty
degrees at this point.

00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:46.127
So we're going to go back,
and we're going to listen to

00:24:46.127 --> 00:24:48.119
the climax again,
and then we're going to listen

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:49.348
to how the music changes.
 

00:24:49.348 --> 00:24:50.737
And I want you to,
as you sit there,

00:24:50.737 --> 00:24:52.164
to think about,
"What's he doing

00:24:52.164 --> 00:24:52.759
here?"
 

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:57.311
You're the composer;
how do you make something go

00:24:57.311 --> 00:25:03.740
from sort of cradle in your arms
to vision of the world beyond.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.564
So think about dynamics,
think about tempo,

00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:10.194
think about these sequences,
consonance and dissonance,

00:25:10.194 --> 00:25:11.538
etc., etc., etc.
 

00:25:11.538 --> 00:27:12.140
Okay, here we go.&lt;&lt;plays
music&gt;&gt;

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.299
Well, I hope you liked that.
 

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:15.940
Really gorgeous.
 

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.190
So get me started here.
 

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.108
What did you hear there?
 

00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:26.039
How did he slow down this
entire train?

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:27.480
Yes?
 

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.240
Student:  It got softer.
 

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240
Prof: So the whole thing
got softer.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.558
So we're going to take the
basics first.

00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:35.362
And that would be number one on
my list--the whole thing got

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:35.789
softer.
 

00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:38.818
What else happened?
 

00:27:38.818 --> 00:27:42.817
Not only soft--although the
voice ended up rather high--what

00:27:42.817 --> 00:27:44.920
are the last sounds we heard?
 

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.950
&gt;
 

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.058
It also ended lower.
 

00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:51.164
And we talked about high and
low intention,

00:27:51.164 --> 00:27:52.618
that sort of thing,
before.

00:27:52.618 --> 00:27:56.556
Softer, maybe lower generally
in terms of the tessitura,

00:27:56.556 --> 00:27:57.630
or the range.
 

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.549
What else?
 

00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:01.858
Chris?
 

00:28:01.858 --> 00:28:03.278
Student:  The tempo got
slower.

00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:03.987
Prof: Yes.
 

00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:06.068
There were some points that the
tempo got slower.

00:28:06.068 --> 00:28:08.942
And we'll talk about that in
just a minute if we hit on

00:28:08.942 --> 00:28:10.059
anything else here.
 

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:12.460
Anything else?
 

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:12.920
Elizabeth?
 

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.470
Student:  Fewer
instruments?

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.859
Prof: Well,
they weren't playing as loud.

00:28:18.859 --> 00:28:20.509
They weren't quite as obvious.
 

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:22.568
I'm not sure that there were
fewer instruments.

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:24.057
My guess is,
if I were to look at that

00:28:24.057 --> 00:28:26.106
score, it would be huge and
everybody would still be

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:26.588
playing.
 

00:28:26.588 --> 00:28:30.309
It's just that it sounded fewer
because they were playing more

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:30.920
quietly.
 

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:38.548
What about--Roger?
 

00:28:38.548 --> 00:28:40.769
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:43.098
Prof: Yes,
he used the dissonance.

00:28:43.098 --> 00:28:45.075
For example,
we had that snake idea,

00:28:45.075 --> 00:28:47.670
that snake in the Garden of
Eden: &lt;&lt;plays

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.630
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:54.238
He was writhing around there,
but then he took it up two more

00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:59.752
degrees and folded it in to a
consonance, so it was all very

00:28:59.752 --> 00:29:02.089
consonant at the end.
 

00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:04.220
What about the sequence?
 

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:11.150
It was a--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.704
It was rising,
rising, rising,

00:29:15.704 --> 00:29:23.558
but here at the end it started
doing: &lt;&lt;plays

00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:26.230
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.998
It's just repeating the same
pitches over and over and over

00:29:28.998 --> 00:29:29.380
again.
 

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.740
He took that out of the
equation, too.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.039
He backed out of this idea,
of the sequence.

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.390
It's static at this point.
 

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.155
We have stasis,
we have arrival,

00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:37.838
stability.
 

00:29:37.838 --> 00:29:42.260
What was the one thing that we
haven't mentioned in terms of

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.759
the tonality here?
 

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:47.180
&gt;
 

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.190
There at the end--what is that
last sound?

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.920
Very strongly, the tonic.
 

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.259
&gt;
 

00:29:58.259 --> 00:29:59.960
That's the way it ended.
 

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.038
There was one other thing that
was kind of cool here.

00:30:02.038 --> 00:30:04.928
I'm trying to think of the
exact-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:05.848
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:14.058
We had that kind of sound--
&gt;

00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:19.548
Supposing I went--
&gt;

00:30:19.548 --> 00:30:21.420
Does this have any resonance to
you?

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.240
&gt;
 

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.579
Where are you,
if you hear this sound?

00:30:27.579 --> 00:30:30.200
Hmm?
 

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.880
&gt;
 

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.022
Maybe in Yale Commencement
where we sing hymns or at church

00:30:36.022 --> 00:30:37.808
or something like that.
 

00:30:37.808 --> 00:30:43.318
But we would call that an
Amen--an Amen cadence.

00:30:43.318 --> 00:30:46.686
What does that bring to the--it
sort of brings the divine

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:47.828
benediction here.
 

00:30:47.828 --> 00:30:51.059
Now, the nineteenth century,
life is more

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:54.130
painful--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.759
But you have a sense here at
the end that they're living a

00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:01.694
blessed existence in heaven;
it may be because Wagner has

00:31:01.694 --> 00:31:05.311
folded in, sort of subliminally,
below the surface,

00:31:05.311 --> 00:31:06.470
this cadence.
 

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.406
We have deceptive cadences
here, and we have another kind

00:31:10.406 --> 00:31:13.711
of cadence called an Amen
cadence that brings an

00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:17.190
additional resonance--
an additional symbolism to the

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.848
conclusion.
 

00:31:17.848 --> 00:31:20.568
So it's a wonderful piece of
music,

00:31:20.568 --> 00:31:24.813
and maybe--I think we have
time--let's listen to just the

00:31:24.813 --> 00:31:29.012
last few seconds of that again,
because it recaps some of the

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.470
points we've been making.
 

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:40.289
&gt;
 

00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:42.759
Here's the snake going away.
 

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:44.769
Here's the consonance.
 

00:31:44.769 --> 00:32:09.710
 
 

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.730
Okay, good.
 

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.528
So that's the Liebestod
of Richard Wagner.

00:32:13.528 --> 00:32:14.806
Questions about that?
 

00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:16.021
Thoughts about that?
 

00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:17.358
Comments about that?
 

00:32:17.358 --> 00:32:19.836
All right, if not,
let's go on to talk about

00:32:19.836 --> 00:32:22.200
Mozart, a little bit more about
Mozart.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.990
We're going to hear another
aria by Mozart,

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.618
and this one does something a
little bit different than--

00:32:27.618 --> 00:32:30.266
well, it's a kind of
combination of what we've just

00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:31.058
studied here.
 

00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:34.088
We've got a highly structured
aria by Mozart;

00:32:34.088 --> 00:32:37.300
yet at the same time,
we're going to see an example

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.548
of rising melodic sequence in
it.

00:32:39.548 --> 00:32:42.809
And we have a guest artist
today: Lauren Libaw.

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:44.039
So Lauren, come on up.
 

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:46.578
Some of you know Lauren;
she's in Davenport College.

00:32:46.578 --> 00:32:49.622
And I've known her for years
now because she is a music

00:32:49.622 --> 00:32:51.440
major,
and I've seen her sing in lots

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.082
of different productions--
in the School of Music's

00:32:54.082 --> 00:32:57.250
Orpheus and the
Underworld a year or so ago.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:03.500
So, Lauren, I know that you've
sung with the Los Angeles Opera,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.098
and I remember that you sang
with David Stern in Brussels--

00:33:08.098 --> 00:33:09.730
was it Brussels or Paris or
both?

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:09.980
Student:  Both.
 

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.788
Prof: Both.
 

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:13.730
Probably at Le
Châtelet in Paris?

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.992
Yes.
 

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:17.750
The Châtelet
Theater, the big metro change.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.820
So she's a very experienced
singer, and a very,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.088
very good singer.
 

00:33:22.088 --> 00:33:25.403
But tell us,
Lauren, what do you want to do

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:26.349
with this?
 

00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:28.299
Here you are at Yale;
you could become an opera

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:31.277
singer or you could go to law
school and work for Skadden Arps

00:33:31.277 --> 00:33:34.058
in New York or Los Angeles or
whatever you want to do.

00:33:34.058 --> 00:33:36.019
What are you going to do with
all this?

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:39.588
Student:  I would like
to pursue a career in opera;

00:33:39.588 --> 00:33:43.140
law school isn't for me,
although I do like to argue.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.538
Sorry, parents.
 

00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:47.648
Prof: So this year,
if you're a senior,

00:33:47.648 --> 00:33:49.288
are you going to take a year
off?

00:33:49.288 --> 00:33:51.896
Or are you going to apply
directly to graduate schools in

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:52.269
voice?
 

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:54.124
And where are you going to
apply if you're feeling to do

00:33:54.124 --> 00:33:54.358
that?
 

00:33:54.358 --> 00:33:59.627
Student:  Actually,
I'm going to go back to work

00:33:59.627 --> 00:34:02.358
with David Stern in Paris.
 

00:34:02.358 --> 00:34:03.880
Prof: So you're in that
already?

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.476
Student:  Yes.
 

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:07.680
He very kindly has asked me.
 

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.900
Prof: David Stern was a
Yale undergraduate.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.340
He is the son--and he was the
nicest boy--the son of who?

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.829
Of whom?
 

00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:17.630
Stern? Does that ring a bell?
 

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.034
Isaac Stern,
the world-famous--one of the

00:34:20.034 --> 00:34:22.860
greatest violinists of the
twentieth century.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.215
So David was an undergraduate
here, graduated probably fifteen

00:34:26.215 --> 00:34:28.800
or so years ago,
went on to a career in music as

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.670
a conductor, mostly in Europe.
 

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.759
Student:  I think he
told me that he was a TA for

00:34:33.759 --> 00:34:34.489
this class.
 

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.438
Prof: He would come in
from time to time,

00:34:37.438 --> 00:34:39.510
and we would do things in here.
 

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.302
As an undergraduate,
he was not a TA--but then he

00:34:43.302 --> 00:34:47.409
was a conductor for the YSO for
a couple of years.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.702
So he would come in from time
to time and we would do

00:34:49.702 --> 00:34:50.539
different things.
 

00:34:50.539 --> 00:34:54.849
So Lauren, as I've mentioned,
is a very experienced singer,

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:57.202
and we're going to do a little
aria here out of Mozart's

00:34:57.202 --> 00:34:58.905
Figaro,
his opera The Marriage of

00:34:58.905 --> 00:35:01.076
Figaro,
1786, called "Voi che

00:35:01.076 --> 00:35:02.000
sapete."
 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.469
So Lauren, can you tell us
something about this aria?

00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:08.000
Who's singing it?
 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.445
Student:  This aria is
sung by Cherubino,

00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:14.744
who is a young boy,
actuallyâ€“I'm wearing

00:35:14.744 --> 00:35:16.650
pants for the purpose.
 

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.260
It's called a "trouser
role" for that reason.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.449
It's sung by a woman.
 

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:25.900
Prof: Why do they do
that?

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:32.630
Did the weird opera people like
transvestites or something?

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.914
There are other roles like
this--it's just kind a

00:35:36.914 --> 00:35:38.880
convention in opera.
 

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.010
Student:  He is a young
boy--so maybe the high voice--

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.327
Prof: He's an
adolescent, fourteen,

00:35:45.327 --> 00:35:47.250
and what's he experiencing
here?

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.340
Student:  First love or
first lust.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.510
Prof: He's not sure.
 

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.869
Student:  He's not sure.
 

00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:59.336
He's singing to the Countess,
with whom he's in love--with a

00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:01.840
little help from Susanna.
 

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.190
Prof: Susanna?
 

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.980
So he thinks he's in love with
the countess,

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.896
but maybe it's Susanna or maybe
it's Barbarina,

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:09.768
or maybe it's that broomstick
over there.

00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:12.987
It's really hard to know
exactly whom he's in love with

00:36:12.987 --> 00:36:14.059
at age fourteen.
 

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:17.909
That's the confusion here.
 

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:20.590
So if there's a certain
palpitation from time to time,

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:24.018
it's intentional here--and a
certain sense of being

00:36:24.018 --> 00:36:25.927
flustered,
almost--agitated or

00:36:25.927 --> 00:36:28.980
flustered--you're uncertain
about what these things are.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.460
We're going to have Lauren sing
all of this for us.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.804
But in order to have this be
something other than just a

00:36:36.804 --> 00:36:41.385
performance, I'd like to work
through different pedagogical

00:36:41.385 --> 00:36:42.650
issues here.
 

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.969
So let's talk about that just
for a second.

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:48.802
Now, at the outset of this,
and you guys have your sheets

00:36:48.802 --> 00:36:50.965
out there;
there's a sheet on the music

00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:53.079
stand back there--you've got a
sheet.

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:55.190
So take a look at that.
 

00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:00.429
And we'll see--what do you
see--Marcus?

00:37:00.429 --> 00:37:03.474
Right down here in the front
row, what do you see on your

00:37:03.474 --> 00:37:04.780
sheet by way of music?
 

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.512
Student:  That it's
broken up into two different

00:37:11.512 --> 00:37:12.510
parts.
 

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.269
Three, I guess.
 

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:14.320
Prof: Three.
 

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.005
And they're labeled
"antecedent"

00:37:16.005 --> 00:37:17.199
and "consequent."
 

00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:20.445
So Mozart starts out here with
the antecedent and consequent

00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:21.489
phrase structure.
 

00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:29.630
&gt;
 

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.809
That was the antecedent;
here comes consequent.

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:37.460
&gt;
 

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.530
So antecedent/consequent.
 

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.166
Then, interestingly enough,
when the voice comes in,

00:37:43.166 --> 00:37:45.019
what does he do,
Lauren?

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:46.610
What does he do there?
 

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.489
You have to sing-- you just
don't duplicate what I did.

00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:53.360
Student:  He actually
expands different structure by

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.829
adding more material in the
middle.

00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:57.429
Prof: So he had an A and
B,

00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:00.378
but his mind is such--I mean,
I'd never be able to figure

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.068
that out--
he said, "Well,

00:38:02.068 --> 00:38:05.030
I can open this whole thing up
and put in some additional

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.237
lovely music,
and then close it back down

00:38:07.237 --> 00:38:09.320
with my consequent phrase
structure."

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.199
So we have that.
 

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:12.670
Let's listen to how that plays
out.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:16.043
So we'll just start with where
you come in, Lauren,

00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:18.000
with "Voi,"
okay?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:44.518
&lt;&lt;plays piano while
student sings&gt;&gt;

00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:47.960
And then we go on with a series
of phrases, and as you listen to

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.239
this, you might count the number
of bars and phrases here.

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:54.025
But generally speaking,
they're all four bars in

00:38:54.025 --> 00:38:54.559
length.
 

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:57.552
Mozart is one of the guys that
puts this whole idea of

00:38:57.552 --> 00:38:59.530
structure with melody on the
map.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:04.650
Structure, symmetry are very
important in his compositions.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.461
And as we proceed here,
the text gets more and more

00:39:07.461 --> 00:39:08.250
interesting.
 

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:12.710
We start talking about feelings
at line five there.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.579
"Sento un
affetto"--how would you

00:39:15.579 --> 00:39:18.449
translate, I guess we have a
translator.

00:39:18.449 --> 00:39:19.670
Student:  "Sento un
affetto."

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.324
"I feel,"--&amp;qu
ot;affetto"

00:39:21.324 --> 00:39:23.309
in Italian, that's like
"something."

00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.856
Prof: Emotion?
 

00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:24.429
Student:  Yes.
 

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:27.923
Prof: And then sometimes
he is really happy,

00:39:27.923 --> 00:39:31.070
and then sometimes he's sort of
despairing.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.132
What's kind of cool,
when we get over to the

00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:37.478
despairing idea here on the
piano--&lt;&lt;plays

00:39:37.478 --> 00:39:38.690
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:44.809
We're here, and we go
to--&gt;

00:39:44.809 --> 00:39:49.880
And then he's going to be
burning like a flame and then

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.295
freezing to death,
so we get the weird harmonies

00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:58.239
out here as he's freezing and
thawing.

00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:04.077
So let's hear just a little
bit, maybe with--from there--at

00:40:04.077 --> 00:40:07.699
"Sento un affetto"
okay?

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:43.570
&lt;&lt;plays piano while
student sings&gt;&gt;

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.320
Okay.
 

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.775
Now we're going to go on to a
little bit later--lovely,

00:40:46.775 --> 00:40:47.550
lovely, lovely.
 

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.280
We're going to go on to a
little bit later.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:53.793
If you can follow on your text
to "Sospiro e gemo senza

00:40:53.793 --> 00:40:57.849
voler, palpito e tremo senza
saper" and so on.

00:40:57.849 --> 00:41:02.518
What does Mozart do here in
terms of structure?

00:41:02.518 --> 00:41:08.054
Student:  A sequence He
repeats the same series of notes

00:41:08.054 --> 00:41:12.608
progressively higher,
to illustrate--as you hear the

00:41:12.608 --> 00:41:16.929
notes rising--angst--
Prof: Good. Agitation.

00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:21.789
So pick it up here at the
B-flat, and I'll try to catch

00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:22.239
up.
 

00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:49.780
&lt;&lt;plays music while
student&gt;&gt;

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.376
Okay, so notice there,
how as we come to the end of

00:41:53.376 --> 00:41:57.764
that, we work up there--it rises
up through the rising melodic

00:41:57.764 --> 00:41:58.699
sequence.
 

00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:01.960
We get--Lauren hits that high
note up there,

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.980
and then comes off of
it--that's the climax,

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.210
the peak of the whole aria--
and then the bass,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.119
what's the bass doing?
 

00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:14.550
 
 

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:21.119
It's sort of sneaking back down
to the tonic.

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:26.590
And when we get back to the
tonic, then it comes in.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.320
We're going to pick it up from
there.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.786
Lauren, we're going to sing to
that when we get over there to

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:36.500
&gt;
 

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.693
just hold on "cor"
and we'll ask them a question:

00:42:39.693 --> 00:42:40.849
What happened here?
 

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:42.690
What do we have here?
 

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.269
We'll see if you can hold on
that "cor."

00:42:45.269 --> 00:42:48.530
From the "voi."
 

00:42:48.530 --> 00:43:17.550
&lt;&lt;plays piano while
student sings&gt;&gt;

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.760
Prof: Nice.
 

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.980
So what did Mozart do there?
 

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.940
What was that?
 

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.489
Student:  Had a
deceptive cadence.

00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:27.829
Prof: Had a deceptive
cadence--good,

00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:29.280
Marcus scores big today.
 

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:37.070
We're sitting here on this:
&gt;

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.760
We want it to go:
&gt;

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.150
But instead it goes:
&gt;

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.920
That's the "cor."
 

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:57.664
And then we have our flyover:
&lt;&lt;plays piano while

00:43:57.664 --> 00:44:01.389
student sings&gt;&gt;
 

00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.639
And that's the way it ends.
 

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:04.920
So you come back to the tonic,
okay?

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.199
We've arrived. We've landed.
 

00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:11.619
All right, I think we have time
to do the whole thing now from

00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:15.440
beginning to end,
and we'll get our pages in

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.329
order.
 

00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:20.038
So, Lauren Libaw singing
"Voi che sapete"

00:44:20.038 --> 00:44:23.449
from Mozart's The Marriage
of Figaro.

00:44:23.449 --> 00:47:23.239
&lt;&lt;plays piano while
student sings&gt;&gt;

00:47:23.239 --> 00:47:36.769
&gt;
 

00:47:36.769 --> 00:47:38.400
Lovely, lovely, lovely.
 

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.088
Aren't we fortunate to have
such talented students here at

00:47:41.088 --> 00:47:41.420
Yale?
 

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.010
Okay, well thank you all very
much.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.001
We'll play a little more
Puccini on your way out,

00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:49.679
and I hope you enjoy this day
as beautiful as all this music

00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:50.489
has been.
 

00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:56.000
